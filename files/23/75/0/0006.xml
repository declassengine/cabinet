INDIA.Cotton Duties(previous reference:Cabinet 67(31), Con-clusion 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Indian Tariff Board&apos;sReport on Cotton Goods:-34 (33) ifA Note by the President of the Eoardof Trade (CP.-5 (33)) covering aMemorandum prepared in the Board ofTrade,    In his Note the Presidentconfessed that he had found it difficultto conceive of proposals which would arouse greater and more justifiablehostility in Lancashire.    The increasein the actual Duties charged on a large part of our exports and the withdrawalof the difference between the duties on British and foreign goods werecalculated to affect Lancashire&apos;s trademost seriously at a time when there were some signs of recovery from the deepesttrough of depression, and the putting into force of the Tariff Board&apos;srecommendations would be inconsistent with the undertaking contained inArticle 11 of the Trade Agreement with india:A Note by the Secretary of State forIndia (CP .-8 (33)) stating that hewas fully alive to the considerations set forth by the President of the Boardof Trade;   that he had always contem-plated that the matter should bediscussed in the Cabinet as soon asthe views of the Government of india had been obtained;    that in his opinionno discussion could usefully take placein the Cabinet until then, as it was by no means to be assumed that the Govern-ment of India would adopt the recommenda-tions of the Tariff Board, and. that itwas their views rather than the tariff board&apos;s recommendations which the cabinet would have to consider.The President of the Board of Trade gave the Cabinet^evidence of the very strong feeling that had beenaroused in all sections of the cotton trade by informs-tion that had reached them as to the nature of theelndian Tariff Board&apos;s Report, which was considered toeaten a disastrous: blow to Lancashire.I      In the course of a full statement on this quest.ion the Secretary of .State for India mentioned that in this
basis.   The Board&apos;s tariff proposals had been basedon the working of a second-class mill, and providedfor a specific tariff.   The Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that the Government of India did not propose to submit the Tariff Board&apos;s recommendations to the^Snera^ Assembly.   They would, however, haveto substitute some reasonable scheme for that containedin the Report.   They proposed to leave the CottonDuties fQii the ycnr IT fir ri ,r nit r&quot;nnn*&quot;&quot;r&apos;t ( and Wltilinsix months to produce a substitute scheme in consulta-tion with the Secretary of State.   The Government ofIndia had full justification for taking such a line in the fact that the discussions with the indian delegation at Ottawa had been based on the principleof differentiation referred to above.   It was not proposed to publish the Report of the Tariff Boardhere or in India, but the Secretary of State proposedto set up a Committee in the India Office,with theaddition of representatives of the Board of Trade, towork on the production of a substitute scheme.The Cabinet noted that although the Report wtrendered to the Government of India, it was obvioithat a great deal of information as to its contentshad leaked out, and that the Lancashire cotton indusrty was well informed on the subject.In the course of the discussion the Cabinet were informed that at Ottawa the United Kingdom delegates had been given tc^understand that the principle ofdifferentiation  Jl .  0*t&quot;/^^  sh^^airierentiatxon w*e--a^e**^^ although not laid down in any specific document.iras3 us
The Cabinet congratulated the Secretary of state on his handling of this question, and agreed(a) To fall in with the proposal of theSecretary of State for India that theGovernment of India should leave theDuties at their existing level for thepresent, and that within six months afresh scheme should be substituted forthat of the Tariff Board;    and to take note that it was not proposed to publish the Tariff Board&apos;s Report:(b) That as the Government of India&apos;s decisions would,  in the normal course of events, be announced in the Indian Legislature shortly.,it would be improper, particularly in afiscal matter of this kind, to anticipateit by any announcement in the House ofCommons of their intentions:    It would be  . oisufficient to state, in reply to questions in Parliament, that the matter was underconsideration and that an announcement wouldbe made in India during the present sessionof the Indian Legislature;(c) That the Secretary of State for India andthe President of the Board of Trade shouldtake such steps as they might deem advisable to discourage representatives of the lancashire cotton industry, pending the announcementreferred to in (b), from making requests,either in or out of Parliament, for detailed information on the subject, and from themselvesmaking public what they believed to be the contents of the Report of the Tariff Board,:
FA.INDIA. 4*   Tlie Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by reduction of   the Secretary of State for India (C.P.-14 (33)) onslrvJcesf1^ the subject of Reduction of Pay of Indian Services.In this Memorandum the Secretary of State, after(Reference:     reviewing the difficulties of the Indian Budget,?3lKeCon-     discussed proposals that were under consideration forelusion 10.) topQsition Qf an ex0ise duty on matches, which was opposed by the majority of the Governor-General&apos;council, and cuts in pay, which the Government of India(with the exception of the Army Member) were unanimous in urging, in view of the financial position, should bere-imposed in full.    In.the light of the situation thusdisclosed, the Secretary of State had reached the con-elusion, though with great reluctance, that acquiescence in the continuance of some cut in pay for another year from April 1st next was unavoidable.   As the result of communications, however, with the Government of India,the latter (including the Army Member) had reluctantlyacquiesced in a reduction of the cut from 10 per cent,to 5 per cent.   At the same time the Secretary of State. held himself free to consider whether even this halfcut could not be restored before March 31, 1934, if theopening months of the new financial year should proveunexpectedly prosperous.    In the case of British service officers he proposed to apply mutatis mutandis the samearrangements for relief in regard to the 5 per cent, exitas had been agreed upon for the present cut of 10 percent.   The Secretary of State added that if his colleagues agreed with his view that the partial continuance of the cut was unavoidable, it would be necessary, as in 1931,to pass a measure through Parliament taking power, inthe ease of statutorily protected Officers, to make thenecessary abatement from pay up to but not exceeding5 per cent, and limited in its operation to March 31, 1934.
In the course of a statement the Secretary ofState for India asked the Cabinet to agree to thereducedapplication of .a cut to the Indian Services/from10 per cent, to 5 per cent.   He stated that although his own advisers favoured the introduction of anexcise duty on matches, he did not wish to press theViceroy and his Council too far.    He had decided,therefore, to take the financial risk of not imposingthe tax,^he Cabinet dismissed at some length the questionof whether, in the existing financial situation inIndia and elsewhere, the 10 per cent, cut in india could be reduced without serious reactions in theUnited Kingdom, the Colonies and Dependencies;    also as to whether this concession would not provide an unfortunate example to future Indian Governmentswhen the reform scheme had come to full development.The Secretary of State for India emphasised thedifference of the Indian Services owing to the specialguarantee by Parliament.    If that were allowed tolapse into the background it would be said that the cuts were never to be restored.    If that.were believedthere would be great difficulty in obtaining candidates for the Secretary of State&apos;s Services in India.The exercise of the Viceroy&apos;&apos;s powers under the reformscheme depended upon these Services .    If suitablecandidates were not forthcoming it would be saidduring the Debates in Parliament that the safeguardswere unworkable for this reason.    It would also besaid by the critics of the scheme&quot; that   even, Parlia-mentary guarantees were of no value.   The financial situation in India, though not stabilised, had much improved since the original cuts were imposed.   TheCouncil of India, who had to be consulted on these-7-
questions, were unanimously opposed to the re-impositionof the 10 per cent, exit owing to its adverse effects on the Indian Services .^he Cabinet were also reminded that whereas theeffect of cuts in the United Kingdom had been reducedto a considerable extent by the fall in prices,  this wasnot the case in India, where the tariff had resultedin an increase in the cost of living of Europeans,Moreover, Civil Servants and Military Officers in india had to keep up   a certain position, and often to main-tain a separate establishment at home for the education of their families.    In many cases, owing to the cuts,their position was one of great difficulty.   The cabinet were also informed that the Army Council and the air council objected strongly to the renewal of the 10 percent, cut, and. could only acquiesce most reluctantlyin the 5 per cent, cut, and in this case subject to the adjustment of individual cases where the cut pressedespecially hardly.The Cabinet were informed that it was not likely that there would be any serious reaction in the services in this country, or in the Colonies or Protectorates,to a reduction in the cut in India of 5 per cent.The Cabinet agreeo.  (a) To approve the proposal of the Secretaryof State for India for a cut in the pay of the Indian Services during 1933-34,reduced from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent.,and that the imposition of the matchexcise duty should not be pressed onthe Indian Government:(b) That in introducing the Bill to impose the 5 per cent, cut, the Secretary ofState for India, after consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, shouldmake clear that the circumstances of theIndian Services were exceptional.
THE ECONOMY CUTS .(previous reference:Cabinet S(S3),  Con-clusion 4.)7(li)i.5, The Prime Minister read the following draft reply that had been prepared in the Treasury forconsideration by the Cabinet, to the Questions that were being asked as to the possible restoration of economy cuts:-&quot;The present financial situationoffers no hope that it will be possiblein the near future to restore the cutsin pay as limited by the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement of the 31st September, 1951.I may add that no increase in thesecuts js at present contemplated either&quot;.After discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) ^at the reply should be as follows:-&quot;The present financial situationoffers no hope that it will bepossible in the near future to restore the cuts in pay as limited by the Prime Minister&apos;s statementof the 21st September, 1931.I may add that no increase inthese cuts has been, considered byth e Gr ov ernme nt&quot;.(b) That Ministers should, be&apos; invited toconsider the above wording carefullyas affecting their respective Depart-ments, and, if they saw any objection,to communicate at once with the PrimeMinister.(c) That the Prime Minister,  in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer,should have authority to vary the wordingif this was found necessary.An

hous img(financial provisions)bill.(previous reference:Cabinet 65(32), Con-clusion 9.)F.R.7, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (CP.-15 (33)) on the Housing(Financial Provisions) Bill, in which, he stated thatsupporters of the Government were agitating for twoadditions to the Bill;    (l) to make further provisionfor improving slums by re-conditioning houses not badenough to pull down;    and (2) to encourage the provisionor holding of small houses by public utility societies and similar bodies.   He proposed, if his colleagues agreed, to inform the House at an early opportunity in debate, that he intended, as soon as the Bill was passed,to set up a Departmental Committee to consider thesequestions, and to state expressly that the referencemust be subject to the declared policy of the government as to the cessation of the direct subsidies under theActs of 1923 and 1924, and that direct subsidies cannotbe replaced by indirect.   To this principle he proposed a minor exception, to which the Chancellor of theExchequer had no objection, viz., that the Committeeshould not be precluded from considering the necessityof some sort of help from the Exchequer for re-condition-ing in urban areas as well as rural.    Such an announce-ment, he felt, would do much to satisfy the chiefadvocates of further legislation.In approving the proposals of the Minister ofHealth, as summarised above, the Cabinet invited theMinister -(a) To take action at once with a view tosetting up the Departmental Committeeand not to announce that this would only be done &quot;as soon as the Bill is passed&quot;:(b) In the Departmental Oommittee&apos;s referenceto provide for consideration of re-conditionineand the promotion of the building andownership of small houses not only by public utility societies but by other bodies of similar constitution:
(c) Not to commit himself to legislation during the present Session, owing tothe difficulties of the parliamentary time-table.The Minister of Health acceptedall these suggestions ,
