1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (C,P,-73 (33)-)circulating to his&apos; colleagues the form of Motionwhich he proposed to place on the Order paper as the basis for the Debate on March 27th andfollowing days on the subject of the Appointmentof the Joint Select Committee on the Indian white paper.    The text of the proposed Motion was asfollows&quot;That,, before taking any decision upon the Proposals contained in cmd, 4268, it is expedient thata Joint Select Committee of lords and Commons, with power to callinto consultation representativesof the Indian States and of british india, be appointed to consider thefuture government of India and, inparticular, to examine and report upon the Proposals in the saidCommand. Paper&quot;,The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that he had information that Mr churchill and the Conservative group of Members of parliament that were acting with him were trying to find an amendment which would increase the number of Memberssupporting them.   The Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury had learned that the amendment most favoured was the addition of words at the beginningof the Resolution &quot;before taking any decision&quot;, orwords to that effect.   This amendment was harmlessin itself, because in any event no decision wouldbe taken until after the Joint Select Committee had reported.    On the other hand, if moved as an amend-ment it might prove embarrassing.   If the Governmentrefused to accept it it would be said that there was something at the back of their minds that was not known to the House and that decisions&apos; had already
his supporters would claim it as a victory over theGovernment.   Consequently the Secretary of Stateand the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury had formed the idea of inserting the words in the originalResolution as set forth above and underlined.   TheClerks of the Table had taken the view that the wordswere redundant, and had suggested that there was something to be said for not departing from the usualwording of a Resolution of this kind.    That morning&quot;he had seen the Speaker, who had been inclined toaccept the words.    This afternoon he had seen the speaker again and, without taking a very strong line,the Speaker had suggested that the words were otioseand possibly out of order.    He had added that if thewords were moved/ during the Debate he would rule them out of order.   The objection to that course was that until Monday no-one would know that the words wouldbe ruled out of .order, and when this happened&apos;, itwould be whispered that there had been collusionbetween the Government and the Speaker.    If theCabinet agreed, the Secretary of State said that hewould like to go to the Speaker once more and saythat the Cabinet attached importance to the additionof the words underlined above.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasuryendorsed the account of the circumstances given bythe Secretary of State for India.    For his part, evenif the Speaker said that the Motion was out of order,he would like to put it down in that form in order to compel the Speaker to rule it out officially andpublicly, after which a new Resolution would have tobe introduced.    The House of Commons would then havito be told that as the words had been ruled out ofthe Resolution Parliament would have to accept the
undertaking of the Government that no decisions would be taken until after the Joint SelectCommittee had considered the question.The Secretary of State for War said that he hadnot much liked the words, which seemed to him otiosebut that was before he had heard how the House ofCommons would be affected.    He did not think theywould do much harm in the ^ouse of Lords.   He asked what would happen if the House of Lords, in passing the Resolution, put down an instruction to theCommittee&apos;?The Secretary of State for India undertook to look into this,In the course of the discussion various suggestions were made for amending the wording, ofthe phrase &quot;before taking any decision upon theproposals contained in Cmd. 4268&quot;.   The first wasto put &quot;before Parliament is invited to take any decision&quot;.   The Clerks of the Table had said thatthis meant one House binding the other.   An alterna-tive suggestion was &quot;before any decision is taken&quot; .A third proposal was  &quot;before this House is invitedto take any decision&quot;.The Secretary of State for India undertook toconsider the precise wording further.One or two other points of detail were mentionedwhich are recorded in the Conclusions below.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forIndia should see the Speaker again and inform him that the Cabinetattached importance to the insertion of words to the same effect as thoseappearing in the draft, &quot;before taking any decision upon the proposals contained in Cmd. 4268&quot;.   He shouldhave discretion to amend the wordingin accordance with suggestions made during the Meeting of the cabinet or in order to get agreement withthe Speaker of the House of Commons,
which he was asked to reach, ifpossible.    In the last resort,however, he was given authorityto put down the Motion with theinclusion of some such phraseas the above,  even at the risk of having it over-ruled by the Speaker,unless he wished to consult theCabinet again:(b) Subject to the above, to approve the form of the Motion:(c) That the Motion should be sent inon Tuesday, March 21st, with aview to being circulated onWednesday, March 22nd:(d) That the Secretary of State forIndia, in consultation with theParliamentary Secretary to theTreasury, should examine whatthe position would be if theHouse of Lords, in passing theResolution, moved instructions tothe Committee.
THE PRIME 2,    The Secretary was instructed to send to minister&apos; visit TO Paris a telegram congratulating the Prime MinisterROME.on the success  of his visit to Rome.The actual telegram despatched was as follows :-&quot;The Cabinet, on meeting for thefirst time since your visit to rome, congratulate   you verywarmly on your success and look forward to meeting you on Wednesday&quot;.
&amp;HF PAR EAST,iThe Armst Embargo.((previous Reference:! Cabinet 17I (33), Con-I elus ion 1,)3.   The Secretary of State for War informed theCabinet that on Saturday he had. received an applica-tion from his Department to sell to Japan anexplosive unit for a catapult.   Although the embargo had been removed^ he himself had taken theview that there was a difference between the stipplyof goods by private firms and by the Government, andhe had instructed the War Office that they mustreply to the effect that the Government could not themselves furnish the article required.   A reply tothis effect had been sent that morning.   He gathered that the firm in question would be able to obtainthe explosive unit elsewhere but that more time would be required.The Cabinet approved the actionof the Secretary of State for War-.*     *     72, Whitehall Gardens, S.W,i,March 20,  1933.
