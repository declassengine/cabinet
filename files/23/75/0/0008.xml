LEAKAGE OP 1*   The Prime Minister drew the attention of the TNFORMAT ION *r the Cabinet to a leakage which had occurred in(previous &quot;The Times&quot; of February 9th, as well as in &quot;TheCabinet0?&quot;       Evening News&quot; of the same date, in regard to theilusionQ4T)     Chancellor of the Exchequers &quot;Statutory Commission&quot;F.R. r proposals .   These proposals had been before the11 rW&apos; Unemployment Insurance Committee since December 2ndlast.   The Committee had held three Meetings.   the memoranda and Minutes on the subject had all been treated as especially secret, and the greatestprecautions had been taken to prevent leakage.   It vtasnot until two days after the meeting of parliament that the leakage had occurred.The Cabinet were informed that the Lobby Corres-correspondent of &quot;mhe Times&quot; had stated that he had obtained the information in the Lobby of the House of commons and that there had been talk on the subject amongback-bench Members for some time.It was suggested that as a similar proposal hadbeen discussed in the Report of the Royal Commissionit was conceivable that an adroit correspondent mighthave pieced together a good deal of information,without any leakage having occurred.   This explanation,however, hardly seemed consistent with the phrase thatthe proposal &quot;commands considerable support from.some ministers&quot;   which gave the impression of insideinformation.The Prime Minister said that in his own office the Cabinet Minutes were brought direct to him.   If he* f0Und &quot; necessary to open the sealed envelope, he himself mentioned the fact on the envelope and Ve-sealedit himself.   He understood that in some Offices this-1-
procedure would be impracticable as it was necessaryto inform the Department promptly of some of thedecisions, and this involved the Minutes being dealtwith by a Private Secretary.The Prime Minister asked his colleagues -(a) To warn any persons in their respective departments who were allowed access to cabinet Minutes that they must be confined within the narrowest possiblecircle consistent with administrativeefficiency?    and(b) That particular precautions should betaken to avoid any leakage in regardto the Instructions to His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington on War Debts ,(On the suggestion of the Lord President ofthe Council, all copies of the Paperscirculated on the subject of War Debtswere returned to the Secretary at the endof the Meeting, i.e., C,P,-28 (33),CP .-28 (33) Revise, and CP.-29 (33).The Secretary took steps to recover copiesfrom ab s ent minister ers .)-2-
2.   The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the British War Debt tothe United States of America:-A first draft of Memoranda for Instruc-tions to His Majestyfs Ambassador atWashington (CP .-28 (33)), prepared bythe Cabinet Committee on War Debts asa basis for discussion at their meetingarranged for the morning of Monday,February 13th, 19 33:A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (CP,-29 (33)) covering a telegram by His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Washington to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs which contained afull account of Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;s interview with Mr Roosevelt, the UnitedStates President-Elect, on January 29th,1933.At the outset of the Meeting the Secretary handed round a Revise of the Memoranda for Instructions toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador (CP,-28 (33)) as approvedby the Cabinet Committee the same morning for submission to the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Foreigi Affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to the amendments of substance that had been introduced as the result ofthe last meeting of the Cabinet Committee.The Cabinet then discussed the Memoranda for instructions paragraph by paragraph.In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to a slight discrepancy between the reference in Section I, Paragraph 4, to the question of apossible moratorium, and the reference to the same question in Section III, Paragraph 39,The Cabinet were informed that the matter had beendiscussed at the Cabinet Committee:    that the twopassages were intended for the Ambassador^ personalguidance and not for publication:    and that Sir RonaldLindsay fully understood the position.   It had notbeen thought necessary to amend them.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Memoranda subject tothe following alterationsPage 4, Line 3:    Omit the following words:&quot;and consequently a second sessionpossibly in some other locality neednot be ruled out&quot;.Page 5^ Paragraph 5: Add the following words:    &quot;but nothing is more certainthan that the Lausanne settlementrepresents the maximum that can beobtained from Germany&quot;.Page 131 Paragraph 39:    Between this para-graph and the previous paragraphinsert a space of approximately one inch.Paragraph. 39, Line 14:    Before the word&quot;suggest&quot; insert &quot;if necessary&quot;.Line 18: After the last word inthe line, &quot;and&quot;, insert the words&quot;in the absence of prior agreement as to Debts %(OWhitehall Gardenst S.W.I.;February 13, 1953.Line 19:  Omit the word &quot;therefore&quot;.(MOTE: A copy of CP.-28 (33) Revise,which was before the Cabinet,as well as a copy of the Memorandafor Instructions as approved bythe Cabinet, are on the standard file of Cabinet Minutes.)(b) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the President of the Boardof Trade should examine the Memorandafor Instructions as approved by theCabinet, and edit them into the formof actual Instructions for the Ambassadorwhich could eventually be published, ifnecessity should arise, without detriment to the public interest:(c) That, as regards the Dominions, theSecretary of State for Dominion affairs should at once arrange a Meeting of high Commissioners at which he could,as a matter of courtesy, make a verbalcommunication of a general character. to the effect that the Cabinet hadderived the impression from His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington that it might bedifficult to obtain a settlement of thequestion of War Debts .    If this couldnot be achieved it might perhaps prove possible to obtain a moratorium.    If anychange in the situation should result from the Ambassador&apos;s  forthcoming inter-views with Mr Roosevelt, a further communication would be made.(NOTE: see also the footnote to the preceding Minute.)

General.II. Settlement of the War Debt to the United States of America.-Memorandum by the Treasury.III. Economic Problems. Memorandum by the Treasury, covering aStatement of Economic Policy for Sir R. Lindsay&apos;s use.1. General.1. HIS Majesty&apos;s Government by their message of the 24th January have said that they are happy to accept the invitation of Mr. Roosevelt indicating that he would like to receive &quot; a representative or representatives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at Washington as soon as possible after the 4th March.&quot; We know from Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;s full account of his conversation with Mr. Rooseveltat Warm Springs on the 29th January, that he then expressed the hope that theBritish &apos;&apos; Number 2 man &apos;&apos; might be ready to do business with him there by the6tb March and that &apos;&apos; in ten days or so sufficient progress will have been achievedfor the Prime Minister to come out in person and finish matters off.&quot; It is obvioustherefore that one of the first matters on which Mr. Roosevelt will expect to beinformed by Sir Ronald Lindsay when they meet on the 20th February is whetherthis programme, as regards both time-table and personnel, is approved. other documents are being prepared by way of instructions to the Ambassador as tothe language and arguments he should employ on war debts and various othertopics which have been mentioned to him by Mr. Roosevelt. The present memorandum is limited to suggestions as to how the proposals in point ofprocedure should be handled.2. Sir Ronald Lindsay has three tasks to perform, as the result of his visit to London, when he sees Mr. Roosevelt:  First, it will be his duty to convey to the President-Elect the warm satisfied ac-tion of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the comprehensiveness of Mr. Roosevelfsprogramme.  In addition to settling the debt question, Mr. Roosevelt contemplatesthe active co-operation of the United States with us in seeking solutions for a[8203] BSECRET.CP. 28 (33).(Revise.)
wide range of current world problems and His Majesty&apos;s Government entirelyshare his views as to their essential interdependence. As the Report of theCommission of Experts prepared for the World Monetary and EconomicConference declares (page 7 of the Draft Annotated Agenda) : &quot; It is essentialthat the problem of inter-Governmental indebtedness should be settled and that settlement should relieve the world of further anxiety concerning the disturbingeffects of such payments upon financial, economic and currency stability. until there is such a settlement, or the definite prospect of such a settlement, thesedebts will remain an insuperable barrier to economic and financial reconstruction.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government agree with Mr. Roosevelt that a comprehensivetreatment of a wide range of problems is necessary if real progress is to be made and real solutions reached. And they look forward with lively satisfaction tothe prospects of Anglo-American co-operation for the good, not only of the twocountries, but of the whole world.Secondly, as regards the specific problem of debts, the Ambassador should speak with complete candour as to the clear impressions which he has derivedfrom his visit to England of the attitude, not only of His Majesty&apos;s Government,but of British public opinion as a whole on the debt question. The elaboratematerial as to this will of course be in his hands in another memorandum. Thisreally involves not only disabusing Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s mind of his first idea thatthe debt problem can be solved on the lines he has indicated, but also settingbefore him the essential limitations which govern the possibility of a settlementiby agreement. In this connection, he will of course emphasise that, without:seeking in any way to treat the United States as a partner in the LausanneAgreemenls, it is none the less an essential of British policy, notin the interests of the United Kingdom alone, but in the interestsof world recovery as a whole, that the arrangement reached with america on debts should not conflict with or put in jeopardy the LausanneAgreements. Lausanne is the European contribution to world recovery, and, asthe Preparatory Commission of Experts to the World Conference indicated intheir report (page 6) the Lausanne Agreement is in the nature of an armistice,which cannot be sacrificed and must become the basis of permanent European peace. The Ambassador should make it entirely clear that no amount of argumentor pressure could alter this fundamental condition. And he should point outthat this is not merely the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, fromwhich they could not depart, but it would be entirely impossible to persuade theBritish House of Commons notwithstanding the Governments majority to endorseany other course. No doubt Mr. Roosevelt at present is not completely familiar with the Lausanne settlement and it will be necessary to point out to him inexplicit terms that inasmuch as the maximum possible German payment amountsto only 715 million dollars the total European payment to America would haveto be reached in relation to this limitation upon the source from which Europecan draw.Thirdly, after the above two topics have been sufficiently developed,Sir Ronald Lindsay should tell Mr. Roosevelt that the British Cabinet desire toput these matters most frankly before him for his confidential information and consideration, since the utility of the proposed visit of a British representative and the character of the representative chosen are necessarily affected by theprospects which these considerations permit to emerge. Being in the heartiestand most sympathetic agreement with the President-Elect in his conception ofthe work which the United States and Britain must undertake hand in hand for world recovery, we agree to embrace every practical opportunity of preparing totake part. At the same time, since the part of the problem which is represented,by debt settlement is envisaged by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the way aboveindicated, and since this necessarily involves some reconsideration of the possible basis of useful discussion, His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound, after explainingfrankly their own position, to enquire of Mr. Roosevelt how far he considers thatthis affects his suggested programme. Sir Ronald Lindsay, if he is able to see Mr. Roosevelt on the 20th February and following days, will be able to communi-cate Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s reactions in time for a decision to be taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, say, in the early days of March, as to the best way in which to takeAdvantage of the opportunity of a personal exchange of views at Washington.
3. It may be assumed that in the course of the conversation between the ambassador and Mr. Roosevelt the latter will be anxious for any indications asto the provisional intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to time-table andselection of a representative if Mr. Roosevelt continues to encourage the projectedvisit. As to this, the Ambassador will make it quite plain that His Ma.jesty&apos;sGovernment have not reached a decision and will not do so until they learn ofMr. Roosevelt&apos;s reaction. Before deciding to send over a Cabinet representative,His Majesty&apos;s Government would naturally require to be satisfied on certain points. They see the advantages of sending over a Cabinet representative,provided that (a) there is a real prospect of the ensuing conversations justifyingthe use of an envoy of this degree of authority, and (b) they cotdd be adequatelysecured against the set-back which might result if the Mission was regarded orrepresented as ending in failure because it did not end in agreement. NeitherMr. Roosevelt nor His Majesty&apos;s Government must be let down over the excursion.Consequently, it must be made clear from the start that such a visit is for thepurpose of exchanging views and preparing the ground. If a British Ministervisited America, it would be for the purpose of establishing direct contact withthe President-elect, and of having a preliminary discussion with him; indeed, itis obvious that a ten days&apos; visit could not possibly furnish the time for final agreement over matters covering so wide a field.4. As long as the President gains a clear impression that His Majesty&apos;s;Government, though sympathetic, has reached no decision, not even a provisionalone, to send a Ministerial spokesman, it would be legitimate and useful to leadMr. Roosevelt to consider, in general terms, what might possibly be the course and trend of discussion if, in the light of the new information as to His Majesty&apos;governments attitude, he still encourages the idea that a Cabinet minister should go over. In this connection the Ambassador should say that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are disposed to think that the relation of these debt discussions tothe World Economic Conference will require very close attention. It is for this very reason that they share Mr. roosevelt&apos;s idea that any preliminary exchange of views should cover a wide range of subjects. His Majesty&apos;s Government havealready made it clear (in their acceptance of the 24th January) that decisions&quot; on matters which constitute the subject of the World Economic Conference andwhich affect other States cannot be reached before discussions take place at that conference.&quot; But they at the same time indicated that they would be &quot; glad totake the opportunity of exchanging views with Mr. Roosevelt on these and othermatters in which the two Governments are so closely interested.&quot; If, therefore,the exchange of views on the debt problem, while clarifying and narrowing the issues, does not provide as promptly as could be wished the materials for an agreed solution of the European debt question, it may turn out that further work onthis subject has to be undertaken side by side with, though not necessarily as partof, the meetings of the World Economic Conference. This may lead to the mention of a moratorium, but we should prefer such mention to come fromMr. Roosevelt rather than it should be suggested to him at this stage.5. What follows in this paragraph is intended for Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;sguidance and confidential information, but not for communication to Mr.Roosevelt, save so far as Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s own comments appear to make someguarded reference necessary. It is to be remembered that the place of meeting ofthe World Economic Conference has been definitely fixed, ever since last december, as being London, and that the British Prime Minister was last monthunanimously nominated to be its President (the proposal of the organising committee was made by France and seconded by the United States). Elaboratepreparations are already in course of being made for the reception in London ofthe very large number of representatives and experts involved. It is, however,conceivable that Mr. Roosevelt may feel that the prospect of a transfer of debtdiscussions to London would have disadvantages from the point of view of prestige and American psychology. If he hints that the coincidence of debt and1economic discussions rather suggests to him the possibility of the transfer of the^World Economic Conference to America, Sir R. Lindsay should know that in th.&amp;view of His Majesty&apos;s Government the presidency of the British Prime Minister,which has been arranged by the League of Nations, could not be disturbed andHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be most unwilling to countenance the with -drawal of British leadership at the World Economic Conference. It is, of course..[8203] B 2
possible that though the Conference begins in London with an immense assemblageof States, it will not dispose of all its varied programme in one continuoussession. If there is an interval between its first and second sessions,further discussion of debt settlement, possibly in some other locality, mightnevertheless proceed during that interval. We apprehend that the climate of washington would in any case be quite unsuitable for such a Conference inmidsummer, and the pressure to hold the World Economic Conference as early as is practicable comes from many quarters. Indeed, if it were delayedindefinitely we might expect sharp criticisms from independent members of theHouse of Commons and from newspaper comment, but Sir Ronald Lindsay shouldnot reject modifications of the programme of the World Economic Conference asimpossible if the President-Elect seems to be thinking along these lines. the ambassador will, of course, exercise great caution in encouraging any changes inthe arrangements for the World Conference, and the matter would have to be left open for report to London when Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s mature reflections on the subject had become available.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that in view of the complication of thematters to be discussed at the World Economic Conference, and the importanceof letting their treatment follow the course which at the time gives the best prospect for co-operation, it will be very necessary that the inaugural declarationof the incoming President should not limit the freedom of action which heeventually intends to claim and to exercise. We feel sure that this is also Mr.Roosevelt&apos;s view, and we hope that the Ambassador will take advantage of any opportunity that may offer for bringing this point to Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s notice. Anyfurther information which he may care to request so that he may frame his address with the results he desires will, of course, be most readily forthcoming.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government have succeeded in preventing any informationwhatever reaching the press as to the contents of Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s previousconversation with the Ambassador, and the whole matter has been kept withinthe strictest and smallest circle of confidants. His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose to follow the same course about the impending interview between the ambassador and Mr. Roosevelt, and are convinced that the best prospect of useful negotiation will be secured if nothing is announced from either Govern-ment until the results of these February consultations have matured in a definitearrangement as to the date and nature of the proposed visit.February 10, 1933.II. Settlement of the &quot;War Debt to the United States of America.Memorandum by the Treasury.1. There are two conditions which require to be fulfilled by any settlement which may be reached with regard to the War Debt to the United States ofAmerica, viz. : (a) that the settlement shall not be such as to involve a reopening of the lausanne Agreement; and(b) that any future payments by the United Kingdom shall not be more than can be covered by our receipts from our own debtors.- The Lausanne Settlement.2. Throughout the post-war period the question of Reparations has been a constant menace to European peace and stability. The settlement of 1921 broke down and led to the occupation of the Ruhr and to the collapse of the mark. the dawes Plan which followed was maintained for five years but then had to bereplaced by the Young Plan, which in turn broke down, and only as the result of
the Hoover moratorium was an immediate crisis averted. On each occasion the liabilities of Germany have been scaled down, but none of these settlements werefinal. Only after prolonged and difficult negotiations was it possible at Lausanneto reach an agreement accepted by all the different Governments concerned as reasonable.But the Lausanne Agreement represents far more than the settlement of theReparation question. It represents also a great political effort to obliterate theanimosities engendered by the war and to restore an atmosphere of peaceful co-operation in Europe. As stated in the Declaration embodied in the Agreement,the signatory Powers had &quot; the firm intention of helping to create a new order,permitting the establishment and development of confidence between the nations in a mutual spirit of reconciliation, collaboration and justice.&quot; If this settlement where not to be ratified, the political reactions, both in Germany and between germany and the rest of Europe, could not be foreseen.On the economic side Lausanne was equally important. The FinancialCrisis of 1931 led. to the collapse of credit and confidence and sapped commercialenterprise and initiative. As soon as the Lausanne Agreement was signed, therewas a marked, though short-lived, revival of confidence which led to an upward trend of both commodity prices and security prices. His Majesty&apos;s government believe that the final ratification of the Lausanne Agreement will lead to a real and permanent revival of confidence: on the other hand, if the reparationsquestion were to be reopened, confidence throughout the world would be furtherundermined and the fall in prices and economic distress of the world would beaccentuated.The financial effect of the Lausanne Agreement was to provide that all the creditor Powers of Germany should receive 5 per cent. Bonds for 3 milliards ofReichsmarks (equivalent to 715 million dollars, or  210 million at present ratesof exchange*), such Bonds not to be marketed for three years, and thereafter only if and when German credit was so completely restored as to enable them to beissued at close on par. Thus the maximum German payment represents an annualcharge for 50 years of, say, 39 million dollars ( 11-! million), of which the british share would under existing Agreements be about one-fifth, less than  2^ million per annum.British claims on Europe.3. The pre-Lausanne claims of Great Britain in respect of allied debts and reparations amounted nominally to  48 million sterling a year, viz.. Allied debts 18 million payable in sterling and German reparations under the Young Plan 21 million payable in gold (equivalent to, say,  30 million sterling at present rates of exchange). The British claims on their European Allies were based onthe debtors&apos; credit alone, and this was made clear throughout the war debtnegotiations with them. But under the Young Plan the payments to be made toGreat Britain by her debtors were to be recovered by the latter as part of their-own reparation receipts from Germany. The European debtor Powers will almost certainly maintain that they can only reduce their claims on Germany, as-proposed at Lausanne, if His Majesty&apos;s Government do not claim additional payments from them on their own credit. If, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment try to recover their war debt claims from France and Italy, these latterPowers will either appeal to the Lausanne settlement and refuse to pay anything more than they receive under that settlement, or they will refuse to redily the lausanne settlement and claim from Germany whatever is asked from them either by the United Kingdom or by the United States of America. In the latter eventthey are not likely to make effective payments unless they succeed in obtaining thenecessary sums from Germany. But nothing is more certain than that the lausanne settlement represents the maximum sum that can be obtained fromGermany. -4. The only solution consistent with the Lausanne Agreement would there-fore be that the United States of America should accept from the whole of itsEuropean Debtors sums equivalent to the eventual proceeds of the Lausanne.Bondb, viz., not exceeding 715 million dollars capital, or fifty annuities of439 million dollars.* Exchange rate taken throughout, $8*40 =  1.
Effect of Reducing Interest Charges to &quot;Italian Terms.&quot;5. It has been suggested that the President-Elect may be prepared to contemplate a reduction of future payments by the United Kingdom government by reducing interest charges, both past and future, to a nominal figure, or bywaiving them altogether.As an example of reduction of interest to a more or less nominal figure, theapplication of &apos;&apos; Italian terms &apos;&apos; to the British debt might be considered.The Italian debt to the United States of America was settled on termsproviding for no interest to be charged until 1930, and thereafter interest to becharged at rates rising from one-eighth of 1 per cent, for the years 1930-40 to2 per cent, for the years 1980--87.These rates are equivalent to an average interest rate of 0-4 per cent., andif future payments by the United Kingdom to the United States of America werescaled down to this basis we should, if a flat annuity were fixed, have to pay(at the present rate of exchange)  28 million a year for fifty years. Alternatively,a rising scale of annuities calculated on Italian terms would involve paymentsrising from  9f million in 1934 to  14f million in 1944,  21^ million in 1954, 29 million in 1964,  38 million in 1974, and  50 million in 1984.There is clearly no possibility of settling on this basis, without wrecking the lausanne Agreement.Nor could an acceptable basis be found by making the offer retrospective.If we were granted &quot; Italian terms &quot; from the outset and were given credit forthe excess payments already made, we should still have to pay on a scale rising from  7 million in 1934&apos; to  10f million in 1944,  I5f million in 1954, 27f million in 1974 and  37f million in 1987, or alternatively a flat fifty-yearannuity of  18 million a year.Effect of Waiving all Interest Charges.6. The effect of waiving all interest charges, past and future, would be as.follows : The aggregate capital of the European War Debts due to the United Statesof America by the Creditor Powers of Germany as funded was about 11,000million dollars. This, however, included a considerable amount of interest whichwas funded, and if all interest is excluded from the date of the original advances,the total would be reduced to 9,810 million dollars. As against this total, thepayments already made under the Funding Agreements (mainly for interest)amount to 1,720 million dollars. If all these payments are treated as repayments of capital, the amount now outstanding is 8,090 million dollars. To repay this in fifty years without interest requires fifty annuities of 162 million dollars ascompared with the maximum of 39 million dollars a year that is equivalent towhat Germany may be required to pay under the Lausanne Agreement. Thuseven if all interest, past and future, were to be waived the debtors of america would still remain liable for payments to the United States of America equivalentto 4^ times the maximum amount which could be received by them under the lausanne Agreement.7 Even therefore if all interest, both before and after funding, were entirely eliminated, the &apos;&apos; all-round &apos;&apos; settlement could only be obtained if theburden on Germany were increased over fourfold and made definite instead ofcontingent.   This is clearly impossible.Further Possible Reductions.8. It will therefore be necessary not only to eliminate all interest, whether before or after funding, but also to secure a further substantial reduction of theelaims of the United States of America if those claims are to be brought down toa figure which can be reconciled with the Lausanne settlement.9. One argument which might be used is that the British debt obligationsshould be further scaled down in proportion to the depreciation of sterling, whichhas greatly affected the burden of the British debt. But this argument wouldnot apply to the Continental Powers, whose position also has to be considered ifa general settlement is to be reached.
10. An alternative procedure would be to reduce the capital debt in proportion to the fall in world prices. It is well known that the bulk of thewar debts were incurred in the purchase of commodities at the inflated price-levels ruling towards the end of the War. Prices have since fallen by approximately one-half; thus repayment at the original price involves doubling the liability in terms of present-day value of goods.In this event, of course, the repayments already made, as well as the originalcapital debt, would have to be adjusted in accordance with the price level at the relevant dates.   This has been done in the calculations which follow : Settlement on the basis of (1) No interest; and (2) Allowance for thefall in prices.In the case of the United Kingdom  Million million dollars. dollars.The Capital Debt of   ...          ... ... 4,277is scaled down to ...          ... ... ... 1,972The repayments of      ...          ... ... 1.447are scaled down to...          .... ... ... 1,067Leaving a net debt of       ____ ... 905In the other cases (added together) The Capital Debts of ... ... 5,533are scaled down to... ... ... ...             2,840The repayments of      ... ... ... 273are scaled down to... ... ... ...                 182Leaving a net debt of ... ... 2.658Assuming that, repayment without interest is spread over fifty years, the.-annuities due by each Power would be  million dollars.The United Kingdom        ... ... 18   ( 5-*- million)France    ... ... ... ... 29Italy       ... ... ... ... 18Belgium and Minor Powers... ... 67111. Even this figure is very considerably more than the maximum receivablefrom Germany viz. : 39 million dollars and some further adjustment would still be required. How such an adjustment could be obtained is a matter forfurther discussion, but at least, in view of the disproportionate amounts already paid by Great Britain, as compared with the other debtors, it is clear that nofurther burden should be imposed on this country in connection therewith.12. Assuming that some acceptable scheme could be evolved, the most satisfactory plan would be for Great Britain to forego future receipts from europe and be absolved from future payments to the United States of America,and to leave the United States of America to settle with France, Italy, &amp;c, onthe basis of the payments to be made by Germany under the Lausanne Agreement.Such an arrangement would not of course mean that, over the whole period,the British receipts from reparations and allied war debts have covered thepayments made in respect of the British War Debt to America. On the contrary,before the Hoover Moratorium, the aggregate British payments had amountedto  326 million, against aggregate receipts from reparations (including deliveries in kind, &amp;e.), and allied war debts of  192 million, leaving a deficit or 134 million. If interest at 5 per cent, is added to both sides of the account, the deficit would be about  200 million; and this deficit has since been increased bythe payment of  30 million sterling made on the 15th December, 1932. Thus,the United Kingdom borrowed from the United States  850 million; she herselflent to the Allies  1,600 million, and had large claims on Germany for repara-
tions. She has, in fact, paid on her debt to the United States all that she hasreceived from reparations and War Loans together (viz.,  192 million), and overand above that a further  164 million capital, excluding interest.. 13. Alternatively, revised settlements might be made between the UnitedStates of America and each of its debtors within the limits of their respectiveshares of the Lausanne payments, each debtor power being responsible for its share of the total payments to be made.(Such payments to the United States of America would, of course, be conditional on equivalent payments being forthcoming from Germany.)14. The fact is that the United States of America and the United kingdom are co-creditors of a bankrupt world, and a settlement has to be reached betweenthem on the basis of what can be recovered from their joint debtors. If theUnited States Government are not prepared to reach a settlement with HisMajesty&apos;s Government on this basis, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be facedwith the choice between two alternatives: either to maintain the LausanneAgreement in Europe and suspend payments to America pending the negotiation of a general settlement on the basis of that Agreement, or to make the paymentsrequired by the United States of America, but at the same time to recover any payments thus made from their debtors in Europe, with incalculable consequenceson European financial and political stability. It will be quite impossible for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to contemplate a continuance of payments by them to theUnited States without recovery from their own debtors in Europe; and it isequally impossible for them to contemplate a breakdown of the Lausanne settle-ment. In these circumstances, if an impasse is to be avoided, they can onlysuggest that the United States Government should agree to a moratorium of war debt payments pending a general discussion with all the signatories of the lausanne Agreement as to the best means of arriving at a settlement of the wholequestion, which would satisfy the requirements of the United States withoutundermining the efforts at reconstruction made by the European Powers.III. Economic Problems.Memorandum by the Treasury covering a Statement of Economic Policy for sir R. Lindsay&apos;s use. N15. It has been suggested that the United States President may find itdifficult to present a debt settlement to Congress unless, in appearance at least,it is accompanied by concessions on the part of Great Britain. We have as yet no clear idea what concessions may be proposed, and in all probability theAmerican ideas are still in a very fluid state. Vague references have been madeto concessions on disarmament, but it seems almost certain that as discussionsdevelop the tendency will be to concentrate on (a) The return of Great Britain and other countries to the gold standard;Lb) Commercial concessions by Great Britain to the United States;( /Measures, especially by the Government of India, to increase the price of silver.16. The restoration of an international monetary standard (afterappropriate conditions have been fulfilled), the freeing of international commerceby moderating tariffs and by abolishing quota and exchange restrictions, and thespecial position of silver were all discussed at the recent meeting at Geneva of thePreparatory Committee for the World Conference. Some progress was made inlaying down principles which were acceptable to the United States experts aswell as to ourselves, and on many points the views of the United States andBritish experts were more closely in accord than those of other countries. . But itshould be borne in mind that the United States experts were not Governmentalrepresentatives.17. The recommendations of the Preparatory Committee can only be implemented as a result of real co-operation by all the principal countries of theworld.   Agreement between the United States, Great Britain and France is, -in
any case, indispensable. Nevertheless, a preliminary survey of the agenda inconsultation with the United States Government is exactly what we should have wished for in ordinary circumstances. We should also desire similar consulta-tions with the French and some other Governments before the Conference meets..18. But the whole position is complicated by the dispute on war debts.Whereas we most heartily desire to co-operate with the United States Govern-ment on the questions arising out of the Agenda, the whole position is distortedif such consultation is represented as meaning concessions, to our detriment andto the advantage of the United States, intended as a quid pro quo to a reductionof war debts.19. In our opinion, what we should aim at is an agreed programme of&quot;co-operation between us and the United States with a view to saving our twocountries and the world at large from disaster.20. The draft statement of British Policy on economic problems containedin paragraphs 24 to 38 below has been prepared with a view to indicatingwhat could be said to the United States Government. If it is read closelyit will be apparent how little there is which could plausibly be represented as a quid pro quo for debt reduction. A very early return of Great Britain tothe gold standard is much the more important object in the eyes of the UnitedStates, though they have long since abandoned any hope that we shall return atthe old par. We also envisage a return to the gold standard, but the essential difference between our viewpoint and that of the United States is that they regard the return of Great Britain to gold as a first step to world recovery from whichall other results are to flow, whereas we envisage our return to gold as the culmination of a long process of reform and reconstruction in world conditions.21. It would be injudicious on our part to introduce the question of temporary stabilisation of sterling, though no doubt the Americans may raise it-While we could indicate our strong desire to limit fluctuations in exchange due topurely speculative influences, it is certain that we should not satisfy them onthis point either.22. As regards Anglo-American tariff discussions, our exports of domesticproducts to the United States in 1932 were only  15 million and it is obviouslya question of asking for concessions from them rather than making concessionsourselves.23. As regards silver which is much more a matter for the Indian Govern-ment than for ourselves, certain promises of co-operation might possibly be made;but in reality the demand of the United States silver producers is that the indian and other Governments shall be prohibited from selling surplus silver in orderthat silver producers may increase their own production. It is certain that theIndian Government could not be expected to entertain so one-sided an arrange-ment (see paragraph 35).STATEMENT OF BRITISH POLICY ON ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.24. His Majesty&apos;s Government warmly welcome the suggestion of thePresident-Elect that concurrently with the discussion of War Debts there shouldbe a discussion of World Economic problems in which the two Governments. aremutually interested. It is a matter of vital moment to the peoples Of the UnitedKingdom, as it is to the people of the United States of America, to counteract the present world depression, to relieve the constant pressure of unemployment,to restore the level of prices and to revive prosperity. It becomes more and moreclear that the operation of normal economic forces cannot be relied upon to bring this about in any reasonable period and that positive action by Governments is called for to expedite it. But in fact the efforts made by each Government up tothe present time have been singularly ineffective and there is growing impatienceon the part of the ordinary man and woman in all countries at the apparentinability of their Government to master the blind forces which seem to be working[8203] c   &apos; :
relentlessly to a general breakdown of the financial, economic and social structure of society. The fact is that the depression cannot be effectively remedied byisolated action on the part of individual Governments : it is essentially inter-national in its character and requires for its solution international action on avery broad front. It will therefore be necessary to secure concerted measures onthe part of all the principal countries of the world and the World Monetary andEconomic Conference offers an opportunity for devising such measures. But itwould greatly help towards success in that Conference if the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the United States President were similar towards the objectives to be promoted at the Conference, and His Majesty&apos;s Government fortheir part will gladly enter into an exchange of views to this end.25. The Report and Agenda for the World Conference, recently elaboratedby the Preparatory Commission of experts appointed by the League of Nations,affords a useful basis for this discussion. The Report of the Commission, acceptedunanimously by eminent experts of seventeen different countries, including all theprincipal countries of Europe, the United States of America, the Argentine,China and India, as well as by representatives of the Bank for international settlements and other international institutions, sets out in a clear and conciseform the actual position and the programme which the Governments have to face,followed by an annotated agenda summarising the detailed issues involved.Taking this programme as the basis. His Majesty&apos;s Government propose toindicate the general lines on which they would envisage co-operation between theUnited States of America and the United Kingdom in promoting a solution of theworld economic problems:Rise in the Level of Prices.26. It is accepted in all quarters that an increase in the general level of world prices and, more particularly, in the prices of farm commodities is highly desirable. His Majesty&apos;s Government are in entire agreement with thisview and have repeatedly declared that it is one of the main objects of their policy to secure a rise in wholesale prices, especially in the wholesale prices of foodstuffs and raw materials, not only in Great Britain but throughout the world. Whilethe export trade of Gr*eat Britain is mainly in manfactured goods, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are convinced that no real prosperity can be secured by the manu-facturing interests until the primary producers in all countries are once more ina position to recommence normal purchases.A vivid sketch of the existing price situation is given in the introduction tothe Report of the Preparatory Commission. Wholesale commodity prices ingeneral have fallen by over one-third since October 1929, while raw material prices have dropped by from 50 to 60 per cent, since that date. The remedial measures which appeared to the Preparatory Commission to deserve considerationare mentioned on page 8 of the Agenda,, while a fuller analysis is given on pages 18 to 20.27. Monetary action is, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, necessaryto secure a rise in prices. It is a question whether monetary action is sufficientby itself to raise prices without long delay, which the condition of the worldhardly permits, but that does not alter the fact that monetary action is necessaryto create the conditions in which a price rise can take place. His. Majesty&apos;sGovernment believe that many valuable results have been achieved by themeasures taken both in the United States of America and in London to ensurethe provision of cheap and abundant short-term money, but on the other hand, theyare convinced that well co-ordinated action between the leading Central Banksis likely to have more effect in improving world conditions than isolated effortsby particular countries. His Majesty&apos;s Government would be happy to co-operate in any measures which the United States Government might think well designedto secure this object.28. Monetary action, however, operates only to increase the supply of credit, and simultaneous action is required to increase the demand. Monetarvaction would require to be supplemented therefore by action to restore the purchasing power of debtor countries, to promote international trade and in somecases to regulate production. All these interconnected problems are dealt with inthe Agenda and must receive detailed consideration at the World Economic
Conference. The concerted action of many countries is required for success, but,,as already indicated, His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that , a preliminary survey by the two Governments would be most helpful.Stabilisation of Currencies.29. Among the difficulties confronting international trade a prominentplace must be assigned to currency disorganisation. The world crisis whichcommenced in the Autumn of 1929 has now lasted for more than three years.For the first two years of that period practically the whole world remained on thegold standard. But the continued disastrous fall in prices and the steady and rapid diminution in trade made currency breakdown inevitable. With the inter-national economic system in course of rapid destruction it was impossible that aninternational currency system should survive. Very few countries now retainfree gold standard currency systems. A large number have remained nominallyattached to gold, but only by imposing restrictions which are destructive of tradeand financial intercourse between nations. Other countries have abandoned thegold standard.30. A general return to an international monetary standard would be welcomed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but they fear that this will not be apractical possibility until some degree of health has been restored to the inter-national economic system. The experience of the first two years of the crisisindicated the defective conditions under which the international monetarystandard then worked, while the struggle of so many countries to remain attachedto that standard by the adoption of deflationary measures and by placing growingrestrictions on trade was a powerful factor in accelerating the collapse. Ageneral return to the gold standard, so long as that is only possible by deflationarymeasures or by imposing fresh restrictions on trade could but do harm.On the other hand, provided that a reasonable degree of equilibrium betweenprices and costs can be restored and the defects which have shown themselves inthe working of the Gold Standard are removed by suitable international co--operation, His Majesty&apos;s Government, as at present advised, see no reason whythe way should not be open to the re-establishment of an international system.Exchange Controls.31. The Exchange controls recently imposed by many countries and the clearing and compensation agreements to which they have given rise, have proved a most serious obstacle to international trade. His Majesty&apos;s Government would gladly co-operate with the Government of the United States in pressing.for theabolition of all such measures. It must be recognised, however, that&apos;many of thecountries which have adopted these controls will plead their inability to removethem, unless they are first assured against a collapse of their currencies by theprovision of additional foreign exchange reserves or by the readjustment of theirexternal commercial debts. The United Kingdom and the United States ,ofAmerica have in the past been the largest international capital markets, andthey have common interests in securing that these difficulties are wisely dealtwith. Owing to the collapse of confidence, it is hardly to be expected that the flow of international capital can be resumed in the near future through theordinary market channels, and it may be necessary to contemplate special measures(such as have been set on foot in the United States for internal purposes) tofacilitate the revival of international credit. Any such action would largely depend on the possibility of securing co-operation between Central Banks, witha view to putting into circulation resources which are at present immobilised,;and the precise method by which this could best be done would require careful investigation by the financial authorities of the principal creditor countries.His Majesty&apos;s Government would willingly associate themselves with the UnitedStates Government in furthering such an investigation, as it appears to themthat a restoration of world prices must depend in a large measure on thepossibility of restoring the purchasing power, of the debtor countries, whether in Europe or overseas.Relaxation of Trade Barriers.32. The Preparatory Commission points out that one of the most significantfeatures of the present crisis .is the. fall which has taken place not only in the- [8203]    - &apos; &apos;&apos; &apos; n
value but in the quantum ot international trade. Apart from exchange controls,the principal reason for this fall seems to be the growing network of quantitative restrictions on international trade in the form of prohibitions and quotas on imports which have recently been imposed.These restrictions on imports have proved a far greater obstacle to inter-national trade than any tariffs, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would gladlyco-operate with the United States Government in pressing for a general agreement,with a view to their relaxation and their abolition as soon as possible, particularly as regards manufactures. As regards farm products, and particularly meat anddairy products, exceptional measures may be required to cope with the presentglut, and the possibility of relaxation will depend largely on the possibility of ensuring a better regulation of production (see paragraph 36 below).Tariffs.33. His Majesty&apos;s Government would also favour a general agreement forthe reduction of tariffs and for the maintenance of a more moderate tariff policyin the future. They have in the past supported the most unconditional interpre-tation of the most-favoured-nation clause, and their existing treaty obligationsrender it difficult for them to accept proposals which might conflict with most-favoured-nation rights. They would, however, be ready to consider co-operationwith the United States with a view to securing (a) a general Gentleman&apos;s agreement under which no country would increase its actual tariffs above theirexisting level pending the outcome of the Conference, and lb) an arrangement for the gradual reduction of high protective tariffs to a more moderate level. Asregards any tariff truce, it must be remembered that the British tariff represents acomparatively low measure of protection and it would not be possible for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to tie their hands for an indefinite period by adoptingan arrangement which stereotypes the existing position. As regards reductionof tariffs, it must be borne in mind that the national budgets of many countriesdepend on high revenue duties on spirits, tobacco and other luxuries.Anglo-American Tariff Discussions.34. As regards direct American trade with this country, it is obvious fronithe figures that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not in a position to offer anysubstantial advantages over and above those which America already enjoys. Forthe year 1931 British imports from the United States of America amounted to 104 million, while the exports of British domestic products to the United states were  18 million; for the year 1932 British imports from America were 84 million,, and domestic exports only  15 million. There is, therefore, an enormous excess of United States exports to this country over British exportsto the United States. As it is essential to restore equilibrium in the balance ofpayments if sterling is to be stabilised, the United, Kingdom can obviously not afford to buy larger quantities of United States goods unless the United Statesoffer greatly increased outlets for the manufactures of this country. &quot;HisMajesty&apos;s Government will, however, gladly enter into discussions, if and whenthe United, States so desire, with a view to concluding a tariff agreement on thebasis of reciprocity.Silver. &apos;&apos;35. As regards silver, the Preparatory Commission point out that such schemes as bimetallism. &amp;c. are impossible of adoption, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment assume that the United States concur in this view. The Expertsalso agreed that what is required is not a rise in the price of silver as such(which would involve great economic difficulties for the silver-using countries,particularly China), but a rise in the general level of commodity prices whichwould bring up the value of silver at the same time. The criticism levelled againstthe Indian Government in connection with silver is largely due to misapprehen-sion. The Government of India has made no radical alteration in its currencysystem during the last forty years, but it has been greatly embarrassed by thesurplus silver flowing into its reserves following upon the fall in commodity prices. It would not be possible for the Government of India to agree to restrictsales of silver from these reserves while there was no similar restriction oil salesby the silver producers. It may be pointed out that in fact, on balance, over thelast few years the Government of India has increased, hot decreased, the stocksof silver held in its reserves.   The most that could be said on this subject is that
the Government of India have expressed their readiness to discuss an arrange-ment with the silver producers with a view to some general regulation of sales of silver.Regulation of Production.36. . While the regulation of production has many critics, it appears to Hi ;Majesty&apos;s Government that some measure of this kind may be justified and helpful in the case of certain primary materials, especially where large stocks are over-hanging the market. Regulation schemes are already in existence for sugar and tin, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are proposing to call a Conference inorder to secure an agreement for the regulation of production in the meat trade.They are also contemplating further agreements in respect of dairy produce.As regards wheat, His Majesty&apos;s Government are not directly interested, asthe United Kingdom is an importing country, but they agree that the EconomicConference should consider the possibility of an international agreement betweenthe main producing countries for a restriction of acreage in those countriescoupled with a reduction in the excessive tariffs on wheat now imposed in someof the more important consuming countries.37. In this connection His Majesty&apos;s Government would like to point outthe particular interest which they have in seeking to put the shipping industry on a more economic basis. At the present time the subsidies to snipping givenby many countries has led to the construction and the working of a much greatertonnage than is required by existing international trade, so that in many countriesshipping has become a burden on the national economy, instead of a contributionto its prosperity. They will welcome the co-operation of the United StatesGovernment in securing a remedy for this situation.38. His Majesty&apos;s Government have here outlined the objectives which theywould aim at securing by the World Economic Conference, and they trust thatthe Government of the United States will find it possible to support similarobjectives. But it is essential to stress throughout that any hope of arriving atbetter conditions is dependent on a satisfactory settlement of the War Debtsquestion having been reached, or at least assured. The existence of these debtsconstitutes, as the Preparatory Commission have said, an insuperable barrier to continue and financial reconstruction, and there is no prospect of the world economic Conference making progress if this barrier cannot be removed.39. The above review of the situation shows that a settlement both of war debts and of the other economic problems necessarily entails international co--operation, not only between the United States and the United Kingdom, butbetween all the principal countries of the world. The difficulties of making progress on any one problem are very great, but the Governments would not beforgiven by their peoples if they failed to make the most resolute efforts to arriveat solutions in the common interest. His Majesty&apos;s Government would greatlyprefer a settlement to be reached of War Debts in the first instance, as this is aquestion which is under the immediate control of certain Governments, and they believe that its settlement would very greatly promote progress on the widereconomic questions. But if a settlement satisfactory to both Governments is atpresent unattainable, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to discussall the factors of the present world crisis, including war debts, concurrently. Inthat event they would, if necessary, suggest that the discussion of war debtsshould be postponed until the World Economic Conference is held, and that itshould be carried on concurrently with that Conference. In the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government it would be essential if the Conference is to achieve any measure of success that it should be free from the menace of a possible reopening of Reparations, and, in the absence of prior agreement as to debts, they trust that the Government of the United States of America would be able to arrangefor the suspension of all War Debt payments until the deliberations of theConference were concluded.February 10, 1933.

General.II. Settlement of the War. Debt to the United States of America. Memorandum by the Treasury.III. Economic Problems. Memorandum by the Treasury, covering aStatement of Economic Policy for Sir R. Lindsay&apos;s use.I. General.1. HIS Majesty&apos;s Government by their message of the 24th January have said that they are happy to accept the invitation of Mr. Roosevelt indicating that he would like to receive &quot; a representative or representatives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at Washington as soon as possible after the 4th March.&quot; We know from Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;s full account of his conversation with Mr. Rooseveltat Warm Springs on the 29th January, that he then expressed the hope that theBritish &apos;&apos; Number 2 man &apos;&apos; might be ready to do business with him there by the6th March and that &apos;&apos; in ten days or so sufficient progress will have been achievedfor the Prime Minister to come out in person and finish matters off.&quot; It is obvioustherefore that one of the first matters on which Mr. Roosevelt will expect to beinformed by Sir Ronald Lindsay when they meet on the 20th February is whetherthis programme, as regards both time-table and personnel, is approved. other documents are being prepared by way of instructions to the Ambassador as tothe language and arguments he should employ on war debts and various othertopics which have been mentioned to him by Mr. Roosevelt. The present memorandum is limited to suggestions as to how the proposals in point ofprocedure should be handled.2. Sir Ronald Lindsay has three tasks to perform, as the result of his visit to London, when he sees Mr. Roosevelt: First, it will be his duty to convey to the President-Elect the warm satisfied ac-tion of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the comprehensiveness of Mr. Roosevelt&apos;programme.  In addition to settling the debt question, Mr. Roosevelt contemplatesthe active co-operation of.the United States with us in seeking solutions for a[8203] i3&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
wide range of current world problems and His Majesty&apos;s Government entirelyshare his views as to their essential interdependence. As the Report of theCommission of Experts prepared for the World Monetary and EconomicConference declares (page 7 of the Draft Annotated Agenda) : &quot;It is. essentialthat the problem of inter-Governmental indebtedness should be settled and that,settlement should relieve the world of further anxiety concerning the disturbingeffects of such payments upon financial, economic and currency stability; until there is such a settlement, or the definite prospect of such a settlement, thesedebts will remain an insuperable barrier to economic and financial reconstruction.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government agree with Mr. Roosevelt that a comprehensivetreatment of a wide range of problems: is necessary if real progress is to be made and real solutions reached. And they look forward with lively satisfaction tothe prospects of Anglo-American co-operation for the good, not only of the twocountries, but of the whole world.Secondly, as regards the specific problem of debts, the Ambassador should speak with complete candour as to the clear impressions which he has derivedfrom his visit to England of the attitude, not only of His Majesty&apos;s Government,but of British public opinion as a whole on the debt question. The elaboratematerial as to this will of course be in his hands in another memorandum. Thisreally involves not only disabusing Mr. roosevelt&apos;s mind of his first idea thatthe debt problem can be solved on the lines he has indicated, but also settingbefore him the essential limitations which govern the possibility of a settlement by agreement. In this connection, he will of course emphasise that, without seeking in any way to treat the United States as a partner in the LausanneAgreements, it is none the less an essential of British policy, notin the interests of the United Kingdom alone, but in the interestsof world recovery as a whole, that the arrangement reached with america on debts should not conflict with or put in jeopardy the LausanneAgreements. Lausanne is the European contribution to world recovery, and, asthe Preparatory Commission of Experts to the World Conference indicated intheir report (page 6) the Lausanne Agreement is in the nature of an armistice,which cannot be sacrificed and must become the basis of permanent European peace. The Ambassador should make it entirely clear that no amount of argumentor pressure could alter this fundamental condition. And he should point outthat this is not merely the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, fromwhich they could not depart, but it would be entirely impossible to persuade theBritish House of Commons notwithstanding the Government&apos;s majority to endorseany other course. No doubt Mr. Roosevelt at present is not completely familiar with the Lausanne settlement and it will be necessary to point out to him inexplicit terms that inasmuch as the maximum possible German payment amountsto only 7J5 million dollars the total European payment to America would haveto be reached in relation to this limitation upon the source from which Europecan draw. &apos; &apos;&apos; -&quot;-- y.     -.Thirdly, after the above two topics have been sufficiently developed,Sir Ronald Lindsay should tell Mr. Roosevelt that the British Cabinet desire toput these matters most frankly before him for his confidential information and consideration, since the utility of the proposed visit of a British representative and the character of the representative chosen are necessarily affected by theprospects, which these considerations permit to emerge. Being in the heartiestand most.sympathetic agreement with the President-Elect in his conception ofthe work.which the United States and Britain must undertake hand in hand for world recovery, we agree to embrace every practical opportunity of preparing totake part. At the same time, since the part of the problem which is represented by debt settlement is envisaged by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the way aboveindicated, and.since this necessarily involves some reconsideration of the possible basis of useful discussion, His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound, after explainingfrankly their own position, to enquire of Mr. Roosevelt how far he,considers thatthis affects his suggested programme. Sir Ronald Lindsay, if he is able to see Mr. Roosevelt on the 20th February and following days, will be able to communi-cate Mr.,Roosevelt&apos;s reactions iii time for a decision to be taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, say, in the early days of March, as to the best way in which, to takeadvantage of the opportunity of a personal exchange of views at Washington.,
3. It may be assumed that in the course of the conversation between the ambassador and Mr. Roosevelt the latter will be anxious for any indications asto the provisional intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to time-table andselection of a representative if Mr. Roosevelt continues to encourage the projectedvisit. As to this, the Ambassador will make it quite plain that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, have not reached a decision and will not do so until they learn ofMr. roosevelt&apos;s reaction. Before deciding to send over a Cabinet representative,.His Majesty&apos;s Government would naturally require to be satisfied on certain points. They see the advantages of sending over a Cabinet representative,provided that (a) there is a real prospect of the ensuing conversations justifyingthe use of an envoy of this degree of authority, and, (b) they coidd be adequatelysecured against the set-back which might result if the Mission was regarded orrepresented as ending in failure because it did not end in agreement. NeitherMr. Roosevelt nor His Majesty&apos;s Government must be let down over the excursion;Consequently, it must be made clear from the start that such a visit is for thepurpose of exchanging views and preparing the ground. If a British Ministervisited America, it would be for the purpose of establishing direct contact withthe President-elect, and of having a preliminary discussion with him; indeed, itis obvious that a ten days&apos; visit could not possibly furnish the time for final agreement over matters covering so wide a field.4. As long as the President gains a clear impression that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, though sympathetic, has reached no decision, not even a provisionalone, to send a Ministerial spokesman, it would be legitimate and useful to, leadMr. Roosevelt to consider, in general terms, what might possibly be the course and trend of discussion if, in the light of the new information as to His Majesty&apos;governments attitude, he still encourages the idea that a Cabinet minister should go over. In this connection the Ambassador should say that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are disposed to think that the relation of these debt discussions tothe World Economic Conference will require very close attention. It is for this very reason that they share Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s idea that any preliminary exchange of views should cover a wide range of subjects. His Majesty&apos;s Government havealready made it clear (in their acceptance of the 24th January) that decisions&quot; on matters which constitute the subject of the World Economic Conference and.which affect other States cannot be reached before discussions take place at that conference.&quot; But they at the same time indicated that they would be &quot; glad totake the opportunity of exchanging views with Mr. Roosevelt on these and othermatters in which the two Governments are so closely interested.&quot; If, therefore,the exchange of views on the debt problem, while clarifying and narrowing the issues, does not provide as promptly as could be wished the materials for an agreed solution of the European debt question, it may turn out that further work onthis subject has to be undertaken side by side with, though not necessarily as partof, the meetings of the World Economic Conference. This may lead to the mention of a moratorium, but we should prefer such mention to come fromMr. Roosevelt rather than it should be suggested to him at this stage.5. What follows in this paragraph is intended for Sir: Ronald Lindsay&apos;sguidance and confidential information, but not for communication to Mr.Roosevelt, save so far as Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s own comments appear to make someguarded reference necessary. It is to be remembered that the place of meeting ofthe World Economic Conference has been definitely fixed, ever since last december, as being London, and that the British Prime Minister was last monthunanimously nominated to be its President (the proposal of the organising committee was made by France and seconded by the United States). Elaboratepreparations are already in course of being made for the reception in London ofthe very large number of representatives and experts involved. It is, however,,conceivable that. Mr. Roosevelt may feel that the prospect, of a transfer of debtdiscussions to London would have disadvantages from the point of view of prestige and American psychology. If he hints that the coincidence of debt arideconomic discussions rather suggests to him the possibility of the transfer, of theWorld Economic Conference to America, Sir R. Lindsay should know that in theview of His Majesty &apos;s Government the presidency of the British Prime Minister;which has been arranged by the League of Nations, could hot be disturbed andHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be most unwilling to countenance the with-drawalof British leadefship^at the World EcoMoriiic Conference. It is,&apos; of course,[8203] u 2
possible that though the Conference begins in London with an immense assemblageof States, it will not dispose of all its valued programme in one continuoussession. If there is an interval between its first and second sessions,further discussion of debt settlement, possibly in some other locality, mightnevertheless proceed during that interval; We apprehend that the climate of washington would in any case be quite unsuitable for simh a Conference inmidsummer, and the pressure to hold the World Economic Conference as early as is practicable comes from many quarters. Indeed, if it were delayedindefinitely we might expect sharp criticisms from independent members of theHouse of Commons and from newspaper comment, but Sir Ronald Lindsay shouldnot reject modifications of the programme of the World Economic Conference asimpossible if the President-Elect seems to be thinking along these lines. the ambassador will, of course, exercise great caution in encouraging any changes inthe arrangements for the World Conference, and the matter would have to be left open for report to London when Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s mature reflections on the subject had become available.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that in view of the complication of thematters to be discussed at the World Economic Conference, and the importanceof letting their treatment follow the course which at the time gives the best prospect for co-operation, it will be very necessary that the inaugural declarationof the incoming President should not limit the freedom of action which heeventually intends to claim and to exercise. We feel sure that this is also Mr.roosevelt&apos;s view, and we hope that the Ambassador will take advantage of any opportunity that may offer for bringing this point to Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s notice. Anyfurther information which he may care to request so that he may frame his address with the results he desh*es will, of course, be most readily forthcoming.; ,7. HisMajesty&apos;s Government have succeeded in preventing any informationwhatever reaching the press as to the contents of Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s previousconversation with the Ambassador, and the whole matter has been kept withinthe strictest and smallest circle of confidants. His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose to follow the same course about the impending interview between the ambassador and Mr. Roosevelt, and are convinced that the best prospect of useful negotiation will be secured if nothing is announced from either Govern-ment until the results of these February consultations have matured in a definitearrangement as to the date and nature of the proposed visit.February, 10, 1933.II. Settlement of the War Debt to the Lniteu States of America.memorandum-andum by the Treasury.. - 1. There are two conditions which require to be fulfilled by any settlement which may be reached with regard to the War Debt to the United States ofAmerica, viz.(a) that the settlement shall not be such as to. involve a reopening of the. Lausanne Agreement; and.   : (&amp;) that any future payments by the United Kingdom shall hot be more than can be covered by our receipts from our own debtors.        &apos;, .The Lausanne Settlement. &apos; !      &quot;--.!&apos;     i2.: Throughout the post-war period the question of Reparations has been a constant menace to European peace and stability. The settlement of 1921 broke down and led to the occupation of the Ruhr and to the collapse of the mark. the dawes Plan which followed was maintained for five years but then had to bereplaced by the Young Plan, which in turn broke down, and only as the result of
the Hoover moratorium was an immediate crisis averted. On each occasion the liabilities of Germany have been scaled down, but none of these settlements werefinal. Only after prolonged and difficult negotiations was it possible at Lausanneto reach an agreement accepted by all the. different Governments concerned as reasonable.But the Lausanne Agreement represents far more than the settlement of theReparation question. It represents also a great political effort to obliterate theanimosities engendered by the war and to restore an atmosphere of peaceful co-operation in Europe. As stated in the Declaration embodied in the Agreement,the signatory Powers had &quot; the firm intention of helping to create a new order,permitting the establishment and development of confidence, between the nations in a mutual spirit of reconciliation, collaboration and justice.&quot; If this settlement where not to be ratified, the political reactions, both in Germany and between germany and the rest of Europe, could not be foreseen.On the economic side Lausanne was equally important. The FinancialCrisis of 1931 led to the collapse of credit and confidence and sapped commercialenterprise and initiative. As soon as the Lausanne Agreement was signed, therewas a marked, though short-lived, revival of confidence which led to an upward trend of both commodity prices and security prices. His Majesty&apos;s government believe that the final ratification of the Lausanne Agreement will lead to a real and permanent revival of confidence : on the other hand, if the reparationsquestion were to be reopened, confidence throughout the world would be furtherundermined and the fall in prices and economic distress of the world would beaccentuated. .,The financial effect of the Lausanne Agreement was to provide. that, all the creditor Powers of Germany should receive 5 per cent. Bonds for .3. milliards ofReichsmarks (equivalent to 715 million dollars, or  210 million at present ratesof exchange*), such Bonds not to be marketed for three years, and thereafter only if and when German credit was so completely restored as to enable them to beissued close on par. Thus the maximum German payment represents an annualcharge for 50 years of, say, 39 million dollars ( 11-g million), of which the british share would under existing Agreements be about one-fifth, less than  2^ million per annum. -British claims on Europe. -3. The pre-Lausanne claims of Great Britain in respect of allied debts and reparations amounted nominally to  48 million sterling a year, viz., Allied debts 18 million payable in sterling and German reparations under the Young Plan. 21 million payable in gold (equivalent to, say,  30 million sterling at present rates of exchange). The British claims on their European Allies were based onthe debtors&apos; credit alone, and this was made clear throughout the war debtnegotiations with them. But under the Young Plan the payments to be made toGreat Britain by her debtors were to be recovered by the latter as part of theirown reparation receipts from Germany. The European debtor Powers will almost certainly maintain that they can only reduce their claims on Germany, asproposed at Lausanne, if His Majesty&apos;s Government do not claim additional payments from them on their own credit. If, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment try to recover their war debt claims from France and Italy, these latterPowers will either appeal to the Lausanne settlement and refuse to pay anything more than they receive under that settlement, or they will refuse to ratify the lausanne settlement and claim from Germany whatever is asked from them either by the United Kingdom or by the United States of America. In the latter eventthey are not likely to make effective payments unless they succeed in obtaining thenecessary sums from Germany. But nothing is more certain than that the lausanne settlement represents the maximum sum that can. be obtained fromGermany.. &quot;&apos;&apos; &apos;&quot;* &apos; &apos;-4    The only solution consistent with the Lausanne Agreement would there-,  fore be.that, the United States of America should accept from the whole of itsEuropean Debtors sums equivalent to the eventual proceeds of the LausanneBonds, viz., not exceeding 715 million dollars capital, or fifty annuities of39 million dollars. &apos;        &apos;-&apos; Exchange ,-ate taken throughout, &amp;S*4D JJfj^Isk &quot;/ -a..?       ir;sj.rv;q&apos;&apos;*-
Effect of Reducing Interest Charges to &quot; Italian Terms.&quot;5. It has been suggested that the President-Elect may be prepared to contemplate a reduction of future payments by the United Kingdom government by reducing interest charges, both past and future, to a nominal figure, or bywaiving them altogether. ,As an example of reduction of interest to a more or less nominal figure, theapplication of &quot; Italian terms &quot; to the British debt might be considered..&apos;     -The Italian debt to the United States of America was settled on termsproviding for no interest to be charged until 1930, and thereafter interest to becharged at. rates rising from one-eighth of 1 per cent, for the years 1930-40 to2 per cent, for the years 1980-87.These rates are equivalent to an average interest rate of 0-4 per cent., andif future payments by the United Kingdom to the United States of America werescaled down to this basis we should, if a flat annuity were fixed, have to pay(at the present rate of exchange)  28 million a year for fifty years. Alternatively,a rising scale of annuities calculated on Italian terms would involve paymentsrising from  9f million in 1934 to  14f million in 1944,  21^ million in 1954, 29 million in 1964,  38 million in 1974, and  50 million in 1984.There is clearly no possibility of settling on this basis, without wrecking the lausanne Agreement.Nor could an acceptable basis be found by making the offer retrospective..If we were granted &quot; Italian terms &quot; from the outset and were given credit forthe excess payments already made, we should still have to pay on a scale rising from  7 million in 1934 to  10f million in 1944,  15f million in 1954, 27f million in 1974 and  37f million in 1987, or. alternatively a flat fifty-yearannuity of  18 million a year.Effect of Waiving all Interest Charges.6.   The effect of waiving all interest charges, past and future, would be as;follows :-, , - / - , ..  ....    . &apos;    -The aggregate capital of the European War Debts due to the United Statesof America by the Creditor Powers of Germany as funded was about 11,000million dollars. This, however, included a considerable amount of interest whichwas funded, and if all interest is excluded from the date of the original advances,.the total would be reduced to 9,248 million dollars. As against this total, thepayments already made under the Funding Agreements (mainly for interest)amount to 1,718 million dollars. If all these payments are treated as repayments,of capital, the amount now outstanding is 7,530 million dollars. To repay this in fifty years without interest requires fifty annuities of 151 million dollars as -compared with the maximum of 39 million dollars a year that is equivalent to-what Germany may be required to pay under the Lausanne Agreement. Thuseven if all interest, past and future, were to be waived the debtors of america would still remain liable for payments to the United States of America equivalentto 3f times the maximum amount which could be received by them under the lausanne Agreement.7 Even therefore if all interest, both before and after funding, were entirely eliminated, the &quot;all-round&quot; settlement could only be obtained if theburden on Germany were increased nearly fourfold and made definite instead ofcontingent.   This is clearly impossible. -Further Possible Reductions.... .....      .......      :;.8. It will therefore be necessary not only to eliminate all. interest,, whether before or after funding, but also to secure a further substantial reduction, of theclaims of the United States of America if those claims are to be brought down toa figure which can be reconciled with the Lausanne settlement., .&apos; , 9. One &quot;argument which might be used is that the British debt obligationsshould be further scaled down in proportion to the depreciation of sterling, whichhas greatly affected the burden of the British debt. But this argument wouldnot apply to the Continental Powers, whose position also has to be considered ifa general settlement is to be reached.
10. An alternative procedure would be to reduce the capital debt in proportion to&apos;the fall in world prices. It is well known that the bulk of thewar debts were incurred in the purchase of commodities at the inflated pricerlevels ruling towards &apos; the end of the War. Prices have since fallen by approximately one-half; thus repayment at the original price involves doubling the liability in terms of present-day value of goods.In this event, of course, the repayments already made, as well as the originalcapital debt, would have to be adjusted in accordance with the price level at the relevant dates.   This has been done in the calculations which follow : -&apos; .&apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;    &apos;     . : &apos; iSettlement on the basis of (1) No interest; and (2) Allowance for the.    fall in prices.In the ease of the United Kingdom                   Million million dollars. dollars.The Capital Debt of   ...          ... ...      4,277 ...is scaled down to ...          ... ...         ... 1,972The repayments of      ...          ... ...      1,447 ...are scaled down to...          ... ...         ... 1,067Leaving a net debt of        ... ... 905In the other cases (added together) The Capital Debts of ... ... ...      4,971, ...are scaled down to... ... ...       . ... 2,550The repayments of      ... ... ...         271 ...are scaled down to... ... ...... 181Leaving a net debt of ... ... 2,369Assuming that repayment without interest is spread over fifty years, the annuities due by each Power would be  million dollars.The United Kingdom     . ... ... 18   ( 5-* million)France    ... ... ... ... 26Italy      ...       ,  ... ... .... 16 ,Belgium and Minor Powers... ... b\65111, Even this figure is very considerably more than the maximum receivable,from Germany-viz. : 39 million dollars and some further adjustment would still be required. How such an adjustment could be obtained is a matter forfurther discussion, but at least, in view of the disproportionate amounts already paid by Great Britain, as compared with the other debtors, it is clear that nofurther burden should be imposed on this country in connection therewith.12. Assuming that some acceptable scheme could be evolved, the most satisfactory plan would be for Great Britain to forego future receipts from europe and be absolved from future payments to the United ,States of America,and to leave the United States of America to settle with France, Italy, &amp;C&apos;, on.the basis of the payments to be made by Germany under the Lausanne Agreement.Such an arrangement would not of course mean that, over the whole period,the British receipts from reparations and allied war debts have covered thepayments made in respect of the British War Debt to America. On the contrary,before the^HoOver Moratorium, the aggregate British payments had amounted;to  326 million, against aggregate receipts from reparations (including deliveries in kind, &amp;c), and allied war debts of  192 million, leaving a deficit of 134 million. If interest at 5 per cent, is added to both sides of the account, the deficit would be about  200 million; and this deficit has since been increased.bythe payment of  30 million sterling made on the 1.5th December, 1932; Thus,the United Kingdom borrowed from the United States  850 million; she herselflent to the Allies  1,600 million, and had large claims on Germany for repara-
tions. She has, in fact, paid on her debt to the United States all that she hasreceived from reparations and War Loans together (viz.,  192 million), and overand above that a further  164 million capital, excluding interest.13. Alternatively, revised settlements might be made between the UnitedStates of America and each of its debtors within the limits of their respectiveshares of the Lausanne payments, each debtor power being responsible for its share of the total payments to be made.(Such payments to the United States of America Vould, of course, be conditional on equivalent payments being forthcoming from Germany.)14. The fact is that the United States of America and the United kingdom are co-creditors of a bankrupt world, and a settlement has to be reached betweenthem on the basis of what can be recovered from their joint debtors. If theUnited States Government are not prepared to reach a settlement with HisMajesty&apos;s Government on this basis, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be facedwith the choice between two alternatives : either to maintain the LausanneAgreement in Europe and suspend payments to America pending the negotiation of a general settlement on the basis of that Agreement, or to effect the paymentsrequired by the United States of America, but at the same time to recover any payments thus made from their debtors in Europe, with incalculable consequenceson European financial and political stability. It will be quite impossible for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to contemplate a continuance of payments by them to theUnited States without recovery from their own debtors in Europe; and it isequally impossible for them to contemplate a breakdown of the Lausanne settle-ment. In these circumstances, if an impasse is to be avoided, they can onlysuggest that the United States Government should agree to a moratorium of war debt payments pending a general discussion with all the signatories of the lausanne Agreement as to the best means of arriving at a settlement of the wholequestion, which would satisfy the requirements of the United States withoutundermining the efforts at reconstruction made by the European Powers.III. Economic Problems.Memorandum by the Treasury covering a Statement of Economic Policy for sir R. Lindsay&apos;s use.15. It has been suggested that the United States President may find itdifficult to present a debt settlement to Congress unless, in appearance at least,it is accompanied by concessions on the part of Great Britain. We have as yet no clear idea what concessions may be proposed, and in all probability theAmerican ideas are still in a very fluid state. Vague references have been madeto concessions on disarmament, but it seems almost certain that as discussions,develop the tendency will be to concentrate on (a) The return of Great Britain and other countries to the gold standard;Cb) Commercial concessions by Great Britain to the United States;(c) Measures, especially by the Government of India, to increase the price of&apos;silver.  .16. The restoration of an international monetary standard (after-appropriate conditions have been fulfilled), the freeing of international commerceby moderating tariffs and by abolishing quota and exchange restrictions, and the:special position of silver were all discussed at the recent meeting at Geneva of thePreparatory Committee for the World Conference. Some progress was made inlaying down principles which were acceptable to the United States experts as.weir as to ourselves, and on many points the views of the United States andBritish experts were more closely in accord than those of other countries. But itshould be borne in mind that the United States experts were not Governmentalrepresentatives.17. The recommendations of the Preparatory Committee can only be-implemented as a result of real co-operation by all the principal countries of the;world.   Agreement between the United States, Great Britain and France is, in
STATEMENT OF BRITISH POLICY ON ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.i 24. His. Majesty&apos;s Government warmly welcome the suggestion of thePresident-Elect that concurrently with the discussion of War Debts there shouldbe a discussion of World Economic problems in which the two Governments aremutually interested. It is a matter of vital moment to the peoples of the UnitedKingdom, as it is to the people of the United States of America, to counteract the present world depression, to relieve the constant pressure of unemployment,to restore the level of prices and to revive prosperity. It becomes more and moreclear that the operation of normal economic forces cannot be relied upon to bring this about in any reasonable period and. that positive action by Governments is called for to expedite it. But in fact the efforts made by each Government up tothe. present time, have been singularly ineffective and there is growing impatienceon the part of, the ordinary man and woman in. all countries at the apparentinability of their Government to master the blind forces which seem to be working&apos;--&apos;-yf &apos; [8203] &quot; ff^^l^;^^ nmiifmfM:W:i&apos;^)any case, indispensable. Nevertheless, a preliminary survey of the agenda inconsultation with the United States Government is exactly what we should have wished for in ordinary circumstances. We should also desire similar consulta-tions with the French and some other Governments before the Conference meets..18. But the whole position is complicated by the dispute on war debts-Whereas we most heartily desire to co-operate with the United States Goyern-ment on the questions, arising out of the Agenda, the whole position is distortedif such consultation is represented as meaning concessions, to our detriment andto the advantage of the United States, intended as a quid pro quo to a reduction,of war debts.19. In our opinion, what we should aim at is an agreed programme ofco-operation between us and the United States with a view to saving our twocountries and the world at large from disaster. &apos;20. The draft statement of British Policy on economic problems containedin paragraphs 24 to 88 below has been prepared with a view to indicatingwhat could be said to the United States Government. If it is read closelyit will be apparent how little there is which could plausibly be represented as a quid pro quo for debt reduction. A very early return of Great Britain tothe gold standard is much the more important object, in the eyes of the UnitedStates, though they have long since abandoned any hope that we shall return atthe old par. We also envisage a return to the gold standard, but the essential difference between our viewpoint and that of the United States is that they regard the return of Great Britain to gold as a first step to world recovery from whichall other results are to flow, whereas we envisage our return to gold as &quot;the culmination of a long process of reform and reconstruction in world conditions.21. It would be injudicious on our part to introduce the question of temporary stabilisation of sterling, though no doubt the Americans may raise it.While we could indicate our strong desire to limit fluctuations in exchange due topurely speculative influences, it is certain that we should not satisfy them out his point either.22. As regards Anglo-American tariff discussions, our exports of domesticproducts to the United States in 1932 were only  15 million and it is obviouslya question of asking for concessions from them rather than making concessions,ourselves.23. As regards silver which is much more a matter for the Indian Govern-ment than for ourselves, certain promises of co-operation might possibly be made;but in reality the demand of the United States silver producers is that the indian and other Governments shall be prohibited from selling surplus silver in orderthat silver producers may increase their own production, ft is certain that;theIndian Government could not be expected to. entertain sq one-sided an arrange-ment (see paragraph 35). , .
relentlessly to a general breakdown of the financial, economic and social structure of society. The fact is that the depression cannot be effectively remedied byisolated action on the part of individual Governments : it is essentially inter-national in its character and requires for its solution international action on avery broad front. It will therefore be necessary to secure concerted measures onthe&quot; part of all the principal countries of the world and the World Monetary andEconomic Conference offers an opportunity for devising such measures. But itwould greatly help towards success in that Conference if the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the United States President were similar towards the objectives to be promoted at the Conference, and His Majesty&apos;s Government fortheir part will gladly enter into an exchange of views to this end.25. The Report and Agenda for the World Conference, recently elaboratedby the Preparatory Commission of experts appointed by the League of Nations,affords a useful basis for this discussion. The Report of the Commission, acceptedunanimously by eminent experts of seventeen different countries, including all theprincipal countries of Europe, the United States of America, the Argentine,China and India, as well as by representatives of the Bank for international settlements and other international institutions, sets out in a clear and conciseform the actual position and the programme which the Governments have to face,followed by an annotated agenda summarising the detailed issues involved.Taking this programme as the basis. His Majesty&apos;s Government propose toindicate the general lines on which they would envisage co-operation between theUnited States of America and the United Kingdom in promoting a solution of theworld economic problems.Rise in the Level of Prices.26. It is accepted in all quarters that an increase in the general level of world prices and, more particularly, in the prices of farm commodities-is highly desirable. His Majesty&apos;s Government are in entire agreement with thisview and have repeatedly declared that it is one of the main objects of their policy to secure a rise in wholesale prices, especially in the wholesale prices of foodstuffs and raw materials, not only in Great Britain but throughout the world. Whilethe export trade of Great Britain is mainly in manfactured goods, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are convinced that no real prosperity can be secured by the manu-facturing interests until the primary producers in all countries are once more in-a position to recommence normal purchases.A vivid sketch of the existing price situation is given in the introduction tothe Report of the Preparatory Commission. Wholesale commodity prices ingeneral have fallen by over one-third since October 1929, while raw material prices have dropped by from 50 to 60 per cent, since that date. The remedial measures which appeared to the Preparatory Commission to deserve considerationare mentioned on page 8 of the Agenda, while a fuller analysis is given on pages 18 to 20.27. Monetary action is, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, necessaryto secure a rise in prices. It is a question whether monetary action is sufficientby itself to raise prices without long delay, which the condition of the worldhardly permits, but that does not alter the fact that monetary action is necessaryto create the conditions in which a price rise can take place. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment believe that many valuable results have been achieved by themeasures taken both in the United States of America and in London to ensurethe provision of cheap and abundant short-term money, but on the other hand, theyare convinced that well co-ordinated action between the leading Central Banksis likely to have more effect in improving world conditions than isolated effortsby particular countries. His Majesty ^Government would be happy to co-operate in any measures which the United States Government might think well designedto secure this object. .28. Monetary action, however, operates only. to increase the supply of credit, and simultaneous action is required to increase the demand. Monetaryaction would require to be: supplemented therefore by action to restore the purchasing power of debtor countries, to promote international trade and in somecases to.regulate production, All these interconnected problems, are dealt with inthe? Agenda and must receive detailed consideration at the /World Economic
Conference. The concerted action of many countries is required for success, but,as already indicated, His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that a preliminary survey by the two Governments would be most helpful.Stabilisation of Currencies.29. Among the difficulties confronting international trade a prominentplace must be assigned to currency disorganisation. The world crisis whichcommenced in the Autumn of 1929 has now lasted for more than three years.For the first two years of that period practically the whole world remained on thegold standard. But the continued disastrous fall in prices and the steady and rapid diminution in trade made currency breakdown inevitable. With the inter-national economic system in course of rapid destruction it was impossible that aninternational currency system should survive. Very few countries now retainfree gold standard currency systems. A large number have remained nominallyattached to gold, but only by imposing restrictions which are destructive of tradeand financial intercourse between nations. Other countries have abandoned thegold standard.30. A general return to an international monetaiy standard would be^welcomed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but they fear that this will not be apractical possibility until some degree of health has been restored to the inter-national economic system. The experience of the first two years of the crisisindicated the defective conditions under which the international monetarystandard then worked, while the struggle of so many countries to remain attachedto that standard by the adoption of deflationary measures and by placing growing-restrictions on trade was a powerful factor in accelerating the collapse. Ageneral return to the gold standard, so long as that is only possible by deflationarymeasures or by imposing fresh restrictions on trade could but do harm.On the other hand, provided that a reasonable degree of equilibrium betweenprices and costs can be restored and the defects which have shown themselves inthe working of the Gold Standard are removed by suitable international co--operation, His Majesty&apos;s Government, as at present advised, see no reason whythe way should not be open to the re-establishment of an international system.Exchange Controls.31. The Exchange controls recently imposed by many countries and the clearing and compensation agreements to which they have given rise, have proved a most serious obstacle to international trade. His Majesty&apos;s Government would gladly, co-operate with the Government of the United States in pressing for theabolition of all such measures. It must be recognised, however, that many of thecountries which have adopted these controls will plead their inability to removethem, unless they are first assured against a collapse of their currencies by theprovision of additional foreign exchange reserves or by the readjustment of theirexternal commercial debts. The United Kingdom and the United States ofAmerica have in the past been the largest international capital markets, andthey have common interests in securing that these difficulties are wisely dealtwith. Owing to the collapse of confidence, it is hardly to be expected that the flow of international capital can be resumed in the near future through theordinary market channels, and it may be necessary to contemplate special measures(such as have been set on foot in the United States for internal purposes) tofacilitate the revival of international credit. Any such action would largely depend on the possibility of securing co-operation between Central Banks, witha view to putting into circulation resources which are at present immobilised,and the precise method by which this could best be done would require careful investigation by the financial authorities of the principal creditor countries.His Majesty&apos;s Government would willingly associate themselves with the UnitedStates Government in furthering such an investigation, as it appears to themthat a restoration of world prices must depend in a large measure on thepossibility of restoring the purchasing power of the debtor countries, whether in Europe or overseas.Relaxation of Trade Barriers.32. The Preparatory Commission points out that one of the most significant-features of the present crisis is the fall which has taken place not only in the
value but in the quantum ot international trade. Apart from exchange controls,the principal reason for this fall seems to be the growing network of quantitative restrictions on international trade in the form of prohibitions and quotas on imports which have recently been imposed. &apos;These restrictions on imports have proved a far greater obstacle to inter-national trade than any tariffs, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would gladlyco-operate with the United States Government in pressing for a general agreementwith a view to their relaxation and their abolition as soon as possible, particularly as regards manufactures. As regards farm products, and particularly meat anddairy products, exceptional measures may be required to cope with the presentglut, and the possibility of relaxation will depend largely on the possibility of ensuring a better regulation of production (see paragraph 36 below).Tariffs.33. His Majesty&apos;s Government would also favour a general agreement forthe reduction of tariffs and for the maintenance of a more moderate tariff policyin the future. They have in the past supported the most unconditional interpre-tation of the most-favoured-nation clause, and their existing treaty obligationsrender it difficult for them to accept proposals which might conflict with most-favoured-nation rights. They would, however, be ready to consider co-operationwith the United States with a view to securing (a) a general Gentleman&apos;s agreement under which no country would increase its actual tariffs above theirexisting level pending the outcome of the Conference, and (b) an arrangement for the gradual reduction of high protective tariffs to a more moderate level. Asregards any tariff truce, it must be remembered that the British tariff represents a comparative!y low measure of protection and it would not be possible for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to tie their hands for an indefinite period by adopting-an arrangement which stereotypes the existing position. As regards reduction-of tariffs, it must be borne in mind that the national budgets of many countriesdepend on high revenue duties on spirits, tobacco and other luxuries.Anglo-American Tariff Discussions.34. As regards direct American trade with this country, it is obvious fromthe figures that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not in a position to offer anysubstantial advantages over and above those which America already enjoys. Forthe year 1931 British imports from the United States of America amounted to 104 million, while the exports of British domestic products to the United states were  18 million; for the year 1932 British imports from America were 84 million, and domestic exports only  15 million. There is, therefore, an enormous excess of United States exports to this country over British exportsto the United States. As it is essential to restore equilibrium in the balance ofpayments if sterling is to be stabilised, the United; Kingdom can obviously not afford to buy larger quantities of United States goods unless the United Statesoffer greatly increased outlets for the manufactures&apos; of this country. HisMajesty&apos;s Government will, however, gladly enter into discussions, if and whenthe United States so desire, with a view to concluding a tariff agreement on thebasis of reciprocity.Silver.35. As regards silver, the Preparatory Commission point out that such schemes as bimetallism, &amp;c, are impossible of adoption, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment assume that the United States concur in this view. The Expertsalso agreed that what is required is not a rise in the price of silver as such(which would&apos; involve great economic difficulties for the silver-using countries,particularly China), but a rise in the general level of commodity prices whichwould bring up the value of silver at the same time. The criticism levelled, againstthe Indian Government in connection with silver is largely due to misapprehen-sion. The Government of India has made no radical alteration&apos;&apos;in ,&apos;its currency/system during the last forty years, but it has been greatly embarrassed by thesurplus silver flowing into its reserves following upon the fall in commodity prices. It would not be possible for the Government of India to agree to restrictsales of silver from these reserves while there was no similar restriction on salesby the silver producers. It may be pointed out that in fact, on balance, over thelast few years the Government of India has increased, hot decreased, the stocksof silver held hi its reserves.  The most that could be said on this subject is that
39. The above review of the situation shows that a settlement both of war debts and of the other economic problems necessarily entails international co--operation, not only between the United States and the United Kingdom, butbetween all the principal countries of the world. The difficulties of making progress on any one problem are very great, but the Governments would not beforgiven by their peoples if they failed to make the most resolute efforts to arriveat solutions in the common interest. His Majesty&apos;s Government would greatlyprefer a settlement to be reached of War Debts in the first instance, as this is aquestion which is under the immediate control of certain Governments, and they believe that its settlement would very greatly promote progress on the widereconomic questions. But if a settlement satisfactory to both Governments is atpresent unattainable, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to discussall the factors of the present world crisis, including war debts, concurrently. Inthat event they would, if necessary, suggest that the discussion of war debtsshould be postponed until the World Economic Conference is held, and that itshould be carried on concurrently with that Conference. In the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government it would be essential if the Conference is to achieve any measure of success that it should be free from the menace of a possible reopening of Reparations, and, in the absence of prior agreement as to debts, they trust that the Government of the United States of America would be able to arrangefor the suspension of all War Debt payments until the deliberations of theConference were concluded. .....February 10, 1933.the Government of India have expressed their readiness to discuss an arrange-1ment with the silver producers with a view to some general regulation of sales of silver.Regulation of Production.36. While the regulation of production has many critics, it appears to HisMajesty&apos;s Government that some measure of this kind may be justified and helpful in the case of certain primary materials, especially where large stocks are over-hanging the market. Regulation schemes are already in existence for sugar and tin, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are proposing to call a Conference inorder to secure an agreement for the regulation of production in the meat trade.They are also contemplating further agreements in respect of dairy produce.As regards wheat, His Majesty&apos;s Government are not directly interested, asthe United Kingdom is an importing country, but they agree that the EconomicConference should consider the possibility of an international agreement betweenthe main producing countries for a restriction of acreage in those countriescoupled with a reduction in the excessive tariffs on wheat now imposed in someof the more important consuming countries.37. In this connection His Majesty&apos;s Government would like to point outthe particular interest which they have in seeking to put the shipping industry on a more economic basis. At the present time the subsidies to shipping givenby many countries has led to the construction and the working of a much greatertonnage than is required by existing intexmational trade, so that in many countriesshipping has become a burden on the national economy, instead of a contributionto its prosperity. They will welcome the co-operation, of the United StatesGovernment in securing a remedy for this situation.38. His Majesty&apos;s Government have here outlined the objectives.which theywould aim at securing by the World Economic Conference, and they trust thatthe Government of the United States will find it possible to support similarobjectives. But it is essential to stress throughout that any hope of arriving atbetter conditions is dependent on a satisfactory settlement of the War Debtsquestion having been reached, or at least assured. The existence of these debtsconstitutes, as the Preparatory Commission have said, an insuperable barrier to continue and financial reconstruction, and there is no prospect of the world economic Conference making progress if this barrier cannot be removed.
