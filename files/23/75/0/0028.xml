^CO-OPERATIVE 2.   The Cabinet discussed briefly the questionSOCIETIES .  of the taxation of Co-operative Societies.Proposedtaxation The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed hisof.colleagues that the opponents of the Co-operative(Previous Societies on this matter were now active.   OpinionReference:Cabinet 25 in the Conservative Party had hardened very consider-(33), Con-clusion 1.) ably owing to the picketing and other pressure that had been exerted by the Co-operatives on Members ofParliament.    If nothing were done in the directionof taxing the Co-operative Societies there would be strong expressions of disagreement in the House ofCommons .Since the Cabinet last discussed the questionan analysis had been made of the effect of his proposal on the taxation of the Co-operatives, fromwhich the unexpected fact had emerged that the taxation would fall almost entirely on the RetailSocieties, leaving the Wholesale Societies almostunaffected.Since the Meeting of the Cabinet, also, theChancellor had discussed the matter with the repre-sentatives of the Co-operative Societies,   He had explained to them that from a revenue point of view the matter was not of the first Importance, but thatit seemed unfortunate that a section of the population should think that they were unjustly affected by the exemption of Co-operative Societies;    that he understood that the principle of mutuality was thematter to which they attached the greatest importance.He had then suggested that perhaps some arrangement might be entered into.   He had explained the proposals that had been discussed at the Cabinet, and had pointed out that the Exchequer would only receive from these proposals about two-thirds of what they-2-
46 (Uwould obtain under the Raeburn Report.   He had theninformed them of the analysis that had been made and of the extent to which it would affect the retail Societies .   He had suggested that possiblythey might make some arrangement between the wholesale and the Retail Societies to adjust theburden.   He then described the attitude of theCo-operative Societies, who had made certain repre-sentations to him of their grievances,   eventually the Societies had decided to hold a meeting that afternoon and see if they could find some alternative proposal.   As they were divided among themselves,however, the Chancellor felt a good deal of doubt asto whether it wrould be possible for them to put up any acceptable proposal.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  That, if he was unable to reach agreement with the Co-operative societies, the Chancellor of theExchequer should have authorityto proceed in accordance with thedecisions of the Cabinet at theMeeting referred to in the margin.It was&quot;realised that this wouldinvolve legislation sooner or later if and when the Co-operative societies took steps to evadetaxation,* *        43, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,April 15, 19 33.
