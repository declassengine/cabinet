 EE TOTALISATORTtN TOTE OLUBSAND ON GREYHOUNDRAGING TRACKS.(PreviousReferenceCabinet68 (32)Conclusion12).l.In pursuance of the conclusion mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet had before them the Report (paper C.P. 1    (33))of the Cabinet Committee,to which was attached a copy of the Interim Report of the RoyalCommission on Lotteries and Betting.The Cabinet Committee&apos;9 Report ineffect recommended that as regards tote clubsin England and Wales the law should be allowed totake its course, and that as regards such clubsin Scotland steps should be taken to secure thatthe legal position in Scotland is brought into conformity in this respect with the position inEngland and Wales.     As regards totalisators ongreyhound racing tracks, that no legislation should be introduced to legalise these totalis-waters, and that the law should be allowed totake its course.     In the event of the Cabinetaccepting these suggestions, the committee recommended inter alia that the announcement ofthe Governments policy should make it clearthat legislation would be required to enabletotalisators to continue on greyhound racingtracks and that the Government were not preparedto introduce such legislation.The Cabinet also: had before them a supplementary Report (Paper CP. 13 (33)) bythe Cabinet Committee in which it was explainedthat since the circulation of their Report tothe Cabinet, certain circumstances had beenbrought to the notice of the Committee which
&amp; indicated that a delay of several months may ensue beforethe situation with regard to tote clubs will be clear, and before it will be possible to take effective action tobring about the complete suppression of these clubs.Moreover, the Committee had been warned of the furtherrisk that, as a result of an adverse decision in theCourts, it might still be possible for tote clubs to carryon their activities by devices which the Courts might decide are not contrary to the existing law.In these circumstances the Committee had considered whether the Cabinet should be recommended to introduce legislation to deal with tote clubs, and had taken theopportunity of reviewing the whole question of the use ofthe tote, both in the tote clubs and on greyhound tracks,In the light of the altered situation.In their Supplementary Report (CP. 13(33)) theCommittee summarised the possible courses of action,together with a brief statement of the arguments for and against each course, and concluded the Report with a listof specific questions on which Cabinet decisions arerequired.As regards Tote Clubs, the Cabinet agreed that the law should be allowed to take its course, and that if it was found that   evasion of the law was taking place,       legisla-tion should be passed to prevent it.As regards totalisators on greyhound racing tracks,the Cabinet also considered that the law should be allowedto take its course.    In this case, however, hesitation wasI felt as to the expediency of announcing that legislationwotild be enacted to secure the suppression of totalisatorsin the event of legal devices being found to circumventthe law or if the Courts should decide that the use oftotalisators is not illegal, whether in England or Scotland.-2-
The reason for this hesitation was not a. desireto permit totalisators on greyhound racing tracks, andthere was no question of legislation for legalisingtheir use;   but doubts were expressed as to whether the elimination of the tot allsator, unless supplemented byother measures, would check the betting evils thatsurround greyhound racing.    The totalisator,  it was realised   was certain to be replaced on greyhound racing tracks by other systems of betting:    for example,through bookmakers or other methods .    It was suggestedthat, before legislation was introduced,  it was necessaryto have information on these matters, which are atpresent the subject of investigation by the RoyalCommission on Lotteries and Betting.   To deal withtotalisators on greyhound racing tracks in isolationmight, it was suggested, embarrass the Government afew months later when it had to consider legislation of wider scope resulting from the Royal Commission&apos;sFinal Report.On the other hand, the Cabinet were reminded thatthe Government had. been advised that both Tote Clubsand totalisators on greyhound racing tracks wereillegal, and consequently the law would have to been forced.    If no announcement of policy were made ata time when prosecutions were being undertaken, theposition would be ambiguous and unfair to persons engaged, in the industry.   The Government would certainly be pressed in Parliament to announce their policy inthe event of adverse decisions in the Courts.   Conse-quently it was urged that the Government could not afford to refrain from announcing a definite policy.One suggestion was that the best eventual solution might be to regulate the totalisator on greyhound racing tracks in the same manner as on race-courses .This would result in a great reduction in the number--
of greyhound racing tracks, the disappearance of themore dubious concerns, a limitation to reasonablefigures of the number of racing fixtures, and thesubordination of the tracks to local government.Moreover, it would be an answer to the claim that the suppression of the totalisator on greyhound racingtracks while it was retained for horse-racing, involved&quot;one law for the rich and another for the poor&quot;.The suggestion, however, which met with mostsupport, was that an announcement should be made onthe following lines:-The Government nave decided to acceptthe Report of the Royal Commission onthe Use of Totalisators on GreyhoundCourses as well as in ^ote Clubs.   Tivayare advised that in both cases totalisav-tors are illegal,  and the Royal Commissionreports that in the public interest they ought to be illegal.    Anyone who oontiw^to use totalisators will do so at riskand is probably acting contrary to the law;.   The intention of the Governmentis to enf oroe/^tho &apos;low &quot;e-o- -l-ong .0,0. thoyAJ agenda -s* fw-^*- %3t&amp;&amp;- supported by the Courts.   TheGovernment has not yet decided on itscourse in the event of its view of thelaw not being supported by the Courts,or of evasion of the law by methods that were not illegal.   That aspect of thequestion is ciosely bound up with thegeneral question of betting facilities on greyhound racing tracks other than bymeans of the totalisator, - a matter whichthe Royal Commission has reserved for its final Report. (Para,71.)    It would beinconvenient to legislate for that parti-cular form of betting before legislatingon the whole question.   Consequently thepolicy could not be announced until theFinal Report was received.The only doubt expressed about this policy wasthat it might leave matters in uncertainty for sometime, as the Royal Commission was not expected toreport for three or four months at best, and possiblymuch later in the year.    In addition, the test cases and appeals  in&quot;bhe COrnrfca nrigtit als-o- -ta^ko sorm- ^time . --4-
To reduce the delay involved, a suggestion wasmade that the Royal Commission might be invited tosubmit a second Interim Report dealing with the questionof forms of betting other than the tote on greyhound racing tracks.Some doubts were expressed, however, as to the advisability of this course, and the Prime minister suggested that it might be preferable for the present to base the Government&apos;s announcement solely on thelegal status quo and the facts, of the present situation.The Home Secretary then offered to prepare a draft announcement in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion,for consideration by his colleagues at their Meetingon Wednesday, February 1st.The Cabinet accepted this offer.
Q  RECREATIONAL S. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byFACILITIESFOR THE METRO- the Home Secretary (C.P.-7 (33)) covering a MemorandumPOLITANPOLICE. by Lord Trenchar d otitlining his proposals for providingrecreational facilities for the Metropolitan Police.The Home Secretary expressed his entire concurrence in lord Trenchard1s proposals, and invited Cabinet approvalof the question of principle involved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer having expressed his concurrence, the Cabinet approA^ed the HomeSecretary*s proposal in C.P.-7 (33).
6THE ADMINISTRATIONOP CROWN LANDS.(PreviousReferenceCabinet68 (32)Conclusion13).f.R.3. With reference to the conclusion mentioned in the margin under which the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries was authorisedto avail himself of a favourable opportunityto negotiate with Messrs. pinchin and Johnsonfor a reduction in the height of the new building they are erecting at No. 4, CarltonGardens, subject to his obtaining the authorityof the Chancellor of the Exchequer beforeagreeing to pay compensation, the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries reported to theCabinet that an interview had taken place withthe Managing Director of Messrs. Pinchin andJohnson, who had stated that his firm was notin a position to modify their arrangements, andthat they would be most reluctant to do so evenif they were offered an extravagant figure for compensation:    the figure named being 250,000 or  500,000.In these circumstances the Committeeon the Control of Crown Lands were unanimouslyof opinion that no useful purpose would be served by any further intervention by theGovernment in the matter of Messrs. Pinchin andJohnson&apos;s lease of No. 4, Carlton Gardens.The Cabinet concurred in theview of the Committee on theControl of Crown Lands, and authorised the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries tomake an announcement, in whichhe should endeavour to convey the impression that the cabinet had &apos;.      no alternative to thiscourse.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,January 26,  19 33.
