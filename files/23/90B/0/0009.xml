VOST SECRET -QABINgT  55 (32).THE IKint&apos;  FRFF  STAT .NEGOTIATION? WITH Vr DP valera(Previous Reference:Cabinet 53 fS2) 5.)ADDENDUM TO MINUTE 11fUnder instructtons from the Prime minister the following Minute, owing to its extremesecrecy, has beer, communicated only to thefollowingThe Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.Durinp the discussion of the subject recorded in Item 11 of the Cabinet Minutes referred to at thehead of this note, THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINIONAFFAIRS informed the Cabinet, in absolute secrecy, ofimportant developments in the negotiations -with theIrish Free State.   ?*e recalled that w^en the nei?ot ia-tions with &quot;T* de Valera had been broken off it had been understood that the latter should forward anotherdocument in reply to the last document of the british cabinet with a viev. to its publication in the white paper.   Mr de Valera had agreed-that a week was sufficient for the preparation of his document.   Nothing$SJCK having been received, the Secretary of Statefor D om i n 1 on fi f f a 1. rs, on v- end ay 0 o t ober 2.4 th, ha dtold wr de Valera that he intended to publish the
White Paper   on &quot;&quot;uesrtay without the new documentxmless he received a rspTy in the meanwhile,   ^r de valera had promised the document by this morning.On the pravioxjs day Vr Walshe, an importantCivil Servant of the Irish Free State, had brought toLondon an intimation that the Chirr Justice of Ireland,in whom in the ordinary course would vest the necessary powers and authorities on the. relinquishment of theoffice of 0-over-noG^nem.1 by Mr James McNeill, was unwilling to assume those powers and authorities for various reasons, amongst them being a conscientiousobjection to taking the Oath of Allegiance.   the significance of this information w*n that the chief justice had been Ht Cosgrave^ nominee and had notobjected to taking the Oath as Chief Justice.    Ut de valera had further announced that he proposed to advise*?is Majesty that, the President of the Executive council should be the person in whom the powers and authoritiesshould vest,The Secretary of State then read a note or a conversation whioh Mr Walnhe had hid with Sir HarryBatterbee, of the Dominions Of ice t A --oendi/;) .    !&apos;eemphasised more particularly the second point in   r&apos;*alshe&apos;s statement, viss., &quot;Acceptance of the settlement* as a friendly settlement as between two members of theCommonwealth * * .   The difficulty -was to decide whetherthis approach wa** a bluff or a weafcenimp&apos;, or represented a genuine desire on Vr de Valera*s part to modify his previous attitude and to proclaim himself a member ofthe British Commonwealth of nations.   If the latter was his intention it woul&apos;&apos; be worth a great deal.The Cabinet Committee had considered the question on the previous evening and had come to the oonolusion
that they oupht to consider the propels 1 as a seriousone, but on no account to fall into a trap or toallow any ambiguity to arise:    In a word, they must make their position perfectly clear.   mhey had therefore decided to suggest that Sir Harry Batterbeeshould hand the following reply to Vr Walahe:-1.   &quot;&quot;he essential points on which the UnitedKingdom Government must insist in any settlement with the Irish Free state*Government are:-(1) acceptance by the Irish Free stateGovernment of the 1921 Treaty asvalid and to be observed accordingto its term a unless and until itis altered by agreement *(2) that no further question should beraised by the Irish Free StateGovernment as to the validity ofthe Financial Settlement, asembodied in the Financial Arreementsof logs rand 1036 and the T-oundaryAgreement of 19135:(?) that acceptance of the ^treaty shouldbe accompanied on the part of theIrish Free State Government by(a) an undertaking not to proceed further with the Oath Pill,(b) suitable arrangements, inaccordance with the Treaty,to take effect on Mr SfoMeill &apos;srelinquishing the office orG governor-G-eneral.2.   Xf the above points -were accepted, theUnited Kingdom Government, with theobject of arriving at a friendly settle-merit as between two Members of theGomroonwealth, would be prepared:-(l) to discuss any modification of thepresent wording of the Oath, as,for example, to bring it into closercorrespondence with the wordingemployed in any other Dominion;(2) to discuss with the Irish Free StateGovernment methods by which thea    /   - present burden of the sums due to/ sit^dtAja^jz- Jfic^a-^e,ux     the Government of the United Kingdom/Qx^^Ji ^Jr^eot       could be mitigated:(3) to proceed forthwith to the negotia-tion of a Trade Agreement.
The Secretary of State explained that paragraph 2 (2) above, as he had read it, differed a little from the decision of the Cabinet Committee on the previous evening, which had read as follows:-

"to discuss with the Irish Free State Government the remission of some part of the sums due to the Government of the United Kingdom under the Financial Agreements above referred to."

The amended version had been adopted at the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Secretary of State emphasised how important it would be if Mr de Valera could be induced to accept paragraph 1 (3) above, which would make secure both the Oath and the office Governor-General. He had his doubts, however, as to whether Mr de Valera could accept. He also doubted whether the House of Commons would support any Government that did not insist on these two points. He pointed out also that the proposals of the Committee would in no way weaken Mr Cosgrave&apos;s position if Mr de Valera should accept them, since he would be in a position to say that Mr de Valera&apos;s method had been wrong all the time and that the Committee&apos;s proposal ought to have been adopted from the first.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the idea in his own mind in the negotiations with Mr de Valera had been that if the latter meant business the ultimate solution was a postponement, or a spreading over further years of the payments due. The negotiations had, however, broken down. Now it looked as if Mr de Valera felt himself compelled to go further. Consequently he himself had been looking further into the question, in case Mr de Valera should decide to throw ever his old associations and settle down with the Irish Free State as a Member of the British Empire. Mr de Valera&apos;s fifty-fifty proposal meant a reduction


^7in the Irish payments of 58,500,000 a year.   after making enquiries in the Treasury he had ascertained that the payments were made under several headings,namely. Land Annuities, Royal Irish Constabulary, andLooal Loans, all of which differed in such details asthe period over whiah payments extended.   If anextension of payment were allowed spread over SO years the immediate relief to the Irish Free State would be 500.000 a year.   If the spread-over were for 50 years the immediate relief would be about  1,000,000 a year.That pave sorne idea of what could be done,   A spread-over of payment would he far easier to defend than aremission.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR pointed out thatany concession to Mr de Valera would react against mr. Cosgrave, who had remained faithful to the Treaty.He thought the present proposal was probably someelectoral triok.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs pointed out that when March came we should probablyfind that we had only recovered about  1,000,000 of theIrish payments, and. we should have lost a good deal oftrade.   Fe hoped that these considerations would not be overlooked,   ^hew were only two alternatives:    eitherto say &quot;No&quot;, or to try and use the present opportunity.He thought that a settlement on the lines proposed bythe Cabinet Committee would be popular in this country.After some further discussion, in the course ofwhich the Cabinet were reminded that the Irish FreeState oould only make payments in the form of agrioul-tural produce, which was detrimental to our own agri-culture (apart from the need for Irish store cattle incertain Counties), the Cabinet agreed  
That the Secretary of state forDominion Affairs should authoriseSir Harry Hatterbee to make a communication to ttr Walsh3 in theterms proposed by the CabinetCommittee, as set forth above:but that Sir Harry Fatterhee, inhand in? the statement to Mr Walshe,should make clear that this was not an official document committing theO&amp;binet, but merely a statement ofwhat he had said.   He should alsoindicate that, importance was attachedto the three points in paragraph 1,Whitehall hardens, S.&quot; ,1,October SS, 1988*
Hr* Walahe came to see me to-day for a &quot;personal talk&quot;.Ho said that he came with Mr. do Valera*8 knowledge and approval, though it was not to be understood that ho hadMj% de Valera*s authority for what he said.Ho was anxious to know whether I could give him mypersonal opinion that I did not think that an agreement onthe following linos would be impossible from the UnitedKingdom point of views(1) a settlement of the financial dispute ona fifty-fifty baslsj(2) acceptance of the settlement &quot;as a friendlysettlement ae between two Members of theCommonwealth&quot;;(3) an immediate trade agreement*He eiaphaeised that ho was not asking any statementfrom the United Kingdom Government and was not bringing anyoffer fr-osa Ut* do V&amp;iera.
