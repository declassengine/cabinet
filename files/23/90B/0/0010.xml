(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PRQPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S. GOVERNMBWT -)M Opt S^ai^fc&apos;. CAB I WET 56 (55) .THE ITAL0-A3YSSINIAN DISPUTE.GOVERNMENT POLICY IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE.Summary of Cabinet Discus-5ion on December 18,195^,at. 10 Downing Street, at11 a .m.-------------- \after arrangements had been made, as recorded inthe Cabinet Conclusions, for a Ministerial drafting committee to consider the preparation of an amendment to the Opposition Motion, THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggestedthat though the Cabinet could not draft resolutionsit might be useful to resume the discussion of theprevious day on broad lines.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out, that the foreign secretary was probably feeling on trial, and must beallowed to make his speech in his own way.   TheChancellor of the Exchequer in a few minutes would put the general lines of the Foreign Secretary&apos;proposed speech.   He. would have to point out thatwe had reached a position where it was essential toknow what other nations would do in the event of warand how far M. Laval was prepared to go in the eventof a sudden Italian attack.    That, he understood, wasone of the things that Sir Samuel Hoare would do.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER agreed that theForeign Secretary probably felt himself to be on histrial, though, of course, the Cabinet were with him.-1-
Si,.Sir Samuel Hoare was prepared to make his defence inParliament.   He had. not changed his mind, as to therightness of his action, although he was prepared to admit that, in view of public opinion, the Governmentcould not adhere to his plan.   He thought that theForeign Secretary had been greatly misled by his Staff,for when he had. left M. Laval he had been saluted byan attitude on the part of his Staff that this was agreat day for him.   That, perhaps, was the measure ofhis own tiredness, for he had been very exhausted atthe time and might easily in such circumstances have committed an error of judgment.   He would, have to try and make clear the conditions that had weighed withhim.    The Chancellor himself could, not, of course,undertake to repeat the Foreign Seci^etary&apos;s speech,but he would try and give the general lines .The Foreign Secretary would probably begin byexplaining his attitude of mind in the earlier stagesand emphasise his desire to avoid, a European war or anisolated, war between Italy and this country .   He had.been struck by the attitude he had. encountered, duringthe General Election that people did not wish to bebrought into war .   He would point out that there were two policies being pursued by the League, namely,(l) Sanctions,  (2) negotiation   both being pursuedsimultaneously.    The sanctions adopted so far had worked, rather better than had been expected, and this had led to a demand for stronger sanctions that wouldbe still more effective.     This had led to the proposedoil sanction, which brought us within the danger zone.The Foreign Secretary had received, reports from many directions that the application of an oil sanctionmight involve war by Italy against us.    It was not thatwe feared the results of such a war, but that if war
came it might well be a single-handed war with thiscountry.   He would then describe the atmosphere of paris, which had been full of talk of war.   He had feltthat if there were a risk of a hostile act against ushe must assure himself of the attitude of other countries.His impression had been that the war risk was so great,that he ought to consider the possibility of a peaceful settlement.The Foreign Secretary&apos;s next task would be to describe the proposed peace terms.   He could show thatthere was something to be said in their favour;    forexample, the three principles and their basis, whichwas similar to that of the Committee of Five;    alsothat it embodied certain principles that had. been accepts!earlier by Abyssinia.   Moreover, compared with signor mussolini&apos;s demands last June they were very favourable.He would, be able to say that there were many of thelo-proposals that he had not much liked, but that theywere the best that he could at the time get the french to agree to with a reasonable chance that Signor Kassoliniwould, discuss them.    That would bring him to a point which the public ought to be made to grasp.There were only two methods of making pea.ce:    either(l) a negotiated peace, or (2) a dictated peace.   force could, only be exercised if either we were strong enoughto exert it alone or had a definite and concrete arraiige-ment with other Powers .    The Foreign Secretary would beable to say that we might try and try for a negotis.tedpea.ce at the present time, but it would be impracticable to get it without giving something to the aggressor.That was the fault in the alternative to a dictatedpeace.    The Foreign Secretary would admit that thepeace proposals were dead, but would say that they were
S&apos;6the best that could, be got in the form of a negotiatedpeace   though, admittedly, they were not acceptable.We had. therefore to fall bach on sanctions .   Thiswas very&apos; dangerous.    The effect of sanctions wascumulative, and that was equally true of the existingrelatively mild sanctions. As they approached the pointof becoming effective there was always the danger ofan act of aggression.    The Foreign Secretary would.probably speak with the utmost frankness as to theposition M. Laval had taken up in the event of sanctions .Sanctions might mean war.   We were not prepared to engage in war alone and had to look round, and assureourselves on the position.    The actual situation wasthat no ship, no aeroplane or gun had been moved by anynation except ourselves .    .Ve alone had done all thatwc could.    The future, therefore, lay in the hands ofthe League.   Unless it was prepared to implement itsaction in putting on s8.netions, success could not beexpected.    So the whole position must be cleared up-.(As will be seen from what follows,the Chancellor of the Exchequerinterpolated at various points toamplify or explain with, moreprecision the points that he had made .)THE MINISTER OF HEALTH was apprehensive of a speech on those lines .THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION fearedthe effect of such a speech would be disastrous .Within the last ten days the newspapers had very ablyrubbed in the fact that arguments that were quite validfor refusing to embark on further sanctions could notbe used in support of so unsatisfactory a peace.The criticism would be made that the public had. beenlet in for this issue at the Election without beingtold what the real position was, and it would be
recalled that only two days before the Foreign Secretarywent to Paris he had reaffirmed that peace must be acceptable to both parties .   He thought this would endanger the future of the Government.    In reply to aquestion from the Prime Minister as to what argumentshe would use, lie said that he would use the arguments in the early part of the proposed speech to explain the difficulties of the situation;    but as regards Frenchpreparedness the only thing we could do was to mentionM. Lava.l&apos;s good will.   We ought not to say that ships and aeroplanes were not ready .THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out, however, that no-one had been ready except ourselves.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR agreed with the first part of the case as put by the Chancellor of theExchequer on behalf of the Foreign Secretary, but thought we ought not to conceal that we had been ableto assure ourselves that France was not ready to implement M. Laval&apos;s undertslcing.   His agreement inthe speech was on the assumption that it would be theForeign Secretary&apos;s speech on his own behalf, but noton that of the Government.    The Government were boundto admit that they regarded the Paris proposals as dead.They would never have approved negotiations on those lines if they had been asked to do so before the foreign secretary went to Paris;    nor could they ever agree in the Paris  Communique expressing satisfaction withthe terms.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES agreed in
The whole episode was staggering and demoralisingas far as the country was concerned, and everyone wastroubled about it.    The Government would get afavourable vote on the morrow, but there would be many abstentions.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the majority would fall to about 100.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES,continuing, said that Members would be going backto their constituencies to celebrate their victoryand would find themselves faced with disintegration.-5a-
THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES thought the proposed speech involved grave dangers to Europe.It might be a speech for a Member of Parliament to remember, but it would have a shattering effect inEurope.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said, and repeatedlater in the Meeting, that the Foreign Secretary wouldnot be entitled to say that no other nation was willingor ready to fight.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he ought tohave made clear that the Foreign Secretary did not propose to put forward any grievance against theFrench, but merely to state that the French were notprepared, to fight.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said, the French army were better prepared than we were.   He would, circulatesome information to the Cabinet on this subject.THE SECRETARY&quot; OF STATE FOR AIR said it was not somuch the state of preparedness for war, but the certainty that they would take action that was lacking.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA recalled that theCabinet had been told on Monday last that if they didnot endorse the peace terms they would be repudiatingtheir colleague.    In the circumstances he had feltthere was no option but to accept responsibility.Now that responsibility could not be repudiated evenif members of the Cabinet did not like it.   He himselfsaw no objection to the sketch given by the Chancellor-o-
of the Exchequer of the first part of the speech.The Foreign Secretary could say that he and M. Laval   -had been asked by the League to find a basis fordiscussion.    They had worked hard and had arrived ata proposal which was as far as the French were prepare!to go to meet our views .    But the proposal was onlyto be put to the League as a possible basis of discus-sion.    If the League came to the conclusion that theproposals were not in consonance with the Covenanthe could say that at least he and M. Laval had done their best, though they admitted that they had not been successful.    The differences between Abyssinia andItaly had been too grea.t for common ground to be found.That would be a perfectly intelligible statement.   Hewould not press the proposals and would submit them tothe League only as the best obtainable in the circumstances-stances of the moment.    Then would come up the questionof the result of the proposals .   Here the foreign secretary would, be on much more difficult ground.Were we going to press the suggestions before theLeague for further sanctions?   We were told that theymeant war.   He himself did not believe that Italy would go to war.   M. Laval had told Sir Samuel Hoare that itmeant war because Signer Mussolini had told this to theVetera.ns Associations of France and Italy.    That wassheer propaganda.    Signor Ivfussolini would never confidehis intentions to go to war to such a body.   He wasputting up a tremendous bluff.    It would strengthenSignor Mussolini&apos;s bluff if it were said that theseproposals had been made because we were afraid of Italy.He would be very surprised, if Signor Mussolini went towar.    Signor Mussolini would know that his operations in East Africa were then doomed, and that he himself would also probably be doomed.   Human judgment was liable
to err, but he hoped that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs would not stress the point that warmeant war against us alone.   We had received assurances from France, Yugo-Slavia, Greece and Turkey.    In factSir Samuel Hoare had said that M. Laval&apos;s assuranceswere better than he had hoped for.   We were told thatno-one but ourselves had made any preparations .   Whatpreparations did we expect the Turks and Greeks tomake?   Such forces as they had were on the spot.   he felt that we had to accept the assurances of thesenations.   Experts should, of course, do their best toascertain what was the value of their forces.   He urged,however, that it would be unwise to lay too much stress on the risk that if we took further sanctions we werein danger of isolated hostilities.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that destructive criticismwas always easier than to be constructive.    One pointhe felt was very grave from the point of view of theposition of the Foreign Secretary and the Government.He recalled the argument that there were only two formsof peace, the first negotiated, the other dictated,that we had tried the first, so that nothing was leftto us but the second.    It was next argued, he sa.id,that it was therefore no use to go on with sanctions and that we must put the whole matter to Geneva.    Thatwas a hopeless position to take up in Parliament.The one thing to nail the lid on the coffin would be tosay that we were not going on with sanctions on theground that other nations had made no preparations .THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER interpolated thathe had omitted the conclusion of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.   His logical conclusion was not tlatthat sanctions were hopeless .   His view was that we were forced back for the moment on to sanctions, the object
of which, was to get a better ground for a negotiatedpea.ce;    but we must not allow the other nations toadopt the position &quot;We put on the sanctions and youtake the consequences&quot;.   He would then press them totake the necessary precautionary measures, and hethought it not unlikely that they would do so.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he would rather likethe Foreign Secretary to stress the point that we intended to go on with sanctions.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that that wasthe effect of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s speech.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH recalled that no-one had yetsaid publicly that other nations v/ere not preparingthemselves to play their part.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR vVAR said there was no justification for any such statement. He knew of no evidence.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said itwould be very necessary to keep in line with theDominions on this.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that thepolitical situation was tragic.   He feared that theSecretary of State for India&apos;s proposals would not godown in the House of Commons.    It was essential toavoid (l) any suggestion that we were afraid of signor mussolini, and (2)  any justification of the proposed terms .   Anyone who took that line could only take it if he resigned.THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS thought that thespearhead of the attack would be the way the propositionwas presented to Abyssinia.   The only chance of gettingaway with the position successfully in the House ofCommons was to admit that a mistake had been made.
He recalled his own answers during the Election to thefirst of the questions put by the League of NationsUnion, as to whether he was prepared to resist thetriumph of force, to which he had given an affirmativereply .   He felt that the only way out was the lineproposed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies .THE HOME SECRETARY felt sure that the Secretary ofState for India&apos;s proposed speech would not stand the test of a House of Commons Debate.   He pointed to the telegram sent to Abyssinia urging the Emperor to adopta favourable attitude to the proposals.The Cabinet were reminded that this had been sentunder a Cabinet decision (Cabinet 52 (35) conclusion (e)).THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said he had not had the slightest idea that the telegram was to be made public.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had not referred,to this telegram for purposes of blame, but to showthat the Secretary of State for India&apos;s line wouldnot do in the House of Commons.    One difficulty he himself felt was the Foreign Secretary&apos;s attitude that he had not changed his mind that these proposals were right.   He personally could not agree that theproposals.were right, and could not defend them in the
House of Commons or elsewhere.   He felt that they werenot right.   What made matters worse we.s the secondargument, that in the Paris atmosphere of war theForeign Secretary had come to the conclusion that itwas necessary to make war by a negotiated peace.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER again interpolateda remark that it would be going too far to say that theForeign Secretary had come to the conclusion that warmust be avoided at the cost of a negotiated pea.ce.   Hisline rather was that the risks of war were so great thata vigorous effort must be made to avert it.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the view of the Houseof Commons was that there was no connection betweengoing slow in the matter of sanctions and pressingpeaceterms on the Emperor of Abyssinia.   He recalled that in his speech on September 11th the Foreign Secre-tary had said that we stood for the collective mamteianc eof the Covenant .   What he had dons was inconsistent withthat.   He reca.called the Manehurian episode and the LyttonCommission, which had recommended what it thought was practicable.   He could not accept, in the present ease,that the Cabinet should say that these peace terms were acceptable.   He then read the Motion on the Order Paper,as follows:-&quot;That the terms put forward by HisMajesty&apos;s Government as a basis foran Italo-A-byssinian settlement rewardthe declared aggressor at the expenseof the victim, destroy collective security, and conflict with the expressed will of the Country andwith the Covenant of the League ofNations, to the support of which the honour of Great Britain is pledged;this House, therefore, demands thatthese terms be immediately repudiated.&quot;This was very nearly what the Cabinet felt.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he had gathered from a telephone message that the Foreign secretary might accept that resolution.
THE HOME SECRETARY continued that another aspect of the proposed speech of which he could hardlyexaggerate the importance was that it was rewardingSignor Mussolini for his bluff and bluster.    It wouldbe said that the more a country bluffed and blusteredthe more it would get.The public were under the impression that the foreign secretary had gone out to Paris with instructions fromthe Cabinet to negotiate a peace.   This was not thecase.    The position would be improved if the Secretaryof Sts-te were to say that he went to Ps.ris not with instructions to negotiate, but that things devolped in this way and. that he had then sent the proposalshome.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES drew attention to the fact that the Secretary of State had approved the terms in the Communique, which read asfollows:-&quot;Animated by the same spirit of eon-cillation, and inspired by close Franco-British friendship, we have in the courseof our long conversations toda.y a.ndyesterday sought the formulas which might serve as a basis for a friendly settle-ment of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute.There could be no question at present of publishing these formulas.    The BritishGovernment has not yet been informed ofthem, and once its agreement has beenreceived it will be necessary to submitthem to the consideration of the inter-ested Governments and. to the decision ofthe Lea.gue of Nations.We have worked together with the sameanxiety to reach as rapidly as possible a pacific and. honourable solution.   Weare both satisfied with the results whichwe have rea.ch.ed.&quot;THE HOME SECRETARY recalled that the usual practiceat Conferences was to leave the Coimnunique. to be drafted
by officials, and he thought this had probably takenplace in Paris.   He thought, however, that the communique had been a grave error.THE PRIME MINISTER said he did. not wish to express a view at the Cabinet as he had not yet settled hisopinion.    All he could say was that though he was notrattled, it was a worse situation in the House of Commonsthan he had ever known.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL had come to the conclusionthat while it was possible to make a case against the worst attacks, this could not be done without admittinga mistake.    So far as the Government were concerned,he would like to make a plain statement of what had happened;    the difficulties of the Cabinet in view ofthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s absence and ill-health,  -BHe was affected by another consideration, namely, that much more was at stake, namely, the whole moral positionof the Government before the world.    If the PrimeMinister were to lose his persone.1 position, one ofour national anchors would have dragged.THE PRIME MINISTER said, he would stand or fall by what he said on the morrow.   He had found the present onv er s at ion very useful.&apos;^&quot; For the moment, ne would say nothing.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that whatever the Foreign Secretary were to say, he hoped, that hewould make up his mind to consider what would be theposition e^iLiK, Lr^ ^vuwcasiiJLi if- At. hx^cu^JL oa ^dfxd^ju^ SevieAvu^
7THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that after theMeeting of the Cabinet he was going to see the foreign secretary .   He had done something he had hardly everdone before and taken a few notes, as it was only fair to give him some account. - He felt sure that theForeign Secretary would give careful consideration tothe views expressed.    With, reference to the HomeSecretary&apos;s remark, as he had understood it, that theForeign Secretary was going to justify the proposalsso far as he himself was concerned   not on behalf ofthe Government   he thought that the Foreign Secretaryheld that the position was altered, by the fact thatthe proposals were dead. He was, however, bound to give his own reasons for his action.    It did not appear tothe Foreign Secretary, however, that he was committing the Government.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH hoped that he would, not fallback on the war argument to justify his statement.THE HOME SECRETARY said, the reason why he had. madethe statement the Chancellor of the Exchequer referredto was that if Sir Samuel Hoare as Foreign Secretarystated that he had not changed his mind in consideringthe proposals right, the Government were all exposed toa challenge, whereas he himself thought he had beenwrong in accepting the proposals .THE PRIME MINISTER then closed the discussion.2, Whitehall Gardens, S .W.1,December 18, 1935.
