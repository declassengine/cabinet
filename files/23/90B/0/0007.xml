M03T SECRET,21st September,  1951.I enclose a draft, from my Motes,  ofyour statement at the Cabinet this morning, as wellas of the First Sea Lord&apos;s.      It is ratherdifficult,in longhand notes, to summarise telegrams and memoranda that are readaLoud, but I tried tojot down the major points.The Right Hon.Sir Austen Chamberlain,K.G-. ,M.P.
(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT).MOST SECRET.(NO DISTRIBUTION:    TO BE PLACED IN SEALEDENVELOPE WITH THE STANDARD COPY OP THECABINET MINUTES, AFTER APPROVAL 3Y sir austen CHAMBERLAIN AND THE PRIME MINISTER).Summary of a Statement made by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (sir austen Chamberlain)  to theCabinet on Monday, 21stSeptember,  1931, at11 50 a.m.Sir Austen Chamberlain read to the cabinet a series of messages that he had received from theNaval Comraanders-in-Chiei&apos; at Plymouth, and Portsmouth,as well as a summary by the Director of Naval Intelligence,based partly on information from M.I.5* and summarising thesituation as to the cuts in naval pay.     A signal hadbeen intercepted from the Rodney to the Lord Nelson,on passage south fromInvergordon,  indicating that thelatter ship was to be the pivotal ship on Tuesday.      Thiswas interpreted to imply an intention to take action at -Pl^iuuffi similar to that taken at Invergordon theprevious week.      Portsmouth reported that propagandawas going on among the higher ratings, who had hitherto been loyal, and who were now being urged to resist the cuts in their pay.      This propaganda was already havingsome effect.      The situation at a^j^mou^h had been deemedby the commander-in-Ghief to be so serious on Sundaythat he had sent his chief-of-staff up to London to seethe First Sea Lord.      Since the ships had been in thehome ports it had been possible to obtain more information,
3rpartly from M.1.5.     All reports agreed that thesituation was extremely serious.      There was acomplete organisation on the lower deck to resist the cuts, and the petty officers were now affected.&quot;/arrant officers were unaffected.      The intentionnow was for the crews to walk out of the ships on tuesday morning,      Confidence had been lost in theAdmiralty and there was a certain amount of abuse ofnoliticians.      The only, report so far received Sromaabroad was from the H.M.S. Delhi on the West Indiessituation, which reported an incident when the seamen and marines had refused to turn to, butthe difficulty had been allayed and further trouble was not anticipated.During the meeting information wasreceived of a press report from Hong Kong, wheresome unrest was reported.   *^5se^Jc^ifProm agents&apos;  reports it was learnt thatit had been doubtful up to the last moment as towhether H.M.S. Nelson would sail last Wednesday.On the whole, however,  the^had thought that in thehome ports their position would be stronger Ve&amp;&amp;sa *sgosasSEPfeh.     The men thought that the civil populationof the ports was with them, but it was doubtful whetherthis was the case, at Plymouth at any rate.      Theoutbreak was purely naval and the Communists hadbeen rather taken by surprise.     Now, however, the communists were active in the ports and had sent someof their best agents there.      The men were reportedto object to cuts of 25$ when men&apos; doing nothing
were only cut 10^. The ranks and ratings who hadenlisted after 1925, and were unaffected, werestanding in with their comrades, who had enlistedbefore that year. The whole organisation of thelower deck was extremely thorough. The officersof the Fleet considered it essential to limit the cuts /^e3Pbasic r&amp;tebg^?^0r&apos;s^   9n the whole ^hewould happen if the gates were closed at the dockyard ports.      He was informed that the marinesafloat were implicated and that the marines at thehome ports were not to be trusted.      If the men were allowed to leave the dockyard and then the gates were closed against them there would probably be serious trouble and they might batter down the gates.      He had met the Sea Lords that morning and their recommendation was that the Government ought to announce that asthe result of enquiry the cuts should not be greaterthan 107-.     Whether that would be accepted now he couldnot say.      The men had been prepared for a cut, andhad expected as much as Gd.      The news of the extentof the cuts had been shattering.      These cuts fellmore heavily on the less well-paid men than on thosein receipt of better pay.      The reason was that whenthe rates had been re-arranged in 1^28,    a largercut had been made in the lower ranks in order to makea greater discrepancy between the .lower and the migher ranks and so to encourage men to take the responsibilitiesmen, -b*j4 ol CvOuroe did^not countenance-their methodsof ventilating thcar^Sir Austen Chamberlain had enquired what
for becoming petty officers.     There was something to be said for the plea of the men that allowances should not be taken into consideration in makingcuts on pay.     A ration allowance, for example,could not be used for families.      It had been abitter pill for all those responsible for controlling the Fleet to have to report that it was completelyout of hand.Sir Austen Chamberlain then read a draft ofa statement which he and the Sea Lords had preparedfor consideration.Admiral Field, who was asked by the PrimeMinister if he had anything to add to the FirstLord&apos;s statement, beyond confirming it only wishedto say that most of the evidence the Admiralty hadreceived came from the men first-hand.      The reports were that if the cuts did not exceed 10&quot;&quot; and if theywere reassured that the Navy was not to be treatedmore hardly than other members of the community, the cuts would be accepted.     At present they couldnot rely on the petty officers and marines tocontrol the situation.Sir Austen Chamberlain estimated that thecost of the proposed cuts would be  500,000 out of thetotal saving under this head of  1,^00,000.     TheAdmiralty recognisedthat the half million must be saved in some other way and would accept thatobligation.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.21st September, 19^1.if.
