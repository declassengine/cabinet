An estimate of the corresponding Britishfigures is given for purposes of comparison.GERMAN. BRITISH.(Scheme F.)Heavy Bombers    ) 230) 810Medium Bombers ) 750Torpedo Bombers - 32Dive Bombers 162 -Fighters 324 420Army Co-operation    ))      324 132Long Reconnaissance)General Reconnaissance ) 126)135Flying Boat ) 361,755 1,736In explanation the Secretary of State said thatDive Bombers were relatively sxiort-range machines intended for Army Co-operation.    General Milch had said that this programme showed the present intentions of the GermanGovernment, but it was, of&quot; course, always possible that
7/EINO)political considerations might lead to new programmes.Since then he had sent a message to say that if any changes were intended he would give us notfce of theGerman intentions.    The Air Ministry had, of course, done their utmost to test the genuineness of these figures,which v/as a difficult task.    The Germans had said thatthey were dissatisfied with many of their presentmachines, and that was confirmed by other information available to the Air Ministry.    General Milch had shown the Air Staff Mission types of their new machines, andhad implied that a complete re-equipment of the german air Forces was to be undertaken.    That was by no meansimprobable.    They had a greater manufacturing capacitythan we, and, in addition, some of the old machines wouldbe of value.    This, perhaps, did not apply so much to theFighters as to the Bombers.    The Air Staff, who were in abetter position than anyone else to assess these matters,had entered a caveat as to what the Germans could do ifthey decided to expand&apos;.    As to the genuineness of theGerman intentions, the information coincided sufficientlywith other available information as to indicate that itwas reasonably reliable.    There was no doubt, however,that they could increase their output rapidly, ifv necessary, as they possessed the factories for the/Kii. w        *_______......../     / ,4,-g purpose, to say nothing of the discarded machines. The6fcr*s 9r &apos; V, Germans were now taking more care than in the past in the^ivJ^viv-;.. training of their personnel, but by 1959 they would possess the necessary reserves for expansion, and this confirmed the Air Ministry&apos;s view (which was to be discussed at theDefence Policy and Requirements Committee on the morrow)that we ought to have ready a scheme for mobilia. ng full strength if necessary.(From this point on, the Secretary of State1sremarkls&quot;&quot;are recorded in&quot;&apos;the&quot;&quot;brdinary^lEnatesr- of the cabinet&quot;)February 3, 1937. &quot; ...
