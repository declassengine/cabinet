In view of the general financial situation, it is necessaryto adopt emergency measures to deal with the finance of theUnemployment Insurance Scheme, pending the Report of the RoyalCommission.     Any legislation to be passed for the purpose wouldbe of a temporary nature and would remain in force only for alimited period, say, until 31st July, 1932 (or 31st March, 1932).2.     As the outcome of discussions between the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer, and the Minister of Labour, thefollowing measures are submitted for consideration by the Cabinet.Saving in     Saving inBudget in     amount to be1931/32.Total   1saving inborrowed in        1931/32.1931/32.(Average live register .. 2,600.000).Rates of benefit.(a) a reduction of 2/- inthe adult dates of benefit(making the man&apos;s rate15/- and the woman&apos;s rate13/-) and l/- on juveniles.(b) a reduction of 2/- inthe rate for adult depen-darits, making it 7/-   .....Married women.(c) Restriction of benefitrights of married women ...Short-time &amp; intermittentworkers.(d) Restriction of benefitrights of short-time andintermittent workers, includ-ing week-enders ...........Seasonal workers.(e) Restriction of benefitrights of seasonal workersTOTAL SAVINGS IN 1931/32Million  .

3.     The reduced charges on the Budget are estimated on theassumption that Transitional Benefit Is continued at the cost of the^e Exchequer for another year and that contributions are not increased.     It will he observed that the direct saving to theExchequer if all the above changes were made would amount to 6 millions, of which the measures to deal with married women,short-time, intermittent, week-end and seasonal workers account for  2 millions.      In addition, there would be a saving in theamount to be borroed of  17-1- millions.4.     A far more striking saving could be secured in transitional benefit is not renewed.     It would effect a direct saving to theExchequer of  17^ millions in 1932-32.     The persons who havebeen in receipt of Transitional Benefit would have to be assisted,where necessary, by the Public Assistance -Authorities, and itmight be necessary to make an rdditional grant in certain cases to such authorities.     Even so, the net saving to the exchequer should not be less than  13,millions.     This saving is much thelargest that can be made in 1931-32 and does not require legislation (except in so far as legislation may be necessaryfor authorising grants to Public Assistance Authorities).5.      If contributions were increased by 2d. all round, theeffect would be to increase the charge on the Exchequer by 4 millions, which would cancel the saving to the Exchequer bythe suggested reductions in the rates of benefit, but on theother hand, it would reducs the amount to be borrowed by  12millions.6.     An additional reduction in the rate of transitional benefit, making the rate for men 13/- and that for women 11/-would save the Exchequer  3 millions, but would not affect theamount to be borrowed.7.     The following paragraphs make suggestions as to therestrictions to be imposed under heads (c) (d) and (e).
8.     (c) Married women.     Women on marriage would becomeineligible for benefit -(i) until they could show to the satisfaction of aCourt of Referees that they have been employedin an insured trade for a reasonable period since marriage; or(ii) (alternatively) until they have paid 30contributions since marriage and can satisfy aCourt of Referees that they are still normallyemployed in an insured trade.The second alternative is the one which should be adoptedif an effective check is desired.9-     (d) Short-time and intermittent workers.(i)   Persons whose earnings are at least halS their normal earnings (with safeguards for persons with small earnings)to be ineligible for benefit.This wnuld cover not only short-time workers, dockers, etc.but workers of all kinds.(ii) (alternatively)   Persons working regularly for thesame employer three days a weak to receive only one day&apos;benefit, working two days a week to receive only 2 days&apos; benefit,and working one day a week to receive only three, days1 benefit(i.e. in each case two days benefit less than at present).Those working alternate weeks to be treated as if working three days a week.The rule would have to be so phrased as to cover the caseof dockers.(iii) (alt international iy ely)    Continuity rule to be altered to read that any four days of unemployment (instead of three daysas at present) in six consecutive days would be treated ascontinuous unemployment, and the present 10 weeks1 &quot;bridge&quot; tobe reduced to 6 weeks, as it was formerly.For short-time working this would mean that a personworking each week would in general be ineligible for benefit-3- /if
3oif employed on three days or more; but persons working &quot;week on and week off&quot; would still be eligible as at present, and thechange might therefore be ineffective so far as such working isprac iicahle.The change would have a considerable effect in the caseof dockers.10.      (f) Seasonal workers to be ineligible for benefit during their &quot;off-season&quot;, unless they satisfy a Court of Refereesthat they have during the past two years worked for at least30 weeks in insured employment during their &quot;off-season&quot;.Borrowing powers.11.     The present excess of outgoings over income of the fund is about  1,000,000 a week.      If all the changes mentioned inparagraph 2 were made this would he reduced to about  650,000a week;    or, if in addition there were an increase of contri-butions as mentioned in paragraph 5, to about  400,000 a week.The point is not affected by the action taken as regardstransitional benefit (paragraphs 3, 4 and 6.)IE.     Q?he present borrowing powers of  70,000,000 will be exhausted at the beginning of March.,     A further  20,000,000on an average live register of 2,600,000, would be exhaustedas follows:-(i) If no changes are made ......... by mid-July.(ii) If changes in paragraph 2 aremadeby end of Septanber.(iii)If changes in paragraph 2 aremade and in addition increasedof contributions as inparagraph 5...................by December.(Initialled)M. 6. B.5th February. 1931.
