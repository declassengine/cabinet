&quot;iHSSICE (1)    With reference to War Cabinet 491 A. Minute 4, the$ GER-War Cabinet had some further discussion on the subject ofjterpreta-   where the initiative lay for taking the next step in theion of&apos; hdent      negotiations with regard to Germany.    In this connectionIson&quot; stest,Note, they had before them telegram No.4812, from Washington,enclosing the text of an official Note from the Secretaryof State, dated October 23, formally enclosing the commun-modifications which had passed between the United States Gov-emment and the German Government, and specially invitingan expression from the British Government as to its will-ingness and readiness to acquiesce and take part in thecourse of action with regard to an armistice proposed inthe last Note to Germany.    It was generally agreed thatthis Note did not finally clear the matter up, and thatthere would be no useful purpose served in further discus-sion until the Prime Minister and his colleagues had dis-cussed the ms,tter with Colonel House.The War Cabinet decided that:-The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should send a provisional reply to Washington .in the sense that an answer would be givenafter the forthcoming discussions at Ver-sailles and Paris.SSIDENT (al With reference to War Cabinet 491 A. Minute 6, Mr.JSOB1 sfmw        Chamberlain asked whether the Secretary of State for For-pwjs.eign Affairs had taken any step to give effect to the de-sdom ofSeas.       oision of the previous day.Mr. Balfour said that the draft which he had read tothe War Cabinet yesterday had dealt only with the conditionsof peace omitted from the Presidents Fourteen Points.   he recalled that, during the discussion on the previous day.Lord Curzon had raised the question of the Freedom of these as, and suggested that some caveat should be uttered in
regard to it.    In fact, Lord Curzon had pointed out thatthe Fourteen Points contained errors of omission as wellas of commission.   Mr. Balfour had, therefore, prepared an addition to his original draft dealing with the questionof the Freedom of the Seas.The Prime Minister said that Before Mr. Balfour readhis draft, the question should &quot;be considered as to whethera telegram should be sent at all.    If all the Allies would agree on a joint declaration it would be much better thana separate declaration by the British Government.,   Hethought, therefore, the best plan would be to circulate aMemorandum on the subject at Versailles rather than tosend a telegram now.Lord Curzon agreed that it would be advisable, ifpossible, to get all the Allies to consent to a joint de-olaration.    Our object was to put our view perfectly clear-ly on recordo    The question arose, however, as to whether our Allies would consent to associate themselves jbaa ourview.The Prime Minister thought that -3 out of the 4 allies would do so.Mr. Balfour mentioned that he had heard rumours thatthe French had had conversations with the Americans on thesubject of the Freedom of the Seas, and it was possible we might find these two nations opposed to us.Sir Eric Geddes described an interview he had had in new York with an Irishman, who, though a Sinn Feiner, waspro-British as opposed to the Germans, and who had been recommended to him as trustworthy by Sir William WisemanoThis gentleman had told him that intimate conversations had,in fact, taken place at Washington between the French andcertain rather anti-British individuals in the entourage
of the President, and that eventually we might find our-selves let down by these Allies on the questions of theFreedom of the Seas and the Colonies.    Che First lord had told the Irishman to report what he had said to Sir Wil-liam Wiseman, and had not given him any hint as to whatview he took of his remarks.    This information, however,appeared to square closely with that given &quot;by Mr. Balfour,Mr. Chamberlain reminded his colleagues that he had pressed yesterday that a telegram should be sent givingplain expression to our views on the Freedom of the Seas.He Yfas now quite in agreement that it was essential to dis-ouss these subjects at Versailles, but nevertheless hethought that the information communicated by Mr. Balfourand Sir Eric Geddes made it all the more important to send a telegram at the present stage, at any ra,te to the Frenchand Italian Governments, and, perhaps, to the American Gov-ernment also.adMr. Balfour then read the HEsditions to his draft telegram, which were based on the idea that we might statethat we could not agree to the doctrine of the Freedom ofthe Seas until the league of Nations had proved itself tobe an effective instrument.Lord Curzon pointed out that President Wilson had as-*soelated the idea of the League of Nations with the doe-trine of the Freedom of the Seas0    He would undoubtedlye.rgue that the two could not be dissociated.(GENERAL HABINGPON entered at this point).Mr. Chamberlain said that he did not know exactly how the League of Nations was to operate.   What he wished toknow was why the effectiveness of sea warfare was to belimited when that of land warfare was not.
The Prime Minister pointed out that if the League ofNations was effective there would he no wars, and the ques-tion would not arise.    He himself agreed with Mr. Chamber-lain that he could see no difference between sea warfare and land warfare.   President Wilson1s proposals reallyamounted to the taking of measures to render sea power in-effeotive in a way that he did not render land power in-effective.   We ought to state quite definitely that wecould not associate ourselves with this doctrine.    Publicopinion in this country would never stand any faltering onthe question.    He felt, however, that it was very difficultto say it in a telegram without giving offence to the Pres-idento    By saying it in a speech you could use all sortsof diplomatic and friendly&apos; phrases, and so render it innoc-uous without losing the force of what you wished to say.Lord Curzon said it depended a good deal what wouldbe the attitude of the other Powers in the ConferencesSir Eric Geddes said that he did not think PresidentWilson wished really to press the Freedom of the Seas very strongly.    He wished to leave it somewhat vague.    In his view the President was rather bitten with the effectiveness of sea power, and this view was supported by the fact thathe had now gone to Congress for a greatly increased Navy.He probably wished, under the League of Nations, to take alarge share in the policing of the seas,(LORD HEALING entered at this point).Mr. Balfour said that the position diplomaticallywas one of great difficulty.   At Versailles the problem would be for us, in discussing the question of an armistice,not to commit ourselves too deeply on the question of theFourteen Points.    The President had definitely committedhimself in the Fourteen Points to Freedom of the Seas.   Mr.Balfoux agreed with the First lordrs idea of what was in
th\e President*s mind.    He then referred to some notes giv-en Him &quot;by Sir William Wiseman on the subject of the Free-dom of the Seas, these notes containing the same idea asis expressed in his own draft telegrannGeneral Smuts said that the best way in which we could help President Wilson to get out of his difficulty was bytalcing a fairly strong line.Sir Eric Geddes suggested that the exclusion of allmention of the Havy in President WilsonIs Notes to germany might be connected with this question of the Freedom of these as.    He thought the President might agree to Germany hav-ing to hand over all her submarines, but not to her hand-ing over her large surface craft.    The President-had made it clear that he was nervous lest the Naval and military commanders should ask excessive terms, and he looked to thePolitical Representatives at the forthcoming Conference to check them.   Now that the President had realised what seapower meant, he did not wish the German Navy to be diminish-ished. too far, as he wished it to form a part of the in-ternational naval police force which he wanted to be alarge one0Lord Reading said he had always been apprehensive of what the Americans meant by the term &quot;Freedom of these as.&quot;   He had a strong suspicion that Colonel House in 1915.had committed himself at Berlin on the subject, although we did not know exactly how far.    Colonel House was undoubt-edly enamoured of this question, which he believed in someway to be his ovm creation.   We ought, therefore, to makep i&apos;V&quot;&quot;i!&quot;&apos;      &quot;it perfectly plain that we ought not to accept something which Germany, America, and France had discussed.   Wheneverhe had raised the question with Colonel House, the latter
had shown himself Illusive. The President had never dis-cussed it at all with him, hut he believed that PresidentWilson agreed with Colonel House. We might get PresidentWilson out of his difficulties comparatively easily by insisting that the Freedom of the Seas should only become operative if we had an effective league of Nations.Mr. Chamberlain mentioned as having a possible bear-ing on this subject that a short time ago he had receiveda letter from Mr. Crosby, asking whether some of the mat-erial demanded by the British Government in connection withthe work of the Inter-Allied Committee was not connectedwith construction of a post-war battleship, in which it wasmade perfectly clear that the Americans would not furnishany material for such a purpose.The Prime Minister pointed out that the most impres-sive fact in the War had been the overwhelming superiority of the British Navy.   While our Allies recognised its valueit also somewhat alarmed them.lord Reading said, in view of this discussion, he proposed to proceed to Paris tomorrow to discuss the matter with Colonel House.The Prime Minister then summed &quot;up the case againstsending a telegram.   First he saw no advantage in it.   Pres-Ident Wilson would not receive it until Sunday evening, andwould not have time to take any action in regard to it be-fore the Conference.   Baron Sonnino would be leaving Rometonight and might not even receive it before he started.He felt it would be a great advantage to wait until we knew the atmosphere of the Conference.   When we had appreciat-ed this we could find arguments that would appeal collect-ively to the Conference, or to individual Members of it.There were two ways of dealing with the questions-
(i) To say that the doctrine of the Freedom of these as was not acceptable to us, but that wewould be willing to debate it at the PeaceConferencesor(ii) To say that this must be eliminated and wecould not even discuss it.The advantage of the first method was that perhaps it would help the Presidents feelings.lord Reading ashed if it would be possible to debate the question?The Prime Minister said his own view was that we shouldchallenge the doctrine of the Freedom of the Seas altogether0Mr. Chamberlain suggested that we should say we arerootedly opposed to the Freedom of the Seas, but that we didnot know what the President meant by itQ   In some form we ought to say that we do not accept either the German inter-pretation of the doctrine, or the interpretation generallyput on it.   Moreover9 we should say it unambiguously.   what he was afraid of in going into a Conference to discuss itwas that it would be wrapped up in smooth words to soothethe feelings of others, and that we should come out of theConference with the question as ambiguous as before.    If we decided not to put in a telegram on the subject, then aMemorandum ought formally to be put in at some stage of theConference.Mr0 Bonar law thought it would be a mistake to take any action now.   We should first ascertain what France andItaly felt on the subject.    The Prime Minister should en-deavour to get some support he at the Conference, but ifhe could not he should then make our view quite clear.    Inregard to the question of the Freedom of the Seas, his ownfeeling was that we should adopt the principle that we would limit sea power exactly to correspond to the manner in whichland power is limitedo
1 9 k r\...... i. ,JMr. Balfour pointed out the essential difference be-tween sea warfare and land warfare.   All land was undersomeDody/s jurisdiction, whereas the sea outside the threemile limit was neutral.    He pictured the position at theConference as a difficult one.    All our Allies were grate-ful for our sea power, hut were afraid of it.    The tradition of all Continental juries had been that naval internationallaw was made to suit our sea power.    They had always tried to limit it, first at the Conference at Paris in 1856, and later at the Conference at London.   Moreover, all the per-manent officials in the Chancelleries, who had great influ-enoe, were opposed to us on this point.Sir Eric Geddes ashed if there was any doubt what so-I ever in the minds of all those who would be represented atthe Conference in regard to Great Britain11 s view on thisquestion?   Once we entered into conversations on the subjectwe should be committed to talking on it, whereas, if we made our point of view perfectly clear before the Conference, alldoubt would be removed.General Smuts said that he was of opinion it would bebetter not to send a telegram no?/.    If a written document was necessary it could be presented at the end of the Con-ference.The War Cabinet decided thats-The Prime Minister and Mr. Balfour should makeit perfectly clear to the Conference that we donot accept the doctrine of the Freedom of these as, and that a notification to this effectmust be made in some form to Germany before we entered into peace negotiations.   The method bywhich this should be carried out was left tothe discretion of the Prime Minister and Mr.  .Balfour after they had discovered the views ofother Allies and the general atmosphere of theConference on the subject.js5^ILI!ET     (3) With reference to War Cabinet 491 A. Minute 9, the0J1 AN ARMIST--    War Cabinet resumed the discussion commenced on the previous
day on the question of whether the British representatives at the forthcoming Conference should base their attitude on the assumption that we desired immediate peace or tocontinue the War.Mr. Chamberlain reminded his colleagues that, on theprevious day, he had expressed the view that the answer was that we ought to accept a good peace if we could get it at the present time, that Mr. Bonar law had agreed withhim, and that Lord Curzon had agreed in principle, but had pointed out that it depended on the interpretation given tothe term &quot;a good peace.&quot;   His own feeling, on reconsider a-tion, was that much depended on the position of the states to the East of Austria and Germany; on whether Germany was able to get a grip of these States 3 and whether we couldprevent it.    His own feeling was that the longer the Warlasts the weaker these minor States would become.The Prime Minister pointed out that there was an import-ant school of thought,which at times made considerable appealto him,who said that we ought to go on until Germany wassmashed; that we ought to force our way on to German soil,and put Germany at our mercy; that we should actually dic-tate terms on German soil, very possibly such terms as wewould now accept; but that the enemy should be shown that war cannot be made with impu^nityo    He felt that this pre-liminary question ought to be cleared up in our own mindsbefore the forthcoming Conference with our Allies.Mr. Balfour said that he himself would not go on withthe War if we could now get the terms which he thought oughtto be got.    These terms would include the loss of territory in Schl&amp;swig Holstein   (a point which had hitherto es-caped observation) - as well as territory to the West ofGermany of the most valuable kind from an aggressive point
of view, since it contained coalfields and ironfields, and.on the East territory containing coalfields which had belong-ed. to Germany since the time of Frederick the Great.    Bythese terms the Eastern frontier of Germany would be within70 miles of Berlin,,    By these terms Germany would lose herColonies.    If these conditions oould be secured it would beludicrous to say that Germany was not beaten.    She factthat our Armies were across the Rhine and had perhaps sack-ed Frankfurt would not really mean greater defeat to Germany,The Prime Minister said that industrial France ha.dbeen devastated and Germany had escaped.    At the first mo-ment when we were in a position to put the lash on Germany1sback she said, &quot;I give up..&quot;   The question arose whether we ought not to continue lashing her as she had lashed France.Mr0 Chamberlain said that vengeance was too expensivein, these days.The Prime Minister said it was not vengeance but justice.Mr. Balfour read an extract from President Y/ilson^sconversations with Sir William Wiseman, in which he had stat-ed that he would be ashamed If any American troops destroyeda single German town.Mr. Bonar Law said his view was the same as Mr. Balfour^SoLord Curzon said that Mr. Balfour had said he was per-perfectly clear about the conditions that must be imposed upon germany.    He himself laid great stress on including in theseconditions the repair of the damage wrought to Belgium andFrance.    He attached vital importance to the imposition of conditions which would render Germany impotent to renew theWar.    On this point we must have secure guarantees-    Henoticed that it was from this point of view that, the Uavyasked for the German Fleet, although he expressed no viewhimself in regard to this.   What he was afraicj. of was lestlie
Germany should  be left with, power to resume her nefariousplans, and lest she might be able to &quot;build up her power a  to force her way eastwards.    In the wreckage of all oivilisa-tion end order in the Hast, he was apprehensive lest Germany,with her population humiliated,but not cowed by her defeat,might once more assert supremacy.The Prime Minister said that in his mind he had summed up lord curzon&apos;s views as favouring a good peace, if itcould be secured now.Sir Eric Geddes said he did not want to get on Germansoil, he did not see that we could justify it, but he would insist on the surrender of so much of Germany1s naval andmilitary power as to reduce her to a second-class Power.The Prime Minister summed up this view as he had summed up lord curzon&apos;s.General Smuts said he had placed his views on Paper(GoTo6091).    In this he had pointed out that peace made atthe present time would be a British peace.    We had now got into our hands everything of material importance that we re-ourquired;/communications were secure, as was our supply of rawomaterial.    By fighting for twelve months more we should getnothing more.   Sa Were we, he asked, to continue the War forthe advantage of a Central Europe?   The longer we continued the greater he believed would Germany1s chance be of once more getting on top.    In this War the weaker nations had gone to the wall   Russia, Eoumania, Austria.    In a contin-continuance of the War, Europe would break up into a number of smallnominally free nations.    The only powerful unit on the Con-continent would be Germany.    All Germany1s rivals would dis-appear.   In the anarchy and revolution that would follow theWar, the strong hand of G-ermany would prevail.    Hence, he did not see what was to be gained by pushing matters too fare
If we were to beat Germany to nothingness, then we must beatEurope to nothingness, too.   As Europe went down, so america would rise.    In time the United States of America woulddictate to the world in naval, military, diplomatic, andfinancial matters.    In that he saw no good.lord Reading said he did not want to repeat what hadalready been said.    He would desire a good, peace, but witha special view to security for the future.    On this pointhe felt that we should be no more secure beoause we hadinvaded Germany and inflicted damage.   As regards America,he took exactly the same view as General Smuts,    Every month the War continued increased the power of the United States,which was gradually mobilising an enormous strength.   Atpresent it was in the main America and the British Empirethat were dominating the situation, and we were in a posi-tion to hold our own.    There were, however, influences,and important influences, in the United States which weregetting the idea that America should dictate the conditions0Hence, by continuing the War it might become more difficult for us to hold our own.The War Cabinet agreed that:-The Prime Minister and Mr. Balfour should, in theforthcoming Conferences at Paris, base their atti-tude on the question of an armistice on the assump-tion that the British Government desires a goodpeace if that is now attainable.thep COH- (4) Sir Eric Geddes drew/attention of the War Cabinet tofours offffiMIST-    G.To 6042, in which the Board of Admiralty had stated thenaval conditions of an armistice.The Prime Minister asked how article 1. which demandedthe surrender of all enemy submarines, compared with the versailles conditions?Admiral Wemyss said that Versailles had only suggested the surrender of 60 submarines.    This figure had been based
on the assumption that 60 was the maximum number at one time which would be able to put to sea.Sir Erie Geddes said that every effective submarineought, in the opinion of the Board of the Admiralty, to be interned.The Prime Minister asked why this was included as acondition of armistice?   It appeared to bim to pertain iaarather to the conditions of peace.Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that during an armistice theenemy would be able to repair all their submarines and tocome out in great force if the peace negotiations failed.He understood, moreover, that it was desired that theterms of an armistice should reflect the terms of a peace.The Prime Minister said this was the idea as regardsland warfare.    There was, however, a difference in regardto sea warfare.    There was nothing humiliating to Germany insurrendering Alsace-Lorraine, which was not really part ofthe Fatherland, and the same applied to the Erentino.   the surrender of ships, however, would be so humiliating as tomake an armistice impossible.    He pointed out that it had now definitely been decided that he and Mr. Balfour were toendeavour to secure a good peace, and this was a prohibitivecondition.Sir eric Geddes pointed out we could now say we hadpractically beaten the High Sea Fleet, since we had heldit in complete impotence.    The same did not apply to submarine-ines, but the submarine was a particularly nefarious weapon.He saw great difficulties in separating the terms of an arm-istice from the terms of peace.The Prime Minister ashed whether, if the enemy wereto concede all the terms we laid down for an armistice on land, we were to decline to agree if he would not concede the naval terms?   He ashed whether the Admiralty could notabate their terms?&apos;h
Six Eric Geddes said that even as regards submarinesthe enemy would not be able to hand over all he possessed.A submarine spent roughly two-thirds of its time refitting,so that a number would be laid up and unfit to go.to seaQSt might be possible to bring the naval terms more into line with the military by laying down that the enemy shouldhand over all submarines fit to go to sea    The whole ques-ontion really depended/whether we were going to disouss ordictate the terms of the armistice.    He pointed out that,in discussing these matters with our Allies, each invariablytried to include all its terms, so that they tended to out&quot;bid one another.    In this connection he read the Frenchterms.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out the uselessness of includ-ing, as the French had done in the terms of an armistice,limitations of what was going on in the enemy1s dockyardSoWe had no means of preventing this0Sir Eric Geddes said that we might lay down that acertain proportion, say, from one-third to HKSSchalf of the submarines should be surrendered.Admiral Wemyss pointed out that the British Governmenthad always contended that the manner in which submarines were used was illegal.    If we were to treat ai it as a legalmethod of war we might get ourselves into great difficulties.That was why the Admiralty insisted on the surrender of the submarines.Sir Eric Geddes said that we ought to settle the ques-tion of principle whether the armistice was to be discuss-ed only from the point of view of the terms for a cessation of hostilities, or from the point of view of influencing a peace.    The First Sea lord*s point really concerned peacerather than armistioeo
Mr. Balfour suggested, that we should take over and des-troy the enemy* s submarines, on the ground that they usedthem in an illegitimate manner.    We might treat the Fleetdifferently, since it had not Been used in any illegitimateway.    Of course, he would like to have the surface shipsas well, as otherwise, after the War, we shotild have tobuild more capital ships, since the German battle cruiserswere better than ours.lord Curzon pointed out that the British public wouldenemyexpect us to insist on the handing over of the/submarines.He would like to see an agreement jtefcfetefegi; negotiated aspart of the terms of peace that submarine warfare was abol-ished.The Prime Minister agreed, except attack on warships.Admiral Wemyss contended that it would pay the Britishto abolish submarine warfare altogether.Sir Eric Geddes again raised the question of princeple as to whether the terms of the armistice were to be treatedsimply from the point of view of the cessation of hostilit-ies or from the point of view of influencing the peace.Mr. Chamberlain suggested that the surrender of shipsmight he treated on the same footing as indemnities as partof the terms for which we should take a gauge as security.The Prime Minister pointed out that Marshal Poch had proposed to get some territory in hand asx security, for ex-ample, the Valley of the Saar.    He agreed with Mr. Chamber-lain that a gauge might he held until the Germans had handedover their Fleet, and if this was so the terms of the arm-istioe should be drawn up on the assumption that they were merely to provide for cessation of hostilities on favourableoonditionsoSir Eric Geddes said if this was the basis he did not
feel that lie could press as part of the terms of an armist-ice the handing over of the German battleships and cruisers.Mr. Balfour pointed out that the question was compli-communicated by the fact that the handing over of the German Havywas not included in President Wilson1s Fourteen Points, andif we entered a Peace Conference without making our position clear on these subjects, we might be unable to include themeasures for dealing with the German Kavy.The Prime Minister said that if the German battleshipsand cruisers were included in the terms of an armistice weshould have to make up our mind to continue the War0    he asked General Harington whether, from the information hehad as to the conditions of the German Army, we could expectthem to concede such conditions.General Harington replied in the affirmative.    In his view the German Army was in such a state that they might accept very harsh terms for an armisticeQMre Bonar law reminded his colleagues that the feelingourof the country before the War had been that/great danger wasthe German attempt to rival us at sea.    To beat Germany andnot get rid of this rivalry would open the Government to heavy criticism.The Prime Minister said the enemy would never accept this as part of the terms of an armistice.    He asked if Mr&quot;.Bonar lav/ was px-prepared to prolong the War to secure this?Sir Eric Geddes drew attention to Admiral Beatty*s Mem-memorandum which had been placed on the table sf at the meet-ing (Go To 6107).    He suggested that the War Cabinet should read the Memorandum.The Prime Minister said, that Admiral BeattyTs views hadbeen so admirably expressed when he attended the War Cab-inet, that he thought it unnecessary to read his Memorandum.

He suggested that the War Cabinet should read the Memorandum.The Prime Minister said that Admiral Bea,ttyTs views hadbeen so admirably expressed when he attended the War Cab-Inet8 that he thought it unnecessary to read his Memorandum.
Sir Maurice Eankey said the only new point was in re-gard to the Baltic, which., in a private letter to him, Ad-miral Beatty said we ought to open.Mr. Ohamherlain said that he thought we ought to fighton in order to disable the German Navy.    The exact numberof ships required to satisfy this condition was a matter to be determined.    He himself, however, looked with horrorto the day when, after an armistice had been declared, ahuge Yote of Credit was asked for in parliament in order tobuild up the Fleet against Germany.General Smuts said that the question was really nota legitimate one for an armistice, but was part of the termsof peace.Bord Beading suggested that,&apos; in stating the terms ofan armistice, we should make it clear that the question ofthe reduction of German naval power was one that we shouldbe bound to bring up as part of the terms of peace.Mr. Bonar lav/ pointed out that President Wilson had said that the terms of an armistice must be such as to pre-vent the enemy from fighting again.    Therefore, from thispoint of view, it was desirable to include the surrender ofthe battleships and cruisers.Mr. Balfour said that when he pictured the First lordcoming down to the House of Commons and saying that theGerman battle cruisers were &amp;e better than our own, and con-sequently that he must ask for a new Construction programme,he felt bound to at as abandon his previous view in favourof iteaxjteg taking the German submarines but leaving toGermany her Fleet.Mr. Bonar lav; pointed out that we should have in our hands some gauge to be used for the exaction of indemnities
Of;which might also he used to secure the abolition or reduc-tion of the German Fleet,Lord Curzon pointed out that the gauge would prob-ably be held by French and not by British troops.The Prime Minister pointed out that if the gauge con-sisted of territory west of the Rhine, France would not bein any hurry to give it up, &quot;but would only be too glad ofan excuse to retain it.Mr. Bonar Law said that it was essential to have an understanding with our Allies that one of the terms onwhich we must insist before the gauge was handed over wasthe surrender of the main part of the German FleetoThe Prime Minister said it would be essential to haveBritish as well as French troops in occupation of the terri-tory taken as a gauge.Mr. Balfour raised the question as to whether the Ger-mans would have any greater objection to the inclusion ofthe surrender of their Fleet in the terms of an armisticethan they would have in the terms of peace.The Prime Minister said that it would not be nearly sohumiliating if included only in the terms of peace.    Therewas a great difference in handing over weapons on the con-conclusion of peace and handing them over as part of an armist-ioe.Sir Brie Geddes drew attention to a formula referred toby President Wilson in conversation with Sir William Wise-man, namely:-,fIf the Germans are thoroughly beaten they will accept any terms; if they are not beaten, we don*t want themto accept terms.&quot;If this was correct, the Fleet ought to be handed over aspart of the terms of an armistice0The Prime Minister pointed out that this formula wasa very crude one, as there were stages in the extent to
which an enemy might be beaten.General Harington pointed, out that the Chief of theImperial General Staff, in his Memorandum on the terms ofan armistice (G.T.6087), had suggested that the German army should be granted &quot;Honours of War&quot;, that is to say, theyshould march out with their rifles but leaving behind guns,. trench mortars, machine-guns, &amp;c.,Admiral Wemyss said that the Havy would be prepared togive corresponding &quot;Honours of YTar&quot; to the crews of theships.Lord Curzon raised the question as to whether british public opinion would stand Germany not admitting defeat at sea to the same extent as she admitted it, by the terms towhich she submitted, on land. He also ashed if Heligolandought not to be taken as a gauge?Admiral Wemyss said that Heligoland was not really agauge at all, since, if the peace negotiations broke down,our forces would be marooned there and be very difficult torevictual.After some further discussion, the War Cabinet approved!-The following formula suggested by Lord Curson asthe basis for the Prime Ministers and Mr. Balfoufsnegotiations in Paris on the subject of a naval arm-istices-The naval conditions of the armistice should re-present the admission of German defeat by sea inthe same degree as the military conditions recog-nise the corresponding admission of German defeatby land.(5)   The War Cabinet decided thats-I LORD      iM:   The First Lord of the Admiralty should accompanyfSESD. the Prime Minister and Mr. Balfour to the MeetingJ50ELFER- Of the Supreme Y/ar Council in order that he mightbe present for the subjects of  The ITaval Conditions of an Armistice,andThe Freedom of the Seas.
O C- rfglTOFS        (6)    General Harington, at the request of the PrimeMinister, gave his views as to the present military sit- .reflationtie Gener-uation of the German Army.   He admitted that our own Army(taff.was extended to the full and was the only Army fighting pro-perly.    The Prenoh Army was extremely tired and was,soto speak, leaning against the enemy,only advafre&amp;ng whenthe enemy gave way.    She Asmerican Army was not in a much better situation.   On the other hand, from all the in-formation we had, it was clear that some portions of theGerman Army were in such a had state that anything might happen.    It was true the weather might give the enemy somerespite,    nevertheless, the German Higher Command must be extremely anxious about the state of their troops, andmight be willing to accept very stiff terms of an armist-ice.The War Cabinet decided that:-General Harington should cause the General staff to prepare and circulate, for the use of theBritish delegates at the Paris Conference, a Mem-memorandum giving an appreciation of the militarysituation and all available information regardingthe German Army.KITIES       (7) Mr. Chamberlain said that the Economic Defence and&apos; 1EPABA-1 Development Committee had given some consideration to thequestion of the manner in which the enemy should pay indemnity-nities and reparation to Belgium.    It had been pointed outthat if the indemnity was paid in kind, Belgium would bestocked with German machinery, German engines, and Germanrails; when spare parts were required they would naturallyget them from Germany, who would thus secure an economi ohold over the whole country.    It was felt, therefothe indemnity must be paid in some other form, egold, shipping, or foreign stocks and bonds.Mr. Bonar law said that Germany had not enoiaio
to pay for Belgium alone.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to havethe question examined in the Treasury.(8) Mr. Balfour, at the request of the prime Minister,undertook that:-The Foreign Office, before the forthcoming Confer-ence, should undertake an examination of PresidentWilson&quot;s speeches referred to in his Notes to Germany,in order to ascertain whether there were any moredoubtful points besides the Freedom of the Seas andthe clause dealing with economic considerations whichwere either ambiguous or harmful to the interestsof this country.(9) With reference to War Cabinet 491 A. Minute 3, thefirst Sea lord stated that Admiral Hope had telegraphedthat Admiral Gauchet had asked leave to go to Salonicaas there were movements of troops taking place there, anda new French Admiral had just been appointed.   Admiral DeBon had stated that he would only be allowed to go withthe concurrence of the British Admiralty.    It was now set-tied that, if the Allies were to go up the Dardanelles,Admiral Calthrop, with his four ships, should go first,and should be followed by Admiral Annaye with his force.Admiral De Bon had also given orders that Admiral Gauchetwas not to Interfere in any way with Admiral Calthrop.Sir Eric Geddes said that the Italians also wished to cooperate in going up the Dardanelles.The War Cabinet decided that:-The First lord and First Sea lord should have authority to arrange, at the Allied Naval Council,that the Italians should form a third force tofollow the French up the Dardanelles.(10) The First lord informed the War Cabinet that the delegates of the Turkish Government were expected at Mit-ylene tomorrow0
(11) The First Sea Lord raised the question as to v/heth-er any further instructions should he sent to Admiral. Cal-throp as^authorising him to state that England would useI her influence to leave Constantinople in Turkish hands andthat Turkey should frmirert exist as a sovereign State.As the telegrams sent to Berne had been repeated to admiral Calthrop, the War Cabinet decided thats-Ho further action was necessary.IrEBY. (12) With reference to War Cabinet 491 A. Minute 7, LordIrms of an   Curzon recalled that, on the previous evening, the Warjmistice.Cabinet had been on the point of deciding that no altera-tion should be made in the instructions sent to Admiral Cal-the   &apos;throp in regard to/terms of an armistice he was to exactfrom Turkey, and he had asked that his dissent might be re-corded. Mr. Chamberlain, however, had intervened and loadasked that the question might be postponed until today inthe abssnce of the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for India, and the secretary had consequently not recorded either the decision or hisdissent.    In addition to the arguments, he had used on theprevious day, he pointed out that all reference to Armeniawas omitted from the terms of an armistice, and a telegram had been circulated by the Foreign Office on that verymorning in which some Armenian authority had urged that itwas essential that Armenia should not be overlooked.    Hesuggested that the Secretary of State for India should beasked to attend the meeting.The Prime Minister said that, so far as Armenia was concerned, the argument when the decision was taken hadbeen that if the Allies were in Constantinople they could do what they liked as regards Armenia.
Sir Maurice Hankey said that he he,d endeavoured,in onthe previous evening, to communicate with Mr. Montagu,who had left london, but he had not succeeded, and conse-quently he would not be able to attend the Meeting.She Prime Minister said that he had that morning re-oeived a Memorandum from Mr, Montagu, in which he had giv-en many of the arguments adduced by lord Curzon on the pre-vious evening.    He understood that these would be circulate-ed to Members of the War Cabinet,Mr. Chamberlain recalled that, on the previous eveningthe point had been raised that, in view of the negotiations with had been undertaken with the French, it would not nowbe desirable to send a fresh telegram to $dm. Admiral Cal-throp.Lord Curzon said that we had already instructed AdmiralCalthrop to try and obtain all the 22 points, but told himif he could not get all,he was to content himself with 4.His present suggestion was merely to send a second tele-gram asking him to try and obtain some of the 22, if hecould not obtain them all.    She point which he consideredmost vital was the evacuation of the Caucasus.    If only the4 points were secured, the Turks would hold Batoum, whichcommanded the Black Sea, and Baku, which commanded the caspian.    In the Caucasus he included the regions of Per-sia now occupied by the Turks, and he would add all terri-tory in Arabia.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Turks, by occu-pying the Caucasus, had prevented the exploitation of that..region by the Germans , who wanted to get rid of them., andthis was an argument for retaining them there for thepresent.General Harington said that the bulk of the Germans had now gone, though there might be a few left.2S,
Mr0 Salfour agreed, with Lord Our2on that, in thelast resort, it was absolutely essential to get security for the Armenians and the Caucasus.    Turkey, however, ifwe were in Constantinople, would not he in a position to resist our demands.   Yet if Turkey declined our terms of,an armistice, she would   cease to exist.    The great danger was that during the period of the armistice the Turks mighthHMK do something foolish in Armenia or the Caucasus.    Sure-ly, however, we might assume that they would not he sofoolish.Lord Curzon said that what he apprehended was that, inthe negotiation for peace, we should have to pay a price to get the Turks out of the Caucasus, Slexandretta, Mosul,&amp;c0The Prime Minister said that the position was compar-ahle to what it would he if we were so beaten that the Ger-man fleet was in the Thames, with garrisons at Greenwichand other parts of London;   the German Fleet in the &quot;pool&quot;ready to bombard London.    Would it then be worth while forus to bargain about distant colonies when the whole of our country was at Germany1s mercy?   If Admiral Calthrop reach-ed Constantinople, nothing else really mattered.    He remind-ed his colleagues that the French had at first been annoy-ed, but that, when we put this point of view to M. Clemen-Clemenceau, he at once agreed with us.lord Curzon said this argument amounted to the assump-tion that Constantinople was occiipied as a gauge.    lord curzon said that, when we reached Constantinople, the Turks would at once show the greatest joy and would want us tomake an Alliance, and would then resist the terms we wishedto impose.Mr. Bonar Lav/ said that if we were in Berlin we shouldnot bother about bridgeheads on the Rhine, &amp;c., and the
same appeared to apply in the case of Constantinople.Mr, Chamberlain suggested a fresh telegram might hesent to the Admiral to inform him that his present instruc-tions stand, hut that, in bargaining for the 22 points,he should try, if possible, to secure certain items tobe designated.Sir Brio Geddes asked if this could be done withoutmuddling the Admiral?The Prime Minister pointed out that once we begin to alter the terms we should get into difficulties with theFrench and the Italians, who would each complain if theirown particular terms were not included.    He hoped that, hav-ing given these instructions, we should not change them.Mr. Balfour asked where the Turks would get their pow-der, guns, and ships from, if Constantinople were occupiedand they were cut off from Germany?lord Ctirzon said that surely the first condition of an armistice was always the withdrawal from occupied terri-tory.    This, at any rate, was the first condition prelimirt-ary even to an armistice with Germany.   In the same way,we ought to insist on Turkey withdrawing from Persia andTranscaucasia.The Prime Minister said that, if once we made any al-teration, the French would find cause for complaint.    Ifthese arguments had been pressed at the War Cabinet whenthe decision was taken, the conclusion might have been adifferent one.   After having had all this difficulty withthe French; after sending over lord Milner on a specialmission to persuade them to take our point of view; andhaving secured an agreement, he felt we could not reverseit.    It would not be fair to lord Milner0
illOn these grounds, the Yfar Cabinet decided thatNo further instructions should &quot;besent to Admiral Calthrop.(Iiox^d Curzon ashed that his protest might-be recorded against this decision!.Jit shall Gardens, S.W. ,Ootober 26, 1918.
