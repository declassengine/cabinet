Mr Balfour said that he had to bring before the WarCabinet one of those perplexing problems which, as we approached the end of the War, would probably arise more and more frequently.The matter he wished the Cabinet to consider arose from a conver-sation which Sir Eric Drummond had had with Count Horodyski.The latter was a Pole.    He belonged to M. Demowskfs party, whichwas the one which the Allies had always countenanced and support-ed;   whether rightly or wrongly, he did not know.    Count Horodyskiwas intimately acquainted with European politics, a Polish patriotand strongly pro-Entente.   Mr Balfour then read Sir Eric Drummondfeconversation with Count Harodyski (Appendix I).    This was not aquestion that Mr Balfour could turn down without Cabinet author-ity, nor, on the contrary, could he assent to it without cabinet authority. Perhaps the proposals were rather too melodramatic,according to his own prosaic instincts;    nevertheless, he couldnot see how the discontented component races of Austria were tocoalesce without some plan of this kind on the part of the Allies.It would be perfectly useless for the different elements in theAustrian problem, as it were, to have separate outbreaks and ex-plosions .    The only chance of success was that all the explosionsshould be simultaneous, and they must be adapted to the military position of the Allies.The Prime Minister said that this was so largely a mill-   tary problem that he would have preferred to have the views of theJ IChief of the Imperial General Staff before taking a decision.The Secretary said that the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff had been asked to the Meeting, but he had been extremelybusy and had asked to leave the military aspects of the question to the Secretary of State for War.The Prime Minister said that any futile revolutions un austria would do more harm than good.    This was why he wanted theopinion of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.    supposing that a real revolution in Galicia and Bohemia was practicable,
even although very difficult, he wished to know whether they had sufficient cannon, rifles and machine-guns.    Otherwise, hal f a dozen Magyar Divisions, properly equipped, would very soon put it down.    The leaders would then become marked men, and the spiritof the Czecho-Slovaks would be depressed.    On the other hand, ifsuch a revolution could be timed to follow a successful Italianoffensive,  we might be able to equip and support and draw fightingmaterial from the revolution.    If brought off prematurely, agreat opportunity would be thrown away.    At the present moment hecould see no prospect of a success of this kind.Mr balfour pointed out that an Italian success would not enable us to render direct assistance in Bohemia or Galicia,Mr Barnes suggested that there were too many factors inCount Horodyski&apos;s proposition which had all to go off simultane-ously.Lord Ourzon pointed out that the problem was not onlymilitary, but diplomatic and political also.    The first questionwhich had to be considered was as to the reliability of CountHorodyski.    Lord Curzon was not sure that in the past Count liorod-yski had proved a very successful adviser.     Lord Curzon then tookCount Horodyski&apos;s proposals in tfee sequence ^^rf^iefew^fee^^-werestat-ed-%y-&quot;&amp;d-3?--Brio-^BrtmHQond.    The first proposal was for a Polishrevolution.    No doubt Count Horodyski knew more of this matterthan he did, but his impression was that  Count Horodyski was oneof those able, patriotic, impulsive people who were always pro-ducing schemes which had,  in the main, to be carried out by other people.    In regard to the second point, the Italian offensive,Lord Ourzon doubted whether it would ever become a sufficientmenace to Austria to produce great results.      His third point,of inducing Roumania to enter the field again, appeared stillmore hopeless.    At the present time Roumania was destroyed andprostrate under the heel of the conqueror.    He much doubted if anything could ever be expected of her.    In regard to the proposed
peace with. Bulgaria, there were two difficulties:-(l) That it was difficult to reconcile it with thedesiderata of our Allies:(S) That King Ferdinand was shifty and unreliable.As regards the proposed simultaneous intervention in Russia,  lord curzon pointed out that we had been aiming at this policy for months, and up to now had failed.    Supposing, however, Count Horod-yski&apos;s plan were a possible one:    was it likely to be successfulnow?    For his part, he was very doubtful about embarking, in ourpresent difficulties, on so uncertain a plan, in which we were dependent upon personalities about whom he was so doubtful.(At this point there was considerable discussion as to Count H6rodyskiTs bona fides.)Mr Balfour pointed, out that if Bohemia could be induced to rise, and the presence of several Magyar Divisions was requiredto suppress the revolution, it would doubly weaken the Austrianson the Italian Front, since it would not only draw off MagyarDivisions,  but/the Czecho-Slovak Divisions would certainly refuse tofight.The Prime Minister pointed out that it was very uncertainwhat would be the result of an unsuccessful revolution.    He remind-ed the War Cabinet of how,  in 1745, the Hanoverians crushed the highlands, with the ultimate resiilt that the Black Watch and otherdistinguished regiments of the British Army were recruited in the severy regions.Lord Curzon asked if we were wise to trouble ourselves somuch about Poland,  except insofar as direct help could be obtainedfrom that quarter.   A propos of the declaration of the VersaillesConference, he had received a letter from, a distinguished man,whohad said that he himself was somewhat reluctant to fight for Alsace- ILorraine;    he was still more reluctant to fight for ItalyTs aspira-tions;    he was willing to continue the fight for South-West Africa,but he really could not understand how he could be asked to fight for Poland, which he understood to be the logical conclusion to bedrawn from the Versailles declaration.    Lord Curzon suggested that
the question of Poland was a secondary one.Mr Balfour said he understood our policy to be to use tothe utmost all anti-Germanic influences in all parts of the world.Germany had tried for a long time to crush Poland, and had failed.Just as we had spent money to give their land to the Irish,  so the Germans had poured out money with the aim of buying out thePoles and putting in German s ettiers .   They had never, however,achieved success.    The Poles had always been bitterly opposed tothe Germans.    Could we, he ashed, abandon such a people?Mr Barnes said that, before he could countenance this pro-fject, we ought to get some definite information as to the chances of a rising taking place, and of its prospects.Mr Chamberlain said that neither of the extreme proposalsappealed to him, namely, to adopt Count Horodyski&apos;s proposal as it stood, or definitely to turn it down.   His view would be thatit should be pointed out to Count Horodyski that a great deal ofcombination was involved in his scheme.    He should be advised toget to work very secretly, not to arrange for the scheme to matureat any particular moment, but to ripen it gradually to a point where it could be  set in motion if a favourable opportunity arose.Probably Sventually one part of the scheme would start spontane-ously, and the others could then follow.    It might be that a Bohe-mian revolution would come first, and that this would be followedby an Italian offensive;    or other parts of the scheme might be started.    His own knowledge was insufficient to enable him to say whether the scheme was practicable, but his instinct was to keep it alive.    He did not wish, however, to be committed by this to aseparate peace with Bulgaria.( ) The War Cabinet then discussed telegram No.919, fromBerne, in regard to a possible peace with Bulgaria.Mr Balfour pointed out that we could not send troops intoBulgaria, although we could send money, if that were of any value,which was doubtful.    There were only two influences that we could
use:-(1) The Bulgarian desire to secure certain territory:(3) The Bulgarian fear of war with the United Statesof America. The chief reason for this fear wasthat the country would find itself without means-in the reconstruction period. At that time theywould want loans and help. The Bulgarians want-ed territory, but they did not want to be perman-ently under German domination. Consequently,they wished to turn to America after the War was over.The United States of America had asked for our views as to whetherthey should go to war with Bulgaria, and we had replied that,  onthe whole, we thought it was best that they should declare warboth on Bulgaria and Turkey.    In regard to the first point, he feltthat all discussion was very dangerous.   Any territorial discus-sions with Bulgaria were liable to prove a double-edged weaoon.The very thought of making terms with Bulgaria outraged both Serbiaand Greece.   Consequently, discussions on these lines created, thedanger that we should lose the enthusiasm of Greece and Serbiawithout getting Bulgaria out of the War.    In his own telegram No.791, to Berne, he had approved a formula contained in telegram No.919 from Berne,  on this subject, which seemed safe, namely, that:-&quot;If Bulgaria were to secede from the Central Powers,her legitimate aspirations would receive very favourable consideration.&quot;-Personally he would be inclined to give to Bulgaria the Bulgarianportion of the Dobrudja, and the Enos-Midia line, the uncontestedzone of Macedonia, and Kavalla if we could satisfy the Greeks bycompensations elsewhere.   He would compensate Roumania by givingthat country the  Roumanian portion of Bessarabia, but he did not like the prospect of entering into negotiations on this subject.The Prime Minister reverted to the subject of Count Horod-yski.    He pointed out that he was a man who went in and out ofneutralAllied and enemy circles in js&amp;fcpjsi countries to a considerable extent.    If he was to be used in this matter, and if his schemewas to be adopted, it would be necessary to commuribate to him alarge amount of information, such as the date of an Italian offensive and of a Czecho-Slovak rising.    He was known to be in touch with
M. Skrzynski, who was understood to be some relation of his, andM. Skrzynski was the agent of the Austrian Government in Switzer-land.    Consequently, it ?/ould not be safe to tell him too much.He did not wish to imply that Count Horodyski was an enemy agent,but he gave him the impression of a man who liked to be on pleasantterms with all parties, and to &quot;fuss round&quot;.Mr Chamberlain pointed out that, if these were his charac-teristics, he might be a very suitable man to use for bluff.The Prime Minister pointed out that Skrzynski had toldCount Horodyski of General Smuts&apos; visit.    In the one matter inwhich Count Horodyski had been tried he had failed us.   The PrimeMinister referred to a Polish Army which Count Horodyski hadinduced us to support and which had eventually turned round andjoined with the enemy.   That was the one real test we had of hisbona fides.Mr balfour pointed out that Count Horodyski was veryintimate with M.Bj5mowski, who was the leader of a large Polishparty.   His own sympathies, however, were with the Prime Minister,and he would not like to trust Count Horodyski too far.    Neverthe-less,  it was very difficult to see how the various elements un austria were to be worked up to the point of action without employ-ing such people.   All through history,  conspiracies had depended on such people, and although they had. often failed, they had some-times succeeded.    These matters passed outside the region of ordinary diplomacy, and he felt they were very difficult to dealwith.Horodyski, a good many of the suggestions in his programme couldbe put in operation:    for example,(I) The Italian offensive:(2) Russian intervention:(3) Propaganda, which would be greatly stimulatedif the Czecho-Slovak forces were brought to france .All these lines we were actually pursuing, but,  in his view,  itThe Prime Minister pointed out that, without employing
would be a mistake to get up -the revolution at the present time.Lord Milner said that the War Office were trying to induce the Italians to act, but they seemed to be most reluctant to fight.Their chances would be much greater if they would attack insteadof allowing the initiative to pass into the hands of the enemy.The Prime Minister said that the fact that the Austrianshad not attacked was probably a sign of the embarrassment of theAustrian Empire.Mr Balfour said it was very important to keep up the spititsof the rebellious races in Austria.Lord Milner said that our present military performanceswould probably tend to d.epress them.    If we could get mattersmoving in regard to the Gzecho-Slovaks and Russian intervention,their spirits would be raised.    These matters were being pursued.He doubted whether any inducements at present existed for Bulgariato leave her Allies.Mr Balfour pointed out that Turkey and Austria were bothvery weak, and that this might influence Bulgaria.General Smuts asked if we could not induce the Bulgariansto desert their allies by allowing them to go into Constantinople.Mr Balfour said his information was to the effect that king Ferdinand wished for this, but that the majority.of the Bul-garians only desired to secure what they regarded as Bulgarianterrit ory.Lord Milner suggested that, as the United States of Americawere still in diplomatic relations with Bulgaria, they ought to beable to obtain information.Mr Chamberlain suggested that Lord Reading should be askedto see Mr Lansing, and ascertain what news the Americans had, andwhether they were taking any action to get Bulgaria out of the War.Mr Balfour then read a draft telegram (Appendix II) toSir William Wiseman, in New York, which he thought would meet thecase, except for the last paragraph.
After some further discussion, the War Cabinet reached thefollowing conclusions:-(a) Count Horodyski&apos;s scheme was too ambitious forthe Allies to adopt as a working proposition,in view of their imperfect knowledge of many ofthe factors involved:(b) Two of the elements in the scheme,  namely, theItalian offensive and the result of negotiationswith Bulgaria, in both of which the British G-ov-ernment would be primarily concerned, were very doubtful of success:(c) We have no information about the readiness andequipment of Bohemia and Galicia for a revolu-tion:(d) The military position is not sufficiently favour-able to justify us in encouraging revolution un austria at the present moment:(e) The War Office should, press the Italians to attack:(f) The Foreign Office should ask the United States ofAmerica for information as to the situation in Bul-Bulgaria, and should encourage them to do what they cantowards the elimination of Bulgaria from the War:(g) Count Horodyski should be told that we do not thinkthat the moment for action has yet arrived, but heshould be encouraged to foster the Polish movement and to maintain the organisation.   Finally, heshould be told that we considered that a time will come when an opportunity may arise for the corabina-tion he proposes.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 13,  1918.
MOST SECRET..I had a long conversation yesterday with CountHorodysJki,He said that, at the present time, there was nuch unrest and excitement among&apos; the Polish population in Oaiicia. and in Polandproper.    Thin unrest would probably express itself in one of two ways &apos;   either by a Bolshevist movement among&quot; the Polish peasantrywhich would he directed against the Polish landowners:   or, with theadvice and assistance of these landowners, against Austrian andGerman domination.      He therefore proposed that ho and his friendsshould work for a revolution in Poland in the near future.     It was,however, quite clear that, such a revolution&quot; con id - not succeed if itwas an isolated incident/    The plan he proposed was as follows :certain prominent Austrian Poles in Switzerland, preparations shouldbe made for a Polish revolution to take slaoo towards the end ofAugust.(2),    DiuBenoR should, he&apos; asked to - arrange&apos; for a simul-ianoous revolution in Bohemia.(3).,     k strong offensive should be made by Italy, ,coinciding- with the outbreak of ihese revolutions..(4).    An attempt should be made to detach Bulgaria fromthe Central Powers by concluding a separate peace vith her at aboutthe same time.in Bohemia -and. in Poland-,&apos;  endeavours- should be. made to induceRomnarda to enter the field a^a-in.f6)-. &apos;  Ail these movements to be combined -with  allied intervention in Russia, both from the North and from Vladivostock.(1) .After consultation with itkDnowski in Paris   and(5),     Assbeinp successful, aAssuming - that the Italian offensive showed signs ofnd that the revolutions took place as proposed the whole scheme seems bo me to present such importantpossibilities
possibilities as to bo worthy of most careful examination.A decision as to whether it should bo proceeded with willbe required within the next week, because the prominefet AustrianPole on whom Count Horodyski relies will be in Switzerland aboutthe 18th of this month; and Count Horodyski is due to moot him then.He states that there will bo no difficulty in sending a Polish agentto Rouiaania for the purpose of sounding well-known- pro-AllyRoumanians if no British subject is available.If, on exsui nation, it is thought that the plan-offersreal&apos; chances- of success, X venture to surest *--fa)   That all the questions should he treated as oneproblem and nhouId be pieced under the supervision of r Minister,who should have entire responsibility for carrying out the various&apos;negotiations and detailn connected with the scheme, select suchstaff as he thinks desirable, etc..i&apos;b)   That a telegram should be sent to Colonel House forhis end the President&apos;s secret information, outlining, what isproposed, end urging the importance if intervention in Siberia as anessential&apos; part of the- plan.(e)   That a telegram on the lines of the attached draftcuhould.be sent&apos;-to Sir W.Wiseman with reread to the question ofsets chin;.; Bulgaria from the Central Powers.(a)   That Dr.&quot;Rene?; should be at once interviewed and thematter discussed with hi&quot;, 2nd perhaps.with IhCle-qenceau.(a)   That an ggont should; if possible.&apos; Tse sent immediately to Roumar&amp;a for the purpose of explaining the position to KingFerdinand.Count horodyski added that of course secrecy was of theutmost importance.   He was specieliv afr/aid that, if those Poleswho are opposed to H.Dmowoki got wind of the-scheme, they would endeavour to wreck it.mimics office, s jive ins.
Draft telegram to Sir W. Wiseman, (New York,June1918,Information has reached us since despatch of my tele-gram Mo.. 3Q45.that Bulgaria is anxious to conclude peace on reasoliable terms and avoid a declaration of war by theUnited States.I am not sure how far this is due to Bulgarian desireto stand well with &quot;both sides and it does not alter myopinion as to desirability for reasons already given of a simultaneous declaration of war on Turkey and Bulgaria, but should the United states definitely determine on such adeclaration it might be worth while sending for the BulgarianMinister some little time in advance and Informing him ofthe decision of the United States Government and that itwould take effect within a short period unless the bulgarian government chose to put forward reasonable peace proposalsfor the consideration of the Allies, such proposals would naturally have to take into account the position of Serbiaand Greece as Allied powers. It might he added that if the bulgarian Government did not see their way to make peace pro-posals the United states Government would do their utmostagainst them both from the military and economic poitrb ofview,   substance of my telegram of 29.th May might also beused in this connexion,,Probably the present moment is unfavourable for anyendeavour to detach Bulgaria from the Central Powers,   Buti  as I hope the Allies are able to prevent the enemy forces from gaining any substantial victory on the Western front the
the position will have completely changed after thenext five or six ?/eeks and Bulgaria will find herselffaced with a fresh winter campaign unless she makespeace,   For reasons which I will explain in a separatetelegram the beginning of August would seem a veryopportune time for making such an approach to the Bul-garian Minister, the date of the declaration of war onBulgaria and Turkey being fixed for the end of August,(9.6, 8/4).
