I infer thathe means to lean upon Council to support himif he has to over-ride views of Pershing&quot;.KER FROM (2) The Prime Minister stated that he had received a letter:RD READING\ THE PRIME   from Lord Reading in which he stated that the news of theCNISTER.British retreat and of the German success had come to thePresident as a great shock.   The President was genuinelyj anxious to render all possible help, but such help was beingretarded by defects in the administrative machine. criticism of the administration had redoubled, but this may have some-thing to do with the approaching elections.   There was noI     :reference in the letter to the Irish situation.KELAND.PfflpulsoryilitaryIf vice.(3) The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat he proposed to bring away gradually from Ireland all theIrish Reserve Battalions now in that country, and to substi-tute English Reserve Battalions.   He also proposed that,when-1-
compulsory military service became law in Ireland, to putIrish, recruits into depots in this country.The War Cabinet approved Lord Derby&quot;suggestion.AFF POST (4) Lord Derby stated that he had been approached with aR CAPTAINDMOND,M.P.   view to securing a Staff post for Captain Redmond, M,P.   Athis suggestion Captain Redmond had been offered a post on lord French&apos;s Staff, en condition that he would undertake not to divulge any information thus obtained, or make poli-tical use of it.    Captain Redmond was prepared to acceptthe post on these terms, and he (Lord Derby) proposed toappoint him.The War Cabinet approved of the appoint-ment on the conditions indicated.SSIAN BLACK      (5) With reference to War Cabinet 380, Minute 5, the[A FLEET.First Lord stated that he had been trying to make arrange-ments with the French and Italians in regard to the closer -operation of the Allied Fleets in the Mediterranean, tomeet the contingency of the Germans capturing the RussianFleet in the Black Sea.   He said it was desirable, fortraining purposes as well as for strategical purposes, toget the Italian Fleet to Corfu under Admiral Gauchet. TheAdmiralty proposed that the Naval Allied Council should first examine the question, with a mandate from the supreme war Council.    Sir Eric Geddes thought that the Italiansmight fall in with our ideas, to which the French had al-ready agreed, but he asked that, if they did not agree, thequestion should come before the Supreme War Council.The War Cabinet approved that a letter shouldbe sent from the Prime Minister to M.Clemenceauand Signor Orlando, asking that the allied naval Council should consider the question and prepare a Report for the Supreme WarCouncil.  (Appendix I).
APPENDIX lo42&quot;With reference to the general Naval situation in the Mediter^ranean, we have recently received a report through the French-Naval Attache in Roumania, indicating that there is some proHbability that the Russian Black Sea Fleet may shortly be handed over by Russia to Germany. This matter has, I under- Istand, already been under consideration at the Allied Naval council, who were of opinion that it will be practicable for germany to man at least all the more modern units of theRussian Black Sea Fleet, and in the course of time render them efficient fighting units, so that in conjunction withthe German and Turkish warships now within the Dardanellesthey would be available for operations in the open Mediter-ranean. This possibility creates an entirely new situationin the Eastern Mediterranean, since the Allied Naval forces are not at present organised or distributed with a view tothis contingency. Moreover, in such an event, an attemptto combine with the Austrian Fleet in the Adriatic must alsatbe regarded as a possibility.   Under these conditions I amof opinion that the Naval situation in the Mediterraneanought to be considered by the Supreme War Council at ournext Meetings, and I desire to propose to you that this shallbe done, and also that the Members of the Allied Naval Goun-cil should be invited to attend these Meetings of the supreme war Council so that the general Naval position in the Medit-mediterranean may be discussed with them in the light or the new conditions which may arise in the near future. If you are inagreement with me I suggest further that the Allied NavalCouncil should now be asked to prepare a Report giving their recommendations on all these matters, that is, on the dispo-sition of the Allied Naval forces, the relative Commands,andthe operation of the anti-submarine campaign including escor-and convoy work in the Mediterranean, in order that theSupreme War Council may consider the subject fully in allitsjaspects.   If you concur in these proposals I should be muchobliged if you would inform me by telegram, when I will cause the necessary instructions to be issued to the allied naval Council here, and no doubt you will inform the Repre-sentatives of your country on that Council.&quot;

(Appendix II).AIRKTRY.With reference to War Cabinet 388A. Minute 1, theWar Cabinet approved:-April 13, 1918.tehall Gardens, S.Ws
9th April,  1918.The Prime Minister.I have now filled the office,  but Without the full powers,  of Secretary of State for Air for four and a halfmonths.Until a week ago the flying Services were under three distinct and often conflicting authorities - theAir Ministry, the Royal flying Oorps, and the Royal Naval AirService.      Oh April 1st the two latter Services were brought under the Air Ministry, and thus all the flying Services are nowunified in the Royal Air Force,  as created by Act of Parliament.As the Secretary of State for Air has now constitution-ally the full control and responsibility (except as regardsthe air part of the defences of this Country) which I havenot had hitherto,  it has become my duty to review carefully thegeneral situation in the Royal Air Porce, with a view to deciding what reorganisation,  if any,  is necessary or desirable in order,that this arm may be so constituted as to meet the heavyresponsibilities devolving upon it.After long and careful consideration I have decidedthat certain changes in personnel and organisation are essential to the efficiency of the Force.I am dissatisfied with existing conditions in a numberof respects,  among which the following are the chief :-There is no organised department in this Ministrywhose sole function it is to consider air strategy,  to formreasoned plans for our own future operations, and to anticipate the plans of the enemy.   No regular conferences upon Air strategyhave taken place,    ho sufficient co-ordination exists betweenobjects to be achieved by air fighting,  and the types and numbersof machines necessary to accomplish these objects.  On the onehand
-i t !hand,  contracts involving great sums of money have been placedwithout strategic consideration, while on the other, insufficientprovision has been made for machines for the bombing of german towns, at least before the end of this year,  on a scale which alone might produce decisive results.The organisation for training pilots isconfused and inefficient.      Wholly different systems are inforce in different centres of instruction.      Training aeroplanesknown to be unsuitable are still largely employed, and indeedare being manufactured in large numbers.    A brilliant officer,who as the hea.d of a training centre has shown results ofstriking success, has been refused opportunities of extendinghis method.    The output of pilots in proportion to pupils under training has decreased.Fatal casualties among pupils have had my most anxious consideration.    These are far too numerous, amountingat the present time to no fewer than three a day, and theproportion of them has lately increased.    In some trainingcentres the number of pupils killed is most distressing, whereas in others there are almost none.     The whole organisation oftraining demands drastic reconstitution.In the Equipment branch very large businesstransactions are under the control of a regular officer,necessarily without business experience.In the important matter of inventions,authority is divided among a number of departments, with thenatural consequence of great delay, endlessly deferred decisions,[and failure to obtain practical results from the advance of scientific knowledge.On the question of man-power, too, I am gravelydissatisfied with the state of things in the Royal Air Force.The Air Council is making constant demands for the increase of
man-power in the Force, acting on the view that nearly 50 menare necessary to keep one machine in the air against the enemy,kfter careful inquiry I have become convinced that about half that number of men, efficiently trained and organised, would suffice.     That is, unless the demands for areoplanes are verylargely increased above the present programme, I anticipate thatour demands upon the War Cabinet for further men will not be verylarge.The number of naval machines flying,for instance,bears no reasonable relation whatever to the 45,000 men in theformer R.U.A.S.     But without thorough reorganisation it willbe impossible to get rid of this extravagance in men.To give a final example, the employment of aeroplanes not needed for other services in the convoying ofmerchant vessels in home waters, is obviously a matter of themost urgent importance, in view of the striking success which hasattended such convoying.     She organisation of this service called for elasticity of outlook and the greatest promptitude in action.I have not found these qualities shown in the requisite degree.In general, the control and direction of theAir Force in this country is too largely in the hands of officerswhose views have become stereotyped by the traditions of the olderServices.     The prospect at present is that the Royal AirForce may settle down into a sub-arm of war, auxiliary to theArmy and Uavy, instead of becoming, as it should, a greatindependent arm, destined ultimately to be the determining factor in the war.The Royal Air Force is a young Force, its ideasmust be the untrammelled ideas of comparative youth, its activities demand the efforts of young bodies and young minds.The accretions of War Office and Admiralty tradition will be fatal to its proper and possible development.The changes I propose to make, to give effect
to the above views, are in their main outline as follows:Major-General Sir Hugh Irene-hard, . Chief of theAir Staff, does not see eye to eye with me on many matters whichI regard as essential.     As a commanding officer he has doubtlessexhibited great qualities.    As a Chief of the Air Staff he hasnot the outlook,  the ability to study soientifieally theoreticalproblems, the readiness to advance young officers of merit,  orthe willingness to associate others with his work, which in myopinion are indispensable in a man filling this post.    His view,in spite of my protests t  of the duties of the Deputy Chief of theAir Staff, is that this Officer should merely &quot;devil&quot; for him,and he has proposed an appointment to this position of which he knows that I disapprovesI may point cut,  in this connection, that while907c. of the officers of the Royal Air Force hold temporary or special commissions from the Army or Navy, not one of them hasbeen advanced to the rank of Brigadier-General in any operatingtheatre of war or in the Training Division.In consequence of the divergence of our views hehas placed his resignation in my hands, and this resignationI propose to accept.In his place, as Chief of the Air.Staff, I proposeto appoint Brigadier-General Sykes, C.-M.G* and as deputy chief of the Air Staff, in the place of Admiral Mark Kerr,who five weeks ago accepted the position of G.O.C. Western AirForce Area,  I propose to appoint Brig.-General R.M.Groves,D.S,0*I propose to create a small Strategical Committeeto be virtually in constant session, which will continuouslystudy and come to decisions upon strategical air problems andthe best means of carrying these decisions Into effect,.
This Strategical Committee will report its decisions to the Air Council,  and when they are approved,   the Director-General of Aircraft Production will &quot;be instructed by the Councilto place orders for the manufacture of the requisite machines,the Director-General of Equipment instructed to provide other material necessary,  and the Director-General of Training instructedto arrange for the provision and training of the pilots required.This appears to me to be the logical and proper pro-cedure.I propose to remove the training of pilots from theoffice of Master-General of Personnel,  and to appoint to thepost of Director-General of Training Lieut.-Colonel R.R. Smith-Barry,  the Officer to whom allusion has previously been made.This Officer,   I may add,  was made by me Brigadier-General and placed in Command of a Training Brigade,  but he found that theexisting system and conditions of training rendered it impossiblefor him to produce satisfactory results,  and therefore asked tobe allowed to relinquish his higher rank and to return as Lieut.-Colonel to his previous command,   the School of Special Plyingat Go sport.I propose to appoint a civilian Assistant to theDirector-General of Equipment,   namely, Mr. Bertram Jones,   a business man of great and responsible experience.V/ith other changes I propose to make I need not troubleyou,  but I may say they will be in the direction of giving higherrank and greater influence to younger Officers who by great actualflying experience and marked ability are qualified for responsi-bili ty.I ask for your approval of changes which I regard asindispensable in the interests and. to the efficient developmentof the Royal Air Force,   and therefore as calculated to help ina large degree to bring the war to a victorious conclusion.(Sgd.)    ROTHERMERE.Secretary of State for Air.
