(This Document is the Property of His ., 03 E 0 R B T. Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government), pWAR CABINET 576a.DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W.,im on THURSDAY, MARCH 28, 1918, at 11.20 a.m.SUMMONING (1) After the withdrawal of Ministers,who are not Mem-OP PARLIA-MENT. bers of the War Cabinet,and experts, the War Cabinet metIRELAND. to continue the discussion regorded In War Cabinet 376,COMPULSORY   and to take their decision on the connected questions ofMILITARYSERVICE.       the application of Compulsory Military Service to Irelandand the date on which Parliament was to meet.The Prime Minister said that there were two questions for decision:-CD Should Ireland be included in the new MilitaryService Bill?&apos;fii) If the decision was in the affirmative, shouldParliament be summoned to meet on Tuesday next?He gathered from the trend of the previous discussion that lord Curzon and Lord Milner were in favour of applyingCompulsory Military Service to Ireland: that Lord Curzonwas considerably influenced by the argument that it was worth while, in order to ease the application of compulsory military Service to Ireland, not to summon Parliament untilthe Irish Convention had reported: but that Lord Milnerwas in favour of ^mmoning Parliament immedis-tely.Lord Curzon said that his consent to postponing theMeeting of Parliament was based on the conviction that,    \if the Meeting of Parliament was not hastened, the WarCabinet would proceed simultaneously with both the polic-ies &amp;  carrying the measure of Home Rule, based on the conventions Report, and of applying Compulsory MilitaryService to Ireland.Mr. Balfour said that he was much influenced by the pol-political argument that, in order to carry the measures of
Compulsory Military Service in Great Britain, which themilitary situation required, it was necessary at the sametime to apply Compulsory Military Service to Ireland.    Atthe same time, he was very desirous of applying compulsory military Service to Ireland with a minimum of difficulty,and for this reason he was in favour of awaiting the Reportof the Irish Convention, and dealing with the two questionstogether.    This involved postponing the introduction of theMilitary Service Bill until the date already arranged for*the Meeting of Parliament.   As regards the argument thatthe degree of urgency on April 9, would he less than onApril 2, he personally felt there was little prospect ofany diminution of the tension by the later date.Mr. Duke said that Mr. Balfour had entirely expressed his views.Lord Miner urged strongly that Parliament should be summoned on Tuesday nest, and that the whole of the pol-icy incorporated in the preliminary Draft Bill circulatedby the Minister of National Service (G-. T.4036), includingthe application of Compulsory Military Service to Ireland,should then be introduced.    The only exception he wouldmake would be in the case of the proposal to lower theage limit to 17, which he was willing to drop.    In his view the whole question should be considered as one.    our military Advisers,and the Minister of National Service, were unanimous that there was not a day to lose from the milit-ary point of view.    There was, however, another very strong arguement for immediate action.    If time were allowed toslip by the public would become accustomed to the criticalstate of affairs, and the great opportunity afforded bythe sense of immediate danger for carrying, without delay,the measures essential to meet the needs of the militarysituation, would be lost.    He wished to have his dissentrecorded from any policy of postponing the meeting of Par-liament later than April 2.
General Smuts said that he had never heard a strongerto Ireland, ^v&apos;-*2- ?^-e.^^Cc ^&apos;^*/&apos;;&apos;i^&apos;e-edi&apos;***) Mr. Barnes said that he was by no means certain that hecould assent at all to the enforcement of Compulsory Mil-( itary Service in Ireland.    When the proposal had first beenbraised he had felt instinctively that it was fraught withdanger.    The evidence he had heard from the experts of theIrish Government had immensely strengthened this conviction,jlf, however, Compulsory Service in Ireland was found to be unavoidable, he would prefer to introduce it on the linesiproposed by General Smuts.?l    Mr. Bonar Law was of opinion that further considerationof the question was necessary before a final decision was(taken.. He was opposed to summoning Parliament to meet on tuesday next.The Prime Minister said that, on the whole, he was in-clined to agree with Lord Curzon and Mr. Balfour.    He was more impressed with the views of Sir Edward Carson than with those of the Officers and Officials from Ireland.    Hethought that the latter were possibly influenced, to someextent, by the difficult local conditions in which theycase than that presented by the responsible experts charg-ed with the administration of government in Ireland.againstthe application of Compulsory Military Service to thatcountry.    In these circiunstances it was necessary to pro-ceed carefully,,    At the same time he fully realised the weight of the argument that, in order to pass the essentialmeasures for Great Britain, it was necessary to apply Mil-itary Service to Ireland.    This was the reason for his re-commendation that, in the event of the Irish Conventionagreeing on a Report, the Government should simultaneouslyintroduce a scheme of Home Rule,&quot;based on the ConventionsReport,, and a Military Service Bill for the United Kingdom,
X &amp;carried on their work.    He was much influenced &quot;by the ar-gument that we might get even 50,000 efficient soldiersfor the Army from Ireland.    At the same time he was oppos-ed to the introduction of the necessary legislation untilthe Report of the Irish Convention was to hand,j Mr. Bonar Law was very doubtful as to whether the Reportof the Irish Convention would really make the governments position any easier, since it was bound to alienate the ulster Members and those who sympathised with them.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Irish were taken for Compulsory Military Service in large numbers in theUnited States of America, though they were exempted here.The argument of the Irish in regard to this was that,*in the United States of America, they had their political rights.    He understood that an Act, based an the Report ofthe Convention, would give them practically the same pol-political rights as they had in the United States of America,and this argument would be removed.I The War Cabinet decided that:-Parliament should not be summoned to meetnext Tuesday.(Lord Milner asked that his dissent from this proposal might be recorded),!HS IRISH       (2) Mr. Luke undertook to circulate to the Members of thepHTMTI OH&quot;.War Cabinet an explanatory Memorandum of the Resolutionsalready agreed to by the Irish Convention, on which theirReport would be based.s Whitehall Gardens,  3.17. ,larch 28, 1918.
