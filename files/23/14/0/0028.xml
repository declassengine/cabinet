WESTERN FRONT.

(1) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that he had just returned from France after having seen General Foch. General Foch appeared to be very satisfied with the situation and had hopes that he would be able to drive the Germans back as far as the River Vesle, and that then the Germans would take up the line, Rheims-Boissons. General Foch was of the opinion that the Germans were fighting hard on either flank in order to get their material away from the salient. General Foch was, however, making things very uncomfortable for the enemy by tapping a long way back with his heavy guns. The two bridges at Missy were under French gun fire as well as the main road between Fere en Tardenois and Chateau Thierry.                           Reserves.

(2) General Wilson stated that the General Issimo was re-fitting his tired divisions south of the Somme in the area, Beauvais-Compiegne. By doing this Sir Douglas Haig would be enabled to take away two reserve divisions he had at present on and just south of the Somme. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff added that General Foch was very pleased with the way the British had fought. General Foch claimed that he now had more reserve divisions in hand than the enemy.       Attacks.

(3) In reply to a question as to whether he thought the British would hold their own if Prince Rupprecht attacked on our front, the Chief

 


of the Imperial General Staff stated that thegeneral opinion in France of all the people he had seen, was that we should be able to do so.     TheDunkirk area had been again re-flooded yester&amp;a,, asa precautionary measure, and our back lines were ina very satisfactory state of defence.     The Chiefof the Imperial General Staff said that indications of an attack in the north still continued to appearbut that the German plans had probably been verymuch upset by the rough handling they received inthe south.     i&amp;aiaasg&amp;aiiH^^mMii^^^lm^^^m^^^^m^^^^wm^^m^mm^. Gene ralWilson himself, however, was of opinion that it4would, not be characterlatic of the Germane to re- - rain from an attack.    Their best place would undoubtedly be on. the front Montdidier-iioyon,    Anattack in this sector would relieve the Grown Princeend get behind General foch.      iie of General Foch&apos;sreasons for resting his tired Divisions near the somme was because of the possibility of an attack Inthis area.The far Cabinet then discussed the possibilityof the Germans making an attack in some Easterntheatre of war, or in Italy.    The Prime ministers aid that it would be difficult for the German high command to abandon the offensive at this moment,especially after the manner in which they had ledon public opinion in Germany to anticipate amilitary decision this year, which would bring peace.Mention was made of the fact that Signer Mittiwas at-the present moment in this country and had stated that he had rather expected an attack onthe Italian front.     One of his reasons being that
the Austrians had now between SO to 25 Divisions morethan the Italians.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatthe War Office information did not confirm this.    he added that if the Germans ceased their offensive inFrance immediately, they might be able to mount anattack against the Italians in about six weeks time.The Prime Minister said that Signor litti had come over to this country with certain proposals which required discussion.       These proposals included(i) Railway Wagons,  (ii) The improvement of the Railwaycommunication between France and Italy, and (iii)American troops for Italy.The Prime Minister had asked General cavan to postpone his departure in order to attend this discussion.It was decided that -The Meeting ohould be held at six: o&apos;clockthat evening and that lord Milner, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff, Lord Cavan,and the Director of Military Intelligenceshould attend.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.24th July, 1918.
