DRAFT MINCTKS of a Meeting held at 10. Downing Street3.W.,on TODKRSDAY, 3RPT1ISBR 4,  1918, at 13 Moon.I     ^ --------.----------------fg.E CRUISER     The War Cabinet had under constdelation a Eesicrandua byIviOiM ANDPBhlLDINS   the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-5575) on the Battle Cruiser Post-pfiAMM&apos;)?.-*tion and the Admiralty Shipbuilding Programme.The First ford of the Admiralty stated that lie wished:(J particularly to draw attention to two points in the Hsiao-randua:    firstly, that, in addition to the HOOP, the build-in,?-;&apos;, of two other Battle Cruise.ee should be carried out. at a normal rate;    secondly, that an agreement should, be -arrivedat with the United States Government by which they shouldrender material haval assistance out of the resources now attheir disposal of those classes of vessels of which theI Allies stand most in need,  thus enabling the Admiralty ship-building programme, as already approved by the &quot;Jar Cabinet,to be reduced in the direction indicated in the admiralty memorandum.    Sir Pirie (Jeddes explained the situation as tothe comparative position in Battle Cruisers, between Great- Britain and Germany on January 1, -1919,- Midsummer 1919, and&apos;  in 19sOs whieh indicated&apos; that in 1919 our position would bei practically of eqxml strength as regards Battle Cruisers&apos;,though the enemy -would have an advantage in being able to!&apos; choose their own time for an engagement, which might resultin one of our Battle Cruisers being under refit at the time.
In 1920, however, our Battle Cruiser force would be inferiorto that of the Germans.   He stated that the two battle cruisers of the HOOD Class, for which he asked permission to continue the const ruction, would not be ready until 19S1,unless extra men were employed on the same with a view toexpediting their completion in the previous year.The First Lord and the First Sea Lord briefly explained to the &quot;ar Cabinet the dangers to which we should be exposedin the event of a German superiority in Hat tie Cruisers, andalso indicated the tactical methods of employment of battle cruisers, one of which was that they -might be vised by theenemy so that our Battle Fleet would be &quot;unable to achieve a decisive victory over the enemy&apos;s laain Fleet.The First Sea Lord was asked to prepare- astatement for the &quot;?ar Cabinet, showing the risks that would be incurred if the Gewoanshad a superiority in this class of vessel.Sir- Erie Geddes pointed out that the const ruction of thesetwo Battle Cruisers would scan the retention by the Admiraltyof men now in their employment, to the extent of 5,000 from january 1, 1919. until the beginning of 1921, and an addi-tional 5.000 from the same date up to the middle of 19?, 1.This, translated into terms of merchant tonnage, lie estimated as equivalent to  00,000. tons a year.    This figure waa ap-proximately oonfteaed by Lord Pirrie.. who estimated theadditional amount of merchant shipbuilding that could be built in the 2.3? years as the result of the release of thesemen as 450,000 tons.Mr Churchill mentioned that the late. Controller of theAdmiralty had always computed that the building of one battle cruiser absorbed in skilled labour and materials an equivalent of effort required for 50 standard merchant ships.As regards acquiring Battle Cruisers from some other Power,Sir Flrio Geddes stated that the only nation that owned battle cruisers, other than the Germans and ourselves, v./as theJapanese, though some were being built in the United States,
j.      dwhich would not be ready until 192.3.    As regards theJapanese Battle Crxiisers, we had used every effort to oh-tain these, but with no result.Mr Churchill suggested that it might be possible to temptthe Japanese to part with their Battle Cruisers in the ratio of an exchange of two raodern Battleships for one battle cruiser, but Sir Eric Geddes doubted whether sue?-.&apos;, an offer would be accepted, even if it were deemed desirable.The Prime Minister pointed out that the whole questionof the provision of these extra Battle cruisers was one of comparative merit as compared with other claims for man-power and material that had of late been considered by theGovernment, and that the effect of the construction of thesetwo vessels would not be, realised for another two years.We also had to bear in mind, froia a post-War point of view,the extensions that were being made to the American mer-cantile marine, and the effect on our welfare of the lossof nearly half a million tons of shipping on our part.    liealso pointed out that the Germans had quite recently removed from their Admiralty those responsible for the past Navalshipbuilding programme, and consequently the German effortas regards their new Battle Cruisers might be changed.Sir Joseph Maclay stated that it was desirable that theconsideration of the question should be deferred until June,1919, when the mercantile shipbuilding programme, as far as could be foreseen, would have rendered our position safe inthat respect, as far as the conduct of the War was concerned,sir Churchill remarked that such a postponement would alsobe helpful from the point, of view of the Ministry of JSunl-tions, as by that  time the bulk of the materiel for the1919 offensive&apos; would have been provided by his Department,and longer viev.-s could more accurately be taken as regardsfuture policy.
153The War Cabinet decided that -The question of the construction of the twoBattle Cruisers asked for by the Board ofAdmiralty should be deferred until 3&amp;Ma&amp;y,In connection with the second proposal of the Admiralty,that an agreement should be arrived at between the UnitedStates Government and ourselves as to their supplementingour Fleet in certain respects, with a consequent reductionin our Naval Programme, Sir Kria Geddes explained that, ifachieved, this would, apart from the 10,000 men already referred to, result in the Admiralty being able to transfer to merchant shipbuilding 32,000 men, beginning as soon as -the agreement had been effected.   He added that he did not wish any reduction made .in the British Naval programme untilthe agreement had been approved, and stated that there wasno possibility of getting such approval from this side ofthe Atlantic.   He therefore proposed that he, should visitAmerica, with a view to this being obtained.    Until thematter was settled, however, he was not hopeful of being able to transfer any of the men he had referred to previous-ously to mercantile shipbuilding.Lord Pirrie and Sir Joseph Maclay both Urged that someof the men should be released at the earliest possible date,with a view to finishing off a number&apos; of ships which were inan advanced state.The War Cabinet approved the First Lord ofthe Admiralty proceeding to the&apos;-United States,with a view to concluding- the agreement inquestion, his date of departure being arrangedafter consultation with Lord Reading.fhit e ha 11 Ga r de ns, 8 . w,,September 4,  1918.
