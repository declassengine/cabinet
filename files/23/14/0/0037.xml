(1) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated thatthere was no change in the general military situation,(S) The attention of the War Cabinet was called to anarticle by the &quot;Times&quot; Correspondent at Washington, entitled&quot;President Wilson11 s Political Offensive&quot;, which had appeared that morning, and strong objection was taken, in particular,to the following passage:-&quot; ... The President, say his admirers, hasall along shown in his addresses that hedeprecates an undue war mania, not be-cause he is less determined than Mr LloydGeorge or M. Clemenceau to crush Prussian-ism, but because he believes that it wouldmilitate against a fair and lasting peace.He stands for peace with justice, for peaceuntrammelled by participation at thesettlement of the ^^t^^ diplomacy ofPrussia,  but also free from any taintof an old-fashioned,   secret and revengefuldiplomacy in any form.    The Allies, it isnow felt, have swung round to this view.&quot;The article appeared to have been officially inspired, asan indication of the views of President Wilson.Lord Reading said that perhaps it would be more eor-rect to say, not that it was inspired, but that it reflected the atmosphere at Washington.The Prime Minister pointed out that much of what mr balfour and himself had said corresponded with PresidentWilson&apos;s principles.    With regard to the Fourteen Points,the War Cabinet had settled their answer to the enemy three days before the Fourteen Points were issued, and PresidentWilson&apos;s proclamation included practically only two newpoints, one dealing with the Freedom of the Seas and theother with the Economic question.    Mr Balfour had also madea full statement of the War Aims of the Allies,  in a des-patch written in January, 1917, before the Americans came into the War.Mr Chamberlain suggested that there should be publish-ed in the &quot;Times&quot; an inspired article calling attention tothe misapprehension which apparently existed in some circles
in Washington, but not in Government circles, as to the objects of the Allies.The Prime Minister said that the matter ought to bedealt with at once.    There had been a mischievous suggestion in the House of Commons,  on the previous day, of divisionamong the Allies.    The only communication which the Govern-ment so fer had made to the Press had been in writing, andit had appeared on Monday, October 14,  1918, and it was avery moderate statement.    If the Government were open tocensure,  it was that no guidance had been given to the Press.Mr Chamberlain said that the suggestion in the &quot;Times&quot;article was the exact reverse of the truth, as the reallyvindictive policy was &quot;that put forward by President Wilsonin his Third Point, dealing with the removal of arbitrarypower, a policy analogous to that of &quot;No peace with Huerta&quot;.President Wilson was making a mistake as to the temper ofour people, and it was desirable that it should be conveyed to him privately   possibly as Lord Reading&apos;s personal view  (i) That he was weakening the moral of theAllies by dragging on the negotiations 1on unessential points on .which the&apos; Ger-mans had accepted his terms, which made our people infer that peace was immedi-ately obtainable:(ii) That he was strengthening the moral ofthe Germans, who had accepted the firstNote and the second Note, and who, ifasked to accept a third Note, wouldargue that they were being trifled with,and would be driven into the hands ofthose who wanted to carry on a war ofdefence,It was important to convey to President Wilson that what hethought was really strengthening our moral was weakening it,and what he thought was weakening German moral was,   in ouropinion,  strengthening it *Mr Bonar Law doubted whether the effect in germany had been as described by Mr Chamberlain.The Prime Minister said he had that morning seen
M. Albert Thomas, who had confirmed Mr Chamberlain&apos;s views.M. Thomas had spoken of the unfavourable effect of the nego-tiations on the French soldiers,  and also on German exileslike Dr. Muhlon, and others who were in touch with the Minority Socialists.    The attitude of the latter was stiffeningagainst the Allies, because they were beginning to believethat all the Allies wanted to crush Germany absolutely.Mr Bonar Law asked whether it was not desirable tosuggest a line of policy to the President, namely, that heshould, insist on the importance of the enemy recognising the military supremacy of the Allies, and,  subject to that,should encourage them to send emissaries to Marshal Foch.Mr Chamberlain said he wished that the negotiations should be direct with Marshal Foch,  and there need be no reference to military supremacy.Mr Bonar Law urged that to tell the enemy they might go direct to Marshal Foch was really to carry out PresidentWilson&apos;s policy.Mr Chamberlain thought, on the contrary, that if theenemy went direct to Marshal Foch,then certain essentialissues would be raised and answered at once.Mr Bonar Law thought it was not possible to expect the enemy to send emissaries to Marshal Foch direct andentirely to ignore President Wilson&apos;s second Note. He wasalso inclined to think that the War Cabinet should cormmni-cate with the French Government on the subject.The War Cabinet decided that  The Prime Minister&apos;s Secretariat should arrange for the publication in the&quot;Times&quot; of a statement traversing theline taken by the Washington Gorres- -   &quot;correspondent, and giving extracts from the speeches of the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairsindicating the misleading character ofthe &quot;Times&quot; article.(3) Mr Balfour said that a telegram had been receivedfrom Lord Derby stating that M. Clemenceau was annoyed with
President Wilson&apos;s reply to the Austrian overtures for peace,    The French Press were now apparently loudly pro-testing against the break-up of Austria, because it would add a number of Germans in Austria to the German Empire.This was surprising, at this stage, when it was rememberedthat the French had been at  one with, us in the declarationswhich had been made concerning Bohemia, the Yugo-Slavs, andin promising a portion of Hungary to Roumania.The Prime Minister pointed out that apparentlyPresident Wilson was siiggesting that there should be noarmistice with Austria, and he was doing this without con-suiting the Allies who were fighting on the Austrian front,notwithstanding that the Americans had no substantial forcefighting there.Mr Balfour said that President Wilson7s line was rather that he would not recommend an armistice to hisAllies except on certain conditions.The Prime Minister said that that attitude was hardlyfair to the Allies, because it put them in the position of.possibly having to reject the President&apos;s proposals,  or else of insisting that the President  should not make them without consultation.Bord Reading, while  recognising the difficulty of conducting negotiations with the President at a distance,emphasized the importance of keeping on good terms with thePresident to the end.The Prime Minister suggested that, in order to keepin close touch with the French,  someone should visit M.  Cle-menceau before the arrival of the American Representative.Lord Milner thought that the Prime Minister himselfought to see M. Clemenceau. sThe Prime Minister said that he would probably haveto go to Versailles next week, and therefore someone elsemight go to Paris this week.
fil?nS&quot;V&quot;ER!rURES     (4)     Mr. Balfour reported that M, Clemenceau wasobjecting to a British Admiral commanding the Fleetfcipand 0 which it was intended to send to Constantinople if theliUerr aneanie ,  Turks surrendered.     He understood that a reasonedstatement on the subject was being sent from Paris.Early in the war, it was true, we had handed over theHaval Command of the Mediterranean to the French.    he wished to ascertain the views of the Admiralty as towhether any compromise were possible,  something in thenature of a double command, if the French should insist on a French Admiral.Admiral Wemyss said it was most undesirable to hand over to the French the command of the Fleetwhich entered Constantinople.     He pointed out that,during the whole of the Gallipoli Campaign the operations were under British Admirals,    and the French Commander-in-Ghief did no more than pay a short visit to the BritishAdmirals.     His functions had been to prevent the AustrianFleet coming out of the Adriatic.    In reply to a question,Admiral Wemyss stated that he had no objection to French,Italian, Greek and other Allied ships entering Constan-tinople with the British Fleet, provided they were ailcommanded by a British Admiral.      The Greek ships were at present under the Coammand of our Admiral.     TheFrench Admiral, who had been sent to the eastern mediterranean to help us to cope with the forces inthe Black Sea, had only got some six old ships.    The workof mine-sweeping, which would take about four days, wouldbe done by the British.     He felt.strong objections to anything in the nature of a dual control.toHICATIGE (5)    With reference to War Cabinet 489A, Minute 3,IERENCH MUD ; &apos;I^lAH GOVEKI- Admiral Wemyss saj^d that he had received a telegram fromthe British Haval Commander-in-Chief at Mudros asking whether he was authorised to inform the French Admiral
as to the terms of the Armistice with Turkey, andwhether the War Office were informing Generals Allenbyand Milne.Mr. Balfour said that so far the only communicationhad been through the Admiralty.   He had arranged thatthe Admiralty telegram should be sent to our represent-atives at Paris and Rome, with, instructions that it wasnot to be communicated to their Governments at this stage.The Secretary said that he understood that thedecision on the,previous day had been not that theAdmiralty telegram should be communicated, but that a communication should beramade to the effect that anapplication for an Armistice had been received.The War Cabinet decided that -The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should transmit the following telegram to paris and Rome:-&quot;British Government have been approached by Turkish Government and have authorisedBritish Admiral Commanding-in-Chief at Mudrosto discuss Armistice with accredited Turkishrepresentative.We have told our Admiral to obtain, ifpossible, all the conditions suggested at versailles, but in our judgment, the immediate and complete opening of Dardanelles andBosphorus, and secure access to Black Sea, areof such paramount importance and so obviouslycarry everything else with them, that, if hecan obtain these, he may accept Armistice atonce.Blease inform your Government.&quot;    (Notparaphrased).MS OF (6)   With reference to War Cabinet 489A, Minute 3,;stice.the Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that inAccordance with the request of the War Cabinet on theprevious day, he had, together with the First Sea Lord,prepared a Paper on the Conditions of an Armistice with turkey, suitable for despatch to Admiral Calthrop (G.T.6068).0 Circulated at the Meeting to Ministers present.
They had taken the conditions h  as laid down at versailles, and agreed to by the French and Italians,and had arranged them in the order of importance.There were twenty-four in all, but if we secured thefirst four, the remaining twenty could be cut out,without serious loss.    He presumed the Admiral wouldse cure as many points as possible, would then wire usstating what he had obtained, and asked for our agreement.   He could not cut out most of the termswithout consulting the French or Italians.lord Ourzon said it was important that the admiral should know whether or not he was free tojettison Bos. 5 to 24.    If he knew that, his naturalinclination would be to do so.    Some of the pointsincluded in ITos. 5 to 24 shams seemed to be of some military importance,  and the Admiral would not have any military advice available.    Was&apos; it desirable inour own Interests to throw the decision so completelyinto the hands of the Admiral?Mr. Chamberlain said he interpreted GeneralWilson1s view as being that if the first three points were secured , we should be satisfied from a military point of view.    The fourth point dealing: with prisonerswas politically essential.General Wilson concurred in this statement ofthe position.Mr. Barnes said that it was important to, carrythr French with us and therefore desirable to tellwhatthem/we were about to do.Lord Milner said it was perhaps inevitable, butunfortunate that we had to forward such a long list of conditions to the Admiral, but if we waited before takinaction in order to consult the French, Italian and GreekGovernments,  so many representations would be made, andconditions suggested as to involve Very serious delay.
The Prime Minister urged, that delay was the one thing to he avoided.   Vie were entitled tontake action.    We hadhalf a million troops involved - a number vastly greaterthan that of any of the Allies.    In fact, -practicallythe whole of the forces employed against Turkey were british forces.    In the case of Bulgaria the French had taken, a linesimilar to that now proposed.    In his view, the Admiralshould make his Bargain, getting&apos; all he could, hut in anycase the first four conditions and as many mojser as he was able.    At the same time we should tell the French and Italianswhat we were doing.ationAdmiral berayss referred to highly secret informing:received from an entirely reliable source to the effect thatthe German Government had been informed that the Turks were seeking a separate Peace, and that German^ was threatened withthe possibility of an unconditional surrender on the part ofThe War Cabinet decided that -The Admiralty should send the following message to the British admiral Commanding-in-Chief atMhdros:-&quot;Some weeks ago, when it seemed likely thatthe Turks would approach us with proposals for peace and an Armistice, we agreed with Franceand Italy that, while terms of Peace would needlong consideration, an Armistice might be concluded by any of the three Powers, to whichthe Turkish Government might make advances onthe following conditions.    These paragraphs arearranged in order of importance.(Insert Conditions).It is necessary for you to bear these conditionsin mind and as far as possible to attain them,if only to enable us to satisfy the French and italians that we have done our best to proceed onthe lines mutually agreed.    But in our opinion thefirst four conditions are of such paramount importance, and, if completely, carried out willso inevitably make us master of the situation,that we do not wish you to jeopardise obtainingthem and obtaining them quickly, by insisting-unduly on all or any of the rest, or indeed by raisHany particular one of the remaining: twenty, if&apos;&apos; you think it might endanger your success in getting the vital four points&quot;,  (lot paraphrased).
Return of Turkish Emissaries to Constantinople.

(7) The War Cabinet requested the First Sea Lord to ascertain precisely from Admiral Calthrop what action he had taken on the telegram sent to him on the previous day, dealing with the return of the Turkish Emissaries to Constantinople.

Troops Available for Gallipoli                                                                 (8) General Smutts asked whether transport was available for the conveyance of land forces from Egypt and Salonica to Gallipoli should it be required. He understood that there were three Divisions in Egypt free.

ADMIRAL WEMYSS replied that there were a large number of Monitors and other craft available at Mudros, and that transport was already assembled in connection with General Milne&apos;s operations, which could if circumstances changed, be utilised to transport troops to Gallipoll instead of Dedeagatch.

THE CHIEF OF THIS IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that there were a considerable number of troops at Salonica under General Milne who would be available for removal to Gallipoli if that were found necessary. He agreed with Secretary&apos;s suggestion that it was politically and sentimentally important that Australian and New Zealand forces should co-operate in any occupation of Gallipoli that was contemplated.

Publicity.                                                                                    (9) The F. M. suggested that it might be desirable to make some announcement in a day or two with regard to the Turkish overtures.




MR. BALFOUR said that the position in Turkey was still very ambiguous, and that a telegram had been received on the previous day which stated that Enver and Talaat were still in power and that the persons who had approached us did not fact represent the real government. That matter would be cleared up when the accredited envoy appeared.

ADMIRAL WEMYSS said that a rumour had reached him that Enver was going over to the Senussi.

MR. BALFOUR said that General Townshend laid great stress on our giving financial assistance to the Turks, and he (Mr. Balfour) understood that the Treasury were not unfriendly to the proposal. It might be desirable that the British Admiral should be free to hint that we were prepared to render what assistance we could - should the Admiral find that a useful weapon in the negotiations.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to examine this suggestion from the standpoint of the Treasury.

Turkish Prisoners of War.

(10) MR. BALFOUR raised the question of the Fourth Condition in the Armistice Terms, viz:-

"All Allied prisoners of war and Armenian interned persons and prisoners to be collected in Constantinople and handed over unconditionally to the Allies."

He presumed that, if the Turks asked that in return Turkish prisoners in our hands should be released, we should refuse, but that might be willing to release an equivalent number ex our prisoners in return far the British prisoners released by them.

THE WAR CABINET were agreed that the Fourth Condition should be interpreted in this sense.



General Townshend(11) THE WAR CABINET decided that: General Townshend should be allowed to return home, and that the necessary action should be taken by the Admiralty.


Communication of information by Admiral Calthrop to Vice Admiral.

(12) THE FIRST SEA LORD asked for instructions of the War Cabinet with regard to the information which the British Admiral Commanding-in-Chief at Mudros should communicate to the French Vice-Admiral at Mudros.

MR. CHAMBERLAIN suggested that the French Admiral could be told that he would doubtless be informed by his own Government in due course as to the character of the negotiations.

LORD CURZON urged that the important point to secure was that the Turkish Emissaries should not be told the proposed Armistice Terms before they returned to Constantinople. Our Admiral should be warned not to communicate these terms to the emissaries.

After further consideration, THE WAR CABINET decided that :-

(1) the Admiralty should send the following telegram immediately by the quickest means possible to the British Admiral at Mudros :-

"You may inform French Admiral of what is going on if you think desirable. We are informing French Government who will no doubt inform his fully."

(Not paraphrased)

(2) after an interval the telegram dealing with the Armistice Terms (Minute 6) should be sent.

Possibilities Resulting from an Armistice or a Peace with Turkey.

(13) THE WAR CABINET took note of a paper dated 21st October, 1918, which had been prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff dealing with the possibilities opened up by an Armistice or a Peace with Turkey (G.T.6069).

Circulated at the Meeting to the Ministers present.
