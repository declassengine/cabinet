In theoriginal Condition the word &quot;Turkish&quot; was not mentionedwith reference  to the ports in which these vessels should be interned, and it had been considered then thatthey should    be brought out from Turkish ports and in-terned in ports bcloning to the allies in the Mediterran-ean.    As well as the GOEBEN, the Turks had some gooddestroyers, and. it might be assumed that Turkey desiredto retain these as part of her peace Terms.This clause hac! boon altered from &quot;The occupation by Allied troops of important strategical points&quot; to &quot;TheAllies to have the right to occupy any strategical points in the event of any situation arising which threatens thesecurity of the ^llies0&quot;An addition had been made to this clause, addingthe words &quot;Similar conditions to apply to Turkish meroan-tile shipping in Turkish waters for purpose of trade and&apos;the demobilization of the array*&quot;This clause, which originally dealt with thedemands for the use of xks: Gone tan binople as a naval base for the Allies and for the use of all shipping

(  L j affairs &apos;&quot; \i t;\a %h J4v  ----------- -.l NOTE.    The following telegram was approved by Lord Curzon-  w /and despatched to Vice-Admiral Galthorpe:-I   i  &apos; The War Cabinet desire to congratulate you on your-   Hable and successful handling of the negotiations with&apos; .    :, /...

The far Cabinet then proceeded to consider telegram 595*2.dealing with the XKmttai remarks of some of the clauses ofthe armistice , which had been transmitted by Vice-admiral calthorpe at the request of the Turkish delegates.rj jg 1 (a) The Turkish delegates had requested that a very small&apos; number of Turkish soldiers might be allowed to remainwhen the forts were occupied, as a concession to the honour of Turkey and an indication of the will of the.; Allies.     It was generally agreed that it was essentialthat the Turkish flag should be hauled down from allTurkish $forts, and that the retention of even a small number of Turkish soldiers in the forts would be mostinadvisableo;,El.(b) The second request of the Turkish delegates wasthat, if it could be possibly avoided, no Greek man-of-war might go to Constantinople or Smyrna.   The delegates had said that they could arrange for any Greek Destroyersrequired for operations in the Blaok Sea to pass throughthe -dosphorus at night.     In this connection admiralfremantle said that the First Sea Lord had already tele-graphed to Vice-Admiral Calthorpe saying that he hoped itwas possible for him to arrange for a Greek ship or ships to go up the straits with him.       Lord Robert Ceoilexpressed the opinion that it was important that the requestof the delegates with regard to Smyrna should be complied with.       The Italian Govensament would feel very stronglyif any Greek forces went to Smyrna,ft 4. With regard to this Clause as agreed upon, the delegates had explained that it would be much simpler for both sides if allied prisoners of war in remote places were handed over to the nearest Allied Commander instead ofbeing collected at Constantinople.
It was generally agreed that this suggestion of the delegates would &quot;be in the better interest of the prisonersthemselves, and that all arrangements possible should bemade for their release at the earliest ^isMe moment.The delegates asked that there might be no questionsof occupying   Constantinople unless some definite necessityarose, such as the failure of the Turkish Govemme nt tomaintain order or protect the persons and property of alliedsubjectSo     lord Robert Cecil   said that he had understooodthat previously an intimation had been given to the TurkishtheGovernment, at Paris9 that it was not/intention to occupyConstantinople itself provided that an immediate armisticewas concludedo     Personally, he was strongly in favour of occupying the city if the Allies were not pledged against it,       lord Curaon expressed the opinion that the landing of Troops in the Capital of Turftey would be a most desirablethingo     Such an action would be the surest indication to every Turk that he had been beaten, and, while not advocatingthis adbsresiig course from any Naval or Military considerationhe advocated it very strongly from the point of view of thementality of the Easts   The Secretary of State for India,whilst agreeing that Constantinople should be occupied, urgedthat, if this were done, the Allied Governmehts should renewtheir assurances as to the protection of all Holy PlaoesoThe delegates asked that, in the case of garrisons whichare surrounded by Arabs, mfcg the nearest British Generalmight make arrangments for the transfer of surrenderedprisoners to British hands as soon as possible, as they jgg&amp;akfeared ill-treatment from the Arabs.
7.a*The opinion was expressed that no objection should betaken to this proposalB and that, as It was most desirablethat Mosul should be occupied by the British force,General Marshall should send a detachment to Mosul toaccept the surrender of the Turkish garrison.&apos;1 19. The delegates on this claxise raised the point thatthe evacuation of certain specified German and Austriancivilians connected with financial and industrial affairs in Turkey would completely dislocate finance and commercialstability.
and requested that these persons might be allowed to remain under the responsibility of the Turkish Government*It was unanimously agreed that this proposal must be completely rejected0The delegates asked that a British Mission might besent to Armenia to investigate the conditions there, andthat this clause should not be published, as it might encourage the Armenian revolutionaries to extrememeasures^It was agreed that there was no objection to thisproposaloThe War Cabinet decided that &amp;(1) Lord Curzon and the Assistant Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should prepare anddespatch a telegram to the Prime Minister, inParis, informing him that the War Cabinet hadcarefully considered the conditions of armistice and the proposals of the Turkish delegates, ascontained in telegrams Nos9 593 Z* and 595 ZSs,and were of opinion that *(a) With reference to clause 1, no Turkishsoldiers should be allowed to remain in the occupied Fortse(b) Also with reference to clause 1, it wasadvisable that no Greek men^oiVwar shouldbe sent to Smyrna, and preferable that noneshould go to Constantinople:(c) With reference to clause 4, all stepspossible and practicable should b e taken tomake arrangements for the most expeditiousreturn of Allied prisoners in Turkishhands  (See decision below):(d) With reference to clause 7, it was desirablethat Constantinople should be occupied bythe Allied Forces, but that an assuranceshould be given with reference to the holy places In that City:(e) With reference to clause 16, it was agreedthat the proposals of the Turkish delegates should be accepted (See decision below):(f) With reference to clause 1HWt the proposalsof the Turkish delegates on this point shouldbe totally rejected:(g) With reference to clause 24, the proposalsof the Turkish delegates should be accepted,but that the clause should be published^(2)The Secretary of State for Home Affairs should draft a telegram, for the approval of lord curzon, for communication to Vice**admiral calthorpe, agreeing with the proposals of theTurkish delegates with reference to clause 4Sand urging that the Allied prisoners of war in turkish hands should be released in the mostexpeditious manner possibles
(3) The Deputy Chief of the Naval staff should telegraph, to Vice-admiral calthorpe with reference to Clause4, instructing him to give every facility, by means of the despatchof men-of-war to all Turkish portspossible, to assist in the earliestreturn of Allied prisoners of war.(4) The Director of Military Intelligenceshould send a telegram to general marshall, instructing him to despatch a force without delay to Mosul, inorder to accept the surrender of theTurkish gar ris on there.(5)  The Director of Military Intelligenceshould send copies/of telegrams Nos.593 Z. and 59 5 Z. to General Allenby.(6)  The Secretary of State for India should telegraph the Conditions of the Armis-tice to the Viceroy of India.jjuncement (S) The War Cabinet had under consideration a messagehe Housesparliament .which had been telephoned from Versailles, which the PrimeMinister desired should be made in the House of Commons,with reference to the Armistice with Turkey.Sir George  Cave undertook to make the announcement that afternoon, after Questions, and asked for instructions as to what steps he should take if Supplementary questions were put to him on many points which might be raised, suchas the protection which was to be given to Armenians,and the occupation or Constantinople.
The War Cabinet decider1 that  It san inadvisable that the Secretaryof 3tetc for Home Affairs should replyto any Supplementary questions, butthat if the question of the protection to be given under the Armistice toArmenians w,s raised, he should he authorised to satisfy the House ofCommons on that point.(3) Lord, our a on said that the Secretary of Statefor Home Affairs had stated in the. House of Oassoas,during the Debate on prisoners of War, which took placeon October 89th. that he had a list of about 40 Bassesof Germans who had been guilty of the greatest atrocitiesin respect to our prisoners of war, and that it was intendedby the Allied Governments to bring these men to trial.It was therefore desirable that arrangements should becade now oe to the formation of a Tribunal.   At a previousWar Cabinet Hooting the Attorney-General had received instructions to prepare the British case and to advise as to theconstitution of the Court.    If tho armistice terms mergedinto peace terms it would be necessary to take action ia-iaediately, and Lord Our a on suggested that a t&amp;legram shouldbe sent to the prime Minister reminding him of the promisesmade in the House of Com one.Sir George Cave urged that it was very necessarythat the intention of the Government on this question shouldbe included in the Conditions of Armistice end not in the -Peace Terms.The War Cabinet decided that  fa) The Secretary of State for Hoar? affairs should coaaunicatc with the Attorney-General on the question.(b) The Assistant Secretary of state forForeign Affairs should send a telegram to the prime Minister reminding him ofthe desirability of this question be lagincluded in the Conditions of armistice.i&amp;ll Gardens, S.W.)otober, 1913*
