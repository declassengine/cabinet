WAR CABINET 428A.



DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing St., S.W., on FRIDAY, June 7, 1918, at 11-30 a.m.



LETTER FROM GENERAL FOCH TO FIELD-MARSHAL SIR DOUGLAS HAIG.



The Director of Military Intelligence read to the War Cabinet extracts from a letter he had received from General DuCane, in which the latter stated that he had, on the previous day, taken a letter from General Foch to the British Commander-in-Chief asking him, in view of the imminence of an attack on the Montdidier-Noyon front, to make the necessary preparations to come to the assistance of the French with all his available reserves. General Foch had also charged General DuCane to explain to the Commander-in-Chief that he had no intention of acting so imprudently as to withdraw reserves from the British zone until it was quite clear that the bulk of Prince Rupprecht&apos;s reserves were committed to action South of the Somme. General Foch also said that he had not asked for more than five Divisions of Americans to go into the French Zone. General DuCane had stated that General Petain had asked that as many Divisions as possible to the IXth Corps should be reconstituted in the French zone.

The Prime Minister said that he had talked to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the telephone yesterday evening, who had said that he had no knowledge of this information.
