DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street, S.W., on MONDAY, JULY 22nd 1918, at 12 noon.



AFFORESTATION.



(1) With reference to War Cabinet 411 Minute 17 the War Cabinet had before them the following documents:-



Report by Lord Curzon and Mr. Barnes (G. 215).

Resolution of the Royal Scottish Agricultural Society, (G.T. 5063).

Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction, (G. 216).

Memorandum by the President, Board of Agriculture, (G.T. 5121).



Lord Curzon and Mr. Barnes indicated the main recommendations in their Report (G.215), and the reasons why they had been made. The most important proposal was the establishment of a Central Forest Authority for the United Kingdom, such authority to make such arrangements for local administration in the different parts of the United Kingdom, as it might be thought desirable. It was pointed out that any attempt to disturb the forestry branch of the Scottish Board of Agriculture would meet with strenuous opposition from the Secretary for Scotland, and if the national cry were raised it might lead to considerable political agitation in Scotland. On the other hand, all forestry experts were agreed that the Scottish Board of Agriculture was unfitted to develop and administer an adequate policy of afferestation.



The suggestion that the Central Control of forest policy should be vested in the Development Commission did not meet with favour.

In view of the doubt expressed as to how the proposals of the Report would be received in Scotland, the War Cabinet decided to ask Mr. Pratt to report on the subject.
