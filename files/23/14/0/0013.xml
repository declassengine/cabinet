WAR CABINET 390 A.



DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W., on MONDAY, April 22nd, 1918, at 12 noon.



(1) The War Cabinet had a discussion in regard to the continuation or otherwise of the neutrality of Holland.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that on Saturday he had received a pressing telegram from Sir W. Townley intimating that what was practically tantamount to an ultimatum had been received by Holland from Germany. It was obvious that very likely this was a case of bluff on the part of Germany.

Mr. Balfour had conferred with the First Sea Lord and General Maurice on the subject and as a result telegram. No. 881 had been sent on April 20th to the Hague. On the 21st Mr. Balfour had heard that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff disagreed with the last sentence of the telegram to Sir W. Townley, which read : "If, however, the "Germans should make it clear that they would regard a "refusal by the Netherland Government to permit the passage "of sand and gravel as a ?, and the Dutch "Government should ask your advice as to what they had "better do, you should tell them that if they really "cannot prolong resistance without going to war with "Germany, we should not be disposed to regard as unneutral "their submission in such circumstances to German demands."

After conversation with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Mr. Balfour had sent a fresh telegram to Sir W. Townley instructing him not to act on the last sentence without consulting the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.




General Smuts, who had previously investigated the question of the smaller neutrals on behalf of the War Cabinet (Paper G. 153), said that he thought Mr. Balfour&apos;s last telegram not the point. His Committee had come to the conclusion that it was not in our interest that the smaller neutrals should be forced into the war. The position under review, however, was now different inasmuch as it was new a question of Germany forcing Holland into the war. On the suggestion being made that if Germany could spare troops to attack Holland, the Allies could also spare troops to defend Holland, Mr. Balfour stated that the Director of Military Operations had estimated that Germany could find troops to seize the south of the Schelt including Walcheren, and also the undefended parts of Holland. With regard to the Naval side of the question the First Sea Lord said that from a naval point of view it was not desirable that Holland should enter the war on our side. There could hardly be any question of her entering the war against us because she would thereby have to face the loss of her possessions in the West Indies, but if she came in on our side there seemed no possibility of our preventing the Germans from using the Schelt. Dutch neutrality alone kept the Germans from using the Schelt.

On the other hand it was pointed out that if the Dutch joined the Allies there would be an increase in the number of troops fighting Germany. We could also supply guns, machine guns, and aeroplanes to help the Dutch.

The War Cabinet decided :-

(a) That the military side of this question should be referred to the Supreme War Council at Versailles for examination.

(b) That General Smuts&apos; Committee should examine the naval, military and political aspects of the case.




That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to Sir W. Townley in the sense that the whole question was being reconsidered.

Dunkirk (2) The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T. 4000) in which it was pointed out that the military situation at the present time was such that the possibility of leaving Dunkirk must be seriously considered and that the means by which we could reduce its value to the enemy as a naval base must be prepared.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had been in consultation with the First Sea Lord and had decided that the general arrangements for rendering the port useless should be in his hands. They had also come to the conclusion that the actual order for commencing the work of demolition must be left to the Field-Marshall Commanding-in-Chief in France, since he alone would be in a position to decide the moment at which the military situation necessitated the execution of the scheme.

Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had discussed the situation matter with General Foch, and the latter agreed to the necessity for making all preparations, and for carrying out the necessary demolitions, but inasmuch as the destruction of a French port is involved, he considered that the matter was one which was outside his competence, and must be decided between the representative Governments.

It therefore seemed necessary that the French Government should be asked to authorize Field-Marshall Sir Douglas Haig to carry out the necessary demolitions at his discretion if and when the emergency arose.

The War Cabinet sanctioned this proposal, and asked the Secretary of State for War to take the necessary action.



British Representative to meet M. Trotski

The War Cabinet had under consideration a telegram from Mr. Lockhart No. 99, in regard to the proposed meeting between M. Trotski and a representative of the British Government in the near future at Murmansk.

The War Cabinet were of opinion that it was desirable that some emissary should go in order to discuss with M. Trotski the reorganisation of Russia for military purposes.

The War Cabinet requested :-

(a) General Smuts to undertake the mission, and asked him to let them have his reply after consideration, the following day.

(b) In the event of General Smuts acceptance, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send a telegram to Russia asking if M. Trotski will arrange his visit in order to meet a member of the War Cabinet at Murmansk.
