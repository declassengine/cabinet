/1 7 01 i b(The Meeting of the War^Cabinet lasted, with hrief-intervals, from noon until 6.15 Pom.    The diseus-sions did not take place exactly in the order inwhich they are given below, as it was necessaryto break off the discussion on particular subjectsat intervals either for the preparation of draft telegrams, &amp;c., or during the absence on parlia-mentary duties or otherwise of particular Minis-ters.    For purposes of record, however, it hasbeen thought more convenient to group the record of the discussions of particular subjects, show-ing, as far as possible, the points at which theinterruptions occurred.)SffilA. (1) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reportedlie Milit-   that General allenby cavalry had occupied Hama, which isary Situ-ation. north of Horns, and some 65 miles from Aleppo.    The TurkishArmy, under General Liman von Sanders, was reported to beentrenching a few miles south of Aleppo.    The General Staffestimated the enemyTs forces at Aleppo at from 18,000 to25,000 men.    At a later stage of the meeting, in reply to questions, he stated that General Allenby was not likelyto attempt the capture of Aleppo until he was sure of tak-ing it, and it might take him two or three weeks to secure this condition.    The bulk of the stores from Constantinoplefor Mesopotamia and the Turkish front in Persia, were sentvia Aleppo, so that its capture would be of great importance.6S0POTAICLA.    (2) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated thatGeneral Marshal was pushing on as far as he could towardsMosul, but was hampered by transport considerations.    Atpresent, his forces were some 130 to 140 miles from Mosul.53E TURKISH     (3) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a&amp;0E OVER-55RES. telegram which was received during the meeting: in regard toTurkish overtures, transmitted from the British Admiral inthe Horth Aegean, to whom it had been communicated by GeneralTownshend.    The text of the telegram is given in ths AppendsIo    A second telegram from the British Vice-Consul at
180Mityleho stated that General [Dovmshend and two officers,with an aide-de-camp of the Turkish Minister of&apos;Marine, had arrived from Smyrna, and proceeded to London, via Mudros,,According to his information, they were empowered to negotiations-ate for peace.Mr. Balfour explained that General Townshend, afterheing taken prisoner at Kut-el-Amara, had since been paradedabout in Turkey, although he had been treated in a consider-ate and even luxurious fashion. W&amp;Uf t*U*. ^M^tAtdAdmiral Wemyss ^stated that the British Admiral in the Aegean, under instructions from him9 had detained GeneralTownshend at Mitylene.The Prime Minister commented on the fact that the pre-liminary telegrams regarding A.admiral 2ownshendrs release,which had been received at the Admiralty on the previous day,had not been communicated at once to himQMr. Balfour said that the Turks, in suggesting theconditions of peace, were undoubtedly bluffing,    nevertheless he thought they might be satisfied if they were assured ofthe retention of Constantinople, and that Turkey would re-main an independent State.    It was of great importance that we should secure a free passage for the Fleet throughthe Straits to Constantinople and the Black Sea.firstAdmiral Weroyss said that the/condition of a free pass-age through the Straits was to be sure that the forts on either side of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus co^^ld not beused against rti ^o IhudfcThe Prime Minister pointed out that if this overturewas a serious one, it was very important to take action atonce.    Moreover, the action should, if possible, be takenby the British, and not by the French.    In Paris we had agreed to the terms of an armistice, and in the conversa-tions there the French had shown that they were anxious to
1 8 iget any negotiations into the hands of General ffranehetdrEsperey.    For example, they had refused to agree that aBritish Admiral should command the Fleet which made thepassage of the Dardanelles.    He had since written a letterto M. Clemenceau on this subject, which had been eiroulat-ed to the War Cabinet (Grog. 6016) , and although a finalanswer had not yet been received, as Ivt. Clemenceau was awayat the fronts nevertheless, the British.Ambassador in Parishad made it clear that M. Clemenceau did not favour theidea.Lord Curzon pointed out that the terms for an armist-ioe agreed on at Paris were very different from the termsof peace suggested by the Turks.    He suggested that our re-ply should be in the sense that the first step was an arm-istioecLord Eilner esgpressed the view that an armistice de-manded on the TFea^sadrlries&apos; terms/would have the effect of/iybreaking off the Turkish overtures0Lord Curzon reminded the. War Cabinet that the line taken up^now in regard to all Turkish overtures was that wemust have an accredited representative oz  the de factoTurkish Government to deal with.   One of the first steps,therefore, was to make quite clear that we could only dealwith such a representative.Mr* Bonar La?; suggested that, having regard to the factthat we were now dealing with a new Turkish Government whoy/ere very favourably inclined to this country, the terms ofan armistice drawn up at Paris were too stiff.   He suggest-ed it would be worth while to accord an armistice on theterms of the free and secure passage of the Straits alone,which would really give us all that we required.The Prime Minister suggested for consideration thatwe should authorise the British Admiral in the Aegean to    &quot;&quot;&quot;4.

He pointed out that many of theterms of an 8,rmistice with Turkey drawn up at Paris weremilitary in character.    He questioned whether the Admiral,who was not well versed in the situation, would be the bestnegotiator in these circumstances, and suggested that per-haps some Military Officer should be associated -ated with him.Mr. Barne&amp;suggested that General Allenby might be soassociated.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that if we obtained free and secure access to the Black Sea, turkey would be completely at our mercy.    He would be fully pre-pared to accept an armistice on these terms, provided thatwe had full power to pass troops through the Black Sea to roumania,or Russia,or the Caticasus, or whithersoever weIn reply to Lord Ourzon he said: he was not afraid Ofhampering General.

In these circumstances, he did not consider itnecessary to associate a Military Officer with the $avalCommander-in-Chief of the. Aegean.Jt,.. ...  -L&quot; J\ itThe Prime Minister^&apos;, in this connection, pointed outthat if a Military Qfficer was sent at all the natural sel-ection would be General Franchet d^Bsperey, who was muchnearer to Mudros than General Allenby.

Orlando which he had prepared, setting out the broad conclusions of the War Cabinet, as he under-stood them, up to this point.    The draft began by rehears-ing the fact that General Townshend had been released bythe Turkish Government, and sent with a message asking forterms of peace; these terms, however, were unacceptable;from the tenor of the message we ha,d received, however, we thought that an armistice might be obtained, includingcomplete free and secure success to Constantinople and the black Seal the advantages or  this were then rehearsed; thedraft concluded by suggesting that, unless they felt objec-tions, we should instruct the Admiral to negotiate on thebasis of the terms of an armistice drawn xcg in Paris, but should authorise him, if he could not secure all these terms to grant an armistice on the condition of complete free and secure access to Constantinople   and the Black Sea.   At thesame time, Mr. Balfour pointed out that the Turks had not proposed an armistice, but terms of peace, and he felt some-doubt as to whether it would be right entirely to ignorethis demand.Lord Milner associated himself with this point of view.He questioned whether it would be prudent te turn a per-perfectly deaf ear to the Turks at a time when they were asking
185for peace and friendship.    He suggested that they shouldhe given some encouragement, and that some account shouldhe taken of their approaches, which were practically tan-tamount to an offer to come to our sideaShe Prime Minister, in support of this point of view,pointed out that the new Turkish Government was thoroughlyanti-German in character.    He felt it would be prudent togive them some hope, and not to treat them exactly as though we were dealing with Enver pasha.    He reminded hiscolleagues that the conditions of an armistice had been drawn up on this latter assumption.lord Milner reminded the War Cabinet of the precedent of the French action in regard to Bulgaria, as having been successful in the rapid conclusion of a very favourablearmistice.General Smuts said&apos;that he was particularly anxiousto avoid discussion of these terms with France and Italyat this stage.    He suggested that an answer should be sentin the&apos; sense that the terms of peace must stand over forthe present,&apos; but that we were willing to arrange the termsof an armistice.   As a preliminary to this, however, weshould require the Turks to open up the Dardanelles andBosphorns, and give us free and secure access to the black sea.    If they would satisfy this preliminary condition, wewould then discuss with them the terms of an armistice. Hewould also notify the Turks that we were willing to assist them in getting rid of the 20,000 Germans reported to bein Constantinople and the naval forces there.   To enable us to do this, however, the Straits must be opened as a tok-en of good faith.Mr. Balfour laid stress on no hope being held out tothe Turks that the terms of peace which they asked for could
be granted; for example, we must not let them keep the idea that we should permit them to hold Turkish sovereignty ov-er tlie occupied territory.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the best reply would bethat we cannot make peace at present, but can discuss theterms of an armistice with an accredited representative ofthe Turkish Government sent&apos; to Lemnos for that purpose. Ecrthe moment he would not alter the terms of an armisticedrawn up at Paris, but,if necessary, after the negotiations had commencedj we could authorise the Admiral to vary them.Our Allies should, of course, be informed of the action wehad taken, but if this plan were adopted, it would not benecessary to tell them at this stage that the terms of thearmistice might be varied.    This would come later when theoccasion arose.(The subject was adjourned at this point to..enable Lord Milner, in coneert with the first sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, to draft a telegram to the Uaval Com-mander-in-Chief of the Aegean for the consid-eration of the War Cabinet.    In the intervalother subjeots,recorded in the later Minutes,were discussed.    The War Cabinet resumed con-sideration of this question late in the after-noon as recorded below).Admiral Wemyss read a telegram he had just receivedfrom the British Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, who hadbeen ordered to the ITorth Aegean.    The gist of this wasthat the Admiral was assured by General Townshend that theTurkish Government are most anxious to negotiate for peace,but that their hopes and thoughts were centred in England;in his view nothing could be more disastrous to Britishprestige throughout the East, or more calculated to postpone the conclusion of peace with Turkey, than for an allied force to pass through the Dardanelles under any but a british admiral; the effect of a Fleet pi-oceeding to Constantinopleunder French command would be deplorable and very unpopular
naval (4) lord Milner raised the question as to whether, in theTHE event of an agreement with the Turks, the British naval fore-TERH MED-8MAIJEAJI. es in the Eastern Mediterranean were sufficient to cope withthe German forces. Would they he strong enough to overwhelmthe Black Sea Fleet and the wGoehen,??Admiral Wemyss stated that by the time the Straits hadbeen swept for mines and safeguards secured for the passageof the Straitsj there would be, in the Eastern Mediterranean,with the Greeks in Turkey; General Townshend considered thatthe Turks would be prepared to send plenipotentiaries to treat with the British representatives for peace, and would allow the British to take over the Dardanelles defences ifassured of support against the Germans in Turkey and the black Sea0Lord Milner then read a draft of the telegram he pro-posed should be sent by the Admiralty to the British Admiral,Subject to some minor modifications this was agreed to, andthe War Cabinet decided:^(i) That the Admiralty should send a telegram to the. British Comman&amp;er-in-Chief in the mediterranean in the sense that, after consideration of the mes-sage brought by General Townshend from the Turk-ish Government, the British Government would beprepared to consider, in due course, terms of peace,which could not be arranged by Great Britain with--out consulting her Allies; this would take time,but we were prepared to discuss the conditions ofan armistice without delay.    An armistice wouldhave to be concluded promptly if Turkey was to es-cape from further military disasters, and to havethe advantage of British assistance in throwingoff the German yoke.    The Admiral, therefore,should inform the Turkish Government that he was authorised to receive an accredited representative to arrange the terms of an armistice.   A telegramwould be sent on the following day informing him of the conditions of an armistice upon which hewas to insist.    (paraphrase^ from the actual telegram](ii) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should notify the American, French, and Italian Govern-ments that overtures had been made to the british admiral, who had been empowered to discuss the termsof an armisticeo
Ciii) The First Sea lord and the Chief of the ImperiaJLghr. 1       General Staff should carefully re-examine the termsof an armistice with Turkey, drawn up in Paris, and&apos;report their views to the War Cabinet on the follow-ing day0
189  British Dreadnoughts and 2 of the Lord Kelson class.    he anticipated in addition that the French Pre-Dreadnoughts nowat Mudros would accompany the Fleet.    He had also heard thai;the Italians wished to send Z Dreadnoughts to Mudros.    he considered that thl-s/force/would &quot;be sufficient.    A few daysago a bombing attack had been me.de on the ,rGoeben&quot; , which hadretired to Stenia Bay.   Aeroplane reconnaissance showed no signs of any of the Russian Dreadnoughts being in the neigh-bourhood of ConstantinopleoIn reply to Mr. Barnes he said he could not guarantee that the British Dreadnoughts were equal to the &quot;Goeben,T inspeed.Admiral Beatty said that the British Dreadnoughts couldsteam 19 knots, and he doubted whether the ,rGoeben,,;* after all the injuries she had received from time to time, couldexceed this speed.Lord Curzon asked whether we should have the land fore-es required to deal with the situation if, as reported,there Yiexe 20,000 German troops in Constantinople.    could the -Fleet dominate the whole situation?General Wilson said that this would depend largely onthe action of the Turks.    According to Wax Office iiiforma-tion there was 1 German division in Constantinople.    TheTurks, however, had a much larger force than that.. ARMISTICE     (5) Field Marshal Haig, at the request of the Prime Min-:th germahy.ister, read a Memorandum giving his views as to the militaryle Militarynditions   conditions of an armistice with Germany.    (Appendix II).an Armist-In reply to Lord Curzon, he said he had not gone intodetails and would certainly be willing to include the sur-render of British prisoners in the terms of an armistice.
In reply to Mr0 Barnes, he said that, in speaking ofthe 245 mile line, he referred to the German frontier &quot;beforethe War of 1870*Mr, Balfour pointed out an apparent inconsistency inthe Field Marshal&apos;-s terms.    He stated that the Allies hadnot the strength to finish the War this year.    Hence, theobject of an armistice would be to enable them to finish iton better terms nest year.    It had generally been assumed,however, that an armistice would mean the end of the War. he did not see how these conflicting hypotheses could be recon-ciled.    He further pointed out that the Field Marshal&apos;s plangave no security for any terms of peace beyond ensuring theterritory that was occupied by the Allies.    It provided nogauge for obtaining the reparation to Belgium or North france the Prime Minister pointed out that the blockade wouldprovide the gauge0Mr0 Balfour drew attention to a Memorandum which he had circulated, in which he had pointed out that the machineryOf blockade was difficult to work and very unpopular; thatit could not be applied to Germany alone, since it mustnecessarily Involve neutrals who border on Germany, and -f-xrzmthrough whom Germany could import what she wanted; and inwhich, finally, he had questioned whether it would be possi-ble or desirable to continue this artificial system beyondits natural term, merely to compel Germany to pay her debtsand fulfil her other obligations0Mr. Chamberlain asked the Field Marshal whether, sup**posing an armistice were granted on the terms suggested byhim, namely, the occupation of all territory up to the german frontier of 1870, and supposing the negotiations for peacebreak down, say, in January or February, and he was told thathe must begin fighting again; in these conditions, could hesmash the enemy?11 o
Field Marshal Haig said that he would be in a better position than he was now, since the Allies would have pos-session of a large part of the coal and. other sources of munition supplies of the enemy.In reply to a question by Lord Curzon as to whetherthe Army could be induced to fight again at the end of an armistice, he replied that this would depend entirely uponthe object for which we were fighting.Mr. Balfour expressed the view that the French wouldnot fight again.Mr. Barnes pointed out that the enemy, fighting forthe protection of his own country, might put up a strongfight.
I ft  /VJ2IIlfE AMERICAN     (6) There was some discussion at this point as to t^heARMY.value of the American Army next year.    Field Marshal b&amp;igsaid that the American men individually were very good mat-erial.    The Staff, however, were very inexperienced andhardly knew how to feed their troops.    There were two meth-ods of working the American troops, either to keep them to-gether as an army, or to distribute thern among the Allies0If they could be brought in with the Allies, even as divi-sions, it would be possible to get good results from them.The Prime Minister pointed out that the trouble wasthat the French, while criticising the Anericans to xis,wotild never criticise them to their face.    If only marshal foch cotxld be induced to let President Wilson know the truthfrom all the evidence he had he believed that the president would insist on a better utilisation of the American troops.General Wilson read a communication he had received in regard to the position on the American front, which gave a poor account of the efficiency of the American forces,and contained the statement that General Pershing had nowabandoned attacks on a large front and had adopted a systemof attacks on a divisional front only at one time, which he believed was securing good results in losses to the enemy.The War Cabinet agreed that:-Mr0 Balfour should, discuss the matter franklywith Colonel House on his forthcoming visit.BACTION OH       (7) The Prime Minister pointed out that developments inEE WESTERNibBI! OF OP-the Bast might have an important reaction on our prospectsIATIONS OHIB DAHUBE. on the Western front next year.    Field Marshal Haig had formed his Judgment.s  lay an appreciation of the situation on the Western front.    If, however, it was possible to at-tack the enemy from the Danube, the situation might be en-tirely changed, and if Turkey went out of the War the possi-bility of such operations must be envisaged.    The popula-13o tion
of Austria across the Danube would be friendly to the Allies.Could Austria defend herself both on the Italian front endon the Danube?   Already there were prospects that Austriawas breaking up.    Was it not possible that what had happen-ed to Bulgaria might happen to Austria also?   If Austriashould collapse, the Allies might then operate against Ger-many.    Already three-fifths of the population of Austriawere favourable to them.    In Bohemia, on the frontier ofGermany, they would find a population mainly favourable tothem.    Would not that have an enormous influence on the sit-uation in the West?General &quot;Wilson agreed that this would be the case.    he pointed out, however, that it would take some time to create a Danube front as a serious menace to the enemy.    He was convinced that the German governing classes were thinkinga great deal of this.    They had entered this War in the hopethat they would secure command of the sea and the route tothe East.    They had already lost command of the sea, and nowthey had lost their road to the East.    From this point ofview the taking of Dish might be regarded as more important than the capture of Lille.    For these reasons he himself wasin favour of stiffer terms of an armistice than those pro-pounded by the Field Marshal.At the conclusion of the Meeting the War Cabinet decidedthat:-The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should im-mediately prepare,for the consideration of the Warcabinet, a. review of the probable developments ofthe military situation on the Eastern front, on theassumption that Turkey would soon he out of the War;that forces would thereby be set free from Mesepe-tamia and Palestine; that there would be free access to the Black Sea; and that the assistance .of Roumaniacould be secured.(8) Admiral Wemyss, in reply to the Prime Minister as tothe naval conditions of an armistice, said that he had al-ready circulated to the War Cabinet the views of the Board
of Admiralty (0-. S. 6OSS).    He felt that both the naval andmilitary situations ought to be considered together.    he admitted that the terms suggested by the Board of admiralty were so stiff that they were not likely to be accepted, buthe pointed out the great difficulty in reducing them.    Ifthe principle was accepted that hostilities were not likelyto recommence after an armistice had once been declared, itwas necessary that the terms of the armistice should appro:-imate to what it was desired to obtain in the peace.    Shiswas why it was so difficult to out the naval conditionsdown.    So do so might mean that while we had. been victor-ious on shore, we should not reap the fruits of our victoryat sea.    Shis naval victory was no less real because it wasnot spectacular, for the Admiralty claimed by their strat-egy to have imposed their will upon, the enemy.In reply to a question, Admiral Jemyss said that thenaval conditions of an armistice drawn up in conjunctionwith the Military Representatives at Versailles, could notbe considered as final or authoritative from a naval pointof view.    Admiral Hope, who had represented the Admiralty,haibeen called upon to express his views at short notice andwithout knowledge of the views of the Board.    These terms should only be considered as giving a very general idea forthe assistance, at the moment, of the Political Conferencesitting.at the time.    Admiral Wemyss added that he had warn-ed the Allied Naval Conference to be ready to meet whenevernecessary to review the question of the naval terms of anarmistice0He suggested that the Vfar Cabinet should now hear theviews of Admiral Sir David Beatty.ADMIRAL BEASSY. said that, in preparing his list of theships which the enemy should surrender as the naval condi-tions of an armistice, he had based himself on the assump-15c tion
that our object in the War now, as ever before, was to destroy German militarism, that is to say, both the milit-ary and naval power of Germany.    If this was not accom-breakplished, the War might fixag:/out again as soon as the enemy had recovered sufficiently,   like the First Sea Lord, he also based his views on the assumption that hostilitieswere not likely to recommence after an armistice, and con-sequent ly that the terras of an armistice must he as near aspossible to the terms of peace.    Prom a naval point of view it was necessary by these terms to reduce the forces of theenemy to such an extent as to prevent him from reducing our strength,as he had done in the past,by the attacks of hissubmarines,    At an earlier stage of the War the enemy had very nearly achieved victory with his submarines.    He mustnot again be allowed to approach to such a position.    Ifthe enemy was left with the power of building submarines9and with sufficient surface craft to enable those submarinesto put to sea - and submarines could only really be effect-ually dealt with.close to their point of departure - thatis to say, if the enemy was left with sufficient navalpower to protect the nests of his submarines, then he wouldbe as powerful at sea as before.    Sir David Bes/aty associated -ated himself with what Admiral Wemyss had said in regard tothe success of our sea power.    It was true that we had o&quot;o-tained no decisive active victory, but we had achieved apassive victory. Because it was passive there was no reason why the nation should give up the object with which it had entered the War, namely, the destruction of German milite-r-ism.    Admiral Beatty said that the terms he would imposewould include the surrender of 2 out of Germanyys 3 squad-rons of Dreadnoughts; all the German battle cruisers; anumber of light cruisers; 50 of the most modern destroyers;as well as all the stibmarines.    The basis on which he
196calculated the number of Dreadnoughts to be handed over was as follows:- If the Grand Fleet should encounter the HighSea Fleets he honed and expected to accomplish the entiredestruction of the latter, but in achieving this he expect-ed to have heavy losses which he estimated at 8 or 9 oapit-al ships.    His proposal was to give the enemy the equival-ent of what we should lose, and to take the remainder.    SirDavid Beatty said it might be contended that if we contentedourselves with taking all the enemy1s submarines, his HighSea Fleet would soon become obsolete,    There was no reasen,however, to suppose that the enemy would content himself with this situation.    His submarines would be easily replac-ed, and he would soon be in a position to resume submarine warfare,    Se long as his Fleet was in being in the Heligo-land Bight, he could get his submarines to sea.    It was on-ly possible for &quot;us to block his submarines in if we could operate Within a very small radius of the exits of his ports.To enable us to accomplish this we should have always tomaintadn a force superior to him in close proximity of hisbase.    If the enemy retained &amp;capital ships, as at pres-ent, it was out of the question that we could ever maintain an adequate superior force in the Heligoland Bight to sup-port the light forces closing the exits from the enemy1sbases.    Hence, on the principle that there was not to beany fighting after an armistice, we ought to pat it out ofthe enemy1s power to resume the submarine warfare as atpresent.      . ,      -    /: .       t   ff       . v ,.. ^    ,,f..,,, , ^..,.e/   (9) The discussion on&quot; the naval ana malxtary terms ox an armistice was interrupted by the receipt in the morning ofthe Turkish overture for peace, which demanded immediateattention, and in the afternoon of the German reply to president Wilson1s second Note.    In the course of thediscussions/on this subject it was pointed out that the
terras suggested by the Field Marshal for the military con-ditions were on an entirely different plane - from those sug-gested by the Naval Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet.Sir Douglas Haig had based his terms on an appreciation ofthe actual military situation on the Western front, inwhich he stated that Germany was not so badly beaten as toaccept any terms dictated by the Allies.    She naval terms,-on the other hand, were tantamount to unconditional sur-render on the part of the enemy.    If the conditions were such that the enemy would accept the naval conditions, therewas no object in adopting the relatively mo derate conditionsof an armistice proposed by the Field Marshal.In the course of the discussion of the military terms,as has been recorded above in Minute../,., it had been sug-gested that the menace to Germans&apos;&quot; from an attach by the danube through Austria, might perhaps be so serious as tojustify a stiffening of the Field Marshal13 conditions, andthe &quot;Jar Cabinet had invited the Chief of the Imperial Gen-eral Staff to consider this question.It was also suggested that the internal condition ofGermany might be so serious as to justify stiffening the con-ait ions.    In this connection Mr, Balfour said that he hadno special information on the subject that had not been com-munioated to the Allies.    There was no doubt that germany was suffering very severely.    Possibly the distribution offood was now better organised, but there was cumulative evi-aence that they were very short of clothing, boots, and manyraw materials, while their substitutes had, to a great ex-tent, broken down.The Prime Minister pointed out there was always a cer-tain amount of evidence in the other direction, and thatthe evidence was not strong enough to justify basing theterms of an armistice on the assumption that Germany couldnot continue^
She Prime Minister&apos;-, whiTse seating that we were not yet in a position to lay down the terms definitely, said that itwould he important to consider the naval and military con-ditions together when the moment came.    He, therefore, ash-Ij     ed the Board of Admiralty and the Commanddr-in-Chief of the GrantLPleet to examine the question of what would be theminimum naval terms of an armistice which it would be pos-II     sible for us to accept,/      .r ,    h      \fSPiuRASION       flO) With reference to War Cabinet 488, Minute 1, theBRIEF FORICE OOHFERinvitation of the War Cabinet was accepted by General Smutsh*to undertake, on their behalf, the preparation of the Brieffor the the Peace Conference.    General Smuts was authorisedto engage such legal or other assistance as he might findnecessary.GERMAN (II) Early in the afternoon the War Cabinet received theELY SOffSIDENS German reply to President Wilson7 s Second Note as circulatedISON1 SgOHD NOSE.by wireless telegraphy.   (Appendix III). She discussion range-.over a considerable field and no attempt is made to recordmore than the salient points.    Particular attention was drawn to the first paragraph of the German note, which isas follows:-&quot;In accepting the proposal for an evacuation of the occupied territories the German Government has ste-rt-ed from the assumption that the procedure of this ev-acuation and of the conditions of armistice should beleft to the judgment of the military advisers and thatthe actual standard of power on both sides in thefield has to form the basis for arrangements safeguard-ing and guaranteeing this standard.    She German Govern-,ment suggests to the President that an opportunityshoiild be brought about for fixing the details 0WIt was pointed out that the German Government had evi--dently based this paragraph on the assumption that the evao-uation only applied to the allied territory occupied by theenemy, and. not to territory such as Alsace-Lorraine and theSrentino.    She War Cabinet were reminded that, in his First
To assist the Weir Cabinet in the further considerationof this question it was decided:-That the Secretary should circulate the llotes heload taken of the disctissions in Paris on thissubject.
Note, dated October 9, President Wilson had stated:-&quot;Chat he would not feel at liberty to propose a cess-at ion of arras to Governments with which the Govern-ment of the United States was associated against theCentral Powers, so long as the Armies of those Pow-ers are upon their soil.    The good faith of any dis-discussion would manifestly depend upon the consent ofthe Central Powers immediately to withdraw their fore-es everywhere from invaded territoryq&quot;It was recalled that the Allied Conference held in Paris hadimmediately observed the omission of the president definition-it ely to include Alsace-Lorraine in the territory to heeva,cue.ted0    While they had nob definitely drawn the atten-tion of the President to this specific point, they had,  intheir joint telegram of October 9, made the following ob-servation:-&quot;limiting themselves to the most urgent question, thatof the armistice, they think w&amp;t&amp; the President of theUnited States that the preliminary condition of anydisoussion on this question is the evacuation by theenemies of all invaded territories,    But for the con--elusion of the armistice itself they reckon that this condition, while necessary, is not sufficient,&apos;7It was pointed out that even in President Wilson7 second Note the point had not been definitely cleared up.He had stated that:-&quot;It must he clearly understood, that the process of ev-acuation and the conditions of an armistice are mat-ters which must he left to the judgment and advice ofthe military advisers of the United States Govern- &apos;ment and the Allied Governments, and the presidentfeels it his duty to say that no arrangement can beaccepted by the United States Government which doesnot provide absolutely satisfactory safeguards and guarantees of the maintenance of the present militarysupremacy of the Armies of the United States and Al-lies in the fields&quot;The question arose, therefore, as to whether the phrase &quot;She process of an evacuation and the conditions ofan armistice&quot; could fairly be so interpreted as -to enablethe military advisers of the associated &quot;&quot;Governments/to/l;.ninsist upon the evacuation of such districts as Alsace-lor-raine, the TrentinO, Istria, &amp;c.,     Clearly, the GermanGovernment had Interpreted it in the light of the previous
Hotes as applying only to the occupied territories.    from the allied point of view, however, it was absolutely ea-essential that it should be interpreted in the wider sense.It was generally agreed that the present lack of de-finiteness on this point was dangerous, and that from apublic point of view the correspondence might become damag-ing to public opinion in allied countries, and valuablefor the purpose of nerving German morale    Che tendencywas to weaken the Allies for war without paving the way to peace.    It was an intermediate stage between the two.    Itwas generally agreed that it was necessary to clear up thispoint as early as possible.    In this connection, however,it was pointed out&apos; that while it was assumed by the Ger-mans that an undisturbed retreat for the German Army totheir own frontier had already been accepted in principle,and that nothing remained to be done but to work out undermilitary a.dvice the necessary sux^supplementary details, never-theless, there would be no difficulty in including amongthese supplementary details the evacuation of fortressessuch as Heta and Strassburg.It was also pointed out that none of the Hotes contain-ed anything about the naval terms of an armistice, althoughit was suggested that military terms might be interpreted in the wider sense to include naval terms.It was suggested that the German reply on the two re^maining points in president Wilson1 s Second note was alsounsatisfactory-    Theyf excused the devastations perpetratedin their retreat as being always necessary and permitted by international law, and they stated that German troops were under the strictest injunction to spare private property andto exercise care for the population to the best of their ability.    They added that, where transgressions occurredSI.
in spite ofpunished.had ever purposely destroyed lifeboats with their passeng-ers, and suggested neutral commissions to clear up theseehargeso    They stated that they had issued instructions toolaim for justification by international law, nor the prom-ise of punishment, nor the proposed neutral commissions,nor the exemption of passenger ships,while merchant shipsstill remained liable to be sunk at sight, however, could,sions for the adoption of a representative system of govern-ment were, in the main, prospective, and this could not beregarded as satisfactory.On the other hand, it was pointed but that the germans had, in fact, within the last week or two, been less brut-al in their devastations of the country they were evacuat-ing.   Field Marshal Haig said that within the last few daysmany villages had been left undamaged, as well as lilleand some of the larger towns.    Moreover, it was pointed outthat President Wilson*s demands for the reform of the Ger-man constitution were not of a very practical character,insomuch as even in States with a liberal constitution, suchas Great Britain, or the United States of America, therewas no very secure safeguard against a hasty rushing into war.Oil the whole, it was felt that, if satisfactory con-ditions of an armistice could be obtained, these pointswould not in themselves justify the prhlCngajbion of hostil-ities and the l-Oss of-lar-ge--numbers--of British :treops-o -The question was also raised as to whether, in theevent of President Wilson accepting the German proposals,preclude the torpedoing of passenger ships^nSTeither theit was suggested,
Ci U v.!of an armistice, the Allied Governments would stand com-mitted to President Wilson1s Fourteen Points,    it was gen-erally agreed that this was not the ease, and the view was expressed that President Wilson -was not at all likely toagree to the German terms.    It was, however, felt to be ofthe utmost importance that President Wilson should be im-*mediately notified of the general views held by the Brit-&quot;ish Government on the subjects    It was generally felt thatthere would not be much advanta-ge in an immediate conference with the French and Italian Governments until after the ar-rival of Colonel House in Europe.    It was felt advisable,however, to ask the President not to commit himself in re-gard to the nest stage of his negotiations without consult-ation with the Allies.After some considerable discussion, the War Cabinetadopted the draft of a telegram to President Wilson, pre-pared by Mr. Balfour, and decided that:-(i) She secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should at once telegraph to Washington, pointing out that,by concentrating attention on a single sentence in President Wilson1 s first telegram, the Gex-manreply is obviously designed to secure conditionsof an armistice which would be disastrous to thecause of the Allies.    That naval terms were notreferred to at all.    That in the military termsit was assumed that the undisturbed retreat of theGerman Army to its own frontier had already beenaooepted in principle, and that only a few supple-mentar^t details remained to be worked out undermilitary advice.    GJhat the British Government were well aware that this was not the Presidents view.Sheir experts assured them that the result.ofsuch a policy would be that the Germans would getwhat they wanted, namely, time to reorganise, anda short and defensible fronts    She terms desired by the Allies could never be secured by peacenegotiations carried on in such conditions.    If,for example, peace negotiations were broken off by the Germans on such a question as Poland, orAlsace and Lorraine, the Allies would be obliged togive way, or else to recommence hostilities against an enemy refreshed and. re-organised, and so situ-ated that, whatever his opinions, every Germanwould feel that he was fighting for the soil ofhis Fatherland, and not for Pan-German ambitions.
What would inspire his troops would discourageoursj and we might lose all the fruits of victory0It seemed clear that any armistice must includesecurity against the resumption of hostilities&quot;by the enemy, if peace negotiations should breakdown, and probably also against violation of theTreaty of Peace when that was finally concluded.The British Government*s experts considered thatthese ends could oily be attained if the arroisticeprovided:-(a) Chat Allied troops should at once occupysome of the enemy territory, including,at least, AUsace-lorraine:andfb) That adequate precautions should be taken against the resumption of naval warfare,The British Government hoped that PresidentWilson would not commit himself on thesevital questions without first consulting theAllies,Cii) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should communicate the gist of this telegram tothe French and Italian Governments.(IS) The Prime Minister, on behalf of the War Cabinet,escpressed to the Coamander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet,and the Field-Marshal CommandAng-in-Chief, British Ex-peditionary Force in France and Flanders, his thanks fortheir great services.    He pointed out to Admiral Beattythat even our Allies, who had been somewhat slow to real-ise the significance of sea power, had at last begun torealise that the splendid. Fleetg under his Command had provided the essential foundation of victory,    To Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig he said that within the last few weeks he and the magnificent Army under his command had won the most significant victories of the Jar, andif the Germans should sue for peace in the near future,it would be mainly due to these victories of the british army.    He congratulated him on the splendid Army under his command, which now formed the finest fighting forcein the field.i3 CABINET1 SffiflCS TO THEIWDER-IN-HIEE1 OF THEEMIT FLEETND THE FIBLD-PSHAL COM-illDIUG THESITI3H EZPED-flOlfARY FORCEI fBAHCE.\

APPEFSIX II. SECRET.IplMORAj^TOM, BY FIELT) MARSHAL SIR. DOUGLAS HAT.G IN REGARD. TOTHE. MILITARY COKDITIO^ OP Aff.ARMISTICE. .In the event of the enemy asking for an armistice the natureof the reply should depend greatly on the answers which wecan make to the two following questions;1.      Is Germany so beaten that  she will accept any termsdictated by the Allies?2.      Can the Allies continue to press the enemy sufficientlyvigorously during the coining winter months to  causehim to withdraw so quickly that he cannot destroy the: railways,  roads; etc., up to the German frontier?A very large part of the German Army has been badly beat-en, but the whole Field. Army has not yet been broken up.Owing to the large number of Divisions of which it conoistsgeneral disorganisation (which follows a decisive defeat)  isnot yet apparent.In my opinion the German Army is capable of retiringto its own frontiers and holding that line against equal oreven superior forces.The length of that line is about 245 miles as againstthe front of 4-00 miles which he was holding only a week ago.The situation of the Allied Armies is as. follows:The French Army seems greatly worn out,     Many of the rank and file seem to feel that the war has been won.     Lille,Roubaix, Tourcoing and other big centres of industry have been taken.     Reports say that many of their men are   -disinclined, to risk their lives.      Certainly neither on theright nor on the left of the British have the French attackedvigorously during the past six weeks.    Even in July it was theBritish
British and American Divisions which carried the French forward on the Marne,       Next year a large proportion of the FrenchArmies will probably be Black;American Army is disorganised, ill-equipped and ill-trained with very few N.G.O&apos;s and officers of experiences     Ithas suffered severely through ignorance of modern war and itmust take at least a year before it becomes a serious fightingforce.The British Army has fought hard.     It is a veteranforce, very confident in itself but its infantry is already50,000 under strength. If infantry effectives could bemaintained and rest given during the winter it would remain what it is now, the most formidable fighting force in the world.On the other hand with diminishing effectives we must expectmoral to decline.If the French and American Armies were capable of a ser-ious offensive now, the Allies could completely overthrowthe remaining efficient enemy divisions before they could reach the line of the Meuse.They are not. We must reckon with that factas well as with the fact that the British Army alone is not sufficiently fresh or strong to force a decision by itself.This means that the Allies are not In a position toprevent the enemy from doing an immense amount of material damage to railways, roads, etc., during the winter months and during the retirement9The advance of the Allies, when active operations againbegin, will, therefore, be greatly hampered and progress mustbe slow.In the coming winter, too, the enemy will have several months for recuperation, and absorption of the 1920 class,untouched as yet.
So we must conclude that the enemy will he able to hold the line which he selects for defence for some time after the campaign of 1919 commences.To sum up then:-A careful consideration of the military situation on the&quot;western Front,  and keeping British interests in view,  forcesme to the conclusion that an armistice with Germany should be concluded on the following basis:-1.    Complete and immediate evacuation of Belgium and occupied French territories.So    Alsace and Lorraine must also be evacuated and Hetzand Strashurg handed forthwith to the Allies.3.   Rolling-stock of French and Belgian railways or equivalent to be returned, inhabitants repatriated etc.The effect of this would he that the Allied Armies wouldbe established on the enemy1s frontier With their eommuhiea-tions intact and adequate rolling-stock.From such a position a resumption of hostilities wouldenable the war to be prosecuted under favourable conditions onthe enemy&apos;s soil.     Moreover, with Met a, Strasburg, andAlsace-Lorraine in our possession the Allies would be in aposition to invade South Germany.      The military and political advantages of an advance in this direction would be veryconsiderable.(Signed)    L. Haig.

NAVAL TERMS OF AN ARMISTICE.



Copy of letter from Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet to Secretary, War Cabinet.

23rd October, 1918.



My dear Hankey,

I attach notes of the remarks which I made to the War Cabinet at the Meeting on Monday last. As the Meeting was subject to a good many interruptions it was difficult to be consecutive. They contain remarks which were made to the Cabinet as a whole and to Members of the War Cabinet individually which in all probability neither you nor the Prime Minister were aware of. And I consider that the Prime Minister should be acquainted with everything that I said to individual Members so that he should be more thoroughly conversant with what I had in my mind.

The details of the minor Points of the Naval Terms I assume will be discussed later.

There are among them several of great importance. For instance the surrender of Heligoland.

There is one that was not mentioned in the terms at all - i.e. The Baltic Question. It is a question of the great importance from the Naval point of view. Under existing conditions the Baltic is closed to Great Britain and her Allies, a state of affairs which constitutes a serious challenge to our command of the Sca?

It was to exercise our Maritime Rights and keep open the Baltic and its trade that Nelson fought at Copenhagen. You as a student of Naval History will recognise that we cannot tolerate interference with the necessity of upholding the principles for which we have fought in the past, and on the maintenance of which the security of this Country depends.

I hope these notes will be of help to you in compiling the Minutes of the Meeting. I should be very sorry to have to undertake your task. I would have sent them carlior - I made them in the Train on my way North while they were fresh in my mind. Unfortunately my own Secretary who typed them has been hors de combat, with a cold and I did not like to turn them over to anyone else.

I sent a copy to the First Sea Lord who I can safely say is in perfect agreement with them.

Provided the situation will permit I can at any time be at the Service of the Prime Minister when he thinks it desirable to discuss the question again.



Yours sincerely,

The views of the Commander- in-.C-ik.iof. Grand fleet, as oxpressec-at tho War Cabinet Meeting on Monday s 21st October, to the cabinet as a whole, and to individual members of the CabinetL on the&apos;.subject of .&quot;THE NAVAL TERMS OF AH ARMISTICE&quot; -    -1. - I assumed that the object of the   .&apos;ar was: -&quot;The destruction of Gorm-an -Militarism&quot;,..&apos;Prom the Kaval point of view: -- - . . .- &quot;Tho destruction of German Sea Bower&quot;.&apos; . &quot;-.      .    2:- I ashed whether the general circumstances .of ;thewar&apos;from the military point of view made it necessary or desirablethat we should have an Armistice ?    . If.the&apos;.answer was in the . ,affirmative , I recognised that &apos; the - Kaval torms -proposed, would..-. st - certainly prevent it. at this  juncture.-   If, however., theEnemy condition was such as would cause fife m-to accept: the Militaryterms as outlined &quot;by the Field&quot;,Marshal, then ii/was possible thatthey would accePt alsc the Kaval terms.,&apos;-.   .   3.- The Military Successes have been great, ana theMilitary terms are commensurate with their achievements.      TheKavy made them possible and therefore shares in them.....The - Havy . also has wen a - gre at Passive -Victory , has sweptthe. Enemy-. from the - yeas , rendered &quot;secure . the. vast, lines . ofcernifeva i e at 1 ens. with our Allies, and permit ted tke;:, trade of thiscountry-fnecessary for existence, to continue.      Because ours,is a Passive victory.,..it-is no reason why the Empire&quot;should.notreap the fruit s: of &quot;that, victory;.    -        ......     ....    &apos; &apos;..-- &apos; .--. 4.- We have..built&apos; up - a. great Military organization,,but the British nation still exists on Sea &apos;&apos;?.bwer. &apos; . Although aplatitude&quot;, it is one which will&apos; bear constant repetition&apos;,&apos; thatever-, though&apos; we gain many victories on land, one defeat at sea,and the Allies cause is., lost. -- . Inversely we. may be ,.defeated, andcrushed - on land, but if we maintain our supremacy at Sea, theEmpire, will weather the storm.. .  \ &quot; &apos;       \Therefore In framing our Kavai terms, since the-. -existence of the Empire depends on our Sea. Bower, we must ensure thatno. Fleet in being is left which, can threaten our supremacy.    Hocompromise, on this vital point is possible.&apos;.  If there, is to be-elasticity in the terms of theArmistice, it must be On the&quot;Military side and not on the Kaval side.It must pe.. our particular, care to safeguard, the Kavalside .of any Armistice with the enemy.    Our Allies as land po ersmay be exnected to. safeguard the Military side.5.- The question as to ^hat  approximation the Termsof Armistice should have to the Terms of Peace.It was apparently the opinion of the Cabinet thatthe time between arriving at an Armistice and signing the permsof Peace would be long,  even possibly as much as twelve-, months.-It was also
It was.also accepted that after living under conditions of an armistice, for so long, the possibility of returning to war conditions was highly improbable.. .. During the Armistice, and in arranging the Terms of peace,assuming the -best will in the world, friction was bound to arise between the Allies, which would be intensified by theaction of Germany who would devote every effort to sowingdissension...These factors make it very desirable that the terms of theArmistice should be as nearly as possible the Terms of Peace.Therefore the Naval Terms of the Armistice must be stiff and such that will achieve one of the objects for which we are fighting:-&quot;The destruction of German Sea Power&quot;.6.-.   To achieve the destruction of German Sea Power and reduce Germany to the status of a second rate Naval Power, itis necessary to lay down in the Naval Terms of the armistice conditions which would be commensurate with the result of a naval Action, i.e. the result of the Armistice should be what we expect would be the resplt of a Naval Action as regards therelative strength of the two Forces.      The question had beenasked whether,.it would not be sufficient for the Enemy to surrender the whole of their Submarines without humiliating&apos; ;&quot;them to the extent that would be entailed by surrendering theships laid down.in the Naval Terms. I attach more importanceto the surrender of the surface units of the High Sea Fleetthan even to -the whole of the Submarine Fleet.The Power behind the Submarine warfare of the Enemy is theHigh Sea Fleet.    Remove that Power and the Submarine menacewould completely collapse.    The removal of the High Sea Fleetwould allow of the whole of the Forces of the Grand Fleet being set free to tackle the Submarine menace at its source, i.e.the Enemy bases.The Bases could be ringed in by Mine Barriers, obstructionsand nets, which could be guarded by comparatively light Patrols,which could be continuous and of sufficient strength as circumstances required.. The removal therefore of the High Sea Fleet means theremoval of the one Naval, menace - The Submarine. :On the other hand if we. insist on the handing over of enemy Submarines and leave the High Sea Fleet intact, then theposition of affairs, so far as the relative Naval strength isconcerned, is precisely the same as that which obtained at thecommencement of hostilities.During four years of war the enemy has built up a hugeSubmarine Fleet,       In four years of peace he can do all andmore than this,.-and with the High Sea Fleet in being, andassuredly stronger than ever, Germany will again menace the SeaPower of. Great Britain.As a consequence, Sea Power being vital to our existence,excessive expenditure on armament will be entailed at a timewhen the economic effect of such expenditure is likely to be serious.Remove the power of the High Sea Fleet now, and. definitelyreduce the continental nation of Germany to that of a secondrate NavalPower, corresponding to her geographical position and requirements   and our position at sea is at once secured.The threat of the Submarine disappears, and Great Britain inthe future will be spared a race with Germany for Sea supremacy.In stating
