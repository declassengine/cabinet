?AND OF THE ?TERRANEAN ?T.

(l) With reference to War Cabinet 489B. Minute 4, the First Sea Lord said that he Bad received a letter from the British Naval Attaché in Paris, dated October 22, 1918, which stated that the Chief of the French Naval Staff had told him that morning, with reference to the Command of the Allied Naval Forces in the Mediterranean, that M. Clemenceau considered that Vice-Admiral Calthrop should only take charge of such Naval operations which were in direct Liaison with the British military forces. Admiral De Bon had sent a telegram to the French Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean containing the following instructions:-(a) That, in accordance with, the arrangement now in force, Vice-Admiral Annaye should continue to hold control of the Allied Squadron in the Agean if the German and Turkish ships made a sortie from, the Dardanelles:

(b) That Vice-Admiral Calthrop was henceforth in absolute command of the British forces in the Agean, would act as Senior Officer at Mudros, and would control all movements of ships other than those which might be engaged in action with, the German and Turkish ships:

(c)That Vice-Admiral Annaye was to act in close co-operation at all times with Vice-Admiral Calthrop:

(d) That Admiral Gauchet should retain, as Commander-in-Chief, direction of all operations in the Mediterranean, and that he should proceed to the Agean himself if he considered it expedient, retaining the full powers of Commander-in-Chief.

The letter from the British Naval Attaché ended by saying that Admiral De Bon would be glad of the opinion of the First Sea Lord. Admiral Wemyss said that the French Naval




Attach^ in London had already told him that he consideredunthinkable any proposal except that the full Command in the Aegean should be under a British Admiral, and it therefore*  seemed probable that Admiral De Bon was really of the same opinion.    The present situation with regard to the command of the Aegean bad been brought about from the fact that,when it became possible, about four months ago, that these might be a sortie of the Black Sea fleet, there were notin that areas adequate heavy forces to meet it; consequently the French sent six pre-Dreadnought Battleships, under the command of an Admiral senior to the Admiral then commanding in the Aegean, in order to strengthen the Aegean Fleet.This created a difficult position for the British Admiral,but he was given to understand that, as regards movements of heavy ships, he would have to act under the orders ofthe French Admiral, although he still retained command of the Aegean zone.    Since that time, Vice Admiral Calthrophad proceeded to the Aegean, and he was senior to ViceAdmiral Annaye.    Admiral Calthrop did not relieve the Rear-Admiral then commanding the Aegean zone, but was sent there as, owing to events which had then taken place, it was quite impossible for one Admiral to control the necessary operations.The Prime Minister said that the fact that AdmiralAt.Gadchet was authorised to proceed to Mudros if he considered it expedient, amounted to the suggestion that he should do soin order that he might be there if the Turkish emissary went to Mudros, and that, if the Dardanelles were opened, the french admiral could proceed up the Straits in Command of the AlliedSquadron to receive the surrender of Constantinople.    Mr. LloydGeorge said that a telegram had been already sent to AdmiralCalthrop, instructing ^im not to hand over the control of any negotiations with the emissary from Turkey, and that if anyattempt were made to deprive....................
t-i i-; r\(L, &apos;-J vhim of his Command in the Aegean, he was to telegraph for instructions,    Mr Lloyd George read from a letter which hadbeen received by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsfrom the British Ambassador in Paris, pointing out that on thisquestion Me Clemenceau was not very sympathetic, and Lord Derbyin the letter had expressed the hope that the British Governmentwould stand firm and insist on any combined Kaval action againstTurkey being under the Command of a British Admiral.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in reply toa question as to whether any answer had been received with ref-erence to the telegram sent to the French Government informing them of the instructions which had been given to Admiral Gal-throp with regard to the conditions of an armistice with Turkey,said that he had received no answer, but had had an interview with the French Ambassador on the previous day, who had given him to understand that the French Govermuent was somewhat per-disturbed at the terms of the telegram.m.In reply to questions, Admiral Wemyss said that duringthe Dardanelles operations the French Commander-in-Chief had never interfered in the smallest way;    in fact, he had onlyvisited Mudros on one occasion, and that visit was more a visit of courtesy than anything else.   The bulk of the light forces in the Aegean were British, and it would be impossiblefor the French to clear the mines in the Straits without our assistance.   At the present time there were three BritishBattleships in the Aegean, and a fourth would arrive in three days&apos; time.   Although numerically inferior to the French asregards Battleships, the British force was undoubtedly superiorin fighting value.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that liewas informed yesterday that instructions had been issued bythe French Government to the effect that,  if Allied troops
*w   o    -were required to hold both shores    of the Dardanelles, theyshould be employed in proportion to the number of troopsbelonging to the various countries which had taken part inactive operations in the Balkans.    General Wilson said,however, that he had instructed General Milne that the troops to be employed for this purpose were to be in total propor-tion to the troops which had been used in the attack on Turkey.The War Cabinet decided that  The Secretary of State for War, who was proceeding to Prance that afternoon, should beauthorised to inform the French Government thatthe British Government insisted on Vice-AdmiralCalthrop being in Command of the Allied naval forces in the event of any Naval operationstaking place in&apos; the Dardanelles.ICE WITHI (2) With reference to War Cabinet 489B Minute 6, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he desiredto bring to the notice of the War Cabinet a question withreference to the conditions of armistice with Turkey.   WhenBulgaria accepted the terms of an armistice, she could safelydo so, because she knew that at the Peace Conference her territory would be left intact.    Turkey, however, was not inthat position, and undoubtedly an arrangement with regardto an armistice would be come to more quickly if Turkey were assured on two points: firstly, that the Allied powers would leave Turkey an independent monarchy in Asia Minir;and, secondly, that Constantinople would not be taken from her.    If Turkey were asked to give up the Straits and Con-stantinople, she naturally ?/ould want an assurance that allwas not going to be taken from her, and such an assurancewould make a gi-eat difference in any negotiations.It was pointed out that a telegram had been received on the previous night from Sir Horace Kumbold, containing an offer from the Turkish Government to enter into negotiations at Berne, but Mr Balfour said he saw no reason to alter thepresent proposal of the British Government with regard to
wp^-&quot;--......approaching 11y.vk.ej with the conditions of an armistice, andthat in his opinion, Mudros was a more suitable place thanBerne, as any arrangement arrived at at Mudros would signifya military arrangement, while one agreed to at Berne wouldhave a more diplomatic character.General Smuts suggested that, as Admiral Galthrop hadnot been instructed to give any assurances on the points raised by Mr.  Balfour, it might be advisable to use bothchannels, and that an assurance on these two points couldbe given to the Turkish representatives at Berne.The opinion was generally expressed that, with regardto the proposed assurances, neither America nor Italy wouldhave any objections;     but, in ttas view of the claims whichwere put forward by the French Government as to their interests in Constantinople, it was most desirable that thisquestion should be disciissed by the Secretary of State fox*War, with M. Clemenceau during his visit to Prance.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatGeneral Allenby, up to the present, knew nothing about   theinstructions sent to the Vice-Admiral Commanding the Aegeanwith regard to armistice proposals, and that it was not proposed to tell him anything further than that pouparlershad taken place with regard to an armistice, and that therefore it was all the more urgent that he should make asmuch progress as possible, and that it was most important that he should occupy Aleppo, from which he was now 46 miles away, and Mosul, as soon as possible.The War Cabinet decided that  (a)    The Secretary of State for War should he authorised to discuss with the French Governmentthe question as to the assurances which shouldbe given to Turkey on the points raised bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs:(b)    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as ssoon as he had received from the Secretary ofState for War the result of his consultations with the French Government on the points inquestion, should communicate with the american and. Italian Governments:
(c) The Secretary of State for War should send a telegram to General Allenby informing him that conversations with regard to theconditions of an armistice with Turkeymight take place at an early date, and thatit was, consequently, of the greatest importance that he should make all progresspossible and occupy Aleppo as soon aspossible, consistent with military security.(d) That the same principles applied as regardsthe desirability of pressing on towardsMosul.GENERAL (3)   With reference to War Cabinet 489 B, MinuteI0TOSEHD.W 11, the War Cabinet rescinded the decision then taken and decided that  General Towns]end should remain atMudros for the $resent..       .        .2 Whitehall Gardens,    S.W.October 24, 1918.
