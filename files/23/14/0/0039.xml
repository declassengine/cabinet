ITALIAN       (1) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reportedlONT.that the Italian offensive appeared to have been attendedwith but little success.    Some advance had been made onMonte Grappa.    The British had advanced to an island in thePiave, but heavy rain was now falling- and it was understoodthat they had retired to avoid being out off.fUSTICE (2) The Prime Minister drew the attention of his colleage-JlH TURKEY.ues to Lord Derby&apos;s telegram No. transmitting a form-al protest on behalf of the French Government against theaction of the British Government in entrusting the oonclu-sion of an armistice to the British Admiral at Mudros.    ThePrime Minister then read a message he had received from lord Milner from Paris stating that, as regards the Turkishquestion, M. Clemenceau quite agreed that, if the Alliesobtained oomplete and secure control of the Black Sea bythe occupation of the forts on the Bosphorus and Dardanelles,they need not trouble about other conditions.    M. Clemenoeauclaimed, however, that this should be a joint British andFrench occupation.    It was generally agreed that this reply was satisfactory.    The Prime Minister said that we could agree to joint British and French occupation of the fortsand, in his opinion, the Italians ought to be associatedwith us.In view of the satisfactory character of Lord Milner1stelegram it was agreed that:-No immediate action need be taken in regardto the French protest.NAVAL (3) The Prime Minister also read an extract from LordfeaND INJJJE NORTH    MilnerJs telegram to the effect that he and M. ClemenceauPSAN.had not been able to come to an agreement on the questionof the naval command, but that he was to see M. Clemenceauagain in the afternoon and hoped to bring him to see reason.
In the meantime, hac ssOs&amp; idaai M. Olemenoeau had assuredLord Milner that Admiral Gauchet would not he sent to MudrosAdmiral Wemyss reported that he had just received a tele-gram from Admiral Hope to the effect that the matter hadbeen arranged fairly satisfactorilyt and that he was return-ing to London,,ISTICB (4) The War Cabinet discussed at some length the questionE GERMANY,as to with whom the initiative lay for taking the next stepitary con-feons of   in the negotiations in regard to an armistice with Germany,[armistice.President Wilson1 s last Note was carefully examined fromthis point of view, but it was not found possible to deduceexactly with whom the next action lay.    It might be Ext thatthe next step was for the Allies to move their Generals to formulate the terms of an armistice,,    It might be that be-fore doing so they should await the formal communication and.relevant documents from President Y/ilson.   Or it might bethat they should wait for Germany to make a formal demandfor the conditions of an armistice.    It was generally agreedthat -These matters could only be cleared up by consultationwith Colonel House in Paris, and that, in the meantimein order that there might be no delay9 the Generalsshould consider the terms of an armistice, as proposedby M. Clemenoeau.(5) The Prime Minister read a telegram that had just been received from Lord Derby, No. 131S, to the effectthat Mo Clemenoeau was much annoyed at the latest move of president Wilson without consultation with the Allies; thatM. Clemenoeau had sent for Marshal Eooh and General Eetainand arranged for a conference to be held tomorrow between these Generals as well as Pie Id Marshal Haig and general pershing, in order to draw up terms for an armistice to beconsidered by the Erench Government.   M. Clemenceau had
(L -x uinstructed the GeneralsFirst, that every possible safeguard should he consider-ed and guarantee demanded in order to ensure the safety of the allied armies during the time of thearmisticetandSecon&amp;,that such steps should he taken that the german army, in the event of a renewal of hostilities,would not he in a tetter position than at thepresent moment.M. clemenceau had also communicated with Signor Orlando inregard to General Diaz drawing up terms.This telegram was discussed at some length, and it was generally agreed that the general instructions given by M*clemencoau  as the basis for the discussion by the Generalswere not adequate.    It was pointed out that the Supreme WarCouncil would probably be called to consider the questionearly next week, when they would have before them the reportof the Generals.    If this report was prepared on a wrongbasis a very unsatisfactory state of affairs would be reach-ed.    It was pointed out that M. Clemenceau1s general in-structions were not only much less drastic than the basis which had been agreed on at the recent Conference at Parisfor the examination of this question by the Military repres-representatives, but also that they were much weaker than the suggestions made by the British Government to PresidentWilson, which had formed the basis of the relevant portions of his last two Notes to Germany.    (F*0. Telegram Uo065 to Washington).    It was also pointed out that the FrenchGovernment had stated that they considered it necessary to add further conditions to those mentioned in the telegramjust quoted.    (F.0*Telegram Ho. 1899 from Paris).Attention was also drawn to telegram No.1314 from Parisin which lord Derby stated that M. Clemenceau assumed that
the Admiralty would be represented at the Supreme War.Council to consider the conditions of an armistice.    Itwas generally agreed that the meetings of the Supreme WarCouncil should be preceded by a meeting at Paris of theAllied Naval Council.The War Cabinet approved the following actions-(i) The Prime Minister should prepare a telegram from himself to M. Clemenceau to the effect that theBritish Government considered M. Clemeneeau1s in-structions to Marshal Pooh, and the Allied Generalsassociated with him, inadequate to fulfil the agree-ment reached at Paris as the basis of examination bythe Military representatives; and that he would pre-fer that the general instructions should be basedjftfrj: upon President Wilson1 s declaration in regard to an armistice as contained in his last Notes(ii) That the Secretary&apos;of State for Foreign Affairs shouldtransmit this message to lord Derby, instructing him to communicate it immediately to M. Clemenceauand to give copies to Colonel House, lord Milner,and Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, ashing the lat-ter to communicate it to Marshal Foch and GeneralPetaintfiii) That the Prime Minister should send a message,throughthe Foreign Office, to M. Clemenceau suggesting thata meeting of the Supreme War Council should be sum-moned for Tuesday next at Versailles9 asking M. Clem-enceau to invite Colonel House to attend.   M. Glem-enceau also to be informed that the meeting of theSupreme War Council should, in his view, be preceded by a meeting of Admirals, in order that their advicemight be before the Council on Tuesday, and that theAdmiralty were making the necessary arrangements with the French and Italian Naval authoritiesj(it)   The Prime Minister should also send a message to signor Orlando suggesting a meeting of the supreme war Council next Tuesdays(v)    That the Admiralty should arrange for an immediatemeeting of the Allied Naval Council in Paris.ERMSo    (6) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointednt     out one result which would follow from the acceptance ofsthe proposal in President Wilson1s latest Note that theAllies should enter into an armistice.   However drastic1   and stringent might be the terms of the armistice, it would    be impossible, in imposing terms of peace, to go beyond the
the Fourteen Points laid down by President Wilson.    TheGermans would be entitled to say that they had been praot-ically disarmed and made impotent for further warfare on condition that peaoe was made on the basis of the Fourteenpoints.    He then read the draft of a telegram to Washing-ton and to our Allies, which he had prepared to provide against this contingency.The Prime Minister agreed with Mr. Balfour.    Supposingthe Allies entered the Conference, and the Germans claimedFreedom of the Seas, we should have no answer unless we had made a definite statement before we entered into an armist-ice that we did not accept this condition.   His suggestion was that, at the Versailles Conference, the representativesof the British Government should state that the doctrine of the Freedom of the Seas only bound President Wilson andnot the British Government, and, further, that there were several conditions not included in the Fourteen Points whichwould have to be added.    He thought that the British Govern-ment ought to make up their minds at once on these points.Otherwise the Germans would have a perfect right to assume that the Fourteen Points were the worst conditions that could be imposed on them*Mr0 Balfour said that Sir William Wiseman thought thatwe could agree to some formula which President Wilson wouldbe prepared to call Freedom of the Seas.The Prime Minister said it would not be fair to the Ger-mans, who naturally assumed the definition of &quot;Freedom of these as&quot; to be that employed by Colonel House in 1915,&quot;when hehad visited Berlin.    No doubt they had a full record ofwhat Colonel House had then said.There was considerable discussion as to whether the best course would be to send an immediate telegram on the subjectto President Wilson and our Allies, or to await the meeting
of the Supreme War Council and circulate a document on thesubject before the meeting, possibly after consultationwith Colonel House.    On the whole the former course was pre-ferred, and the War Cabinet decided that:-The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouldr   send a telegram to Washington and to our principalT       H fW ti) Allies explaining the connection between the armist-i   .        ice and the terms of peace, and that the BritishUhv&quot; -  Government could not accept the doctrine of FreedomyAv./. .. c rx,.t of the Seas, and considered it necessary to add oer-. i .. tain conditions to the Fourteen Points laid down byLAW President Wilson.EEY. (7) Lord Curzon raised the question as to whether themmms of       recent decision of the War Cabinet was a wise one, namely,Armistice.that the Admiral at Mudros, if unable to obtain the wholeof the terms of an armistice with Turkey drawn up in Paris,should be authorised to agree on the first four points,which covered the opening of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus,secure access to the Black Sea, and the question of prison-ers.   He pointed out that the bulk of the fighting againstTurkey had been undertaken by the Indian forces.    It was not altogether without difficulty that these had been arranged for.    India, however, looked to complete victory as the re-suit of this fighting.   He reminded the War Cabinet also of our obligations to King Hussein.    The establishment of continuing peace in the East depended largely on our ability to carry out this undertaking.    If, however, the Turks ac-cepted the reduced terms of an armistice, would would be themilitary position?   Ste xhEO&amp;ix EECfe tog Our troops probablywould not be at Mosul or Alexandretta, and perhaps not atAleppo.    The Turks would still be at Batoum, Baku, and in north-West Persia.    The conclusion of an armistice wouldmean that operations would cease.    When we demanded theTurks should retire from Syria, from Mesopotamia, and fromthe Caucasus there would be months of bargaining.    The
Turks would dispute every point.    They would allege thatAlexandretta was not in Syria, and make difficulties ofthis kind at every point.    They would he effusive in theirprotestations of friendship on the conclusion of the armist-ice agreement, &quot;but they would laugh at us behind our backs.When the question had last been raised, he had felt, at themoment, that it was so much a military question that it wouldbe almost impertinent on his part to intervene.    On thinkingthe matter over, however, he very much doubted whether thedecision ought not to be reversed.    One minor point he wish-ed to mention was in regard to Lahej , which was a BritishProtectorate close to Aden, at present occupied by the Turks.This also, he thought, ought to be evacuated.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that whenhe had recommended the course that had been adopted, hehad been thinking of the next military move, which would be against Austria.    His great objeot had been to secure the immense military   advantage of opening the Dardanelles9with a view to a line of communications up the Danube.The Prime Minister said that, from a purely Turkish orEastern review of the position, he was in agreement with lord Curzon.    He reminded him, however, that at the timethe War Cabinet had felt that if the Black Sea were openedit would give an enormous inducement to Germany to accept an armistice on severe terms.   A further point was thatit would be very difficult for us, after the French had agreed in the proposed new terms of the armistice, for usto say that we had changed our minds.Mr. Chamberlain said that he himself had not felt quitehappy about the decision in regard to Aden, and other pointsincluded in the original conditions of an armistice drawn
24 5.up In Paris, but omitted from the first four.    He felt,however, that it would be a very difficult thing to send atelegram to the Admiral altering his instructions.Mr. Bonar law agreed with Mr. Chamberlain.General Wilson also agreed from a military point ofview.The subject was adjourned for consideration on the following day.$RATIONS (8) The Prime Minister said that a difficulty had arisenFLANDERS.in regard to the continuance of General PlumerTs Army underIlndI? and thethe command of the Zing of the Belgians,   Marshal Foch hadgian Gom-4. put the Ilnd Army under the general command of the King ofthe Belgians for particular operations.    These operationshad now been completed, and Field Marshal Haig wished tohave General Plumer*s Army back under his command.    marshal foch, however, declined to agree.    His view was that whenthe Allies entered Brussels, King Albert should march in atthe head of a mixed force.   An unsatisfactory feature of thesituation was that the French had sent some divisions up to cooperate with the Belgians.    They had, however, been mis--i   t  f     &quot;erable attenuated divisions which had taken no part in thefighting.    The British troops had fought magnificently, ashad the Belgians, but the French had only apparently beensent up to take a nominal part and the real object was that,in any entry to Brussels, they should be there to give theimpression that the French had taken an equal share inthese operations.   As a matter of fact, ita as the Prime MLn-ister explained on a map, the British must take the princi-pal part in any advance on Brussels, and, in these circum-stances, it seemed only fair that Field Marshal Haig shouldtake the command.    The Field Marshal could be trusted,in theevent of a formal entry into Brussels, to make a beau jeste,and to permit King Albert to march in at the head of an
0 ACAllied Army.    Up to the present Field Marshal Haig had not formally asked, for the intervention of the British Govern-ment under the Beauvais Agreement, hut, as General Wilsonwas proceeding to France tomorrow the question arose as towhat line he and Lord Milner should take up on the subjectoGeneral Wilson explained that Marshal Foch apparently haddetached General Plumer&quot;s forces for an indefinite timeoField Marshal Haig contended that he was being called onto carry out very formidable operations elsewhere, and he wanted to have a call on General piumer^ Army, which form-ed a considerable proportion of the British foroe.    Further,he contended that, as the fighting must be done mainly byBritish troops, they ought to be under his commandoShe War Cabinet authorised:-The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to informField Marshal Sir Douglas Haig that, if   MarshalFooh would not agree, he should appeal to theBritish Government under the Beauvais AgreementsDBSIR- (9) The War Cabinet had a short preliminary discussionIIIY OFffiMEST-   on a question raised by the Prime Minister as to whether itwas really desirable to have an armistice at the present tiffa.or not.    He himself had an open mind on the question.    Theissue really was as to whether we should grant what mightbe termed a good peace now, or whether we should impose suchdrastic terms for an armistice now that the enemy could not accept,our intention being utterly to crush him next year,with the Idea of obtaining better security for peace for thethe future.The War Cabinet agreed:-To meet on the following day to consider thisquestion, together with the following questions?&quot;The Naval Conditions of an Armistice:The Question raised by Lord Curzon as to the reconsideration of the Conditions of an armistice with Turkey.Whitehall Gardens, S.W. _-Oct. 26, 1918.
