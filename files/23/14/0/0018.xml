Ocs 1DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held in the Secretary of Statefor War&apos; s Room, WAR OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.?fM or. SATURDAY,MAY 11^  1918, at 11 &amp;.m.XA, (1) The Prime Minister,  referring to the Memorandum byBaltic       the Admiralty,  dated May 9, 1918 (See War Cabinet 408 A..MasMlS.) * with reference to the proposals fox- the destruo-tion of the Russian&apos; Baitio Fleet, said that these proposalsnecessitated an important decision on the part of the WarCabinet as to future policy in Russia.    The question whichhad to be decided was whether there vrss hope of any material assistance from Russia in the future, or whether anything.wasto be gained by not driving Russia into the arms of Germany.If the destruction of the Fleet were carried out, it must inevitably be found out who had done it, or, at any rate,; itwould be said that it had been done at the instigation ofthe British Government.The First Sea Lord agreed that this action we-u-la......pro-b&amp;h-l-y antagonise Russia and set M, Trot ski against us.Thg Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thathe regarded with dismay the prospect of driving Russia intothe srraa of Germany,   While we were all talking, Germany wasacting.    She had already possession of the Crimea and partof the Black Sea Fleet;    she had got Finland, and was threat-ening Murro&amp;nsk;    she had not only possession of the whole ofthe, Ukraine but was extending the limits of the Ukraine to suit her own purposes.    Further than that, Germany was getting
o n0complete control over what was le.Ct of Russian Industry and finance.    Mr Half our expressed the opinion that, if theRussian people were at any time prepared to resist, their position would become Impossible if, by any action of theAllies, they were thrown into the hands of Germany.   Thequestion he would put was, whether the blowing up of theBaltic Fleet would have  this effect, and he was of opinionthat it certainly would,  if M.Trotaki wanted to quarrel with us  - at any rate, there was some danger of it happening.The Secretary of State for v7ar said that it appearedto him that the question was whether the Russians preferredthe Germans to us;    if they did not, he did not see why theyshould object to the destruction of the Fleet.Mr Balfour said that it was impossible to define thesituation in this way.    He drew attention to telegram No,165,from Mr lockhart, in which Iks lockhart said that the late in     Kerensky&apos; s Government,Minister for Trade/-, in conversation with him, had 3aid that nothing could now save Russia except foreign help;    thatthere were a large number of classes in Russia who hatedthe Bolsheviks and looked to foreign intervention;    but thathe would be the first to range himself against Japanese in-ter vent ion.   Mr Balfour said that this proposal to blow upthe Baltic Fleet raised much larger issues * and it was hisopinion that these issues must be discussed..Lord Curzon enquired what had taken plaoe with LLTrot-aki with reference to the Baltic Fleet.    He had understoodthat it was arranged that the Russians should blow up thisFleet.   Would it not be possible, he asked,  to say to M.Trot-zki that he had done nothing in this matter, -and that, asthe danger of wlich we had warned him in connection with the black Sea Fleet had occurred and that  it was now in german hands, it was essential that we should take action in regardto the Baltic Fleet?Ma^or-KJeneral Pools aaid that if the result of blowingup the Russian Fleet was a definite break with Russia, he was strongly opposed to it, and expressed the opinion that more
good could be done by working in Russia,    He gathered thatthe proposal would entail some loss of life, and that if it did it must have a bad effect.The First. Lord said that, while it was impossible tosay that no loss of life would occur,  the destruction of theFleet might be accomplished without it,  and that every step would be taken to avoid such loSa of life.General Smuts said that it was most important not toantagonise the Russians.    He was strongly of opinion thatthe Russian Government should be consulted;    for, to&apos;performwhat was undoubtedly an act of war before consultation withthe  Russian Government, would be,  in his opinion, mostreprehensible, and after such an act we must be prepared forany consequences.    He pointed out that in the Baltic theRussian Fleet consisted of 5 Dreadnoughts, 9 Cruisers. 70Destroyers and 26 Submarines, which Fleet,  in the hands ofthe enemy, would be a wry serious matter.    It was essential,therefore, that measures should be taken to destroy the Fleetif danger became imminent, and he was of opinion that weshould urge K.Trotski to take the necessary measures.    his view was that the  Russians should be urged to do this, butthat at the same time the Admiralty should continue to per-fect its machinery to carry out the proposal ,  if necessary.Sir Eric Geddes suggested that the Naval Attache at petrograd should receive instructions to make all the necessary -sary arrangerents, but not to act until ordered.    He express-ed the opinion that it was vital that these ships should bedisabled, more particularly with regard to the Destroyers,as our Grand Fleet was somewhat short of these vessels, andthat if the 70 Destroyers which were in the Baltic were addedto the High Sea Fleet a very serious situation would arise.^At this point the War Cabinet adjourned,jn order to view the m^irch-past of the.Aj^rijianm.l 0^iT)
Th* Prime Minister said that he would like to put aquestion to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and toask him&apos;whether * in the event of the Germans falling in thenext attack on the Western Front, it would be. possible totransfer some of the Allied troops to help M.Trotzki, inorder not only to prevent more German troops being moved from the Russian Front, but possibly, and even probably,to make the Germans transfer  some Divisions from ?!fest to east.    He asked whether it would not be possible for theAllied Government9 to say to M. Trotzki that, If he was pre-pared to offer resistance, the French and British governments would give hiia a certain number of troops, and that he could also have the use of the 70,000 Czech-Slovak troops now inRussia, and- Siberia,   In that event it would be very diffi-cult for the Japanese to refuse to Join the Allied Forces inRussia.   With regard to the landing of any Allied troops, hesaid that General Poole had suggested that the best place would be Archangels so the situation at Murmansk was not clear and the oondltion of the railway from there In suraner-t the -^$s always very bad.    It was impossible to treat the latesttelegrams from Mr Loekhart, with regard to M,Trotzkir8 atti-tude, as of no account,    There was no doubt that up to acertain point Vi.Trotski; had played into German hands, butthat his view had considerably changed, and that it. could beassumed that it did not suit M.Trotzki now to be under german domination.   He.therefore would like to kno^ whether someaoti on sueh a a ha proposed was not possible,, and suggestedthat some American troops might be diverted and landed at vladivostock, pointing out that it would not be necessary tomake use. of highly-trained troops, but that it was very deslr^Sbblis that a nucleus of Allied troops should be sent to Russiaso that U. Trotzki might feel that he had some force behindhim.
o cO JIn reply to Lord liilner, who said that he consideredimmediate action was necessary and that time was all-import-ant,  the Prime Minister said that he was not so sure of this,in view of the reports, which undoubtedly showed how theGermans were using brutal methods in Russia, particularlyin the Ukraine, which methods were causing a fierce anti-German feeling to arise.    He did not suggest that therewould be long delay, as he assumed that in the next fortnightor three weeks it would be definitely known as to whetherthe German onslaught in Prance had been stopped.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that,before answering this question, he would like to have sometime for consideration.    At any rate, it would not be possi-ble to divert any troops at present, and probably it wouldnot be known for some time   at any rate for s4rX- weeks  a3 to who was to be the master in the Western theatre ofoper at ions.General Poole suggested that if even 5,000 troops could be sent now, it would make a start.   These troops could be sent to Archangel and Vologda, and,  if attacked atthe latter place,  the bridge at Vologda could be blown up,and they oo\ild remain at Archangel until further reinforce-ment3 were sent.   The presence of 5,000 Allied troops would ensure the accumulation of 100,000 Russian troops behind them.*Lv balfour said that,  in connection with this proposal,he felt bound to dra^ attention to the arrangements whichwere being made by the French to transport the 50,000 Czech-Slovaks referred to in &apos;.?ar Cabinet 405, Minute 8(i) fromVladivostock to Prance.    Yesterday he had had an interview with the three representatives of the Czech-Slovaks in London,and lie had pointed out to them what seemed to him the impos-sibllity of sufficient transport being procurable to sendthese troops to France, and had asked whether they would notbe prepared to fight in Russia. He had understood the answer to be that the Czechs were afraid that they would only beused in Russia as gendarmes;    that they were very anxious
to fight the Germans;    and that if they were to be used astroops under British and French officers they would not ob-,)ect.    Mr Balfour pointed out that these troops would be in-valuable in Russia, particularly as they were Slavs.Mr Chamberlain called attention to the last reportfrom the Allied Maritime Council, i^hich Showed so serious a deficiency in tonnage that it called for review of all Armysupplies and imports.The opinion whs generally expressed that there was no possibility, at any rate at the present, of transport being available to ship the Czech Divisions to France.The question arose as to what M.Trotzki&apos;3 attitude would be if lie were informed that some 50,000 Czech troops and some 20,000 American^ British and French troop3,  fully equipped, were ready,to support him.    In this connectionMr Balfour called attention to telegram Wo.3871, which hehad sent to Lord Reading, with reference to the gradual but most Important change in M.Trotzki&apos;s attitude as reported byMr Lockhart.    In this telegram lie had pointed out that M.Trotzki&apos;s present embarrassment arose from his belief,  onlytoo well-founded, that,while the Germans were in a positionto attack them at once, the Allies, even if invited, wouldnot for a long time be ready to come to his assistance.The Prime Minister was of opinion that M.Trotzkicould go no further than he had done. It was obvious that M.Trotzki could, not trust M,Lenin, who was a disciple ofTolstoi, and that if he were to make open overtures to theAllies the Germans would know of this at once.    Mr LloydGeorge suggested that a Conference should be held to consid-er the best methods of organising some means for assistanceto K.Trotzki.    He also suggested that it would be advisable that a Mission should be sent to Russia, the importance ofwhich M.Trotzki must recognise,  in order that some definite policy might be agreed upon.    It was obvious that the Allied
Governments must be prepared to act without waiting for an invitation from M. Trot ski.Lord Curzon expressed the opinion that this conference should also enquire into the question of the proposed destruc-tion of the Baltic- Fleet,  and said that he was afraid that,while we were discussing plans, the Fleet would be taken overby the Ge moans *Sir Eric Geddes said that, in his opinion, the way todeal with the question of the Fleet was to instruct the naval attache at Petrograd to continue his preparations.    If some-one could then go to M,Trotzki, he could bs made to understandthat we intended to destroy the Fleet with or without hisacquiescence, rather than run the risk of letting the Fleetfall into German hands, as had happened to the Black Sea Fleet.Mr Balfour suggested that he should telegraph to MrLookhart pointing out what had happened in the case of the black Sea Fleet, and saying that, as it was vital that theGermans should not obtain possession of the Baltic Fleet,and as M,Trotzki had acquiesced in the principle of its des-t-ruction, we considered that we were entitled to destroy it.He proposed to ask him,  if he hid any objection, to wire atonce, but not to speak to M.Trotzki on the question.   Mr Bal-four pointed out that if he sent such a telegram it wouldgive Sv-r Lockhart &amp;n opening to say either that he consideredwe were going to do something with which he could not possiblyagree, or that he was of opinion that the Russians would notview our action so seriously as to antagonise there.Mr Chamberlain pointed out that the telegram receivedfrom the Naval Attache said that some ships were ready fordestruction, and that if this meant the means of destructionwere already on board,  it would be very dangerous to send sucha telegram, which night lead to an examination of the ships.Sir Eric Geddes said that, to his mind,  this pointed to the necessity of someone who knew the mind of the Cabinetseeing M.Trotzki, but that in the meantime preparations should
o cbe continued for the destruction of the Fleet.    All thatCaptain Cromie, the Ma^al Attache&apos; at Petrograd, wanted wasauthority to spend money in order to complete his arrange-aient s . -   IIt was pointed out that the Germans were now only150 kilometres, or three or four days&apos; march, froa Petrograd,1and that it -would be necessary for Captain Cromie to take immediate action if they advanced any further.The &apos;-7ar Cabinet decided that : -(a) The Secretary of State for War shouldconvene a Conference, consisting of:-.General Smuts, the First Sea Lord, theChief of the Imperial General Staff,and himself, to consider the best methodof organising some weans of assistance for Ivl.Trptzki, and to put a definite pro-posal on this question before the WarCabinet:(b) The First Lord of the Admiralty should instruct the Naval Attache&apos; at Petrogradto continue his preparations for the des-truction of the Baltic Fleet;    and that,if he had reason to believe that the Ges4-mans were advancing on Petrograd andthat the Russian Fleet was in imminent---7 danger, he was to take act ion *\ Captain Cromie was also to be informedm yuAi^r- ^ that he was authorised to initiate anywT (4,**^*-*   j expenditure to carry out the above, butI; 1      A* care should be taken not to alienaterT    1 * \-**   i unnecessarily the Russian Government,WKL SITUATION   (2) The First Sea Lord read a Note upon the Naval Situa-;IN THE MEDITER- .RAN RAN, ADRI- tlon in the Mediterranean, Adriatic and Aegean (Appendix) ,ATIC AND AEGEAN.Sir Eric Geddes said that he had drawn this up afterconsultation with the Italian Ambassador and Lord Milner.He pointed out that the Italians ted accepted in principle the transfer of the four Italian Battleships to Corfu, but^hat the Question of Command had been raised.    In this oon-fieotion he drew attention to a telegram from ftuCleiaenceauto the Prime Minister, dated the 10th Instant, which pointedout that on this subject there was a certain weakening onthe part of Signer Orlando with reference to the transfer ofthe Dreadnoughts to Corfu.    Sir Eric Geddee believed that
o nM.Ciernence.au was quite aware that the real difficulty wasthe unwillingness of the Italians to come under french naval Command.    Pic- laid before the War Cabinet a draft telegram, to be sent from the Prime Minister to M,Clemen-oeau, which ran as follows:7-&quot;Your wire of 10th regarding ItalianDreadnoughts going to Corfu. italian ambassador has approached us on subjectof Italians taking Command of Frenchand Italian Forces at Corfu when theysend their Dreadnoughts there.

APPENDIX



NOTE UPON NAVAL SITUATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, ADRIATIC, and AEGEAN.



The acquisition by the Germans of the Russian Black Sea Fleet brings about a new and dangerous situation in the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Adriatic. It is essential not to allow questions of National amour propre to bring about a Naval disaster. 

To-day the French and Italian Battle Fleets at the mouth of and outside the Adriatic,,  taken together are, theoretically, far more than a match for the Austrians, but not so separately, and there is little or no satisfactory arrangement  for the two Fleets immediately combining. The position is considered to-day to be far from satisfactory. The new situation created by the German acquisition of the Russian Black Sea Fleet is most serious and menacing.     There is ample Allied strength to meet and beat both the Black See Fleet and the Austrian Fleet if the Allied Forces are properly grouped and commanded in such a way as to ensure effective co-operation, strategic dispositions, and tactical efficiency. It was proposed that 6 French Battleships should go to reinforce the Aegean, and 4 Italian Battleships should go to Corfu for incorporation with the French Forces there. It is admitted by all the Naval experts on the Allied Council that this is in principle quite sound, but the Italian Representatives reserved their acceptance of the proposal. The French and Italian Forces in this theatre of war compare as follows:-


Preach - fourteen ships fit to lie in lino,Italians - nine ships..The French command all this Naval Forces in theSea of manoeuvre   , namely, tha U*ditarran^an outside tkoAdriatic.    The Command in that Sea must be one, and Corfu isthe main base.To give the best results the Its.li.ans_ must oono-entx^taat Corfu, with the French&apos;.    The amour propre which preventsthe Italians from desiring to come under the command of theFrench would equally and more strongly prevent the French fromcowing under the Italian command, and having regard to theirlarger Forces in the theatre of war concerned, and to thefact that the French Admiral is now Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, this is the more understandable.As a way out of the difficulty, and as an improvementalso on the present proposal, it was suggested that anAdmiralissimo should be appointed commanding generally allthe Allied Haval Forces east of Gibraltar,  the Admiralissimoto servo under the Allied Haval Council and to be bound asregards the general disposition of the Haval Forces underhim by the decisions of the Allied Naval Council approved bythe Supreme T7ar Council.Thus Naval Forces, whether Italian&apos;or Allied,allotted to the Adriatic by the Naval Council could remain under direct Italian Command, and Forces elsewhere in theMediterranean or Aegean under other Allied Commands.    It wassuggested that under this arrangement it would perhaps be unnecessary, strategically, for Italian battleships to leaveTarranto, as they would all be under one Admiralissimo, andtheir co-operation and co-ordination with the Corfu forces would thus be secured.
pJf orWhile the British do not ash/or desire to press for thio Command, and are content to continue as to-day with the French in command generally in tho Mediterranean,provided the transfer of Italian battleships to Corfu andof French battleships to the Aegean is carried out, theywould be prepared, if it would ease matters and be acceptable to tho Allies, to suggest the name of a british admiral for approval of the Supreme War Council as Intar-Allied Admiralissirao in general oomraand cl all Alliedllaval Forces in the Mediterranean1, Adriatic and Aegean.
