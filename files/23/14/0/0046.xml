ERMAN, (3) The First Lord read out a telegram (Appendix I) which hadI.emanated from the German Warship STRASBURG summoning the german fleet to repair to certain stations and&quot; be prepared to defend the Fatherland against the British.    The message also called fora general concentration of German submarines at a northern port.The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff pointed out that theSTHASBURG was the ship which had remained loyal longest.(3) The First Lord read a message he had received from theFirst Sea Lord in France (Appendix II). saying that nothing was known beyond what had appeared in the Press of the present condi-tion of the German Fleet;    that the German Ars^ *as showing-a-
increasing signs of demoralisation, and that the term of thearmistice which oaussd the greatest consternation among theGerman delegates was that relating to the continuation of the bloc hade.[THE DARDAN- (4) The First Lord read a telegram. (Appendix III) which hehad received from Admiral Galthorpe, British High commissioner at Constantinople, stating that the channel had been cleared of mines as far as Ghanah, and that we had landed forces on Galli-poli Peninsula, which were proceeding to occupy&apos;the forts.:p, AUSTRIAN (5) The First Lord read a message which he had received fromIlLBET .our Naval Attache&apos; in Austria. (Appendix IV), describing the con-ditions of the Austrian Fleet as chaotic; the men were even being allowed to loot the ships&apos; stores in order to induce ttnm to goashore.MiOBILISA-    (8) The War Cabinet decided  -HON.(a) Army. That the demobilisation of the Army shouldbe proceeded with, to the following extent(i) Miners to be released as rapidly as theycould be re-absorbed into their own em-ploy saent :(ii) Pivotal men to be withdrawn sinultane-ously with the miners.(b) Navy. The War Cabinet decided     iThat nothing should be done towards demobil-&apos;ising the Navy for the present, and that even pivotal men should not be released untilthe German Fleet was either banded over ordefinitely under authoritative control.IUffilTAHT (7) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff-said that the war BERLIN.Office har&apos; sent out Military Attaches to Sofia, Vienna and Con-stantinople immediately on the cessation of hostilities with bulgaria, Austria and Turkey.    He asked the approval of the .WarCabinet to a Military Attache&quot; being at once despatched to Berlin,as it was very necessary indeed that we should have somebody onthe spot to -furnish us with inside information of what was hap-pening in Germany,if The War Cabinet decided  
To approve the appointment of a military attache at Berlin,[ijHAKKSGIV-   (8) The Prime Minister said that he h$.d just been informedIflG SERVICE. tothat His Majesty The King proposed^attend a Thanksgiving service to he held at St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral at 12.-15 on the following day.It was not a State Service, and so the attendance of Ministerswas not commanded, jThe War Cabinet decided  That His Majesty&apos;a Ministers should attend the Thanksgiving Service in morning dress.[$VISIONlOD TOWhtriesOP (9) The Prime Minister said that all our information went toshow that the food situation in enemy countries was considerablyworse than we had imagined.    Those nations had made an abjectsubmission, and enemy peoples were in a very bad way.    It behoved.us now to behave as a great nation and to do nothing which mightarouse and harbour a spirit of revenge later.    The future peace of the world would, depend more on the way in which we behavedafter victory than upon the victory itself.    He suggested, there-fore, that, if his colleagues agreed with him, they should pro-ceed to consider at once what steps it might be possible to take to get food to enemy countries.The War Cabinet fully concurred in the Prime Minister&apos;view, and decided  To resume the discussion when the Pood Con-troller, the Minister of Shipping and theMinister of Blockade could attend.(The discussion was resumed shortly afterwards, when Sir Joseph Maclayand. Sir.....John Peale were tare sent.)The Prime Minister explained that the War Cabinet had decided that immediate steps would be taken to consider to what extent and in what manner food might be furnished to starvingenemy peoples.   He said that he himself could not understand whyGermany should be short of bread, as she had only lately gatheredin her harvest, and there should&apos;-be sufficient stocks to draw &apos;upon to last her until the Spring.    In view of the above decision,
the War Cabinet desired that the Minister of Shipping, the PoodController and the Minister of Blockade should oonsxxlt togetherat once and report at the earliest possible moment to the WarCabinet.Sir John Bealesaaid that the reason why the recent har-vests could not be drawn upon to the fullest extent by the Ger-mans was the lack of threshing machines and the breakdown oftransport.    Experience had shown how much easier it was to die-tribute food by landing it at ports than by collecting it inthe country districts.    He said that it would be necessary forthe Pood Controller and the Minister of Shipping to consult theFrench, American and Italian representatives who were now inLondon, before reporting to the War Cabinet.   He assumed thatthe first essential foodstuff they had to provide was bread.There would be less difficulty, he thought, about supplyingwheat than meat and fats.    The most serious shortage of foodsttffffstoday in the whole world was fats.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to atelegram which had been sent from the Foreign Office the previousSaturday night to our representatives at Paris, Washington and rome (Appendix 5), pointing out the urgent importance of bringing into service at the earliest possible moment the Austro-Hungarianships in Adriatic ports and neutral ports elsewhere, and suggest-ing action to this end.    The telegram also stated that the associated Governments were prepared to consider giving emergencyassistance in provision of food supplies,which would be arranged by the Inter-Allied Food Council in London. - Mr Balfour said thatthe Germans were particularly pressing for the release of Uorwe-belgian herrings.    He also pointed out that it was not only our lateenemies who were threatened with famine, as the food situationin many neuteal countries was very serious.   The situation in holland was particularly grave.    On political as well as humanitarian-tarian grounds he thought it desirable to release food everywhere,so far as might be found practicable.-5-
The War Cabinet decided   *(a) To adjourn the dishussion until they were inpossession of the Joint Report of the Minis-ter of Pood, the Minister of Shipping and theMinist er of Blookade:(b) That it was important that neutral and enemy countries should be acquainted with the in-contentions of Hie Majesty&apos;s Government to assist in supplying them with foodstuffs to such, ex-tent as may prove practicable, as soon asmeasures to this end had been prepared by theDepartments concerned, in concert with thePood and Shipping representatives of theAllies and the United States.BADE.      (10) In reply to a question by the First Lord as to reducingor removing the Blockade, the Prime Minister said that theBlockade was really &quot;rationing&quot; and must be kept up.It was decided  - Not to release the Blockade.whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 11, 1918.

It is only certainconversations which have taken place which enable me tc form any opinion.    Political situation in Germany is at present as abscureto German Mission as it is to us there is no doubt but that conditions in Germany are far worse than were thought.    I   am quitepersuaded that Armistice will be signed.    The term that frightens themmost is the blockade as they fear famine and sickness.    They alsotalk of danger of Bolshevism but I am not sure this was not partof their game.

I left for Pola yesterday Saturday had asked French Haval AttacheFranchet to accompany me but he was unable.On arrival Admiral Cagni informed me of great difficulty with which he had to cope owing to Bolshevist sentiments andconditions anarchy against Jugoslavs ashore and afloat as his forces had been limited and he wishes to avoid any armed conflict!At his suggestion I intervoewed Admiral Koch leader ofJugoslavs who ifnromed me he had little power over his men whohad organised themselves into Soviets for purpose of looting and disorder.Owing to this condition of affairs grave danger existed ofships being blown up and general loot of town.Cagni is us i$g every tactful effort to evacuate undisciplinedtroops and crews.Several thousands already gone.As it was important to get TEGHETOFF and PRINCE EUGEHsurrender owing to the many men and ammunition on board and their being moored to the Ybark near bo town which would be destroyed in case of explosion we impressed this necessity on General Kochand matters were arranged as follows by request of Koch as his menare in sympathy with British;    I landed this morning Sundayalone from boat flying British flag was received by leaders ofSoviets and their following with spiaches and cheers.

Rodd (Rome) No. 1700.Foreign Office.    November 9th,1918 11 p.m.It is of urgent importance to bring into serve at theearliest possible moment Austro)Hungarian ships in Adriatic ports and neutral ports elsewhere.   No proposal to this effect was included in the Armistice and we must therefore take immediate action to arrange this.    There is of course no single Austro-Hungarian Government and indeed it is doubtful how far there is any government and indeed it is doubtfiil how far there is any government at all in certain parts of what was the Austro-Hungarian Empire.At the same time the Italian Government is in occupation of the adriatic Ports.    A Large propotion of vessels are actually in these ports and the majority of those in neytral ports belong to res dentsin Adriatic ports.    There is at the same time a great need ofsupplies in Austro-Hungarian countriesmand it will he reasonable in connection with any arrangement to bring vessels into serve toarrange to send urgent supplies of food either in these or other vessels., and each of the Allied Governments have receivedurgent requests that food should be supplied to Austria-Hungarywithna view to preventing anarchy.The following action is proposed.(1)    That the Associated Governments should suggest to italian Government that they should requisition vessels in ports in italian occupation and endeavour to arrange with owners in thoseports to send orders to any of their vessels in Neutral ports to get ready for sea and place their vessels at the disposal of the
lian Government.    The vessels to be taken as bare ships and to beligned for the present and subject to any subsequent Arrangements to italian Government for management and manning.   Vessels soaged by Italy would fly the Italian flag to which would be addede flag of the Allied Maritime Transport Council.    They would bened by Italian crews or crews provided by the Italian Government and Id be used as directed by the Allied Maritime Transport Council,being clearly understood that whether the vessels remain undermanagement of the Italian Government or are by subsequent arrange-jat managed by another Associated Government they will in any caseunder direction of the Allied Maritime Transport Council.    Thesels would be regarded as held in trust and subject to ultimateposition in accordance with the terms of Peace.(2)    The several Governments in Austria Hungary to be informed the Associated Governments or by the Italian Government on theiralf that the above action has been taken and that the intentionto use the vessels for conveyance of supplies to Austria HungaryI to other countries according to the decisions taken by thelied Supply and Transport organization. Itshould be added that theBoeiated Governments are prepared to consider giving emergencySistance in provision of food supplies.    This will be arrangedthe Inter-Allied Food Council in London to which any applicationuld he made by the several Austria-Hungarian Governments withII information as to both the necessity and proposed distribution.js an essential condition that all purchases of imported commoditiesIII be made through this organzation and subject to its assent.Ither details to te arranged hy the AM.T.C.    You should immediatelyFrench,proach the   United States   Government and ask their assent to thisItalianbposal stating that it is made on the unanimous advice of permanentpreservatives of the four countries on the A.M.T.C.Very urgent reply desired.Sent to Paris Ho. 2417, Washington and Rome.
