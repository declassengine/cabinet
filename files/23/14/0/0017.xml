WAR CABINET 408 A.

DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10, Downing, Street, S.W. on Friday, May 10, 1918, at 11-30 a.m.

RU?IA. Destruction of the Baltic Fleet.

(1) The War Cabinet had under consideration the question of the destruction    of the Baltic Fleet, referred to in a Memorandum by the Admiralty, dated May 9, 1918 (Appendix).

The First Sea Lord stated that the Naval Attaché at Petrograd had reported that a scheme was on foot for blocking the entrance to Kronstadt harbour with three British steamers, and for destroying four Dreadnoughts, of the NOVIK class, of the Russian Baltic Fleet. The payment to be made for  services rendered would be about  £300,000, and the Cabinet were asked for a decision as to whether the scheme should be proceeded with or not.

The Chancellor of the  Exchequer said that, from the Treasury point of view, he wished to know whether the Admiralty were satisfied that the money would be well invested.

The First Lord said that, if the War Cabinet decided to adopt the scheme, the money was well worth spending.

From the Foreign Office point of view, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that, if the proposed operation was successfully carried out, there would certainly be a strong remonst?nce that we had sunk Russian ships and blown up Russian sailors.   He reminded the cabinet of our policy, which had been to urge the Russian Government to destroy the Baltic Fleet, but to use the Black Sea Fleet


i71Jr Ito keep eoauaand of the Black Sea.   3 hat had happened hadbeen that the Ruse lane had lost ooiawand of the Black SeaFleet * owing either to the failure of U. Trotski or of the admiral Commanding.   Mr Balfour said it was a question forisv; Cabinet to decide, ^eov^-^- Xu^3 T U o^XCrtX l^^w^The Priioe Minister said that he was of opinion that aCabinet meeting might, to he specially held for the purposeof ye viewing the whole of our Russian policy;   whether weshould try to re-organise Russia with military force, inorder fhai Gewan Divisions Might be absorbed, or whether we suet abandon altogether any attempt in that direction.Such a decision must necessarily be taken, first, beforesettling the question raised in regard to the destructionof the Baltic Fleet,The &quot;ar Cabinet decided thatt-A special Cabinet, to dismiss the Russiansituation, should be held on the following morning.(rbLANd. (a) With reference to &apos;--?ar Cabinet 407, Minute 5, the &quot;?war cabinet  further considered&apos;their Irish policy in vie-% ofthe impending departure for Ireland, that evening, of theViceroy and Chief Secretary.Long said that the whole of the evldtaoe from Ire-land had led him to the conclusion that it would be folly toattempt to carry out at this stage either conscription or      /Home Rule.   All responsible persons were agreed that it would&apos;not only be foolish, but criminal, to introduce a new eonsti-tut ion in a country that is in open r evolt against the law.For 10 or IS years past the ordinary form of government had 1been largely- in abeyance in Ireland, and, owing to the relax-??atlon of ad^nistratine supervision, young men -had been       &apos; ;taught since they were children to repudiate the BritishGovernment.   Secondly, it was essential that nothing should,]!be done by the new Irish Government which would involve the.p.;1
abandonment of the policy set forth by His Majesty&apos;s Government. On both these points he (Mr Long) was in complete agreement with Lord French and Mr Shortt.   It was important to obtain some time during which a new atmosphere might be produced in Ireland. That, too, was the view taken by the Cabinet Committee which had met on the previous day. Its members were agreed that, as a preliminary to proceeding with the Government&apos;s policy, either in respect to conscription or of the grant of self-government to Ireland, it was first necessary that the new Irish Administration should restore respect for the Government, enforce the law, and, above all, put down with a stern hand the Irish-German conspiracy which appeared to be widespread in Ireland. In accordance with this view, the Leader of the House had an-? yesterday that the Government was not ready to proceed with a Home Bale Bill before Whitsun. He had circulated a short Paper setting forth the views, expressed at yesterday&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet Committee (Paper G.T.-4487). The sanction of the Cabinet was now asked for the issue of a Proclamation dealing with the present situation in Ireland.

(Mr Long read the Draft Broclamation) ?.

The Goverment of Ireland were advised that steps could be taken, under the Defence, of the Realm Act, to put down the leaders of rebellion in Ireland.    The arrest of the more extreme leaders would, it was hoped, have the effect of driving a wedge between the extreame Sinn Feiners, on the one hand, and the Catholic hierarchy and the moderate Nationalists on the other. The first thing to do was to




teach the people of Ireland that they must obey the law. He wished to draw the special attention of the special attention of the War Cabinet to the concluding paragraph of the Proclamation, which contained an appeal on behalf of voluntary recruiting. There was a unanimous feeling in Ireland that in this matter, as compared with England, Ireland had not been fairly treated.

Mr Bonar Law said that the inference would be drawn from the Proclamation, as so worded, that the Government were not going on with conscription.

Mr Long called attention to the words "In the first instance", and said the Irish Government proposed to proceed against those who were resisting conscription.

Lord French asked whether, if the Priests came forward to help with voluntary recruiting - which he admitted was unlikely ? the Government would then abandon conscription.

Mr Bonar Law said that could be considered when the proper time same.

Mr Long said that the Church had got into a hopeless condition. He had seen letters from Mr Healy, during the last few days, from which it was clear that he ? in despair. No-one in Ireland believed that Lord French would not put conscription into force.  The feeling was quite the other day, and the most extravagant rumours of Lord French&apos;s intentions were current.

Mr Bonar Law was strongly of opinion that the proclamation, as drafted, would make it more difficult to apply conscription later on.




Mr Balfour and Lord Curzon suggested certain verbal amendments which would make it clear that while appealing for voluntary recruits the Government did not intend to abandon conscription.

The Prime Minister said that the discussion raised an important question of policy: was the Government going to make an appeal for voluntary recruiting before putting conscription into operation, or could they leave it to be suggested by others, e.g. the Church, when the Government was about to put conscription into force? A further aspect of the same problem was whether the Government should deal with voluntary recruiting now, or should wait for the new Government of Ireland to be set up. He was rather hoping that Lord French might be able to set up something in the nature of an Irish Cabinet composed of men prepared to assist him in governing Ireland. If that suggestion came to anything a special appeal from such a body of men for voluntary recruits would come with great force. He beleived that such a voluntary appeal would have to be made, and he would prefer it should come from a body of Irishmen. He would make a strong declaration in the Proclamation as to the enforcement of the Law and assistance for the Government. He would confine the proclamation to that; set up the new Government, and give an opportunity for the issue of the voluntary appeal.

Mr. Shortt thought that the Proclamation without the last paragraph would do little good. It&apos;s inclusion was by no means tantamount to the abandonment of conscription, but it would have the effect of convicing many people that it was not the intention of Government to deluge Ireland in blood.

Mr. Chamberlain thought that if a voluntary appeal was contemplated, there would be great advantage in making it at once. Mr. Long pointed out that it would not be possible to follow the Derby scheme exactly. The conclusion had been drawn in Ireland that the Government intended to do there in one step what had taken many steps in England.

Mr. Chamberlain suggested that words could be inserted stating that the Government would use the time which must elapse before the issue of the Order in Council, by making this appeal for volunteers.

Mr. Chamberlain suggested that words could be inserted stating that the Government would use the time which must elapse before the issue of the Order in Council, by making this appeal for volunteers.


 Mr. Bonar Law thought that if it were intended to drop both conscription and Home Rule, the policy now suggested might be the best first step.



 Mr. Shortt did not think it possible to proceed with conscription without first giving the Irish an opportunity of recruiting voluntarily. It would then be possible to conscript the remnant.



Mr. Long urged that the real difficulty about proceeding with the Home Rule Bill had changed. It was not the differences between Home Rulers and Unionists which stood in the way so much as the present state of Ireland. The action of the Government of Ireland against German intrigue would be so drastic and widespread that the County will wish to see it through before proceeding with conscription and Home Rule. A tremendous task had been laid upon the Irish Government by the Cabinet at a time when the conditions were different from those of the periods of agitation before the war. To-day the police were disaffected, many officials, some off them in high places, were not to be trusted; magistrates refused to convict, and the Lord Chancellor, when asked to remove such magistrates, had refused. Teachers in Elementary Schools taught that the British Government only existed to be laughed at. He believed that in five or six weeks time, by means of the policy which the Irish Government intended to follow, the situation he had described would be greatly modified.



Mr. Bonar Law said that it had been in the mind of the War Cabinet to lay the Order in Council and the Home Rule Bill together, but it would not be possible to produce the Home Rule Bill until the policy of voluntary recruiting had had time to take effect. That might mean six weeks, and then if the policy were succeeding, a still further period, as had been the case in England.



Mr. Long suggested that the Proclamation should be issued in two parts: the first dealing with crime, and the second, immediately after, with voluntary recruiting.

Mr. Shortt held it to be essential that they should go out


together.

 Sir George Cave strongly supported the issue in two parts, and Professor Adams concurred in this view.



 Mr. Shortt asked whether the second part would contain an appeal broadly on the lines of the Derby scheme.



 The Prime Minister said that that was the suggestion.



 Mr. Bonar Law thought such a procedure would involve the abandonment of conscription and of the Home Rule Bill, but Mr. Chamberlain did not think that necessarily followed.



  General Smuts hoped that the War Cabinet had not decided, as had been suggested, that conscription and the Home Rule Bill were to proceed pari passu. He wished to put in a caveat, and it would be desirable to have Mr. Barnes present when the point was under consideration.



 Mr. Bonar Law thought that that was the Government&apos;s policy, but he agreed that it had not been decided.



 Mr. Barnes, who was unable to attend the meeting, sent the following note:-



 " I have read Mr. Long&apos;s memo, and I agree. But at the same time I have been rather disquieted by reading in the Press replies given already indicating an intention of submitting the Order in Council on the introduction of a Home Rule Bill next week. I am still of opinion that conscription is impossible until there is a better atmosphere; I am, of course, favourable to the projected steps in regard to firm dealing with anything in the nature of German intrigue or Sinn Fein rising: but, beyond that, things should remain as they are.



 It is quite true that the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament has been challenged recently in Ireland, and under normal circumstances that challenge should be accepted, but I am more concerned just now with the challenge in France and Flanders. Moreover, I don&apos;t believe for a moment that conscription could be carried through with all the blood-shed involved; but that it would only be a half and half job at the best, and having started, the Government would be looking round for ways of compromise."


  General Smuts pointed out that there was a danger of discrediting the Government if they made a great deal of pro-German activities in Ireland, and then found out that the evidence of such activities was not very considerable or convincing.  In South Africa, when the rebellion broke out, the proof of German intrigue had been so flimsy that the public were disappointed at the absence of any great exposure.



Mr. Shortt said that there was sufficient evidence to proceed under the Defence of the Realm Act.



Mr. Bonar Law said that even if the evidence were complete, there would be no public trial, and the public would not know what evidence was in possession of the Government.



Mr. Long said he was anxious to obtain the best legal advise from the Lord Chancellor in order to avoid mistakes. There was general agreement that the Government were on safe ground.



The Prime Minister said it was important to make a reference in the Proclamation, not only to the Empire, but also to the Allies, as the Proclamation would be published in the States, and it was desirable that it should be realized that the Sinn Feiners were entering into treasonable relations not only with the enemies of England, but with the enemies of the United States, France and Belgium.



The War Cabinet decided that the Proclamation should be issued in two parts; the first dealing with crime, and the second with voluntary recruiting.
