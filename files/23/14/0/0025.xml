(This Document is the Property of His britannic .jestyys Government&quot;!!    &quot;WAR CABINET 441 A.DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held in the Chancellor of the exchequers Room,  House of Commons, S,W., on THURSDAY,JULY 4,  1918, at  5 p.m.EPION AT (1) The Deputy First Sea Lord produced two telegrams receivedffOSTOK.from H0M.S. SUFFOLK, at Vladivostok, which he read to the Cabinet.In the first telegram it was stated that the General commanding the Czechs had informed the Captain of H.M.S. SUFFOLK that,owingto the receipt of information of the despatch of Bolshevik troops and war prisoners from Nikolsk towards Vladivostok for the pur-pose of blowing up a tunnel about 30 miles from the latter place,he had despatched one regiment of Czechs on the morning of Monday,July 1st., to frustrate that movement and to push forward toNikolsk Grodekovo and so on to Harbin.   The second telegramstated that, at a meeting held on July 2nd.,the General Command-ing the Czechs explained that he needed every available man for proceeding to Irkutsk, and gave details of the forces opposed tohim at various places en route, which t otalled 15,000 Red Army,IS,000 (?) armed prisoners, 50 guns and a reserve of 35,000armed Red Guardso    The General Commanding requested that Alliedships should guarantee a reserve of 1,000 men to be availablefor landing to support the small Czech force left behind in caseof an attack against the Czechs after the mairlibody had departed.The Allied Commanders decided to request their Governments forapproval for such measures.    As circumstances might arise to necessitate this action being taken very shortly, it was urgently
i Ofrequested that an early reply might he given.    Out of the 15,000Czech troops at Vladivostok, 13,000 would leave by July 4thJ10,000 rifles had been given to them from Allied stores, butthey were in urgent need of rifle ammunition, guns,  etc.    TheI       Czechs had taken the tunnel referred to in the previous telegram,and were approaching Nikolsk.The War Cabinet approved the measures proposed,.[0GE OP    (S) Sir George Cave read to the Cabinet telegram No, 2419,[ONERSJr.     from Sir W* Townley, dated July 4th, 1918 (Appendix I) a and statedthat the point for the Cabinet to decide was what the answer should be.    He said that the main point as to the deportation of germans from China had been raised at The Hague Conference, buthe had declined to discuss the question.,    It was necessary tosend a reply to the German proposal by Saturday morning.Lord Robert Cecil read a Memorandum which had been preparedby the Foreign Office (Appendix II), which laid emphasis on thedamaging result which would follow the cancellation of the almostcompleted-^arrangements for deportation.   The cancellation of de-portation would be considered a great triumph for the Germans.It was suggested that the 3,000 or 4,000 Germans now in Chinamight well be interned in one of the islands off the coast, ofwhich there were a great number, and particularly the Island ofLing-Kung-Tao, which lies off Wei-hai-wei, was mentioned.    It was clear that the German proposal was purely a trade matter, and had nothing to do with the question of reprisals,, and any approach to a further breakdown in the matter of German prisoners in china was generally viewed with great reluctance.Lord Curzon considered that, in addition to its being a trade matter,  it was surely an attempt to diminish our prestige in the East, which would be deplorable at the present moment, andwould mean the Allies having to go to the Chinese Government andrequesting them to reverse their previous decision.   He suggested
i 27that we might come to an agreement not to deport but to internGerman prisoners in one of the many islands referred to, wherethe numerous temples which existed could be utilised as habitation-tions *Lord Robert Cecil concurred in this suggestion, but thoughtit inadvisable to send a direct negative reply to the German pro-posal.   He would say that, as far as we were concerned, we saw noreason why China should not adopt the same procedure as appliedto German civilians in other countries. At the same time, weshould let them know that deportation had been abandoned, forother reasons.Mr Bonar Law - suggested that it should be said that thepresent proposal had no connection with other matters now beforethe Conference, but that, as a matter of fact, deportation wasnot now proposed.The question of general repatriation was then raised, to becarried out in German ships manned by Dutch, but the question ofrepatriating men of military age presented difficulties, especiallythat, although the number was very small, probably not exceeding1,000, we had nobody to exchange against them.It was pointed out that repatriation would probably beless tasteful to Germans than internment, but the proposal, nodoubt, would be attractive in appearance.The War Cabinet decided that - Sir George Cave should draft a telegram, to besent to the delegates at The Hague Conference,to the effect that internment or deportationwas a matter concerning our Allies as well as ourselves, and was outside the Reference toThe Hague Conference:    further, that deportation-tion had been abandoned, and that, if Chinaagreed, we were willing to consider the ques-tion of repatriating German civilians in Chinaon the same conditions as German civiliansoverseas.

All the 1600 german civilians in Holland, will be exchanged for the 4.00British without (? other) compensabi.on*   We estimate that this arrangement if fully carried out will result in exchange of 320 British officers and 4500of other comoabaub ranks for surplus of german civilians whom we hold in the empire.These numbers will be in addition to those   whov/ould be exchanged &quot;under the 18 months agreement *In any case submarine crews will bo interned mi a neutral, country.

Arrangements had been made with the ChineseGoverment far the deportation of enemy subjects from China to Australia and the arrangements for theprevision ox shipping for the purpose were almostcompleted when the German and Austrian Governmentheard of the plan and addressed a protest to theAllied Governments including the Belgian Government,threatening reprisals if the plan was carried out.At the same time the Supreme War Council at versailles decided that the shipping allotted for the deportation must at onoe be diverted to brims CzechoSlovak troops from Vladivostok to reinforce the allies in France, the deportation of enemy subjects- was thenabandoned.   This decision was taken partly also inconsequence of the representations of the BelgianGovernment who feared. German reprisals against Bel-gians even though the Belgian Government had dis-sociated-itself from action being taken in China,Sir J, Jordan its informed of the difficultieswhich had arisen respecting deportation and was askedfor an opinion on the suggestion of internment in aforeign concession under European supervision, or if&apos;this was considered, impracticable any alternativesuggestion which he could recommend after consults-tion with his colleagues.He replied that Linkungtao off vlei-hai-wait wasthe
the only place where internment could he made effectsive, and that the Chinese would probably agree tothis hut would require to be assured beforehand thatthe measure would be carried out regardless of re**prisals.   He subsequently telegraphed that theChinese Government had decided to intern the moreimportant enemy residents at F&amp;ngshan and ChusanIsland.In reply to Sir J. Jordan*s suggestion with re-gara to internment at Lingkungtao he was instructed todiscuss the subject confidentially with his Alliedcolleagues and if they accepted the suggestion to ask them to recommend it to their Governments.   In that case the Allied Governments would be informed that ifthe proposal were adopted it must he adhered to inspite of any threats of reprisals.   Sir J.- Jordan wasalso informed that the Chinese proposal to intern 1m-portent Germans only was not a satisfactory solutionand was open to the same difficulty concerning re-prisals.When informed that the arranged deportation was abandoned Sir J. Jordan reported that the decision was a great triumph for enemy subjects in China and ahumiliation for the Allies.   A great sensation couldnot fail to he created by the cancellation of the almost completed arrangements for deportation.&quot;I can recall no incident more damaging to our prestige
