(* -^eWtmjit*^ad^ o r o e..(2) The War Cabinet took note of the two following letters from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to Lord Derby:-0.3./1851.A. 121/Franoe/1957.General Headquarters,British Armies in France.April 1,  1918.Sir,1. I have the honour to forward for theinformation of the Army Council a notifica-tion of the course which I find mjiself com-polled to adopt in order to meet the shortageof men in the British Armies in France.3. Prospects as regards reinforcementsare such that there is no alternative,  inview of recent losses, but to concentrateour resources on maintaining such formationsas contain the authorised number of units,and to reduce depleted formations to cadres,withdrawing, any pe &quot;sonnel remaining to pro-vide reinforcements for other formations.This will have the effect of reducingthe number of Divisions available for opera-tions, but will admit of keeping up to e3tab-lishment such Divisions as can, on a reason-able estimate, be maintained.3. After full deliberation, I have come tothe conclusion that any further interferencewith the internal organisation of the Divi-sion will seriously &apos;impair the fighting
efficiency of the Army as a whole, since I 0consider that the  recant reduction of theestablishment of Infantry by 25 per cent, hasalready brought  the proportion of Infantryto other arms dangerously low.4. It is not possible to determine atpresent which Divisions may have to be re-duced,  as -this will depend on the state ofthe Division when withdrawn from the Battlefront and on the reinforcements available.I have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd.) D. Haig.Field Marshal,0 omma ndi ng-i n-Chie f,British Armies in Prance.TheWar Office,London,  S.W.0. ./1851/A. General Headquarters,British Armies in France.April 7, 1918.Sir*With reference to G.H.Q,.letter No.0.B./1851/of the 1st April, I have the honour to inform you that, owing to the shortage of reinforce-ments, it has not been found possible to 00m-plete the wastage in all the Divisions under my Command.I have therefore been obliged to retain five     NDivisions as cadres only, and have selectedthe 14th, 16th, 30th, 39th and 66th Divisions   r \for this purpose.. A second battle is imminent and may beginat any moment, while the fighting is contlnu-oua and severe on many sections of my frontat the present moment.It is well that it should be plainly under-stood that in the event, which is highly pro&quot;-bable,  of a third enemy attack of a similarnature to those which have already taken place,the force under my command win, in the absenceof reinforcements, which I understand do not exist, be reduced by a further eight or tenDivisions.   The situation, will, therefore,become critical unless American troops fit for immediate incorporation in my Divisionsarrive in France in the meantime&apos;.I have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd.)
