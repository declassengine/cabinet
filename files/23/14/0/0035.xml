(This Document is the Property of His 162Britannic Majestyrs Government).WAR 06JBIMEJ 48 2A.Ii ! DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W.,&apos; [    on THURSDAY,  OCTOBER 3, 1918, at 5 p.m.Present.The Prime Minister (in the Chair):The Rt. Hon. A.Bonar law, M.P.,Chancellor of the Exchequer:The Rt. Hon.the Earl Curzon of Kedieston,E.G.,The Rt. Hon. S.I,Barnes; M.P.,Lieut.-GeneralThe Rt. Hon. J.C.Smuts, E.C. ,The following were also present:-The Rt. Hon. A.J.Balfour, O.M. , M.P.,Secretary of(State for Foreign Affairs:The Rt. Hon.  the Yiscount Milner, G.O.B.,S.C.M.S., Secretary of State for War:The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Reading, G.C.B.,E.C.V.O., E.C., His Majesty^ High Com-missioner and Special Ambassador in theUnited States of America;Major-General P.P.de B. Radeliffe, C.B.,D.S.O., Director of Military Operations:Lieutenant-Colonel Sir MVP.A0Hankey, Z.C.B.,Secretary, War Cabinet.! WESTERN (l) The Director of Military Operations stated that reportsNT.indicated that the.attack by the Fourth Army was going well.The last trench line of the Hindenburg system had been pen-etrated.    There was 8. rumour that the cavalry and Tanks had broken right through, but he could not confirm this.    the objective of this attack was to turn from the south the defences from Cambrai to the Sensee River, which were very strong, and had been most obstinately defended by powerfulGerman forces.    Further north the Germans were rapidlywithdrawing east at La Bassee and our troops were now from5,000 to 6,000 yards east of that town.
1 COJ. D JFORTH-        (2) The Prime Minister said that his main object in in-f&amp;Q COH-IFCE II   viting his colleagues to meet him was to have a preliminaryIrs.discussion in regard to the questions on which he was about to confer with M. Clemenceau.    He thought that these ques-tions would,  in the main, be military, and would relate tothe exploitation of the present situation in the Balkans. Onlyone Minister was coming from Italy, and. he was not yet ssEi;certain whether it would be M. Orlando or Baron -Sonnino.If military questions were to be discussed, if was very de-undesirable that it should be the former, who was more helpfulon these subjects.The War Cabinet agreed that:-In these circumstances, it would be advisable for thePrime Minister to proceed to Paris alone, althoughif the discussion assumed a political aspect thePrime Minister said, he would be glad if Mr. Balfouror one of his colleagues would be prepared to joinhim.JB BALKANS.    (3) The Prime Minister drew attention to the neglect ofak of Brit- the French Government to send us full information as re-ih inf information-.on. gards the situation in the Balkans.    He had received a. telegram from M. Clemenceau in which he referred, to Paperswritten by General Guillaumat and General Franchet drEsperey.General Guillaumat, when he was in the Balkans, was the Al-lied Commander-in-Chief and not the French Commander-in-Chief, and at the present moment General franchet d,Espereyoccupied the same position.    In these circumstances the Brit-ish Government ought to receive their reports in full.    As amatter of fact, they had   never received any such documents..The Director of Military Operations made the suggestionthat we ought to have a superior Officer at General franchet d&quot;Esperey,s Headquarters, in a position comparable to thatoccupied by General Du Cane at Marshal Fochrs Headquarters.The War Cabinet agreedfthat:^The Prime Minister;, at his forthcoming interview,should make representations to M. Clemenceau onthe following points:-(1) The communication to the B . , .      -ritxsh Government
184of all reports from the Allied Commander-in-chief in the Balkans:(2) The appointment of a superior British Officer toj the Staff of the Allied Commander-in-Chief in the1 Balkans.ttlitary    (4) The Director of Military Operations, in reply to ques-fuation.tions, stated that he had no information that allied troops were proceeding to Sofia.    The General Staff knew the ap-proximate positions of the allied forces at the moment whenhostilities ceased.    He had no information in regard to theoccupation of Hish.The Secretary drew attention to a statement in M. Cambonrscommunique to Lord Robert Cecil to the effect that the Al-lied Commander-in^Chief in the Balkans had undertaken not tococcupy Sofia except in case of military necessity.I THE (5) The War Cabinet then discussed briefly the attitude ofllITUDE &amp;2WARDS the Allies towards President Wilson in connection with thePSIDENT     BulgarianJLSOU. S&amp;afcksat/and Turkish questions.    Allusion was made to lordDerby1s telegram Ho. 1177,  of September 30, 1918, in which hehad mentioned the suggestion that the United States Ministerat Sofia had demanded the mediation of President Wilson,andMo ClemenceauTs telegram to Washington protesting against such intervention.    In this connection it was pointed outthat America was not at war either with Bulgaria or Turkey,and consequently had no right to intervene in the settlementswith those countries, and it was suggested that M. Clemen-Clemenceau had probably intended to give a hint to President Wil-son that, in these circumstances, he was not in a positionto dictate the terms of peace to those who had won the righton the field of battle to do so.Mr. Balfour uttered a word of caution in this respect,pointing out that President Wilson had entered the War forgreat world objects.    It might be very importanttwhen we came to close grips with peace terms,for the United States
1.65and ourselves to work together.    Hence,  even though MoClemenceau might he justified in the attitude he had taken towards President Wilson, nevertheless,  it would not he pol-itic for the British Government to associate themselves tooclosely with him.   ,In regard to an armistice, President Wil-son, who was not at war with Turkey or Bulgaria, had no rightto a voice, hut in questions of peace he had this right.The Prime Minister agreed to hear this carefully in mind,although he himself felt considerable sympathy with M. Clem-enceauTs point of view.    President Wilson would send no oneto represent him at these -Conferences, and yet was inclined to object to the decisions which were ts,ken at them.SY. (6) Mr. Balfour summed up the position in Turkey somewhatPossib- as follows: Talaat and Enver are -robably quarrelling; thereLty of yace Over- is little doubt that the Sultan, who appears to be a person-s.ality to be reckoned with, v/ants peace; the Turkish armies,as he was informed by the Director of Military Operations,were not a formidable force anywhere; the longdr the Warcontinued the worse it was for the Turks; it was very dif-difficult, however, for them to shake free from the Germangrip, owing to the German troops and German Officers inTurkey, and the financial assistance they had received from berlin.    In these circtimstances, Turkey was throvdng out feel-ers in Switzerland, and the British Minister at Berne had asked for instructions.    Mr. Balfour then read, a draft tele-gram which he had prepared in the following sense:- nothing is to be gained by discussing peace proposals with any per-sons not fully accredited by the Turkish Government in power.At the present moment military considerations must be held to dominate the situation.    Though,  therefore,  the final termsof peace will have to be settled at the Peace Conference,we must, in the meanwhile, be content with an armistice, asin the case of Bulgaria.   All proposals to His Majestyrs4.
IBBGovernment or the Allies should, therefore, &quot;be transmittedthrough Sir 32, Allen&quot;by0The War Cabinet Discussion.ssed the above draft at considerablelength.    The draft was criticised on the ground that it was rather calculated to deter the Turks from making any sort of overture.    The question was also raised as to whether thepolicy of deferring the final terms of peace with Turkey un-til the Peace. Conference was a correct one.    For purposes ofdiscussion, and without committing himself to them, the PrimeMinister put the arguments in favour of concluding peace with turkey   no?; somewhat as follows:- By concluding peace with turkey, Mesopotamia would cease to be pawns at the PeaceConference.    They would be entirely wrested from the hands ofthe Turks, and although the Allies would still be at liberty to discuss their disposal between themselves, the enemy wouldhave no say in the matter.Lord Cu.rzon reminded the Prime Minister of his undertaking -ing in one of his war aim speeches that Mesopotamia shouldbe dealt with at the Peace Conference.The Prime Minister agreed that he had made this statement,but pointed out that,  if peace were made with Turkey now, itwould he ours and not turkey to dispose, of.    Hence, ifPresident Wilson raised questions of self-determination, &amp;c.he would be told that he must deal with us on the matter, andnot with Turkey.    He himself had suggested on one occasionat the War Cabinet that Palestine might, with advantage, be handed over to the United States of America, but if thiscourse were adopted he would like to have Palestine in hand for us to give instead of its being handed over by the Turks.. Against these arguments were those &quot;which had predominatedin the case of Bulgaria, namely, that it was very difficultto dissociate the questions relating to peace  keeke with Turkeyfrom the general settlement.Mr. Balfour considered that if the Prime Minister were5.
1b ito raise the question of a separate peace with Turkey inParis instead of an armistice, he would almost certainlyfind himself led into extremely complicated discussions inconnection with the Sykes-Picot Agreement (see Minute below).The Prime Minister agreed in this, but suggested that he might sound M. Clemenceau on the question.    If from the g?on-versation it became clear that the difficulties in regard tothe conclusion of peace at the present time were insurmount-able, then he could fall back on the proposals for an armist-ice.    He felt bound to point out, however, that it was quite possible that the Turks might decline to have an armistice,owing to the uncertainty of his future in such conditions.He would very probably demand to know what the general natureof the ^s: terms to be accorded to him were.Lord Milner said that he had originally been in favour ofan armistice, but he felt considerably influenced by this lat-ter argument.Eventually, after some further discussion, the War cabinet decided thatt-The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should tele-graph to the British Minister at Berne in the* sense that nothing is to be gained by discussing peace proposals withany persons not fully accredited by the Turkish Governmentin power, omitting the remainder of his draft telegram.U1TITED       (7) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs raised theCSS OF^ICA question as to whether it would be desirable to send a privateTURKEY.telegram to President Wilson advising him to inform the Turksthat if they would not negotiate he would declare War on thaat.The arguments in favour of this course were that it was de-undesirable at the present time, when Turkey had been severelydefeated in Palestine, and when Constantinople was threaten-ed, to make it as hot for the Turks as possible.    The TurksIwere very much in need of American capital to assist them afHj:ter the War,  and would be very susceptible to this threat.He was wcerta^ ^ ^ ^ ^ f
be accepted by the President, since he understood that cer-tain Missionary interests and Jewish capitalists had greatinfluence with the President in Turkish matters, and. these were understood to he opposed to a declaration of war.Lord Reading said that the Missionary interests were part-particularly strong.The Prime Minister pointed out that the President mightclaim that it was his threat and not the British arms that had brought Turkey to terms, and this would give him a voice in the Turkish settlement to which he was not really entitled.He said t tat from, the point of view of British prestige therewas a good deal to be said in favour of preserving our claimto ha.ve a predominant voice in theatres where the positionof the Allies was due to British arms.Mr. Balfour accepted this view,  and the War Cabinet de-cided that:-IIo telegram should be sent to President Wilson advisinghim to declare wa*P*on Turkey.SYX2S-        (8) In the course of the above discussions&apos;it was pointedOS AGREE-I&quot; out that in any question of peace discussions with Turkeythe French would constantly refer to the Sykes-Picot Agree-rnent.Lord Curzon said that a meeting of the Eastern Committeehad been held on that afternoon, in the course of which lord robert Cecil had communicated the results of a conference that he had held on the subject with M. Canbon on the pre-vious afternoon.    The origin of the Conference, he understood,had been a visit &quot;by M. Cambon to Mr. Balfour, in the courseof which M. Cambon had pointed out that General AllenbyrsArmy had now entered the French sphere of influence, as de-fined in the Sykes-Picot Agreement ox 1916, and that arrange^ments should he made as regards the administration.    TheConference had been held to consider these arrangements.7.
From the Report of the Conference it appeared that it hadbeen based entirely on the supposition that the Agreement of1916 still held good.    He and General Smuts, who represented the War Cabinet on the Eastern Committee, had felt greatlyconcerned on reading this Report.    For some time past we hadbeen trying to reopen the question of the Sykes-Picot Agree-ment, but our efforts had been entirely unavailing.    The reas-on for this was that the French had received far more outof this Agreement&apos;than they had ever hoped for.    The EasternCormnittee had not taken any decision as to what action shouldbe taken*The Prime Minister said he had been refreshing his memoryabout the Sykes-Picot Agreement, and had come to the con-elusion that it was quite inapplicable to present circum-stances, and was altogether a most undesirable agreement fromthe British point of view.    Having been concluded more than two years ago, it entirely overlooked the fact that our pos-ition in Turkey had been won by very large British forces,whereas our Allies had contributed but little to the result.As an objection of detail he pointed out that if General Mar-shal were to   advance to Mosul this place would be treatedas though it were part of Syria and in the French sphere.He thought that the whole ^hestion ought to have been dis-cussed at the War Cabinet before the Conference took place at the Foreign Office.Lord Curzon pointed out that one ground for revising theReport was that Russia had been an important party to theagreement, and was now not in a position to fulfil her shareof it.Mr. Balfour said that the reason why he favoured an arm-istice with Turkey rather than a separate peace at the pres-ent time was precisely owing to the difficulties in regardto the Sykes-Picot Agreement,,and the present discussion only8.
1 i u68jH&amp;tsfi&apos;g^try^-y-g-ts-sry-jm^w confirmed his view.    He pointed out thatthe Italians might he even more difficult to deal with inregard to Turkey than the French.The Prime Minister said it would not he possible for theBritish to go on fighting the Turks simply because the Frenchwanted Syria or Armenia or the Italians wanted Adalia.    he felt very   doubtful whether M. Clemenceau or M. Orlando wouldpress the question, and he was inclined to sound them at his forthcoming Conference.Mr; Balfour reminded the War Cabinet that the originalidea had been that any territories that the Allies might ac-quire should be pooled and should not be regarded as the pro-perty of the nation which had won them.    The theory had beenthat the fighting iii one theatre of war, where there was lit-tie to gain, might be just as important a contribution tothe cause of the Allies as much easier fighting in other theatres where great successes were achieved.    He believedthat some statement of this kind had been made.Mr. Bonar Law confirmed this view and pointed out thatthe provisional arrangement with the French in regard tothe West African Colonies had been decided by the Cabinet6n these, grounds, in spite of the objections of the ColonialOffice.PL AND    (a) With reference to War Cabinet 480, Minute S, Mr. BaffourJBEABYOIQITIONS   read to the War Cabinet a. draft Memorandum drawn up by the m ARM-J-ICK. Admiralty and War Office in regard to the conditions of anfinalArmistice with Turkey.  (Appendix). Although no sxxxKiai de-cision was taken, this was generally approved subject to thefollowing amendments:**Paragraph 1; The British occupation of Constantinoplewas not considered desirable:
Paragraph 4: The proposals in regard to Turkish mercantile shipping were considered to involve too much detail:Paragraph 6: It was not considered necessary to insist onthe Turks rendering assistance, to sweep or remove mine-fields, torpedo tubes, and other obstructions in Turk-ish waters:Paragraph 10: The proposal to occupy trans caucasian rail-ways was considered excessive:Paragraphs II and 12: It would be preferable, rather thanindicating particular localities at this stage, to havea general condition permitting the Allies to occupystrategic points.It was also agreed that, a new paragraph should be added tosecure the removal, of German civilians, as well as soldiersand sailors, from Turkey.fn it eh all Gardens, S.W,October 3, 1918.
