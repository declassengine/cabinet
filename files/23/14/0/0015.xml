REVISE,Bl B E T.(This Document is the Property of His BritannicMajestyTs Government).WAR CABINET 401.1.MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W.,on TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1918, at 12 noon.621 GHANNEIi       (1) The Pirst Sea Lord laid great emphasis on the vitalIts.importance, from the point of view of anti-submarine war-fare,  of holding the Channel ports. . He said that our whole Naval policy in the English Channel was based on theretention of Dover, and it would be a geographical irnposs-responsibility to change.    If Calais fell, he would be sorry tosay what might happen to our anti-submarine campaign.    Itmust be remembered, further, that the French were not sus-taining the anti-submarine warfare; we were waging itpractically by ourselves.(2) The War Cabinet had a short discussion on the pol-icy to be adopted, in North France in the event of furtherretirements of the Allied Forces.    The question had beendiscussed between the Chief of the Imperial General staff and General Foch, and they had agreed that, though import-ant strategical considerations were involved, it was amatter ox high policy for the decision of the Governments.This question, &amp;eveon4?continued^ raised the vital issue of whether,  in certain eventualities, we should or should notuncover the Channel ports, and would, therefore, be dis-oussed in connection with, though probably not at, theforthcoming Meeting of the Supreme War Council.    The PrimeMinister then explained on a map how the question had beenexpounded to him by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.General Wilson had told him that General Foch was stillconvinced that the main enemy attack would be further South,with the object of separating the British from the french army,    in the event of a forced retirement in the Somme
region, there was a point beyond which the Allied Armiescould not further retire without endangering their communicate-tions.    The first thing to be done,  therefore, was to fixthat point.    There was, further, another point in the re-tirement at which the menace would become so great that itwould become imperative to take an immediate decision as towhether the Channel ports were to be uncovered or not.    Itwas this latter aspect of the question which would probably have to be discussed tomorrow.lord Milner said that the problem was mainly a milit-ary one in the broadest sense of the term.Mr. Balfour agreed, but pointed out that vitally im-portant naval considerations were involved as well as calcu-lations as to the capacities of ports and railways, and ship-ping considerations.The Prime Minister said that the problem was, to someextent, a political one in addition, since a decision had tobe taken as to whether it would be best to hold on to the ports until the end, killing as many Germans as possible inthe process, or whether to retire to the South with the FrenchArmies.lord Milner said that if it was possible to hold the ports no one would disagree that this was the better course.A point might be reached, however, at which the ports might become untenable, and if that point were reached both the ports and the Army might be lost.    Circumstances would prob-ably decide for us which course would have to be taken if weshould reach such a pass, and there might very likely be no option.General Smuts was convinced that the menace in the region of the Somme was the more serious.    He did not think that theenemy1s attack in the North had sufficient weight behind it tobring them to the Channel ports.    Up to the present, he pointedout, no real second attempt had been made in the Somme area.
A break of our Armies in this region would be fatal. The lossof the Channel ports would be a great disaster, but not fatal.The question was raised as to whether the relation between this problem and that of Home Defence had been examined?The Prime Minister said he had discussed the question with lord French, who had expressed the view that if we lost the Channel ports he would require 30 divisions for Home De-fence, but on being pressed it had seemed that what he in-tended was that this number would be required if the Havywere unable to intervene.lord Curzon suggested that a point requiring examinationwas as to whether, in the event of the enemy occupying thecoast on the Bast side of the Channel, it might not be pos-sible for them, by means of mines and submarines, to create a lane across the Channel, impenetrable to our surface craft,and across which they would rush the vessels conveying an in-vading army.The question was raised as to whether the possibility hadbeen considered that the diplomatic pressure which Germany had lately been putting on Holland might not be designed to place&apos;Germany in a position to pick a quarrel and so obtain posses-sion of the Mouths of the Scheldt when it suited her.    It wassuggested that, if Germany had occupied both the Eastern sideof the Channel and Holland, the question of invasion would re-quire very careful consideration.The discussion was adjourned, and the Prime Minister stat-ed that it would probably be raised in connection with theforthcoming Meetings of the Supreme War Council.(3) The War Cabinet held a short discussion on the subjectof the recent disclosure, by Monsieur Clemenceau, of a letterwritten by the Emperor of Austria to Prince Sixte of Bourbon,   (in the first half of 1917.
Lord Curzon pointed out that the whole story was beinggradually dragged out in the French Chamber.The Prime Minister said that this would probably beraised in connection with the forthcoming Meeting of theSupreme War Council, and that, if the story was to come out,it might be as well that the Prime Ministers and Foreign Sec-re taries should compare notes on the subject.    The delicateaspect of the question was that Baron Sonnino had throughoutobstructed the pursuit of the Austrian overtures.    After thePrime Minister had read extracts from various documents re-lating to this affair, the War Cabinet-Instructed the......Secretary to draw up a Memorandumrecapitulating&quot; theTvTar Cabinet1 s discussions inregard to the possibility of a separate peacewith Austria.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.,April 30,  1918.
