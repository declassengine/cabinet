1 A /HE WAR COUNCIL     (l) The War Cabinet had before them a copyMan-Power. of a letter from Lord Derby to Mr. Balfourdated 27th August, 1918 (G.T.5549, Appendix     )giving an account of an interview between lord Derby and M.Clemenceau on the above date.THE PRIME MINISTER said that lord derby&apos;s letter raised many important issues,including the vital question of man-powerraised by Colonel Roure&apos;s report.      He himself had discussed the whole question with M.Tardieuand had told him that it was essential thatM.Clemenceau should realise that we were puttingevery available man into the army and that theonly men of military age in this country whowere not yet in the ranks were retained in theirpresent occupations just as much in the interestsof our Allies as of ourselves.      Colonel Rourehad been deputed by the French Government tocome to England and investigate the man-powerquestion on the spot.     He was, however, ajunior officer and not really competent toexamine such difficult questions as whetheror not we were retaining too many men ofmilitary age in munitions,  or recruiting tooextensively for our Fleet.       Mr. Lloyd Georgesaid that he had suggested that M. Tardieu andM.Loucheur should come over,  accompanied by anyexperts they chose,  in order authoritatively todiscuss the whole question with the &quot;BritishGovernment and,  if possible, to settle matterswithout further controversy.     A message had been received from General Sackville West
m&amp;mnting that our reply to Colonel Rowre&apos;a Reportebeuln not he aeni to the French Government in theordinary course through their Ministry -of War, hutthat it should he delivered personally to Si.Clemenoe&amp;u.M.r* Lloyd George said that he thought this was wiseadvice- and he suggested to the War Cabinet that XordReading, should be asked to go to Parish and hand our reply personally to s. Clemeneeau and to request an interview in order to discuss the reply when SC.Clemeneeau had had time to read It.    There were manyquestions in connection with man-power which wouldprobably he brought up at the next meeting of the WarCouncil, e.g. Marshal S?och *e desire that tra should maintain the? present number of our divisions, even ifit entailed a reduction in their alae.    This, Mr.LloydGeorge felt,  was s matter which ought to be thrashedout in the first instance by Marshals Foch and Halgand General retain.After a short discussion,   the Ear Cabinet agreedto the Prime Minister&quot;s proposal that Lord BeadingShould present personally to M* Clemenoeau theBritish Ooverraaent&apos; a reply to Colonel Roure * n Report,and that he should suggest&apos; to M. Cle?.nenceau that&quot;before the next meeting of the Supreme War Council,two Ministers of the French Cabinet should if M.Cleaience-au desired, be invited- to proceed toBngland, aceospanied by any experts they sight wish,to disouas the whole question of British Man-power with the British Government2. The war Cabinet then briefly discussed a. point raised in the second part ox Lord. Derby1 a letter,namely the possibility of the Allies assuming the offensive on the Italian front.In connection with Lord Derby&quot;a statement thatM. Clejsenceau was refusing the Italian demands for munitions in consequence of the reluctance of GeneralDiaz to asauasethe offensive, Mr. Chamberlain said
that the Minister of Munitions was receiving increased demands from Italy for assistance, and this no doubt was partly due to the refusal of the French to help.     Inthese circumstances it appeared important that theMinistry of Munitions should only comply with those demandst authorised &quot;by the Inter-Allied Council,The War Cabinet agreed with Mr.chamberlain^views on this matter.(3)o    THE C.I.G.S. informed the War Cabinet that GeneralDiaz was now on his way to England and was ejected inLondon on Sunday, September 1st,,(4)* Salonica.   With reference to M. Clemenceau^s proposals that before the next meeting of the Supreme War Council, theBritish and French Governments should agree together as tothe military policy to be adopted at salonica, and that, asa preliminary step, General Guillaumat should come toLondon, the War Cabinet decided(a)   That it would not be treating the. Italiansfairly to prejudge the decision of the supreme war Council by a preliminary agreement withthe French Governments(b3   That it would nevertheless be useful thatGeneral Guillaumat should come to london to discuss the question with the C.I.G.S.,and that the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should take the necessary action to arrange this.(e)   That there was no objection to the possiblesimultaneous presence in London of GeneralDiaz and General Guillaumat,(d)   That, if C.I.G.S*, after his consultationwith General Guillaumat, should advise an xoffensive   at salonica, appropriate actionto this end should be taken with the Frenchand Italian Governments without necessarilyinvolving a meeting of the Supreme War Council.E. (5)e The War Cabinet agreed that, in view of thePrime Ministers political engagements, thenext meeting of the Supreme War Council (exceptin ease of great emergency)t should not be* held before:re the third or fourth week in September,-2 / sf? *- - 3 *3/, /9-a-
