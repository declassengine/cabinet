DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street, S.W., on THURSDAY, APRIL 18, 1918, at 11-30 a.m.



WESTERN ?



The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he had had conversations with General Foch on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning last, April 16 and 17. General Wilson believed that General Foch was determined to hold the line of hills Kermel-Mont des Cats at all costs. He had impressed upon General Foch that, if battle were to be accepted here, it was essential that French reinforcements should be forthcoming. We ourselves had not nearly enough troops with which to confront the Germans if they were determined to prolong the attack. Owing to the railway through Amiens being almost closed, it was very difficult to transport troops to the North.

In reply to a question, General Wilson stated that the line Kemmel-Mont des Cats was tactically an admirable one, but a very bad one from the point of bringing up provisions, munitions, etc.
