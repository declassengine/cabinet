WAR CABINET 414A.

DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W., on WEDNESDAY, MAY 22, 1918, AT 7 p.m.

Ireland

With reference to War Cabinet 412, Minute 18, the War Cabinet discussed with the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Chief Secretary for Ireland the nature of the announcement to be made as to the reasons for the recent arrest of Sinn Fein Leaders.



The Chief Secretary for Ireland said that, before issuing the Proclamation, he and Lord French had consulted a number of authorities, including General Byrne, Colonel Johnson, Sir Henry Robinson, and Sir James Campbell, who had been agreed on the general policy, although it was not possible to consult many people in close detail, owing to the great urgency of secrecy. He himself and the Lord Lieutenant had both come to the following conclusions:- that the Sinn Feiners now had a large body of trained men: that they had more arms than were actually known to the authorities: that they had a considerable number of shot guns, rook rifles, and other subsidiary fire-arms; that they were preparing for another rising; that the Sinn Feiners considered it essential for the success of their next rising to have German assistance.



Mr. Shortt then read a mass of evidence supporting these general conclusions. This evidence included extracts from speeches by de Valera, from October 1917 onwards, by Micheal Lennox, by Dr. Dillon of  Dublin, and other Sinn Fein Leaders. He also produced certain details furnished by informers to the effect that, at first, the Sinn Fein Leaders had directed their energies towards the representation of Ireland at an eventual Conference of Nations, in which they had
received the support of the Kaiser, but that, when Compulsory Service was proposed, they had fastened on to this and devoted all their efforts to the fostering of  addition around the opposition to Compulsory Service. There was also, Mr. Shortt said, evidence from informers to the effect that Mr. Pigriss, who was one of the Chief Sinn Fein Leaders, and their best linguist, as well as Mr. Stack, were communicating with the Germans by means of fishermen on the West Coast of Ireland. Mr. Shortt mentioned that it had recently been hoped to obtain information in regard to this communication, as two enemy submarines had been located at Dingle Peninsula, which was sell out of the ordinary ship traffic, indicating that the reason for their presence was communication with the shore. Owing to the criticism system of communication, however, information had not been transmitted in time to enable prompt action to be taken, and the opportunity had been lost. Lord French had undertaken to confer with the Naval Authorities in regard to this question of  communications and transmission of intelligence. The evidence produced by the Chief Secretary tended to show that the beginning of the June was the moment for with the rising had been timed. There was evidence that the Sinn Feiner had been told to make preparations for the end of  May or beginning of June and this corresponded with information extracted from the man recently landed on the West Coast of Ireland from a German submarine, who stated that he was due back in Germany with the Kings of the Sinn Fein Leaders by the beginning of June. Documents had been found on de Valera&apos;s person when he was arrested dealing with the general organization and the arrangements for the rising, which indicated a direct connection between the date of the rising and the German offensive on the Western front.

Mr. Shortt said that the evidence he had given was only a first instalment, as there had not yet been time to scrutinise    


thoroughly the great mass of documents captured at the Sinn Fein Headquarters. He paid a high tribute to the efficient arrangements of General Byrne and Colonel Johnson in effecting the arrests with entire secrecy and without disaffection on the part of the Police. He had some reason to believe that the success which had attended these arrests may have dislocated the whole of the Sinn Fein organization. The Leaders had, he believed, kept their plans entirely in their own hands without any under-studies, and, owing to the extensive arrests, there was probably no one left in Ireland who know the plans. No man had been arrested, Mr. Shortt believed, against who pro-German and anti-English speeches could not be produced. Hence, although he did not pretend at present to have procured evidence which would obtain conviction in a Court of Law for relations with the enemy, there was, Mr. Shortt claimed, sufficient evidence to justify the detention of the Sinn Fein Leaders on suspicion.

There was general agreement that Mr. Shortt&apos;s statement gave a very much more satisfactory impression than a preliminary typewritten draft of a statement for publication which had been circulated to some Members of the War Cabinet. Mr. Barnes, however, expressed some disappointment that no prosecution was contemplated. He was convinced that public opinion would be better satisfied with one conviction than with any amount of evidence sufficient to justify mere detention under the Defence of the Realm Act.

General Smuts expressed some doubt as to the adequacy of the evidence, having regard to the very strong statement that had been published to the effect that we had evidence of a German plot. He reserved final judgment, however, until he had read the typewritten document, including the letters from Bernstorff.

It had haaa proved that Borastorff
knew what was to be done, and this showed the value of the Bernstorff documents. After Master 1916 the correspondence had continued, and various proposals had been made as to how the rising was to be brought about. In the course of this correspondence it was proved that there were two Members of the original Sinn Fein Committee who remained Members of the new Committee and of whom the Government had shown no suspicion. In fact, the Bernstorff correspondence, subsequent to the Easter rising in 1916, showed that the Committee was still in operation and still preparing for a rising, and that Sinn Fein disposed now of 10 men for 1 in 1916.

This correspondence had only ended in January 1917, owing to the removal of Bernstorff from the United States of America. After this we had the evidence of de Valera&apos;s own speeches to show that on the next accession Sinn Fein must be completely ready, as well as a good deal of evidence to show that they would not move unless the Germans were with them. There was also evidence to show that the German were trying to establish communication with Sinn Fein; for example, there were the agents from South America; the landing of the man from a submarine on the West Coast of Ireland; and the recent incident in Dublin Bay where de Valera&apos;s brothers-in-law had been arrested. He would like, however, to know what evidence did exist of complicity between the Sinn Feiners and the Germans subsequant to January 1917.

Even if the evidence were of such a character that it could not be made use of publicly, it would, nevertheless, be a strong moral support to the War Cabinet to know of its existence. He, therefore, proposed that Admiral Hall, the Director of the Intelligence Division, Admiralty War Staff, should inform the War Cabinet on this point.


(ADMIRAL HALL entered at this point).

Admiral Hall laid the utmost stress on the secrecy of his information. To publish it, he said, would be to risk compromising sources of information that were of inestimable value for other purposes than that now under consideration. He then proceeded to read a serious of communications, received from an absolutely reliable and highly secret source, between Berlin and German agents abroad, relating mainly to the establishment of systems of communication by confidential agents with Ireland, and the arrangements for financing them.

Lord Curzon pointed out that Admiral Hall&apos;s statement provided ample evidence of German designs, but not of Sinn Fein complicity.

Admiral Hall pointed out that the Germans had sent one agent to Ireland from South America, and were arranging for another.

It was generally agreed that the evidence was amply sufficient to justify the action which had been taken. If the Government had not taken action an impeachment might well have been made out against them. At the same time, it was generally agreed that the case required most careful presentation to the public.

The War Cabinet, therefore, decided that:-

(i) The Chief Secretary should prepare a draft of the statement to be issued to the press. In the first instance, the draft should be concerted with the Secretary of State for the Colonies and General Smuts. It should also be shown to Admiral Hall in order to ensure that the Admiralty secret sources of information were in no way compromised or jeopardisad. Before publication the statement should be shown to the War Cabinet:

(ii) In his forthcoming speech at Edinburgh the Prime Minister should only allude to the Irish question in general terms.
