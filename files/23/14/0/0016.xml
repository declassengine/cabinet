When themilitary situation &quot;becomes clearer and the fighting settlesdown., I will spend with pleasure some days in i&amp;igland.    Iam extremely touched by your offering to me to receive theHonourable Degree of D.C.L., of Oxford University.    I wouldbe very proud of such an honour.    I rejoice to see you again and to visit the Grand Fleet, a sight certainly unique inthe course of centuries.*During your mission at La Panne, you proposed me to speak always openly to the Members of the British Government.In consequence I call your attention on the fact thatif England and France have common war aims, in a defensivecampaign as now, their armies have separate objectives.The French Army must cover Paris and the centre ofFrance, the. British Army must defend the coast and particu-larly the Channel harbours, Dunkirk included.I write on that question because it involves the vital interests of Belgium and the action of her army.    It is hardly necessary to point out that the possession of Dunkirk,Calais, Boulogne or even one of those harbours would be for germany the greatest possible victory, for us a terrible de-feat, and a direct danger for England and her naval supremacy.How it can happen that the Allies would not be powerfulenough to defend at the same time the two objectives.&apos;Would one abandon then the coast or part of it to use allthe forces to defend France, threatened towards Amiens, Parisor Rheims?Violent discussions 1 will arise in such an occasion be-tween the Commanders.    I hope the British Government has de-finite ideas regarding this capital point.I firmly believe that our common interest is to defend the coast with the most stubborn energy even if we were reduc-ed to hold on the narrow space of ground along the sea, groundprotected by inundations that could be extended from Dunkirkto Calais.More than ever, the fate of Belgium is intimately connect-ed with the fate of England.    The action of the Belgian Armywith the action of the British Army.
The alternative to defend the coast at any price or to retire towards the South can arise suddenly by the loss ofAmiens or the advance on Paris. \ r-      -.- r .rWhat I hear and see in some high military and politicalcircles makes me, $ear, $ in a critical moment, the influence -ofdangerous tendenciesv&quot;&apos;&quot;&apos;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&apos;&quot;&quot;&quot;So I consider as. a:tevwritej^it^tccyo]!-. in all confixence,Moeres, 1st May, 1918.(signed) ALBERT,
