Clemenoeau, addressed to &quot;Mr. Lloyd George, per-sonal and Confidential,&quot; and a report of the interviewbetween Marshal Foch and the German delegates.   He aid not propose to circulate these telegrams, but copies would beavailable at Downing Street for those Ministers who wishedto see them.    (Append h%-. )The first telegram was dated &quot;Paris, 10*30 p.m.,Saturday, November 9th1)., and had been received at downing street, at noon on November 10th.    The second telegram was
received at 5 p.m. on November l0th.

The first telegram stated that M. Clemenceau thought that the Allied terms would be accepted, and that the German delegates had made no observations with regard to the bridgeheads or any Naval or Military terms. They had stated, however, that Germany might expect an outbreak of Bolshevism and that it might be necessary for the German Armies to retire more slowly to the Rhine. The people of Germany were on the verge of starvation and wanted supplies at the earliest possible moment. The main point of the telegram, however, was that Marshal Foch and M. Clemenceau doubted the validity of the signatures to the armistice. The signatures of representatives of a German Government which had not power to carry out the conditions would ,in M. Clemenceau&apos;s opinion, be valueless.

The second telegram drew attention to the fact that the revolutionaries had control of the German Fleet, and that the handing over the ships might not be possible. It also drew attention to the possible incorporation of German-Austria into Germany, and M. Clemenceau urged that the British War Cabinet should send a Minister to Paris to confer with M. Clemenceau. M. Clemenceau had sent a similar telegram to Signor Orlando, asking that either he or an Italian representative should proceed at once to Paris

The account, of the interview between the German delegates, on the one hand, and Marshal Foch, Admiral Wemyss. General Weygand and Admiral Hope, on the other, was interesting as showing the attitude taken up by Marshal Foch. The delegates commenced by asking the terms of armistice; Marshal Foch replied that there were none. The German delegates then read President Wilson&apos;s  Note. On this, Marshal Foch pointed.........................




out that the armistice terms would only &quot;foe eoMEuaioatedif the German Plenipotentiaries asked for an armistice.The German Plenipotentiaries then asked for an armistice, and the terms were presented to them.    TheGerman delegates as ed for a provisional suspension ofhostilities, which was refused by Marshal B&apos;oeh.    they then asked for an extension of 24 hours beyond the 72hours allotted for decision.   This was refused.   MarshalFoefa informed the German delegates that any questionswhich they wished to raise concerning the armistice terms should be submitted in writing to General ieygand.The formal meeting then broke up, and a aeries ofprivate interviews took place,    finally Captain vonHelldorf was despatched as courier to German. MainHeadquarters,      Re left Marshal Foch1s train at 3 o.m.The first herd of the Admiralty stated that theAdmiralty had. just, taken a wireless message from berlin to the effect that the German Government had resigned,and that a new Socialist Government was being formed.The telegram was signed by Herr Ledebour.The Prime Minister thought that some Minister should proceed to Paris at once, but that in view of -publicengagements, he himself could not leave England beforeTuesday afternoon.   Signer Orlando could not reach Parisbefore Wednesday morning if he left home on Monday.He feared that M.  Cleraenceaii had it in mind not to sign the armistice, on the  round that Prince Max&apos;s fourdelegates might be repudiated by the replacing Government.It looked as if four now delegates might be appointed bythe new Government.     After reading to the Cabinet extracts from the Wireless telegrams sent our from Berlin regardingthe spread of the revolution in Germany, the Prime ministers aid that it would seem that events we,e taking a similarcourse in Germany to that which had taken place in. Russia.
He agreed that somebody should go to   tris, but didnot think it would be possible to come to a decision withregard to the desirability of taking the signature ofthe four existing delegates in Paris an;; more than inLondon.   However, it was important that we should eonm.ltwith our Allies at the earliest possible moment,especially as it would seem probable that Marshal Poohwas disposed to go on with hostilities with a view of destroying the German Army and capturing war material.Lord Milner too.sc cue view that the German Army was nolonger a danger to us   and that it was important to get thearmistice signed as soon as possible.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff thoughtthat the German army would break up, but he couldnot conceive it possible that the whole of the German Arraywould transfer its allegiance to the Socialists.   It was questionable whether wo ought to advance beyond theHhine, which gave the best line upon which to draw up withoutgetting involved in BolsheviJs: outbreaks in Germany.Mr. Churchill said that we should not give upsolid military advantages because we were dealing with arabble.     it was essential that we should hold the greatstrategic points.    It was important that we should not attempt to destroy the only police force available for maintaining order In Germany.     We might have to buildup the Germany Army, as it was important to get germany on her legs again for fear of the spread of Bolshevism,General Smuts shared this view, and thought it mostimportant that we should get the armistice, although^ itmight not be any longer possible to get all the termscarried out.The Prime Mini star said that marching men into germany was marching them into a cholera area.    The Germans.
 did that in Russia and caught the virus, i.e. of Bolshevism, It would be most undesirable to march British miners, to Westphalia if Westphalia was controlled by a Bolehevist organisation.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had always taken the view that the Rhennish provinces should, as far as possible, be garrisoned by American troops.

The Prime Minister drew attention to a passages, in one of M. Clemenceau&apos;s telegrams which alluded to the fact that there appeared to be nobody to enforce authority in the German Army, which fact revealed by the difficulty of getting the German courier back to Spa. He feared that there might be a civil war in Germany, and took the view that the peasants of Bavaria and East Prussia would not like being ruled by the Town Socialists. He feared that the French were treating the situation as a revenge for the War of 1870.

Mr. Balfour agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that if any Minister was to go to Paris it should be the Prime Minister. However, Lord Curzon was at that moment in Paris staying with Lord Derby.

The Prime Minister suggested that a telegram should be sent to Lord Curzon asking him to stay in Paris until he received a further message with regard to the Prime Minister&apos;s movements.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff suggested that Lord Curzon should keep the prime Minister closely posted as to all developments in Paris, and the  following telegram was drafted by the Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs and its dispatch? to Lord Derby approved.




fe&quot;Cleiaeneeau had $sked for presence of Brit &amp;ixMinister to discuss now situation as regardsarmistice.   It is almost impossible for Primeminister to be In Paris before Wednesday.If Ours on is still with you please ask himto stay for a few days longer and put him in.eommunlcation with Clemenceau, Pooh, and iemyss.We shall be glad to have his comments onthe ariflistioe difficulty and your own. appreciation of the way it is affecting French, publicopinion.    OB course if immediate decisions of vital importance are required, Prime minister will throw over all other engagements and comeat once&quot;.IJvIOihJ (g)   Mr. Churchill read a draft of his proposals(hit.in regard to the reduction of the output of munitions andthe gradual discharge of certain rauafciton workers, for communication so the Press.The war Cabinet approved, the terms of theproposed, statement;, and authorised its publication in the newspapers on the following day.

An. Army Order sets out the schemefor the early dispersal of &quot; demobilizers&quot;bflficors and men).i Tho following is the notice issued by thoilirdstry of Munitions : J 1. Tho great task beforo the country is tho trans-iormalion of industry from war to peace. Tliisnecessarily involves tho disturbance and dislocation of industries and workshops and very largo numbersOf workpeople will have to change their employment and in many cases their present abodes. &apos;This mustIjc faced. In order, however, that the chango maypo made with tho least possible hardship, and- the&amp;iuimum of waste exceptional arrangements areaccessary. Tho Government intend to recognize inthese arrangements the good work which has been joue by munition workers in helping to bring the warfcp a victorious conclusion.&apos; 2. Tho Minister of Reconstruction on behalf ofje Government proposes on Tuesday, November 12.&apos;*to make a statement to Parliament on tho generalreconstruction policy of the Government, and willjive full details of tho Governments intentions aboutunemployment donations to demobilized membersof H.M. -Forces and civil war workers.I 3. In order, however, that munition workers andieir employers may at onco  be made aware of&quot;e-vernment policy, the following8 instructions areKreby issued to all factories and firms engaged onlork for the Ministry of Munitions : -lij There should, so far as possible, be no immediatel general discharge of munitions workers,ji) All workers, however, who desire to withdrawj from industry or to leave for any reason, and allj workers who can be absorbed elsewhere, should be at once released.lii.) Production on contracts for guns and gun ammn-I nition, machine-guns, tfuaall arms, and small arms ammunition ; trench warfare, mortars, bombs, and. stores, pyrotechnic stores ; aerial bombs ; all ac-!:! eessories of the above stores ; aircraft and aeroII engines ; and the manufacture of explosives,should be reduced in the following ways : -;) All overtime should be immediately abolished ;&apos;) Systems of payment by results should be tern-temporarily suspended, and the customary notice ofthe transfer from payment by results to time-work should be given ,-It) When a transfer to time-work has taken place a&quot;reduction of the hourly  week should, wherever possible, be introduced.    The reduction of hourswill also apply to men already on time-work, andin their case the customary procedure as to re-Jduction of hours should be followed.5?) Whenever reduced hours are worked on a time-tjjfork basis, the number of hours worked must notI be less than one-half of the hours in the present[normal working week of the establishment.    IfUl any case the earnings of the workpeople forthe full weekly number of hours on the short-timeE5&apos;stem, fall below the following amounts:  -Men of 18 and over, 30s. per week;Boys under IS, 15s. per week;Women of IS and over, 25s. per week ;S  Girls under 18, 12s. Gd. per week;their earnings will be made up to these sums by!jhe employer, who will be   reimbursed   by  the&quot;State.   . Where time is lost, the amounts payable*iU be sums proportionate to the number of hoursactually worked.j EFFORTS TO MINIMIZE UNEMPLOYMENT,i    4. The adoption of half time may cause unavoidable-able discharges, but every effort should be made toj minimize unemployment, utilizing employees for aI short period on labouring and clearing up work. In1 allotting tliis work preference should bo given to work-I people who axe ordinarily dependent upon industrial employment.!    0. All persons discharged, or claiming release, canj obtain free railway warrants for journeys from theI place of employment to their homes, or to placesI where they have found new employment. The warrants! will be issued through the Employment Exchanges.In cases where large numbers are required warrantscan be obtained by the employers from the Employ-ment Exchanges for issue at tho works.6. Directions will be given at an early date withregard to war munition volunteers. Army  Reservemunition   workers,   and   other   special  classes   of iworkers.7. Tho foregoing instructions are issued for thoguidance of contractors until individual firms receivefurther and particular instructions from the Ministry &apos;&apos; of Munitions.   Tho loyal and cordial cooperation ofall employers is confidently invited.UNEMPLOYMENT DONATION.1. To provide for tho abnormal period that must jimmediately follow on the cessation of hostilities, Itho Government have a&apos;doptcd as a temporary imeasure the following general scheme of non-con- :tributory unemployment donation, which has been laid beforo them by the Minister of Reconstruction,in agreement with the Minister of Labour.2. Tho broad conditions of the scheme arc thatthis unemployment donation shall remain in force for a period of six months from a date to be announcedshortly by the Government, and that tho benefit can :be drawn for a maximum of 13 weeks during thatperiod in cases where unemployment cannot bombs avoided. The other conditions and necessary safe-guards will bo explained by the Minister of Recon-struction in his statement to Parliament, and he will then also deal fully with the scheme that will be applicable to the demobilized members of H.M. Forces.3. Under this temporary non-contributory scheme,which will remain in force ponding the introductionof a general contributory scheme, demobilized civil war workers will receive benefits on the followingscale :-(a) To unemployed men over the age of IS years,24s. a week. To unemployed women over thatage, 20s. a week.(b) There will bo an additional allowance in respectof tho first dependent child under 15 years of age,6s. per week, and 3s. for each additional dependentchild under that age.(c) There is a further provision for unemployedjuveniles, between the ages of 15 and 18, of 12s.per week for boys and 10s. for girls, conditional on their attending a course of instruction approvedby the Board of Education or other central depart-ment concerned.4. It is necessary that industry should be rapidlytransformed to peace conditions in order to providepermanent and reproductive employment for thocivil workers and for the fighUng men returning fromthe war. The proposals outlined above are solelyintended to bridge over the inevitable period of dis-location. It must be emphasized that the non-contributory scheme is a purely emergency measure.While it is operating the existing compulsory un-employment insurance scheme will remain in suspenseso far as benefits are concerned. Contributions will,however, still be payable in order to build up areserve of benefits for contributors when the tem-porary scheme comes to an end. Thus tho special interests of contributors are fully safeguarded ; inthe meantime, the Government are pressing forward with their scheme for general contributory insurance,which will be based on permanent considerations,and must not be prejudiced by the non-contributoryscheme here announced.
