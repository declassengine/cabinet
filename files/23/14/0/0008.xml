(This Document is the Property of Hiss Britannic&apos;     - Majesty^s Government.)C R E T -WAR CABINET 586 A.DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street, S.f.,on MONDAY, APRIL 8, 1918,  at IS Noon.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read to the WarCabinet a telegram he had sent to General Foch regarding the dangerof separation of the British and French Armies in the event of theGermans bringing Amiens under heavy artillery fire followed by a con-centrated attack on the British Army.    If the Germans carried out this plan they could afford, whilst concentrating an overwhelmingforce to smash the British, to give a good deal of ground in face ofa French counter-attack South of the Somme.    In the opinion of theChief of the Imperial General Staff only two things  could be done:either the French should take over more line,  or part of the big Frenchreserves should be astride the River Somme in order to be in a posi-tion to come to the assistance of the British if necessary. general wilson stated that he had sent to Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig acopy of the telegram he had sent to General Foch, and Sir Douglas Haighad replied that he agreed with the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff and had made representations to General Foch, who, however,absolutely declined to take over more line or do more than place asmall force at our disposal&apos;.    Sir Douglas Haig had asked the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff to go over to France and, with himself,  see general Foch..    General Wilson stated that he was crossing to Francethat afternoon..    The Chief of the Imperial General Staff raised thequestion as to what General Foch&apos;s position was in a matter of thiskind, when, in the opinion of Sir Douglas Haig and himself, theposition of the British Army was in danger.
The War Cabinet deoided that:-In the first instance, the question was oneto be decided between Field-Marshal sir douglas Ilaig, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, and General Foch:    if theywere unable to reach an agreement, theGovernments would.have to intervene.Whit ehall Gardens , S ,:W. ,April 8, 1918.
