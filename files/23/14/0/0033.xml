The Chancellor of the Exchequer read to the Cabinetthe following letter from the Secretary of State for war to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ;**TORY CCdlglDIShTIAk. 17 Great College Street,s.w* 7th Sept. 1918.My dear Balfour,As I am still confined to the house,. I ven-ture to trouble you with some remarks about the bulgarian Peace Move.Of course it would never do to suspendour military action.    On the other hand, I thinkthat, for many reasons, it would be unwise to be toouncompromising and to lose any chance of gettingBulgaria out of the war and so driving a wedge rightinto the heart of the enemy bloc.The right answer seems to me to say, thatthey are welcome to send their xueace emissaries, butthat we cannot consent to an armistice till theyhave withdrawn completely from Greek: and SerbianTerritory.    This, without giving away any militaryadvantage of continued pressure, would leave the door open to a deal, if their peace move is, as Ibelieve, genuine.How often have we said these last twoyears &quot;If only we could get Bulgaria out&quot;I   I think we should lay ourselves open to just criticism if,tinder the influence of an unexpected success, wewere to throw away an opportunity of getting herout on our terms.We have no object in reducing Bulgariaas she was before the war, but only in completelyrestoring Serbia and Greece.    Indeed, it is worth considering whether it would not pay us, if Bul-Bulgaria is now prepared to come over to our side, to
promise her Adrianople and the Enos-Midia line and her original portion of the Dobrudja.I think, if we are agreed among our-selves, we ought to let the French Government knowat once, what our views are.   It would be like themto send a flamboyant&quot;you be d - d&quot; answer without consulting us.Yours ever,(Signed)     MIEHER.The War Cabinet concurred, in the main, withthe views expressed in Lord MilnerTs. letter, except withregard to the reference to our consent to an armisticebeing withheld until the Bulgarians had withdrawn eom*-pletely from Greek and Serbian territory*The War Cabinet decided thatA telegram should be sent by the ForeignOffice in the name of the Prime Ministerto M, Clemenceau, in the following sense:*That the Commander-in-Chief of theEastern Army should be. informed that itwas impossible to agree to an armisticeuntil it was known that the enemy wereprepared to accept terms which would form the basis of peace, but that the bulgarian delegates should be given allfacilities for crossing the lines anddiscussing terms including the necessarymilitary guarantees as a preliminary toa possible armistice.The Allied offensive, in the meanwhileshould be pressed with all possiblevigour.    That, a copy of this message wasbeing sent to General Milne from whomthe message was received^The War Cabinet, further decided that -The Chief of the Imperial General staff should send to General Milne a copy ofthe telegram to M, Clemenceau.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that hewas in complete agreement with the decisions of the YifarCabinet in this matter;     From a military point of viewnow was the time to strike hard at the Bxilgarians, but
Ms view a in this respect were entirely met by the last sentence in the draft telegram.She importance of secrecy in regard to the proposal of an armistice on the part of Bulgaria was emphasized,but during the meeting a message was received emanating from Copenhagen, to the effect that the bulgarian government had let their proposal be known publicly.
flVVil 2*     The First Lord of the Admiralty drew the attentionsrxuATiQJsr0P SUB-      of the War Cabinet to an Admiralty Memorandum G^Oh 5783.CAMPAIGN *     setting out some important aspects of the Naval situation and submarine campaign.     He stated that he had written thatj Memorandum with a view to keeping the Cabinet in touch withthe Naval situation which it was possible to overlook in away impossible in land warfare.SIR ERIG  EDDIES stated that there was no doubtbut that a second German submarine offensive was in courseof preparation and that at the present time there were moreenemy submarines out than ever before*   He wished therefore to bring before the Cabinet the fact that we are going tohave an anxious time and might have to face enormous monetarylosses in ships and cargoes.   The latest German submarines were of an improved type and our sinkings of the enemy werenot keeping pace with his new construction.The opinion was frequently expressed that the submarinedanger was over and he wished this view eradicated.     last march, the offensive plans for the destruction of enemy submarines were disorganised owing to the necessity ofgiving up submarine hunting to a large extent for the purposeof escorting the troop transports from the United States.   Dp- -; - -       &apos;&apos;     &apos;   -    -,0 &apos; &apos; &apos; -   &apos;.  1 - -V     &apos;-&apos;;&apos;.&apos;&apos;&apos;V&apos;&apos;,k:-&apos;;&apos;.&apos;.!&quot;:&apos;-&apos;:&apos;..to last June, good results had been achieved in the way ofsinkings and the Dover barrage had been effective,   Theconsequencewaters in that vicinity were now in/quiet and the enemy sub-marines were going north about and as a result our offensivemeasures had had to be changed,,TEE PIRST LORD drew the attention of the Cabinetto the arrangements that they had agreed to. he. that theNaval Programme for 1919 should be cut down on the grounds that
180that we should obtain American assistance in the shape of destroyers and anti-submarine craft.   He pointed out however that the United States promises were apparently as untrust-worthy in Naval as they had been in Military matters, and.mentioned that only 7 new destroyers had been completed bythe United States in the first 7 months of this year, andthat no further new destroyers would be available from thatsource till January 1919; moreover it was always possiblethat the Americans would retain their output for the protectsion of their own waters.     He further pointed out theserious shortage of guns and mountings for the defence ofmerchant ships, which was due to the War Cabinet decisionto take men from munitions for the Army and &quot;also instancedthe cutting down of the Admiralty Programme of anti-submarineair squadrons.     He therefore wished the Members of the WarCabinet to realise that the Naval situation in relationto the submarine campaign was not as satisfactory in allrespeots as it might be, and consequently, he might have tocome to the War Cabinet at an early date with a view totheir re-indorsing the policy that the Navy should obtainfirst priority as regards its materiel and man-power.TEE WAR CABagreed that :-.In present circumstances it would be highly understandable for the Members of the Governmentto make speeches of a sanguine nature withregard to the submarine menace, for the danger was still there, and though perhaps latentfor the moment was yet liable to break out at any time.fhe War Cabinet took note of the Admiraltyclaim for priority and undertook to give ittheir most serious attention in consideringall man-power, materiel and aerial questions.itehall Gardens,27th September,S.W.1*
