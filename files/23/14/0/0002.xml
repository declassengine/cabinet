He stated that there hadbeen no shortage, but it had been reported to him thatrooming that a big fire had taken place near Rouen two orthree days ago,, when large quantities of wire had been decs-trey ed.The War Cabinet requested the Secretary of State for ftar to call for a report from the Quarter-MasterGeneral on this subject, and to lay thereport before the War Cabinet at theearliest opportunit y.Immediatereinforce-lENTS andtheir T ram3-lOHP.(2) With reference to V?ar Cabinet 373, Minute 8S thePrime Minister stated that he had discussed with Mr-GraemeThomson,  of the Ministry of Shipping, the possibility ofembarking a sufficient nuirb er of men and material if theenemy attack so developed that it was necessary for our troops to  evacuate the Channel ports.    He  stated that MrGraeme Thomson desired information on this subject from-theGeneral Staff., and that he would then be in a position to answer any questions which might arise.It was stated that there were two problems whichwould ha^e to be considered:   the first, which would arise from a surplus of men in the Northern area of operations,
1*I.when it might be  considered desirable to raove fresh troopsby sea to relieve those exhausted.    In this case it would0 not bo necessary to move artillery , and :-ir Graeme Thomsonhad stated that 50,000 sen could be moved daily, either toHavre o-&quot; Nantes.       The second prob lem, which it would benecessary to consider, was the case when it might be neces-sary to reinforce by sea the:- troops holding the Northernportion of the line.The Prime Minister urged that these -pr-obXeae- --should;- ,. -be faced at once,  as they involved the whole question of continuing the battle, whatever might  occur.The Chief of the Imperial General staff undertook to pre.para a Memorandum onthis subject, for the information ofMr G ra e me Thorns on.ESTINE. (3) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that,for the fulfilment of the approved plan of operations,  general allenby was asking for 15,000 men for labour, and for other assistance, with most of which the W$r Office had intendedto supply him.    General Wilson, however * expressed the opinionthat it was desirable that the x^l^n    of operations in this theatre should be modified,  in view of events in Prance,   andthat General Allenby ought to be warned to prepare for areduction in his strength.    General Wilson stated thatGeneral Allenby had under his command three Divisions of white t&quot;troops,  of which two should be temporarily withdrawnfrom the line so as to facilitate embarkation for Prance if required.The STar Cabinet approved that the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff should take actionin this 3ense.SITUATION       (4) Attention was drawn to the fact that the situation inINDIA.the East must be carefully considered, and that if there were serious reverses in Prance a dangerous position in India might arise.
The Prirae Minister,9 on this subject, called attentionto a telegram which he had received last week from the Com-mander-in-Chief in India (No.2-2,677,  dated March 2.1,  1918).The War Cabinet decided that:-The India Office should prepare an apprecia-tion of the situation, which, should take intoconsider ation:-(a) Religious and similar considerations:(&quot;b) The position in India as  regardsvolunteers:(c) The strength of the effective force-available for internal as well as  ex-temal defence, as well as all mattersrelevant to the military position inIndia.Before being circulated to the WarCabinet,  this appreciation should be forwarded to the Chief of the Impe-rial General Staff for his remarks.2, Whitehall Gardens, s      fMarch 27,  1918.
