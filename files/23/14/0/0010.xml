They had made very serious protests against the retention of Officerswhom they Considered incompetent, and had particularlynamed General Gough and General Raking.    The latter, he understood, commanded the Army Corps in the region ofBethune, which was now in retreat,(2) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatthe news this evening was very unfavourable.    The Ger-mans were now quite close to Bailleul in the Worth, andMerville and Yieille Chapelle in the South.    16 german divisions had now been identified.    It had not been or-iginally anticipated at General Headquarters that theGerman attack in the North would be very heavy.    It hadbeen supposed that its intention was to draw as many ofour Reserves as possible to the North as a preliminary to a formidable attack somewhere further South.   Evi-dently, however, the enemy, having gained some success,was endeavouring to exploit it to the utmost, and 4 addi-tional divisions had been put in today with this objeotin view.    The very remarkable railway system convergingat Lille enabled the enemy to effect this.
The French were pushing troops North as fast as theyoould to support us, Taut the movement would necessarily take some time.    One French division had been sent to Dunkirkby rail.    All that Field Marshal Haig could do to meetthe present emergency was to push some of his divisionsUorth as the French came up behind the Southern Wing ofhis Army.    Two British divisions had been moving North thismorning.General Wilson informed the War Cabinet that the posi-tion was very serious.    Bailleul was a very important road and railway centre and very large quantities of storeswere collected there.    Merville was also a very importantroad and railway centre, as was Bethune, which was alsomenaced.    The time was perhaps not far distant when Gener-al Foch and Field Marshal Haig would have to decide whether-er the whole of the Ilnd Army would not have to fall back,abandoning the Ypres sailient and the whole of Belgium.    Inthis case the Belgian Army would have to fall back as wellC\AIn this eventuality it would probably be necessary to put ^\in operation the two schemes of inundations covering res-pec tively Aire, Calais, and Dunkirk.    Field Marshal Haighad informed him on the previous evening that the Aire sys-tem of inundations was ready for application.    Three dayswere required to complete this inundation, and it wouldshorten our front by SO miles.    In some places it was anti-oipated the floods would be a mile wide, and they wouldmake a wide region extremely boggy.    The floods would, ofcourse, form an obstacle to the retirement of our own troops,and special arrangements would have to be made for this.General Foch had stated on the previous evening that theDunkirk system of inundations was also ready to be put inoperation.    If a general retirement of the Ilnd Army be-came necessary, the Belgians would probably have to fall
R   -back on the fortress of Dunkirk.    They could probably holdout there, especially aided by the floods, for some time,If -but before a large concentration of heavy artillery could&apos;% be effected by the enemy, Dunkirk would have to be evaou-ated, as, in that event, it would become untenable.Questioned as to the causes of this fresh.hu reverse, Gen-eral Wilson said that Field Marshal Haig, in order tomaintain his position on his right wing, had been compell-ed, after re-equipping the divisions which had been severe-ly handled in the early part of the battle, to send themto hold the line in the North, which was at that timequiet.    The result was that these divisions had been- at-tacked in force before they had had time to reoover andto settle down with their new drafts.    The enemy1s advaneehad been so rapid that he appeared to have rushed the suo-oessive positions that had been prepared for defence inrear of our original lines.    Up to now the Germans claimeda total of 10,000 prisoners, of whom a large proportionwere probably Portuguese.HE UNITED       (3) The Prime Minister read a telegram No./5&quot;3^ from lordTATES OP (MERICA.

(4) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatI0CH&apos; SfITLE. General Foch, in his recent interview, had pressed thathe should have some definite military title.   At present he said he was merely &quot;Monsieur Fooh tres bien oonnu,mais toujours Monsieur Foah&quot;.   After some discussion ithad been suggested that General Foch should be called the&quot;Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Eorees in France,tt
1 cThe War Cabinet felt that this would not he a satis-factory title, as both the Prime Minister and Lord Curzon,in their recent speeches in Parliament, had given good reasons why General Poch could not be Commander-in-Chiefor Generalissimo.    His function was really that of Strate-gist-in-Chief.General Smuts suggested the title &quot;General-in-Chief&quot;(GSnSral en chef).The War Cabinet agreed that:-Subject to the approval of His majesty the King, the Prime Minister should send a telegram to the French Presidentof the Council suggesting the title of&quot;General in Chief&quot; for General Poch.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 11, 1918.
