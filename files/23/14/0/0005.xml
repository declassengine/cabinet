Prime Minister read to his colleagues a telegram which hehad received from Lord Reading, stating that PresidentWilson had agreed to send American troops for inoorpora-tion by battalions in British brigades up to the numberof 120,000 a month for four months, and more if shippingcould be found.    In fact, President Wilson had approved&apos;  in principle the proposal which had been made to him byI  the British Government, but had offered to do even more;   than he had been asked.    The Prime Minister stated thathe had already been in Conference that morning with Mr.Graeme Thomson, the Director of Transports, and would, re-I  new his Conference immediately the War Cabinet meeting was over, in order that the utmost possible/might be ar-ranged to secure the maximum number of Americans,,IRELAND. (2) The Prime Minister stated that in a second and supplementary telegram which he had received from Lord!:. Reading, the latter had suggested that the effect inAmerica would be very bad if Compulsory Military service were applied in Ireland.    He, therefore, thought it wouldbe advisable if the Secretary of State for Foreign Af-fairs were to ascertain from Lord Reading whether thiswas merely his own view or Colonel House&quot;s view, and what his reasons were for thinking it.Mr. Balfour quite agreed that he should do so.    gereminded the War Cabinet, however, that his own experience
X iin the United States of America, which was borne out by-many telegrams from the late Sir Cecil Spring Rice, wasthat the Irish question always loomed very large in the mind of the British Ambassador.    He thought it would be advisable to telegraph to Colonel House, as well as toLord Heading.    In his telegram he proposed, as the PrimeMinister had earlier suggested, to give a full account&amp;f the measures we propose to take in Ireland, includingthe reason that it would be difficult to ask Great Brit-ain to make greater sacrifices in regard to man-power ,if similar measures were not imposed on Ireland.It was suggested that Mr. Balfour should mention inhis telegram the views expressed by Sir James Campbell,the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and Sir Edward Carson,but it was decided not to do so on the ground that theobject of the telegram was not to ask leading questions,but to obtain an unbiassed expression of the Americanvi etc the War Cabinet decided that:-The Secretary of Stg,te for Foreign Affairs should send a telegram to Lord Reading and to colonel house explaining the measures which the War Cab-inet had in contemplation for dealing simultaneously-eously with the questions of Home Rule for Ire-land and the application of Compulsory MilitaryService to that country, setting forth in full the reasons for dealing with these two questionstogether(3) There was a short discussion as to whether the pol-icy towards which the War Cabinet was trending in regardto Ireland was a right one.    It was suggested that the corn-promise of dealing simultaneously with the Home Rule and compulsory Military Service questions might result in mere-ly stirring up trouble in the Horth as well as in theSouth of Ireland.Mr. Balfour pointed out that the strength of the Ul-ster movement was in the Belfast shipyards, and that toalienate them would be disastrous.11 Gardens, 3.W.,1, 1918.a.
