DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street, S.W., on THURSDAY, APRIL 4, 1918, at 3.30 p.m.

(1) The Secretary of State for War stated that a question had arisen as to the restriction in the use of the railways that would occur in the event of Amiens being captured or rendered untenable for our use. This raised the question of feeding the civil and military population in the vicinity, and the provision of coal to and from that district. He added that the Quarter-Master-General and General Travers Clarke were present with a view to explaining the situation to the War Cabinet.

General Travers Clarke stated that he considered it essential that we should look, ahead and go into the matter of transportation and shipping in case we lost Amiens and,  consequently, our rail facilities to the Southward. This would render supply exceedingly difficult, and it was at present restricted owing to a portion of the line having been handed over to the French for military purposes in connection with the French concentration near Amiens. This had necessitated the feeding of the Army from the Channel ports instead of from the Northern Channel ports instead of from the district of Abancourt-Bargies, where ? of our supplies


were at present located.    This was 12 to 15 miles S.W. ofAmiens.   In the event of Amiens being denied to us altoge-ther, three points arose;    first, coal would not be forthcom-ing from the Bruay mine area f o -&apos; supplies to the South of france ;    secondly, food would not be forthcoming for theFrench and Belgian civil and military populations in thearea of the British Array, which meant that we should have tosupply it, and also the raw materials for steel works, paperfactories, etc.;    thirdly, we at present obtained ISC,000tons of timber a month from the South, for the supply of which other arrangements would have to be made.    He added thatmechanical transport would not overcome the difficultieswhich would arise, and thai the laying of new railway lines to cope with the situation -would be an extremely lengthyoperation. He was of opinion that, a3 regards the feedingof the civil population, about three-fourth3 were, except atharvest-time, fed from the South of France.    General TraversClarke continued that he had been sent across by Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig, with a view to ascertaining the policy ofthe Government in this matter,in the event of Amiens becominguntenable, primarily on the question of ooal supply, and,secondly, on the question of food for the civil pooulation,as to whether we were to take steps to feed the French and belgians in the Northern portion of France.    He added that,as far as he had observed, there wag not in that region, atpresent, an excess of food. Ho-ortdod that,Whlle he had no precise information as to either the supply of, or the demands upon, food in that district, he estimated that 50,000 tons would be required monthly.The War Cabinet held the view that an obligation restedon the French to ration and feed their own people, and, fur-thermore, to direct, as far as possible, the  stream of refugeesto the Southward.The War Cabinet decided that:-
In the first instance it. was a questionof shipping and military organisationmore particularly affecting the Frenchand ourselves, and consequently the wholefacts of the case should be sent as soonas possible to Versailles, by the Chiefof the Imperial General Staffs and thatthe Military Representatives should, in&apos; (&quot; conjunction with General Nash and a re-presentative of the Shipping Controller,enquire into the matter and render a re-port to the War Cabinet at the earliestpossible date.IE HIGH (&amp;) The War Cabinet had some discussion as to the suita-iMAND ANDAPF APPOINT-inviolability of the officers holding certain high Commands andpPS IK THEpriSH BXPE- Staff appointments in the British Expeditionary Force, France.:ticnary5R0E. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was asked toconsider the natter in the light of the discussion, and advise!what change3, if any, he would recommend.IE RECENT (3) The War Cabinet discussed the general lines of theiTTLE.- statements to be made in the House of Lords and the House of,atement si Parlia-       Commons in regard to the recent fighting on the Western Frontfnt,It was pointed out that there would be great difficulty,1owing to the lack of definite information, in giving the causes of the reverse that ted taken place, although Parlia-ment would certainly expect to receive particulars.    Thedifficulty would be further increased(a) By having to meat the question, which would almost inevitably be put, as to where theArmy of Manoeuvre was;(b) By having to explain the necessity of general foch&apos;3 appointment, and thereby admittingthat the two Armies had not been working inperfect co-ordination;(c) By having to deal with the opposition, of theIrish Party, who, in order to regain popular-it y in Ireland, might be expected to say thatthere would be no need for conscription InIreland if the Armies were properly handled.The Chief of the Imperial General staff was asked to make suggestions in regardto the statements to be made In Parliament,and. to submit them to the Prime minister before Sunday next, April 7th.* Whitehall Gardens,  S.W., -S-; April 5, 1918.
