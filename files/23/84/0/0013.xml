O Q Q*C 0 0rptfig ITALO- 1.  The Cabinet had. before them the followingABYSSINIANDISPUTE. documents in connection with the Italo-AbyssinianQuestion of Dispute:-Sanctions .A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-159 (56)) on the question of sanctions, outlining the courses open to the Government, recommend-ing the immediate raising of sanctions in existing circumstances,and attaching a draft of a statement.   .  . to be made in the House of Commonsf . ft. A- S C / announcing the Government&apos;s policywithout previous consultation withany foreign Government:A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (C,P.r-164 (36))circulating a record of a conversa-tion on June 9th between Mr Pirow,the Lord Privy Seal and himself,in which the future of sanctions andthe German problem were discussed:A Note by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs ( CP.-166 (36))circulating for the information ofhis colleagues a record of a further discussion which the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and himself had had with representatives of theDominions on the subject of sanctions and the Italo-Abyssinian dispute.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the Italian ambassador had seen Sir Robert&quot; Vansittart on the subjectreferred to in Conclusion 1 (a) of the meeting referred to in the margin.   He had not yet receivedSir Robert Vansittart&apos;s report, but he understoodthat the reply had been very satisfactory and thatthere was reason to believe that Signer Mussoliniwould give to the League the assurances that he hadalready given to His Majesty&apos; s Government.    Therewere, however, some uncomfortable rumours from Romethat day that the Italian Government was inclined tomake resumption of co-operation with the League Powersdependent not only on the lifting of sanctions butupon the practical abandonment by the League of theprinciple that situations created by force cannot be(previous reference:Cabinet 41(35), Con-clusion 1.)
recognised.   As yet he had no confirmation of this.While the general policy proposed by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affaira was accepted ^ various suggestions were made .One such suggestion was that steps should, be takento avert the risk that the French Government, while not opposing the raising of sanctions, might say thatbut for our initiative they would have been prepared,to continue them.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said,he had considered whether it would, be advisable totake some further step with the French Government.For some time he had been trying to obtain informationas to their attitude, but all he could, learn was thatat Geneva they would support His Majesty^ s Government.He had. felt that if he were to send a further messagethey might reply as had been suggested, above, and. thatit was better not to give them the opportunity.The view was expressed that Prance needed, ourco-operation so badly that they were not likely toadopt a line that would cause us embarrassment.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat before making his speech in the House of commons on the following afternoon he proposed to see not onlythe French Ambassador but also the Ministers of Yugo-Slavia, Greece and. Turkey, and to inform them of thegeneral tenor of his forthcoming statement.   He would,add, in the case of the French Ambassador, that he hoped, that this would, be acceptable to the FrenchGovernment 0The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that a further conversation hadtaken place on the previous afternoon with the High -Commissioners of the Dominions .   He paid, a tribute to
the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for findingtime to attend this as well as several earlierconversations, which had resulted in very full consultation with the Dominions .   The present position was as follows:-   Australia supported the policy of raising sanctions.   The New Zealand Government wouldlike sanctions to he continued and increased, but were likely to fall into line with whatever we pro-posed.    The Irish Free State Government favoured thecontinuance of sanctions unless it involved risk ofa European war, and it might be possible to obtain their support by stressing the grave risks to theEuropean situation involved in sanctions .    There wasno indication whatever of the Canadian attitude, butthere was to be a debate on sanctions on Thursday in ottawa.   The South African Government favoured an indefinite continuation of sanctions, in the anticipa-tion that they would, force Signor Mussolini to askfor terms.    The South African Nigh Commissioner mighthave been willing to compromise on a postponementuntil the League Meeting in September.   At present,at Genevahowever, he was likely to argue/ against the policy ofthe Cabinet, which was unfortunate but must not betaken too   tragically, and would not stand in the wayof further consultation and co-operation over whatwas to be done at the League.A suggestion was made that it was rather an advantage that from time to time a Dominion should,take an independent line, so as to show to foreign nations that there was no -&quot;united front&quot; between theUnited Kingdom and. the Dominions .A further suggestion was made that the financialcondition of Italy was likely in the near future to
Governmentbecome so bad that the/ would be compelled, to cometo us for financial assistance, and. that this wouldbe an opportunity to obtain in return some of the declarations that the Union of South Africa desired.Could not the ,;-Tigh Commissioner, it was asked, be told o&apos;p this opportunity that was likely to arise,in which case he might be willing to come into line with ourselves on the present occasion.This proposal did. not commend itself to theCabinet, on the ground that such a statement to the^igh Coromissioner of South Africa would, involvecommitting the Cabinet to a policy of advancingmoney to Italy, which had. certainly not been decided.The Cabinet were informed.. that the policy nowproposed, would, have a bad. effect in India;   would tend to stimulate the movement there for leaving theLeague of Nations;    and might increase the loss of prestige of this country resulting from events in abyssinia.    This would, happen at a time when thesituation in Palestine was also being taken more seriously.    It was unfortunate that, just as we wereapproaching the introduction of the new constitution in India, events had. taken a turn rather adverse toBritish prestige.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he wished to intimate in his speech, subject to theagreement of the First Lord, of the Admiralty, thatafter the withdrawal of sanctions the British forcesin the Mediterranean would be larger than they had.been before the Abyssinian situation arose .   This didnot mean, of course, that the Fleet would have to bemaintained at its present strength in the mediterranean-&apos;nean*
The First Lord, of the Admiralty acquiesced, in theproposal, hut asked, that, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should, mention the matter in rathergeneral terms, speaking of the Imperial Forces as awhole being strengthened, rather than the Fleet only.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed,to this.The question was raised as to the terms of thelast paragraph of the draft statement in the House ofCommons (Annex to C.P .-1^9 (35)) in which it wassuggested that the assurances which were given earlierby this country to certain countries in the eastern mediterranean should not end. with the raising, of sanctions.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence quotedthe following passage from the paragraph in question:-*The countries concerned, may reasonably expect that the same assurances ofassistance should, be considered tocover the period, of uncertainty whichmust necessarily follow the terminationof action under Article 16&quot;.This, he pointed out, appeared to be inconsistent withthe following passage in the Secretary of State&apos;sMemorandum on Mediterranean problems (CP.-165 (36)):-&quot;They&quot;  (viz.,  certain countries in the balkans and. Eastern Mediterranean)&quot;automatically are depriver&quot; of theguarantee of the other League Members,and. more particularly of Great  Britainand. France, which they enjoy under paragraph 3 of Article 15 of theCovenant&quot; ( CP.-165 (.55).  oaee 2.Par?.(i) of the Memorandum) .He had. no objection to a. mere continuation of the mutual obligations und.erta.ken under Article 15,Para .5, of the Covenant, but if those covenants had come to en end he had grave doubts about the assump-tion of any further oblige.t.ions .
&quot;Tie Home Secretary, after quoting Article 16,Para .3, of the Covenant, expressed the view that in law the undertakings for mutual support which had.been given last autumn did not in fact come to anend. with the raising of sanctions .   T-Te suggested.that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs mightdeal with the matter in some such terms as thefollowingLet no-one assume that the mutualassurances which were given inconnection with the application of sanctions are dropped, when sanctionscome to an end.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defencerepeated, that he had. no objection to a statement ofthat kind  indicating that, the existing mutual under-takings remained in being,    vfhat he disliked, was theidea of a new undertaking which seemed, to be conveyedin the following extract from the last paragraph ofthe Annex to CP.-159 (35):-&quot;Should, therefore, the League decide to raise sanctions, r-Tis Majesty&apos;sGovernment intend, with a view tothe establishment of confidence inthe regions concerned, to give suchassurances in due and. formal mannerat Geneva&quot; .He agreed with.the general lines proposed, by theHome Secretary .The Prime Minister said, it should also be pointedout that it applied to all the countries that had made the undertaking -The First Lord, o^ ^he Adi.aira.lty also urged,avoidance of any language that implied a new under-taking &quot;in due and. formal manner&quot; .   He suggested thatthe continuation of the undertaking should, betreated, as a matter of course, and that it should, bemade clear that it was not unilateral but binding onall the countries that ha^1 given such undertakings.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that what was really challenged was the statement inparagraph (i) on page 2 of CP.-165 (56), that thecountries in question &quot;automatically are deprived of&quot;the guarantee of the other League Members, and more&quot;particularly of Great britain and. Prance, which&quot;they enjoy under paragraph 3 of Article 16 of the&quot;Covenant&quot;.   That assumption appeared incorrect.The Home Secretary pointed out that if sanctionswere ended on a Monday and Italy attacked Greece orTurkey on the Tuesday, it was obvious that theundertaking would, not have come to an end.The Cabinet were also reminded, that the guaranteeswere not given individually by the different nations,but mutually.    Unless the matter was so put as to appear as a mutual continuing obligation theimpression would be given that we were undertaking a new obligation.The Secretary of State for Pominion affairs pointed, out that if anything in the nature of a newcommitment was involved, the Dominions would, have tobe consulted.    If, therefore, anything in the natureof a new commitment was involved, he wTould. have toask for a postponement to give time to consult the -Dominions .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidhis object ha^ been rather to bring out the factthat this country was not by any means a negligiblefactor in the Mediterranean.   He undertook, however,to revise his statement to meet the views of hiscolleagues.One suggestion was &quot;that in the &quot;third, and. fourthparagraphs of the Annex to CP.-159 (36) the language was rather unnecessarily apologetic.
2 9 &apos;t)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said,that the Annex to CP.-159 (36) was already in process of very considerable revision, but he would,give careful consideration to the various suggestions that had been made.^he Cabinet agreed.  (a) To approve the general line proposedby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in C.P.-159 (36), namely, thatthe policy of the Government should beto take the initiative at the Leagueof Nations in proposing the raising of sanctions against Italy, and that theSecretary of State should announce thepolicy in the first place in the Houseof Commons without previous consultationeither with the French or the Italianor,  indeed., any other foreign Government(See, however, (d) below, as to a priorcommunication to the representatives ofcertain Governments):(b) To approve the broad lines of the draft statement for the T^ouse of Commonscontained in the Annex to CP.-159(36), subject to an amendment of thelast two paragraphs in order to avoid any possibility of an inference being drawn that we were undertaking some new and unilateral commitment;    the emphasis being laid rather on the factthat the mutual assurances given last autumn by certain countries that wereespecially exposed to retaliation by italy for sanctions did not come to anend. when sanctions were dropped:(c) To leave the terms in which the State-ment was to be revised, to the discretion of the. Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs:(d) To take note that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs proposed to see theFrench Ambassador and. the Ministers of greece, Turkey and Yugo-Slavia before his forthcoming speech in Parliament,in order to communicate to them thegeneral line which he proposed to take.
THE MEDITERRANEAN.    2.     The Cabinet had before them a   MemorandumProblems facing     by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsHis Ma jesty&apos;sGovernment. ( CP.-165 (35)) on the problems facing His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the Mediterranean as a result of the Italo-League dispute and. the Italian conquest of abyssinia, and on the special measures that mightbe necessary in order that British prestige and power in the Mediterranean might be restored,  and perhaps also in order that Italy might be deterred from further &quot;expansion&quot; to our detriment.   From hisanalysis of the situation the Secretary of Statederived the following conclusions:-(I)  If sanctions are withdrawn by theLeague, we ought at once, without waiting for the French, to statethat we still are ready during thepresent period of uncertainty tocome to the assistance of our recentDealt with collaborators in the mediterranean in Oonclu- in the circumstances set forth in thesion 1 above, attached, draft Declaration. 58(IT) We ought not In present circumstances to hope to restore the prestige ofthe League by any special arrangements regarding the Mediterranean.( III) The Chiefs of Staff should, be ashedforthwith to report on the strategicalquestions raised in this paper, and. onthe validity of the assumptions onwhich the proposals in this paper are based..(TV) When we see, after sanctions have been withdrawn, how the situation develops,we ought  subject to the views of theChiefs of Staff   to consider further the question of an Eastern Mediterraneanunderstanding with Turkey and. Greeceon the lines suggested, in this paper.(v) While a. general Mediterranean Pactwithout  Italy would in all circumstances be open to serious objection, the time may come when some sort of MediterraneanPact, including France and. Italy, may prove useful as part of, anr- in orderto facilitate, a general detente with italy.    We have not, however, at presentreached, the stage when such a step need be co n t. em plated.
The President of the Board of Trade hopedthat the Cabinet would not discuss this question until they had received the views of the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee on the Committee of Imperial Defence onthe proposed new commitments in the EasternMe di t e rrane an *The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said he had already discussed the matter in a preliminaryway with the Chiefs of Staff Committee as he had understood, that it might be raised at that morning1smeeting.     He would, however, be glad of further time to explore the matter with them.The Cabinet agreed.:(a) To postpone consideration of cp. 165 (36) until their next regular weekly meeting.(b) That the Minister for Co-Ordinationof Defence should, in the meanwhile,circulate the views of the Chiefsof Staff Committee.(c) That a statement on the strategicalposition in the Mediterranean and near East which the Minister forGo-Ordination of Defence had proposed, to make as the result ofa meeting of the Sub-Committee on defence Policy and Requirements onthe 11 tii &quot;June, 1936, should be postponed until the discussions onthe Mediterranean referred to above.

TTTRKEY.^he StraitsConvention ofLausanne .Montreux Con-ference toconsiderRevision of.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(24)Conclusion 5)5a Tbe Cabinet bad. before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-168(36)) relating to the Montreux Conference to considerthe revision of the Straits Convention of Lausanne.The Conference was being held at the suggestion ofthe Turkish Government, whose main desideratum wasto obtain the right to re-fortify the Straits .The matter had. been considered by the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee, who had. agreed that the balanceof advantage, from the point of view of Britishinterests, would be in allowing the Turks the rightthey desire .    The Secretary of State therefore proposed, that Lord Stanhope, who would, lead theUnited. Kingdom Delegation, should be authorised toagree at once to the abrogation of those Articles ofthe existing Straits Convention which provide forthe demilitarisation of the Straits Zone, and toaccept any solution, relating to revision of the clauses of the Convention dealing with the passageof warships through the Straits, on which the ForeignOffice and. the Admiralty agreed..   As the originalConvention was signed on behalf of the British Empire,the concurrence of the Dominions would be requiredin any amending Convention which might result fromthe impending Conference.The Prime Minister informed Earl Stanhopethat notwithstanding his new office of first commissioner of Works, he would have to ask him toproceed to Montreux as Head of the United kingdom delegation.The First Commissioner of Worksanticipated that the first stage of the conference was likely to last about four days, at the end of
which a good many members would depart for Geneva.It is possible that at this point the subject wouldbecome somewhat technical, mainly concerning theAdmiralty.     He hoped that at this stage it mightbe possible for him to return to London.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that in that event the First Commissioner ofWorks should communicate with him at Geneva and theycould, if necessary, refer the matter to London.The First Lord of the Admiralty said thathe was very anxious to reach agreement with theTurksa     If we had to make proposals, it might be explained to the Turks that this was being done in a constructive spirit and that v/e were most anxious toreach agreement with them at the Conference.The Cabinet agreed:To approve generally the arrangements proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs in C.P. 168 (36)for the Montreux Conference andthat the policy of the UnitedKingdom delegation should be to try and reach agreement on the lines proposed in the memorandum.
tr. SERVICES 6.   The Cabinet had before them a Joint memorandum the MEDI-&apos; RRANEAN. by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andLtZfaC.)      tlie Secretary of State for Air (CP.-155 (35)) on-   23^37)6.   the subject of Air Services in the Mediterranean,To counter the efforts which German interests were making to obtain a footing in Egyptian, and a large measure of control in Greek,  civil aviation, itwould be necessary to provide, under British manage-ment and. with British financial support, theservices in the Mediterranean which both theEgyptian and. the Greek Governments were determined,to have.    Imperial Airways had expressed their willingness to put forward, detailed, plans for a weekly service on a route Athens-Crete-Alexandria,combined with weekly services to Italy (Brindisi)and. to Turkey (Istanbul).    Imperial Airways esti-mated that these operations would, result in a net annual loss of approximately  25,000, and. theauthors of the Memorandum asked, the Cabinet whether ,on general political and strategical grounds,equivalent payments could, be made to Imperial Airwaysfor a period, of five years .The Secretary of State for Air reportedthat a new factor had just arisen on this question.From information which he had received only that morning from Imperial Airways, it appeared thatthe Horus Company, which was known to be virtuallya German concern, and the^Misr air work company were coming together under German auspices.     Itappeared probable, therefore, that the egyptian government would be able to obtain all their needsout of this combination from German subsidies andwere likely to come to ,us to ask if we would be
willing to give the subsidies ourselves.     from the air point of view, the proposition was not a particularly attractive one and the task of explaining to the House of Commons the reasons fora subsidy foo? foreign companies would not be avery easy one.     Moreover, it was not easy tokeep the Germans altogether out of these routes.The British, Italian, Dutch and. French machines were already flying regularly to Greece and thefirst three were flying to Egypt also.Consequently, we could hardly expect the egyptians to bar out the Germans on principle.The only way this could be done is to subsidiseImperial Airways to undertake a partnership inthe Greek line and[the Egyptian line to beestablished over the same route.The suggestion was made that theSecretary of State for Air should get in touchwith the air work line as a check on information from Imperial Airways. ^ ^The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointedout that,as stated In the joint memorandum cp, 155 (36), the principles on which subsidiesare normally made available would be required tobe justified on political, strategic andgeneral commercial considerations.     In the present case, there were no general commercial considerations and the question that had to beconsidered was whether the strategical andpolitical advantages on the present occasionwere sufficient to justify a subsidy to aforeign government.
The Cabinet agreed:That a Cabinet Committee composed asfollows:-The Chancellor of the exchequer the Secretary of State for foreign affairs the Secretary of State for air should, meet (in view of the urgency of the question) on the afternoon of Friday, the 19th June,to consider the questions raised in CsP. 155 (36) with powers totake a decision if the three ministers reach agreement.     Ifthey were unable to reach agreement the question should bebrought back to the Cabinet.
I THE IRISHI FREE STATE.ProposedAppointmentof a UnitedKingdom HighCommissionerIf in.New Constitu-ition Bill .I (previous&quot;I Reference:i cabinet 38I (36), Con-I elusion 9 .)FR. 4-* (5*9*.7,   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP.-167(36))  giving an account of an interview he had had with the High Commissioner for the Irish Free State,in which he had been informed, that at present Mr de valera was averse to the appointment of a United kingdom high Commissioner in the Irish Free State.    Referencehad also been made to the new Irish Constitution bill which Mr de Valera had publicly announced his intentionto introduce into the Dail in the autumn.   The changes would, concern the internal affairs of the Free State,&quot;leaving unaffected the constitutional usages relatingto external affairs&quot;, and amongst the new provisions would be &quot;the creation of the office of a President,elected, by the people, and the abolition of the officeof Governor-General&quot; .   The Secretary of State suggestedthat the matters set forth in CP.-167 (36) should, be examined, in the first place by the Irish situation committee, which was already considering the questions raised in his previous Memorandum (CP.-124 (36)).In the course of a statement on the linesof his memorandum, the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs stated that his impression of the new proposals was a reversion to the old idea of&quot;external association&quot; between the Irish Free Stateand the United Kingdom,     The Attorney-General, hesaid, was going into these questions.     He had as yetheard no more on the criticisms on the point ofprocedure by Mr. Walshe, an official of the Irish FreeState, which were referred to on the last page of his memorandum.
The Cabinet agreed:(a) To take note that at present mr. de Valera was averse to theappointment of a United kingdom high Commissioner in the IrishFree state(b) That the questions relating tothe new Irish Constitution Bill-mentioned in CP. 16V (36) shouldbe referred to the irish situation Committee.
THE coronation oath.Proposed Alter-ation inQuestion of need for legislation.(previous reference:Cabinet 40(35), Con-elusion 1,)* 7 (yj)^-8.       The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the proposed alteration inthe Coronation Oath and to the constitutional andother questions arising in connection with theassociation of the Dominions in the CoronationCeremonyAn Opinion by the Lord chancellor and the Law Officers of the Crown(C.P.-162 (35)) stating that intheir view the Statute of Westminsteraltered the constitutional positionof this country in relation to theDominions in such a way as to render the existing words of the coronation oath inapplicable and that an alter-ation should, be made in the wording of the Oath so as to give effect tothe alteration effected, by the statute of Westminster, and. that that Statutemight properly be treated as an authority for making such an alter-at ion:The Report ( CP.-169  (36)) of theCabinet Committee appointed at theMeeting mentioned in the margin,whose conclusions and. recommenda-tions are summarised in the appendix to these Minutes.After hearing the statements by the Lord chancellor and the Lord President of the Council, the cabinet discussed the draft of the Coronation Oath as setforth in paragraph (iv) of the Appendix.The Secretary of State for India was in favourof the retention of specific mention of India inthe Coronation Oath.The Lord President of the Council explainedthat everyone was in favour of this if it could bedone without all the Dominions being similarlymentioned by name.The Cnaneellor of the Exchequer suggested thatfor the words &quot;of India&quot; should be substituted&quot;of your Empire of India&quot;.-so-
3 0o xiThe Secretary of State for India suggested thatmention should also he made of Burma in some such terms as the following;-   &quot;of India and of Burma and yourother territories etc.&quot;       The word &quot;other&quot; was criticised as being unsuitable.       The suggestion wasalso made that the reference to&quot;territory-ies andpossessions&quot; was tautological. A criticism of theuse of the phrase &quot;Empire of India&quot; was that theEmpire of India included Native States and that theKing, as Emperor, did not govern them.The Secretary of State for War thought, however,that the term &quot;govern&quot; was not inapplicable to theposition of a suzerain State.The Lord Chancellor thought that the inclusionof the words &quot;Empire of India&quot; would not involve a risk of our having legislation.The Lord President of the Council felt some doubt about the use of the words &quot;laws and customs&quot;.    some in British territories;of our legislations,/he pointed out, had been opposedto the customs of the country.The Lord Chancellor pointed out that when thecustoms were altered by law they ceased to be customs.He thought tine phrase was necessary.The Prime Minister stated that the LordPresidentTs Cabinet Committee would have to considerfinally the various proposals referred to above, after which the teg$t of the Oath should be communicated tothe Dominions &amp;The Lord President then explained the proposalsfor the association of the Dominions in the CoronationCeremony.
