BRITISH^CASTING$ORATION.2.     The Home Secretary reported that on theprevious Wednesday evening, the british broadcasting Corporation^ News Bulletin hadference toSatinet discussions, contained a statement to the effect that theCabinet meeting on Wednesday morning was understoodsviouserence:binet 60 (33)conclusion 5)to have had before it the report of the tribunal which had been investigating the alleged BudgetLeakage, and that this report was then consideredby the Cabinet.     He thought that some actionought to be taken to prevent the british broadcasting Corporation from making suchstatements without authority.     He read a draft letter to the British Broadcasting Corporation (seeAppendix) explaining the situation.The Prime Minister said that the PressAssociation had been told by Mr. Stev/ard that theCabinet had not discussed this srpestion and that representatives of the Press had also been told the same thing by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet were reminded that someof the newspapers gave accounts of what had happened at the Cabinet with some accuracy, butit was suggested that there was a difference between a statement in political notes and one contained inthe British Broadcasting Corporation^ News.The Prime Minister said that an important question of principle was involved.     The british broadcasting Corporation was a valuable means ofconveying information but, unless people could trustit, it might prove useless in times of emergency.He agreed that the matter ought to be taken up withthe British Broadcasting Corporation,     It wasdangerous to have false information circulatedby radio.
The Cabinet agreed:(a) That a letter should be sent to theChairman of the British Broadcasting-Corporation drawing his attentionto this matter and. suggesting thatthe rule should be definitelylaid down that no reference shouldbe made in News Bulletins to whatis supposed to have passed at aCabinet meeting, unless special and direct authority for thestatement had been obtained by theBritish Broadcasting Corporationfrom No, 10 Downing Street.(b) That, in the absence of thePostmaster-General who it wasascertained was keeping apolitical engagement in thecountry, the letter should be signed and sent forthwith by theSecretary to the Cabinet (Appendix).
^BUDGET   :Alleged Leakage(pre vi previous reference:Cabinet 33 (36)Conclusion 1)3,     The Home Secretary informed the Cabinetthat the Report of the Tribunal on the allegedBudget leakage had reached him late on the evening of the 27th May.     It had been sent to theprinters and would be circulated in Parliament nextTuesday.     He gave the Cabinet a summary of theFf?. i-t-4(3t)i  main resuits of the Inquiry,     He warned theCabinet that the utmost care had been taken not togive any indication to anyone of the contents of thereport.     He had not communicated its contents to anyone outside the Cabinet other than &apos;the attorney-General,
4.     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the proposal for sir Miles Lampson&apos;s return had. been better received in Egypt than he had expected.      In consequence,Sir Miles Lampson was coming to England at once and. wished to bring with him the Air Officer in command.The Secretary of State for Air said hehad not had an opportunity to discuss this proposal with the Chief of the Air Staff, but he feltjustified in agreeing to his return.
rptrs; ITALO- 5. The Cabinet resumed the discussion, begunABYSSINIANDISPUTE. at their previous Meeting, of the continuance orQuestion of otherwise of sanctions on Italy.Sanctions .Shortly before the Meeting the Secretary of(previous State for Foreign Affairs had circulated a reference:Cabinet 39 Despatch to Sir E. Drummond (Rome), No,674, giving(36) ,  Con-clusion 8.) an account of a conversation he had held with theF.p..i-hi(y^)i.      Italian Ambassador on May 28th, in the course ofwhich the Ambassador had indicated that signor mussolini was sincerely desirous of bringing about an improvement in Anglo-Italian relations .The Secretary of State for Foreign .Affairs,adding to the Despatch, said that when talkingof sanctions the Italian Ambassador had notconcealed that they had had some effect in Italy.As regards the French position, the french ambassador had indicated, that the new FrenchGovernment had not made up their mind, as yet onthe question of withdrawing sanctions, and probablywould, not have done so by the middle of June, whenthe Council of the League was to meet.    Consequentlywe could not look for much help or guidance in that direction.    /Vhen Signor Grandi had. been speaking ofthe fact, that both ends of the Mediterranean werein British hands, he himself had. felt instinctivelythat  Italy had some views as to the Eastern enr1 ofthe Mediterranean.In reply to a question as to what we could,^expect to obtain from sanctions if they were maintained and. were reasonably successful   in a word, what would, be our aim in keeping them on  -the Secretary of State said, we should desire adeclaration from Italy that they would, not raise a black Army;    that they would maintain the
&quot;open door&quot;*    and respect their obligations in thefuture.    If such a declaration were made to theLeague it would be useful.    Geneva, he gathered,would not want to bargain on the subject, but if italy were to offer such a declaration the situation would be easier.    He agreed, that it was not practi-cable, by the maintenance of sanctions, to ensurethe withdrawal of Italy from Abyssinia.The Prime Minister asked if there were reallyany chance of a &quot;deal&quot; between Signor Mussolini andthe League of Nations.   Would, it not be advisable for us to approach Signor Mussolini beforehand,with a view to securing such a declaration?    In his view that, ought to be done.The Lord Privy Seal said, that the prospectdepended, to a great extent on how the question washandled, with Signor Mussolini.    If the Council ofthe League were to say that they would not raisesanctions unless certain declarations were made, theoutlook would, be hopeless.   After listening to thediscussion at the Cabinet on May 27th he had. searchedfor some plain alternatives on which the cabinet could, decide.    For a short time he had thought thatthe alternatives lay between raising sanctions and what he called, the &quot;Red Sea policy&quot;.    Thehoweveralternatives/were not so simple as that.   He imagined,however, that every member of the Cabinet agreed,for a number of reasons   e.g., the future ofEurope, the position of the Defence Services,trade, etc.  in the desire to raise sanctions atthe earliest possible moment.   At the same time,       .flo few-       f^nu^M^-however, it was necessary to avoid, any damage to      .
Also we ought to get something in return, if wecould.    Sir Eric Drummond.&apos;s Despatch,.the despatch from the Consul at Naples, Sir Sidney Barton&apos;sDespatches, and the Conversations with SignorGrand!, even, all indicated, that sanctions were having a considerable effect .    If they were notraised, this alone woul^ produce a psychological effect in Italy.   He had received letters fromfriends in Italy from which he gathered, that therewas considerable glamour owing to the Italianvictories, but accompanied by a strong hope thatthe result would be the withdrawal of sanctions .If, then, sanctions were maintained, it would, bringabout a reaction.    In this country if sanctions were taken off there would, be a severe shock to publicopinion.   T-?e had. listened with interest to thereport of the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs as to the views of the Dominions.   He himself had had an informal conversation with the T-Tigh Commis-sioner for Canada, who thought that the reaction in Canada and the United States to a withdrawal of sanctions would be comparable to that of the Hoare-Laval agreement.    It was clear also that any ideaof holding on to sanctions merely in order tovindicate the League would, be the height of folly .His idea, therefore, would be to keep signor mussolini guessing for a time.    Signor Grand i&apos; sovertures rather supported him in this view .He would like, therefore, to give time for thefollowing factors to operate, namely, the Frenchdesire to liquidate the situation and the depressionwhich was likely to afflict Signor Mussolini fromthe decline of his economic situation.    vVe couldnot expect to get very much out e*f any approach,
and co he would not he at all precise as to what was required of Signor Mussolini:    in fact he would avoidmelodramatic action:    go as slow as possible;    he asunprovocative as possible;    and conduct most of thebusiness behind the scenes.     At Geneva, his linewould be (l) that we contemplated a stock-talcingof the position at the League and perhaps areconstruction;    and (2) while the League must take note of the situation as it exists - and therewas no useful purpose to be gained by ignoring the realities of the situation - we had no desire tomaintain sanctions for punitive purposes and were anxious for friendly relations.     Yet, unless wewere to turn our backs on the whole conception ofthe League, it was impossible for the League merely to disinterest itself and raise sanctions at a timewhen Signor Mussolini had ignored the League and given it no indication of his future intentions.In a word, he would make no proposals to signor mussolini at this stage and would take the line thatthis was impossible until he had made his attitudeclearer.The Secretary of State for Air said his mind had been considerably clarified by thestatement by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs at the previous Meeting.     He wished to escape from our present position with the least possible discredit for the League and for ourselves.A principal object of our policy should be to avoidItaly combining with Germany.     We had wanted to
prevent the Italian aggression from succeeding.)In that v/e had failed.     The best terms that Italy-could now accept v/ould be worse for the Leaguethan the Hoare-Laval agreement.     The League wouldbe more discredited by endorsing them them byadmitting the failure apparent to all in its main objective.      The time factor was vital inEurope.     Herr Hitler was awaiting the Junedecision of the League.     Signor Mussolini would beless amenable if further estranged.     SignerMussolini&apos;s desires would be great even ifsanctions were removed.     He would incur greatexpenditure and would be able to get no credit.His people would know that the difficulties were of his own making and that the blame could not beput on sanctions.     Consequently, signor mussolini was likely to be more reasonable ifsanctions were removed.     As long as sanctionswere maintained, it would be difficult to dealwith League reform.     On the whole, he thought itless disadvantageous to the League and more advantageous to us to raise sanctions.     He would,however, like to act in this matter with theFrench Government.     He recalled M. Leger&apos;sstatement as to the probable desire of the FrenchGovernment to raise sanctions and to collaborate with ourselves.     Could we not say to the French that it was really impossible for them to leave uswithout any idea of what their attitude would bebefore the Meeting of June 16th, and try and reach some agreement with them?
The Lord Chancellor agreed generally  with the Secretary of State for Air.He wished the sanctions to he removed assoon as possible.     He rather doubted theanticipations as to the effect of continuingsanctions on Signor Mussolini.     As the war had shown, estimates of economic experts wereapt to work out more slowly than theyanticipated.     Were sanctions kept on therewould be the danger of their petering out.The Cabinet should remember the difficulty of keeping our Imperial forces locked up for so longin the Eastern Mediterranean, which meant that the pressure and inconvenience of sanctions on ourselves were very great.     he agreed that public opinion would be shocked if wewere to announce the removal of sanctions.That would apply not only to extremists but tomany moderate people who had been shocked bythe Italian use of gas.      The key of theposition appeared to be the handling of theFrench.     He would like at Geneva to be ina position to say that we would have been willing to keep on sanctions but would accede to the French wish to remove them.     Handledproperly he thought it might be possible toindnce the French to take a lead.     a proper way appeared to be to put into their
minds, first, that we were prepared to keepsanctions on unless they asked, us to raise them:and, second, the grave danger of a Hitler-Mussolinirapprochement/,    &quot;&quot;hey might then he willing to propose a removal of sanctions, and. we should support them.    Whenever sanctions were removed,there was hound, to he some outcry and. loss of prestige.   He would, try and. counter-ha lance theloss of jjrestige by preparing a scheme for theamendment of the League of Nations so that at the september Meeting we could take the lead, in areconstruction of the League .The Minister for Co-ordination of defence agreed with the Secretary of State for Air and.the Lord Chancellor.   He was trying to look beyondthe immediate question.    The important thing was toprevent Herr Hitler and. Signor Mussolini fromcoming together.   To continue sanctions would, beto perpetuate our difficulties in the eastern mediterranean.    It would, expose us also to apossible conflict with Germany, a possible warwith Italy, and. possibly &apos; who could foretell?)might be .     .with Japan.    This \j    a pessimistic view. Sanctions,however, were not, in his view, likely to succeed.in bringing Signor Mussolini to make terms withthe League at an early date .    If they did. bring himto that position it was by no means certain that hewould give in.   He might well engage in some furtheradventure, using his forces in Africa for thispurpose.   He himself was anxious to get rid ofour commitments in Eastern Europe.   He would, like,therefore, to give up sanctions as soon as possible and. to see our commitments to the League of Nationsamended.   mo do that woul-1 be to throw the Dictatorsapart.   Herr Hitler would, have his eye on Austria,-11-
and. this must react on Signor Mussolini and. easeour own situation in the Mediterranean.   FromSignor Grandi&apos;s interview he gathered, that Italy&apos;sidea was to get us to join in an encirclement ofGermany, involving us in a part of the world. wrherewe had no interest.    The important thing was to liquidate our commitments in Eastern Europe, bywhich he meant the Balkans and. the Eastern Med.it-mediterranean.    So long as sanctions were maintainedwe had to keep our guard, in the Mediterranean, andwe had not the resources to continue that indefinite-ly.    It was essential, from the point of view of theServices, to get out of it as soon as possible.This would put us in a position to return to  what had. for a time been discredited but was now tending to come back   the balance of power in Europe.    That balance would, lie between herr hitler and. Signor Mussolini over Austria.    Thequestion of the method, of giving up sanctions hewould, leave to others .   There were many methods .       &apos; &apos;We might  try to get France to take some responsi-bility .    The effect on public opinion must not be over-rated.   mhe essential matter for the nationwas to get this commitment liquidated., to returnto our commitment over Locarno and. Western Europe,and. to get quit of Eastern Europe .   He would, not make a bargain with Signor Mussolini, but,without  going as far as that, would, urge thewithdrawal of sanctions.
The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriespointed out that it was impossible to dissociateourselves from the Eastern Mediterranean.     Hecompared that course with the attitude of the supporters of the Western Front theory in the War.      In Africa,it so happened that the interests of the League andof this country coincided.      The late Lord Salisbury&apos;speaceful settlement of Africa ought to be maintained.It was very desirable that Africa should bedemilitarised as far as possible and open to trade.The African situation which included freedom^ for tradein vast areas was one of the great achievements of the nineteenth century.     Eventually, it would have to beconsidered in relation to the German demand for colonies.      In these circumstances, our position in theEastern Mediterranean and the Suez Canal was a vitalBritish interest and we must be able to concentrateconsiderable forces there.     We could not disinterestourselves.      It would be a mistake in these circumstances to raise sanctions now.      There was no danger of theirpetering out.     As Chairman of the Committee which hadinvestigated sanctions, he had no doubt that so long asthe United Kingdom and France held together, they would remain effective.      Their removal,  therefore, depended on France.      The sanctions card possessed considerable importance in the game, owing to the interest of theUnited Kingdom in the Mediterranean and the Africanposition.     Consequently, he supported the view expressedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the previous meeting.The Minister for the Co-Ordination ofDefence, in order to clear up his position, explained that
if sanctions were withdrawn Signor Mussolini wouldhave to watch Herr Hitler over Austria., and thiswould immensely lighten our task of maintaining our position in the Eastern Mediterranean.(The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsentered about this point.)The Secretary of State for War said hehad been struck by the large amount of unanimityin the Cabinet on this question.     Everyone wishedto take off sanctions as soon as possible.     It was generally recognised that they must come off at thelatest in September and at the earliest in June.In the interval, was it best to irritate or to conciliate Signor Mussolini?      Surely the second course was the better.     There was no time to lose.      It willbe easier now than later.      He was in favour ofworking as much as possible behind the scenes.He agreed with the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence that it was essential to get rid of our commitments in the Eastern Mediterranean.      This couldonly be done by an arrangement under which we couldwork with Italy.The Minister of Health agreed generally with the Lord Privy Seal.      He thought it would be afoolish thing to throw array the card of sanctions atthe present time without any return.     Ho thoLightalso that it should not be difficult to get the declarations which the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs wanted.      His policy, therefore, would beto  try and get something in return for the abandonment of sanctions.
The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs was prepared to maintain sanctions if better termscould thereby be obtained for Abyssinia or suchundertakings as the non-arming of black troops, but he did not know how effective sanctions were or how longthey must be maintained to produce an effect.     Toabandon them now would be to affect our prestige inthis country, and in the Dominions and throughout Africa as wellas the prestige of the League but, if sanctions were merely going to peter out, he maintained the effect would be even more serious.      If that was to beexpected, the longer sanctions were to be continued,the more we should suffer ourselves unless we had theconfidence that sanctions would produce some result.He thought the proper course would be to encouragePrance to take the lead       removing them if possible,and ourselves to make clear that we had done our best to make sanctions a success and were removing thembecause they had resulted in a failure - a failure dueto the incompleteness of the League itself.     He would add that we were going to do our best to make the Leagueas effective an instrument as possible.     He attachedconsiderable importance to &quot;the declarations suggested bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the previous meeting.      In brief, unless sanctions continued for afew months longer and were likely to prove effective,he thought that we should discard them.
The President of the Board of Education pointedout that, bad as would be the effect on publicopinion of withdrawing sanctions, the result would be even worse if there were a bargain whichgained nothing for Abyssinia.    Consequently, between now and June 16th he would like to follow up signor mussolini&apos;s olive-branch and try and. get the Duceto make a spontaneous declaration as to the non-useof black troops, and so forth.   At the same time we should try and. get Prance to take the lead.Above all, however, we should, avoid any suggestion of a bargain, and give as the only reason forwithdrawing sanctions that they had. failed..   Evenif Signor Mussolini did. not. make a. declarationbefore June 16th he would still withdraw sanctions.The Minister of Agriculture and. Fisheriesdemurred, to the idea of throwing up the sponge justat the moment when success was near.    This would be-to repeat a mistake made by the Emperor of Abyssinia.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said it had never been in his mind to present the settlement as a bargain, but merely to continue talks behind.the scenes, following up Signor Orandi&apos; s interviewand what he had. said, as to black troops, the &quot;opendoor&quot;, etc.   He would let the Italian Ambassadorknow that,  like Signor Mussolini, we should liketo put. an end. to the feud and. that we should, notbe too exiseant.    lie should, however, like signor mussolini to repeat so..:e of the statements he had.made to a more responsble audience than thejournalists to whom he had addressed, them.He would, indicate that we were anxious to clear up the situation as soon as possible, but thatit. would, not be right for us to  make the first, move.-15-
We should ask for Signor Mussolini to make knownhis general ideas as to the future administrationof Abyssinia and the other matters he had mentioned.This could then be presented, not as a bargain, butas a contribution towards a settlement.The President of the Board, of Education pointedout the importance of the time factor.    The vitalpoint was that any declaration vy Signor Mussolinishould be made before, and. not after, the 16th June.Any approach to him should, therefore be as early aspossible .The Prime Minister said this was one of the most difficult questions the Cabinet had had. to decide,and. he shared, the views of many of his colleagues .It was a case where there was every reason for taking off sanctions.    Keeping them on was not likely to have any effect on Signor Mussoliniexcept to make matters worse.   The difficulty wasone of face-saving and public opinion in thiscountry, the United States, Canada,  etc.   american public opinion was a peculiar thing, - never helpful,always critical.    Public opinion here was moreimportant.    The Government in Prance today wasin a position similar to that which would confronta Socialist Government, taking office with littleexperience and. a difficult situation to deal with.The result was that they had. not a mind on thesematters, and. the Foreign Secretary would, probablyget little help from them.    If we were to insist on maintaining sanctions with lukewarm Frenchsupport, the situation might become very dangerous.He could not see an end. to it, and. the end. might bean unhappy one.   He thought, therefore, that weshould, utilise the coming week to the utmost in-17-
conversations with (a) Prance, and rb)  Italy.    Ifthe French could, not make up their minds, let usknow at least where they were trending.    SignorGrandi had given indications of the italian attitude on such matters as black troops:    makingno difficulties for us in Egypt, Palestine and theSudan?    African peace;    and so forth.   Abyssinia was lost beyond recovery.    Could we not get signor mussolini to give assurances either to the Leagueof Nations or to France and ourselves?    That wouldease the situation considerably.    If sanctions wereto drift on without a term to them he could see noend..    They were a great expense;    they involvedkeeping large forces in the Mediterranean at greatinconvenience;    they kept Europe on the qui vive;prevented progress with European peace;    and increased the difficulties of our own Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence.    It would be an immense relief to get our forces back from theMediterranean.   He would like to hear from theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs the prospects of obtaining something definite as to the attitudeof France and Italy, and how he envisaged thesituation if sanctions were maintained.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairspromised, to circulate a Memorandum on the probable effect of maintaining sanctions.    Broadly, the viewof the Foreign Office was that they would producesome effect but no decisive result for some time-As to Italy&apos;s good will, he thought that signor mussolini&apos;s approach was genuine and that he wanted a ddtente...   He had no confidence in its durationonce it ha^ ceased, to suit Signor Mussolini.    vVeshould have to keep a watchful eye on Italy for a
As to thebarlong time to come.   What Signor Mussolini needed mostwas money, and he hoped, that we should, not give ithim.   As to League reconstruction, he hoped that decisions could he reached and. discussed, with theDominions in time for an announcement to he made before the end of July   though this, as the PrimeMinister reminded the Cabinet, was a matter underconsideration by the Cabinet Committee.German position he was increasingly preoccupied.T-Te was about to circulate a. Despatch from TTis Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin reporting an interview between mr Kennedy, who had. gone as Special Correspondent of&quot;The Times&quot; and. had ^een very pro-German, and Dr.Schacht.   &quot;&quot;he latter was demanding easier access toraw materials for Germany and had intimated, that ifthey did not get them Germany would  explode:    that isto say, would go to war.     Meanwhile the german economic situation v.-as getting steadily worse.As to sanctions he was uneasy at the proposal to follow up his interview with Signor Grand!.    -Te understoodthat he was asked, to tell Signor Grandi that what he had said was very interesting but would be more so if it were repeated to the League of Nations .    If hedi^ this he taking the first step into a, negotia-tion with the Italian Ambassador which he did. not want,since the real dispute was between Italy and theLeague.    To talk with the Ambassador w-ots^H be to lead us into a false position.    Consequently he didnot like the proposal.As regards, the French he would, like to say tothem that b^e-^e^re June 16th we did not intend, to propose or join in proposing the removal of sanctions,^e woul^ add. that in our view the removal of sanctionson June 16th was premature, first, because the situationin Abyssinia was far from clear and the Italians had-19-
21) 2occupied little more^esf the country V   and, second,because a decision of this magnitude, which affected the very existence of the League, ought to be taken bythe Assembly as a whole in September.    On this he would ask the French for their views.    Tf they disagreed,then he would say that we were prepared to agree to aproposal to raise sanctions.    Bat in our statement tothe Council he would repeat that the League shouldreaffirm its condemnation of Italian action, and we ourselves should, make a declaration in some form inrespect, of the mutual relations of those MediterraneanPowers who had. taken part in imposing sanctions *   Hewould, also like to make clear our view that stock-takingwould he necessary by the League bofo^e September, andwarn the French that this stock-taking could, not resultin increasing our commitments under the Covenant.Further, he would like to tell the French that we werenot going to join them in making representations to rome, and. would add. that our action must be collectiveand. that any views to be expressed, on June 16th would depend on collective action.The Minister of Health pointed, out that  if thiscourse were adopted it was most likely that sanctions would, be maintained on June 16th.The Chancellor of the Exchequer understood thatthe idea of the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs was to make no preparations before June 16th, but, if France assented, to announce then that it was premature to remove the sanctions.    Other nations, not having beenprepared,, would assume that this meant an indefinitecontinuance of sanctions.    Some might well say thatthey would, not continue them.   He himself had hopedthat in the interval the ground, would be explored asfar as possible \    that we would say at Geneva that we
could not remove sanctions without certain assurances from Signor Mussolini.   We- could, say that with themore confidence if we had. ascertained that he was willing to give the assurances.  &apos;He had. thought alsothat some further exploration might be made .    Itwould, be possible to say to Signor Grandi that weappreciated his friendly remarks:    that we did not wish to maintain the feud:    but that we might be ableto come to some arrangement if it did. not create too great a shock for public opinion.    We might ask, forexample, whether signor Mussolini would, be prepared,to say to the League the things that he had already said, to newspaper correspondents.    The FrenchGovernment would undoubtedly be delighted if this could be arranged.    If no assurances could, be obtained,from Signor Mussolini a new situation would have arisen, w)uich he would lik^e to,, consider again. (The Prime Minister said, that fina.1 decisions were not being taken that day.The Minister of Health supported, the idea ofexploration, as suggested, by the Chancellor of theExchequer.desired su..h exploration, though he had no greatconfidence in the result.    there was not the slightestneed, to bargain-line was to tell Signor Grandi (who very likely himself would, ask for a further interview) that it was one thing to talk to newspapers an&apos; another thing to talk to the League.   Possibly, however, signor mussolini would be willing to make a pronouncementto the public opinion of the world..The Secretary of State for Air agreed, and pointed out that if Signor Mussolini made anThe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence alsoThe Home Secretary suggested that the proper
announcement to the League and sanctions were removed.,it would, look like a bargain:    but  if he said it tothe world, that would not be so marked.The Home Secretary pointed out also that astatement by paron Aloisi at Geneva, which would be ofa cautious nature, would not have the same effect asa public statement by Signor Mussolini.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he would prefer a statement in reply to the League of Nations,but, if that could not be secured, would content himself with a public statement.The Secretary o^ State for Foreign Affairsdoubted whether he could do this without being drawn into a negotiation and taking on ourselves what was really a League of Nations responsibility.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed, outthat it would only really be taking a sounding andnot making a bargain.The Prime Minister added that the stakes wereenormous .mhe Home Secretary, adverting to some remarksmade earlier on the reform of the League of Nations,pointed out that the important question would be asto whether boundaries of nations were to be guaranteedor not ,    From Signor Grandi&apos;s mention of Italy asbeing now one of the &quot;satisfied.&quot; Powers, this seemed,to indicate that now he intended to stand for theexisting, situation as desired, by the French.The Prime Minister said that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs had. better see Signor Grandi.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs agreed, to see the Italian Ambassador.-32-

c0/iL MINES6.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that he had informed the Cabinet that he was in aposition to approach the owners of coal royaltiesconsidering how this was affected by the decisionto introduce a new Bill.     Many of the colliery owners were also royalty owners and there was a danger that they might try and get better terms inrespect of royalties in return for promising   support to the Bill.     That was an argument for delayingthese negotiations.     On the other hand, if they weredelayed until the Autumn when the Bill Was to beintroduced,  the rates of interest might rise and thiswould increase the cost of buying  out royalties.     ,0nthe whole, therefore, he favoured going on with thenegotiations after Whitsuntide.immediately after Whitsuntide, and he had beenThe Cabinet agreed to this course.2, Whitehall gardens.W.I.29th April, 1936.
...        . Offices of the Cabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens,S . iv .1 *S E C R E T.29th May,  1936.Dear Mr, Norman,In the absence of the Postmaster-General,who is away from London to-day, the Prime Minister has instructed me to address you on the following matter.The Cabinet this morning had their attentioncalled to an item in the Hews Bulletin of the british broadcasting Corporation last Wednesday night to theeffect that the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday morningwas understood to have had before it the Report of theTribunal which has been investigating the alleged Budgetleakage, and that this Report was then considered by theCabinet. I am instructed to write to you about this,for inasmuch as Cabinet meetings are secret and theproceedings at them are known to none but members ofthe Cabinet, such an announcement, in the absence ofexpress authorisation, must represent either a leakageor an invention.       It is,of course, appreciated that thestatement was not a positive assertion but was introduced by the phrase &quot;It is understood&quot;, but I am sure you will appreciate that the great majority of hearers cannot beexpected to draw these fine distinctions, and in fact theimpression produced is that a piece of news about what passed at the .Cabinet meeting is being conveyed.I am to say that the Government are boundto take a serious view of statements in an item of newsbroadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation as towhat is supposed to have passed in the secrecy of a cabinet meeting, and they feel confident thatthenBritish broadcasting corporation will agree that the mere fact that a number ofanonymous journalists publish statements to the same effect is no reason for giving it the added authority of
circulation thus involved. In fact there wasnot a syllable of truth in the statement, hut theprinciple does not depend on that. I am tosuggest, as a precaution against the repetition of suchan incident, that the rule should he definitely laiddown that no reference should he made in the News Bulletto what is supposed to have been passed at a cabinet meeting, unless special and direct authority for thestatement has been obtained by the British broadcasting corporation from No. 10 Downing Street.       The PrimeMinister will be glad to hear from you that thissuggestion has been adopted and will be put into forcehenceforward.Yours sincerely,(Sgnd). M.P.A.
