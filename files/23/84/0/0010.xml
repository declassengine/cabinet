IfpTAL OF PEERSg^ERS.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(56Conclusion 81.     The Lord Chancellor reported that the Houseof Lords had passed Lord sankey&apos;s Bill entitled the trial of Peers (Abolition of Privileges) Bill, theeffect of which was to abolish privileges of Peersto be tried by the House of Lords,The Cabinet agreed:That Government support should begiven to the Bill in the House ofCommons.
POLICY.:ttle subsidy:&quot;eviouselusion 5).2. The Prime Minister reported that theChancellor of the Exchequer, as Chairman of theCabinet Committee on Trade and Agriculture, had reported that the work of the Committee and thenegotiations with the Dominions and theArgentine Republic about meat were held up by a deadlock-between the Chancellor on the one hand and theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland on the otherhand on the question of the amount of subsidy to bepaid to the home producers of fat cattle.As the issues involved are largely of apolitical character the Chancellor of theExchequer, with the concurrence of the other two ministers, had suggested that some body should review them and make a report which would enablethe Cabinet to reach a decision.On the suggestion of the Prime minister the Cabinet agreed:That the issue should be remitted to a Committee composed as follows:-The Lord Chancellor (in the Chair).The Home Secretary.The Minister of Health.The Parliamentary Under Secretaryof State. Foreign Offioe,(Lord Stanhope).Note;      It was arranged that thisCommittee should meet in theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;room at the Treasury on Thursday28th May, at 10 a.m. for a preliminary meeting of one hour&apos;s duration -some members of the Committee havingother appointments after 11.0 a.m.
rpTTTj coronation oath.previous reference :Cabinet 3 6(-36) , Con-conclusion 1.)3,      The Cabinet had before them, a Joint Memorandumby the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forDominion Affaire (CP .-147 (36)) pointing out that theGovernment of the Union of South Africa had. raised, byan official communication from the High commissioner to the Dominions Office, the question of the form ofthe Coronation Oath.    In the view of the Union Govern-ment the traditional form of the Coronation Ceremonytook account merely of the realm of the United. Kingdom,and they were of opinion that as the Ceremony was onewhich concerned all the Members of the Commonwealth andnot merely one of them, the Oath should, be so amended as to take a collective form, as suggested, in Annexure&quot;A.&quot; to the High Commissioners letter.    The Governmentof the Union contemplated dealing with the matter inan Act of Parliament, a draft of which was attached inAnnexure &quot;B&quot; .The Memorandum stated, that as the result of inter-departmental discussion the conclusion had been reached that the form o^ the Oath used, at the Coronation of king George V in 1911 was not wholly in accord with theconstitutional position resulting from the ImperialConference of 1926 and. the Statute of Westminster, 1931,and. that some modification was desirable.    The Attorney-General had. advised, that a suitable amendment could bemade without express legislation for the purpose, andthat it would be appropriate that the first part of the oath should be amended so as to substitute the words:-&quot;peoples of this United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and. Northern Ireland,of Your Dominions, of Your Possessionsbeyond, the Seas, and. of India, accordingto the respective laws and. customs ofthe same&quot;*
The Home Secretary,  the Lord President ofthe Council and the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs gave explanations as to the present positionin regard to Loth the Coronation Oath and the preparations for the Coronation.In the course of the discussion, a view which met with strong support was that it was important to bring the Dominions as closely as possible into the coronation Ceremony.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor^Gencralshould bo ashed to prepare a writtenOpinion on.the question (on which theAttorne3&apos;--General has already advised)as to whether the proposed alteration in the Coronation Oath can be made without express legislation.     Suchan opinion could, if thought desirable or necessary, be communicated to theDominion Governments.(b) That copies of CP. 147 (36), togetherwith the Appendices (including moreparticularly the Attorney-General1smemorandum in Appendix IV&quot;) should besent to the Attorney-General andSolicitor-General.(c) That a Cabinet Committee should be setLip to consider both the coronation oath (in the light of the Opinion ofthe Lord Chancellor and the LawOfficers of the Crown) and theconstitutional and other questions arising in connection with theassociation of the Dominions in theCorona.tion Ceremony.(d) That the Lord President of the council should advise the Prime Minister asto the composition and terms ofreference of the Cabinet Committeewhich would be settled or taken note of at the next regular weekly meetingof the Cabinet.(e) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, before the Coronation Councilto be held on the morrow, should seethe High Commissioners of theDominions in London (or at least the High Commissioner of South Africa)and inform them that the .setting up
of the Coronation Committee by the coronation Council would not be theonly answer to the South AfricanHigh Commissioner&apos;s letter, whichwould not be prejudiced thereby.
LITANY AND THEfeT^O. TREATY.previous reference:Cabinet 38(36)Conclusion 2)The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported to the Cabinet that after consultationwith some of his Cabinet colleagues, he had completed and sent to Germany the despatch whichhe had been instructed to prepare at the meeting-referred to in the margin.     He expressed histhanks to his colleagues who had assisted him and,more particularly, to the Lord President of theCouncil who had made a number of valuablesuggestions which he had adopted.     He had not yet received any reply from Berlin and it was reportedthat the German Foreign Secretary had gone away fora holiday.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsalso informed the Cabinet that a well-knownAmerican journalist had just returned from a tour ofGermany and reported that everywhere theAmerican Consuls took a gloomy view of the prospects of neace.
ANGLO -GERMANIfeviousInference: IiDinet (^)^elusion ^ ^,5.     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the German Government was anxious to vary an understanding which had been reached and putinto writing coincidently with the Anglo-german naval Agreement under which Germany agreed toFR-lrzfa)11. accept three 8-inch cruisers instead of five to which she was entitled,     Germany was now asking for five8-inch cruisers instead of three, one of thereasons for this demand being the Franco-soviet treaty,The First Lord of the Admiralty said thatif Germany maintained this demand the position wouldbe very serious as, on the basis of the understandingreferred to,   he had been able to bring about the cruiser holiday which was one of the most importantparts of the Naval Treats?.     German insistence intheir new demand might involve scrapping this partof the Treaty and possibly even the whole.     Therehad, however, been difficulties before inconnection with the Naval Treaty and he hoped thatthese might again be overcome.The Cabinet took note that Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the First Lord of theAdmiralty were in contact on the subject and wouldtake the matter up with the German Government.
proposed Visit bytrie Prime Minister.6.     The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs reported that the Belgian ambassador had intimated to him that M. van Zeeland, theBelgian Prime Minister, would like to come toLondon shortly after Whitsuntide to confer withhim.The Cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have discretion to give an affirmative answer toM. van Zeeland&apos;s suggestion.
ANGLO-EGYPT IANTREATY NEGO-TIATTONS .(previous reference:Cabinet 3 8(36). Con-elusion 3 *)FR. J+-o 7.     The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (C.P.-145 (36))giving an account of an interview that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and himself had had with representatives of the Dominions chiefly inter-ested in the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty negotiations ,The two Ministers were satisfied, that the Dominionsrepresentatives who attended were in agreement withthe present proposals and that their influence ontheir several Governments would, be exercised, to gainthose Governments&apos;   support.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he had heard from the British High Commissionerthat Nahas Pasha had taken the Government&apos;sproposals for an Egyptian settlement badly andthere was every probability of a breakdown of thepresent negotiations.     Sir Miles Lampson had askedfor instructions to be sent him before the 3rd Junebut he ha^-repM-ed that this was impossible.     Oneidea that he had in mind was to adjourn thenegotiations until the Autumn.      AlthoughSir Miles Lampson had reported that the effect of ourlu test proposal was very bad, he was still waiting withhis detailed observations.     If\a breakdown wereto take place^t any rate   the case was a good one from the point of view of public opinion here.In the course of a short discussion, theview was expressed that any breakdown in negotiations should, if possible, be postponed until the situation was in hand in Palestine where, for the moment, theArab leaders had lost control.
The Cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should instruct sir Miles Lampson to ask for a shortadjournment and to return home toLondon for consultation as soon astjoss ible,
rptrp; ITALO- 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsABYSSINIANDISPUTE. said that he had not circulated a Memorandum as heQuestion of thought it would be more useful if, before doing so,Sanctions.a general discussion took place at the Cabinet on(Previous the question of whether sanctions on Italy should reference:Cabinet 38        be raised or not.(36), Con-clusion The issue before the Cabinet w&amp;s necessarilya choice of evils, and this had really been thecase since December last.    There were two mainalternatives, namely:-(l) To raise sanctions:(2)  To continue them;though there were variations of, and embellishmentsto, either course.In favour of raising sanctions it could be saidthat they had been approved for a certain purpose,namely, to bring the war to an end.   As they had failed in their purpose, they should be taken Off.In addition, it could be argued that the militarycampaign was over and there was therefore no reasonfor continuing sanctions.    Another argument wasthat Italy would thereby be brought back to theLeague of Nations and that, the risk of a german attack on Austria, would be reduced .    Further,  that signor Mussolini, after sanctions had been raised,would be less likely to come to terms with herr hitler and that the situation in the Mediterraneanwould be eased.    it would render Anglo-french -operation easier, and facilitate the approaches to Germany.Against the raising of sanctions it could besaid.&quot; that this would tend to emphasise the failureof the League and. our own loss of prestige .
His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome, though in favourof raising sanctions, had given warning that itwould be hailed as a triumph in Italy and. that any improvement in Anglo-Italian relations thereforewould, not be rapid.    The raising of sanctions also would have some effect on Herr Hitler. - In the pasthe had. not. been pro-Italian, but might not this ,make him more favourable to Italy?   Me*eev^er, ifSignor Mussolini was embarrassed by the retentionof sanctions, would not Herr Hitler be encouraged.thereby to make trouble in Austria?   Another reasonagainst raising sanctions was that there would, be aconsiderable shock to Eritish public opinion,     - -which at the present, moment would/^u unwclwme.It had to be remembered that many people thoughtthat the new French Government would adopt adifferent attitude from its predecessors onsanctions,   He himself did not altogether sharethis view.    If we were to declare ourselves infavour of raising sanctions the French Governmentwould, no doubt agree and. be very relieved?    butthey might very probably declare that if we had.adopted, another course they would have been willingto maintain them.   Many people in England, would.think this true .The Secretary of State then mentioned certain suggestions that had been made for concomitantaction if sanctions were raised:-(l) That the condemnation of Italy should,be maintained, by the League  the result might be that  Italy would leave the League of Nations(S) That the League should refuse torecognise the results of the aggression   This was very difficult for Prance and ourselves, who wereclose neighbours of Abyssinia.-12-
(3) The expulsion of Italy from theLeague   The difficulty was thatone&quot;nation at Geneva could stopit.(4) That the League should announcean intention to re-examine its constitution.(5) ^o couple with the withdrawal of sanctions either an announcementof a Mediterranean Pact or of-a- .....declaration of our intention to fulfil our obligations underArticle IS,Para,3, of the Covenant,in order to demonstrate that whatever happened, in the Mediterraneanwas of vital importance to us.In favour of maintaining sanctions the Secretary  \of State said this would, be possible if whole-hearted co-operaA ion from Prance could&quot; be relied, on.He himself was doubtful of this, but it would be a difficult matter on which to convince public opinion.The purpose of maintaining sanctions would be toshow a continuous respect for international law,though the immediate object, would be to maintainthem until Italy was willing to come to Geneva todiscuss a permanent settlement and. to recognise theauthority of the League .   Prom our own point of view the important point was to elucidate the intentions of the Italian Government in regard, to the League ofNations and. their various engagements, and. moreparticularly to obtain from them a declaration aboutth^n^^tJoin&quot;black tr-troops and forwarding reports tothe Lea.gue of Nations in regard, to Abyssinia.    Ifsanctions were retained. Prance would, be able to approach Signor Mussolini and. ask for some declara.-tion.    In that way something might be saved from thewreckage.   He was impressed, with the dangers&apos; forthe future ip Italy escaped, from all the consequences of her action on June 16th.    This would prejudicefuture negotiations with Italy on many points,
His own strong inclination, if a good reason could,be found, was not to raise sanctions, which he believed, were producing considerable effect in increasing the Italian depression and signor mussolini&apos;s difficulties.   He admitted, that therewas a risk of other nations dropping out, but thiswas not very great so long as Prance and, ourselvesstood together.The President of the Board of Trade added, tothe Secretary of State&apos;s appreciation that Britishtraders were sustaining considerable losses owingto the continuance of sanctions, without receivingany compensation.    Irreparable harm to our interests had. already been done, and traders were anxious to know how long sanctions were to becontinued, as there was not the least chance oftheir making arrangements for an eventual recovery of their trade until sanctions came to an end.Losses were going to mount up to a very serioustotal if sanctions could not be got out of the way.In this connection the Cabinet were reminded,however, that Italy&apos;s financial position was now sobad that even if sanctions were removed, it wouldbe a long time before payments could be made for purchases in this country.The Cabinet were also reminded, that sanctionsmust come to an end. sooner or later.    Tie worstthing that could, happen to the League was thats anctions should, be allowed, to peter out, for inthat event they could never be imposed, again.Why, it was asked, should, we not await a lead.from the French Government, in this matter?If sanctions were to be dropped, then it would bewell to take advantage Of the olive-branch recently-14-
held oat by Signor Mussolini and to obtain as muchgood will as possible in order to clear up thesituation in the Mediterranean.    Our main object,it was suggested, should be to prevent the Europeandictators from coming together.    There were .two alternatives:    either Signor Mussolini might refuseto give any guarantees, or he might give certainassurances.    The latter alternative was, perhaps,the worst from the point of view of public opinion,because it would mean that the League had recognised the results of an aggression.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that the Australian HighCommissioner was in favour o^ taking off sanctions,accompanying with it a series of declarations on&apos; the lines mentioned by the Foreign Secretary./with Mr Bruce, but did not know the views of hisGovernment .    The New Zealand High Commissioner also agreed personally, but stated that his government at present favoured the retention of sanctions.He thought, however, that they would probably agreewith the line taken by the Home Government *    TheSouth African High Commissioner felt strongly thats anctions shoul&quot;1 be maintained.    He and his Govern -ment were persuad.ed that in course of time the&apos;sanctions would be successful and that signor mussolini would be compelled to negotiate.   TheIrish Free State High Commissioner personally agreed with the South Africa.n T-Tigh Commissioner, and had added, that Mr de Valera was in favour of theretention of sanctions unless they involved a^riskof a European war . Tiie Secretary of State was tomeet the High Commissioners again, and had. asked the High Commissioner of Cana.da personally agreed
that in the meanwhile they should, ascertain theviews of their respective Governments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer held, the viewthat Signor Mussolini would probably respond, if weoffered to raise sanctions and come to terms, andthat he might be very ready to co-operate again with france and. ourselves in Europe,    The advantage ofthis would be counteracted by the loss of public support in this country,    The Italians had behaved,so badly that it would be impossible morally and,indeed, almost indecent to come to terms with them.tAlthough we were not ina position to punish Italywe ought, not to give up sanctions without gettingsomething in return.   Without actually putting signor mussolini in a position where he would, be humiliated.,.we ought to obtain something in return for the raising of sanctions:    e.g., a return to a united front against Germany, or, which was more important,satisfactory assurances a.s to a return by Italy tothe League and as to her future conduct as a memberof the League.   Admittedly, if Signor Mussolinirefused to give us any assurances we should be putin a difficult position, but it seemed, worth while to put the question to him.    If things were not madetoo hard for him Signor Mussolini might want, to get back into his former position.    It would be a mistake to try and pass the responsibility on to france ,    Of course if Prance declined to agree to asuggestion on the above lines and insisted on raisingbutsanctions, we should have no alternatives/to agree&apos;,but if Italy, could be induced to make some advancePrance would probably agree that this was the best course.    To decline to acknowledge the position ofItaly in Abyssinia would, be a mistake.    Similar
action in the case of Manchuria had proved a greatembarrassment .    It would be better to make no announcement at all of      ., recognition or other-wise .    As to the Mediterranean there was, no doubt,a good deal of anxiety among some of the smallernations, and. something ought to be done to demonstrate that we had. no intention of playingsecond-fid die in that Sea.The above views met with a good deal ofs upport .The Secretary of State for India was aversefrom anything being done that was avoidable tounderline the failure of the League, which was already having serious repercussions, even in India.He had been warned, that a Motion might be introduced&apos;in September in the Indian Legislature in favourof a withdrawal by India from the League.   For themoment he was contenting himself with pointing out to the Viceroy that this would, be a foolish coursesince we did. not know what would be the future ofthe League.   He supported the proposal that anattempt, should be made to obtain conditions inreturn for the raising of sanctions.The Home Secretary emphasised that the decision should, turn on whether, by maintaining sanctions,we should be able to get something definite inreturn?    otherwise it woul&quot;&quot;1 be better to drop themnow, when there was a distinct reason for doing so.Unless some corresponding point could be discernedin the future at which there would, be an excuse for raising sanctions, they would  just peter out and that would be the worst thing that, could,happen.    The issue, therefore, was as to whether,if sanctions were retained, something coul&apos;&apos; be
obtained in return.   Like other members of theCabinet, he objected, to an unconditional surrender,in fact a capitulation:    but before taking adecision he would like to see the promised Paperby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs *He suggested also it hat the Cabinet would be assisted by a statement as to what sanctions wereeffecting today, and what was likely to be theeffect of maintaining them,    Was it correct that by so doing we should, increase the pressure on italy?   What was the prospect of obtaining somethingby removing sanctions now or later?    The onlyreason for retaining them was to obtain something in return.One suggestion was that by surrenderingsanctions we should, be throwing away our last card.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that his experts adhered to the original estimate reached, by a Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, that by September next italy would, be in a serious position if sanctions were maintained.    Sir Erie Drummond, however, thoughtthat eight months to a year would, elapse beforesanctions became effective, owing to the fact thatthe conclusion of the war reduced, requirements .The Lord President of the Council agreed generally  with the TTome Secretary.    The question was as to whether sanctions, if to be kept on for two or three months more, would, threaten sufficientadditional pressure to justify Signor Mussolini inbuying them off at a price acceptable to the League.The price should be considered, from the point ofview of the past, the present and. the future.As regards the past, would, it be possible to get
some measure, however limited, of repentence   wwwincluded?    One difficulty of raising sanctions wasthe risk that the aggressor might now roam aboutEurope.   Would it be possible to secure an admissionfrom Signor Mussolini that some part of our case was right:    for instance, that an aggression is anerror?    As regards the future, could we get himto declare a European relationship which would be satisfactory?   T-Te himself believed that at bottomSignor Mussolini was friendly to this country andwould pay some kind of a price,    ^he real dangertoday, however, was in Europe as a whole, and whatwas to be the position in three months&apos;  time.He agreed with the Home Secretary that if nothing was to be got out of continuing sanctions weshould have to make the best case we could for raising them.A point of view which the Cabinet were askedto consider was the effect of the decision on theGovernment itself.    If it was clear that the FrenchGovernment would be unwilling to continue sanctions,then public opinion would probably accept that theycould not be continued,   there was, however, evenamong well-informed M,P&apos;s a widespread view thatthe new French Government would take a differentattitude from its predecessors, and on realisticgrounds, namely, the effect of the Italian conqueston the French position in Tunis, Djibouti and elsewhere.    We ought to take a similar view&apos;:otherwise what was left of our prestige wouldvanish, not only in the countries of the eastern mediterranean but all over Africa.   For this reason it was urged that we could, not. afford, to take a lead, in dropping sanctions.    First, at any rate,we ought to ascertain definitely the view of the
new French Government.    Signor Mussolini, it wassuggested, was not in reality friendly to thiscountry, and his internal difficulties wouldprobably drive him to a further aggression, whichmight be against us.    If other countries were goingto run out of sanctions, then it must be admitted that we must run out too&quot;,    but it was urged thatwe should not take a lead in calling them off.The Secretary of State for Scotland favouredoutting our losses as soon as possible, with asmuch dignity as we could command,   He doubted ifmuch could be obtained in the way of concessions from Signor Mussolini.   He drew attention to paragraphs 3 and 4 of Mr Lloyd mhomas&apos;s Despatchof May 20th rNo.655)  in which he quoted M, Legeras holding the opinion that the French Governmentwould, insist, at the forthcoming Meeting, on theimmediate raising of sanctions.&quot;&quot;he Prime Minister said that the matter was so important, that in his view, as there were other decisions the Cabinet had. to take that day, thediscussion should be resumed, at a further Meeting.mhe Cabinet agreed  To meet on the morning of Friday,May 29th, at a time to be fixed by the Prime Minister.

Under adecision taken in March, 1951, the export credits Guarantee Department was authorised toprovide guarantees in connection with aircraft which were neither armed nor fitted for arms andwere capable of use for civil purposes.In 1935, however, on account of the disarmamentproposals under consideration, the Departmentceased to provide facilities for the export of aircraft or aircraft engines of any description.In the latest draft Arms Convention, a distinction was recognised between civil aircraft and aircraft adapted for military purposes, and it had been represented that an extended export trade in aircraft would putaircraft construction in the United Kingdom on a broader basis and would serve as a bufferagainst the cessation of large home orders at anytime.In these circumstances, the Presidentof the Board of Trade saw no reason for the, continued exclusion of civil aircraft from theExport Credits Scheme and proposed to authorisethe Department to resume the granting of guarantees.     He reported that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs had concurred in thisproposal and that the Secretary of State for Airhad undertaken that his Department would advise
on the particular applications whether the aircraft in cuestion might probably be regarded as civil.The Secretary of State for Air confirmedthis and said it was proposed to avoid any attemptto define in advance what was a civil or a military aircraft, as difficulties had been encountered inthis matter in the past.In the course of a short discussion, theview was expressed that some means should be foundto prevent export credits being used in the case of .aeroplanes or engines intended for countries whosepolicy is threatening the peace, such as Germany andItaly,The Cabinet agreed:That the President of the Board ofTrade should be empowered toauthorise the Export credits guarantee Department to resume the granting of guarantees under theExport Credits Scheme in respect of aircraft for civil purposes.
