LLAKAGB OFINFORMATION.^employmentAssistance.[previous reference jCabinet 33(36), Gon-clusion 1)*1,      The Cabinet were informed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer that on the two days following the meetings on Thursday, June 25th, references had appeared in the Press as to the discussions in Cabineton that day.      In particular, &quot;The Times&quot; of Friday,June 2Sth, contained an account of the Meetings,including indications of the views which had been expressed on some of the points Tinder discussion.He had made inquiries and had ascertained that no statement of any kind on the subject had been issued to the Press from No.  10 Downing Street, or by theMinister of Labour.      It was very regrettable that,in regard to a problem on which it was most important that the Cabinet should be united, resyjonsiblenewspapers like &quot;The Tiraes&quot;  should suggest that onthis very important issue there were differences between members of the Cabinet and that some members were disposed to take up a more generous attitudethan others.The Secretary of State for Scotland said thatthe expression in the statement in &quot;The Times&quot; that&quot;the Standstill Order has worked smoothly&quot; had beenmade by him to the Cabinet.      He assured the Cabinetthat he had had no communication, direct or indirect,of any kind with the Press,After a brief disciission, it was agreed thatno action in regard to the matter could usefully betaken.
assistance.The new draft regulations.[ previous reference:Cabinet 45(36), Con-elusion 1.)2 . The Cabinet continued, their examination of theReport (CP.-172 (36)) of the Committee on theRegulations of the Unemployment Assistance Board,which had. been begun at their previous Meetings onThursday, June 25th.The Lord President of the Council explained thatthe Prime Minister had. requested, him to preside during his absence.   T-Ie enquired whether any member of theCahinet, in pursuance of Cabinet 45 (36), conclusion  (iii), had communicated with the Minister of labour in regard, to further figures or other information.mhe Minister of Labour stated, that he had. received,a letter from the President of the Board of Educationasking for further information,/arn4^%hatr-%h-j?s- informa-tion would, be given to the Cabinet personally by theChairman and Vice-Ohairman of the Unemployment Aasist-ance Board, later in the Meeting.The Lord President of the Council asked, whether any members of the Cabinet wished, to make any general observations before the representatives of the Boardarrived?The Presid.ent of the Board of Trade said that hehad. read, the Committee&apos;s Report and had carefullylistened, to the discussion, but still felt considerable doubt on the broad issues involved.   He gathered thatwhen the new scheme was in full operation it wouldmean the expenditure by the State on public assistanceof many millions per annum in excess of the previousexpenditure on this service.    Generally speaking, thecost of the new proposals would be about . 41 millions per annum, and. the Secretary of State for Scotland, had made suggestions which would, increase that cost byabout  600,000 per annum.    The problem involved,political difficulties of the greatest magnitude, andif an extra expenditure of  600,000 per annum would
save the Government from the grave troubles andunrest to which reference had been made,  it might hewell       worth while to make the concessions suggestedby the Secretary of State for Scotland.   He (ThePresident of the Board of Trade) was not, however,sure that by making concessions the Government couldavoid trouble and disturbance.    To what extent itmight be possible to mitigate opposition, hostilityand criticism, did. not appear from the documents which had. been circulated.   He was very much impressed, with the political difficulties, and. he doubted, whether the Cabinet had yet got all thenecessary information on which to reach a decision,and, in particular, whether further figures regardingthe ultimate effect of the new proposals should, notbe obtained.Speaking personally, he would like to go somewhatfurther in giving generous treatment than the new proposals;    not because he wished, to purchase peace by making unnecessary concessions, but because he felt genuine sympathy for the classes of persons tobe covered, by the new Regulations .    Whatever theCabinet might decide he would, support, both inParliament and on the platform.The Minister of Labour observed, that so far asthe figures were concerned, the answer to thePresident of the Board of Trade was as follows.The cost now being incurred under the existingStandstill arrangements was  40^ millions per annum for 655,000 weekly payments.    The additional cost ofliquidating the Standstill gradually over 12 monthswas about  lj millions, and. the cost of the altera-tions in the rent rule and. the earnings rule was estimated at about  500,000.   On the basis, therefore,
of the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee, thenew scheme when in full operation would cost about 41^ millions per annum for 665,000 weekly payments,while, in addition, there would be the extra cost ofliquidating the Standstill during the first IS months.In short, at the end of that period, and ^hen thescheme was working on its permanent basis, theexpenditure would be roughly  500,000 per annum more   -than it was at present .The President of the Board, of Education said, thathe fully agreed, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,that it was very desirable that on this most importantissue the Cabinet should be fully united.   He wished,in this connection to offer     a    suggestion   in regard,to the liquidation of the Standstill.   Under the planproposed by the Unemployment Assistance Board, theBoard, was to ^e empowere- by the Regulations to pay,during a transitional period, of a yea.r, more than the allowances payable under the Regulations, and. they also proposed   to effect cuts in cases of grossly excessivepayments and. in the case of young men under 25 withinthe first three months of this 12-months period...   Atthe end. of three months a knife woul^ fall, and. atthe end. of 12 months another knife would, fall, and.however difficult the position might be there would, beno way of alleviating it except by the issue of entirely new Regulations, which, in the circumstances, couldnot be contemplated.    In these conditions he was strongly of opinion that no special dates should be mentioned, in the Regulations,, and that the Board shouldbe empowered at their discretion to liquidate the standstill as they thought fit, without reference toany particular dates .    If this proposal was adopted,in certain areas the new Regulations could, be brought
into full operation very quickly and without any difficulty or trouble, while in other areas theprocess would, be a ranch more gradual one .    If some such arrangement could be made, and if he could, besatisfied on certain points of detail, he thoughtthat the revised Regulations would, be open to littleobjection.    If it was possible to persuade the Board,to liquidate the Standstill without reference to anyparticular time limits, he was&apos; satisfied, thatreasonable public opinion throughout the country would, accept the position and that there would &apos;belittle serious trouble.^he Chancellor of the Exchequer said that thesuggestion of the President of the Eoard. of Educationwas one with which he had. considerable sympathy.He had. always felt great difficulty in prescribingrigid, dates in this matter.   Apart from other considerations, this involved, giving notice inadvance to the opposition of the times when the cutswere to take effect, and would, thus enable theopposition to make their preparations accordingly.On the other hand it must be remembered, that in theview of the Board, it would be impossible to get the standstill liquidated unless the dates for liquidationwere fixed, in advance.    The Board, attached, greatimportance to the power which these dates would, give them to put pressure on the local Advisory Committees .It would be remembered, that the Board&apos;s originalsuggestion had been that all new cases coming to them should, fall for treatment under the new Regulations .They had. with some reluctance given way on thispoint, but only on condition that the liquidation ofthe Standstill should, be subject to definite time limits.   He (nhe Chancellor of the Exchequer) suggested-5-
that the proposal made by the President of the Boardof Education should, be put to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board and their observations askedupon it.The President of the Board of Education did notthink that the Eoard&apos;s arguments in favour of time limits were really sound.    The areas concerned fellinto three groups:-(l) Grossly extravagant areas, likeSouth Wales, where the new pro-posals would be regarded as .*totally inadequate:(2) The rural areas, and many ur^anareas, where the new proposals would be regarded as over-generous:(3) A middle group of areas, where thead.ministra.tion had been properlyand economically conducted, and where public opinion was sympathetic to the unemployed.In his view, if rigid time limits were imposedthere would be no incentive at all, for those concerned in administration in the third group of areas, to a.ssist in the proper liquidation of the standstill.The Lord Privy Seal enquired what would happen in areas like South Wales if there were no time limits:    was there not serious danger that in such areas the position would tend to drift?The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet thatthe present arrangements for the liquidation of the standstill represented a. compromise which, afterconsiderable discussion, had been reached beWeenhimself and the Board, and he wished- to warn theCabinet that it was not at all improbable that theBoard, would, be strongly opposed, to the modificationssuggested, by the President of the Board, of Education.He himself, however, had suggested as a possible solution that the time limit of 12 months should, beretained, but that the Board, should, have power to-6-
extend that limit if they thought fit to do so.   Hewarned, the Cabinet, however, that the Board mightnot favour this compromise.The President of the Board, of Education sawconsiderable objection to the Minister of Labour&apos;proposal.    In particular, he pointed, out that ifpower were given to the Board in the Regulations toextend beyond. 12 months, this would, have all the disadvantages without.any of the advantages of hisown proposals .*The Minister of Health said, that this was amatter on which the Board felt very strongly, and.would, certainly press for definite time limits .The Minister of Labour agreed, and. thought thatthe Board.&apos;s objections were of substance rather than of form. If no time limits were provided, the Board,might often find themselves, after discussion withthe local Advisory Committee^, in complete disagree-ment with those Committees as to what should be done the facts would, be well known, and so also would, the acute difference of opinion.The President of the Board of Education thoughtthat difficulties of this kind would, arise in anycase. It should be for the Board, to liquidate the standstill in their own time and. in their own way .The President, of the Board, of Trade enquired..whether the proposals of the President of the Board,of Education would, add greatly to the cost2The President of the Board, of Education agreedthat the cost would be increased to some extent.He contemplated, that the Standstill would, be fullyliquidated, in those parts of the country which werenot distressed, within 13 months, but that the liquidation would, take considerably longer in the
distressed areas.   He was convinced that the Govern-ment would not have public opinion behind them if theyinsisted on cuts amounting in the aggregate to 1 million per annum in South Wales being imposedwithin 12 months .The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed thatthis figure of  1 million for South Wales was an over-estimate.    He was satisfied that the proper figure was much more like  400,000 than  1 million.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defencesuggested that the proposal of the President of theBoard of Education meant placing upon a non-politicaland independent body like the Unemployment assistance board responsibilities which should be borne by theGovernment itself.    If time limits were inserted inthe Regulations the Board would have no option butto observe the time limits, and any odium attaching to such observance would fall on the Government or onParliament;    but if there were no time limits, theodium mast attack to the Board itself.mhe President of the Board of Education said thathe had always favoured the plaoingiof responsibility in such matters on the Minister of Labour and not onthe Board.The Secretary of State for Scotland pointed outthat the extra cost of liquidating the Standstill in12 months was put at  ij millions.    If the liquidationtook 18 months instead of 12 months, the additional cost during the last six months would, be about  750,000.
The Lord Privy Seal said that he had been greatlyinterested in the suggestion of the President of theBoard of Education, and he had been much impressed with what had been said about the absence of any precise information as to the ultimate effect of the new regulations and as to the desirability on this occasion of there being no &quot;hidden snags&quot;.      He was certain that 1whatever the Government decided would be represented asa very hard measure in South Wales, Durham and otherdistressed areas, and he was therefore much attracted by the idea of deleting a time limit from the liquid-ation schemem , ^e gathered that the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Labour were also of this opinion if the Unemployment Assistance Board could be persuaded to take the same view.      He thought, however,that the Cabinet&apos;s attitude on the proposal must be influenced by whatever views the Board might have about it.The Lord Chancellor said that he would like toraise one question.    At the previous meeting, theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence had urged thatthe most powerful criticism would be directed against that provision in the earnings rule relating to thecontributions to be made by the younger members of the household, and that he would like to see the unmarriedand married members of the household treated alike.He (the Lord Chancellor) agreed with this view andforesaw great difficulty in answering the attack whichwould be made on the Regulations in their present form.He enquired what the cost of making the change would be.The Minister of Labour said that it had neverhitherto been suggested that unmarried wage earningmembers of the household should be treated as boarders.
The only figures which he had were those which hehad given at the previous Meeting, namely, that ifthe 12/- was raised to 14/- for those between 18 and21 with a minimum of 20/-,  the cost would he 250,0C0 per annum, and without the minimum of20/- the cost would he  200,000 per annum.
jiven at the previous meeting, namely,.---that if the 14/-ras raised to 17/.- for tho^ over 18, the cost would be 850,000 per.-annum with a minimum of 20/-,and withoutfea%-mirni-mum--the coot would be Sj&amp;Q&amp;yO&amp;Q^per......annum.The Secretary of State for Scotland agreed that theproposal of the Lord Chancellor would be very costly.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that under the Act the Board were obliged to take into account the resources of members of the household, and while inthe case of married members with dependents it might betreasonable to treat them as boarders, it would seemclearly contrary to the letter and spirit of the Actto treat unmarried members in this generous way.Generally speaking, he felt that the Cabinet wereperhaps attaching too much importance to these questionseach ofof detail.     While/the various proposals which had beenmade would not make any very great difference to thetotal amount of the expenditure on this service, he feltthat it was necessary to see how far the Government wereprepared to go to secure peace and to meet the reasonableclaims of the destitute.     He did not wish to take upa too rigid attitude, for example in the case of the over and under 21 point in the earnings rule, but itmuch be remembered that if the claims of everybody wereto be satisfied the additional cost in the aggregatewould be very substantial.(At this point Lord Rushcliffe andSir Ernest Strohmenger joined theCabinet).The Lord President of the Council explained thatthe Cabinet had been examining the Board&apos;s proposals forrevised Regulations, and would like to hear the viewsof Lord Rushcliffe and Sir Ernest Strohmenger on certain points.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at therequest of the Cabinet he had sent Lord Rushcliffe anote of the various points which had been raised in thediscussion, so that he might have time to prepare hisanswers.      There was also a more general point whichhad been raised as to the advisability of spreading the liquidation of the Standstill over a longer period, andin particular of avoiding any fixed dates for thatliquidation.      He suggested that the points raised bythe Cabinet should be taken first. This was agreed to .The Allowance for Single Men in Lodgingsto be raised from 15/- to 17/- subjectto conclusion of Local Advisory Committee,which should be final.Lord Rushcliffe said that the suggestion that theadvice of the local Advisory Committees should prevailwas completely contrary to the Act and would undermine the authority of the Unemployment Assistance Board.15/- to 17/- according to need would be less favourable than the new proposals which were 15/- subject to suchadjustment as is necessary to meet the need.    If theproposal was, in effect, that the past practice of LocalAuthorities should determine the rate in any area, itwas unfair to applicants and of very doubtful legality.As regards the figure of 15/-, Lord Rushcliffepointed out the   essential difference between Unemploy-ment benefit and the Board1 s scale allowance.Unemployment benefit depended on how much the Unemploy-ment Fund could pay.      The Fund was now solvent and ithad been thought right to raise the amount of benefit from the 15/3d.  to which it had been cut in the periodof depression to 17/-.      The scale allowance, on theother hand, was based on the need of the applicant.In fact,; before and for some time after transitional payments were put on a needs basis, over a very large
part of the country the needs rate was substantially less than 17/-*.     The gradual adoption by many LocalAuthorities of the rate of 17/- during and since 1934-was undoubtedly due to the Exchequer taking financial responsibility for transitional payments.     He had little doubt that if it was decided to raise the Unemploymentbenefit rate to 18/- or 20/- the extravagant LocalAuthorities would still further relax their views asto need, and would pay those rates.      It would, therefore,be seen that there was no real connection of any kindbetween the amount of Unemployment benefit and thescale allowance for need.The greatest possible caution should be observed in regard to the scales.      If care was not taken it mightbe found that in a large number of cases the scalepayments would equal or exceed the benefit rates, and the insured person would at once ask why he should pay contributions if he could get as much or more by applyingfor public assistance.      In such an event the wholeinsurance scheme would be in grave danger of collapse.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it hadbeen suggested that in parts of the country 15/- was really insufficient.Lord Rushcliffe pointed out that 15/- was really a token payment.      The Board proposed to use their dis-cretion to make payments above or below 15/- after considering the needs of the individual applicants.The President of the Board of Education observedthat there was to be no cut in the case of single menin lodgings over 55, and that the cut in the case of single men over 45 would not at once be enforced.Would it not be possible to have a similar arrangement under which the question whether the cuts would be made or not would be determined, not by the age of the
applicant &quot;but by the character of the areas in whichthey lived.Sir Ernest Strohmenger doubted whether any suchsystem was really practicable.    For example, therewere very many cases in Glasgow where, on enquiry, ithad been demonstrated that 15/- was fully adequate.The amount charged by lodging-house keepers depended on the rates paid to the applicants,&apos; and where thoserates were raised, the lodging-house keepers oftenput up their charges by a corresponding amount.The Secretary of State for Scotland enquire whether this tendency also applied to the cost of food in lodging-houses.      In Glasgow the cost of food in common lodging-houses was 9/4d. and the rent variedbetween 3/- and 5/- ia week.      He had had no answeras to how he could defend a 15/- allowance in suchc i r cams t ances.Sir Ernest Strohmenger explained that the rentcharged in such cases varied in different areas ofand in the same area,the country/     As he had said, in Glasgow it had beenfound that in a lf:rge number of cases 15/- was fully adequate.    If it proved inadequate, the Eoard could,and would,  increase it.The Earnings Rule.    Why discriminate against earners in the 18-21 group?Lord Rushcliffe explained the Board&apos;s proposals,and pointed out that there were very large numbersof young wage earners in the households earningtherelatively small wages.    If/same rule were applied to both young and adult earners and was generous enough&apos;to the adult earner, it would in effect operate to exclude a very large number of earners from themeans test.    To accept this principle would be entirely contrary to the facts of working class homelife, and would not be fair to the older wage earners
on whom the burden of contributing to the householdneeds would mainly fall.in question the age groups/were well recognised in certainIndustrial and Trade&apos; Board Agreements, and the positionmanywas much the same as regards the practice of/ LocalAuthorities.    The real question was whether it was rightunder 21to say that a young man/earning, say 20/- a week, shouldmake no contribution whatever to the expenses of the household of which he was a member.In reply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, SirErnest Strohmenger explained that in the case of a youngwage earner earning 20/- a week,, the Board thought itor 4/-right that he should be asked to contribute 3/-/beyondthe cost of his keep to the expenses of the household.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that ifthere was no differentiation in the 18-21 group., thetendency might be for the younger members of the group to prefer the dole to employment.The&apos; Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries pointedout that it was not the practice in Scotland to differ-entiate according to age.Sir Ernest Strohmenger replied that it was thepractice in Scotland for some Local Authorities to dis-criminate very severely against the adult wage earners.He agreed that in Glasgow the only differentiation is between first and second and subsequent wage earners.In reply to q\iestions, Lord Rushcliffe said that,practice ofspeaking broadly, in Durham the^Commissioner was less generous than the board&apos;s revised Regulations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer enquired what wouldbe the effect on the Authorities in England and Wales ofageremoving the y discrimination?
Sir Ernest Strohmenger said that many EnglishLocal Authorities would he greatly embarrassed.      he agreed that there was no discrimination in London,Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool, but on the otherhand these places gave less generous treatment to thesecond and subsequent members of the family than wouldbe given under the new proposals.Should not the group of &quot;Other Members&quot;in the proposals be treated as boarders,and indeed why should not all sons betreated as boarders?Lord Rushcliffe said that the short answer tothis proposal was that it could not be done under theexisting law.      Under the Act, resources of all membersof the household must be taken into account in deter-mining the need of the applicant, due regard being hadto the personal requirements of the earner of theresources, and the utmost it was possible to do, there-fore, was to take the fairest and most reasonable viewof the amount of earnings which should be disregardedas required for the personal use of the earner.      Inthe case of a married son,with dependents, who is anearning member of the applicant1s household, it n&amp;apossible to set aside for the personal requirementsof the earner and his dependents so much of hisearnings (other than very high earnings) as to leavehis contribution to the household expenses no morethan if he and his dependents were ordinary boardersin his father&apos;s house.      But it was not possible todeal with the unmarried son with the same wage togive this result.    The amount which would have to beallowed for personal requirements would be whollyunreasonable.The Minister for Co-ordinction of Defencementioned the case of the young man in the household
who was contemplating matrimony.Sir Ernest Strohmenger said that circumstancesof this kind would he taken into account.      Marriedmembers of the household, with dependents, would, ineffect though not in form, be treated as though they wereboarders because of the substantial amount which could be disregarded for personal requirements, but this would notbe possible in the case of all persons in Class (IV) -Other Members.Depressed Areas. What will the ultimateeffect of the proposed Regulations be inthe Depressed Areas?Sir Ernest Strohmenger said that so far as theDepressed Areas are areas in which serious anomalieshave grown up, the effect of the Regulations on thesame numbers and under existing conditions when the standards were fully established would be a reductionof the total amount of the present allowances, thedifference going to other areas which have adhered to reasonable standards.      Taking Wales as a whole,  forinstance, it was roughly estimated that if Regulationswere applied at once without any change of conditions,there might be a net reduction at the rate of  400,000per annum.      In fact, under the liquidation arrangementscontemplated by the Board,  it was very improbable thatthere would be any net reduction in the first year.It was not wholly irrevalent to point out also that a.substantial additional sum of public money would go into Wales on the block grant revision next year.Scotland, as a whole, would not lose.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defenceenquired how much of the  400,000 was indefensibleexpenditure on any basis.
Sir Ernest Strohmenger said thrt it was notpossible to give any precise figure.     All theDepressed Areas would benefit considerably from the revision of the block grant in 1937.Effect of the Regulations indifferent Areas on number of reductions and money distri-buted, and can information begiven of the amount of the reductions which would be made if the Regulations werearithmetically applied?The Chancellor of the Exchequer explainedthat the Cabinet wished, if practicable, tohave before them figures showing what theultimate effect of the new Regulations would
Sir Ernest Strohmenger said that the Boardhesitated very much to speak with any certainty asto what would he the ultimate effect when the Regulationscame into full operation.      It would be possible toprepare estimates based on the arithmetical applicationof the new Regulations to all applicants at once and inthe circumstances existing at this moment;    but any such estimates would be wholljr misleading, because the new regulations would not be applied arithmetically but were going to be applied not at once but gradually over a con-siderable period, during which the personnel would change and there would also be a change in the circumstances andconditions of those concerned.      The Board would hesitate to draw a picture of what would happen now, but they were quite unable to draw a picture of what would happen in ISor 18 months&apos;  time, because wholly wrong deductions v/ould be drawn from any such presentation.      Some time ago theBoard had supplied similar information regarding one hundred areas, but, for the reasons which he had given,the Minister of Labour had decided to make no use of thefigures.In reply to questions, Sir Ernest Strohmenger gavereasons for the Board&apos;s view that the statistics inquestion would be misleading and useless.      For example,every week there came under the Board 7,000 persons whohad run out of Unemployment Benefit.     At the moment therewere about 100,000 persons under the Board in South Wales,and in 12 months&apos;  time there might still be 100,000 inSouth Wales, but they would to a very large extent be different persons, and their circumstances and conditions would also be different.      For example, a man who came to the Board for the first time when the new regulations were in operation was in a different position
from the man who had been under the Board, throughoutand. had suffered, a reduction of his allowance.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs thought that the Cabinet ought to have before themfigures showing the ultimate effect of the new proposals, if only to answer the case made byMembers of Parliament who would, obtain the figuresrele-ting to their own constituencies .The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested, thatit would be inadvisable to have these figuresprepared, and. that it would be much better for theGovernment to base their case on the benefits whichthe new proposals would, give, rather than attemptto fight on the ground, chosen by the Opposition.The Minister of Labour agreed, and. did not see how it would be possible for any. Member of Parliamentto obtain the figures relating to his own constiuency.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs didnot wish to use any figures which might be obtained,in public, but he still thought that it was very desirable that Ministers should. ha.ve them/p:&amp;-^n&amp;-f-&amp;^jThe Home Secretary thought that the challengemight be put in a form in which figures would, haveto be produced:    for example, what would, have beenthe effect now if the new Regulations had. come intooperation on the 1st October, 1935.   He agreed withthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that itwould, be very undesirable to publish any figures .Seeing that transitional payments in durham County were administered by government Commissloners, why should there be any substantial number of reductions in this County?Sir Ernest Strohmenger indicated, to the Cabinetthe extent of, and. reasons for, the reductions.
While it was true that the Coramissloner&apos; s scale of16/- for single men was more generous than the new proposals, and that in households there would &quot;be somecuts, the new proposals were substantially more generous, on average, than the practice of theCommissioner.   On balance, Durham would gain fromthe new proposals, though in certain cases there werecuts which would have to be made.   From a test whichwas made some time ago for the Minister of Labour, inthe conditions at that time, it was estimated thatthe percentage of cases where cuts would have to bemade in Durham was about 25, while about 50 per cent,of the cases would benefit undpr the new proposals .benefit under the new proposals .The Minister of Agriculture and. Fisheries pointedout that in the scale the allowances for juvenileswere considerably below the practice in Scottishindustrial areas.    For example, for age 18-21 theBoard&apos;s scale rate was Q/- as compared with 10/- in edinburgh and. an even higher figure in other districts .Sir Ernest Strohmenger pointed out that theBoard&apos;s scale rates for children were more generousthan the Scottish practice .    It was not really fair to pick out individual items in the scale:    the scaleshould be taken as a whole .   There was no doubt thatScottish Local Authorities had. adopted very laxstandards, and that the rates now being paid in theindustrial districts in Scotland, were of a verygenerous character.The Minister of Agriculture and. Fisheries thoughtthat it would be correct to say that throughout theScottish industrial areas heavy cuts /would, have to besuffered.The Minister of Labour agreed, that there would, bepersons who would suffer cuts, but there would alsobe many persons now in receipt of allowances&apos; under
the existing Regulations whose position would be greatly improved under the new Regulations.The Cabinet agreed  To adjourn their discussion andto meet again in the Prime Minister&apos;room at the House of Commons thesame evening at 5.45.pvm.(NOTE:    On the instructions of the lord president of the Council this discussion has been fully recorded.)2, Whit ehall Gardens, S.W.1,June 29, 193 6.
