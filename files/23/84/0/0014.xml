Ug anglo-EgyptianIreaty nego-liATlONS .[previous reference:Oabinet 42(36), Con-Eelusion 3.)1. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in connection with the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations :,-CP.-160 (36) submitting for theconsideration of his colleaguesdrafts of military Articles of a future Anglo-Egyptian Treaty andcertain comments on and explana-tions of the proposals contained therein:CP.-177 (36) relating to the lengthof the period, of occupation ofAlexandria.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported the receipt of a telegram from Cairoindicating that Nahas Pasha, though adopting areasonable attitude, was growing anxious andembarrassed at the delay in the negotiations.   he hoped, therefore, that a decision would be reached that day.The Prime Minister reported, that the CabinetCommittee had held two or three meetings and. had discussed these questions with Sir Miles Lampson.At an early stage of the Meeting Sir Miles Lampson,the British High Commissioner in Egypt, was invited,to enter the Cabinet Room.The First Lord of the Admiralty,although he was in full agreement with the foreign secretary that it was essential to get a Treaty,suggested that/ Sir Miles Lampson might be instructed to press the egyptians further with a view to avoiding sodefinite a statement, of what the position was to beat the end of twenty years .   The possibility of a reference to the League of Nations would be a shock to certain sections of public opinion in this country,particularly at the present time, &quot;when the Leaguewas rather discredited.   He recalled that two
telegrams from Cairo, which he had quoted at theCabinet Committee, gave the impression that nahas pasha did not want the situation stated too definite-ly,    If the T-Iigh Commissioner could not secure thisobject, he would like to see more explicit referencesintroduced into the Treaty as to the permanence of the alliance and the joint, responsibility of the twocountries for the protection of the Suez Canal:otherwise we should get into the same difficulty ashad. arisen over the Iraq frontier.    In that case wehad anticipated that we could secure our objects atthe League without difficulty.    In the event, most ofthe countries   for the reason that they wereinherently jealous of us as a colonial Power  opposed our wishes, and a thoroughly unsatisfactoryarrangement had to be accepted. There was a risk of reaching that position over Egypt.In reply to a request for further detail, theFirst Lord explained that he would, like provision tobe included, in the Treaty for its continuance until such time as a change was desired.    For example,provision might be made for discussion,if desired by either party, at the end of 19 years; but, if agreement was not reached, for a continuance of theTreaty .The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at onetime he had preferred to leave the position vagueafter 20 years, but he had abandoned this positionwhen he was told that at the end. of that time weshould, have lost the rights we no1?&apos; claimed.There was general agreement that the provisionenabling forces to be sent in an apprehended emergencywas of great practical and political importance.The provision that had been made for the submission of differences, either to the League of Nations or to
9 9 3*u a asuch other person or body of persons as the HighContracting Parties might agree upon, was alsocommended, more especially from a political point ofview .The Secretary of State for Air suggested, that in cp.-ISO (36), page 4, Para. 11, words to the following effect should, be added, after &quot;7 and 8&quot;:-&quot;and have rega.rd to the continuinginterest/ of both parties in thesecurity of the Canal&quot;.His proposal was that the words should, conform as closely as possible to those used, by Nahas Pasha in a recent communication.tThis was generally agreed, to.Sir Miles Lampson said he thought he might beable to secure this addition provided it was not apoint on which he would, have to break in case of necessity.Asked as to whether it would be possible to postpone the military clauses until some progress could, be made with the other parts of the Treaty,Sir Miles Lampson said, that this might be possible,but it would be contrary to the principles on whichthe conversations had. so far proceeded on our ownproposition, namely, that, we should, deal with themilitary clauses first,&apos; the Sudan secondhand theremainder of the Treaty thereafter.   He confirmed,that both parties to the conversations were inagreement that they were not committed by anything which they had. agreed, to under each head, unless an agreed. Treaty was reached.The Chancellor of the Exchequer criticised, thefollowing words in draft Article 9 (second, paragraph,line 5):-&quot;If there has been any differencebetween the Contracting Parties&quot;.
ti &amp; ^yprus *previous reference:Cabinet 18pS), Con-elusion 11.)Why. he asked, could the wording not be&quot;If the High Contracting Partiesdo not agree&quot;?Sir Miles Lampson explained that the presentwording had been taken from the 1930 Treaty, and, ashe had said before, any alteration in wording awakenedthe suspicions of the Egyptian Delegation.Several members of the Cabinet expressed a prefer-ence for the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s wording,and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreedto see if it could be adopted.The Secretary of State for Air (who had to leavethe Cabinet early to keep another official engagement)said that he held the view that on merits the conclu-sion of a Treaty was of vital importance.    It wasnecessary to take into account the proportion of riskinvolved in the different courses.    He would, have preferred a different Treaty, but realised that wecould not hope for 100 per cent, security.    But a friendly Egypt by itself would provide an enormoussecurity, more particularly if we could arrive at thekind of relation between the British and Egyptianforces that had existed between the military forcesat Mersa Matruh and between the air forces in Egypt.He attached great importance to the &quot;apprehendedemergency&quot;provision.     He thought also that Cyprusought to be developed as a military base, certainlyfor the air, and probably also for the army and. navy.If military and air forces were maintained in cyprus and. naval forces were available, as they normally wrere,in the Eastern Mediterranean, whether at a new base in Cyprus or elsewhere,  the possibilities of reinforc-ing Egypt would, be very considerable.  &apos;Referring to talks he had had. with Mr Pirow, theMinister of Defence in South Africa, he said the latter
had agreed with him that there was no alternative tothe Eastern air route, which must be maintained.Mr Pirow had explained that that was one reason why,in his view, Tanganyika could not be given back tothe Germans.    It made all the difference, however,to that route to have a friendly Egypt and. the Sudan.For all these reasons he thought that the chances of obtaining security from a Treaty outweighedinsistence on particular points of detail.The Secretary of State for /Var agreed generally with the Secretary of State for Air, including his remarks on Cyprus .    The Chief of the Imperial General&apos;Staff held that, from a military point of view, ifthe troops were withdrawn from Cairo a battalion at alexandria would be unsafe and he would prefer itswithdrawal to the Canal Zone.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs reported, that the Foreign Secretary had. again seenrepresentatives of the Dominions now in London, whohad. unanimously been willing to accept the settlementnow proposed.Buation in The Secretary of State for the Colonies said, that^-estine .the troubles in Palestine were not likely to enddeviousllference until the Arabs knew the result o^ the Treaty negotia-Cabinet 41fp^), Con-^        tions .    In Palestine the pipe conveying the water-conclusion 6.)supply of Jerusalem had. been blown up, notwithstanding the measures taken to protect it.    A good, many troops were locked, up in looking after the Haifa pipeline.This situation rendered, it important to get a. settle-withment of the Treaty /.    Egypt as soon as possible.He thought that the opposition in the House of commons would be limited, to a comparatively email section.Many M..P&apos;s thought that if we could get 20 years in Egypt with improved, relations between the British
and Egyptian army and better social relations generally,there was great hope for the future.   We could notavoid, talcing risks somewhere, and Sir Miles Lampsonshould be given as free a hand as the Cabinet found possible to secure a Treaty.The Secretary of State for India said that the trouble among Mohammedans in India, to which he had referred at the previous Meeting, was growing,especially in the Punjab, where there had been communaldifficulties for some time.   He himself, therefore,favoured a Treaty.   He had understood, however, that ,the Committee of Imperial Defence attached greatimportance to the maintenance of troops at Alexandria,and he found this difficult to reconcile with the remarks of the Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for War said, that theChief of the Imperial General Staff would prefer tohave troops at Cairo and. Alexandria, but once the cairo position wras abandoned he thought the maintenanceof troops at Alexandria unsound.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence thought the position was as stated by the Secretary of Statefor War.    The Chiefs of Staff Committee had urged themaintenance of troops at Cairo and. at Alexandria ifwe wanted a maximum of security:    but if the Cairoposition had to be given up they did. not, he thought,attach so much importance to Alexandria from a military point of view.    They realised, the difficulties of thepolitical situation.The First Lord, of the Admiralty said that the naval staff were prepared to accept the suggestions as regardsAlexandria provided, that they were to have a base inthe Mediterranean,    It would, however, be dangerous to give up Alexandria until a base had. been established,at Cyprus .
0^70 6 sir Miles Lampson said, that he proposed, to tryfor our right to retain a garrison at Alexandria,for 10 years, and not to accept a shorter period, than years.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked, him alsoto try and arrange for an extension of the periodif both parties agreed..Sir Miles Lampson thought, this was possible .The Lord. Chancellor said, he had. always regarded the Suez Canal as an essential link in the BritishEmpire and. had. objected, to the reference of thequestion to a.ny outside body.   His reluctance inthat respect had not been removed , but he agreed, thatthe provisions as regards reinforcement in anapprehended, emergency considerably improved, theposition.   Without that he could, not have acceptedthe proposals now before the Cabinet.   Notwithstandinghis confidence in Sir Miles Lampson, he could, not a.greewith one suggestion that had been made, that heshould be given a free hand, in the negotiations .The importance of the question at issue was too vital.He thought, however, that a case could, be made injustification of the proposals now under consideration,xvhole, therefore.On the/he favoured, an attempt to reach a Treaty, andhe urged, that it should, be concluded, as soon aspossible.   With reference to Article 9, he himselfpreferred, reference to the Council of the League ofNations, which rarely reached, a decision, ratherthan to some outside body.    He had. been glad, to hearof the possibilities of Cyprus.Referring to the words in square brackets at theend. of CP.-160 (36), Annex. Article 8, para.2,viz . :-\Provisions will have to be inserted, hereabout Alexandria and. the withdrawal ofthe troops f^om Cairo  .....
he pointed out that these words ought to be inserted in Article 9.   Article 8, where it was proposed to insert them at the present time, dealt with a provisionof a continuing character, viz., our right to ensurethe protection of our essential communications in anapprehended emergency.    Clearly the provisions aboutAlexandria and Cairo were of a different character and ought to be inserted in Article 9.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to look into this.The Lord Chancellor also pointed out that thesecond paragraph of Article 9 provided for submission,in case of disagreement, to the Council of the Leagueof Nations or some other agreed, body, of the question&quot;whether the presence of British forces is no longer necessary owing to the fact that the Egyptian army is in a position to ensure by its own resources the liberty and entire security of navigation on the Canal&quot;,but did not provide in terms any specific provision to deal with any disagreement as to the number and location of the British troops .The Lord Chancellor also urged, that Article 14was not required.    So far as the settlement of a dispute as to the presence of British forces in the suez Canal zone was concerned, this was provided, forin Article 9.    The suggestion, he understood, had beenmade that Article 14 was required in connection withthe capitulatory relations of the Treaty.   Any alter-ation there, however, would depend upon the attitudeof the capitulatory Powers, and Article 14 was notrequired, in that connection, nor, so far as he could,see, for anything else.
Sir Miles Lampson said there were two points:first, Article 14 was thought to be a convenient wayof stating the permanency of the alliance?    and,second, there was the old. difficulty that Article 14had been included in the 1930 Treaty and itsdeletion would arouse suspicions among the Egyptians.The Home Secretary pointed, out that this adherence to 1930 could hardly be adopted as a rule in chief.In reply to a question. Sir Miles Lampson said,that provision was made in an Annex, which had. notbeen circulated., that Cairo and. Alexandria should,not be evacuated until the barracks, communications,and. so forth, provided, for in the Treaty, had. beencompleted .The President of the Poard. of Education said, thathe had always preferred a Treaty limited, to 20 years without provision for the future.   He had not changed,his view as to reference to the League of Nations.The position would become very difficult when theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs was explaining to Parliament that there was no danger to ourposition in Egypt in this provision while nahas pasha was explaining to the Egyptian Parliament the exact opposite.The Lord. President of the Council hoped, that sir Miles Lampson would, not be instructed, to breakon any of the points of detail decided at the Cabinetthat morning.&quot;The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence agreed,with the Lord President.    Two or three big decisions had. been taken and. we ought not to allow the treaty to break down on relatively minor points .    It wouldbe deplorable if the Egyptian Delegation becameirritated, to the point where they would, raise allkinds.of minor difficulties.
In reply to a question, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that if Sir Miles Lampson got into difficulties he would report to London.The Prime Minister said thai the immediatereasons for the early conclusion of a Treaty were there actions of failure on the Arab area.    The situationin the Near Fast was one of considerable gravity.There was also the danger of disturbance in Egyptitself if a Treaty was not concluded.    This might lockup 80,000 men.   Already there were a number ofbattalions in Palestine, and more might be required.Failure to conclude a Treaty would add. a disorganisedNear East to the existing disturbed state in Europe .Tt was essential, therefore, to obtain a. Treaty.He agreed that some of its provisions might be a shock to some sections of public opinion, but the provisionenabling us to send forces in an apprehended emergencymade a great difference.   He hoped, that in 20 years&apos;time, as some members of the Cabinet had indicated,our position in the Fastern Mediterranean would, bevery much stronger than it was today, with troops near to the Canal.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the dra^t military clauses submitted by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs in his memorandum cp.-160 (36), subject to further eon-si deration by the  Secretary of State ofthe following proposals:-(i) Annex.    Article 8:    words in square brackets at the end of second paragraph:Removal of provisions aboutAlexandria and  the withdrawalof troops from Cairo, fromArticle 8 to Article 9:(ii) Annex. Article 9..

Article 14:   Insert atthe end of the penultimatesentence, that is to say,after the words  &quot;Articles 6,7 and. 8&quot;  (C .P.-1S0 (35) ,page 4, line 11) some suchphrase as the following:-&quot;and have regard to the continuing interest ofboth parties in thesecurity of the Canal&quot;  the actual words used in draftingfollowing as closely as possiblethose used by Nahas Pasha:(b) That, as regs.rd.s Alexandria, theproposals of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs in CP.-177 (3 6)should be approved:    that is to say,Sir Miles Lampson should be instructedto put forward 10 years as the time limit, and to agree to 7 years if it proved, impossible to secure the higher figure.    In add.ition, he should, try toinclude provision for an extension ofthe period if desired, by both parties:(c) That the modifications proposed, above to CP.-160 (36)  and CP.-177 (3 6)should, not be insisted, on to the pointof a breakdown of the Treaty negotia-tions:(d) That if Sir Miles Lampson should fail to reach agreement with the egyptian delegation he should, report to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(The -Tome Secretary and the Secretary&apos; Of Statefor Air left at this poiint.)&quot;

In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the problems facing HisMajesty&apos;s Government as a result of the Italo-Leaguedispute:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs ( CP.-165 (36))analysing the situation and. derivingthe conclusions quoted in the Minutesof the previous Meeting:A Report thereon by the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee (CP.-174 (36)),circulated by direction of the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence, in which their views were summarised as follows:-(a)(b)(b)(d)(e)Our interests lie in a peacefulMediterranean, and this can onlybe achieved, by returning to astate of friendly relations with italy.    This should, be our aimeven in the earliest steps we take to liquidate the Mediterraneansituation.One of the objects of raisingsanctions is to enable us towithdraw our extra forces at presentin the Mediterranean, and. to returnto a state of normal distributionwhich will permit us to be moreready to defend our interests atHome or in the Far East .   A Declara-tion in the form suggested, ifconsidered provocative by Italy,would postpone that event.   Moreover,in order to give practical effect toour assurance wre could not return to normal defence arrangements.Although we want to have a friendly-Greece and Turkey, it is most desirablethat that end. should be reached bymeans which will not increase orperpetuate tension.    This applieswith even greater force in the caseof Yugoslavia, which is very weak and where purely British interests are very small.Even afterArticle 16remains inaggressionThis would,to Greece,sanctions are raised,of the Covenant presumablyforce to check any furtherby Italy in the near future.appear to provide a guaranteeTur key and. Yugn s 1 aviation -The assistance we could expect from greece, Turkey and. Yugoslavia is verysmall.    This country would, give morethan it receives.   The main burden would fall upon our forces, and we hope thatall means will be adopted to reduce the likelihood of war and the period of tension.
The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that he would he glad if the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee could stuxiy the proposals in his memorandum for an Eastern MediterraneanUnderstanding with Turkey and Greece on the lines suggested in CP, 165 (36),     Apart from this,however, he did not ash for any decision from theCabinet on the present occasion as he would prefer to take stock of the position at Genevabefore the suggestion was discussed in Cabinet,The Question was raised as to whetherthe memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Committee(CoP, 174- (36)) was to be interpreted as adisagreement from the statement by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in the House ofCommons on the 18th June,The First Lord of the Admiralty said hehad discussed the matter with the Chief of theNaval Staff who took no objection to a continuanceof any existing commitment, hut took a strong viewagainst the adoption of any further commitments.In fact, he was hoping for a development at Genevawhich would be in such a form as to enable italy as well as other Mediterranean nations to beincluded in any understanding.     This would enablethe present concentration of ships in the eastern mediterranean to come to an end.     He asked if theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs could not raise the question with the Italian Government and obtain an undertaking by them not to show resentmentto Greece and Turkey,The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs thought that the Italian Government had not- 16 -
