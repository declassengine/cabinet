THE BUDGET .AllegedLeakage .(previous reference:Cabinet 29(36), Con-elusion 3,)F. r. u-o^6)3l1. The Chang-ellor of the Exchequer&apos;reported thaton Friday last he had seen the Chairman of Lloyds,whose statement had conveyed to his mind that theremay have been a leakage of Budget secrets, although no particular source of leakage was indicated .In view of the public interest in the subject itappeared necessary to have an Inquiry.    As to theform of the Inquiry there were two alternatives:-(l) A Select Committee of the House of past experience had led. both the Prime Minister and himself to favour the latter course.    In order toobtain the necessary powers under the Act a resolution of both Houses of Parliament ^ould be necessary, andhe proposed, to make an announcement on the subjectthat very day.    The Court of Inquiry would consist ofa King&apos;s Bench Judge and two Barristers .^he Prime Minister mentioned that another alleged,breach of privilege ha&quot;1 taken place.   An article hadbeen published suggesting that, immediately after theannouncement, in the budget Speech., Members ofParliament had crowded to the telephone to pass onthe information to interested quarters.    The Parlia-mentary Secretary to the Treasury wae in communicationwith the Speaker of the TTouse of Commons with a viewto a possible Committee of Privileges .   Whether aCommittee could, act while this question was sub-iudice he did. not know.It was suggested that a Committee of Privilegesmight be appointed, but might adjourn during theJu^ic i al Inquiry.Commons(2) A Judicial Committee under themribunal of Inquiry (Evidence)Act,  1921.
The Secretary of State for Scotland, recalling acase in Scotland, where an Inquiry had been set up underthe Act of 1921. made two suggestions:    first, that instead of composing the Inquiry entirely of Barristers(apart  from the Chairman) business men might be includedand. secondly, that people might be invited to come forward, and offer evidence.   As regards the firstproposal, however, it was suggested that it was only aquestion of fact that had to be decided, and. technical consideration were not involved.The Cabinet agreed.  (a) mo approve the proposal of theChancellor o^&quot; the Exchequer thatan Inquiry into the alleged leakage of Budget secrets should, be set up under fee mribunai of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921:(b) nhat the Chancellor of the exchequer should, announce it in the T-Touse ofCommons the same afternoon.
THE italo-ABYSSINTANDISPUTE.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(3 6), Con-elusion 4.)The Emperor&apos;departure.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that on Saturday, May 2nd, he had receivedtelegrams to show that the Emperor of Abyssinia wasabout to leave Addis Ababa and wished, to proceed to palestine.   He had asked if he could travel in aBritish man-of-war.   The Secretary of State had firstcommunicated with the French Government, through theCharge&apos; d&apos;  Affaires, and asked, them to state their position.    In reply to a question by the Charge&quot;d&apos;Affaires he had said that the British Governmentwould be prepared to take the Emperor away fromDJibuti if the French Government approved,    ^he Charged&apos;Affaires, after communicating with Paris, had reported that the French Government had no objection.mhe Secretary of State had then asked for a rather more definite answer, since the Emperor was actually in French territory. . In the meanwhile he had. placedhimself in communication with the Admiralty, who had sent the Destroyer DIANA to DJibuti on Saturday eveningfor communication purposes - since there was only aCommercial Consul at Djibuti, who had no cipher.A message had then been sent through the DIANA to theEmperor informing him that his request was receivingcareful consideration and that a repljf would be sentwith the least possible delay.    On Sunday the FrenchCharge d&apos;Affaires had reported that France would,welcome the Emperor at Djibuti and give facilities farembarking him in any ship in which he wished to travel.^hat was the utmost that could be got from the FrenchGovernment.    After consulting the Prime Minister theSecretary of State had. then decide&apos;&apos; to comply with theEmperor&apos;? request and to send a Cruiser to Djibutito take the Emperor all the way to Haifa.   He had again sent for the French Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires, who had said, that the French Government concurred and would
facilitate the Emperor&apos;s embarkation.   He hoped that by this time the Emperor might have started on board,the Cruiser, though he had. no definite news as yet.As soon as he heard the Emperor had. started, he proposedto issue a Press communiaue&quot;, adding that the Emperorwas travelling incognito.    This was necessary toavoid complicated questions as to salutes.   He would,also explain that the Emperor was on his way to palestine, hut on the clear understanding that he wouldtake no further action to support military operations.He would, hand, a copy of the cormiiunique&apos; to Slgnor Grandi,as up to now, after careful consideration, he ha^d.ecid.ed. to   make no communication to the ItalianGovernment.OThe Secretary of State for the Colonies reported,that there had. been further rioting in Palestine and.that the situation there was bad.    The High Commissioner,however, had agreed, to receive the Emperor in Palestine.There was some discussion as to whether there was any risk of an attempt by the Italians to interferewith the Emperor&apos;s voyage .    ^he Cabinet were reminded,that technically the Abyssinians and. Italians wer;  notat war;    they could not, therefore, claim belligerentrights.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported,that the news from Addis Ababa was still bad.    &quot;here was a great deal of shooting.    It now transpired, thatthe heavy rains hai come and. the Italians wereexperiencing the utmost difficulty in getting to addis ababa.   Had the Emperor delayed his departure for a few hours he might have change^ his mind, more especially as the French Government that had now come into power was much more sympathetic to sanctions on Italy.
He proposed, however, to bring up any questions arising out of the situation in Abyssinia at theregular weekly Meeting of the Cabinet on Wednesday.The Cabinet took note of and. approved,the arrangements made by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs for the conveyance of the Emperor of Abyssiniato Palestine.^he Prime Minister asked, his colleagues to be careful to make no public allusionto the Emperor of Abyssinia, until it was known that he was on board a BritishCruiser.
FORETG-N POLICY. 3.    The Cabinet had before them a re-draft of theQuestions to be revised, draft Despatch to Hie MajestyTs Ambassador at.addressed to theGerman Govern - Berlin (CP.-125 (36)).    The re-draft was discussed,latent *paragraph by paragraph, with the following results:-(Previous Paragraph 1 was approved.Reference:Cabinet 32 Par a graph 2 .    The Lord. Privy Seal handed, the(36), Con-clusion 3,) Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs forfv/S -34- 6s0/. his consideration a new sentence to beinserted in line 5 with the object of promoting still further the aim of thisparagraph, which was to persuade the germans to consider the Questions in a sympatheticspirit .The Lord. President of the Council alsohanded, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs a suggested, addition to this para.-graph with the obje t of explaining to theGermans exactly why these Questions werera.ised., namely, in order that a completeunderstanding might be reached upon them.Para graph 5. The Home Secretary handed theSecretary of State&apos; for Foreign Affairs asuggestion for re-drafting the la*t fourlines o^ this paragraph with a view to makingthe meaning rather clearer.   The draft was as follows&quot;......though Your Excellency knowsthat His Majesty&apos;s Government regret that the German Government has.. notbeen able to make a mor^ substantial contribution towards the re-establish-ment of the confidence which is suchan essential preliminary to the widenegotiations which the German Govern-ment envisage and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are no less anxious to pursue&quot;.P_ara.graph 4 .    Several suggestions were madefor amending the passage at the top of page 2.
The suggestion that net with most favourwas to substitute in line 2 &quot;the generalnegotiation&quot; for &quot;any general negotiation&quot;.A suggestion was also raa.de that afterthe word &quot;open&quot; should he added &quot;with areasonable prospect of success&quot;.Paragraph 6.    The inquiry as to whetherGermany now regards, herself as possessed of &quot;complete equality&quot; was criticised onthe ground that it was likely to lead toa reopening by Germany of the question of colonies.    In this connection it was recalled that the word &quot;colonial&quot; equalityhad. been used by the Germans.After considerable discussion the ^omeSecretary handed to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs a re-draft of the para-graph, designed to bring out the point asto whether Germany had arrived at a point when she could conclude &quot;genuine Treaties&quot;but without using the word?  &quot;genuineTreaties&quot; .mhe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, in promising to consider this draft, emphasised that this was a pointin which the whole of Europe was intenselyinterested.Paragraph 7 was accepted.Paragraphs 8 and. ,9 .    Doubts were raised,once more as to the wisdom of includingParagraph 8, which asked for an explanation of the distinction between the Reich andthe German nation.The Secretary of State ?or ForeignAffairs informed the Cabinet that this again
was a matter in which every nation in europe was intensely interested.The Lord President of the Councilsuggested, that what was required was toobtain from Germany an undertaking thatshe would, not alter the territorial andpolitical status of Europe by her ownfree will.    If she desired, to alter itshe must bring it before the properinternational body to consider it.The lord Privy Seal suggested, that what was wanted, was an undertaking byGermany not to alter the territorial andpolitical status by force.One suggestion was that the point was sufficiently covered by paragraph 11.Another suggestion was that a reference should be made to the Pact of Paris;    butdoubts were expressed as to whether sucha reference would, be favourably received inGermany .mhe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said, that all his advisers at theForeign Office, whatever their general attitude towards Germany, were in favour of including Paragraph 8.   He wished, to placeon record, that if the Cabinet insiste1&quot; onomitting it they woul^ be closing theireyes to a matter of great importance.Another suggestion was to retain Para-graph 8 but to alter Paragraph 9.The Cabinet agreed that theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs, in consultation withthe Lord Privy Seal, should re-examine and, as far as necessary, re-draft paragraphs and 9 in the light of thedis cuss ion.
Paragraph 10 was approved.Paragraph,11 was a,proved subject to a minoramendment handed by the Lord President ofthe Council to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (viz., sub-para. 4, line 4,for the words &quot;whole settlement&quot; put &quot;general settlement&quot;.)Paragraph IS was criticised, by the lord privy Seal on the ground that it was a mistake to refer to &quot;the separation of theCovenant of the League of Nations from itsbasis in the Treaty of Versailles setting&quot;,which had been referred, to in the sameparagraph of the German proposals as thequestion of colonies.   To mention one. ofthese two items in this part of the Questionswithout the other was a mistake.   Admittedly,however, the Cabinet did. not wish to referspecifically to colonies, the only allusionto which was in the &quot;omnibus&quot; Paragraph 14.In the circumstances it was suggested thatthe matter referred to in Paragraph 12 should.also be dealt with in Paragraph 14.    Ifabsolutely necessary it might be referred totextually in some such manner as the following:There are other matters (e.g., someearly definition by the German Govern-ment of the phrase &quot;the separation of the Covenant of the League ofNations from its basis in the Treatyof Versailles setting&quot;) which willhave to be raised, at a later date, etc.In any event, however, it was suggestedthat the inclusion of this matter among theQuestions to which an answr-r was required.before a negotiation could be begun wasunsuitable.This proposal met with considerable support,and. the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to consider it.-9-
Paragraph 15 . The Lord President of theCouncil suggested that the first sub-paragraphof Paragraph 13 dealt too much with the purelylegal aspects .   what was required was to getcomplete understanding as to what the GermanGovernment meant by their proposals for theconstitution of a new International Court ofArbitration, in order that their relationto the existing Courts might be properlyappreciated.   Such agreement was necessaryto the pe? ce system of Europe.   He handed,the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs a draft passage on the subject.The Lord. President of the Councilcriticised the draft of the first line ofthe second sentence,  namely,  &quot;In view ofthe announcement of Germany&apos;s willingness to return to the League o^ Nations theGerman Government, will, no doubt, be willirgto indicate&quot; etc.   This seemed to suggest aslight doubt as to whether in fact theywould be willing to do so.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to consider these points.Paragraph 14, the penultimate line;    TheSecretary of State for Scotland suggested the word &quot;required&quot; instead of &quot;essential&quot;.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to consider the suggestion.The Cabinet agreed  that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should revise the draft in thelight of the discussion and of the various proposals handed to him, with a view toits despatch at the earliest possible moment .(The Secretary of State for Indialeft the Cabinet during the abovedis cussion.)
GERMANY.Proposed visit of a british minister .(previous reference:Cabinet 31(36),  Con-clusion 5.)4. The Cabinet were reminded of a proposal thathar&quot; been made at the Meeting referred, to in the marginthat in connection with the Questions to be addressedto the German Government (See preceding Conclusion)a British Minister might visit Berlin.After a short discussion the Cabinet a.greed.  That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should communicate the questions to Germany through His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Berlin, who would have to make certainexplanations and. who should be instructedto add. that if the German Governmentwould, like a British Minister to proceed,to Berlin in order to facilitate thenegotiations his  Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be glad, to send, one of their number, who, however, could, not be theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
O 0BROADCASTING.5, The Cabinet had before them once more theMinisterialResponsibility .Discussions inParliament.Report of their Committee on Broadcasting (C .P .-113(36)) .After hearing a statement by the Home secretary and a short discussion thereon, the Cabinet agreed -(previous reference cabinet 31(36), Con-clusion 2,)mo approve the two following proposalsof the Cabinet Committee:-(e)  Government Control and, rinisterialResponsibility..For the reasons set out on pages4 and 5 of our Report, we favour the continuance as at present bythe Postmaster-General of his existing functions and we are opposed, to the suggestion of theUllswater Committee that thePostmaster-General shoulr1 sharehis responsibility with a cabinet minister in the House of Commonsfree from heavy Departmental duties and preferably a senior member ofthe Government . .......cmeotlojrt,( i) Presentation, of Estimates of revenue and Expenditure.On the assumption that the duty of presenting estimates for broadcasting.dc as tingwill remain with the Postmaster-General, these estimates should be presented separately from the PostOffice estimates .2, whitehall Gar dens, S.H . 1,May 4, 193 6.
