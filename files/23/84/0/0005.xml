The Cabinet had before them a further re-draftof the Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin(CP.-127 (36)) revised by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in accordance with the Cabinet Conela-sions referred to in the margin.The revised draft was discussed paragraph by paragraph.Paragraph 6The suggestion was made to omitin the 10th line the following words:- &quot;free to deny its obliga-tion on the ground that that party&quot;,for the reason that the wordsquoted might be read as reflectingon German good faith.It was pointed, out, however,that any possible sting was removed by the last sentence of the para-graph .The Cabinet agreed that in the penultimate line for the word,&quot;invite&apos;&apos; should be substituted&quot;welcome&quot; .the woreParagraph 8.The suggestion was made that thefollowing words should be omitted from the ninth and tenth lines:-&quot;she recognises and. intends infuture to respect the&quot;.As an alternative it was suggested to omit only the words &quot;in future&quot;.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs accepted this, subject tothe result of consultation with his advisers .Paracr&quot;. ph 12 .    &quot;&quot;&quot;he Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs accepted a proposal by theLord. Privy Seal to invert the orderof the ideas put. forward, in thisparagraph:    that is to say, tobring in earlier the last sentence of the pnra.gra.ph.Subject to the above amendments,, the cabinet agreed.  To approve the revised, draft 0* theDespatch to T-Tis Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Berlin, circulated by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in hisNote of May % 1936 &apos; CP.-127 (36)).
FOREIGN POLICY. 2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign AffaireTelegram to the   handed round a draft of a telegram 1 Appendix I)Ambassador inBerlin re. he proposed to send to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in questions tothe German Berlin giving him instructions as to his procedure$bvernment.in presenting the Questions referred to in the previous(Previous Conclusion to the German Government.   He explained.Reference:Cabinet 34 that the first paragraph of the draft would have to be(36), Con-clusion 1.) amended, in accordance with Conclusion 1 above.3/^34^)3.        m^g seconr! paragraph was criticised, on the ground.that it might be interpreted, by His Majesty&apos;s Anbassa-dor as an instruction to press the German government at the very outset to give a real clarification of thedoubtful points in their peace proposals and. that this might lead to a sharp reply instead, of, or prior to,the desired invitation being given for a visit by aBritish Minister.One suggestion was that, instead of the phrase&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government expect a real clarification of all the doubtful points&quot; etc., might be put &quot;HisMajesty&apos;s Government hope ultimately to obtain a realclarification of all the doubtful points&quot;, etc.The Lord. President of the Council suggested thatthe second, paragraph should become the penultimatepara.graph of the telegram.&quot;he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed,to this.The Lord. President o-0 the Council also urged a modification of the wording in the third paragraph,so as to make clear that the visit of a british minister would take place only on an invitation fromthe German Government.&quot;he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also accepted this proposa!, and - stated that he would, amend the telegram so as to give discretion to His Majesty&apos;ambassador to make reference to a visit by a. british minister at the earliest convenient, stage in his negotiations.
Subject to the above amendments, the cabinet agreed  To approve the draft telegram.ii attached in Appendix I.(NOTE: A copy of the telegram asactually sent is attached as Appendix TI.)
FOREIGN POLICY.Germany.ProceduretowardsPrance andBelgium.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(36), Con-conclusion 2,)F.R. 3 4  4) 5:3 . The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs then raised the question of the procedure towardsFrance and Belgium in respect of the Questions toGermany.   He did not propose to publish the Telegramor the Despatch containing the Questions at present,but he was already being pressed, by the FrenchGovernment for a copy of the Questions, and, giventhe circumstances in which they had been produced, hethought it impossible to withhold them from theFrench and Belgian Governments after ,they had been communicated to the German Government.The Cabinet were reminded that the Questions\vould be certain to leak out after they had ^eenhanded, to the French Government.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be author-is ed to communicate the Questionsaddressed to the German Governmentto the French and Belgian Governmentsimmediately after they had. been presented to the German Government .
THE ITALO-ABYSSTNIANDISPUTE.Collect iveSecurity.PossibleReform of league ofNations .Sanctions.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(36), Con-elusion 4.)Eft. 36 (36)2..4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised certain questions resulting from the Italianvictory in Abyssinia on which he required decisions in connection with both the Parliamentary Debate thesame afternoon and the forthcoming Meetings at theLeague of Nations, where he would be in the Chair atthe Council.After a somewhat protracted discussion the cabinet agreed  (a) That in the Parliamentary Debate that afternoon, if pressed, as to the futureof the League of Nations, the secretary^ State for Foreign Affairs should, beauthorised, to say that it was too earlyfor him to make a statement that after-(b)(e)n^onourbe swiththe matter was fund aforeign policy and.tudied intensivelythe dominions :ntal to would, have toin consultationThat at theSecretary oLeague of Nations theState for Foreign affairs should be authorised, to say that as a consequence of recent events therewould, have to be a stock-taking of thepresent position of the Covenant.As this would probably have to beundertaken by the Assembly,by the Council, it would befor Governments to consider in the first instance. (Butand. not as wellthe mattersee below .)That it would be preferable for thesubject to be considered at the regularannual session of the Assembly inSeptember rather than at a special session:(d.) &quot;hat the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should examine whether it would*e possible and. desirable for the Councilof the League of Nations to appoint aCommittee to consider in advance a re-draftof the Covenant, instead, of leaving itto the regular Meetings of the Assembly,and report to the Cabinet Committee onForeign Policy:(e) That so far as the Italo-Abyssinianaffair was concerned, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should agree to join the French in making representations to Rome on the basisnotof the should, bepropos e&amp;)Treaty of 1906 5 but that he authorised, (as he himself to inform the French that  -e would make no joint approach to rome: that Italy ought now to tell the League what her proposals were forthe future of Abyssinia;   and. that the
more reasonable the Italians werethe better would be their eha.nce ofsecuring a removal of sanctions:(f) That so far as sanctions were con-cerned, the attitude of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (as he himself proposed)  in parliament should be to say that he wouldadvocate no new sanctions and thatthe future of existing sanctions wasa question for the League of nations to decide.   At the League he shouldnot take the initiative for a decisioneither to put on new sanctions or totake off existing sanctions.(The President of the Board ofTrade reminded the Cabinet ofthe heavy penalties that werefalling on British nationalsthrough the application of sanctions .)
ITALY ANDTHE YEMENAND SAUDIARAEIA .(PreviousP.reference &apos;Cabinet 20(34), Con-clusion 1.)F.R. 3^34) L.5. At the request of the Secretary of State forIndia, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to make enquiry as to whether there were anysigns that Italy, following her success in Abyssinia,had designs on the Yemen and. Saudi Arabia, with aview to securing a position on both sides of tne Red.Sea .In this connection the Cabinet were reminded thatthere was a satisfactory Treaty with the Yemen.
LOCARNO POWERS.Proposed Meetingat Geneva.(previous reference:Cabinet 88(36), Con-elusion 2 .)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed, the Cabinet that the Belgian Ambassador had approached him with a view to a meeting of the locarno Powers during the forthcoming Session atGeneva.   T-Ie had replied that he would, rather it did not take pi.ace .
AUSTRIA.Re-armamentof.(previous reference:Cabinet 24(35), Con-clusion 1.)7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had. been approached, asto the raising of the question of Austrian re-armamentat the forthcoming meetings at Geneva, but he deprecatedthe subject being raised.
.HB ANGLO-liGYPTIANPRE AT Y^negotiations.(previous Reference,I Cabinet 311(36), Con-1 elusion 6.)m8. The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-126 (36))reverting to the discussion referred to in the marginregarding the insertion of a time limit in the prospective Treaty with Egypt.     There was appended to the Memorandum a draft of two Clauses dealing (a)with British rights in the Canal Zone and (b) with the duration of the Treaty.      The principal issue turnedon the last sentence of the second Clause which readg-&quot;Ih case of the high contracting parties being unableto agree upon the terras of the revised Treaty, thedifference will be submitted to the Council of theLeague of Nations&quot;.      It was for the consideration ofthe Cabinet whether it was more advantageous, if theEgyptian Delegation refused to accept the Clausewithout the last sentence, to allow the negotiations to break on this point, or to secure a Treaty withthis last sentence.While several members of the Cabinet felt thatthe proposals of the Foreign Office might, on merits,place us in a better position at the end of twenty years than a Treaty limited, to twenty years, forthe reason that it would contain the EgyptianGovernmentr s recognition of our permanent interest-in the Suez Canal, it was pointed, out that themeaning of the proposals was not clear,    &quot;hey were intended to satisfy the Egyptians that their require-ments were met, and our own people that it was not asunsatisfactory as at first sight it appeared.    Itwould, be a very difficult matter to explain toParliament without causing difficulties with the egyptians.&quot;The Lord. Chancellor expressed doubts as to whetherthe proposals of the Foreign Office, in the Annex toC .P.-1S6 (36)), did. enable us to maintain our position-10-
after twenty years .    If the Egyptian Government didnot agree, we should have to take the matter to theCouncil of the League.    If the Council agreed, we shouldhave to accept their decision.    If the Council did not agree, he gathered that, the Foreign Office took theview that we should continue as before.    TJe did notthink that that was clear.    Neither would he like toassume the probability that the Council would be unanimous.   By that time several states Members ofthe Council might be hostile to ourselves .   &quot;heCouncil might even have been abolished,    ^he realissue, however, was as to whether we would&apos;agree thatin twenty years time we should be prepared to submitan interest, which was of vital importance to theBritish Empire, to some outside body.&quot;&quot;he Cabinet were reminded that the Dominions took a very strong view on this subject, which had beenventilated by the Deputy Prime Minister of Australiaat the last Meeting o^ the Committee of ImperialDefence.mhe Dominions&apos;  objections were likely to be statedpublicly, and this would react on the House of Commons.In the course of the discussion the general view was that, the House of Commons, in present circumstances,could not be induced to accept a settlement which appeared, to place, or would be represented as liable toplace,y  a matter of vital importance to Imperial communication ionsin the hands of the League of Nations or some otheroutside authority in twenty years&apos;  time.One suggestion was that if the Treaty was fortwenty years there was no reason why it should, not contain a clause r-cognising the importance of ourposition in regard to the Suez Canal:    but it wassuggested that, the Egyptians would, never accept theinclusion of such a clause .
After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed  That, a Cabinet Committee,  composed as follows  Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,Chancellor of the Exchequer,Lord Chancellor,T-Tom e Secretary,Minister- for Co-ordination ofDefence,Minister of Health  should, meet on the following day.,Thursday, May 7th, at 2.45 p.m.,to examine the Foreign office proposals:    to put this complicatedmatter in the simplest possiblelanguage;    and to make recommendations .ThemheTheTheTheThe(N,B.    The Home Secretary undertook,if time permitted, to prepare a document for the Committee&apos;sconsider at ion.)
RELATIONS 9.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theItflTE THEIRISH FREE Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP.-124 (36)),i STATE.raising the whole question of the present relationsbetween this country and the Irish Free State, and(previous references recommending the appointment of a United Kingdom HighCabinet 8&quot;)Eft 3*0^I (36), Con-El elusion b.Commissioner in Dublin and the opening of informal discussions between officials on both sides, with a viewto exploring the possibility of a general settlement.    Inthe view of the Secretary of State it would be an advantage4to have one comprehensive set of negotiations rather than to deal piecemeal with the position of the Grown,nationality, defence, the financial dispute, and other outstanding questions.     There would also be advantages in not embodying any new agreement in a formal Treaty,The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs proposed that his memorandum should be referred tothe Irish Situation Committee.     He suggested that the tentative proposals for a settlement of the financialdispute should be discussed between the Dominions Officeand the Treasury before being taken by the Committee.He also suggested that the memorandum on &quot;Coast Defencesin the Irish Free State&quot; (Appendix II to CP. 124(36))should be considered at an early date by the Committeeof Imoerial Defence.The Cabinet agreed;(a) That the memorandum by the Secretary(                                                   &apos; of State for Dominion affairs (CP. 124 (36)) should be referredto the Irish Situation Committee,(b) That the following Ministers shotild beadded to the Irish situation committee:-The Secretary of State for theColonies.The Minister for Co-Ordinationof Defence.The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries.
(c) That the proposals for a financial settlement in cp. 124 (36) should he discussed &quot;between the dominions office and the Treasury before being brought up at theCabinet Coirmiittee.(d) That the Committee of ImperialDefence should, at an earlydate, consider the report ofthe Chiefs of Staffs Committeeon &quot;Coast Defences in the IrishFree State&quot; (CP. 124 (36)Appendix II).(e) That the Dominions Office should confer as necessary with theBoard of Trade staff on aspectsof the question concerningthem.

Ill (36))drawing attention to the Resolution of the IndianLegislative Assembly demanding the denunciation ofthe Ottawa Agreement (a denunciation which wouldnot become effective until the expiration of sixmonths&apos;  notice), and to the Report of the SpecialTariff Board on the rates of duty on Lancashiregoods.The Cabinet agreed:That the next move should be leftto the Indian Government.
11. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-119 (36))asking for authority to announce the raising of the embargo on foreign participation in oil development in the Colonial Empire,      (The embargo did not applyto the Mandated Territories).      It was proposed,however, to make foreign participation subject infuture to the precise conditions set out in theMemorandum.The removal of the present restriction would,it was thought, be further evidence of the willingness of His Majesty&apos;s Government to remove any cause oflegitimate complaint regarding the freedom of access to Colonial raw materials.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposal of theSecretary of State for theColonies that foreignparticipation in oil development in the Colonial Empire should be permitted,  subject to theconditions px^oposed in his memorandum.(b) To take note, however, that theSecretary of State did not propose to make an announcement in the House of Commons on thesubject.

I leave to Your- Excellency&apos;s discretion todeciae at what moment such an indication could advantageouslyhe given with a view to furthering prospects of successfulnegotiation.      From our point of view what we want to avoidis that the German Government should return an unsatisfactoryanswer to our enquiries without hearing from a Minister,who had himself participated in the discussions here, the whole range of considerations we have had in view.Your Excellency will realise that though the GermanGovernment are not specifically asked for answers on certain of the points dealt with, His Majesty&apos;s Government will hope to obtain a clarification of all the doubtful points mentionedin paragraphs 6, 7 (first sentence), 8 (two separate points),9, 10 (six separate points), 11 (five separate points) and 12(before Germany&apos;s return to the League is discussed).I told the French Ambassador on 4th May that I did not intend to give to the French or any other Government a copy inadvance of our proposed communication to the German Government.Imuiediately after your interview wxth the Chancellor has takenplace you are authorised to give your French,    Belgian andItalian colleagues if they enquire a very general account ofwhat passed.      I will in due course myself give copies of yourcommunication to the French, Belgian and Italian Ambassadorshere.
