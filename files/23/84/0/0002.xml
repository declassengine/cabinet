THE LORD 1.      In the course of the discussion on thePRESIDENT of the COUNCIL. item which follows, the Prime Minister welcomed the Lord President of the Council on his return .froman absence through indisposition.
RECASTING. 2.    The Cabinet had &quot;before them the Report(CP.-113 (36)) of the Cabinet Committee appointedIjj^-ious to consider the Report of Lord Ullswater&apos;s CommitteeReference. .Cabinet 17 on the future of the broadcasting service afterelusion0?.) December 31st, 1936.      Broadly speaking, the Cabinetpr$ Committee had endorsed the opinion of the UllswaterCommittee that there should be no radical change inthe existing system.      It was proposed that the newCharter of the B.B.C. should be for a period of 10 years,and not 20 years as advocated by the Corporation itself.The postmaster General had to make a statement on the subject in the House of Commons later in the day,and Cabinet decisions were required on a large numberof points, affecting (a)  the relations between theCorporation and the Government, and (b) the Corporationsinternal administration.The Prime Minister said that after giving a gooddeal of consideration to the Report of the CabinetCommittee he had reached the conclusion that it would be unwise from a political point of view to give theHouse of Commons a detailed account of the Cabinet&apos;decision that afternoon.        Prom a Parliamentarypoint of view the occasion of a Motion to move the speaker out of the Chair on the Civil Estimates wasnot particularly appropriate.        The discussion onthe Post Office Estimates would provide a betteropportunity. In addition, the subject was anintricate one in wh...ch public opinion was much concerned, and the Cabinet ought not to feel compelledto take.a decision almost under duress that morningwhen there were many, other matters of great political
importance to be discussed.      Politically he thought awiser course would be for the Postmaster-Generals toinform the House of Commons that he welcomed the%bebateand that as the question was not one of Party politics,he would like to hear a free expression of opinionfrom Members of Parliament which would be of assistanceto the Cabinet in dealing with the new charter, for the-British Broadcasting Corporation.The postmaster-General had no objection to thecourse proposed by the prime Minister. .After discussion the Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the policy of the Government shouldnot be announced in the Debate that afternoon, but on the occasion of the debate on the postmaster-General&apos;ssalary which should not be deferred too long.(b) That the Postmaster-General should beauthorised to announce at such stage ofthe Debate as, in consultation with thePrime Minister, he might deem appropriate,that the Government would not announce their policy that day;    that the Govern--merit had already given prolongedconsideratiOil to the subject but would prefer to hear a full expression of theviews of Members of Parliament before taking their final decision;    and thathe would announce the Government&apos;s policyin the Debate on the Estimates of thePost Office.(c) That the Cabinet should resume discussion on the subject at a meeting to be heldon the following morning, Thursday,April 30th, at 10.0 ae.m.(d) That as soon as the Cabinet&apos;s decision was taken, the Prime Minister should invite the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury to arrange with the OppositionWhips for a Debate on the Estimates ofthe Post Office without undue delay.
AggMAN POLICYQuestions to beiaqCressed to the&apos; German Gove rnment,(Previous$ Reference:Cabinet 30(36)Conclusion 3.)3.        The Cabinet had before them thefollowing documents relating to Germany:-(l)   A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP, 1S1 (36.))covering two despatches from His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin, the first dealing with current German doctrine regarding expansionboth East and West, and the secondtransmitting a Memorandum by the military attache to the Embassy regarding theviews of the German General Staff on therecent crisis,(2)   A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (CP. 123 (36))covering the draft of a despatch to Berlinfor communication to Herr Hitler, asking for an elucidation of the following points in the recent German Memoranda:-(i)    the question whether Germany nowregards herself as possessed of&quot;complete equality&quot;.(ii)    the character of the non-aggressionpacts proposed by Germany, andtheir relationship with the LeagueCovenant.(iii)    the meaning of the phrases&quot;colonial equality of rights&quot; and&quot;the separation of the covenant of the League of Nations from theTreaty of Versailles&quot;.The Prime Minister pointed out that theproposed questions to Germany had only been circulated, late on the previous evening and he himself and probably some of his colleagues had not had time to study them.     He thought there must be adecent interval before this important question was discussed.The Cabinet agreed:That the questions to be &quot;addressedto the German Government * as setforth in CP.  123 (36),  should bediscussed at a special meeting ofthe Cabinet to be held on Thursday,the 30th April, at 10 a.m.      (See alsoConelusion 2(c))

The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 122 (36))covering a record of a conversation between Mr. LloydThomas (Paris) and the French Minister for ForeignAffairs.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made a brief statement to the Cabinet on some of theeffects likely to follow from the Italian triumphin Abyssinia with a view to obtaining their adviceat an early date.     One of the disturbing factors in the situation was that so much was incalculable.The Italian triumph was already reacting on thesituation in the Mediterranean.     Others could judgebetter than he as to the effect oM the black racesin Africa and on the situation in India.     Already atSairiae j-a, on the frontier between Abyssinia and theSudan, the Italians have concentrated a force thatwas much larger than our forces^/in the Sudan, whichwas likely to exercise considerable effect in that province.     There were also signs of a considerablereaction in Egypt from the Italian successes.     Hewould not like to say that Italy might not sooner or later attempt to take our place in Egypt.     They mightoffer, in the event of their taking our4 place, toadopt a more conciliatory attitude towards Egypt inregard to the Sudan than we could ever giveThe next point was the reaction of theItalian successes on Germany.     At first the ForeignOffice had anticipated that Signor Mussolini^successes would tend to check untoward developments in central Europe;, e.g, in Austria,      It looked, however,as if the opposite might be the case. -   There was some evidence that Herr Hitler was turning over in his
mind the possibility of a &quot;Putsch&quot; against Austria in orderto take advantage of Mussolini&apos;s pre-occupation elsewhere.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Pome reported, however, that inthat eventuality, Signer Mussolini would support austria and would expect France to assist him.     To this, he mustadd that there was an active Italian propaganda in Parissuggesting that British influence in the Mediterraneanwas declining,  that our sun was setting and the Italian  sunwas rising.     In this complicated situation, he would be glad if a Cabinet Committee could be appointed to assist him.There was to be a debate on Foreign Policy on -the followingTuesday and on Monday, the 11th May, the Coxincil of theLeague of Nations was to meet.      The Cabinet thereforeought to clear their minds before that time.The consequences of the Italian success were as yetonly beginning but appeared to be piling up rather seriouslyfor us.     Among the probable results were a re-orientationof the political situation in Europe;    a coming together ofthe Yugo-Slavs and the Germans and of the French and italians.     As an illustration of the complications, he pointed out that the French Government who had alwaysrefused to allow war material for Abyssinia to pass along the Djibouti railway, had now sent instructions to themanagement that if the Italians reached the railway theywere to yield to rorce majeure&apos; and allow the Italians touse it.      Sir Robert Vansittart was to see the french ambassador on the subject, basing his remarks on theassumption that France would co-operate.The First Lord of the Admiralty brought up thequestion of the concentration of the fleet in theMediterranean,     An Italian attack on the fleet now appearedextremely unlikely, more especially as recent telegrams from Paris indicated that France would on no account agree
to extended sanctions and would, with difficulty, hepersuaded to maintain the existing sanctions.Consequently, he suggested that the present concentration of the fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean was no longer necessary.     The fleet had done its &quot;best and had beenthoughout, the main support of sanctions  for the eight months it had been maintained in i is tant readiness forwar, which imposed a great strain on officers and men.All this time no night leave had been given.      the domestic economy of the Navy had been disorganised.There had been no leave, no reliefs and no re-commissioningof ships.     He asked, therefore, for some relaxation ofthe present position.     The fleet was always capableof extreme mobility.      In these circumstances, he wouldlike to tell the Commanders-in-Chief in the Mediterraneanthat the immediate danger of war was pas t  and could be discounted.     He would leave a representative  fleet in Alexandria but would like to bring some ships to Malta,and for the Home Fleet to return to this country.     Itwould be possible, of course., to adopt some minormovements of relaxation such as keeping the fleet at four days1notice, but this was hardly worth while and he would liketo-put the fleet at two or three weeks&apos; notice.     A littlelater, he warned the Cabinet that if the present situation was to be continued he might have to ask for some measureof mobilisation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsdemurred to taking these steps at this moment.     Itappeared probable that we were in for a long period ofstrain and it would create an unfavourable impression forus to withdraw the fleet at the very moment of Italy&apos;striumph.     Later in the meeting he said that he could not guarantee that Italy would not attack, our fleet.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out thatthere was another side of the question.     In the course of the
Staff Conversations with the French and Belgiums, it had become clear that the French were much alarmed at our general unpreparedness for war and more especially at theextent to which such forces as we had were locked up inthe Mediterranean and Egypt.     The longer our forcesremained concentrated in the Mediterranean, the more dangerous was the situation at home and the moreimpossible our relations with the French.In the course of the discussion, while muchsympathy was expressed at the difficulties of theAdmiralty, the view was strongly expressed that are-distribution of our forces at the present moment wouldbe disastrous.     It would be interpreted internationallyas tantamount to an admission that our policy had failed,that we were abandoning Abyssinia to her fate andwashing our hands of the whole affair.     It would makethe position of the Foreign Secretary impossible when theCouncil of the League met at Geneva and would have the worst possible effect on uninstructed opinion in thiscountry.      It was suggested that the dangers from publicopinion at home and abroad outweighed the very realdifficulties of the Admiralty.     It was pointed out that much would depend on what happened at the Geneva Meetings,particularly if the Italians occupied. Addis Ababa withinthe next few days and (as suggested in the telegram from paris No.4-2 (Saving) of the 28th April), issued a proclamation indicating that as the Italian objective had now been obtained, there was no further reason for continuing the war and Italy was ready for peace.      In that event, it might well happen that France would raise   &quot;sanctions.     Moreover, if Italy obtained the use of theDjibouti railv/ay, their main difficulties during the rainswould have been met.     It was strongly urged, therefore,
that no decision should be taken as to any majorre-distribution of the fleet until after the GenevaMeeting.     This, however, it was suggested need not standin the way of some relaxation to officers and men andsome departure from the present position of instantreadiness for war nor of unostentatious movements of ships,e.g. to and from Malta, such as the Admiralty suggestcarried out.After some further discussion the cabinet agreed:(a) 3Jhat the general question of our policy inregard to the Italo-Abyssinian disputeformed part of the general question of major foreign polic y    referred to inthe Conclusion which follows.(b) That, pending the Meetings at Genevaarranged to begin on the 11th May, no major re-distribution of the fleet shouldtake place, but that this decision shouldnot preclude some relaxation of the present state of instant readiness of the fleet at Alexandria nor unostentatious movements of ships such as the Admiralty had lately been carrying out, provided that these werenot on such a scale as to reflect on our foreign policy.(c) That the question of the position of the fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean should beconsidered by the Cabinet immediately afterthe conclusion of the Geneva meetings.

lORBIGN POLICY.eneral Review of.Jl)i^k:net Committeeippointed.I       Fg5.     Arising out of the discussion on thetwo preceding items, the Cabinet entered on a preliminary review of their general policy in thenew situation that was developing.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsformulated a number of questions that requiredconsideration.      The first set related to thefuture of the League.      could it survive the failureof sanctions to rescue Abyssinia?      If so, couldit survive in its present form?   Could it everimpose sanctions again?     Probably there had never been such a clear-cut case for sanctions.      If theLeague had failed in this case there could probablybe no confidence that it could succeed in the future.If the League was to be reformed, should this be linked up with Germany&apos;s re-entry?       Should it bemade clear that we ourselves, after the failurein the case of Italy, did not feel under any obligation to apply sanctions?The second set of questions related to theCommittee of Eighteen appointed to deal withsanctions.       Should it remove the present sanctions?The answer appeared to be in the negative.      should it maintain the present sanctions?    The answerappeared to be in the affirmative.      Should it add to the present economic sanctions,  and should itrecommend military sanctions?     It was unlikelythat the Committee would agree to either of thelatter proposals.       Without suggesting that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should themselves applysanctions, he pointed out that so far as theCovenant was concerned, there was nothing to prevent- 10 -
a Power making a demand on Italy and indicating that a refusal would involve certain action.A further set of questions related to theposition of the League on May 11th.      It would he ahumiliating one.       The United Kingdom would occupy the Chair.      The decisions would turn on our attitude.      Two possible alternatives were (i)while maintaining the present sanctions, to make clearthat we were not prepared to support Article XVIin the future, and (ii) to put all possible pressure on Italy notwithstanding the risks.As regards the future of the Council of theLeague, it must be remembered that It was likely toibe a good deal divided.      One group of nations wouldbe watching Germany;    a second group would bewatching Italy.      We alone were compelled to watchboth.      If we decided to cut out Article XVIwould we be surrendering Central Europe to Germany?He thought it improbable that British public opinion would be Willing to interfere in Austria, either insupport of one party which was bolstered -up by Mussolini, 4tp another party which was bolsteredup by Hitler.There were minor difficulties, for example,        .the case of two Maltese, British subjects, imprisonedin Tripoli for whom we could do nothing, and the  ^^f^V*Jquestion of what Mussolini intended to do with the1400,000 Italian soldiers concentrated in north-eastAfrica.       There had been telegrams to show that theTurkish Ghazi was also apprehensive on the latterscore.Another set of questions related to the German- 11 -
position.      Gould we secure more cordial relationswith Germany?       Should our questions to Germany pass through the diplomatic channel or he sent by the hand of a Minister?     Were we to go ahead with trying tonegotiate a new Locarno Treaty?     One of thedifficulties was that no two people felt alike onthese questions.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairswanted his questionnaire sent to Hitler not later than Monday next.       Finally, while recognising that this brought him on to rather controversial ground,he wanted the Cabinet to consider whether,there was apossibility of a detente between this country andGermany.The Prime Minister, notwithstanding his generalpoint of view which he had stated in public in favourof using the diplomatic channel rather than sendingMinisters to conduct negotiations abroad, inclined tothe view that there would be advantages in sending thequestions to the German Government by the hands of a minister, for the reason that the ordinary diplomatic channels hardly seemed to function in dealing withdictators.The Home Secretary, as a former foreign secretary, agreed in this view.      He thought herr hitler was susceptible to the personal touch.Some other members of the Cabinet took adifferent view.      They pointed out the effect of sending Ministers on these missions was to lower the prestige of the Diplomatic Service as a whole,and to weaken the position of the particularAmbassador concerned.        It was rare that good results- 12 -
had followed the visits of Ministers.     Moreover,the visit of a Minister to Berlin would encourage the Germans as to our attitude and re-awakenFrench suspicions and lack of confidence that was so important a feature in the present situation.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that a Minister can only go on such a mission once, and the question arose as to whethera Minister should take the questions with him orwhether the questions should he sent first andpossibly followed by a visit by a Minister.Several members of the Cabinet pointed outthat the general policy ought to be settled beforethe means by which it was to be carried out were discussed.        Our principal aim, it was suggested,at the present time was to play for time and for peace.       There was some reason to suppose thatGermany did not wish to make war on us now.Time was vital for the completion of our defensivesecurity.      The state of public opinion was such that the country wo-,ld not be willing to honour anycommitments unless these were vital to our security,which meant those of the Locarno type.      There was every advantage, therefore, it was suggested,in coming to terms with Hitler and fastening him downto keep the peace in the west.       Did it matter ifthe French said they could not rely on us?     Howfar could we rely on the French - in which connectionreference was made to what had been said earlier in the meeting about their attitude on theDjibouti railway.        In the long run French interests were bound up with our own, so our line should be to- 13 -
try and. obtain a detente with Germany.       This would beto follow for once a line that public opinion couldsupport.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence saidthat the course of the discussion impelled him to raise a matter that had lately been prominent in his mind.He had been feeling the urgency and difficulty of there-equipment programme and had been considering how far the assumption of &quot;peace conditions&quot; on which our presentpreparations were based, was compatible with the growinganxieties of the international situation.      In thisconnection he referred to the possibility mentioned by the First Lord of the Admiralty that if the fleet was to be kept much longer at concert pitch in theMediterranean, some measures of mobilisation might benecessary.      He quoted a warning of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs in the last paragraph of hiscovering note to the enclosures in CP.  121 (36) thatit was &quot;more than ever necessary to do all we can toincrease the tempo of our own re-equipment.&quot;He did not ask for a decision that day, but he warned the Cabinet that he might have to ask for authorityto adopt more drastic measures such, for example, as would enable manufacturers to give priority to government orders in connection with the Defence requirementsprogrammes, and to postpone commercial orders whether for home or foreign account.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, after recallinghis own reply to some observations by Mr. winston churchill in the House of Commons on this subject,asked that the Minister for Defence Co-Ordination&apos;s- 14 -
question should he reserved until after decisions hadbeen reached on the major policy of the Government.Meanwhile, it would be useful if the Minister couldinquire how far measures such as he had suggested would in fact increase the tempo of our defensive preparations.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence saidthat he had already begun some inquiries on this aspect of the question.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) That a Cabinet Committee composed asfollows:-The Prime Minister (in the Chair),The Lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,.The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for Home-Affairs,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Lord Privy Seal,The Minister for Defence Co-Ordination,should consider and report to the Cabineton the foreign policy to be adopted bythe Government in the present international situation.(b) That the question of whether somedeparture should be made from the decisionto aim at securing our Service needswithout interference with or reductionof production for civil and export trade(Defence Requirements Report, paragraph36, CP. 26 (36)) should be reserved until after the Cabinet had taken  itsmajor decisions on foreign policy.
SBTHE ANGLO-EGYPTIANTREATYNEGOTIATIONS.PresentPosition.(previous reference.Cabinet 30(36), Con-clusion b.)6.papers:The Cabinet had before them the following a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP.  112 (36)) setting out the course of Stages A, B and C of thenegotiations, and the present position.The offers made by Nahas pasha wereanalysed and the conclusion was reached that there was no chance of the negotia-tions succeeding unless a time limit wereassigned to the Treaty provisions dealingwith the stationing of British forces inthe Canal Zone and the alliance between this country and Egypt.A Note by the Secretary (CP.  118 (36))covering documents circxilated to theCommittee of Imperial Defence by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and by theForeign Office, dealing with the military aspects of the Treaty (Nos.  1225-B and1229-B), and with the inclusion of atime limit (No.  1228-B).A Note by the Secretary (CP.  115 (36))covering an extract from the draft Minutesof the 277th Meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence, at which the following conclusions had been reacheds-(a) That the retention of a british garrison on the Suez Canal andat or in the vicinity of Alexandriais essential.(b) That, provided we can secure theretention of British troops in alexandria and a satisfactory solution as regards time-limit,we should not insist on theretention of troops in Cairo.(c) That the arrangements for a time-limit as regards (i) Alexandria,(ii) the Suez Canal (which are notnecessarily the same)&apos; should be reserved for consideration by theCabinet in the light of thediscussion.The Prime Minister said he had presided at themeeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence and hethought that everyone had taken the view that the  -maintenance of our troops both in the Suez Canal andat Alexandria was of vital importance to the communica-tions of the Empire.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairscirculated a draft paragraph (Appendix) which had beenprepared in the Foreign Office in an attempt to find some means of protecting our position in the suez canal Zone after the duration of the Treaty.      Onedifficulty in accomplishing this was that in the previousdraft Treaties no attempt had been made to secure ourposition beyond the period of the Treaty.       He thoughtthat if oirposition was secured as proposed in this draft the League Council after the expiration of the Treatycould not conceivably say &quot;We   recognise that you havea special position in relation to the Suez Canal butwe do not think that support of that position necessitatesthe maintenance of troops for the purpose.&quot;The draft paragraphs at the end of the Appendixwere then considered.One criticism was that the assumption appeared tohave been made that the League of Nations would be unanimous.What would be the position, it was asked, if one or morenations (Italy, for example) did not agree and no decision could be reached by the Council of the League?     Thatquite probable position did not appear to be provided for.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence urgedthat before considering a formula the Cabinet should reach a decision as to whether or not it was determined tosecure our position on the Suez Canal and at Alexandria.If that was accepted,  a formula could be devised thoughit might be that the Egyptian Government would not accept it. If we were to be driven from one irreducibleminimum to another a decision to that effect had betterbe taken.       We were, however, about to agree to theevacuation of Cairo and not to insist on the retentionof forces at Helouan.
If now we were not going to insist on the maintenanceof our position on the Suez Canal and at Alexandriathere was room for all kinds of bargains.      The firstthing, however, was for the members of the Cabinet tobe honest with their own minds and to decide on whatwas their irreducible minimum.The view that the Cabinet ought to decide on their irreducibleminimum and stick to it was strongly supported.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout the difficulty that the draft treaties of 1928 and1930 did not provide for an irreducible minimum afterthe expiration of the treaty.        Sir Miles Lampson&apos;stelegrams mar&quot;e it clear that if we insisted on this andthere, was no provision for appeal in case of dispute toa third party after the treaty had been brought up forreconsideration by one of the parties,  the egyptian delegation would not agree to a Treaty.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence was somewhat surprised at the wording of the third conclusionof the Committee of Imperial Defence.        He had under-stood that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee coupledAlexandria with the Suez Canal as indispensable requirements.Why,  therefore, were they separated when it came to thequestion of a time-limit?The Secretary of State for War said that the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff had drawn attention tothe same point.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that it was quite conceivable that in the arrangementsfor a time-limit different provisions might be made forAlexandria from what was contemplated in the case of the suez Canal Zone.
In reply to a request for information as to whatwould he the effect on the treaty negotiations of the death of the King of Egypt, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that in the view of the ForeignOffice the situation would he adversely affected sincethe influence of the Crown in fixing up some form ofGovernment when the ordinary constitutional governmentsfailed would no longer he available.       He was. however,about to ask the High Commissioner for his appreciationon this subject.The Lord Chancellor recognised that if a treatycould be secured without falling below the irreducibleminimum of our requirements, it would be a great advantage as it would strengthen our juridical position for the future.        The first thing, however, was for theCabinet to make up its mind as to what was the ir-reducible minimum.      If the view of the Committee ofImperial Defence was accepted that the retention of aBritish garrison on the Suez Canal and at or in thevicinity of Alexandria was essential, it seemed clearthat we could not hand over the decision on such amatter to an outside body such as the League of Nations.This view was strongly supported and it was pointedonout that whatever view might be held/the value of theLeague of Nations as a deciding body to-day no-one couldpredict what would be the position in twenty years.    Itappeared, therefore, to be a dubious proposition toprovide for submission of a difference of opinion on aquestion vital to Imperial defence to the League on theexpiration of the treaty.In this connection the Cabinet were reminded thatthe Deputy Prime Minister of Australia had expressed
very strong views on this aspect of the question atthe meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence.Among suggestions for meeting the difficultywere the following(i)   That Clause (9) as proposed by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Appendix) should stand, but that clause (16) should disappear.(ii)    That the last sentence of Clause (l6),as proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Appendix), viz:the submission of a difference ofopinion to the League,   should be deleted,and that no provision should be madefor the possibility of the High ContractingParties being unable to agree.(iii)    That there should be a permanent treatyunless both sides agreed to negotiate an alternative, but that the Clauserelating to the Suez Canal (and Alexandria)should terminate at the end of 20 years.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out the objection that previous draft treatieshad all contained some provision of the kind.      Inthese circumstances he was assured that if theseproposals were omitted there would, be no treaty.The present proposals were at least an improvement on the present position.The view that provision for the submission of a difference of opinion on the terms of a revised treatyafter twenty years to the Council of the League ofNations or any other independent authority should be omitted was strongly supported.        It was pointed outthat an entire change had come over the situationsince the draft treaties of 1928 and 1930 owing tothe rise of Italy as a Mediterranean and North AfricanPower. It could be pointed out that, if the draft
treaty of 1928 had been concluded, we should be facedto-day with the most embarrassing possibility of itsreconsideration.       This showed how difficult it was to look even ten, much less twenty,  years ahead.      .Wewere making an immense concession to the Egyptians inoffering to withdraw from Cairo and Helouan and we ought to insist on their meeting us as regards the time-limit.        It was by no means general in a treaty of thiskind to provide for third-party arbitration in the eventof     disagreement,   and it would be infinitelypreferable to provide for the two parties to.come to-gether say two years before the expiration of the treatyif either party so desired. The surrender of Cairowould be very unacceptable to many members of the Houseof Commons, but neither our own people nor the dominions were likely to accept a situation which placed thedecision on the vital matter of Imperial defence in thehands of a third party at the end of twenty years.The ouestion was raised as to whether, if therewere no treaty, Egypt might become a Member of the Leagueof Nations, sign the Optional Clause and invoke it to challenge our position in Egypt6The Prime Minister asked the Lord Chancellor to look into this point.In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to a suggestion made by the Chiefs of Staff that onceour permanent right to protect the Suez Canal had beenaccepted &quot;there would not be the same objection tothe imposition of a time-limit as regards other military aspects of the treaty, with, perhaps, a reference tothe League of Nations in case of disagreement.&quot; (C. I.D.Paper No.  1228-B, paragraph 8.)-21-
This might give some satisfaction to Egypt.The Home Secretary urged that if the treaty was to lastas long as twenty years,  it should he possible to insist on a clause on the lines of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs draft Clause (9) (Appendix) without our being committed to an arbitration.      It would be quite a normal thing to have a treaty for twenty years without trying to provide for the future at the end ofthe treaty. He urged that Clause (9) should include a reference to the interest of the Dominions as wellas the United Kingdom in this question.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that provision might be made for the High Contracting Partiesto meet two years before the expiration of the treaty.The Cabinet agreed :-(i)    To approve the first two conclusions ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence,namely -(a) that the retention of a british garrison on the Suez Canal andat or in the vicinity of Alexandriais essential;(b) that provided we can secure theretention of British troops in alexandria and a satisfactory solution as regards time-limit,we should not insist on the re-tention of troops in Cairo.(ii)       That, so far as the time limit is concerned,the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should try to find some way of meeting the strong view of the Cabinet that on theexpiration of the Treaty we should not submit the vital needs of Imperial defence to thearbitrament of the League of Nations or any-other third party.

He had detained the Ajax (on passage to Alexandria) at Malta for this purpose.

NEXT MEETING 9.      The Prime Minister instructed the SecretaryOF THECABINET. to place the remaining items of the Agenda on the list of  items to he considered at the Meeting ofthe Cabinet to take place at 10 a,m. on the following day, Thursday the 30th April,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,29th April, 1936,
APPENDIX.The formulae suggested in paragraph 20 of thememorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(1232 B.)5 which are the same as those suggested in paragraph4 (l) and (2) of the letter which is the annex to that memorandum are shown inserted in the annexed Articles (9)and (16) of a draft Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and underlined,They have been inserted in these draft Articles in order tomake it easier to appreciate their effect.      It must be emphasised, however, that the draft Articles into whichthey have been inserted were prepared in 1933 and nevershown to the Egyptians.       The 1933 draft is not quite inaccordance with the present proposals for a treaty (which of course have never yet been worked up into a completedraft) and in the case of Article 9 in particular the partsnot underlined must be taken as an indication of thegeneral run of the Article rather than of its exact words.The 1933 draft has been chosen for this purpose as it iscloser to our present proposals than any of the otherprevious drafts.The most important of the two provisions is that inArticle 16,      This text has the result of establishing tworequirements permanently? (a) His Britannic Majesty&apos;s positionin relation to the Canal, and (b) the safety of His BritannicMajesty&apos;s communications through Egypt,      Under it, it is established that the new treaty which may replace the present one after the period of 2o years must provide for both thesetwo things.      Consequently if Egypt and the United Kingdomcannot agree about the terms of the new treaty and theCouncil of the League has to settle the new terms, the Councilof the League is obliged in any terms it proposes to make
provision for these two things.     Though theoretically theCouncil of the League might say that these two things didnot require British land or air forces in the Suez canal zone, it is thought politically so improbable as to be a negligible eventuality that a unanimous Council would sodecide against the United Kingdom when the United Kingdom waurging the contrary.     Further the First Sea Lord emphasised that naval action was the most important for the protectionof the Canal and the right to defend the Canal by naval action is secured indefinitely by this text and is not even subject to any revision by the Council of the League,except in so far as naval action may be dependent on theco-operation of land forces already stationed in the zonebefore the emergency arose.The position of His Britannic Majesty in relation tothe Canal is referred to in the formulae.      It is thoughtthat the formula proposed for Article 9 makes it clear thatthis position is that it falls to His Britannic majesty o maintain the security of the Canal abd the freedom of navigation therein (i.e. to have the rights given to turkey and Egypt by Article 9 of the Suez Canal Convention).FOREIGN OFFICE.28th April, 1936.Article 9... .
9.      His Majesty the King of Egypt, authorises His BritannicMajesty to maintain upon Egyptian territory, in localities in the vicinity of the Canal,  such forces as His BritannicMajesty considers necessary to ensure the protection ofthis artery of communication.      The presence of these forcesshall not constitute in any manner an occupation, and willin no way prejudice the sovereign rights of Egypt.      In viewof the position of His Britannic Majesty in relation&quot; to the suez Canal, His Majesty the King of Egypt recognises that HisBritannic Majesty may, through the Commanders of these forces,take all steps necessary for the maintenance of the security of,and of the freedom of navigation in the said Canal.The detailed arrangements for carrying into effect theprovisions of this Article are contained in the Annex hereto-.16.     At any time after the expiration of a period of twenty years from the coming into force of the treaty, the Highcontracting parties will, at the.request of either of them,enter into negotiations with a view to such revision of its terms by agreement between them as may be appropriate in thecircumstances as they then exist,  it being understood thatthe position of His Britannic Majesty in relation to the suez Canal and the continued maintenance and protection inall circumstances of the essential communications of HisBritannic Majesty shall be provided for in any revision ofthe present treaty.      In case of the high contracting partiesbeing   unable to agree upon the terms of the revised treaty,the difference will be submitted to the Council of theLeague of Nations.
