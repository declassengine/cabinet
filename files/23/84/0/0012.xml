mtrE ITALO-abyssinian dispute .Question of sanctions .(previous reference:Cabinet 40(35),  Con-clusion 5.)1, The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the dispute between Italy and abyssinia:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP .-1^1(35))  circulating copies of certainrecent Despatches from His Majesty&apos;representatives in Paris, Berlin and rome, regarding the question of themaintenance of sanctions against italy and the action to be taken atthe forthcoming meeting of the Councilof the Lea-gue at Geneva:A Note,by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs ( CP .-1^4 (36))circulating, in accordance with theConclusion mentioned in the margin,a Memorandum prepared in the ForeignOffice on the probable effect ofmaintaining sanctions:A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP .-157 (36)) pointing out the serious effect of the maintenanceof sanctions against Italy on british trade interests, especially the SouthWales coal trade, and importantancillary services such as shipping.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that at the meeting of the Cabinet referred toin the margin he had been asked to see the italian ambassador and. sound him as to whether signor mussolini would be willing to make a contribution towards a settlement by making a statement to theLeague on the lines of the statements he had already made to the British Press Correspondents.This he had done and he imderstood that theItalian Ambassador had asked to see the permanent under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that morning.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairshimself was personally not optimistic as to SignorMussolini1s probable reply. The announcement that morning of the appointment of Count Cianoas Italian Foreign Secretary did not inspire confidence.
The attention ofthe Cabinet was drawn to analternative suggestion that had been made at the meeting-referred to in the margin, namely, that signor mussolini even though unwilling to make a statement to the League of Nations might be prepared to make apronouncement to the publio opinion of the world.This suggestion,it wag recalled,had been supported bythe proposition that if Signor Mussolini made anannouncement to the League and sanctions were removedthat would look like a bargain, but that if apronouncement were made to the world that idea would notbe so marked. This proposal was supported bothon the ground mentioned above and for the reason thatit would be rather easier for Signor Mussolini.Some doubts were expressed as to whether such adeclaration would have much value. Mr, Pirow, theSouth African Minister for Defence for example, wasquoted as holding the view that a declaration to theworld would not be of any value in view of Italyrspast failings to carry out their obligations, but that the promise of/an annual report to the League of Nations showing thatdeclarations in regard to Abyssinia had been carriedout would be regarded by the world as of value.Although there was no tendency to place very muchconfidence in the reliability of any declarations thatmight be made, there was general agreement that adeclaration to the world at large would be useful in preparing the way for the raising of sanctions andfor saving the face of the League. It would be important, however, to avoid any impression of abargain by which in return for such a declaration bySignor Mussolini the League of Nations was to raisesanctions.
One suggestion was that instead of riskingan affront by asking Signor Mussolini for something which he might refuse, we should merely ask for aconfirmation of statements made by Signor Ivlussolini toa Representative of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, but it was felt that this would hardly meet the case as the interview having been given to only one Britishnewspaper it had not received full publicity here.A suggestion that the needs of the situation would be met by an announcement by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in Parliament concerninghis interview with the Italian Ambassador was alsode erne d insuffIc i ent*The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,though not Very optimistic as to the result ofan announcement by Signor Mussolini on the lines proposed, was willing to make the suggestion to theItalian Ambassador.The Lord President of the Council suggestedthat in doing so the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs might tell the Italian Ambassador that theCabinet did not attach very much value to a declaration made to a single British Newspaper, which was apt to be ignored by the remainder of the press andconsequently did not get much publicity, but thatthey would regard in a very different light a declaration made on some conspicuous occasion to the Governmentsof the world.In the course of the disou.scion reference wasmade to a report from the British Military Attacheto the effect that Italy was about to raise 45 newbattallions of black troops, and it was pointed out thatif this information were published in Rome it wouldhave a very grave reaction at Geneva.
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported a conversation he had had with the FrenchAmbassadors, particulars of which have been circulated. The French Government was unlikely to take any initiative at Geneva but was likelyto conform to our own attitude. In view ofthe line the French Ministers had taken before theywere in office this was about as much as could beexpected of them.The French Ambassador on the previous eveninghad suggested that the Prime Minister and Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should meet the &apos;corresponding French Ministers at Boulogne or else-where. He had replied that he did not see muchobject in such a meeting.       If the idea was to decide; any or  a     joint po 1 Lay to wards sanctions,he thought this inexpedient considering that fiftynations would be represented at the meeting of theAssembly of the League. He would prefer to meetthe F. ench Ministers at Geneva where they would arrive four days before the meeting of the Assembly,and if the Cabinet agreed he proposed to say thatto the French Ambassador the same evening. TheSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked thatno decision should be taken on the raising of sanctionsthat day. There was no immediate hurry owingto the postponement of the meeting of the Counciluntil June 26th, 1936. He proposed to circulate a memorandum. He himself was rather veeringtowards the view that if sanctions were to be removedthere was something to be said for our taking theinitiative.
The President of the Board of Trade said(a)    That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should he authorisedto suggest to the Italian ambassador that failing a statement to the Leagueof Nations, it voOJX bo hoi. ful IfSignor Mussolini would make a solemnstatement on some appropriate occasionaddressed to the nations of the worldon the lines of the  statements he hadalready made to certain newspapers *(h)    That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should he authorisedto inform the French Ambassador thatthe proprosed meeting of British andFrench Prime Ministers and foreign ministers did not coiunend itself toHis Majestyfs Government for thereasons given above, and that hewould prefer to meet his Frenchcolleagues at Geneva a few days beforethe meeting of the Assembly.(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should circulate tothe Cabinet,  if possible not later.  than Friday, June 12th, 1956, amemorandum containing his proposals as to the continuance or otherwise of sanctions on Italy.that the most unfortunatething would be to leavesanctions merely .to peterOUt 4The cabinet agreed
2 . In the course of the preceding discussion the Chancellor of the Exchequer took the opportunity-nity to warn his colleagues as to the unsatisfactorytrend of French finance.    Under various forms of pressure the Government apparently were unwilling to devaluate the Franc .    Consequently we must expect that before long they would have to impose restrictions on imports.mhe President o^* the Board of Trade said thatthe French attitude towards imports was already very unsatisfactory and that  the imposition offurther restrictions woul^ be very serious to ourtrad e .
rptTB ANGLO- 3.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byEGYPTIANTREATY NEGO- the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-165STATIONS.(36)) on the subject of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty(previous negotiations.Reference:Cabinet 40 As the above Memorandum had only been circulated(36), Con-clusion 4.) on the previous evening the Prime Minister thoughtf.K  - ^O3.  it premature to discuss it, and. the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs agreed.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a leading article in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper whichmight have unfortunate repercussions .   *The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he had made some enquiry as to the origin of thisarticle, which had been produced, without any official inspiration, by &quot;The Times&quot; SpecialCorrespondent just back from Egypt .It was suggested, that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should, warn &quot;The Times&quot; (and.other newspapers) as to the need, for caution inany expression of opinion on the Anglo-Egyptiannegotiations.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs asked, that, before a decision was taken, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs mightexplain the situation to the representatives ofthe Dominions now in London.The Cabinet agreed.  (a) To refer the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP .-156 (36)) to theCommittee on Anglo-EgyptianConversations:(b) That, in view of the great import-ance of the subjects to be considered,the Committee should, be strengthened.(NOTE:    As approved by the PrimeMinister after the Meeting,the Committee will now be composed, as follows:-
The Prime Minister (In the Chair)The Lord President of the council the Chancellor of the exchequer the Lord  Chancellornhe Home secretary the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Secretary of State for  V&quot;arThe Secretary of State for air the Secretary of State for the colonies the First Lord of the admiralty the Minister for Co-ord.ina.tion of defence the Minister of Health.)(c) That in the interval between the Commit tee&apos;ahaving arrived at its recommendations andthe decision of the Cabinet, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should endeavour to see the Representatives ofthe Dominions in London to explain thesituation.

The Secretary of State for the Coloniesexpressed his thanks to the Secretary of State forWar and the General Staff for their very promp action in reply to his requests for reinforcementsof the troops in Palestine.    The House of commons had taken his declaration of policy on the previous day very well, and he proposed to adhere to theline of that announcement.   He gave the Cabinet asummary of a letter he had received from the HighCommissioner giving a good deal of information asto the very   , satisfactory attitude of the FrenchConsul-General in Jerusalem and. of the ConsularBody generally, with the exception of the ItalianConsul-General.Some concern was expressed at the unsatisfactoryattitude of the Italian Consul-General, and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs indicatedhis willingness to look into the matter if anyactual evidence of improper activities could beproduced .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also informed, his colleagues that Nuri Pasha, of Iraq,had been to the Foreign Office on the previous day and. had. expressed, concern as to the growinganxiety of the Arab world, as the result of events in Palestine.    Up to now the Arabs had beensurprisingly quiet, but evidence was reaching theForeign Office of growing concern in Egypt andother Arab countries.The Secretary of State for India reported thathe had received information from India to theeffect that anxiety was growing in. the Punjab andthat Mohammedan newspapers in India were criticising
the pro-Zionist policy of His Majesty&apos;--! GovernmentThe situation was not serious, yet it ought to be watched.The Cabinet approved, generally the line taken by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies in his announcement in the *-Touse ofCommons on the previous day.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India (CP.-150 (35))pointing out that both he and. his predecessor had.always contemplated that, when Burma is separated,from India, there should be a. Secretaryship ofState for ^urma as well as for India, the twooffices being held, by the same person, an&quot;1 that asimilar arrangement should, be made for theParliamentary Under Secretaryship.   At&apos; the end ofhis Memorandum the Secretary of State suggested,that Parliament should know what was intended,before Estimates are presented next january*ary forthe Departments of the Secretary of State forIndia and the Secretary of State for Burma&apos;,    thatan announcement should, be made by the Prime Minister,in reply to a Private Notice Question, shortly before the Debate on the Commencement and. ; -Transitory Provisions Orders in Council for Indiaand. for Burma, thus affording Parliament an opportunity-nity of discussing the new arrangements during that Debate?    but that, as the proposal involved,the exercise of the Royal Prerogative, it should,be submitted to his  Majesty before an announcement was ma.de .The Secretary of State for India made astatement of the position on the lines of his memorandum.The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled thatthe proposals were in accordance with what had. been intended, during the negotiations .The Nome Secretary reminded the Cabinet thatthe question might be raised, as to the number ofSecretaries of State in the House of Commons.The position was that if a single Minister held the two offices the number of Secretaries of Statep.-
was reduced by one, and for this reason nolegislation would he necessary.The Cabinet agreed  - (a) To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for India:(b) That the announcement should bemade by the Prime Minister inreply to a Private Notice question as follows:-PRIVATE NOTICE QUESTION.To ask the Prime Minister what arrange-ments are proposed, to be made for ful-filling the responsibilities of HisMajesty&apos;s Government as laid down inthe Government of Burma Act?REPLY.The Government have come to the conclu-sion that following the separation of burma from India there should be aseparate Secretaryship of State for burma, and also a new office ofParliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Burma.For reasons of practical conveniencethe Secretaryship of State and Parlia-mentary Under-Secretaryship for Burmawill, for the present, be held by thesame persons as the Secretaryship ofState and. Parliamentary Under-Secr etaryshipfor India, and the Burma Office will be housed, in the India Office.
MEAT POLICY. 7.    The Cabinet had before them the following the Cattle documents on the subject of Meat Policy and theSubsidy .  Cattle Subsidy:-Report ofCabinet The Report of the Cabinet CommitteeCommittee. appointed at the Meeting mentionedin the margin (C.P.-152 (36)), atthe end of which the Committee(Previous summarised, their Conclusions and reference: Recommendations:Cabinet 39(36), Con- A Memorandum by the Minister of elusion 2.) Agriculture and. Fisheries (CP.-153esp /    /i.L\m (36))  in which he summed, up thefce (3*Oit*. views of the Secretary of State forScotland, and himself, after cons id. er-ation of the above-mentioned Conclu-sions, as follows:-(i) We consider that a. satisfactory scheme for the maintenance and.improvement of the United. KingdomLivestock Industry can be prepared,on the lines recommended, by the cattle Subsidy Committee of theCabinet:(ii)  If these recommendations are approved by the Cabinet, we askfor authority to prepare a shortinterim measure to provide foran extension of the existingsubsidy arrangements, without modification, from 31st Octobernext until such time as thelong-term proposals can be broughtinto operation, or until,  say,31st July, 1937, whichever is theearlier date:A Memorandum by. the President of theBoard, of Trade ( CP.-158 (36))commenting on the latter part of conclusion (2)  of the Report  (C.P.-152 (3 6))  and pointing out thedifficulties that the proposal would,involve from the point of view of thenegotiations with the Dominions and.Argentina.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, whose position at the Cabinet. Committee had. been reserved, by theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury, accepted, theReport of the Committee, which in his view had. showngreat discretion and wisdom.   Ue drew attention,however, to the suggestion in the Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP.-153(36), Para.6) that the terms and date of the public
announcement of the Government1^ intentions with regardto long-term legislation would need to be very carefully considered in relation to the progress of thenegotiations with the Argentine Government and theDominions, and that the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotlandproposed to consult with their colleagues on the Tradeand Agricultural Committee on these matters,In reply to the President of the Board of Trade,who desired an early meeting to discuss this matter,the Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was arrangingit for Friday next.The Home Secretary reported that he had communicated with the Government of Northern Ireland, whowere prepared to accept the proposals of the CabinetCommittee, so he was in a position to give their assentif this was desired.In the course of the discussion the two following questions were raised:-(l)    What guarantee was there that imports from theEmpire would not flood the British market?(S)    Would the subsidy reach the people for whom itwas intended?The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, inregard to question (l), stated that the answer to this andto the wider question of other possible breakdowns wasgiven in the President of the Board of Trade&apos;s Memorandum(CP. 158 (36)) as follows:-&quot;We have naturally always contemplated that inthe event of a breakdown of the InternationalMeat Conference the United Kingdom would be free to take whatever measures were necessaryto safeguard the situation.     We have, howeverrecognised that it was desirable to avoid making any express provision to this effect......&quot;This was by v/ay of comment upon Conclusion 2 of the lord chancellor&apos;s Committee.     He himself agreed with this view.Our policy should be to strengthen as much as possible theresponsibility of the International Meat Conference, so as not- 15 -
to encourage one party or the other to aim at a breakdown.   Any public statement, therefore,ought to be as guarded as possible.As regards the second question, while he was anxious that the benefit should go to the producers,he thought that this would have to be left to theworking out of the policy over a period of time.It would be very difficult to control the retailersbut he thought the producers could make thenecessary arrangements to obtain the benefit.Th.e Secretary of State for Scotland said hehad been making enquiries, and he was informed thatin Scotland the producers were obtaining thebenefit of the subsidy.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs agreed generally with the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries and the President of the Board ofTrade on the subject of meat imports from theEmpiree       He suggested that the InternationalMeat Conference might be given powers to punish any state breaking away.       Whatever course might be takenin the event of a breakdown, It would be necessaryto ensure that Dominion imports were regulated.The President of the Board of Trade said this applied to imports from the Argentine and othercountries also. It ought to be realised&apos;that a nation bringing about the failure of the whole scheme could not throw the whole responsibility back uponthi s country eThe Cabinet were reminded that they were agreeing toa scheme which would involve a subsidy until prices should reach a given level.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat the object of the scheme was to secure arise in prices, and he hoped that it would not continue for ever .The President of the Board of Trade could, see no sign that the scheme was likely to be broughtto an end by a permanent rise of prices to thelevel suggested.   The Cabinet, in adopting thescheme, must have their eyes open as to this.The Lord. President of the Council said thatthe farming community wer? basing themselves onthe assumption that the subsidy would continue indefinitely .The Cabinet agreed  (a)  ^o approve the Conclusions and.Recommendations summarised atthe end of the Report of theCabinet Committee (CP.-152 (36))as follows&apos;-(l)  vVe agree in recognising the greatobjections to subsidies of all kinds,and. we think that there is good, reasonfor the apprehensions felt by theTreasury that the continuance of a subsidy to the home producer of beefmay be invoked, as a precedent  forsubsidies to other branches of agri-culture or manufacturing industries .In view, however, of the exceptionalposition of the home industry at thepresent time we think that in all thecircumstances the continuance of thesubsidy can be justified in the caseof beef.    This should not, however,be regarded as in any way creating a precedent for similar treatment inthe case of any other product,  agri-cultural or industrial.(2) We agree with the Chancellor of theExchequer that he cannot reasonably be asked, to undertake the unlimitedliability of guaranteeing a fixedprice to the home beef producer, or
an indefinite liability towards thatproducer to be determined by someoutside body,   We think that in theevent of a collapse of prices due to,e .g,, a meat war, we should reserveliberty of action vis-a-vis Argentinaand the Dominions so as to enable usto take whatever measures may then bethought best to safeguard the home producer, for example, by prohibitionor restriction of import, excess levies,etc., and that it would not be right insuch an event to call upon the exchequer to bear the cost of indemnifying thehome producer,(3) The Treasury and the agricultural departments agree that if the pricerises above say 44/5 the exchequer subsidy should be reduced,    We concur in this view.    It will be for theDepartments concerned to work out theproposal in detail,(4) We agree that the subsidy should be soadjusted, as to encourage the productionof the best quality beef.    We also conaurin the view that the extra cost involvedin quality improvement and also in theefficiency measures (market research,centralised, slaughtering, publicity,etc .) should be met out of the fixedsubsidy(5)  In view of the fact that both theAgricultural Ministers have impressed upon us the great importance from thepoint o&quot; view of the maintenance ofthe industry of securing a return tothe home producer of 42/6 per cwt.,we are satisfied that a figure forthe subsidy approaching that, suggestedby them is in the circumstances  justi-fiable .   Accordingly we recommend, thatthe subsidy should be fixed at. 5,000,000 per annum, and. that theTreasury should, be protected agahnstfurther liability by the adoption ofthe various safeguards mentioned, inthe foregoing, paragraphs .(b) To approve the preparation of interimlegislation to provide for the perioduntil the long-term proposals should,be brought into operation, as set outin conclusion (ii) of the Memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture and.Fisheries (CP.-153 (36)).(c)    That Conclusion (a)&apos; (2) above shouldbe read in the light of thememorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP. 158 (36)).

ELECTRICITYDISTRIBUTIONReport ofthe McGowanCommittee.(previous reference:Cabinet 39(34),  Con-clusion 10.)8.      The Cabinet had before them a memorandum I.by the Minister of Transport (0 .P .-148 (36))covering the Report of the Committee on ElectricityDistribution, appointed last year, under theChairmanship of Sir Harry McGowan.   As a. resultof their review of the present &quot;complex and.chaotic structure of distribution&quot; the Committeehad. said that &quot;an improvement in the present organisation can and. must be effected.&quot; ,   The most-important features of the Committee&apos;s recommenda-tions were a.general scheme of reorganisation of distribution, and. their proposals for dealing withholding companies.   At the end of his memorandum the Minister of Transport recommended that theReport should, be published, as soon as possible,in advance of the Cabinet&apos;s consideration of any action which they might desire to take upon it,and that a Cabinet Committee should be appointed,to consider what legislative proposals dealingwith the distribution of electricity would bedesirable in the situation disclosed, by the Report,The Cabinet v/e re informed that thereport was likely to be very controversial fromthe point of view of local governments - socontroversial indeed that it might prove impossible to carry out its recommendations.The Cabinet agreed:(a)    That the Minister of transport should be axithorised to publish the report of theCommittee on ElectricityDistribution.
That before their next meeting,the Prime Minister should, seethe Minister of Transport and.suggest the composition and termsof reference of the px^posedCabinet Committee.(Note:    The President of the Boardof Trade ashed, that theParliamentary Secretary ofthe Mines Department shouldbe a member of theCommittee,)
gpIISH SHIPPING.acificijfe Soviet-Russijrevious[Reference:Cabinet 62 (53)f Conclusion 11)9.     In reply to a question regardinghis attitude towards the questions raisedrecently in the Press as to the future ofBritish shipping in the Pacific,  the Presidentof the Board of Trade said that hitherto hehad been very careful to make use of certainsentences used in a speech some time ago by theChancellor of the Exchequer.      The P. and 0.group were accusing him of having made noadvance in the last two years on the subject.His Department, however, had not without difficulty been collecting information on thesubject and had at last succeeded in doing so.He thought the best -plan was to send it to theImperial Shipping Committee.     Up to now,however, the Canadian Government had objected.As soon as their consent had been obtained,he proposed to refer the question to &quot;theImperial Shipping Committee, who would advise the Governments concerned as to Hie most appropriate action to be taken.     Until then,he Was opposed to any flat subsidy.In reply to a question aboutallegations that had appeared in the Press as tothe ignoring of British shipping by the SovietGovernment in its shipments of timber, etc.,from the Baltic and northern &quot;ports of Russia,the President of the Board of Tra.de said that last year British shipping had not done badlyso far as the Baltic trade was concerned.      Ifhe received information that they were not
getting their fair share of the shipping, hewould have to take the matter up with theSoviet Government.     The only information of that kind he had at present was in relation to the black Sea, where our shipping had been pushed outof the business.

During theWhitsuntide Recess he had continued these negotiations with Mr. Menzies, the CommonwealthAttorney-General, and had reached a very satisfactory agreement.       All now depended on whetherDoctor Earle Page could be induced to ratify theagreement as in that event the Commonwealth Governmentshould be counted on to accent it.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.10th June, 1935.
