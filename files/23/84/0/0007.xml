THE CORONATION. 1. The Lord President of the Council informed theCabinet that he had seen &quot;he King, who had given his(previous reference: approval for May 12th, 193 7, as the date for theCabinet 34(36), Con- Coronation,elusion 19 .)The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said.F.R. 30)^34)3.   that the Dominions were aware confidentially of theproposed change.   He understood, however, that hewould, not be authorised to inform them officiallyuntil after the decision had been taken in Council.The Lord President said that he wrould arrangematters with the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and that the meeting of the Council wouldprobably be on Thursday, May 28th, at 11.30 a,m.
THE ITALO- 2.   The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, ForeignABYSSINIANDISPUTE.   - Office, said he had spoken on the telephone to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, at Geneve.,(previous reference: who reported that matters had gone well on theCabinet 34(36), Con- previous day. &quot;here had been more Foreign Ministerselusion 4.)at the Council of the League than recently, and. theyF.R. 37/36)^/ were in a less depressed, state..   They were satisfiedthat, the decisions of the previous day had beenright ones.    &quot;he Secretary of State would be leavingGeneva on the morrow .-2-
ijt-te TmALO- 3 . The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled thatABYSS IN LANDISPTT^F . at the Meeting mentioned in the margin a decision asThe Fleet in     to the question of the Fleet in the Eastern Mediter-the Mediter-ranean. ranean had. been postponed until immediately after the geneva meeting.    That meeting was now concluding, and(previous reference: apparently the question of the sanctions on Italy had cabinet 31(35), Con-       been postponed, until June 15th.    This made matterselusion 4(c)) .very difficult for the Admiralty.    If the Fleet wasto be kept in the Mediterranean much longer it wouldhave to be reinforced, immediately to the extent of^,000 men.    This involved calling up pensioners whowere in employment.    The Admiralty had done vhat theycould towards giving soiie slight relief by degrees,but very little was possible in this direction.mhe Prime Minister said he proposed, to hold aMeeting of the Cabinet on the return of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.The Cabinet agreed  That a Meeting of the Cabinet shouldbe held on Monday next, May 18th, atwhich the question of the mediterranean fleet should, be considered .-o -
rpHTE ARGENTINE. 4.    The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, ForeignOffice, reported that the Foreign Office were getting(previous reference:      somewhat anxious about the attitude of the ArgentineCabinet 49(S3), Con-     Republic.    Owing to the gradual loss of the Britishelusion 1 .)market for their meat there was a risk that they mightF.B.. 5-7/36)2..&apos; turn to Germany for a market.    It was proposed to circulate a Memorandum to the Cabinet at an earlydate .
$EIGN 5. Enquiry was made as to why a decision had &quot;been ..policy.  taken at the end of the previous week to publish theaestionspressed Despatch to T-!is Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin settingthe Germanernrnent . forth the list of Questions to be addressed to germany as approved at the Meeting of the Cabinet referred, topreviousreference: in the margin.Cabinet 34(35), Con- The general impression left on the minds of elusion 3 ,)members of the Cabinet had been that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs did not intend to publishunless he could not avoid it, and. that publication would not take place unless a bad leakage occurred.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet of the record, of the previous Meeting, where it was statedthat the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&quot;did not propose to publish the telegramor the Despatch containing the questions at present, but he was already being pressed by the French Government for acopy of the Questions, and, given thecircumstances in which they had been produced, he thought it impossible to withhold them from the French and belgian governments after they had been communi-cated. to the German Government.The Cabinet were reminded that theQuestions would be certain to leakout after they had. been handed, to theFrench Government.&quot;No decision was recorded.The Cabinet were informed that shortly after tkedocument had been handed to the German, French and.Belgian Governments, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had received a report that a precisof the Despatch had. been published in Berlin.    In thecircumstances he had felt it unavoidable to publishat once.     He had communicated his intention to aMeeting of Ministers, informing them that thesituation was such that it would no longer be wise to withhold publication.
The Lord Privy Seal recalled that at the previous meeting referred to in the margin the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs had. accepted his proposalto invert the order of ideas put forward in Paragraph12 (Cabinet 34 (36), Conclusion 1) of the despatchreferred to above, but he noticed that the alteration had not been made in the Questions assent.The Cabinet were informed that the matter had. been one or urgency;    that the telegram had been sent to berlin before the record of the Cabinet Meeting was available;    that through an oversight this alterationhad. not been made;    that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had. consulted several of his colleagues on the subject and that they had agreed with him thatthe alteration was not one of sufficient importance tojustify withdrawing the Despatch from the GermanGovernment and substituting another.^here was general agreement that this was the correct view .(mhe Parliamentary Un^er-Secretary,Foreign Office, left the cabinet at this point.)
PALESTINE.Establishmentj,f a Legisla-&quot;tive Council.previous reference:Cabinet 35(35) , Con-clusion 2 .)6. The Cabinet resumed, their discussion on thesubject of the situation in Palestine,*begun at theMeeting mentioned in the margin, and. again had.before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (0.^.-132 (36)), together withColonial Office melegrams Nos .166 (35)  and 168 ^35)The Secretary of State for the Colonies made astatement to the Cabinet in which he recalled, thecourse of events .   T-Tis statement was brought up todate by reading a telegram he himself had sent tothe Nigh Commissioner in Palestine since the last meeting o^ the Cabinet , in which he had. pointed outthe objections to an announcement of a RoyalCommission, which, he had suggested, would convey to the outside world, an impression of capitulationby T-?is Majesty&apos; s Government to a threat of force .we then read, a reply just received, from the NighCommissioner, who adhered to his previous position.Roneo-ed copies were handed round, to the Cabinet .He added that the Zionists were not giving muchassistance-    T-Te had. recently learned, that they wereorganising a trip to Palestine by five Members ofParliament at the cost of the Zionist funds, and,notwithstanking his own efforts to dissuade theM.P.&apos;s concerned, they were due to start on the morrow.   Another factor in the situation was that dr. Weizmann was due in London in three days&apos;   time.In the meantime some of the leaders of the Zionist-movement in London, who had somehow or other gotnews of the proposal for a Royal Co,omission, were strongly urging that no decision should be taken until after Dr. Weizmann&apos;3 arrival and discussionwith him.   The Nigh Commissioner.; however, wasinsisting strongly on the urgency of the situationand the danger of delay in announcing a Royal
Commission, which might enable the Arab leaders tocall off the strike and the present unrest.While taking the view, as a matter of general principle, that it was better to follow the advice of the man on the spot, the Secretary of State forthe Colonies felt, some doubt as to whether, in allthe circumstances and particularly in view of hisown announcements about not capitulating to athrea.t of force, it would be wise to announce a royal Commission at the present time&quot;,    at any ratebefore seeing Dr. Weiamann.In the discussion it was urged, that a RoyaltCommission could not possibly be appointed, until lawand order had. been restored,    &quot;his was a fundamentalprinciple,    &quot;he situation, however, was already veryserious, possibly as bad as in the disturbances of1929.    As in that case, there would certainly be ademand for an authoritative Inquiry as soon asorder was restored.   The suggestion was made,therefore,  that an announcement, should be made tothe effect that the first task of the Government-would be to restore law and. order, but that after that so^e kind of an Inquiry would be undertaken.This met with general acceptance, subject to theHigh Commissioner&apos;s suggestion that it might be aswell to add to the Terms of Reference some such wordsas  &quot;consistently with the discharge of His Majesty&apos;sdual obligations under the Mandate&quot;, in order to reassure the apprehensions of those who feared thatan abandonment of the Mandate was contemplated.In supporting the above proposal the cabinet were influenced, by the fact that the High Commissionerstrongly advised, the appointment of a Royal commission as the best way of overcoming the dangers of thepresent situation and. that no other suggestion had.been made, apart from forcible repression.-&amp;-.
The question was then discussed as to whetherthe announcement should be made at once or whetherDr. Weizmann&apos;s arrival in London should, be awaited.In this connection the Cabinet took into account a statement in the &quot;Tigh Commissioner&apos;s telegram ofMay 12th that the Arabs would refuse payment of taxesafter May 15th, which therefore appeared, to be acritical date.The strong view of the Cabinet was that it would^e inadvisable to delay .    If it became known, as was inevitable, that there had. been consultation withdraw.   leizruann before the decision was taken and noconsultation with the Arab representatives (who werenot in London) then the good, effect anticipated bythe High Commissioner from the announcement would, beeomplet e ly d.is count ed .The Secretary of State for War informed theCabinet  that the Chief of the Imperial General staff was somewhat perturbed, at the effect of the courseof events in Palestine on the situation in the near east .    In Egypt the Treat;, negotiations were breakingdown and there was a risk o-p trouble.    There wasinformation that the Egyptians were in touch withSaudi Arabia, and the troubles in Palestine wereanother manifestation of a movement that might resultin a serious Moslem outbreak.mhe Secretary of State for India also expressedapprehensions as to the possible reactions of thesituation in Palestine on India, particularly ifforce had. to be used.    This would, be the more serious as the Government of India were relying largely onMoslem good, win in the working out of the reformsscheme.   T-Te had not, however, received any informationof a Moslem reaction.as yet.
Some doubts were expressed as to whether theArabs in Palestine would be satisfied by theappointment of a Royal Commission,     What the Arabswanted was action, and they might regard it as adevice for procrastination,3\ suggestion was made that rhe announcement mightrecall that an effort had been made for an Arab Delega^tion to be received in London, but that events had prevented the Arab Deputation from leaving Palestine.It was impossible, therefore, for His Majesty1 sGovernment to obtain a direct contact with the Arabs.171 o receive an Arab Delegation would be to hear theArab case.   To receive Dr. tfeizmann would.&apos;be to hear the Jewish case.    It might be explained that, a RoyalCommission would enable both parties to be heard.In the course of the above discussion the-Secretary of State for the Colonies read, to theCabinet a first draft of the Terms of Reference forthe proposed  Inquiry .&quot;he Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should send a telegram tothe TTigh Coinmissioner in Palestineinforming him that the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government was first to secure a restoration of law andorder in the mandated territory,after which some form of authori-tative and. independent Inquiry wouldhave to be undertaken:(b) That the TTigh Commissioner should beinformed, that His Majesty&apos;s government wished, the announcement to be madeas soon as possible, so as to avoid any suggestion that their policy hadbeen formulated after discussion with one only of the parties to the dispute,namely. Dr. //eizmann fas representingthe Jews) who was d ie in London in three days&apos;  time:(c) That the High Coimnissioner should be consulted as to the procedure and. formof the announcement, which, subject tohis agreement, it was thought might-take place simultaneously in Londonand Jerusalem:(d) That, in compliance with a request by   ,the Secretary of State for the Colonies,the following Ministers should meet thesame afternoon at 2,4^ p.m., in the
Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s room at the TTouse of Commons, to considerthe draft of the telegram to theTTigh Commissioner which the Secretaryof State for the Colonies undertook to prepare:-The Secretary of State for theColonies.^he Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Lord Chancellor (If available) .The Home Secretary (if available) .The Secretary of State for Air.mhe Secretary of State for DominionAffairs (If available):take note that the Prime minister would, see the Permanent Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in orderto ascertain whether there was any objection from the point of view ofthe Foreign Office to the course proposed.(MOTE:    The Prime Minister sawSir Robert Vansittartand ascertained thatthere was no such objec-tion..)
VERNAL HEALTTJ 7.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by-kvTCES INGOTLAND. the Secretary of State for Scotland (C.P.-128 (36))pension of. seeking authority to prepare and circulate to theCommittee of Home Affairs a Rill for the extension ofpreviousReferencet Maternal Health Services in Scotland, following theCabinet 14(36), Con- introduction of a Bill to improve the standard of(elusion 5 4) .domiciliary midwifery in England, and Wales.   AfterFK.32-(?0&apos;^- setting forth the main proposals of the Bill, whichdiffered in some respects from those incorporated inthe English Bill, the Memorandum stated that when theproposed arrangements were in full operation it was estimated that the total annual charge on theExchequer would not exceed  50,000, and. that after asufficient lapse of time the Exchequer contribution would be included in the block grant under the LocalGovernment (Scotland) Act, 1929.In reply to the Minister of Health, theSecretary of State for Scotland promised to do his utmost to avoid bringing in his Bill until the.Minister of Health&apos;s Bill had passed the Houoo of&apos;Qowaaofta-, since the scope of the latter was rather less ambitious and the introduction of the Scottish.Bill might lead to demands for extension.      TheSecretary of State&apos;s undertaking, however, was subject to the provision that he was very anxious toget his Bill during the present session.The Secretary of State for Scotland wasreminded that the mortality rate for maternity was much higher in Scotland than in England and there was muchground to believe that this is due to the difference inthe practice between the two countries;    in England,reliance being placed mainly on midwives, and in scotland on doctors.     He was asked not to include anything in the Scottish Bill which would tend to stereotype
this system.     The Secretary of State for Scotland wasalso ashed to hear in mind the special conditions ofthe Highlands and islands in this Bill, which he undertook to do.Subject to the above discussion, tie cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of State for scotland should prepare and circulate to theCommittee of Home Affairs a Bill for theExtension of Maternal Health services in Scotland.
