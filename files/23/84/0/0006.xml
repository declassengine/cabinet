I THE ANGLO-EGYPT IAN1 TREATY1 NEGOTIATIONS(previous reference:Cabinet 34(36), Con-clusion 8.)1 . The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Anglo-egyptian treaty negotiations the Report of the Cabinet Committee(CP.-129 (36)) appointed, at theMeeting mentioned, in the marginto consider the Foreign office proposals in CP.-126 (36)  dealingwith certain difficulties connected,with the insertion of a time-limit,which had. arisen during the negotia-tions .    The Cabinet Committee had examined the forms of provision for meeting the situation with which HisMajesty&apos;s Government was confronted,on the basis of a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (A.E.C.-2 - attachedto the Report) and. had. made recommend-ations (See Appendix).A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-131(36)) outlining the probableresults of a failure to secure aTreaty;    putting, forward, a. suggestion as to the Duration Article of theTreaty &apos;Article 16); and attachinga draft telegram to His Majesty&apos;sHigh Commissioner in Egypt .The Prime Minister informed, the Cabinet thatthe Parliamentary Hnder-Seeretary, Foreign Office,had. received a telegram from the Foreign Secretaryto the effect that, in view of the important issues involved, he wished to be present at the cabinet before a message was sent to the T-Tigh Commissioner;.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary said, that theEgyptian Government had been consulted, and the newPrime Minister had. agreed, to postpone the discussionof the Treaty until May 25th, although he had givenwarning as to the danger of too prolonged, a delay .The Prime Minister sai^ that in the circumstances he would, not try and reach final decisions today.The Home Secretary dre?  attention to his Notesetting forth succinctly the alternative forms whichthe provision about the Suez Canal might take,together with the comment to which the. form might give rise (CP.-129 (36)).   He explaine-&quot;1 the reasons
why the Cabinet Committee preferred the second ofthe three possible courses, namely, to keep to theidea of a Treaty to be made for twenty years, butthat the Treaty should contain a preamble or other appropriate provision by which Egypt recognised, thj^tthe special rights of his  Majesty&apos;s Government inrelation to the Suez Canal existed without time limit,.and that the twenty years provision on this subject should, be made as to the mode in which these rights would by agreement be expressed.    The Committee, he added, suggested, that their objects could be attained by adopting Clause 9 of the Annex to CP.-126 (36)and also the first part of Clause 16 of that Annex downto the words &quot;they then exist&quot;.^he Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, inthe course of the discussion, emphasised that theCommittee had. recommended the omission of the follow-ing passage       the original Article 16, viz.:-&quot;It being understood that the positionof T-Tis Majesty&apos; ? Government in relationto the Suez Canal and the continued,maintenance and protection in all circumstances of the essential commu-nications of His Britannic Majestyshall be provided for in any revisionof the present Treaty&quot;,for the reason that they contemplated its insertionprominently elsewhere in the Treaty; for example,  ina preamble.    If this were placed in its proper positionin the Treat;.,  it woul^ make clear that our claim was for all time .The Cabinet were urged that the first point to insist on was the minimum on which they were preparedto stand, even, if necessary, to the point of a breakdown of the negotiations,   vvhen this wasdecided, the phraseology should not prove insurmount-able.    It was recalle-&quot;, however, that trie languagewould, have to be sufficiently definite to satisfyParliament in this country, and the more definite
1 ?1it was the harder it would be for the egyptian government to accept.The suggestion was made that the draft Article 9might not. prove sufficiently definite to secure ourclaims at the end of the twenty years .    It began by stating that -&quot;His Majesty the Xing of Egypt authorisesT-fis Britannic Majesty to maintain uponEgyptian territory, in localities inthe vicinity of the Canal, such forces as his  Majesty&apos;s Government considers necessary to secure the protection ofthis artery of communication......&quot;It seemed possible that the ring of Egypt mightwithdraw that authority after twenty years .    Similarly,in regard to the last paragraph, where the Xing ofEgypt was to recognise our right to take steps necessary for the maintenance of the security, etc.,of the Canal, the Xing of Egypt might withdraw thatrecognit ion.this, however, it was pointed out, would, be safeguarded by the proposal that the preamble should contain an emphatic admission of our claim.^he Cabinet were reminded that our legal positionin Egypt was that under the Treaty of Versailles weha&apos;&quot;1 succeeded, to ^turkey&apos; s rights in respect of theSue&apos;7. Canal:    that i? to say,  if Egypt was unable toprotect the Canal and. appealed for assistance, Turkeyformerly, and we today, were boun^ to assist.    that position, however, was not altogether satisfactory, asEgypt might, state that they were able to safeguard the canal aif make no appeal to us.    If we stated that our right was solely inherited from Turkey the position intwenty years&apos;  time might not be very satisfactory ifEgypt said, we had no right to remain on the Canal.This aspect had. never been raised in Parliament or else?here, hut it rendered1 it advisable that some wayshould, be found by which the recognition of our rightsby the Xing of Egypt should be in perpetuity.
There appeared to be a large measure of agreement that a Treaty concluded for twenty years which did. not provide for a recognition of our claims during thatperiod, and. thereafter would, not be satisfactory:    alsothat at the present time neither Parliament nor theDominions would accept a provision permitting referenceto the League of Nations at the end of twenty years.A good deal of discussion took place on the proposal of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs inC.P.-131 (36), paragraph 4. that in place of a referenceto the Council of the League of Nations in the DurationArticle of the Treaty, provision should be made that any dispute at the end. of twenty years should, at therequest of either party, be referred to a ConciliationCommission constituted in accordance with Articles 5and. 6 of the General Act for the Pacific Settlement ofInternational Disputes, of 20th September, 1928.mhe conclusions of such a Conciliation Commission, itwas pointed, out, were recommendations only, having nobinding force upon either party.   Moreover, each ofthe parties woul^ have a representative on the Commission,which would consist of five members.It was suggested that if we proposed a provisionof this kind, in the present Trea.ty it would be difficult for a Government, even after the lapse of twenty years,to refuse to carry out the recommendations.    The scopeof the Conciliation Commission&apos;s recommendations,however, as the Cabinet were reminded, would not beve^y large if the preamble to the Treaty contained, anadequate recognition of our claims.    There was, however,the possibility that while the Conciliation commission might recognise our right to the security of the suez canal, they might decide that the efficiency of theEgyptian forces was such that there was no need forBritish forces within the Suez Canal zone,    ^he only
The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said he had discussed the question briefly withthe Ghief of the Imperial General Staff who had informed him that it was true that in 1919 therewere in Egypt 5 Divisions and a Cavalry Divisionhut that owing to the fact that demobilisation   -f 9 rwas in progress there were actually only the       1 fj ;jequivalent of two mobilised Divisions availabe,The troops now in Egypt would suffice to deal withan ordinary outbreak but if it became necessary toassume control and to rule in face of a hostileEgypt at least one more Division would be requiredaiid this would mean mobilisation.
safeguard against this was the presence of a british representative on the Commission.It was suggested, that in such a case the BritishGovernment might .well be entitled to say that theydid not agree with the Conciliation Commission and could not accept its recommendation.The Cabinet were reminded that the egyptian government might very possibly reject the proposedrecognition in the preamble of our claims as to thesecurity of the Suez Canal, in which case the Treatymight break down.The Cabinet were also reminded that even if agreement, could, be reached on these very difficultMilitary Clauses, the Treaty was liable to break down(as it did in 1930) on the question of the Sudan.Would it not be possible, it was asked, before reaching final agreement on the Military Clauses, todiscuss the question of the Sudan?    ^he difficulty ofthis appeared to be that we ourselves had suggestedtaking the Military Clauses first.Some discussion took place as to the dangers of abrea.k-d.own of the ^treaty negotiations.    They were informed that in the disturbances of 1919 five.infantry divisions and. one Cavalry Division had been required.Q?he Minister for Co^ordinatJon of Defpneehad discussed the question briefly with the GJrfTef ofthe  Imperial General Staff and had ascertained that infact two Divisions had sett\e^Ca% question in 1919,though the men happene^d^to be available for more divisions.    two-*Oivisions shoul^ suffice on thepresent-occasion, but if the trouble was on a large^^^^^The Prime Minister said, that the Chief of theImperial Genera.1 Staff had been in attendance inthe next room, but as no decisions were to be taken that day he had dispensed with his presence.

The difficulty ofthis appeared, to be that we ourselves had suggestedtaking the Military Clauses first.Some discussion took place as to the dangers of a break-down of the treaty negotiations.    They were informed, that, in the disturbances of 1919 five- infantry divisions and. one Cavalry Division had. been required .The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said he had discussed the question &quot;briefly withthe Ghief of the Imperial General Staff who had informed him that it was true that in 1919 therewere in Egypt 5 Divisions and a Cavalry Divisionbut that owing to the fact that demobilisation   ^ 9 rwas in progress there were actually only the       i dJequivalent of tv/o mobilised Divisions availabe.The troops now in Egypt would suffice to deal withan ordinary outbreak but if it became necessary toassume control and to rule in face of a hostileEgypt at least one more Division would be required and this would mean mobilisation.The Prime Minister said. that the Chief of theImperial General Staff had been in attendance inthe next room, but as no decisions were to be taken that day he had. dispensed with his presence.
He himself would prefer that the military aspect-should be discussed, so far as necessary, in thefollowing week, when the Secretary of State for iVarwould he present.The Cabinet were also. reminded of the difficulties with .which we should be confronted in Egypt if theTreaty broke down and. we could, not get an egyptian government to carry on.    Owing to the small number ofBritish officials now in Egypt we had. no machinery for conducting the administration of the country.   Therewas also the possibility that if the present treaty negotiations failed, souie later British government might  conclude a worse Treaty than was now eontem-plated.The Lord President of the Council thought it mightbe worth while to take some risk.    If, during thenext twenty years, we obtained a close Treatyrelationship and. won the confidence of the egyptian government and. people, we might be able to reach aposition where the Egyptians woul* be very glad forus to remain.    It had. to be remembered that thepresent Egyptian Government did not regard, ourpropose&quot;1 concessions as concessions at all, but merely as the recognition of their legitimatesovereignty .The Secretary of State -for Dominion Affairs said,that the proposal to substitute a ConciliationCommission for the League of Nations in the time-limit Article of the Treaty would not, he thought,entirely remove Dominion opposition, but might go some way to satisfy then..The question was raised as to whether, ifinstructions were given to the Nigh Commissioner inEgypt on the lines o^ the present discussion, hewould be tol&apos;&quot; to adhere to them up to the point of
an actual breach of Treaty negotiations, or whetherthe Cabinet would be consulted, again before a final&quot;Tie Prime Minister said that according to general practice the Cabinet would have an opportunity of considering the matter before there was a final break.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone further discussion until after the return o^ the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs from Geneva,when it 7/as hoped that the Secretaryof State for War would also be present:(b) That in the meantime the Foreign office should, revise the various documents inthe light of the discussion, and moreparticularly on the basis o&quot; G.P.-131Commission) :(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be asked to considerthe proposal that the question of theSudan should, be taken up before themilitary part of the Treaty was finally settled.break.
A w 0ks^INE. 2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byablishment       the Secretary of State for the Colonies (C.P.-132a Legislativenoil. (36)) stating that, in view of the disturbed conditionsin Palestine there was now little prospect of the Arabj-previous reference: Delegation coxuing to London to state their case, and cabinet 28IfS), Con- that the High Commissioner recommended that the mostelusion 6.)helpful means now open to T-!is Majesty&apos;s Governmentof presenting the present disorder from spreading and increasing in violence would be for an immediate announcement to be made of the appointment of a RoyalCommission with wide Terms of Reference, with powertto make recommendations for lessening animosities andfor establishing a feeling of lasting security inPalestine.The Secretary of State for the Colonies made astatement to the Cabinet in the course of which heread a telegram he had. just received, from the HighCommissioner in Palestine, in which he mentioned that the situation was now more serious than it hadbeen in the disturbances of 1929, and that theappointment of a Royal Commission might save thesituation.   We did not ask for a decision on theTerms of Reference to, or composition of, the proposedRoya.1 Commission, which would require careful  consider-ation, but merely for permission to tell the rTighCommissioner that. His Majesty&apos;s Government was favourable to the proposal, so that, he could sound the Arabs and report, further.    It would be very important to avoid any suggestion that, the RoyalCormnission would, have authority to reconsider theMandate, as that would create a. very serious situation.&quot;he Cabinet were reminded that any coimminicationby the &quot;Tigh Commissioner of Palestine, either to therepresentatives of the Arabs or the Jews, would at once
leak out and. serious trouble night be caused.Several members of the Cabinet asked that adecision might not be taken until they had. had. anopportunity to see an-&apos; discuss a draft of the Termsof Reference,    ^hey ought to know what were to bethe Terms of Reference and have some idea of the personnel of the Royal Commission before deciding the principle.The Cabinet agreed  (a.) That the question of a RoyalCommission should, be postponed,until their next regular weekly meeting on Wednesday, May 13th:(b) Tha-t in the interim the Secretaryof State for the Colonies should consider the Terms of reference and. invite the T-Tigh Commissioner&apos;sideas on that subject.2, Whitehall Gardens. 3.7.1.May 11, 193 r..
1^ appendix.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN CONVERSATIONS COMMITTEERECOMMENDATIONS.i) Having regard inter alia to the grave objections, both from the point of viewof the Dominions and of public opinionat home,  there would be thegreatest difficulty in persuadingParliament to accept any provisions inthe Treaty which v/ould, at the end ofa fixed period, invest the Council ofthe League of Nations or some outsidebody, with the power to decide thenumber of troops which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should maintain in the canal zone in order to render our imperial communications safe, in the event ofEgypt and the United Kingdom being unable to agree.i) Of the three forms of provision which wehave considered, Form B appeared to be theonly acceptable one.     From, the point ofview of British interests it probably represents the irreducible minimum.      The objectsin view can best be attained by adoptingClause 9 of the Annex to cp. 126 (36)and also the first part of Clause 16 ofthat annex down to the words &quot;they thenexist&quot;o      The Clauses would accordinglyread as follows5-Clause 9.&quot;His Majesty the King of Egypt authorisesHis Britannic Majesty to maintain uponEgyptian territory, in localities in thevicinity of the Canal,  such forces as HisBritannic Majesty considers necessary toensure the protection of this artery ofcommunication.      The present of these forces shall not constitute in any manneran occupation, and will in no say prejudice the sovereign rights of Egypt.      in view ofthe position of His Britannic Majesty inrelation to the Suez Canal, His majesty the King of Egypt recognises that HisBritannic Majesty may, through the commanders of these forces, take all steps necessary for the maintenance of thesecurity of, and of the- freedom of navigation in, the said Canal.The detailed arrangements for carryinginto effect the provisions of this Articleare contained in the Annex hereto.&quot;
Clause 16.11 At any time after the expiration of aperiod of twenty years from the cominginto force of the treaty, the highcontracting parties will, at the requestof either of them, enter into negotia-tions with a view to such revision ofits terms &quot;by agreement between them asmay be appropriate in the circumstances as they then exist,&quot;
