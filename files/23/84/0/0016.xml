mSISTANCE. The New draft regulations.^previousiRefe fence;icabinet 441(36)).1. The Cabinet resumed, their consideration of theReport (CP.-172 (36))  of the Committee on theRegulations of the Unemployment Assistance Board,which was begun at the previous Meeting earlier inthe dajr *The President of the Board of Education saidthat in as much as he had. been very much concernedwith the original Regulations, he felt someresponsibility for the difficult situation withwhich the Minister of Labour and the Cabinet were now confronted.      The position was, in his opinion,one of extreme gravity, in which a false step mighthave far-reaching and. disastrous consequences.He was very apprehensive of the proposals asthey now stood.   He agreed, that it was quite impossible to conciliate Socialist opposition,but that did not alarm him.    It was not the Socialistopposition, but the number and. s;ize of the cutsinvolved in the original Regulations wrhich had upsetreasonable public opinion throughout the country and.forced the Government to change their plans.    In his view it was imperative that the new regulations should, reserve the general approval of the Govern-ment&apos;s supporters inside and. outside Parliament.If a number of the Government&apos;s supporters in theHouse of Commons voted against the new Regulationsit would, be impossible for the Government to deal effectively with the situation which would, follow the bringing into operation of the Regulations,namely, widespread disturbances and. possibly riotingin the districts most heavily affected.    In fact theposition might be so grave as possibly to get outof control.
He agreed that the new Regulations were in many respects generous, and that if they were improved,they might he criticised as extravagant;    hut thiswas the inescapeable consequence of attempting tosecure uniformity throughout the country.   He there-fore would like to see the whole matter reconsideredafresh, and. in particular that, the possibility ofdifferentiating between the distressed and. otherarras should, be re-examined.    It would, be a mistake to suppose that even under the new Regulations allscandals and abuses would necessarily cease.The Home Secretary had said that before intro-ducing the new Regulations the Government must make sure that there were no &quot;hidden snags&quot; such as had.wrrecked the original Regulations.    Apart, however,from one or two matters of detail, there was onlyone fundamentally important piece of information which the Government had. not in their possessioneighteen months ago, and that was the number and.size of the cuts which the Regulations would, haveimposed, and how the cuts would be distributedthroughout the country.    This most material informa-tion was still lacking, and. the Government did. not know what the effect of the new Regulations was goingto be over the whole country as regards the number ofthe cuts, the Size of those cuts and. how they would:be distributed geographically.    It was true that theSecretary of State for Scotland had obtained, somesample figures showing the general effect of thenew Regulations in certain Scottish areas.    Thesefigures were very disquieting.    But what the cabinet should know was what the effect was going to be inSouth wales, Durham, parts of Lancashire and otherdistressed, areas .   He recognised the force of the
argument that,  for the reasons which&apos; the Ministerof Labour had given, any estimates of the ultimateeffect of the new Regulations must&quot; be misleading.But while this might be so in the case of acomparatively small number, he doubted whether thearguments were valid, when applied to a number suchas 600,000.    Surely in such a number the factors to which the Minister of Labour had referred wouldcancel themselves out, and the broad general effect would remain, even though individuals and. theircircumstances altered.   He thought, therefore, thatit should be possible for the Boar^ to produce thekind of estimates to which he had referred;    and. inany case he was sure that their production was highly desirable and, indeed, essential before any finaldecision could be taken.The first task of the Minister of Labour would,be to satisfy the House of Commons.    As soon as thenew Regulations were published, every Member ofParliament would, go to his constituency and. wouldsnon ascertain the precise effect of the new regulations on his constituency.    He would, thenreturn and vote in aecordanee with what he had.ascertained..    In present circumstances the Govern-ment had no idea, at all of what the ultimate effectof the new Regulations was going to be, and. it-followed that the Government could not know in advancehow their supporters were going to vote in the T-Touseof Commons .In the country, attention would be directed, tothe number and. size of the cuts and their distribu-tion.    It seemed that about 2^0,000 persons would,suffer cuts and. that, these mainly resided in the distressed areas .   He did. not think that publicopinion would, sympathise with a defence based on the
plea that most op the people affected were in the distressed areas where the administration of theILoeal Authorities had, as a rule, been extravagant.Public opinion would be likely to say that SouthWales was a hard-hit area through no fault of its own,it was not suffering from &quot;Poplarism&quot;, and the extra-vagance of its Local Authorities was due to a genuined.e?ire to maintain the standard of life of their people in South Wales and not (as in Poplar) to advertisethe benefits of their political opinions .   ^e did. notRelieve that the Government would have public opinionbehind them in support of a policy which would havethe effect of taking possibly as much as   1,000,000a year from South Wales unless indeed that policy could, be accompanied by some largr measures designedto relieve unemployment.T-Te din not think, therefore, that it was possibleto proceed without first obtaining the figures towhich he had referred, and without also deciding theextent, to which it might be politically possible tomake cuts.    In the past the possibility of havingregional scales had. been examined, and he agreed, thatthe difficulties had. been found to be very greatindeed.    Night it not, however,  be possible to havean arrangement o&quot; this kind limited to the case of single men with a scale rate of from. 15/- to 17/-,the exact amount of the allowance to be dependenton the recommendation of the local Advisory Committeeconcerned?Another important matter was how far the Governmentshould, allow the Unemployment Assistance Board to override the recommendations of the local AdvisoryCommittees.   T-*e feared, that if the Board was givenoverriding powers the value and. influence of the local
He thought that the local Advisory Committees shouldhave a wide discretion within certsin limits, end should not he subject to the overriding powers ofthe Bo.&quot;rd unless those limits were transgressed,,As regards the new rent rule, he thought thatthe case would be met if a provision was inserted,either in the White Paper or in the new Regulations,which would make it impossible for the Roard torefuse to accept the recommendations of the localAdvisory Committees except in cases which were clearly indefensible*The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries had raised a most important point in regard to the scaleallowances of adolescents and juveniles.      Publicopinion was interested in questions of nutrition,etc., and it was very difficult to represent that anadolescent or juvenile required less food than anadult.      This was a matter which he was sure required,reconsideration.He did not think that Members of Parliament would regard the new earnings rule as fulfilling the pledgeswhich they had given at the Election.    He urged thatthe earnings rule should be made more generous.    Inparticular he could see no justification at all fordiscriminating in the rule against the younger appli-cants.      Why should the household be fined 2/- becausethe wage earner was 20 and not 21?      It was also dis-appointing that the fourth category (Other Members)should be left to the discretion of the Board.    It wouldbe much better to provide in the Regulations that &quot;theother members&quot; should be treated as boarders.In conclusion, the President of the Board ofEducation urged that the Government should know much
more precisely than they did at present what difficultiesthey had got to meet and how far reasonable public opinioncould be persuaded to support them in solving the problem.A decision should then be taken in the light of all thefacts and with full knowledge of all the consequences.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said thathe was not a member of the Committee, and had only had avery short time in which to examine the proposals con-tained in the very formidable Report (CP. 172 (36)).The Cabinet should remember the psychological situationin Parliament and in the Country.      It had been generally known that for many weeks negotiations had been going onbetween the Minister of Labour, the Secretary of State forScotland,  and the Unemployment Assistance Board, and thatthere had been very great delay in formulating new regulations.      Next to foreign policy, this was thesubject which excited the greatest popular interest,  andthe proposals, when published, would be subjected to the-closest scrutiny and must be such that the Governmentcould satisfactorily defend in Parliament and on the platform.He was very much impressed with the points whichthe President of the Board of Education had made in regardto the distressed areas.    The lot of an isolated unemployedman in an area like London, where unemployment was practically non existent, was fundamentally different fromthat of the great masses of unemployed men in the distress-ed areas.    Any proposals based on uniform&apos; scales for thewhole country would mean f very heavy fall in the purchas-ing power of those areas.    This would affect, not onlythe households concerned, but the local shop-keepers andmany other persons.j
Having proceeded, so far, how could the situationbest now &quot;be eased?     He himself concentrated on the pledge which had been given at Seaham by the lord president of the Council during the General election in regard to the earnings rule.      (He thought that the rent position had been fairly met by the new rent rule).He was not quite clear how the earnings rule would workout, and drew attention to the differences set out onpage 11 of U.A.R.(34)  8 between the allowances under thepresent Regulations and those under the proposals.      Hewould very much like to see how the new proposalslooked in the form of an actual Regulation.    In effect the Board&apos;s answer to his question about discriminatingbetween the over 21 and under 21 wage earner was that the objection to treating both alike was based on principle.He (the Secretary of State for the Colonies) had equallystrong objection in principle to the view taken by theBoard.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether theSecretary of State&apos;s objection in principle to differen-tiating between over and under 21 applied also to thescale.The Secretary of State for the Colonies replied inthe negative.      There was all the difference between anunemployed child living at home with an employed parent,and the converse case of an employed adolescent orjuvenile living at home with an unemployed parent.The case against this particular provision of the earnings rule was that it tended to break up the family and drivethe child from home.The Minister of Labour pointed out that the samedifferentiation was made in the case of Health and unemployment Insurance.
The Home Secretary doubted whether a principle couldbe based on these examples.    Both in Health and Unemploy-ment Insurance the juvenile received smaller benefitsbecause he made smaller contributions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that theSecretary of State had based his argument originally onthe undesirability of too large a reduction being made inthe amount which the adolescent or juvenile Could retainout of his wages.    It now appeared, however, that the argument was based rather on the needs of the elderlyunemployed parent,.The Secretary of State for the Colonies observed thatif the child left home, both he and his parents whileliving separate, would each enjoy more money.The Secretary of State for Scotland had urged thatthe first 14/- should be raised to 17/- plus half the excess, with a minimum allowance of SO/-, in respect ofcases of 18 years and over.      Was there any magic in the14/-?The Minister of Labour explained that the cost ofthis change was out of all proportion to the importanceof the issue involved^    In this connection it was very desirable to remember the practice under the present regulations,    There was no such thing as a firm earnings rule throughout the country, because the circumstancesdiffered in every locality.    He had tried to meet thepoints raised by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,For example, the household had been narrowed down tothose of common tired,      A married son with dependantsliving with an applicant would, unless his earnings were very high, be regarded as contributing no more to the household than he would reasonably be expected to payif he and his dependants were boarders.     A comparison
of the new earnings rule with the existing rule showed that in every respect the position had teen greatly improved.      In particular It should he remembered thatthe proposals set out on page 11 of U.A.R.   (34) 8 hadbeen modified in favour of applicants as indicated inparagraph 7 of CP. 172 (36).     He had been asked at theprevious Meeting for&apos; an estimate of the additional cost ofthe Secretary of state proposal.     If the proposal wasto make the rule 14/- plus half the excess with a minimum of 20/- from the age of 18 instead of 21, the figure wouldbe  250,000 per annum and, without a minimum of 20/**, thecost would be  200,000 per annum.The Secretary of State for the Colonies urgedthat this was a matter on which there was much public anxiety, and he hoped that the Cabinet would be ableto ease the position, for example, by raising the 14/-to, say 15/- or 16/-, and differentiating at 18 insteadof 21.The Secretary of State for Air enquired whether,if this was done, it would mean a reduction in the cuts of a large number of persons, or would it only affectcomparatively few individuals?The Minister of Labour said that examination had shown that the change would not greatly affect the numberof cuts as distinct from the amount of the cuts.The Secretary of State for the Colonies was sure that the Government would be pressed on this point in viewparticularly of the pledge which had been given &quot;to maintainthe unity of family life&quot;.      It was necessary to considerfrom the political point of view whether the Governmentcould hope to get their proposals accepted by Parliament.In regard to single men in lodgings, theposition would certainly be compared with the 1931
crisis figure.      He, personally, would like to seethe figure fixed at 16/-, as he was certain that assoon as it was pointed out that even under the 1931cut these applicants received 15/3d., it would healmost impossible to defend a regulation prescribing15/-.The Minister of Labour hoped that the cabinet would not give a single man in lodgings a penny morethan was necessary.      The position was now entirely different from what it had been in 1931.      In 1931 itwas impossible to offer such men the opportunity oftraining, and still less the chance of getting workwhen they were trained.     Now such men could be offeredtraining and an almost certain chance of employment.Recently it had been reported to him in Sunderland thattraining for a semi-skilled job had been offered to 973single men under 35 years of age and only 92 had acceptedthe offer.      When the facts became known there was considerable local comment on the apparent indispositionof these young men to fit themselves for work.     As he hadalready explained,  the new Regulations were designed tohelp the elderly persons and persons with families but without resources.      It was very misleading to talk as though 15/- would be the rate over the whole field for single men in lodgings:    it would in fact only beapplied strictly in the case of men under 25.      He was sure that public opinion would feel very strongly that so long as single men could get 17/- they would notvolunteer for work.The President of the Board of Education pointedout with reference to the 973 Sunderland men mentioned bythe Minister of Labour, that the annex to the Commit tee&apos;sReport showed that in Sunderland only 120 single men under25 lived in lodgings, and that the rest lived at home.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout that the expenses of a single man in lodgingswere probably higher than those of a single man livingat home.    He fully appreciated the points made bythe Minister of Labour, but still thought, that theGovernment would have to face very great trouble inthis particular matter.The First Lord, of the Admiralty informed, theCabinet that he had had. no opportunity to consider this question.,T1he Lord. Privy Seal did not wish to make any contribution to the discussion.mhe Minister for Co-ordina.t ion of Defence saidthat he regretted, that the earnings rule had. not beenput on a different footing.    He would like to see anunmarried son or daughter living at home treated inexactly the same way as a married son or daughterwith dependants, living at home.    no treat theunmarried son or daughter as proposed in the newRegulation seemed inconsistent with the pledge &quot;tomaintain the unity of family life&quot;.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded theCabinet that these words had. been very carefullychosen at  the time, and that it was very important toavoid, paraphrasing them and. so extending their meaningand. scope.The Minister for Go-ordination of Defence, con-tinuing, said, he entirely disagreed, with the view thatthe Government should, make further concessions inorder to buy off possible trouble.   T-!e was not prepare&quot;1to admit, that because the internal situation in Franceand Belgium was disturbed we should follow the example of those countries and. make concessions not on their merits but. to escape clamour and. unrest .    The Govern-ment were under an obligation to see that destitute
30 96 dpeople did not starve and were able to live decently.If the Committee were satisfied that the new Regala-tions would secure these desiderata he thought thatthe Cabinet should accept the new Regulations and stand,up to any eri^ icis.a and trouble.The Lord Chancellor shared, the views just expressedby the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.    In thismatter trouble was inevitable, and. the Governmentshould satisfy themselves that their proposa-ls werehumane and fair, and, if so, they should, stand, upon them whatever the consecmenc^s might be.   TIe did. not feel competent to discuss details, but he was quite prepared to accept the views of the Cabinet Committee,which had. exhauptively examined the whole subject,that the allowances and. other provisions in the new regulations were adequate and. satisfactory.It could, not possibly be said, that the new Re gala-&apos;t ions were not generous.    They were to cost  ^00,000per annum more than the existing expenditure, and.there would be substantial savings on the existingexpenditure as a. result of the termination of theabuses and scandals.    These savings, plus the  500,000per annum, showed, how very generous the new Regulationswere.   Moreover, the fact, that, in about half the casesthe applicants were receiving allowances under thepresent Regulations and not under transitional paymentsalso showed that the figures were on the generous side.It was most important that the Government should,discourage the idea that  it might be profitable to abstain from taking work.    This applied, particularlyin the case o** the rural ar*&apos;:as, where in existingcircumstances we were very near the danger point.An agricultural worker with several children could, nowget more from public assistance than he could, earn in
wages.      When reference was made to the global effectof the cuts in South Wales, what was really meant wasthat the whole of the rest of the country should bebrought up to the extravagant and illegal practicesof the Authorities in South Wales.      This would simplymean the unnecessary expenditure of many millions ayear, and the encouragement over a wide field of all those who preferred a dole to employment.In reply to the point made earlier in the day by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, theMinister of Labour said that any attempt to dissect thescale and pick out individual items was unfair:the scale must be looked at as a whole.      While itwas true that for a man and wife the scale gave 24/-as a basis,  it must be remembered that in the case ofa man and a wife with no resources the benefit rate would be applicable.      This would cover a third ofall the cases.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that he felt very great sympathy with the point madeby the President of the Board of Education on theabsence of any figures showing the ultimate effect ofthe cuts.     Even if only rough and ready estimatescould be prepared they would serve a useful purpose,though he quite appreciated the Minister of Labour&apos;swarning that mere mathematical calculations without regard to other considerations might be misleading.In regard to the position of adolescents andjuveniles under the new Regulations he shared the
apprehensions which had been expressed by othermembers of the Cabinet.    He agreed that it was qaiteimpossible to satisfy either the Labour ov the LiberalOpposition,    ^he Government would have to facetremendous uproar and. possibly serious unrest.    what he did fear, however, was very serious opposition from the Government&apos;s own supporters, as had happened,eighteen months ago, when the Government&apos;s policyha.d had to be changed, not because of any action taken by the Opposition but because of the failureof the Government&apos;s supporters to approve theproposals.   Much the same thing had. happened inregard, to the Goal Mines -Bill, and. he did. not thinkthat the new proposals removed the danger of thishappening again.    Prom the political point of view he thought  that it would certainly be easier to getthe new proposals through Parliament than it would,have been to have got the original proposals through.The new proposals were s great improvement on theexisting Regulations&apos;, but the Government&apos;s supporters would compare them, not with the existing Regulations,but with the existing practice, and in particular they would want to know the total percentage of the cuts, the number o&quot; people involved, amd. how those people were distributed .    ^he only available figures were certain sample Scottish figures, and he thoughtthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer had. made a very strong point when he had. compared the effect  in the twelve Scottish areas of the Secretary of State for .Scotland.&apos; s own proposals with the effect of the new regulations.    Even so, the Secretary of State&quot;sproposals showed an appreciable improvement, on thenew Regulations, and. even this slight difference would,help the Government in Parliament.   &quot;Te did. not think
that it would be possible to withhold from the publicfigures of the ultimate effect of the new Regulations.Members would get the experts in their constituencies toproduce the figures for them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that theScottish examples were not cases where cuts would necessarily be suffered, but were cases where cuts night be suffered.The Minister of Labour repeated that a mere mathematicalcalculation would be grossly misleading and would serve no useful purpose.       Exact figures could only be given inthe grossly excessive cases and in the cases of single menunder 25.The President of the Board of Education asked why-exact figures could only be given in these cases?The Minister of Labour replied that these cases would bedealt with in the first few weeks, and all the data inregard to them were known.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, continuing,said that the Government^ supporters would ask for thafigures to which he had referred, and, what was much moreimportant, would seek information as to the amount of the cuts in individual cases.       No-one would defend the grosslyextravagant cases, but quite apart from these there would be heavy cuts in many cases in certain areas:-   for example,the new earnings rule would mean heavy reductions as comparedwith the existing practice in a large part of industrialScotland.       He would strongly support the proposal of theSecretary of State for Scotland to substitute 17/- for 14/-in proposal (ill).       He also supported those members of theCabinet who&apos; had urged that there should be no discrimination in the case of wage-earners under 21.       Under the present&apos;practice in industrial Scotland no such discrimination nowtook place, and to make this important change would cause serious trouble in the constituencies.    His experience whenrepresenting an English constituency also showed that thisparticular matter was a real grievance.
He agreed generally with the views of the Presidentof the Board of Education in regard to single menin lodgings, end hoped that the discretion should he so worded as to prevent single men in the Glasgowarea/being cut to 15/-.      The 1931 figure would he aflag for the Opposition and would make endlessdifficulties for the Government&apos;s supporters.It was, in his view,  imperative that there shouldhe no repetition of the situation of 18 months&apos;  agowhen the Governments loyal supporters had foundthat they could not endorse the proposals.      he recognised that the new proposals were a great improvement on the existing Regulations, hut hesincerely hoped that it would he found possible toimprove them still further.The Prime Minister suggested that the cabinet should adjourn at this point.    If any members ofthe Cabinet wished for further figures or other information they should communicate with the Ministerof Labour, who would obtain them, either fromhis Department or from the Unemployment assistance board.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer wouldforthwith convey to the Board the difficulties anddoubts which had been expressed,  and would obtainthe Board&apos;s observations thereon.      It might be helpful if two representatives of the Boardattended when the Cabinet resumed their consider-ation of the problem.Emphasis was laid on the urgent need for theCabinet to reach their decisions with the least possible delay.
was agreed : -(l) That the Cabinet should meet at no. 10, Downing Street, on Monday,June 39th, 1936, at 11 a,m., forfurther consideration of the Reportof the Committee on the regulations of the Unemployment Assistance Board.(2) To taice note that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer would convey to theBoard the views which had been expressed, and to request them toarrange for the-attendance of two members of the Board at the Meetingof the Cabinet on June 39th.(3) That any Member of  the Cabinet wishingfor further figures or other inform-ation, should communicate with theMinister of Labour.In accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;instructions the discussion has beenfully recorded.
