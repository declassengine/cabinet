In p-mTHE GOALMINES BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 3 7(36),  Con-elusion 1.)F.K. 39(34)13.1 . Tlie President of the Board, of Trade raised,the present position in regard to the Coal mines bill as a m8-tter of urgency.   He reminded. theCabinet of the difficulties that had been encountered.in Parliament, which had. been temporarily overcome by an undertaking by the Prime Minister to give an extra d^y for its discussion and by promising that, a white Paper should, be circulated before the Debatewas resumed..   As the White Paper was a matter ofgreat political importance he suggested that itshould be referred to the Coal Committee of theCabinet .    In reply to a question he sa.id that  the draftsman of the Bill and. the parliamentary secretary to the mreasury were considering whetherthe best plan might not. be to withdraw the present bill and to introduce a new Bill.In the course of a short discussion it was stated, that coalowners who normally supported theGovernment were unwilling to support this Bill,and doubts were expressed as to whether the scheme that was to be presented in the   /bite Paper would secure acceptance.   Further, it \vas ^eporte&quot;1 thatdoubts were being, expressed as to whether a. bill was really necessary and urgent.   What so^e Membersof Parliament were asking was why, if compulsion wasnot to be imposed for two years, a Bill should benecessary now, and they wished to be informed on thissubject ..  Some mine-owners were reported to be sayingthat amalgamation poulf not, be carried out until asettlement was reached, as to the unification of leases, an- that,  from this point o^ view thequestion of royalties ought  to be dealt with first.
The Cabinet agreed  &quot;hat the Coal Mines Bill should be referred to the Coal Committee for examination of the whole situation,particularly in its political aspects, in consult ation with theParliamentary Secretary to theTreasury, with a view to a reportto the Cabinet.(NOTE: Prime Minister has decided to add. two members to the Coal Commit-tee. which will now be composed asfollows:-The President of the Board of ^v&amp;de(In the Chair),The Lord Chancellor,mhe &quot;Tome Secretary35,The Minister of Labour^The Minister of r-Tealth*,The Financial Secretary to theTreasury,The Secretary for Vines.yt   Added by the Prime Minister.)
foR^TGW POLICYstionscaressed toghe Germanoveminent.I previousMReference :l:: cabinet 3 61(36)) .  12.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,referring to the Conclusions mentioned in the margin,explained, the reasons for his decision to publish theQuestions addressed, to the German Government.   news had. reached him of tendencious leakages in Berlin.TJe had. felt convinced that it was dangerous to allowthese to continue over the week-end, ^ore particularly as the leakages in Berlin were likely to he followed,by further tendencious leakages in the French Press,as it had been necessary to communicate the questions to the French Government.    No harm had been done bythe publication, and the German Foreign Minister had.not raised objections.    Had further leakages takenplace it was probable that, the British Press would,have taken sides in the question, whereas the reso.ltof the publication had. been to secure the support ofthe whole British Press to the Government .The Prime Minister added that,  though regrettable,there had been no alternative to immediate publication.This view was accepted by the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reportedthat the latest telegrams from -bis Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Berlin indicated that the German Chancellor was anxious to avoid, committing himself at the moment .T-Te had obviously been impressed by Signor Mussolini&apos;ssuccess in Abyssinia.   TJe would, reply when it  suitedhim, and. not before .    It seemed to him dangerous toleave the situation as at present, and. it hardlyseemed necessary, for the Germans, before replying, to await the formation of the new French Government .The German Chancellor had given advance replies on certain points, but had asked that these should, not becommunicated, to any foreign Government.    This was very embarrassing, as his answers included a. refusal to give
an undertaking not to fortify the Rhinelan^ .    rt wasvery difficult to keep this information back fromthe French Government, and. more particularly fromthe Belgian Government.    In the circumstances hethought the best plan was to ask TTerr TJit ler now foran answer.    This could be done either through the ambassador or by sending a British Minister to Berlin.If Herr Hitler was asked to receive a british minister he would probably ask him the crucial question of what our idea was as to the future ofthe League of ?!ations   a question to which wewere not yet in a position to reply.   An alternative was to instruct T-Lis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to take upthe question.En the course of a short discussion it wassuggested, that the main object of any action we tookwould not be so much to demonstrate to our own public the bona fide desire of T-bis Majesty&apos;s Government to push on with the business, as to secure the nextstep in our policy.    It was suggested that thisobject would not be attained by pressing the german chancellor further.There was general agreement  that, it would be a mistake to press Herr hitler to receive a british minister.    It was recalled that the decision had.been that a British Minister should only be sentif he was asked ^or by. the German Government .    mhesuggestion was made, therefore, that a Despatchmight be sent to His Majesty&apos; s Ambassador in Berlinreplying to the reasons on which the German chancellor had based hi? refusal to reply:    for example, it couldbe pointed, out that the argument that he was to await the formation of a French Ministry was a ba* one,since the situation was a continuing one and. we -eredealing with the German Government on our ownrespons responsibility.
Another point of view was that T-ferr Hitler wo aidreply that  if he gave an answer to the Questionsit would have to he published, and the French Presswould then start picking holes in his reply.    In thisconnection it was recalled that Herr Hitler did. not propose an indefinite postponement of his reply, butonly until June, when the French Government had beenformed .    By pressing br a reply on the key question as to the future of the League oNations and whetherit was to be given more &quot;teeth&quot; or not, he might turn the tables on us .    It was suggested, also that the argument of the French Elections was not a bad one.Nevertheless, there was a good deal of doubt, a^ towhether this was the real reason for T-Terr TJritler&apos;sdelay in sending his reply.   TJTe was probably thinking of the future of sanctions and of Anglo-italian relations as well as of the League of Nations itself.The prospect of a favourable reply had always been apoor one, but if we were to press -Terr TJitler to give it.  it was more likely to be unfavourable now thanlater on.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said,that the great difficulty of delay for another twoor three weeks was in withholding from the Frenchand ^elgians the information a- to T-Terr Hitler&apos;refusal to undertake not to fortify the Rhineland..In this latter connection the Cabinet were reminded that the French had abandoned their Manoeuvresand were sending the troops to the Magi not Line, and.were reported to have information that the germans were actually fortifying the Rhineland.    It would bedifficalt, it. was suggested, to tell the French later that we had kept the information about the Rhinelandback for their own good...
It was suggested, however, that to let the matterdrift for long would he inadvisable, as if no further steps were taken to obtain an answer it would be saidthat the Government were lukewarm in their policy.One view was that we should not press the Germansfor the moment, and that even if their answer was not satisfactory we should not break off negotiations but should attempt to obtain a meeting of all the inter-ested Powers, at which the Germans could be present to .give their answers, which at the moment were bound tobe unfavourable.&quot;he Cabinet were&apos;reminded that we ourselves hadtaken some time to answer -Terr Hitler&apos;s letter, andthat that was a reason far not pressing too strongly.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded the  Cabinet that if the re-fortification of the zonebecame a fact we shoulJ be in an awkward, situationvis-a-vis the French and Belgian Governments. As theresult of the discussion he thought the best plan would be for him to send a Despatch to T*is Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin, in which he should embody someof the reasons which embarrassed us at  getting no answer, e .g., our inability to pass on to the other interested. Governments Herr Hitler.&apos; s statement aboutthe fortification of the Rhine1and.The Prime Minister agreed that a Despatch shouldbe sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin asking him to have a talk with the German Government or foreign Secretary on these lines.^he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreedthat there would, be no question of publishing theDespatch immediately, though it might have to bepublished later.There was general agreement that to explain our difficulties in the manner suggested by the Secretary
State Tor Foreign Affair? was rather different. fronU^ (insisting on a reply to the Questions.A suggestion was made that the Despatch should,draw attention to the favourable view taken by theGerman Chancellor of the proposed. Western Air pact and. that a suggestion might he included that, pending a full reply, he might develop his odeas to ^isMajesty&apos;s Government as to the proposed Air Pact .The Cabinet, were reminded, however, that, theGerman Chancellor had indicated that the presentposition of Russia increased the difficulties of an air Pact.    This probably meant that he would, suggestthat Germany should have one Air Force for theirEastern frontier and. another for their Western frontier.Even in military matters a duplication of that kind would be dangerous, but from the point, of view ofair forces, with their great mobility, it was out ofthe question,    would it not ^e better, it was asked, toobtain that information through informal conversations between Sir Erie Phipps and Baron von Nearath?It was suggested, that -hat Herr Hitler was reallywaiting for was the decision to be taken 551 the next session of the Council beginning on the l^th June as tothe sanctions on Italy.    If sanctions were kept onthere woulJ be a danger of the two Dictators gettingtogether;    if they were taken off there seemed somechance of doing business.Another view was that instructions should be sentto &apos;-Tis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to ask for a reply as soonas possible.    r.n support of this it was stated that the criticism of Bri4 ish policy was that it was vague and.inconsistent.    This was probably due to the fact thatthe policy was decided, by the Cabinet and. was apt to result in a compromise.
Yet another view was that the whole of our diffi-culties were due to the fact that our defence forces were inadequate.A criticise of the proposed. Despatch was thatit would not get the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs out o^ his difficulty on the fortificationof the Rhineland. .   T?is Majesty&apos;s Ambassador would be instructed to sa\ that that question had embarrassed,us.   The result might be that &quot;-err &apos;Jitler mightannounce it to the world, which woul^ be a bad result.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat he could reasonably withhold the answer from theFrench until the new Government cane into office *T-Te was more embarrassed, however, as regards the belgians, an&quot;1  thought he would have to explain why we should have to tell the Belgian Government soon.A comment was that as soon as the French and.Belgian Governments knew that Herr &apos;-Titler reservedthe. ri.rht of re-fortifying *he demilitarised zoneall hope of a negotiation woul&apos;&quot;1 disappear.    Me wanted a settlement, we knew that a Conference was the only hope, and we knew that Herr Hitler intended *o re-for* ify .   Hdw, it was asked, could these factors be reconciled?The Secretary op State for Foreign Affairs agree-&quot;that the last French Government weal-1 never have coneto a Conference in those cuv&quot;1 it ions , bat it ;...ight bethat the new French Coverument would take a differentv i ew .The Cabinet, agreed.  That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, as the result of the discussion,shoul^ d^aft a Fes patch to *-Tis Ma.iestv&apos;s-Ambassador in Perlin,
I U fJTtjg anglo-jrEATY nego-rpxAT ions .(previous references :Cabinet 3F(36), Con-conclusion 1,and Cabinet37 (36) , Con-elusion 6.)3 . The Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments on the subject of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations, the first two o,f&apos; which had been underconsideration at the Meeting held on May 11th:-The Recort of the Cabinet Committee(0 .P .-129 (36)):A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-131(36)):A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-136(36)), covering a draft telegram of instructions to the High commissioner in Egypt as a basis for discussion onthe reopening of nego*negotiations withNahas Pasha.    In his Memorandum theSecretary of State strongly urged hiscolleagues to reconsider their decisionon the question of reference to theLeague of Nations in the circumstancescontemplated, and to agree not to insist on the omission of such reference:and. drew particular attention to paragraphs 4 and 5 of the draft instructions to the TTigh Commissioner.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ashedthe Cabinet to consider the Egyptian negotiations inthe light of the situation in the Near East, includingPalestine, as well as of our foreign policy as a whole.The Egyptian Press, he reminded the Cabinet, was widelyread in Palestine and. Arabia.    If the negotiations wereto collapse, the breakdown would, come at a moment when we were confronting Signor Mussolini.    The BritishTJigh Commissioner in Egypt reported that if the presentopportunity for a settlement was not seized, the result would be to drive Egypt towards Italy.    The situationalso had. to be reviewed in the light of the numbersof troops required, in Egypt to meet such a position.Could we afford it with our present strength?   Hesuggested that what was required, was first a satisfactorysituation during the next twenty years, and that: if at the end of that period the question was referred, tothe Council of the League of Nations , it should, bede^lt with on the basis that the League was to proceed.- 9 -
on the assumption that the Suez Canal and the adjacentterritories, while being an integral part of Egypt,form an essential artery of all form0 of communication between different parts o* the British Empire, thepermanent maintenance and protection of which is thecommon interest of both High Contracting Parties.He was advised, that the proposal in C.P.-136 (36)did. secure that situation.   He therefore ashed theCabinet to reconsider the question of providing for a reference to the Council of the League.    It might bethat we should not thereby secure a Treaty, but hewould, sooner that, if a. break should, come, it should,be on the recognition of our position on&apos;the Canalthan on the issue of the League of Nations.   He there-fore asked the Cabinet to approve the despatch of atelegram on the lines o&quot; the enclosure to C.P.-136 (36)The vie1&apos;.&apos; was expressed, that the -Touse of commons would, not accept the reference to the League ofNations after twenty years, more particularly because we had. no idea what sort o;f a League of Nations wouldexist at the end of that time.Some members of the Cabinet, did. not take this view-.It was reported that some of the best-informed Membersof Parliament on Egyptian affairs would, cast very heavyblame on the Government if they did not seize thischance to secure a mreaty .The Cabinet were reminded, also that the Councilof the League could, only report against us on a unanimous decision, and it was difficult to conceiveof such a situation in twenty years&quot;  time.mhe Prime Minister said, that on a question of thisimportance the Cabinet ought to take its decisionpurely on merits and. not be influenced, by the Houseof Commons .    If the Cabinet were convinced, of what theright course was, the T-Touse of Commons would probablyaccept it.This view met with much support.- 3.0 -
Some members of the Cabinet who had previouslycriticise^ the proposal to make provision for a refer-ence to the Council of the League in the event of disagreement at the end of twenty years, took theview that the present proposals altered, the whole situation, since our claims in relation to the suez canal and. the adjacent territories were no longerstated, as terminable at the end. of twenty years butas recognised without a time-limit.    Consequently, eventhough a reference to a third, iparty was not very desirable, it could be accepted, with the new safeguards,more particularly in view o-r the dangers of thesituation in Egypt and. the Near East as outlined, bythe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs.irs .Questioned, as to why the views of the Cabinet infavour of a Conciliation Commission as a substitute forthe League of Nations (Cabinet 3* (35), Conclusion (b))was not acceptable, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs pointed, out that a Conciliation procedure would,not be acceptable to the Egyptian Government and. wouldinvolve political difficulties owing to its implicationof doubt  in the future of the League .The view was expressed that the good, will of Egyptwas very important at the present time.    It wassuggested that the attitude of Egypt to Great britain was now very different from what it had been in thepast, and that it could, be continued provided it wasinclinedmade clear that we were not inclined/to camouflage ourdomination over Egypt.The Secretary o-* State for dominion Affairs, whilevery conscious of the views expressed on behalf ofAustralia and South Africa, thought that the cabinet ought to take its decision on merits.   He urged strongly that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouldtake a.n early opportunity of communicating the decision- 11 -

He urged strongly that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouldtake an early opportunity of communicating the decision
i o 0of the Cabinet to the representatives of theseDominions.The question was raised as to whether we werejustified in assuming that if the concessions nowproposed were made, we should thereby secure a Treaty.there was still the difficult question of the Sudan.Sometimes it was a good plan to explore each pointbefore making concessions on any.    Tt would be veryregrettable to make these big concessions on themilitary aspects only to encounter insurmountabledifficulties on another question, anJ it was recalled.that the 1930 Treaty had. broken down on the Sudaninvolving-clauses after agreement  /  large concessions had. beenreached, on the Sue-7. Canal.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said.thai, he had been examining the Sudan situation in thehope of finding some concession there which mightfacilitate agreement on the military question, butthis had not proved to be the case .   From the &quot;beginningit had. been thought best to try and. settle themilitary clauses first, and we were not placed in aworse situation in this respect by his proposals, which,if agreement could be reached, would be an improvement on what had. been accepted by previous Governments .The Chancellor of the Exchequer urged, that itshould be made quite clear that these importantconcessions could, only be made in order to obtain a mreaty as a whole .The Lord. President of the Council thought  that nothing should, be announced until either the mreatyhad been completed or h?d failed.A suggestion was made that in Paragraph 4, line 11,of the enclosure to CP .-136 (36), for the word,&quot;form&quot; should, be substituted &quot;must ai&apos;ays form&quot;.- 12 -
It was pointed, out that in lines 12 and 13 the phrase &quot;the permanent maintenance and protection ofwhich is in the common interest of &quot;both High ContractingParties&quot; appeared to refer to the British Empire.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence urgedver3r strongly that we must not hand over to the Councilof the League the right to say at the end of twenty years whether we were entitled to defend the Sues Canalor not, but only how many troops we required for thispurpose, and where they were to be placed.    &apos;He insisted that the High Commissioner should be instructed tostate this condition clearly to the Egyptian negotiatorsand to secure its inclusion in a proces-yerbal.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat it was politically inconceivable that the Councilof the League of nations would take the view that wecould not station a reasonable number of troops in the canal.The Lord Chancellor felt more doubtful on thispoint.      The Egyptians might claim that they had a. perfectlygood army which had been greatly improved during the twenty years that had elapsed since the conclusion of theTreaty, and. that their troops were as good as theBritish.      The maintenance of British troops was anessential requirement which ought not to be conceded,even if by holding to the point we could not secure aTreaty.
1 91 uIn support of the Conciliation procedure discussed on the previous occasion at the Cabinet, it wassuggested that the Egyptians knew the uncertain futureof the League as well as we did.    En these circum-stances it  seeded doubtful whether they would insistvery strongly on reference to the Council of theLeague and might be willing to adopt in preference aCo nc il ia t ion pro c ed ur e .mhe difficulties of this course were repeated.The question was raised, as to what would, be theposition at the end of twenty years if.the Council ofthe League had ceased, to exist.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat, according to the legal advisers of 4he Foreignwe could argue that office, in such a case/the &quot;treaty position would bemaintained.    Possibly, however, some other form ofarbitration might be found.One suggestion was that a demand, might be made that The r-Tague Court should appoint an arbitratorand that the Optional Clause might be invoked, inthip connection.The question was also raised as to what would, bethe position if the Egyptian negotiators refusedthe present proposals.    Vas the Cabinet then to beasked to adopt a lower minimum in the face of thethreatening situation in Egypt?Tie Minister for Co-ordInation of Defence madeperfectly clear that, he could agree to the present proposals only on the hypothesis that the Treatymade it quite plain that our right to maintain troopsin the Suez Canal zone was permanent and. that arbi-tration could, only be resorted to in regard to thenumber of the troops and the positions they were to occupy.   Moreover, he insisted tliat the British High
Commissioner in Egypt mast make clear in the negotia-tions that the number of troops to be maintained mustbe adequate and not merely symbolic,    He could agreealso only because he understood that we were to remainfirm on this point and because we could not at presentface the possibility of sending large numbers of troops to Egypt.&quot;he Chancellor of 4he Exchequer placed, on record.that he had not. changed his view as to the undesirabilitythe decision ofof handing over a vital point in Imperial Defence to/a third party; but he could accept the present proposalbecause, as he had already explained, it contained anew factor in providing &quot;or the future.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said hehad. only brought, the question back to the Cabinet owingto his anxiety as to the political situation.The Secretary of State for vVar said that hisposition was the same ^s that of the Chancellor of the^exchequer,   He thought  that the new clause, thoughinvolving a slight risk, could be accepted.   he informed, the Cabinet , however, that the Chief of theImperial General Staff s reading of the clause wasthat it &apos;&quot;&quot;id not provide a satisfactory position.The Prime Minister then asked every member of theCabinet to express his vie&quot; s .mhe great majority o,? the members wer-- prepared toaccept the proposal of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs as set forth in C^-ISS (36) and. thedraft Despatch in the Enclosure, subject to theaddition, in the third, paragraph of the Despatch&apos;C.P .-136 (36), page 4, line 4) after the words  &quot;theterms of the revised Treaty&quot;, of the following:-&quot;with regard to the position and numberof troops require^ to defend the Canal&quot;.
The 7-Tome Secretary accepted the decision on theunderstanding thag the clause in the Treaty would he so framed as to make clear that the position claimed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Suez Canal and. theadjacent territories was a continuing one&apos;    that theCouncil of the League would not be able to cancel this position but only to decide the numbers of troops and where they were to be stationed .Several members of the Cabinet associated themselves with this condition of acceptance.The Lord Chancellor woulJ have preferred arejection of these proposals.The acceptance of one member of the Cabinet was accompanied by an expression of opinion that thequestion of the Sudan ought to be dealt with beforethe concession was made.   Another member of the Cabinetexpressed, a, preference for a. Treaty for twenty years without any provision for the future thereafter.Subject to the above, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in C.?.-13 5(3 6) and the draft telegram attached, asan enclosure, subject to -(i) the deletion from the second,paragraph of Paragraph 2 ofthe enclosure to C.P.-13 6 (3S)of the argument about the Leagueof Nations , and.(ii) the addition in Paragraph 3(page 4 of C..p.-136 (35), line 4)after the words &quot;the terms of the revised Treaty&quot; of the following:-&quot;with regard to the positionand. numbers of troops required,to defend the Canal&quot;:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should consider the proposal thatthe British High Commissioner in egypt should, make plain in the negotiations and. record on the proceo-verba 1 the.  meaning attached by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the appropriate clause in the Treaty, namely, that the british forces to be maintained in the suez canal after the expiration of twenty-years coul&apos;&quot;1 not be reduced to a &quot;token&quot;force but must be substantial in number:in other words, the reference to thenumber of troops must not be read, as thoughit were &quot;the number of troops if any&quot;;    and
that the only questions that theCouncil of the Leagie, if appealed,to, would have to decide would hewhat the suhstantia.1 number oftroops was to be and where theyvere to be situated:(c)  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,  in consultation withthe Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, should take an esrly oppor-tunity to explain matters to representatives of the Dominions.
 EE ITALO-$isfute.Previous$Reference:kabinet 37(36)$Conclusion 5)4.

The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-135 (35))circulating, in pursuance of the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, a Memorandum prepared in the ForeignOffice on the question whether there were any signs that Italy, following her success in Abyssinia, haddesigns on the Yemen and. Saudi Arabia with a view to securing a position on both sides of the Red. Sea.The Memorandum stated that the final Italian success in Abyssinia was still so recent that there had. notbeen time enough to receive reliable reports to showwhether it had. led to any modification&apos;or developmentof Italian policy in this matter.   Nevertheless, inall the circumstances, although the Italians were not likely to be deterred by treaty obligations under theAnglo-Italian Rome Conversations of 1937, and were capable of many acts of folly, it seemed, questionable whether they would, at present embark on so dangerous and. unprofitable an adventure.The Cabinet took note of the information contained in the above memorandum.- SO -
