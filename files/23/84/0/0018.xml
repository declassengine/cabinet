inUNEMPLOYMENTASSISTANCE.The new draft Regu-lations.(previous reference:Cabinet46 (36)Conclusion 2)The Committee resumed the discussion of theReport (CP. 172 (36)) of the Committee on theRegulations of the Unemployment Assistance board at the point reached at the conclusion of theMeeting held In the morning.Sir Ernest Strohmenger said that a question hadbeen asked as to the general nature of the reductions which would fall to be made under the new proposals.Over the whole of Great Britain about 50 per cent,of the reductions would be of the order of 2/- crless;    about 25 per cent, would be from 2/- to lessthan 5/-, and the remaining 25 per cent,  would be over 5/-o So far as England alone was concerned, the percentages conformed generally tothose given above for the whole of Great Britain.In Wales the percentages were (2/- and under) 40 percent.,  (.2/- to 5/&apos;-) 17 per cent., (over 5/-)over 40 per cent.,  and in Scotland the percentageswere (2/- and under) 57 per cent., (2/-to 5/-) 24per cent., (over 5/%-)       19 per cent.      The percent-ages for Wales were therefore worse and those forScotland better than the average for England or forthe country as a whole.The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to thequestion of the desirability of spreading the liquidation of the Standstill over a longer period than 12 months, and in particular of having nofixed dates for that liquidation.
Lord Rushcliffe said that the form ofthe Regulation would he to give the Boardpower, in consultation with the AdvisoryCommittees, to make increases in the assessments,which would otherwise he arrived at under theRegulations, of such amounts as would progressively&quot;bring the excessive payments into conformity withthe Regulations.      when the question of the formof the Regulation was discussed with the LawOfficers, they had in mind that there would bea time limit for its operation,  and he was uncertain whether,  if the time limit wereomitted, they would consider that the proposedRegulation would he intra vires the Act.Sir Ernest Strohmenger added that duringthe course of the afternoon the Law Officers hadbeen again consulted, and he thought that theposition was that a time limit would have to be definitely implied in the Regulation, if noactual period were specified.
Lord Rushcliffe said that in addition to thelegal difficulty, there w s c  also very grave objectionfrom the administrative and practical points of viewto the omission of a time limit.      Without a time limit it would be impossible to exercise effectivepressure on many local Advisory Committees to bring the standards in their areas into conformity with the new regulations.      There would be a widespread reluctanceon the part of local Advisory Committees to recommendwould bethe making of&apos;&apos; reductions, and the tendency/to allowmatters to drift on, particularly in view of the, factthat the whole cost was borne by the Exchequer and no part of it by local Funds. It would be verydifficult indeed in many cases for the Board to actin the absence of any advice from the local AdvisoryCommittees concerned.The President of the Board of Education pointedout that under the Board&apos;s own proposals for the liquidation of the Standstill, the Board ?/ould,  infact,  override Authorities like those in South Walesrecommendif those Authorities refused to / reductions in thegrossly excessive cases. The Bor-rd did not proposeto wait until the 12 months had expired before taking action in such cases.    He urged that in the case of very many Authorities whose administration had beencorrect and at the same time sympathetic to theunemployed, there was a serious risk, if the time limitwas inserted in the Regulations,  that the Authoritiesin question would be content to wait for the expir-ation of the time limit.      If there was no time limitthere would, in his opinion, be a much greaterincentive for the Authorities in question to bringthe new Regulations into early operation.
Lord Rushcliffe said that he did not agree.   Hewas also opposed to suggestions that the time limit should he one of 12 months with a power to extendeither indefinitely or up to a fixed period, say another12 months.    In either case when the time came, the pressure to extend would he very difficult, if not impossible, to resist.The Lord President of the Council thought that itmight he worth while considering some extension of theperiod of 12 months if by so doing the mass attack onthe proposals could be broken up.      It would be ofgreat technical advantage if this could be done.&apos;The Lord Privy Seal enquired whether it would bepossible to devise a time table for the liquidation ofthe Standstill, under which the great bulk of the reductions would be effected within the period of 12months, leaving the more difficult problems in SouthWales and similar areas to be disposed of thereafter.Lord Rushcliffe thought that it would be almostimppssible to draft a Regulation on these lines whichwould be workable and would not be very vulnerable toattacic, both in Parliament and outside.The Minister of Health suggested that the period of12 months might be extended to 18 months,  or even to2 years.      The situation would,  in his view, be considerably eased if the period could be somewhatlengthened.The President of the Board of Education failed tosee why the Board would be in any way prejudiced by being given a completely free hand in the matter.    Hewas sure that the Board shared the Cabinet&apos;s anxietythat a storm should not be provoked, and that theywould wish to avoid any risk of a second breakdown of the Regulations.
The Lord Chancellor was satisfied that unless a time limit was inserted in the Regulations, theAuthorities in those areas where the greatestscandals and abuses existed would decline to co-operate in any way in bringing the new proposals intooperation, and would exercise every kind of politicaland other pressure to postpone the reductions,,Sir Ernest Strohmenger explained that the Boardattached great importance to the new Regulationsbeing brought into full operation by means of pro-gressive adjustments within a definite and limited period.The Lord President of the Council expressed theview that as soon as the Regulations had received theapproval of Parliament the Board would then be in aposition to bring them into operation progressivelyand as rapidly as circumstances might permit.      Itwould be     possible for the Board to adopt a muchstricter attitude after the Regulations had been inoperation for some months than they could hope to doimmediately after Parliament had approved them.     on political grounds he was disposed to favour the omission of a time limit.The Minister of Health did not believe that itwould ever be possible to keep this subject out of politics, or to prevent Parliament from interestingitself in it.    He was satisfied that unless a time limit was inserted in the Regulations, the Standstillcould never be effectively liquidated.The President of the Board of Education did not agree. - If there was no time limit, he thought that over most of the country the Standstill would havebeen liquidated in IS months, and the worst abusesin the distressed areas would also have been dealtwith in that period.
Lord Rushcliffe was very much afraid that inthe absence of a fixed time limit, there would heconstant pressure to postpone again and again the reductions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that whatever course was adopted was open to objection and difficulty.    Would it be possible to have a fixed time limit with power to the Board to extend in individual cases?Lord Rushcliffe thought that such a proposal would place the Board in a most difficult andinvidious position.    It would clearly be out of thequestion for the Board to act in the individual casesafter the expiration of the fixed period on theadvice of the Advisory Committees, and it might well have to face organised and concerted action on thepart of large numbers of individuals concerned at one and the same time.The President of the Board of Education thoughtthat it should, be possible to liquidate the Stand-still at different speeds in the different areas.All that would be necessary woul^ be for the board to give instructions on the subject to their local officers. There need be no publication of how thearrangements were being carried, out in the variouslocalities.The Minister of Health doubted whether thiswould, in fact be so.    It would soon be generally known what was happening in each area, because the
recommendations of the Advisory Committees would bepublished.    In his opinion there was much to be gained by having an adequate time for the liquidation of the standstill.    The danger of a too short period forthe liquidation was that if the arrangements broke down it would then be necessary to bring the matter again before Parliament,in the worst possible circum-stances .The Minister of Labour agreed, but thought that,while over large parts of the country the Standstillcould, be liquidated in 1?. months, it would, not be practicable wholly to liquidate the Standstill inthat period .    South Wales was a particularly difficultarea, in which some Authorities were actually savingtheir rates at the expense of the Exchequer inconnection with this service.The Minister of Health said that he favoured theextension of the liquidation period from 12 to 18months, which latter, he thought, would, be a fair and reasonable period..Lord. Rushcliffe stated, that if the Cabinet agreed,with the Minister of Health he would submit thesuggestion to the Unemployment Assistance Board, buthe could, not, of course, say what attitude the board would, adopt towards it.   As between an extension from12 to 18 months and a time limit with power to extendin individual cases, he had little doubt that theBoard, would, prefer the former.The President of the Board, of Education strongly urged that, from the political and other points ofview, it would, be very much better to have no time limit at all.    It was quite impossible to foreseehow public opinion would, react to the new Regulations,and. it might well be that by inserting a time limit
the Government would, when the time limit expired,again have to face a situation similar to that of lastyear.   He thought that in practice over very largeparts of the country the Standstill could he liquidated,in about 18 months&apos;  time, but the process of liquidation-tion would, in certain areas have to go rather slower than the Board, seemed to contemplate.    In particular,the distressed, areas would require sympathetic and.c ar eful tr eatment. &apos;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had.much sympathy with the suggestion that there should,be no time limit, but he appreciated, the great diffi-culties with which the Board, were confronted..    On thewhole he felt that a time limit was necessary.   Hewas prepared, therefore, to accept the compromisesuggested, by the Minister of Health.    The longer period,of 18 months would, give more time for the new blockgrants to come into operation.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs thought that the arguments on ea.eh side were veryevenly balanced, but on the whole, while he held, novery strong views, he favoured, the omission&apos;of thetime limit .After some further discussion the Cabinet agreedthat the time limit for the liquidation of the Stand-still should be 18 months from the date at which thenew Regulations begin to operate, and. not 12 months from that date, as suggested, in paragraph 43 of theAppendix to  CP.-172 (36).Lord Rushcliffe undertook to ascertain the viewsof the Unemployment Assistance Board, on this proposal.
Household The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he waslot   includ- , , ^% the Earnings   anxious to secure agreement in regard to the Earnings&apos;le* Rule, and was accordingly prepared to make certain concessions in the matter.   He felt that the proposal of the Secretary of State for Scotland, to raise the14/- to 17/-, while relieving the Secretary of State&apos;difficulties in Scotland, would, create, if possible,greater difficalties and. embarrassments in England, and.Wales.    In order to secure agreement he was preparedto agree to the 14/- being increased, to 13/-, and hehad. no objection, if the Cabinet so wished, toabolishing the differentiation between wage earnersaged 21 and over and. those aged. 18 to 21.    The result would, be that instead, of three age groups, as indicated.in the paragraph at the head, of page 7 of C.&apos;p.-172(35), there would, be only two age groups, namely,those wage earners over 18 and. those wage earnersunder 13 respectively.       The amended proposal would be to the following effect   that the wageearning members aged. 18 and. over should, retain thefirst IS/- of their earnings plus one half of theremainder, with a minimum of 20/-, this to be inclusive of the wage earner&apos;s maintenance&apos;    and under 18, 12/-plus one half of the remainder.The Secretary of State for Air hoped, very much that the Cabinet would, accept the suggestion of theChancellor of the Exchequer.    This was a matter inwhich public opinion was much interested, and. he had always felt that if the Government had insisted, on maintaining the proposal in the form set out on page 7of the Committee&apos;s Report it would have been most difficult for their supporters to defend, that proposal on merits.At a later stage of the Meeting Lord. Rushcliffewarned the Cabinet that the Unemployment Assistance-9-
Board attached very great importance to diecriminat-ing at the age of 21, for the reasons which had been explained, to the Cabinet earlier in the day.    Inthese circumstances he would like to suggest apossible alternative, namely, that for the age group18 to 21 the wage earning members should, be allowedto retain the first 14/- of their earnings plus one half of the excess, with a. minimum of 18/-, and. those over 21 to retain the first 16/- of their earningsplus one half of the remainder, with a minimum of,20/-.The Minister of Health observed, that thisproposal did. not meet the objections which had been raised to differentiating at the age of 21.Sir Ernest Strohmenger said that the Board, feltvery strongly indeed, upon this subject, and. therewould, be very great difficulty in asking them to reconsider their previous decision.    They attachedvery great importance, on grounds of principle, to more favourable treatment being given to adults than to adolescents .   A large majority of the adolescentsconcerned were earning less than 20/- a week, andunder the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequerthey would, make no contribution to the expenses of the household, although in actual practice they had. alwayscontributed, and should, so contribute.   He agreedthat it was the practice in big cities   London,Manchester, Birmingham and. Liverpool   not to differentiate at the age of 21, but it was thepractice in other urban areas, large and small, to differentiate.   Moreover, it was the general practiceof the great, majority of Local Authorities to distinguish between the first and subsequent wage earners in the household.
The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs pointed out that in Scotland it was the exceptionand not the rule to discriminate at the age of21.   The introduction of such discrimination inScotland, would be the subject of very acutecriticism.Lord Rushcliffe repeated, that in England itwas true that the four large cities did notdifferentiate at the age of 21.       Other large towns did. so differentiate.   Moreover, there wasthe practical&apos; difficulty that, as had. been stated,the great majority of the Local Authoritiesdistinguished, between the first and. subsequentwage earners.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested, thatit might be possible, while retaining the figureof IS/- for those aged. 18 and. over, to have a lower minimum than 20/- for those aged. 18 to21.The Lord President o^ the Council thought that:,however reasonable the formula might be, theGovernment would still be criticised, for breaking up the unity of family life.There was general agreement that the compromisesuggested, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the outset of the discussion on this subject should, beadopted..Lord. Rushcliffe undertook to convey the viewsof the Cabinet on the subject to the Board., but was unable to commit the Board, in any way to accepting the suggested compromise.
The HouseholdTest includingthe earnings rule.(Group IV -Other Members)The President of the Board of Educationsaid that he had understood that all the membersof Group IV were to be treated as boarders, butin view of what had been said at the Meeting earlier in the day he was now uncertain as to how thepersons in this group were going to be treated.Sir Ernest Strohmenger assured the Cabinetthat the persons in this group would be treatedmore favourably than unmarried sons and daughterswho were members of the household.      So long asthe persons in Group IV were &quot;members of the household&quot; and not lodgers, they could not betreated merely as boarders.The Minister of Labour said that the exactposition of persons in this group had been agreed between himself and the Board, and would be fullyset out and explained in the White Paper.Single Personsin Lodgings.The Chancellor of the Exchequer urged theCabinet to accept the figure of 15/- with full discretion to the Board to make adjustments byway of increase or reduction to meet the circum-stances of particular cases.The Secretary of State for War pointed outthat the figure of 15/- would be criticised by reference to the 1931 Transitional Payment figureof 15/3d.      It would be said that this was theonly economy   cut which had not been restored.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained thatthe Benefit figure had not been fixed by referenceonly to the needs of the applicant.Sir Ernest Strohmenger said that the board were satisfied that the proper arrangement wasto insert the figure of 15/- in the regulations and for the Board to be empowered to increase or
reduce that figure in individual cases.The Secretary of State for Scotland againreferred to the cost of food in lodging-houses in glasgow being 9/4d.      In addition, the applicantwould have to pay rent and clothehimself.    For all this 15/- was inadequate.The President of the Board of Education thoughtthat 15/- would he ample in many parts of the country.The Board were prepared to increase this figure,where necessary.     Would it not he possible to include in the Regulations an express provision empowering the Board to pay at a higher rate than 15/- inparticular areas?Sir Ernest Strohmenger said that the Board had made careful investigations and had satisfied them-general rateselves that 15/- as a/was adequate, even in placeslike Glasgow,      It should be remembered that many ofthe men in the lodging-houses to which the Secretaryof State for Scotland had referred, were fully employed men or men employed for one or two days aweek, who would well afford to pay more.The Secretary of State for Scotland repeated that as a result of the enquiries he had made he had formed the definite opinion that a single man couldnot live in Glasgow for 15/- a week.The Minister of Labour said that the difficulty was that the Board had to make a Regulation applic-able not    to Glasgow alone, but to the whole ofGreat Britain.     He was satisfied, for the reasons which he had given to the Cabinet, that a youngsingle man should not get more than 15/- a week.The Secretary of State for Scotland asked whetherit was politically wise for the British Governmentto announce that the needs of a single man could be
satisfied for 15/-.     He was sure that this figure was too small.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatthere appeared to he some difference as to the facts.      Ifthe facts, as stated by the Secretary of State for Scotland,were right, 15/- appeared to be inadequate, but the Boardquestioned the correctness of the facts.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that theadditional cost of raising the 15/- to 17/- throughout great Britain would be  300,000 per annum.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that taken together the two concessions he had offered on the earnings rule would cost  550,000&quot;*&quot; per annum.      This meant that thetotal additional cost of the new proposals would be about 1,000,000   per annum over and above what was being spentat present on the Standstill.In reply to questions, Sir Ernest Strohmenger saidthat in London a single man would receive 10/- a week plus the rent of his room which, as a rule, would be 5/-,      Itshould be remembered that rents in London were very high.In his view it would be quite impracticable to attempt to differentiate in this matter by areas.      One difficulty wasthat any differentiation based on areas would involve differ-entiating in favour of London and other high-rented areas.The President of the Board of Education said that hewould like to see the Board given some discretion to differentiate in this matter by areas, in addition toexercising their discretion in regard to individuals.Lord Rushcliffe thought that there would be endlesstrouble and difficulty if the Board were empowered to dealwith the matter by reference to areas.-14-It has since been ascertained that the figure of  550,000 includes the cost of a previous alteration of the earnings rule giving theminimum of 20/- for earners of 21 and over, and 16/- for earnersof 18 to 20, estimated at  250,000.      The further increase of cost should therefore be  300,000 and. the total increase over and above what was now being spent on the Standstill would be approximately  800,000 per annum.
The Secretary of State for Scotland thought thatthe Board&apos;s discretion should he as flexible aspossible as regards these single men.      Be was veryapprehensive that in this matter the situation of 18months ago might be repeated.      It would be verydifficult to defend this particular proposal in theHouse of Commons.      If the Chancellor of the exchequer could not see his way to increase the 15/- to 17/-,would he be prepared to compromise at 16/-?The President of the Board of Education preferred to retain the figure of 15/-, but to include in theRegulations a provision empowering the Board to use their discretion in particular areas.Lord Rushcliffe said that he was not prepared togive a final answer on this point.      The suggestion was open to very grave administrative difficulties, butif the Cabinet so wished he would have the matterlooked, into, with a view to seeing whether it mightbe practicable to include some appropriate words inthe Regulations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that itwould, be very difficult indeed, to include in theRegulations a discretion relating to the areas inwhich these single men lived.    The only common factorwould, be rent, and. then London and other high-rented.areas would, come to the forefront.    In fact it mightbe found, that the point involved, a question of substance and. was much more than one of mere drafting.Lord. Rushcliffe observed that the circumstancesof the cases varied enormously.   A governess or aclerk would, require more than 15/-; a gipsy certainlyless .   The problem was much more than a mere area-15-
problem, and in his opinion it could only be dealtwith by the exercise of     discretion in each individual case .The Cabinet agreed, that the Unemployment Assist-ance Board!&apos; s proposal, as approved by the Committee,viz., that the rate should be 15/- subject to ad. jus t-ment by way of increase or reduction to meet thecircumstances of a. particular case, should, beadopted .The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested, thatthe Cabinet Committee should, prepare, for theconsideration of the Cabinet, the draft of a vVhitePaper, and that the President of the Board of Educa-t ion should, be added, to the Committee as a member toassist in the drafting;    the Committee to meet afterthe views of the Unemployment Assistance Board onthe Conclusions rea.ch.ed by the Cabinet had. been as certained..The Minister of Labour informed, the Cabinet thathe proposed on the following day to make a statement in the &quot;feuse of Commons to the effect that he hoped,to be able to lay the new Regulations before Parlia-ment in about a fortnight&apos;s time.The President of the Board, of Education stated,that in all the circumstances he had. decided, to acceptthe decision of the Cabinet that the time limit forthe liquidation of the Standstill should be 18 months.He would, therefore no longer press his suggestion forthe omission of any mention of a. definite time limit.The Cabinet agreed.  (l) The Household Test. - (including, the earnings Rule)      That there should besubstituted for the Board&apos;s proposals as approved, by the Committee and setout in the paragraph at the head, ofpage 7 of the Committee&apos;s Report (C ..P .-172 (36)) the following proposals:-
