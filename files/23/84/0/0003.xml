1, The Cabinet had before them the following papers s-A Memorandum by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries (H.A.-18 (36)), covering thedraft Tithe Bill, the object of which wasto carry out the principal recommendationsof the P.eport of the Royal Commission onTithe Rent charge, as modified by the cabinet decisions announced in the White paper(Cmd.  5102).The 5th Conclusions (36)  (Minute 1) of theCommittee of Home Affairs,  in which certain amendments of the draft Bill were made andin which the point of principle noted belowwas reserved for consideration by theCommittee on Tithe Rentcharge, and afterwardsby the Cabinet.      The Home Affairs Committee&apos;recommendation to the Cabinet was as followss-&quot;To authorise the introduction in theHouse of Commons at an early date,with a view to its passage into law before the Summer Recess, of theTithe Bill in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-18 (36), subjects(a) To the reservation of thepoint of principle relatingto the rate of redemptionpayments on non-agricultural land, which was to be thesubject of special considera-tion by the Cabinet Committeeon Tithe Rentcharge on thefollowing day    and(b) To the amendments set out above and to any other drafting or other alterations, not involving serious points ofprinciple, that may be foundnecessary or desirable.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported, withreference to (a) above, that the Cabinet Committee onTithe Rentcharge, after a long discussion, had agreedto recommend the Cabinet to accept the proposal of theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries that the rate ofredemption payments on non-agricultural land should bemaintained at the present figures of annual titherentcharge, i.e. that Clause 9(1) of the Bill as drafted(H.A.-18 (36;)  should be accepted in principle.He added that one question had remained open
between the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty as to whether the arrearsshould be collected by the tithe-owners or the inland Revenue, but Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty had now acceptedthe proposals in the Bill and it was unnecessary,therefore,  to trouble the Cabinet with the matter.The Cabinet Committee had wished to ascertain from theGovernment Actuary the effect of the proposals in theBill on the Church Pension schemes.      The government actuary reported that he could not say more than that hewas satisfied that there was a genuine claim for asubstantial amount.      The data available were so inadequatethat he could not, without a prolonged investigation, puta precise value on the claim.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries addedthat Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty had agreed that if the higher rate of  105 for non-agricultural land was maintainedthey would undertake to deal with the Pension Fund.The Bill would be printed and circulated on Saturday orMonday next with a view to Second Reading on the 12thor 14th May.The Cabinet were given to understand that whilerepresentatives of the Church would probably criticise the Bill, they would not oppose its passage.In reply to the Lord President,  the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries stated that he had beenin touch with the representatives of the universities and there was a fairly large measure of agreement withthe Bill.The Minister of Health warned the Cabinet thatthe Cabinet Committee&apos;s recommendation in regard tourban land involved reopening his settlement withthe local authorities and might lead the authoritiesto claim that the whole rating aspects of the  scheme
should he re-examined.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the recommendation ofthe Committee of Home Affairs asset forth above, together with) the recommendation cf the CabinetCommittee on Tithe Rentcharge as reported orally by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (see page 1 of this conclusion).
THE COALMINES BILL.0 &quot;(previous references %Cabinet 8(36) Con-elusion 7,and Cabinet23 (36) con-clusion 11.)2.    The Cabinet had -under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary for Mines (H.A.-17 (36)), covering the draft Coal Mines Bill, the objects of which werefirstly, to strengthen the power of compulsoryamalgamation contained in part II of the Coal mines act, 1930i    and,  secondly, to continue for a furtherfive years, from the end of 1937, Part I of the sameAct, dealing with the production, supply and sale ofcoal.The Cabinet had also before them &apos;the Conclusionsof the Committee of Home Affairs on the draft Bill, inwhich certain amendments were introduced and in whicha point was reserved for the Cabinet, on Clause 5,Sub-Section (1), concerning the period of 14 days inwhich an aggrieved person would in certain circumstances be entitled to make application to the High Court or,in Scotland, to the Court of Session.      The committee made the following recommendation to the Cabinet(H.A.C.  5th Conclusions (36), Minute 2)s-&quot;To authorise the introduction in theHouse of Commons at an early date ofthe Coal Mines Bill in the form of thedraft annexed to H.A.-17 (36), subjectto %(a) reservation of the point onClause 5, Sub-Section (1)mentioned above,(b) the amendments mentionedabove and to any otherdrafting or minor altera-tions that may be foundnecessary or desirable.&quot;
The President of the Board of Trade reportedwith regard to (a) above that the Lord chancellor had agreed with the extension of the period withinwhich an aggrieved person woald in certain circumstances be entitled to make application to the High Court or,in Scotland, to the Court of Session from fourteen days to six weeks.      There was, therefore, no questionof detail for the Cabinet to decide.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the recommendation of theCommittee of Home Affairs as setforth above.
FOREIGN policy.The Cabinet had before them once more a(previous reference:Cabinet 31(36)Conclusion 3.)FR,Questions to be     memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreignaddressed to theGerman Govern- Affairs (CP.123(36)) containing a draft of a seriesment.of questions to be addressed to the GermanGovernment.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the difficulty in drafting thequestions had been not to give offence to theGermans and not to encourage them to make freshclaims.     The paragraph relating to colonies, forexample, had been re-drafted several times so as toavoid inviting the Germans to raise their maximumdemands.The Cabinet then discussed the questionsset forth in paragraphs 5 to 13 of the draft despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlincontained in the enclosure to CP, 123 (36).Paragraph 5 (Whether Germany possesses, &quot;completeequality&apos;!).After the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had answered certain questions, the cabinet agreed:(a)    To approve paragraph 5.Paragraph 6(The German View of the Maintenance of .the remaining operative Clauses of the Treaty ofVersailles). &quot;The reference in line 5 to the recentAnglo-German Naval Agreement was criticised on theground that it would be a mistake to draw theattention of the German Government to the fact thatthe Naval Agreement had its origin in the provisionsof the Treaty of Versailles.     It was suggested that even though historically correct politically it was hardly true.     As our desire was to tr3^ and clarify
certain points in the German memorandum in order toprepare the way for a negotiation? it was desirable tomake it as easy as possible for the Germans,consistently with the views of the other4 Governments concerned.While there was general agreement that weshould make clear that we did not accept the german governments historical interpretation of eventsconnected with the Treaty of Versailles, as set forth in paragraph 6 of the German Government1 s memorandumof the 51st March, it was felt to be unnecessary andinadvisable to include the separate memorandum on the historical argument set forth in the annex to cp. 123(36).The Cabinet agreed:(b)    To approve paragraph 6, subject to thefollowing alterations:-(i)    the omission from lines 5 and of the words &quot;such as therecent Anglo-German NavalAgreerne nt;    and(ii)    the deletion of the last sentence &quot;Their views areembodied in a separate memorandum (see Annex)&quot;as well as of tire Annex.Paragraphs 7 and 8.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the point of these paragraphs was to ascertain whether the German Government claimed to speak not only for the people of Germany itself but also for Germansoutside the Fatherland.Considerable discussion took place on thesetwo paragraphs,The general line of criticism was that the paragraphs, as at present drafted, were somewhatprovocative and might lead the Germans to give a reply which would increase our difficulties in bringing about
the desired negotiation.     For example, the effect of theGerman reply might produce a rejoinder from the FrenchGovernment which would check negotiations.     Paragraph 7ofin particular was criticised as being/rather apin-pricking character.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that this was a matter in which France andall Europe was greatly interested and, without someclearing up of the German position, it would be verydifficult to make progress with the proposed negotiation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatthe paragraphs might be drafted rather less categoricallyand the question might be stated in such a way as to bring out the fact that the Germans were not menacing in theWest.     For example, it might be said that Germany had given a satisfactory statement of their attitude towardsWestern Europe, but that in Eastern Europe theirattitude was not so clearly stated.     They might be asked if they could give a clearer assurance about Denmark,Cze c h o  Slovakia^, Poland, Soviet Russia, The Baltic StateMemel and Danzig and Austria that they had no aggressiveintentions. In fact, the question should be statedin such a way as to enable us to satisfy the FrenchGovernment that we had put the question to germany without causing friction with the German Government.In this connection, the Cabinet were reminded that Germany had offered a non-aggression pactto the limitrophe States.The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that he particularly disliked the last sentence of paragraph 7which gave the impression that while we thought theGermans meant one thing, we assumed for politeness sakethat they meant the other.
In the course of the discussion on these paragraphs, it was pointed out that drafting of theparagraxxh turned to some extent on our generalpolicy.     The Secretary of State for War took the opportunityto express his disagreement with an idea which had beenventilated   on the previous day that we ought to reach agreement with Germany even if it could not endure very long in order to gain time.     He agreed that this would be popular, but it would mean that we should have to standby while Germany violated Treaties and built up a vastempire in Europe v/ith a view to eventually becoming asea-power and dominating the world.     Prance and Belgiumalone could not resist Germany.     Prom a shorter point ofview, he disliked the idea. It might well drive theFrench to strike at Germany now - a course which appeared tobe favoured in certain quarters in Paris.     In spite of their confidence, he thought the French would probably get the worst of it and the Germans would then attack France andBelgium.     Could -we stand by and see France and Belgiumbeaten?       He would do everything possible to hold on to thenations that wanted peace, all of which it so happened were members of the League of Nations.     In this way, it might bepossible to show the Germans that they could not accomplishtheir aims.This point, however, was not followed up and the]Cabinet turned again to paragraphs 7 and 8.The uaoine-u agree a:(c)    That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should re-draft paragraphs and 8 in the light of tie discussion.
Paragraph 9 .(The Air Pact)This paragraph was approved, without discussion.Paragraph 10 (l-Ton-aggression. Pacts in relation to theLeague of Mations.)The Cabinet agreed:To approve paragraph 10; subject to thefollowing:-(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should consider further theinclusion of the penultimate paragraphbeginning &quot;There are two further points&quot;  as , if included, its drafting -might be affected by the re-drafting of paragraphs 7 and 8.(e) That the last sentence in paragraph 10should be omitted , namely,, &quot;his majesty&apos;s Government assume that thisis still the view of the GermanGovernment.&quot;Paragraph 11 (Colonies)Doubts were expressed as to the desirability of including any reference to the German desire for colonies.toThe main argument for referring/the matter wasthat the Germans were known to attach importance to it andthe Press in England had been full of suggestions thatthe subject v/ould be dealt with among the questions.Nearly every other point in the German memorandum had been referred to and to neglect this issue would, therefore, bethe more marked.On the other hand, it was pointed out that theGerman Government had not raised the question explicitlybut had merely expressed an expectation that within areasonable time after Germany&apos;s return to the League ofNations, the question would be cleared upe     The draft despatch under consideration had as its object the clearing up of certain questions with a view to a negotiation and the colonial question did not,, therefore,
arise at the present stage.     To mention the matterexplicitly might lead to a most embarrassing reply fromGermany.     Moreover, to do so was hardly consistent with the undertaking given by the Prime Minister at theHouse of Commons that we would not raise the question.The wording of the paragraph was criticised on the ground that it gave the impression that theGerman reply was likely to lead to a clarification oftheir attitude on colonies which might assist in thesolution of the question?which was not really thecase.     Something might be said for a statement that we ,were willing to treat or that we were not willing to treat on the question of colonies, but it was inadvisable to mention it in this vague fashion.The Cabinet agreed:(f)    That the question of colonies should not be referred toexplicitly, but in a generalmanner in some such formulaas the following:-&quot;There are other matters to be raised later butit is unnecessary to refer to them in this despatch,the object of which is toelucidate certain questionswith a view to arranging for a negotiation on thegeneral proposals.&quot;Paragraph 12 (The proposed separation of the Covenantfrom the. Treaty of Versailles).Questions were asked as to whether it wasnecessary to refer to this question but objections werenot presented.It was pointed out, however, that in theGerman memorandum, this question was linked with thatof German colonies and that this should be borne in mindin the drafting of the paragraph.
The Cabinet agreed:(g) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, while havingauthor! 1:3- to include paragraph 12if he thought necessary, should consider it in connection with paragraph 11, namely, the pointreferred to just above.Paragraph 13   was approved.annex the Cabinet agreed:(h) To delete the Annex as mentioned inConclusion (b)  (il) above.General.The despatch was then discussed as a whole fromthe point of view of whether it was calculated to carry outthe policy which the Cabinet had in mind, namely, to lead to a negotiation with a view to clearing up theEuropean situation.      It was recognised that on the onehand it was important to satisfy  the French that wehad asked full explanations on all essential points;and on the other hand that this must be accomplishedincludewithout stimulating the Germans to /some bitter passagethat would render further progress towards negotiationimpossible.      The Document, it was suggested,  should beas unsensational as possible in order to bring down theinternational temperature.      The impression it should giveshould be that v/e were most anxious to reach a bargainwith Germany but as a preliminary step we want to clear up their attitude on certain points.     The document alsomust satisfy our own public, but it was suggested that ourocanfeymcn probably realised by this time that one of the objects of the questions was to gain time for the Frenchduring the elections and would read it with that background.The Cabinet were reminded that the draftingwould vary considerably according as whether v/e desired that
in the event of an unfavourable reply on certain pointsthe negotiation should he closed down or that even an unfavourable response should not end the negotiation.A suggestion that net with general approval wasthat the despatch should be introduced by a newparagraph in which without emphasising our desire for good relations with Germany so strongly as to rouse Frenchsuspicions, we should demonstrate our warm desire for peace and the immense contribution to that end which it was within the power of nations to make.The Cabinet agreed:(i)    That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should re-draft the despatch in the light of thediscussion.Further Meeting of the Cabinet..The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Prime Minister that Europe in general and theFrench Government in particular were anxiously waiting thedespatch of these questions and he would like to send themto Berlin as soon as possible.The Prime Minister thought that in a matter ofthis supreme importance the Cabinet ought not to be rushedand that a further meeting should be held early in thefollowing week.     In this he was supported by many of hiscolleagues.The Cabinet agreed:(3)    That a meeting should be held onMonday, the 4th Ma;/, at 11.50 a.m.to consider a re-draft of thedespatch to be circulated by theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs.(k)    That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should see the french ambassador and explain the reasonsfor the delay.(The Lord President of the Council left at this point.The President of the Board of Education had left earlier in the discussion of this item.)- 13 -
[oADCAbTING. 4.    The Cabinet resuraed their consideration of theJlay Exchanges.    Report  (CP.  113 (36)) of the Cabinet Committee onBrevious Broadcasting.      (For the recommendations of the CabinetIference;Cabinet 31 Committee see Appendix to the present Conclusions).136), Con-Illusion 2.) The Home Secretary, as Chairman of the cabinet-fZ. 7J91at )&apos;0&apos; .   .*^       Committee, invited attention to Conclusion (1) on page80 of CP.  113  (36)  on the subject of relay exchanges.The Postmaster-General gave the Cabinet a summaryof the attitude taken on this subject by speakers inthe Parliamentary Debate of the previous day.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that hehad originally taken the view that the relay servicemust ultimately come under the Post Office.      his reasons were, first, that it -was a &quot;wired&quot; serviceand the Post Office, as responsible for the telephonesystem, already had a large &quot;wired&quot; service, and hethought it would be a complication to have a secondpurveyor of wires on a large scale:    second, because he was given to understand that broadcasting along the relay system presented such advantages that thesystem was probably expanding rapidly to-day and likelytoe xpand more in the future and might even eventuallysupersede ordinary radio transmission.      In that event,control ought to remain in the hands of the Government,for example, to provide for the contingency of war.There was, however, a contrary view that the relay system was likely to be superseded in the near future by the advent of cheaper radio instruments that would give a wider range of reception.     As there seemed some doubt on this matter, he had felt that the proposal of theCommittee would probably enable more information to be gained as the result of further experience.There was also the argument that the relay services- 14 -
gave a &quot;brighter Sunday programme.      Possibly theresult of this controversy would be that theBritish Broadcasting Corporation would brighten up its Sunday programmes.      He felt also that it would bea grievance if during the two or three years requiredby the post Office for experiment, people who wanted the relay service could not get it.       While he stillhoped that control would eventually come under thePost Office, he was willing to accept the Report.The Prime Minister also hoped that the relayservice would eventually be under Government control.He was rather apprehensive of creating conditionsby the lapse of time in which this would be impossible.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve Conclusion (l)  on page 3of the Appendix.(b) That the remainder of the report should be adjourned until the meetingof the Cabinet on Monday, 4th May,at 11.30 a.m.2, Whitehall Gardens, 3, tf&apos;.l. ,30th April, 1936.
cabinet COMMITTEE ON BROADCASTING.C ONCLU SIGNS AND RE G OMMEN DAT I OK S -(i)    It will &quot;be necessary in   the near future for the Postmaster-General to make astatement in the House of Commons ofthe Views of the Government on theUilswater Report.      For the purposes ofthis state nent decisions are req\iired onthe following matters affecting both therelations between the Corporation and theGovernment and also matters of internal administration and management fallingmainly outside the scope of government action.MATTERS AFFECTING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THECORPORATION AND GOVERNMENT.(a)    The new Charter of the Corporation,Ministerial control over the preparationof the new Charter should be fully maintained and the draft Charter should not be submittedto the Corporation until its text had beenapproved by the Cabinet.      Its terms shouldnot be the subject of negotiation with theCorporation^    . The,preparation of a draftnew Charter/will be undertaken as soon as theCabinet have reached decisions on our recommendations.      Copies of this draff,  in the formadopted by us,  will be circulated in due course to the Cabinet for approval,,(b )    Period, of Extension of Corporation^ Charter.The period of extension of the Charter shouldbe ten years.(c )   Number of Governors.The number of Governors should be increasedto seven and- the new Charter should repeat the present provision enabling the number of governors to be further increased by Order-in-Council.It will be advantageous to re-appoint someof the present Governors so as to secure con-discontinuity of administration.    The term of appoint-ment of future Governors should be for not morethan five years,(d)   Remuneration of Governors.Chairman andThe remuneration of/Governors should belaid down in the Charter and the respectiveamounts should, be as recommended in the Reportof the Ullswater Committee.APPENDIX;
In the course of his statement in the House ofCommons the Postmaster-General should emphasise the importance which the Government attach tothe duties and responsibilities of the chairman and other members of the Board of Governors.The functions and responsibilities of the Chairmanare such as normally to occupy most of his timeand his salary of  5,000 per annum has referenceto this consideration.(e) Government Control and Ministerial Responsibility.For the reasons set out on pages 4 and 5of our Report? we favour the continuance as atpresent by the Postmaster-General of his existingfunctions and we are opposed to the suggestion of the Ullswater Comdttee that the Postmaster-General should share his responsibility with aCabinet Minister in the House of Commons free from heavy Departmental duties and preferablya senior member of the Government.      This questionhowever,  is in our opinion one for the Cabinetto decide and we accordingly make no specific recommendation upon it.(f) Finance.The licence fee should remain at ten shillingsas at present.In our opinion the initial assignment to theCorporation of 75 per cent,   of the net licence revenue is fully justified,  and in view of thefuture needs of Television and Empire broadcasting services we do not dissent from the view thatthe Corporation have a case for some increaseof revenue.        We accordingly recommend that the charter should provide for the assignment to theCorporation of 75 per cent,  of the net licence revenue and that there should be added a carefullyworded provision   to be settled in consultationwith the Treasury   to the effect that it willbe possible for the Corporation to secure suchan increase of revenue beyond this 75 per cent,as the Treasury, having regard to the requirementsof Television and Empire Broadcasting and other services conducted by the Corporation, may approve
(g) The Future Status of the - Central council for School Broadcasting and the ScottishS pec i a1 Counc i1.In our view the fundamental  responsibilityfor allocating broadcasting time to this service must rest with the Corporation, andthis service must be financed out of theCorporation&apos;s share of the Licence revenue.The true standing of the Councils, howeverestablished, must be that of agjents of theCorporation empowered to act with completediscretion within certain limits defined bythe Corporation and as the Corporation itselfagrees,  subject to the over-riding responsibilityof the Corporation.(h) Empire Broadcasting,The development of Empire broadcasting shouldbe regarded as an important normal function ofthe broadcasting organisation, and this service as well as television broadcasting should beexpressly authorised in the new Charter.      Theadditional funds required will be providedby the Corporation from its increased shareof Licence revenue.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs is examining the question of the use in Empirebroadcasting of languages other than English.We have accordingly reserved this point for later consideration.( i)    Presentation of Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure.On the assumption that the duty of presentingestimates for broadcasting will remain withthe Postmaster-General, these estimates  should be presented separately from the Post Office estimates.(3)    Estimates of Capital Expenditure.We make no recomne hdation on this point which,in our view,  should be left for the Chancellorof the Exchequer to determine in consultationwith the Postmaster-General.(k)    &quot;Sponsored&quot; items.&quot;Sponsored&quot; items should not be allowed.(1)    Relay Exchanges.(1) Any suggestion that the Post Office should forthwith take over the ownership and operationof the relay system should be rejected.(2) For various reasons it is undesirable toreach a definite decision at the present time on the question whether the relay system shouldbe transferred at some later date to the PostOffice or not.      The postponement of a definite decision on this question will give time forexperience to be gained and experimental v/orkundertaken and should also enable a more correctestimate to be formed as to probable lines ofdevelopment than is possible at present.
(3)        Subject to stated in(4) &quot;below, extensione of lacenossmay &quot;be granted to existing relay undertakings andlicences may &quot;be granted to new undertakings to&apos; beterminable in all cases not later than 31st December1939, i.e. three years after the present licencesexpire..     It must &quot;be made clear to all existing andnew licensees that the Government retain completeliberty of action as from 31st December, 1939.In the meantime the Post Office should undertakeresearch, and experimental work.(4)        In addition to the present terms and provisions,conditions to the following effect should beinserted in all new licences and extensions of licences: PJX-(a) The relay services must reach a reasonable standard of efficiency in technical andother respects.(b) Undertakings which provide the choice of twoprogrammes must supply one B.B.C. programme at least during B.B.C. hours.NOTE.    In the case of existing relay undertakings,which at present only relay a single programme,the Postmaster-General is ascertaining whetherit would, be technically practicable for theundertaking concerned, without crippling itselffinancially, to make arrangements to give theirsubscribers the choice of two programmes.If so the undertaking might be given a reasonable period in which to make the necessary changes and it might then be made obligatory upon theundertaking to give its subscribers the choice of two programmes of which, during B.B.G. hoursone at least would be the B.B.C. programme.We defer making&apos; any recommendation on thismatter until we receive a Report from thePostmaster-General.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and. the Postmaster-General, while notdissenting from Conclusions 2-4 aboveinclusive, wish it to be placed on record that they would have preferred that adefinite decision should, have been taken nowto transfer the relay system to the PostOffice Rt some later date,  say the end of1939,(5)  &quot;    The Postmaster-General should make a statement to the following effect to the representatives ofthe relay undertakings.      This statement would apply equally to existing undertakings and to newundertakings:-In granting on certain conditions the extensionof the licensing system to 31st December, 1939,the Government are anxious not to fetter the discretion of the relay undertakings in regard totheir programmes, apart from the requirement thatduring B.B.C. hours at least one B.B.C. programme must be relayed.At the same time the Government see very greatobjection to the growth of advertising in certainprogrammes relayed from abroad.     The government hope that those responsible for relay under-takings will carefully bear in mind this expression of opinion, as, if the advertising practice growsto scandalous proportions, the Government may have -to take drastic action in regard to it.-4-
