GERMANY AND 1.    The Cabinet had before them a Note by theTHE LOCARNO ^ ^  . .n -    1in  ..fiUTREATY. Minister for Go-ordination of Defence (CP. 110 (.56JJcovering a Report received from the ServiceShe Staff , . .  1Conversations. representatives on the Staff Conversations, whichhad taken place with French and Belgian representa-&apos;Previous tives on April 15th and 16th.Reference:Cabinet 28 The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence(36) , Con- .elusion 3.) said he had now received a fuller record of the conversations at the War Office but not of those at theAdmiralty and Air Ministry.      A good many hypotheticalquestions had been asked and further information wasto be sent through the Service Attaches.      He drew attention to a point mentioned by the senior french military officer to the effect that France vrasperfectly well able to look after her own frontier and would prefer that any aid that might be given by great Britain should be sent to Belgium.The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attentionto an important fact that had been disclosed, namely,that the Belgian coast was totally undefended.The Secretary of State for Air gave the Cabinetsome details that had emerged from the conversations at the Air Ministry,  and undertook to send a full report to the Minister for the Co-Ordination ofDefence.      He raised for decision a question relatingto meteorological information.      At present in peacetime the French and British Air Forces relied largely on meteorological information collected from all overEurope and the Atlantic much of which would cease in.  time of war.      It was of the first importance that a plan should be in existence for replacing as far aspossible this information at any time of tension and
for exchanging information with the French.This matter had &quot;been raised in the course of the conversations, and it had been agreed to exchangethe information when the emergency arose, which was as far as the Air Staff had felt justified in goingunder their instructions.      The question on whichhe wished to consult the Cabinet was as to whether .this was to be regarded as planning or information.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To take note of the Report on theStaff Conversations (CP.  110 (36)),and to express their satisfactionat the manner in which the represen-tatives of the Staffs had carried out their instructions.(b) To take note that the Secretary ofState for Air would furnish a further report to the Minister for theCo-Ordination of Defence.(c) That the arrangements for concertingan exchange of meteorologicalinformation between the Governmentsconcerned should betreated as coming,under the heading of &quot;Information&quot;.
GERMANY ANDTHE locarno treaty.(previous reference:Cabinet 28 (36)Conclusion 2).31 fit,) 32.      The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that in the conversations at Geneva heand the Lord Privy Seal had been successful in securing their main objects, namely, that thereshould be no meeting ox the Locarno Powers beforethe French elections;    and that in the meantimea series of questions shotild be addressed to theGerman Government. The present position was thata questionnaire to Germany was being prepared inthe Foreign Office, and he hoped to report to theCabinet on the subject in the near future.      In themeantime, he asked his colleagues to considerwhether it might not be advisable, instead of sending the questions through the diplomatic channel,for a Cabinet Minister to take them to Berlin and discuss them with the German Government.      He was clear in his mind that he himself should not under-take this mission, and he proposed to reply to Pressinquiries that there was no prospect of this.At the next meeting of the Cabinet, however, he w4idask for a decision as to whether a member of theCabinet should not undertake the mission.The Cabinet agreed:That at their next regular weekly meeting the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should advise them as to the form of the approach to bemade to the German Government.- o -
THE ITALO-abyssinian dispute.(previous reference:Cabinet 27 (36)Cone lus i on 1).&apos;)      r. e.It fa) U-3.      The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsbegan by describing the general atmosphere at therecent meetings at Geneva in connection with the Italo-Abyssinian dispute.     Apart from therepresentatives of Portugal, Denmarlc and Australiawho shared our general view as to the importance ofthis matter from the point of view of the future ofthe League, hardly anyone had been thinking of abyssinia and Africa at all.      For the most part theyhad been dominated by thoughts of the reaction ofthese events on the European situation, according as their respective countries were mainly concernedwith Germany or Italy - the two dictator countries.The Spanish representative, for example, had been mainly concerned to prevent a Franco-British split.Yugoslavia and Turkey had been mainly concerned as tothe reaction of events in Abyssinia on Italy,and Russia and France on their reaction on Germany.France had only wanted the question settled so that italy might be in a position to play her part in european affairs, and M. Paul Boneour had actuallywanted to introduce a phrase to that effect into a communique.       Roumanians main preoccupation had been to keep the United Kingdom and France in agreement.In these circumstances, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs wanted his colleagues toconsider how far it was possible to make collective security work in Europe so long as the two Dictators,Mussolini and Hitler, dominated the situation.     Whilethat lasted every country was inclined to take its decision on every question according to the effect the decision would have on the Dictator in whom hewas interested.       France did not seem to fear that
the reaction of recent events might be to makeItaly a danger to Europe.     Apparently the Frenchdid not count on Italy for much aid,  out thoughtthat Italy had a great nuisance value, so they put up with things from Mussolini that would arouse themto great indignation in the case of Hitler.      Itmight well he that the next trouble with europe would arise over Austria, and that Italy might then become concerned over the Trentino.      In such an event was collective security likely to be effective in stopping Hitler?     He felt very doubtful.If not, was there really any collective securityat all?      No-one was likely to go out of their wayto defend Italy.Another point which the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs invited his colleagues to con-sider was the effect of the Italian success on theUnited Kingdom and British prestige generally.     he doubted if we should be left in peace for long,for example, over the question of Lake Tsana.If Italy was going to occupy the whole of Abyssiniawe might soon have difficulties in Egypt and theSudan.     Already signs were not lacking that certain sections of public opinion in Egypt nad been impressed by the forceful action of the Italians.Our prestige was bound to suffer, and had alreadysuffered, from these events.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs then referred to the only conversation he had had at Geneva with Baron Aloisi^in the couse of whichhe had drawn the Italian representative^ attention
to the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in his speech at Worcester that His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s actionin this dispute was in no sense anti-Italian hut onlya fulfilment of the obligations we bore -under theCovenant.     (See Telegram No.  143 of the 21st april to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Eome).       He had gained the impression that Baron Aloisi was personallyanxious to improve Aiiglo-Italian relations, but hewas a diplomat and better informed of the Europeansituation than most people in Italy.There followed a preliminary exchange of viewson the important questions mentioned by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.In the course of this discussion it wassuggested that even after the disappearance ofAbyssinian resistance the Italians would be in a veryunpleasant situation in occupation of a hostile,resentful and vindictive country.      It w ould be sometime before they could much reduce the garrison, andits maintenance would continue to drain the countryand its resources, particularly if the sanctionsfront could be maintained.      Much appeared to dependon whether the Italn.aiis could dictate peace before the rains, otherwise they might be faced with exhaustionand not be able to play much part in Europeanaffairs.      It might prove that the ke^ to thesituation lay in Western Europe.      It wab&apos; urged thatafter the French elections we should continue our policy ,of trying to bring the French and Germanstogether.      It might be that the Germans were notgenuine in their desire&apos; for a settlement, but it would
be wrong to allow our attitude to be governed bythis assumption.      If Germany could be brought backto the League of Nations it might have a great effecton Italy.The prime Minister said that he had in mind the possibility of establishing a small CabinetCommittee to consider the future of collective security and of the League of Nations, and he would bring thematter up for decision at the next regular weekly meeting.      In the meanwhile, he invited the attentionof his colleagues to the important considerationsraised by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and other Ministers in this preliminary discussion,and which would come up for further considerationnext week. One point which stood out from recent events was the necessity for pressing on with re-armament as rapidly as possible.
4.      The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he had received a proposal that the Empressof Abyssinia should be sent to Jerusalem.     as pointed out by some of his colleagues, the momentmight not be very favourable when there weredisturbances in Palestine, but, nevertheless,subject to the views of his colleagues, he proposedto offer facilities.The First Lord of the Admiralty said thathe was prepared to put a sloop at the disposal ofthe Empress to take her from Djibouti to Adenwhence she could travel to Palestine in a P. and 0.steamer.Some doubts v/ere expressed as to whetherit would be wise to allow the Empress to travel in a British merchant ship.      Public opinion in italy was in a state of excitement and  exaltation,and it seemed conceivable that a P.  and 0.  steamermight be interfered   with and searched, in which casean awkward incident might arise.      On the wholeit was thought better that the Empress&apos;   journeyshould be undertaken on board a British man-of-war which the Italians were unlikely to inferfere with.In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs read the draft telegram to Abyssinia which he had prepared.The Cabinet agreed:To approve in principle the proposal ofthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to give facilities for theEmpress&apos;  journey, and to leave detains to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the First Lord of theAdmiralty.- 8 -
BiNGLO-EGYPT IANTREATY NEGO-TIATIONS.(previous reference;Cabinet 28 (36)Conclusion 5).5.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he had nothing to raise until certain questions had been dealt with by the Committee ofImperial Defence.The Minister for the Co-Ordination ofDefence said that a Report from the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee was ready for consideration by theCommittee of Imperial Defence, and that someobservations had just been received by the Committeeof Imperial Defence from the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs...     He proposed that a meeting , -should take place in the near future.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to circulate an analysis of the presentposition of the Treaty negotiations.The Cabinet took note thatthe Committee of Imperial defence would hold a meeting at an earlydate to consider the positionof the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations.
REMOVAL OF PARTS)F THE ROYAL&amp;RDNANCE FACTORIES:SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES.previous reference:Cabinet 28 (36)Conclusion 10 (&amp;)).6.      In connection with the removal of the ordnance Factories, the Minister for theCo-Ordination of Defence pointed cut that upto the present time the Cabinet had only decidedthat the necessary sites should be purchased.As the removal was one of urgency and a greatdeal remained to be done, he hoped that theterms of reference to the proposed Committeewould be sufficiently wide to enable the completeproject to be worked out and proceeded with assoon as possible.The Cabinet agreed:That the Cabinet Committee on theremoval of parts of the Royal OrdnanceFactories from &quot;Woolwich, referredto in the Conclusion mentioned in the margin, should be composed asfollows:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer(or Financial Secretary to theTreasury),The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Health,The Minister for the Co-Ordinationof Defence,The Minister of Labour.The terms of reference were remitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Health who,immediately after the meeting of theCabinet, formulated the following:-To consider and make recommenda-tions to the Cabinet upon the steps necessary to carry out the transference of output fromWoolwich and Waltham to othersites as early as possible, andalso the measures required to effect the transfer with theleast possible amount of difficulty and hardship.
;trade MARKSBILL.(previous(Reference cabinet 51(35)5 Con-elusion 4.)7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP. 108 (36)),requesting authority for the preparation of a Billto give effect to the recommendations of a committee under the Chairmanship of Viscount G-oschen on thelaw and practice relating to trade marks.      So far as could be judged, the Bill would be non-controversial.It would be suitable for introduction in the House ofLords.The Cabinet approved the proposal ofthe President of the Board of Tradein CP.  108 (36)   aa   summarised above.
SHOPS  (SUNDAYTRADING RESTRIC-TION) BILL(previous reference:Cabinet 8 (36)Conclusion 12).8.      The Home Secretary reported that the bill had emerged from Committee in an improved formand was in a fair way to become a good Bill.The Secretary of State for Scotland reportedthat an attempt was likely to he made to extend theBill to Scotland.      This would have to he resistedand might involve some difficulties.It was suggested that the Debate on the Billought to he spun out sufficiently long to renderimpossible a division on the Marriage Bill but without blocking the Pilotage Authorities (Limitationof Liability) Bill.The Cabinet agreed:-That there was no objection to the shops (Sunday Trading Restriction)Bill being passed, and that theParliamentary Under-Secretaryof the Home Office should continue his present attitude towards it.
PILOTAGEAUTHORITIES(LIMITATIONOP LIABILITY)BILL.9.      The Cabinet accepted the view of thePresident of the Board of trade that it was desirable that thePilotage Authorities (Limitationof Liability) Bill should be passed.(previous reference:Cabinet 24 (36)Conclusion 11).2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.1.,22nd April, 1936.
