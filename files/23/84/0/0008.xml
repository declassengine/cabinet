PALESTINE.tablishmenta Legisla-ve Council.previous reference:Cabinet 3 656), Oon-clusion 6.)2 , The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-138 (3 6))circulating telegrams exchanged, with the Nigh Commis-sioner in Palestine.    In view of the situation disclosed therein it appeared, to the Secretary ofState that the only course now open to his  Majesty&apos;sGovernment was to set out clearly the original intention to receive an Arab Deputation and the subsequent proposal of T-Tis Majesty&apos;s Government forthe appointment of a royal.l Commission, conditionallyupon law anr! order having first been re-established,and. the fact that both these offers had been rejected by the Arab leaders, and to state that in thesecircumstances T;ris Majesty&apos;s Government had no alternative open to them but to make it perfectly clear that, while always rea.d.y to listen to anygrievances voiced either by Arabs or by Jews, it. was their firm intention to discharge to the full their responsibilities for Palestine and to carry out theirmandatory obligations in respect both of Arabs and of jews undeterred, by any attempts to deflect theirpolicy by means of threats of violence and. of civilu.i s obedience.At the outset of the Cabinet Meeting the Secretaryof State for the Colonies circulated the followingdocumentsA series of telegrams exchanged, betweenthe Secretary of State for the colonies and. the Nigh Commissioner for Palestine(Appendix I):A draft announcement (as settled, at theConference of Ministers held, at theHouse of Commons on May 14th at 10.20P*m.) &apos; Appendix II) .After reading the telegrams and. hearing from theSecretary of State for the Colonies a statement ofthe present position, the Cabinet agreed.  
1 K 9id 6(a) &quot;hat the following statement should he made in the House of Commons by theSecretary of State for the colonies the same afternoon in reply to aQuestion by Kr Gordon Macdonald.:-&quot;The High Commissioner has ma.dethe attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment quite clear to theArab leaders in Palestine.I wish to take this opportunityto state that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have been givingearnest, consideration to thesituation in Palestine resultingfrom the recent disturbances and.the continuing state of unrest. .The first necessity is the re-establishment of civil order,and the rTigh Commissioner is taking all necessary steps tothis end.    Subject to this, T-TisMajesty&apos;s Government have decidedthat the suggested Arab deputation to London would no longer meet theconditions which have arisen, and.that instead, it is desirable thatan Inquiry on the spot should, beundertaken.    They have thereforedecid.ed., after ord.er is restored.,to appoint a Royal commission which, without bringing intoquestion the terms of the Mandate,will investigate causes of unrest and alleged grievances either of arabs or Jews&quot;.(b) that insomuch as the High Commissionerhad. already communicated, to the Arableaders in Palestine the intention ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to appoint a.Royal Commission, there would, no longer be any objection to a similar communica&apos;tion being made to Dr, vVeizmann, theHead, of the Jewish Agency, before theannouncement in Parliament, and thatit would be desirable for the Secretaryof State to see him with this objectas soon as possible after the Meetingof the Cabinet .
THE italo-ABYSSINTANDISPUTE.position ofthe Fleet inthe EasternMe&apos;1 iterranean(previous reference:Cabinet 3 5(36), Con-clusion 3 ,)3 . In accordance with the Conclusion mentioned.in the margin, the Cabinet had. under consideration the question of the position of the Fleet in theEastern Mediterranean, and. had. before them a Memo-randum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP.-134(36))  in which he drew attention to the Admiralty&apos;difficulties in connection with the personnel of theNavy, recommissionings, training, etc., arising outof the unexpected continuance of the present state ofemergency in the Mediterranean.    Today there was practically no margin on which to work to keep thenormal routine going, an-&quot; the time had a.rrived whenthe situation must be solved, in one of two ways(l) That our commitments in the ^editer-ranean should be liquidated, and theFleet, thereby enabled, to return toits normal peace-time routine ofrecommissionings and. training&quot;.(S) That it should be recognised, that though we are not at war, the Fleetis being kept on a war footing, andthe Admiralty should be authorised,to call up sufficient reserve men toenable them again to place the manning situation on a satisfactory basis.After the Ca.binet had. heard, from the First Lordof the Admiralty further particulars of the diffi-culties of the Admiralty in maintaining the fleet in the Mediterranean and of the desirabilitythat the Australian and New ZealandCruisers SYDNEY and AGNILLES should return to theirrespective Dominions, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs urged strongly that the present time was still very inopportune for giving any impressionto the world that we were weakening our position inthe Mediterranean.   T-Te hoped, therefore, that theFirst Lord of the Admiralty would, be allowed, to callup the additional men required to maintain theFleet in the -Mediterranean.
In the course of the discussion the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence mentioned that, from a conversation with the Chiefs of Staff, he had gathered that strategically the Mediterranean. Fleet was. themain factor of safety for our interests in the Med.it.er-ranean.    The rainy season, however, was coming on in abyssinia and. the adjacent countries, so that until october any attacks in those quarters from Abyssiniawere unlikely.    It would, so to speak, probably be aquiet period from this point of view .The First Lord said, it was our Capital Ships thatgave us our superiority in the Mediterranean.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was glad to hear of our superiority in the Mediterranean,because apparently no other country believed in it.Tjre hoped that there might be some plain speaking onthis subject in the Debate next Thursday-.AThile the ob objections to the weakening of theposition in the Mediterranean at the present, juncturewere fully recognised, it was suggested that possibly the needs of the Wavy might be met by some lessdrastic measure than the calling up of some 6,000pensioners, all in employment, as proposed in theFirst Lord&apos;s Memorandum.Various suggestions were offered, e.g.:-(l) That the calling for volunteers fromthe Reserve for service in the Fleet,adopted last autumn, should, not be confined to one particular moment&apos;,but should be a continuous process .(2) To invite all men due for dischargeto re-engage during the present-emergency .(3) Some temporary enlistment schemewhereby seamen or other men withsea experience (for example, in the fishing fleet, where there is muchunemployment) might be enlisted to be trained on boa^d. ship:    in other&apos;words, a system..,,. of dilution such as\it was understood, had been adoptedin the War 1914-1918.
The Cabinet agreed.  That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows  The Chancellor of the Exchequer(or representative),The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence,The Parliamentary under-Secretary,Foreign Office  should, meet to consider the best wayof meeting the personnel difficultiesof the Fleet in the Mediterranean.
itatjO-abysstnianDlSPUmE.&quot;Dum-dum&quot;Bullets,(previous reference:Cabinet 34(5 6), Con-clusion 4.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs warned his colleagues that he proposed to make astatement in Parliament the same afternoon on theItalian allegations as. to the supply of &quot;dum-dum&quot;bullets from this country to Abyssinia.    The statement would be very damaging to the Italian Embassy, andthere might be a serious reaction in Rome.   He felt,

The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsIpysstntam[DISPUTE, said that on enquiry he had established, that we hadmftxQ Emperor&apos;s       not the right to keep the Emperor of Abyssinia inBfoyements .[ Palestine.    It was not clear, either, how we were to(Previous prevent him coming to this country if he wished.I Referenc e :Cabinet 33 The question then arose as to the route by which he(36) ,  Con-conclusion 2.) should travel,    The first alternative was the overland.FR.3S^3&amp;)/rout e, but this was difficult as arrangements wouldhave to be made in so many, countries .    nhe second,alternative was by sea, either in a liner or a warship*If in a British liner there was danger that, theItalians might try to stop him, and it would be veryawkward if they did.In the course of the discussion a suggestion wasmade that it might be advisable for the Emperor to travel on board a French rather than a British liner,as there was less risk of the Italians trying to intercept him.    ^he risk of the stoppage of a Britishliner, however, was not rated very high.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the Emperor would have to be encouraged to travelincognito.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be authorisedto inform the Emperor that we shouldd.o nothing to prevent his departure from Pa.lestine, or a visit to thiscountry, but, that he must make hisown arrangements for the journey:(b) That a Cruiser could not be placed,at the disposal of the Eraperor of abyssinia.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attentionto Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s Personal Telegram No .418 ofthe 13th May, from which it appeared that both heand the Officers and. Officials engaged with him inthe Egyptian conversations had very little under-standing of the Cabinet&apos;s policy.FR.3^3.4)3.

APPENDIX       I.75156,PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State  for theColonies to the High Commissioner for Palestine.Sent 3.  0 p.mo 15th May,  1936-IMMEDIATE.Private and Personal.My private and personal telegram of 14th May.To assist Cabinet on Monday morning in considering questionof public statement regarding situation I shall be glad ifyou will immediately inform me whether from the point of viewof reactions in Palestine you see any objection to thestatement containing reference to the fact that you havealready communicated to Arabs terms of Government&apos;sconditional proposal that a Royal Commission should beappointed and that Arab leaders have rejected this proposal..
MOST IMMEDIATE.Private and Personal.With reference to your telegram of the 15th May.      the communication which I made in accordance with your instructionsto the Arab leaders was made in strict confidence which theyhave hitherto respected and I regard their reply? whether oralor writtens as equally confidential.      I should he accused ofbreach of confidence if their reply were made&apos;public andthere would be serious reactions in Palestine.2.      In any case statement that &quot;proposal had been rejected by Arab leaders&quot; would be misleading.      I referred to this not as a proposal but in accordance with authority given in yourtelegram 13th of May as a decision of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentnamely to set up a Royal Commission when civil order had been-establishedo3.      I was told by Arab leaders that they would Yfelcome a royal Commission and one member stated he regarded theappointment of such a Commission as duty of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.      But they state9 both to me and in their writtenreply.,  that Arab people would not agree to abandon thestrike on this basis alone and without a temporary stoppage of immigration.      Their reply was not intended as a rejection of His Majesty&apos;s Governments decision to appoint RoyalCommission nor do I regard it as such.4.      It is important that position of Arab leaders shouldbe understood.     A demand was pressed upon them from all Arabquarters in Palestine that strike should continue untilimmigration had been stopped and this they foolishly endorsedin excitement of first few days of disorder.      They thoughtthat as Sir Herbert Samuel had stopped immigration afterPARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner for palestine to the Secretary of State for the ColoniescDated 16th May9  1936.

disorders of 1921 I would accept this demand.      They v/eremistaken.      But leaders are at present powerless to stop the strike unless immigration is suspended as feeling of Arabs is now so strong.      Sooner or later wisercounsels will prevailo      But that is the position to-day.5.      Yesterday an appeal to  the public to resort topeaceful methods and to avoid violence was published tothe public by Committee of  Ten?    they have howeverrecommended no payment of taxes.      I am still being urged by Jewish papers to take legal action against the Committeeof Ten.      I feel it would be unwise to do so&apos;at presentsI have consulted Chief Justice and I realise it mightbe difficult to secure satisfactory sentences?      acquittalswould have worst results.      There would be direct instigationto violence instead of an appeal to adopt peaceful methodsif present leaders were convicted.Go      I am completely confident in my ability to suppressquickly any organised rioting?    I am reluctant;, however,to take steps the effect of which would be to increaseisolated attacks on Jews,  arson, bomb throwing,,  etc.,which are inherently more difficult to stop.7.      We shall succeed sooner or later in restoring normalconditions.      Royal Commission will then be of the gratest value as enabling His Majesty&apos;s Government to judge betweenJewish and Arab claims and so help to prevent repetition of disorderso      It is the genuine belief of both Arabs and Jews that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not carrying out their obligations under Article 2 and Article 6 of Mandate5and until a thorough and impartial investigation of thesequestions of which by far the most difficult and complexis immigration, has been made,  there can be no lasting peace in Palestine.     Till then we can only expectincreasing dissatisfaction on the part of both Arabs and
Jewso      My advisers including Commissioner of migration share my views that an independent enquiry is essential since apart from political issues thepractical difficulty of immigration has become socomplex.     Message ends.
PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner forPalestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 16th May 1936.      Received 2.57 p.m. 9  16th May.IMMEDIATE,Private and personal.I have learned since despatching my telegram ofthis morning that Egyptian newspaper has published anarticle recommending appointment of a Royal commission for Palestine,      Much comment and enquiry&apos;is beingcaused here by this.PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for theColonies to the High Commissioner for Palestine,Sent 5,15 p.m, 16th Mays 1936,MOST IMMEDIATE.Private and Personal.Your, telegram of 16th May,      Should be glad to learn whether disclosure of your conversations with arabs and of their reactions as reported in this morningfsTimes by special correspondent at Jerusalem affects your views as to reference to your confidential discussions with Arabs.     Ends,
PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner forPalestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 17th May 1936c       Received 2.42 a.m. 17th May.MOST IMMEDIATE.Private and Personal.Your telegram 16th May.      I have no reason to suppose that responsibility for disclosures which mayindeed have been no more than intelligent deduction fromArticle in Egyptian Press9  can be attributed to anymember of council of Ten.      But in the circumstances Iwill9 if you see no objection^  inform council of ten thatHis Majesty&apos;s Governments decision as to a RoyalCommission need no longer be regarded as secret.I again emphasise fact that I stated to leadersthat this was    a decision of H.M.Government and not aproposal.      Also that I definitely do not regard their reply as rejection.      On the contrary that Arab leaderswelcome decision I have no doubt.
APPENDIX    II.DRAFT ANNOUNCEMENT.(As settled at Conference of Ministers held atHouse of Commons, on May 14th., at 10.20 p.m.)His Majesty&apos;s Government have &quot;been giving earnestconsideration to the situation in Palestine resulting from therecent disturbances and the continuing state of unrest.The first necessity is the re-establishment of civil order and I must make it plain that HisMajesty&apos;s Government will not be deflected by threats of any kind from discharging this duty to the whole population.Subject to this, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that,instead of the suggested Arab Deputation to London, an Inquiryon the spot is desirable, and they intend, after law and orderare restored, to appoint a Royal Commission which, withoutI the terms of the Mandate \ .bringing into question     -.    . , . , ., . in anyjtneir International obligations!way, will investigate causes of unrest and alleged grievanceseither of Arabs or of Jews.throughout palestine in the areas affected
