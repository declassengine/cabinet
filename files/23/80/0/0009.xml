SAAR. 1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP..-261deviousinference: (34)) on a number of pending questions and difficul-Catinet 69(33) ^ Con- ties relating to the Saar.     The Secretary of Stateelusion 3 (g) ..)did. not ask for any Cabinet decisions at the moment,but the situation was so anxious that he had preparedan outline of the facts in ease sudden and special cabinet consideration became necessary.The Cabinet were informed by the Secretary .ofState for Foreign Affairs that it had been foundnecessary to postpone the meeting at Geneva of the saar Committee, and that this meeting would, probably not take place before Monday next.   The Secretary ofState had. invited the Lord Privy Seal to confer withMr Knox at Geneva on the general situation.   Hithertoour representatives at Geneva had abstained, fromconference with Mr Knox because of his internationalposition as Chairman of the Saar Commission, but it seemed pedantic to pursue this attitude in the presentcircumstances.    Special steps had been taken to make enquiries in regard to Mr Khox&apos;s personal safety, andit was hoped that the results of these enquiries would,be received in a day or two.In the course of discussion, general agreement was expressed with the view that it would be most undesir-able to entertain the suggestion of M. Laval that ifFrench troops were sent into the Saar there should be .a &quot;token&quot; British contribution to indicate the inter-national character of the force.   The Cabinet werewarned that any such participation as was suggestedby the French would certainly lead us into a positionof grave difficulty and embarrassment.The Cabinet were informed of the steps now beingtaken by Mr Knox to recruit a small force of police,
most of the members of which would be raised withinthe Saar, and the remainder abroad.   Up to the present only two or three recruits had been obtained in theUnited Kingdom,   The question was raised whether,having regard to the fact that police on theContinent could not be said to be reliable, and thatany cosmopolitan police force now recruited must beinexperienced and untrained to deal with mobs, itwas right that a police force should be expected tobe able to deal with a Nazi &quot;Putsch&quot;, and whetherthe Foreign Office had considered what would haveto be done if the situation got out of the hand ofthe police?    Should soldiers have to be sent?On the other hand, the difficulty was pointed outof determining the country from which the military force should come-     It would be out of the question to ask Germany to provide troops for the purpose,and if troops were brought into the Saar from any country other than Germany a very grave situation would at once arise.    In this connection the question was asked whether, if Germany suggested that Britishtroops should be sent to the Saar to keep order, weshould       absolutely refuse to entertain the sugges-tion?Attention was drawn to the fact that, notwithstand-ing the important British financial interests involved,the United Kingdom was not represented at the meetings of Baron Alois!&apos;s Committee in Rome,   Itwas pointed out, however, that this Committee would report to Geneva, where the effective discussion ofits proposals would take place.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note of the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairsf CP.-3 61 (S4)) and to invite theSecretary of State to make a further report to the Cabinet if, in his
opinion, the situation in the Saarshowed signs of further deterioration(h) To invite the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and thePresident of the Board of Tradeto confer on the steps to betaken to safeguard British financial interests in the Saar when   theReport of Baron Aloisi&apos;s Committeeis considered at Geneva.
-AFRtfA^ RR- 2. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to awr&quot; number of recent indications that German re-armament(Previous was proceeding in an alarming manner.    For example,Tbefer enG e:cabinet 40 reference was made to information supplied by the/), Con-llusiori 1-) Norwegian Minister of Justice to our Minister at0.- 2Oslo regarding large German orders placed in Norwayfor whale oil, lard, nickel and molybdenum.    (See.P.O. Telegram No .6,1^ of No\rember 16th. 1954.)   Anotherindication was the arrangements which Germany was making to obtain an oil reserve, which had been thesubject of discussion at the previous Meeting of theCabinet &apos;Cabinet 40 (34), Conclusion 10).In the course of discussion the Cabinet were reminded that this subject was certain to be raised inthe course of the Debate on the Address in connectionwith our general Defence requirements.   All theavailable evidence showed, that German re-armament had reached a very formidable stage.    In a very short&apos;timeGermany would possess an army of 300,000 men, asagainst an army of 100,000 allowed her by the Treatyof Versailles.   There was reason to believe that ina year&apos;s time she would have as large an air force asthe United Kingdom.   When the available information had been collected it would be necessary for theCabinet to consider the very important question whether we ought to abandon our policy of ignoring Germany&apos;transaction in regard to re-armament.   Our information wasto the effect that the German authorities were afraid that the Versailles Powers would jointly accuse germany of violating the Treaty.   If such action were takenmow, Hitler&apos;s prestige might be affected:   but with every month which passed, Germany was becoming strongerand. therefore better able to disregard such complaints.The view was also expressed that in the very importantBebate In the House of Commons in the following week
it would be necessary for the Government not onlyto announce their general attitude towards Germanre-armament, but also to give more detailed, informa-tion than had been published, at present in regard, tothe proposals for the expansion of the Royal Air PoreGeneral agreement was expressed with the viewthat it was desirable that a small Committee of theCabinet should be appointed to bring together theavailable facts and figures with regard to Germanre-armament, and also to make definite proposals tothe Cabinet as to the line to be taken in the forth-coming Debate in the House of Commons.   In thisconnection the Committee should advise the Cabineton the desirability of re-considering our policy asregards the legalisation of German re-armament, ife.:-(i) Should we agree to its legalisation?(ii) If we are not prepared to recogniseIt as legitimate, how do we proposeto proceed -(a) If Germany demands legalisation,and.(b) If Germany discards all attempts.at secrecy and officially announcesher re-armament,After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed.  (a) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows  The Prime Minister,mhe Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,The Secretary of State for India  should be appointed&apos;to consider thequestion of German re-armament, andin particular to bring together theavailable facts and figures regardingsuch re-armament and to make definite proposals to the Cabinet as to our future policy concerning the legalisationof German re^armament, on the lines ofthe discussion summarised in this conclusion:fb) That a Special Meeting of the cabinet should be held on MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26th,to consider the Report of the aboveCabinet Committee, and that everyeffort should be made to ensure thatcopies of the Report of the Committee
are circulated to the Cabinet not later than Saturday, November 34th:mo take note that the Prime Ministerand. the Lord President of the council would confer in regard to the GovernmenSpokesman in the forthcoming Debate inthe house of Commons .
REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.&quot;(previous reference!Cabinet 40(54), Con-clt3S ion 2 ,)FA-3. No discussion took place on the subject of reduction and Limitation of Armaments, but the acting Secretary to the Cabinet was instructed, tokeep it on the Agenda Paper,
OILINDUSTRYtji JAPAN ANDANCHURIA.control of.4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-863(34)) regarding the control of the oil industry in japan and Manchuria,   So far as Japan was concerned,the Japanese Government had passed a law having as its main objects the accumulation of large reserves of oil,obviously to meet a war emergency, and the encouragement of the refining of oil in Japan.   This law gave theJapanese Government extensive powers of control overthe industry.   The principal. British oil Interestinvolved was the Asiatic Petroleum Company, which, ifit complied with the law, would, have to incur an expenditure of some  2,500,000 on the erection ofadditional storage tanks and accessory plant, and. onthe Increase of current oil stocks to about three timestheir present volume.    By the exercise of the powersallowed under the law, the Japanese Government mightactually prevent the Company from recouping themselvesOilfor this large expenditure.   The British/Companies were now considering the desirability of threatening to withhold supplies as a means of pressure on JapanrIn this event the support of His MajestyTs Governmentwould, be essential:but this threat Dtould not be effective unless theAmerican and the Dutch East Indies Oil Companies joinedwith the backing of their own Governments,   TheSecretary of State then set forth the arguments for and against this policy, and. the political results thatmight follow its adoption.   In Manchuria an even moreobjectionable situation had arisen, where the institution of a Government monopoly of sales of oil was imminent,together with the creation of a Manchurian Oil Company,80% of whose capital would be Japanese, thus infringingthe Open Door principle and various Treaty provisionsforbidding monopolies in China.-R-
In the course of disc-us s ion the Cabinet werewarned that very great care would have to beexercised in regard to this matter.    For example,it was not at all clear that if the British oil companies took the action proposed, the AmericanOil Companies would not offer to accept the Japaneseterms and obtain the trade at our expense.General agreement was expressed with the viewthat in any event there could be no question of theBritish Government paying compensation or in any wayindemnifying the British Oil Companies for any damagethey might sustain by withholding, or threatening to withhold, supplies of oil as a means of pressure on japan.It was suggested that any discussions with theBritish Oil Companies should proceed on the assumptionthat the transaction proposed was a purely commercialone, but that it was recognised, that it had a nationalaspect in regard to which the British government thought it desirable to consult with the Governmentof the United States of America, and also possiblyof Holland.The suggestion was made that the Oil Companiesmight point out that a result of the withholding ofsupplies by them might be the seizure of their,undertakings in Japan.    In this event they might ask whether the Government would, give them diplomaticsupport.    It was pointed out that the reply to thisquestion must depend on whether there had or had notbeen a breach of our Commercial Treaty with Japan,and that in any event the question was a hypotheticalone which the Government could not be expected.to answer at the present stage.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the British Oil companies should be informed that theGovernment would raise no objec-tion to their proposal that, should it appear necessary to do so and ifsatisfaction cannot be obtained inany other way, the British Companiesmay have to threaten to withholdsupplies of oil as a means of pressure on Japan:(b) That enquiries should be made throughthe usual diplomatic channels with aview to ascertaining what advice theGovernment of the United States ofAmerica were giving to the AmericanOil Companies in regard to thisquestion of putting pressure on Japanby threatening to withhold suppliesof oil from her:(c) ^o take note that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs proposedto act in this matter in close consultation with the Secretary ofState for the Colonies and the&quot; Presidentof the Board of Trade.
I naval conference.1935.&apos; previous&apos; Reference:Cabinet 40  (34),Conclusion 3).5.    With reference to the conclusion mentioned,in the margin, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs outlined to the Cabinet the interview whichhe had had with the Japanese Ambassador on November19th, an account of which is contained in theSecretary of State&apos;s despatch to the british ambassador at Tokyo, No. 720.      Copies of this despatch were circulated to the Cabinet immediately before the meeting.General agreement was expressed with theview that it would be disastrous if the negotiationsbroke down at the present juncture, and that accordingly every effort should be made to continue discussions with the Japanese until it was clearbeyond possibility of doubt that there was no hopeof reaching any satisfactory agreement.In this connection, attention was drawn tothe remarks of Mr. Matsudaira regarding the mission of Mr, Yoshida,        On a previous occasion theCabinet had been informed that Mr, Yoshida was coming to England as the bearer of a highly important communication.      it now appeared that hewas merely making a tour of a number of Europeancapitals.      It seemed unlikely that Mr. Yoshidawas the bearer of instructions to break off thediscussions, but was it not possible that he had brought with him proposals for a settlement which mr. Matsudaira thought it politic to reserve for the present in the hope of obtaining better terms?The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet, however,  that, this was notthe impression which he had obtained fromMr. Matsudaira&apos;s references to Mr. Yoshida&apos;s mission.-11-
The Cabinet took note of the interviewbetween the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the japanese ambassador as summarised in the former&apos;despatch to Sir R. Clive of the19th November, 1934.
he Cabinet had before them the followingts on the subject of the Private ManufactureTrading in. Armst-A draft Statement (C .P .-260 (34))suggesting the line that should, be .taken in Parliament, drawn up asthe result of discussions in the ministerial Committee on Disarma-merit:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-263(34))  on the possibility of formulat-ing Terms of Reference for an Inquiry,embodying a suggestion by the Solicitor-General for securing the necessarylimits to an Inquiry, and outlininghis own procedure in the House ofCommons if the suggested method of setting up an Inquiry was satisfactory to his colleagues.Considerable discussion took place in regard: - &apos;to the question of the Inquiry.        General agreement was expressed with the view that the solutionsuggested in CP, 263 (34) by the Solicitor-general would not meet the case.     At the same time,emphasis was laid on the widespread anxiety onthis subject which it was contended could best beallayed by the offer of an Inquiry.      If the inquiry was conducted by persons in whom the publichad entire confidence there should be no serious riskof the disclosure of information directly or indirectly prejudicial to the public interest.On the other hand, the Cabinet were again remindedby the Secretary of State for War of the view ofthe Service Departments that the private manufactureof arms was imperative from the point of view ofour national security.        In the opinion of those departments with which he, the Secretary of State,agreed, no kind of Inquiry would satisfy publicopinion unless it disclosed secret information andsubjected our manufacturers to criticism and-13-KF PRIVATEANUFACTUREOP.

obloquy and had the effect of handing over their business to the foreigner.        In brief, such an inquiry would not meet the popular demand or,  if it didmeet it, it would gravely damage the cause ofimperial defence.In the course of discussion the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs suggested that in theforthcoming debate in the House of Commons he shouldoutline the proposals which the Government intendedto make at Geneva, and that he should then repeat the remarks he had made in the debate on November 8thin regard to a suggested Inquiry, intimating thatthe armaments industry, like other industries,undoubtedly produced cases of improper and irregularconduct which must be reprobated by everyone.The Inquiry would consider whether a State monopolyfor the manufacture of arms and munitions was afeasible proposition.     Assuming that the system ofprivate manufacture of arms tends to some abuse,will this abuse be got rid of by substitutinga State monopoly for private manufacture or is there any other way by which the difficulty could be overcome? He would conclude his speech by a reference to our arrangements for the control ofthe arms traffic.After some further discussion, the cabinet agreed:(a) To accept in principle that there should bean Inquiry held in the United Kingdom.(b) To invite the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to prepare terms ofreference of the proposed Inquiry, and tosettle such terms of reference in consulta-tion with the Prime Minister, the lord president of the Council and the Secretaryof State for War.
(c) That the proposed terms of reference of the United Kingdom Inquiry should bein general accord with the terms suggested in Cabinet 39 (34) conclusion  (a) and (b), and that, in addition,the Commission of Inquiry should ineffect be invited to suggest whether anything could be done to limit theabuses and minimise the evilsincidental to the private manufacture ofarms and munitions.(d) That the Commissionof Inquiry should if&apos; pu^ilblo bepresided over by a distinguishedmember of the Judicial Bench who should do assisted by two other strong,impartial and independent persons.The following amendments to CP. 260 (34)were adopted by the; Cabinet:Page 2, paragraph 4, line 17, after &quot;represent&quot;insert &quot;substantially&quot;.Page 3, paragraph 7, line 4, for &quot;complete&quot;substitute &quot;very full&quot;.Page 4, paragraph 9 to read as follows:&quot;As regards export, we already have asystem of licensing in this country which would enable us to make regularreturns of all material exported.&quot;Page 6, delete sentence beginning &quot;If itwere alleged on responsible authority&quot; to &quot;falsityof that charge&quot; at end of paragraph.The First Lord of the Admiralty informed theCabinet that he had sent to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs certain other amendmentsdesigned to strengthen the draft paragraphs.The President of the Board of Educationstated that he had examined the amendments in question and agreed that    they were improvements.      Hesuggested that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should incorporate these amendments inany paragraphs which he might use from the statement in the speech.
Cabinet agreed:To approve as the basis of thestatement to be made in the forth-coming debate in the House ofCommons by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs the draft annex to CP. 260 (34) subject to the alterations and amendments adoptedby the Cabinet and summarised above.
7.       With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet had before them aNote by the Lord Chancellor (C.P. 233 (34))containing &quot;the following draft Terms of reference of the proposed Inquiry into the state of? in the King&apos;s Bench Division:-&quot;To inquire into the state ofbusiness in the King&apos;s Bench Divisionof the High Court of Justice and toreport whether, with a view to greaterdespatch, any reforms should be adopted,and in particular what is the judicialstrength required to deal with thebusiness, whether there should be anyfurther fusion or further sub-divisionof the Divisions of the Supreme Court,whether any alterations should be madein the Circuits of the Judges, whether any further measure should be taken for the devolution of work from theHigh Court to the County Court, andwhether a retiring age should be imposed upon those appointed in thefuture to the Bench of the SupremeCourt.&quot;The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinetthat the proposed Inquiry would be by means of a royal Commission of which he suggested thefollowing composition j-The Rt.
