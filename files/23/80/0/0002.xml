parliamentary business.iPate of Proro-gation and opening ofParliament.(previous reference:Cabinet SO(34), Con-elusion 1.)to.1.   The Cabinet were reminded that in July lastit had been provisionally agreed that Parliament shouldbe prorogued on November 16th and that the   new sessions should open, on November 20th.   The date of the RoyalWedding was fixed for November 29th, and it was nowdesirable to confirm November 16th as the date forProrogation, and November 20th as the date for theOpening o* the new Session.Parliament would re-assemble on Tuesday, October30th, and between that date and the date of Prorogationon November 16th it would be necessary to deal withthe BETTING BILL, THE INCITEMENT TO DISAFFECTION bill and the ELECTRICITY (SUPPLY) BILL, which last bill had already   passed through all its stages in the Houseof Lords.    It would be necessary to give two days ofthe 14*? available days to the Opposition, one for a debate on the Depressed Areas, and the other for a debate on Disarmament, with special reference to therevelations at the Inquiry by a Committee of the Senateat Washington into the activities of the private armsfirms ,   This would leave 12% days for Government business,and it might be necessary to abandon the Electricity(Supply) Bill, although the Government would be very reluctant to adopt such a course.   The situation wasgoverned by the Betting Bill, and concessions on that bill might have to be contemplated.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the date of the Prorogation ofParliament should, be November 16thand the date of the Opening of the19 34-35 Session of Parliament shouldhe November 20th:(b) To take note that the Prime minister would confer with the Home secretary in regard to the&apos;Betting Bill.
PARLIAMENTARY S. The Cabinet were informed that the 1934-35USI^ES-. Session of Parliament was likely to be an exceptionallyferithe*&apos;i0n heavy one from the point of view of Government business.Parliamentary and that the period from the re-assembling after theOpe o\OV .&quot; Christmas Recess to the Easter Adjournment would be(Previous mainly devoted to the INDIA BILL and financial business.Ref e^erc e *Cabinet 34 It would be necessary to take all Private Members&apos; time,(Z4 )   0 on-elusion 1.) and it was proposed to take the India Bill in Committeeon.the Floor of the House of OommonB for two days ineach week.    In view of these considerations the PrimeMinister invited members of the Cabinet to restrict tothe barest possible minimum the number of Bills which their Departments proposed to bring forward in the1934-35 Session, and pointed out that very   little, ifany, time would be available in the Session for ordinaryDepartmental Bills, with one or two exceptions, suchas the HOUSING BILL and the  SHIPPING BILL,both of which should be introduced and read a second time before the Christmas Recess.In conclusion the Prime Minister informed theCabinet that he would supplement this preliminarystatement on Government Business by a further report at a later Meeting.

icttt; ASSASSIN/1-- 5. The Cabinet were informed by the Secretary offCois OP KINGALEXANDER OP     State tfor Foreign Affairs that it was as yet too earlyIJGO-SLAVIA AND&apos;)P Mf BARTHOU, to estimate the probable outcome of the shocking events1HF! french foreign MINISTER^ at Marseilles on the previous day when King Alexander,       of Yugo-Slavia and M. Barthou, the Foreign Minister ofFrance,- had been assassinated by a Croat fanatic.With regard to the internal reactions in Yugo-Slavia it must be remembered that King Alexander wasnot only the King of Yugo-Slavia but also in a very real sense its Government.   There was at present no material on which to predict what might happen.   TheCroats wanted autonomy, while the politicians wished, for a return to Constitutional Government,   Possiblysome military Junta might govern the country under aRegency during the minority of the new King,With regard to external reactions, an abusiveoutburst by Yugo-Slavia Press against France might havebeen anticipated in view of the cooling of relationsbetween the two countries, but M, 9art&apos;hou&apos;s death mighthave some moderating effect in this connection.Yugo-Slavia had recently been showing signs of flirtingwith Germany, but it was most improbable that therewas any real substance in these overtures.   There wasno reason to think that Yugo-SlaviaTs neighbours (withpossibly one exception) would, seize the present opportunity-nity to intervene.    The possible exception was Italy,and it was very fortunate that our Minister at Belgradehad obtained a promise from King Alexander, Just priorto his departure for France, that the abusive Ytigo-Slavian Press campaign against Italy should be stopped.He (the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs) had seen the Italian Ambassador and had strongly repre-sented the desirability of stopping the abuse ofYugo-Slavia in the Italian Press ,    If the Kingdom ofYxigo-Slavia showed sighs of breaking up, the Italian
Government might try to strengthen their position by such action as moving the Italian Fleet to the dalmatian Coast.   At the moment there was nothinguseful that we could do. and he had already conveyed to the French and Yugo-Slavian authorities thecondolences o^ His Majesty&apos;s Government on the deathsof V: * Bar thou and. King Alexander,&apos;The Cabinet were informed that the Court would go into monrning until October 29nd,The Cabinet agreed  To request the Prime Minister, inconsultation with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, to arrangefor Ministers to represent His Majesty&apos;aGovernment at the Memorial Services tobe held in London for King Alexanderand M, Barthou.

The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composedasfollovmheTheTheTheThe&apos;S  P-^ime ^inisteT&apos;.Lord President of the Council,Chancellor of the Exchequer,Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,First&apos;Lord of the Admiralty  should consider the position in regardto the forthcoming preliminary discus-scions with the Japanese Delegation tothe Naval Conference, and should settle the United Kingdom representation and give instructions as to the line which our representatives should take at thediscuss ions,35
DISARMAMENT.?he Privatevrmamentsindustry.previous reference:cabinet 70 (33)lonclusion 22).mm-6.      The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the probability that when Parliament reassemblesthe Opposition would demand a debate on the PrivateArmaments Industry with special reference to therevelations in the enquiry by a Committee of the senate of the United States of America.      It wasvery important that the line to be taken by theGovernment in this debate should be carefully considered in advance.The Cabinet agreed -To refer this question for examination and report to the Ministerial Committeeon Disarmament.
7. With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs invited the attention of the Cabinet to his Despatch(A 7961/1938/45) of the 8th October, 1934, to HisMajestyVs Ambassador at Tokyo, containing an accountof a discussion with Mr Matsudaira, the japanese ambassador in London.
SERMANY.?rade Negotia-;ions with,^previous reference:Cabinet 33 (34)Conclusion 3).8.      With regard to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin on the subject of Trade Negotiationswith Germany, the Cabinet were informed that therehad been no fresh developments in the interval.The representatives of the Lancashire cotton trade had, at the outset, been somewhat critical of theline which the Government had taken at Berlin, butat a meeting on the previous day at the Board ofTrade with representatives of the Lancashire cotton trade,  the Yorkshire woollen industry and thecoalexport trade, after hearing a statement bySir Frederick Leith-Ross, with which therepresentatives in question were entirely satisfied,the final conclusion was that the industries concerned would be well-advised to leave themselvesin the hands of the Government in this matter.The way was now open for the resumption of negotiations at Berlin for a limited Clearing onthe lines accepted &quot;by the Cabinet at their previous meeting.The Cabinet agreed -To take note of this communication and to instruct the Acting Secretaryto the Cabinet to keep this subject -on the Agenda.
35  I9.    With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin,  the Cabinet briefly discussed theprocedure in regard to the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee under the Chairmanship ofSir H.J. Wilson on the Reports of the Investigatorsin the Depressed Areas.      In the course of discussionemphasis vras laid on the desirability of reachingconclusions on the various recommendations of theInvestigators with the least possible delay.The question was also raised whether tneReports of the Investigators should be published and,  if so,  in what form.The Cabinet agreed -(l) That a Cabinet Committee composed as followsThe Chancellor of the exchequer in the Chair,The Secretary of State for scotland or representative,The Minister of Health,The President of the Board of trade or representative,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesor representative,The Minister of Labour,The First Commissioner of Works,withThe Chief Industrial Adviser to HisMajesty&apos;s Government,should examine the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee (Paper CP.  220 (34))on the Reports of the Investigators intothe Depressed Areas  (Paper CP.  217 (34)),and should report to the Cabinet as soon aspracticable on the various recommendationsof the Investigators and also on the questionwhether the Reports of the Investigatorsshould be published, and, if so, in what form.(2) That a preliminary meeting of the Committeeshould be held in the Board Room, TreasuryChambers,  on Thursday, October 11th, 1934,at 3.0 p.m., it being understood that anymembers of the Committee unable to attendthis meeting might be represented by their parliamentary Under-Secretaries.
ICULTWRE.Livestockustry.Presentition.viouserence:met 31 (34)elusion 5).10.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(CP. 222 (34)) containing a short review of thepresent position of the Livestock Industry followingtne operation for over a month of the Emergency Schemefor the assistance of the industry, incorporated in the Cattle Industry (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1934.In the course of discussion some surprisewas expressed at the conclusion reached in theMemorandum that the outlook generally was not unsatisfactory having regard to the facts statedin the Memorandum and to the apparent failure to attain the main object for which the temporarybeef subsidy was given, namely, to raise the price which the producer obtained for his beef to a fairlevel.      The question was asked whether it was thoughtpracticable to raise the price to 42/- per hundrefl-weight by measures such as further restriction efimport or regulation of home production.      In thisconnection it was somewhat disquieting to observe that the price of beef in September was about 3/-lower than the price when the subsidy was firststarted.In reply the Cabinet were reminded that    inthe Memorandum the view was expressed that the outlookgenerally is not unsatisfactory provided overseassupplies are reasonably regulated.       Emphasis was laid on these latter words and the reasons for thelow prices haw ruling were explained.      It should be observed that present prices were not lower thanthe comparable prices last year, and that the producerthereforewas^getting the whole benefit of the subsidy.      Fromthis point of view the position was not/unsatisfactory.The question of a minimum price had been consideredby the Cabinet in the summer and rejected.      A risein beef prices could not be expected when the suppliessom the market were/much heavier than last year.-11-
The negotiations with the Dominions had had to hesuspended during the period or the Australiangeneral election hut were now ahout to be reopened.Everything depended on our being able tonegotiate successfully a long-term programmeof imports of beef from overseas.Reference was made to the strong and growingfeeling among home producers on the subjectof imports from the Dominions, and the view was expressed that no useful purpose would be served in negotiating with the Dominions until we were able to inform them of our agricultural policy as a v/hole and the concessions which we requiredin their markets in favour of our industries.It was pointed out that while the permanent scheme of restriction of imports would not comeinto operation until the 1st April,  1935, but itpossibleand desirable in the interests of all concerned that a start should be made in the restrictivearrangements as from the 1st January, 1935.The Cabinet took note that the wholequestion would be considered by the produce Markets Committee at a meeting to be held on Wednesday, 17th October,at 3,0 p.m.
NEXT MEETING 11.      The Cabinet agreed -OP THE .        .    .&apos; .CABINET, ^D bold their next meeting ajfeNo, 10, Downing Street on Wednesday.17th October,  1934, at 11.0 a.m.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,,10th October, 1934.-13-
