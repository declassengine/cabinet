MINISTERS OF 1.    The attention of the Cabinet was drawnTHE CROWfi HOLDING SHARES to the following question to be asked in the* IN armament firms. House of Commons that afternoon:&quot;Mr.  Cocks, - To ask the Prime Minister,whether there is any rule forbiddingMinisters of the Crown holding shares in armament firms;    and, if not,whether he will consider issuing sucha rule.&quot;After a brief discussion, the cabinet agreed that the answer to this question should beto the following effect:The answer to both parts of the Questionis in the negative:    the rule againstholding any directorships is quite adifferent matter, for it is impossibleto draw the line between armament and non-armament firms or between firmsincidentally concerned in producing someelement which might be used for war, andothers.      The effective safeguard lies in the traditional standards of public life in this country.Note:        The exact wording of this answer was subsequently settled by the Prime minister in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.
THE SAAR. 2.      The Cabinet were informed by the SecretaryIl of State for Foreign Affairs that the very*&apos; (previous reference: regrettable incident in the Saar in which a british cabinet 46  (34)Conclusion l).        member, Mr,  Justice, of the Saar Police Force,p^ was concerned, had been much exaggerated in theJ?(3d)2r      ,   British press,  that the local Saar papers hadtreated the matter calmly, and that there was noreason to suppose that very strong feelings hadbeen aroused as a result of it.      The GoverningCommission of the Saar had accepted the resignation of Major Hemsley,  the Chief Commissioner of the saar       Police Force,  and whatever the resultof the inquiry into the incident, it was not proposed to reinstate Mr.  Justice in the Force.Mr. Knox strongly deprecated any suggestionthat the Saar Police Force should be disbanded.The maintenance of the Force was, in his opinion,necessary, and the personnel were carrying out their duties satisfactorily.The Cabinet took note of this communication.,
REDUCTION AND 3.      No discussion took place on the subjectLIMITATION OEARMAMENTS, of the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments,but the Acting Secretary to the Cabinet was(previous reference: instructed to keep it on the Agenda Paper.Cabinet 45 (34)Conclusion 3).ft/?.
4.   With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet had before them a further report by the Committee on German Re-armament (C.P.-303 (34)), circulated by direction of the PrimeMinister, suggesting methods of approach and procedure as a general guide in the impending discussions with france, and, perhaps, later, with Germany, the main object of which would be the return of Germany to theLeague of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, andsome limitation of Germany&apos;s armaments.The Cabinet were informed that CP,-303 (-34)had been circulated for their information and thatthere was no question of the Cabinet being committed,at the present stage to anything contained in that paper.Generally speaking, the main purport of theReport was that we should not let the grass growunder our feet but should seize the present opportunity-nity to promote the return of Germany to Geneva.As would be seen from recent telegrams, it seemed likely that Prance might adopt an obstructive attitude.At any rate, the French Government showed no anxiety to expedite matters .   Their line was rather to marktime and to see how the situation developed in the saar and whether Germany could be brought into theproposed Eastern Pact.The Cabinet were reminded, that on the lastoccasion when the subject was discussed, it had been contemplated that M. Flandin, accompanied, possibly byMi Laval, would come to London before Christmas for full consultation, on the question.    It now appeared that M. Flandin was not coming to London, and that theFrench Government seemed disposed, to adopt precisely the opposite view to ourselves with regard to theneed, for an immediate decision on the main issue,
In these circumstances the question vas asked as towhat line should now be taken.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that- he was proposing to go tothe South of France at the end of the week, that hewould break the journey in Paris and would meet M.Flandin and M. Laval probably on Saturday.   At thismeeting he proposed to confine himself to making itperfectly clear to the French Ministers that we couldnot. agree to a policy of drift and that we must insist on a full discussion with France of the whole subject with the least possible delay.   At the same time hehad no intention whatever of entering into discussionof the subjects dealt with in C.P.-302 (34)at thismeeting on Saturday next.   As he had already stated,in telegram No, 141 to Sir George Clerk, his &quot;call at paris would not, of course, be a substitute for theofficial visit here, which ought to take place as soonas conditions are favourable,&quot;In the course of discussion, fear was expressed that as a result of the French attitude nothing could,or would be done until after the holding of the. Saarplebiscite, and that we ought- therefore to put the-strongest possible pressure upon France to abandonher present dilatory tactics.   Various ways in which such pressure might be exerted were indicated, and thesuggestion was also made that M. Flandin might perhaps be induced to come to London if he could be persuadedthat his visit might frighten Germany into more moderate courses and into moderating her demands.It might also be impressed, upon him that.further delaywas -all to Germany&apos;s advantage.Attention was drawn to rumours.that Francecontemplated as a possible alternative foreign policyan alliance with Russia.   Her present attitude was
ominous.      In this connection the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet that inhis view French policy at present preferred to seeGermany re-arming with the Treaty of Versaillesintact.      This was because she thought that,induced by fear, Russia would side with her againstGermany, and that in the long run we should alsobe found on her side.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) To take note that CP.  302 (34) was circulated for information only.(b) To approve the proposal of theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs that he should confer with M, Flandinand M. Laval in Paris on Saturday,December 22nd, and that at thismeeting he should make it clear to theFrench Ministers -(i) That the present conversationwas in no way a substitute forthe proposed official visit ofthe French Ministers to london for the purpose of negotiationswith His Majesty&apos;s Government:(ii) That His Majestyls government took a very grave view of thepresent situation in regard to german re-armament.      this situation was one which,  in theiropinion, demanded the most urgent and earnest attention of thetwo Governments.      The BritishGovernment had, therefore,invited French Ministers to visit London before Christmas,and it was earnestly hoped thatthey would see their way toconfer with us in London at theearliest convenient time inthe New Year:
fRMA-N RE-get m? ofjblnet.5, Arising out of the discussion recorded in *h.epreceding Conclusion, the Cabinet considered, thearrangements which would have to be made in the eventof the official visit of the French Ministers takingplace on or about January 7th.After a brief discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That in the event of the french ministers visiting Fngland aboutJanuary 7th, a Special Meeting ofthe Cabinet should be summoned totake place on either Thursday, January3rd,  or Friday, January 4th:(!) That the date of this Meeting wouldbe fixed as soon as the decision ofthe French Ministers was known, and.that as long notice as possible wouldbe given to members of the Cabinet:(c) ^hat there would, be circulated to theCabinet,for consideration at the meeting referred to above, a further Report ofthe Cabinet Committee on German Re-armament, embodying in definite formthe recommendations of.the Committee(d) That  if the french ministers  do   not         come to Londonearly in January, the next regularMeeting of the Cabinet should be heldon Wednesday, January 16,  1935.
IHB naval conference.1955.?previous reference:Cabinet 46 (54)Conclusion 4).f-A.6.  The Cabinet were informed, that the conversa-tions between the British, Japanese and AmericanDelegations had reached a definite stage and forthe first time the three Delegations were to meet together that afternoon for the purpose ofauthorising the publication of a communique&apos; and making arrangements for the adjournment.The communique&apos; to be issued was an agreed document and was more informatory than usual.It would indicate that there had been some approach to agreement and it did not shut the door to the holding of further meetings next year.With regard to the adjournment, the japanese were anxious that a date should be fixed for the resumption of the discussions, but to this the americans would not agree.In a few days&apos;  time Japan&apos;s denunciation of the Washington Treaty would be published, andit was very desirable that this event should betreated   by the Bress in its true perspective.With this end in view the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs proposed to explain the positionto representatives of our Bress after the meeting that afternoon.With regard to substance, our discussions with the Japanese had progressedfavourably and, so far as Japan was concerned,there was a good prospect of programmes being agreedwhich would cover the next six years and whichwould not alter the existing ratio.       difficulties over the programmes seemed more likely to comefrom the Americans than from the Japanese.The Cabinet were also informed by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs that he had had a very satisfactory interview on the subject-8-
with representatives of the Dominions and that nodifficulty with the Dominions need he apprehended.In reply to a question, the Prime minister stated that after the adjournment of the conversationsit would rest with His Majesty&apos;s Government to recallthe Delegations to London for a resumption of thediscussions.        If, as had &quot;been suggested, Vice-Admiral Yamamoto returned to Japan to confer with hisGovernment, he would not &quot;be in a position to resume the conversations in London until two or threemonths had elapsed.The Cabinet took note of these communications.(NOTE:    For the text of 0 emtnunlqueissued on December 30thsee Appendix.)

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that draft Terms of Reference were being carefully examined and would be submitted, to the Cabinet for approval indue course.   He also indicated to the Cabinet suggestions which had been made regarding the Chairman and othermembers of the - proposed Royal Commission.In the course of discussion suggestions regardingthe personnel of the Royal Commission were made, and.at the request of the Prime Minister the President ofthe Board of Trade undertook to submit to him forconsideration the names of one or two prominentleaders  of Industry whose special knowledge and expert-ence would, fit them for membership of the RoyalC commission.The Cabinet took note that the PrimeMinister hoped to be In a position tosubmit concrete suggestions regardingthe Terms of Reference, Chairman, and composition of the Royal Commission fortheir consideration earl;/ in the NewYear.
THE KTNCSACCESSION:TWENTY-PI FT HANNIVERSARYThe silver jubilee.second report of cabinet committee.(previous reference:Cabinet 33(34), Con-conclusion 8,?(35)79.     The Cabinet had before them the Second Reportof the Cabinet Committee on the Twenty-fifth anniversary of the King&apos;s Accession (C.P.-297 (34)), covering a revised Sketch Programme for the Celebrations in London,.the KingVs Visit &apos;to Edinburgh, and the Reviews, whichmodified certain items of the original programme andaltered dates in the light of information now available as to His Majesty&apos;s wishes.   The Committee submitted the revised Sketch Programme for Cabinet approval, onthe understanding that modifications might prove to benecessary as a result.lt of further consideration by HisMajesty.

The attention of the Cabinet was drawn tocertain objections to the proposal in (4) above,and it was agreed to invite the Cabinet Committee to reconsider this matter in the light of the cabinet discussions.The Cabinet took note that a further Reporton the question of the payment of wages on bank holiday (the 6th May) will be submitted to them indue course.The Cabinet considered certain items in the revised sketch programme (Appendix I to C.P0  297 (34))in the light of explanations given to them by theHome Secretary and other members of the CabinetCommittee and agreed that subject in each case toHis Majesty&apos;s approval:-(a) It was desirable that the Addressesfrom both Houses of Parliament shouldbe presented in Westminster Hall as contemplated in Paragraph 10 of CP.297  (34).(b) That it was desirable to dispense with allAddresses from Privileged Bodies (otherthan the Corporations of the Cities ofLondon and Edinburgh).(c) That it was desirable that, if possible,there should be the presentation at theGuildhall of an Address from the City ofLondon and the presentation by theCorporation of Edinburgh of an addressin the Hall of Parliament House, Edinburgh.(d) That it is desirable that the fourprocessional drives in London should beundertaken on the understanding that thetotal time occupied on each occasionwould not exceed an hour and a half andthat morning dress would be worn.(e) That it was desirable that a further state-ment in regard to the celebrations shouldbe published as soon as practicable.The Cabinet also agreed that the announcement that public buildings would be floodlit   &apos;during the celebrations should be made atthe same time as the further announcement in general terms of the arrangementsfor the celebrations.
.The Cabinet took note that at anAudience with His Majesty the Kingthat evening the Prime minister would convey to His Majesty theviews of the Cabinet on C.P.-397 (34&apos;.)generally on the revised SketchProgramme o** the Celebrations, and,in particular, on the points mentioneabove.
10. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade f CP,-298 (34)),entitled &quot;United Kingdom Trade with Morocco:    anArrangement for meeting Japanese Competition&quot;.   TheMemorandum stated that owing to the rapidly increasingcompetition of Japanese cotton goods in Morocco, theLancashire and French cotton industries had consultedtogether about a year ago on the possibility of theirjoint interests being safeguarded.   The French had recently submitted concrete proposals, which had been thoroughly discussed, and a detailed scheme had nowalmost been worked out, subject to the approval ofthe United Kingdom and French Governments .   The Memo-randum then set out the broad lines of the scheme,and the President of the Board of Trade expressed theopinion that the advantages of the scheme so muchoutweighed any possible disadvantages that he had no hesitation in asking the Cabinet to authorise himto conclude an arrangement in accordance therewith,subject to the details being worked out satisfactorilyThe Cabinet approved the proposalsof the President of the Board ofTrade as set out in CP.-298 (34).
MALTA.previous reference:Cabinet 39(34), Con-elusion 13.,)11-.   The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that Mr Mizzi had brought his action in the Malta Courts to obtain a declarationof invalidity of Ordinances passed, by the present government, on the ground that the state of grave emergency on which the suspension of the constitution is based is non-existent, and that the case had been adjourned ^or Judgment until January 9th.     LordStrickland had gone to Malta and was bringing asimilar action.    The Secretary of State had throughoutbeen advised, by the Law Officers, and it was to be hoped that the Maltese Courts would find that so longas the Secretary of State was satisfied that a grave emergency continued to exist, the present form ofGovernment could not be called in question.Judgment in the Court of first instance might beexpected in January, and if the case was taken to theCourt of -Appeal  in Malta that Court might give Judgmentby the end of February.    If the Maltese Courts took the view that the Secretary of State was wrong, itwould be necessary to legislate immediately here to legalise the position.The question was raised whether it would not bebetter to in.treduce 1 egIs 1 ation at. Westminsterwithout waiting for the decision of the Courts in malta.    It was pointed out, however, that this question had already been considered, by the Cabinet, which had.decided, against the suggestion,    tvi^jjq vj&amp;s no reasonto suppose that the action ccarter 1sted by the secretaryof State would cause any serious trouble either in malta or at home.    Sooner or later ii would be neces-aary to introduce legislation at Westminster to terminate the present Malta Constitution and toauthorise the carrying on of government by Orders inC council il.
MALTA. 11.

General agreement was expressed with, the viewthat, in the event of the Court of first instance in Malta finding against the Secretary of State, itwould   be better then to announce that we proposed at once to legislate rather than to await the resultof an appeal to the Court of Appeal in Malta.The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet that he would   defer asking for authorityto make any announcement until a future Meeting ofthe Cabinet.The Cabinet took note of the Constitu-tional situation in Malta as explained by the Secretary of State for theColonies.
12. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (C.P.-296 (34)) recalling that,intheir recent Reports on Depressed. Areas, Mr Euan Wallace. had. suggested an investigation into the amalgamation of Tyneside Authorities, and. Sir Wyndham Portal an investigation into the present status of Merthyr Tydfilas a County Borough.   The Chancellor of the exchequer had announced in the House of Commons that the G-overnmerthad decided that Inquiries should be made in both casesby competent bodies *   &quot;Tie Memorandum stated that inthe case of Tyneside it was desirable that the investi-gation should, be held by a body with power to call forevidence,  if need be, not merely able to invite evidence.For that reason the Minister of Health   proposed thatthe investigation should be held by a Royal Commissionof three persons, consisting of an independent Chairman,preferably a former holder of high judicial office, amember with experience of county government, and a. thirdmember with experience of urban government..   In thecase of Merthyr Tydfil the Minister proposed that the inquiry should be held by two persons of suitable status and. experience, and. sought Cabinet authority for his proposals .After a brief discussion the Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposals of theMinister of Health that, in the caseof Tyneside, the investigation should,be undertaken by a Royal Commission,and that in the case of Merthyr Tydfilthe Inquiry should, be held by two suit-able persons to be appointed, by theMinis ter.
E HERRINGINDUSTRY PILLi(previous reference:Cabinet 43(34), C on-clusion 14.)13.  mhe Cabinet had under consideration the followIng Joint Memoranda by the Secretary of State forScotland, the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Fome S secret et ary: -H ,A ,&quot;55 (34), covering the draft HerringIndustry Bill, which was designed toestablish a Herring Board, nominated, bythe Government   with, wide powers of controland regulation of the industry:    togetherwith the following Conclusions of theCommittee of Home &quot;Affairs thereon (H..A.C,82nd Conclusions (34), Minute 1) :-(a) To submit the Herring Industry Billin the form of the draft annexed with.A.-55 (34)  to the Cabinet forapproval, subject to the Considera-tion of the various points which hadbeen raised during the Committee&apos;discussion, and to any drafting orother minor alterations that mightbe found necessary or desirable:(b) tq leave to the Cabinet the decision whether the Bill should be introduced in its present form or in a shorterform which the Ministers responsiblewould submit as an alternative to theCabinet:(c) Subject to the decision of the cabinet as to which form of the Bill shouldbe adopted, to recommend the Intro-duction of the Herring Industry Billforthwith .in the House of Commons:C.P.-301 (34), submitting,  in accordancewith (b) above, a shorter form of the herring Industry Bill for considerationby the Cabinet as an alternative to the longer Bill (.H.A.-55 (34) j.The Secretary of State for Scotland explained to the Cabinet the advantages and disadvantages ofrespectively,the two Bills / and indicated that the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury preferred the Bill inits    short form.The Cabinet were informed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer that he had been consulted bythe Ministers concerned and as between the long and short forms of the Bill he had preferred the shorter
form as he had understood it.     He now found, however,that it was proposed to embody in the White Paper to hepublished simultaneously with the Bill the substance ofwhat it was proposed to delete from the long form of theBill.      Nothing would be gained by this procedure.Moreover, the substance of the provisions in question was-   in his view open to the gravest political andother objections.       His idea had been that parliament should set up the Herring Board which should be authorisedto prepare and submit to Ministers for approval thescheme containing the powers which the Board thought they ought to have.      In due course the Board&apos;s scheme wouldhave to be submitted to Parliament for approval by an affirmative Resolution of both Houses, but before thiswas done the Ministers concerned should take steps to consult the various sections of the industry affected andshould ascertain that the measures contained in thescheme met with at least majority approval.      This was entirely different from the arrangement contemplated inthe Bill under which the very drastic powers of the Boardoriginate not with the industry itself but with theGovernment.In the course of considerable discussion,  it was admitted that the powers proposed to be given to theBoard were very drastic:    they v/ere, however, less drasticthan the Duncan Committee after a full review of theindustry and its deplorable condition had recommended.The industry had asxed for legislation on the lines proposed and the proposal of the Chancellor of theExchequer was open to the objection that it would involve serious delay and prevent the coming into force of any scheme in time for the herring fishing season of 1935.On the other hand, emphasis was laid on thevery grave political and other objections to which themachinery of both Bills, as at present drafted, was.open.&apos;
If, as the Bills proposed,  the powers of the HerringBoard were conferred at the instance of the Government,the whole responsibility for most unpopular proposals would rest with the Government and the case would constitute a most dangerous precedent.      It was indeeddoubtful whether either Bill could be got through parliament.      On the other hand, if the powers of theBoard were conferred as a result of the Board&apos;s -initiative and were accepted by the industry as a wholebefore being finally approved,  the Government wouldhave no direct responsibility and no embarrassingprecedent would be created.It was also urged that if the industry had infact accepted the scheme it was because no alternativehad been placed before it, and that in its desperatecondition the offer of financial assistance had beenthe determining factor rather than the merits of thescheme itself.Doubts were expressed as to the principle ofthe scheme and it was urged that its operation shouldbe limited in the first instance to a period of twelvemonths.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed(a) That the Bill should be redrafted so asto set up the Herring Board and empowerthat Board to prepare and submit to theMinisters concerned for approval a schemecontaining the powers which the Board thinx.they should possess.      Before the scheme is laid before Parliament for final approvalthe industry should be consulted so as toascertain that the various sections are inagreement with the measures contained in thescheme.(b) To invite the Ministers concerned to confer with the Prime Minister, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor v/ar in regard to the revised dr.aft ofthe Bill, and on the question whether theoperation., of the Bill could not be limited in the first instance to a period of twelvemonths.(c) To taxe note that the Bill in its revisedform would be submitted to the Cabinet for&apos;approval before introduction.

APPENDIX.9 COMMUNIQUE.A meeting took place at the House of Commons this afternoon, under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister,to discuss matters connected with the adjournment of thePreliminary Naval Conversations.        The following were present at the meeting:-United States.Mr, Norman Davis*Admiral Standley,Mr. Ray Atherton,Mr. Dooman,Commander Schuirmann,Lt.-Commander Duncan.,Mr. Field,Mr, Reher.Japan.Mr. Matsudaira,Vice-Admiral Yamamoto,Mr.  S. Kato,Captain Iwashita,Mr. Mizota,United Kingdom.The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The First Lord of the Admiralty,Admiral Sir Ernie Chatfield,Sir Warren Fisher,Vice-Admiral Little,Mr, Craigie.At the end of the meeting the following communique was issued:The naval conversations, which were started last June,and, after a recess, have teen proceeding since October 23rd,are agreed by the representatives of all three Governments tohave served a useful purpose.      These conversations, whichwere initiated under the London Naval Treaty of 1930, becamebroadened in scope in the light of proposals and suggestionssubsequently made.      Every aspect of the naval problem has
27$EMDbeen discussed between the parties frankly, fully and amicably.It was never the purpose of these preliminary conversations toreach any hard and fast conclusion:    the sole purpose was toprepare the ground for future negotiation and agreement.      TheFrench and Italian Governments? who were also signatories ofthe present naval treaties and were associated with thediscussions in the summer, have been kept informed of alldevelopments.Although the three Governments represented in these conversations are in favour of a continuation of naval limita-tion with such reduction as can be agreed upon by all thePowers concerned,  the principle and methods for achieving this in the future remain to be determined.      Now that the respectiveviews have been made known and fully discussed,  the conversa-tions have reached a stage when it is felt that there shouldbe an adjournment in order that the delegates may resumepersonal contact with their Governments and the resultingsituation can be fully analysed and further considered.      Ithas therefore been agreed to adjourn the conversations at thispoint.The Governments concerned in the London conversations will,keep in close touch with each other and with the other Govern-ments which are parties to the London and Washington NavalTreaties.      The adjournment will also give His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom an opportunity for further consulta-tion with the Governments of the Dominions.    It is hoped that,in view of the preparatory work accomplished during the conversations which have already taken place, the situation will so develop as to justify a subsequent meeting as soonas the opportune moment arrives.      In that event the Governmentof the United Kingdom which initiated the present conversations,will take the appropriate steps,19th December, 1934.
