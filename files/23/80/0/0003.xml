AgeasSINALIGNS OP 1. The Cabinet briefly considered the questiont     ALEX AND E Ri\ND M. BARTHOU. whether,  on the re-assembling of Parliament, any-y Parliamentary action such as a Resolution of Condo-Pp-rJo-^rioUSReference: lence should be moved in respect of the assassina-Oabinet 34(34), Con- tions at Marseilles of Ping Alexander and M.Ba,rthou.elusion 3.)General agreement was expressed with the view that,having regard, to the action already taken by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in conveyingthe condolences of His Ma,iesty&apos;s Government to theFrench and. Yugo-Slavian authorities, it was unnee.es-sary to invite Parliament to pass any Resolution,and. also undesirable to do so, inter alia because this would involve interrupting business at there opening o^1 the Session, the time of which was already more than fully occupied.The Cabinet agreed  ^o leave the matter to be settled bythe Prime Minister in consultationwith the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, after the latter had examinedany relevant precedents.
THE memorial service TOTHE LATE KINGALEXANDER.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(34), Con-elusion 3.)2, With reference to the Conclusion mentioned the margin, the Cabinet agreed  That the following Ministers should attend the Memorial Service to thelate King Alexander, to be held inthe Russian Orthodox Church,Buckingham Palace Road, at Noon onThursday, October IS, 1934:-The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,The Secretary of State for War,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Postmaster-General.(NOTE.:    The Cabinet were informed thatLevee Dress would be worn at theMem o r ia1 S erv ice.)
3. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the adverse comment in foreign countries on the exhibitionin numerous cinemas in the United Kingdom of the-news reel of the actual assassinations of KingAlexander and. M, Barthou, and. the view was expressed that public exhibition of films of this charactershould not be allowed.    It was pointed, out, however,that the censorship of films did not extend, tonews reels .    there were two forms of censorship,both applying to ordinary films:    the Board ofCensors, which was a piece of trade machinery, andthe censorship of the Local Authorities, arisingfrom a practice of making the grant of the licenceof a building for cinematograph displays conditional on the Local Authority being empowered to prohibitparticular films.The Cabinet were reminded that when the Films bill was before Parliament the question of establishing a censorship had been considered and rejected.    Itwas also pointed out that the cinema industry&apos; wouldcontend, that they should not be penalised for display-ing news reels of this character so long as no objec-tion was taken to newspaper descriptions of thetragedy, however horrible and sensational.The Cabinet were informed that, on the re-assemblingof Parliament,  questions would certainly be asked inthe House of Commons and that it would be necessaryto reassure the Bouse on the subject.The Cabinet agreed.  To invite the Home Secretary to confer onthe matter with representatives of theCinema Industry, Local Authorities andothers concerned, with a view, if possible,to an announcement being made in Parliamentto the effect that assurances had beenreceived from the interests concernedwhich would, ensxire against the repetition of the display of a news reel of thecharacter in question.   The Home secretary was requested to report to the Cabinet attheir next Meeting on the result of these conferences.
cabinet procedure.Access toCabinetPapers bynon-OfficialPersons .(previous reference:Cabinet 11(34). Con-clusion 5.)4. With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat in the mhird Volume of Mr Lloyd George&apos;s !?ra,rMemoirs, which had-just been published, Mr LloydGeorge had quoted extensively from two Memorandawritten by Lord Milner for the War Cabinet in 1917just before the outbreak of the Russian Revolution,and that he had also criticised Lord Milner for not having foreseen and warned, the Government that theRevolution was imminent.   The proofs of the Volumein question had been examined by the Secretary tothe Cabinet and the Departments concerned, and thesanction of the Lord President of the Council forthe publication of the extracts had been obtained.Lady Milner had now written to ask whether she might be allowed, to see the documents in question,in order that if she thought fit she might reply toMr Lloyd. George&apos;s observations in a further Volumeof Lord Milner&apos;s Life, now in course of preparation.As Lord Milner&apos;s Cabinet Papers had all been returnedto the Cabinet Office, Lady Milner could only get-access to these particular documents by approaching the Cabinet Office, and the- consent of both thePrime Minister and Mr Lloyd George would, have to beobtained before Lady Milner could be shown the documents,The Foreign Office had been consulted, and had.stated, that there was no objection to Lady Milnerseeing the two documents as any use she might makeof them would not impair our relations with the SovietGovernment nor cast any damaging light on our actionsin the past.It was pointed out that if consent was given inthe present case it would constitute a precedent in future similar cases, and these eases were likelyA.-.
to &quot;become much more numerous in view of the cabinet decision referred to in the mar sin, to the effectthat all Cabinet Papers were to be returned onvacation of office.In the course of discussion the view was expressed that very great care should be exercised in authorising the publication in the first instance by ex-Ministers of Cabinet documents, having regardto the possible reactions of such publicationresulting, as in the present case, in the claim ofnon-Official persons to inspect the documents.It was suggested that a distinction should be drawn between cases where a historian, or biographer wishedto see Secret Papers in order that he might produce a better bock, and cases, like the present, wherea person with, a good title to vindicate the memoryof a deceased Statesman desired to see the papers in order that he might defend the memory of the deceased, against criticism made by some other person who had published extracts from the documentswith authority.    In the former class of oasesaccess should, as a rule, be refused, as thehistorian or biographer should not be placed inany better position than an ordinary member cp thepublic, and should therefore only get access todocuments if and when they became available atthe Record Office,    In the latter class of cases,however, it would be very difficult to refuse access to an aggrieved person of a document the publicationof which by another person had been duly author-is ed.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  
That while each case must be decided on its merits as it arises, the general line should be as follows&apos;.-(l) Access by non-Official persons to Cabinet and other similarfm lU %cdx CmltFcLi c/j I_Seeret doouments^should not ben4u&apos;cU itt  oi/lUtt      t        given where the object of the&apos;Wi CUC dhk^iKt   )        applicant is the production of an&apos; -     ordinary historical, biographical orother similar work:(S)  In cases, however, where extracts from Cabinet or other similarSecret documents have already been published with authority, access to the documents may, subject tothe conditions named in (S) below,be given to any person who has agood title to vindicate the memoryof a deceased person and who claims that that memory has been injuredby the publication in question:.^(3) The conditions to be satisfied&quot;under(s) above are -(a) That the documents must contain   -nothing the publication of whichwould be prejudicial to thepublic interest:(b) That in each case the proofs of anything proposed to be published by the vindicator should be sub-mi tied to the Cabinet Office forapproval before publication:(c) That the specific sanction ofthe Prime Minister of the day,as well as of the Prime minister in office when the Secret documentswere actually produced and circulated,must be obtained before accessis given: b^ a non-Official person(4) That Lady Milner&apos;s application shouldbe acceded to. provided the conditionsnamed in (3)  fa)  (b) and (c) above are satisfied.(NOTE:   The Prime Minister invited members ofthe Cabinet to scrutinise the wording-   - of the above Conclusion and to informthe Acting Secretary to the cabinet of any alterations they might wish tot suggest .)
5.    With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed the Cabinet that recent events had increased his anxiety in regard to the situationin Memel.It would be remembered that when Poland seized3Vilna in 192% (Vilna having been awarded toLithuania by an inter-allied commission) theLithuanians retaliated by seizing Memel.      Memelhad been detached from Germany by the Treaty ofVersailles and was for the time being being administered by a French High Commissioner on behalfof the League,      Thereupon the Meaael convention was drawn up and signed by ourselves,. France, Italyand Japan on the one side and Lithuania on theother, according to which Memel was given a specialConstitution with a Diet or Legislature, and an executive or Directory and a Governor who washimself nominated by Lithuania.      The Constitutionof Memel was an elaborate document called theMemel Statute.Germany had been complaining for some time that the Memel Statute was not being observed andthat the Governor of Memel was using his powersto deprive German speaking Memel-landers of their rights.      Herr von Hoesch had been to see theSecretary of State about this more than once andit is a constant topic between the German Embassyand the department concerned at the Foreign Office.The signatory Powers, France, Italy and our-selves, referred the question whether the MemelStatute was being violated, as alleged, to aCommittee of Jurists, including Sir William Malkin,the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office.      Thematerial before the Jurists included an elaborate-7-
memorandum setting out what was alleged to have happened which was supplied by Herr Meyer, formerlyVice-President of the Diet.The Jurists had just reported and they foundunanimously that there had been a series of &quot;breaches of the Memel Statute for which, of course, the lithuanian Government must be held responsible since it was their nominee, the Governor, who had intervenedto deny the Diet its rights, e.g. he had refused toallow them to move a vote of want of confidence inthe Directory and it was quite certain that theDirectory did not enjoy the confidence of the Diet.Again, the Governor prevented the Diet meeting bycontinually proroguing it, etc.The Germans, therefore, were now shown tohave been justified in their complaints and they expressed themselves very strongly and indicated that their patience is becoming exhausted.      Thiswas  the more serious because German troops in east prussia were within a very short distance of Memeland there was a risk that Germany would one day soontake the bit between her teeth and go to the rescueof German-speaking Memel-landers,  the latter, nodoubt, were largely Nazi.      The Lithuanian army wouldbe able to hold down Meinelland if left to itself,for the Memel-landers were disarmed, but a clash between Lithuania and Germany would be a very different affairs.      If once this happened therewas always the possibility that Soviet Russia might take part.      The Germans know that the Juristshave reported and, though they do not know the termsof the report, must icnow that it was adverse toLithuania.      They, therefore, are asking&apos; us, as oneof the signatories to the Memel Convention, what we are going to do.      If we did nothings this would furnish a strong additional reason for Germany to
interfere herself.      The Secretary of State had,       4&quot;therefore, addressed the French and Italian Governmentsurgently,  calling attention to the Jurists report and asking them to join us in making a demarch at Kovno.Neither France nor Italy had been very forthcoming;indeed, Italy had been distinctly cool, if notdouble-faced.      But we must urge a joint representation at Kovno,  calling attention to these serious breachesand require that they should be amended.      Joint&apos;representation was obviously best, though if theLithuanians remain obdurate it was difficult to s eewhat.pressure could be put on them.      The GermanEmbassy suggested that we should put commercialpressure on Lithuania, but has been told that this wasimpossible.In conclusion the Secretary of State asked the Cabinet to approve the action he had taken and,at the same time, warned the Cabinet that this was avery ugly situation which might conceivably provideGermany with the first concrete; opportunity ofenlarging her borders.      Meinel was the easiest pl^sseon the map for Germany to break down the territorialsettlement of Versailles.In reply to questions the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet that we hadno-obligations under^ he Memel Convention.      The reason the Germans had approached us was.no doubt becausethey thought that we should take a more detached and impartial view than the French or Italians.      TheLithuanians would not be likely to object to the question being referred to the Court of International Justiceat the Hague, but they would strenuously resist a reference to the Council of the League of Nations.The suggestion was made that it might be advantageous to get the matter referred to the Hague court and that it would be difficult for the Germans
to resort to some violent action while the ease was before that Court,    In this connection it was pointedout that if we alone moved the reference to theHague Court there was some risk that we should beasked at a later stage to implement the Court&apos;sfindings.   Prom this point of view it would, therefore,be -better if the reference to the Hague Court came from the Council of the League under Article XIV ofthe Covenant of the League of Nations, under whichthe Council is entitled to ask the Hague Court foran advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the Council.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the action taken by theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs in drawing the attention of France andItaly to the matter, and that he should report to the Cabinet what further steps, if any, should be taken.\-10-

The Prime Minister drew the attention ofthe Cabinet to the very secret Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, CP, 225 (34), onthe future of Anglo-Japanese relations, and statedthat he proposed to place this item on theAgenda for the next meeting of the Cabinet.
THE naval conference,1935.Anglo-JapaneseDiscussions.Report of cabinet committee,(previous reference:Cabinet 34 (34)Conclusion 5).538.    In pursuance of the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet had under consideration the Conclusions of a meeting of the Cabinet committee held at No.  10, Downing Street on the previous day,October 16th, at 4.0 p.m.      These Conclusions,copies of which were handed round at the meeting,read as follows:-In pursuance of Cabinet 34 (34), conclusion, a Cabinet Committee composed of:-The Prime Minister,The Lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, andThe First Lord of the Admiralty,met to consider the position in regard to theforthcoming preliminary discussions with theJapanese Delegation to the Naval Conference,to settle the United Kingdom representation,and to give instructions as to the line ?/hichour Representatives should t alee at thediscussions.After discussion, the Committee agreedthat the following recommendations should besubmitted to the Cabinet at the meeting to he held at 11.0 a.m.  on the following day,October 17th.UnitedKingdomRepre-sent a-tion.That the members of the above committee who would normallyrepresent the United Kingdom inthe forthcoming naval discussions should be ;-The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,The First Lord of the Admiralty,Other members of the Committeeshould attend meetings as andv^hen necessary.That the Cabinet Committee shouldcontinue in being and thatthe Committee should meet toconsider questions of policyafter the conclusion of the meetings referred to in 1 above.That at the first Anglo-JapaneseMeeting the United kingdom should be represented by:-The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,The First Lord of the Admiralty,and that the Meeting with theJapanese should precede any

INDIA.Work of the(-Indian Joint, Select Committeeand FutureI procedure.[(previous Reference:j Cabinet 34 (34)\ Conclusion 2).(Note:      The minute of discussion will constitute an Appendix to these Conclusions,)9.    On behalf of the members of the Cabinetthe Prime Minister warmly congratulated theSecretary of State for India on the skilfulmanner in which he had conducted the Governmentscase in the Joint Select Committee and on thevery successful outcome of his efforts as shown by the large majority by which the Report had beenadopted in the Joint Select Committee.The Secretary of State for India thanked thePrime Minister and then proceeded to summarisefor the benefit of the Cabinet the present positionin regard to the Report and the principal changes which had been made since the publication of theWhite Paper.The Cabinet took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for India and agreed that,  in view of the necessity for maintaining absolute secrecy for thepresent in regard to the findings of theJoint Select Committee, the Acting Secretaryto the Cabinet should not circulate the minute of the discussion with the presentCabinet Conclusions but should defersuch circulation until the Secretary ofState for India notified him that thestatement might be released for circulation.
PARLIAMENTARYTvryOTWPC! QOUoXiNiiJOia1934 - 35SESSION.9(ReferenceCabinet34 (34)Conclusion 1.)fill.10. With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Prime Minister informed theCabinet that he had discussed the question ofParliamentary Business in the 1934 - 35 Session ingreat detail with the Lord President of the Counciland the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury.Indeed, a provisional programme had been draftedcovering every day between the opening of the new session on Tuesday, 20th November, 1934, to the adjournment of the Summer Recess on Thursday, 1stAugust, on the assumption that it would be possibleto adjourn on that day.This provisional programme provided for thefollowing adjournments :-ChristmasEasterThursday, 20th December, toTuesday, 29th January, 1935,Thursday, 13th April, toTuesday, 30th April.Accession Day   Monday, 6th May,WhitsuntideThursday, 6th June, toTuesday, 18th June.During the period there would be 104 wholedays of Government time and 8 Fridays, or 108 wholedays in all.     Essential and routine business,including such items as the Debate on the Address,Business of Supply,     Budget and Finance Bill,Adjournments and contingencies, such as Votes of censure, Special Debates, etc., would take up in all64 days, leaving 44 whole sittings for the GovernmentLegislative Programme and all other business.Deducting 2 or 3 days for the Debate on the Motionto approve Unemployment Regulations, and 4 daysdebate on the India Report, this would leave 37 daysavailable up to the end of July for all legislation
including the India Bill for which the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury estimated that 48 days wouldhe required in all, and other Bills, such as theShipping Industry Bill, the Housing Bill, the national health Insurance Bill, and the Cattle Industry Bill.In these circumstances it was clearly imperativeto take the whole time of the House for government business and to deprive Private Members of their rightson the IS Wednesdays and 18 Fridays, and the PrimeMinister informed the Cabinet that he had decided toadopt this course.     By so doing the margin of 37 daysfor legislation became 57 days after allowing one day for the Motion to take Private Members&apos; time.If 48 days was given to the India Bill (33 in committee) , 3-g- to the Shipping Industry Bill, 3 to the cattle Industry Bill, 4-g- to the Housing Bill, and 6 tothe National Health Insurance Bill, the estimated timefor the chief Bills would be 64 days as against 57available days.     Clearly there was no provision here for minor Bills or emergency legislation.The Session would naturally fall into two parts divided by February 25th.     It was imperative that the Second Reading of Bills to be passed in the session should be taken before, that date, because Itwas quite out of the question to take Second Readingsof any important measures after that date.It was proposed to take the Second Readingsof the Housing and Shipping Bills before the end ofJanuary, and the Second Reading of the India Bill onthe 4th &quot;February.     It was clear that there would be many weeks when the India Bill must occupy 3 days inthe week in Committee of the whole House.According to the provisional programme the India bill would leave the House of Commons about July 18th.
In the course of considerable discussion the view was expressed that it was most important that the IndiaBill should, if possible, pass through the House of Lordsbefore the Summer adjournment in 1955.      If it was only possible to take the Second Reading of the Bill in theHouse of Lords before that adjournment the critics of theGovernment would be free in August and September to mobilise opposition to the Bill.   On the other hand, theCabinet were informed that it was out of the question to expect the House of Lords to pass by the end of July aBill which they only received from the House of commons on July 18th, and that an attempt to keep the House in session during August for the purpose of passing the Billinvolved grave risks of the loss of the Bill.     Even ifthe House of Lords received the Bill by the 1st Julyfrom the House of Commons, it was very doubtful whetherits passage through that House could be secured by 1stAugust.Various suggestions were made for meeting thedifficulty, such as that the time in Committee in theHouse of Commons should be very substantially reduced or that the Christmas holidays should be shortened.Another proposal was that the 3 days debate in committee before the Guillotine Resolution should be deleted.In this connection it was suggested that it might befound possible to obtain an agreed Guillotine Resolutionunder which substantially less than 30 days would be devoted to the Committee stage.     The Cabinet were informed, however, that the Lord President of theCouncil and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasuryfavoured the giving of generous time in Committee, andcited in this connection the provision made for theVmmJ&apos; *A jAdaW till CW&apos;A),3fe4sh^^ee^t-ato Bill.      It was urged, however, that
there was no precedent for the present Bill, whichmight comprise as many as 350 clauses.     Most of theprominent Members of the House of Commons had sat onthe Joint Select Committee for 13 months, and this wasin itself a justification for cutting down the time tobe devoted to the Bill.     It was out of the question toattempt to reduce the size of the Bill, as, apart fromother considerations, there were grave political objections to so doing.   It was also suggested that ifthe Report of the Joint Select Committee was well received in the country, it would then be much easier to compress the time table for the Bill.The Prime Minister undertook to confer further with the Lord President of the Council and theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury in the light ofthe discussion.-20-
parliamentary business.legislation for the1934-35Session.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(34), Con-conclusion 1.)11, The Prime Minister drew the attention ofthe Cabinet to the long list of Bills which hadbeen proposed for the 1934-35 Session, as set outin I? ,&amp; ,-46 (34), and stated that as the second partof the Session from February 85th (the date whenit is expected, the Committee Stage of the India bill will begin) to the Summer Recess was fully mortgagedwith essential and routine business and the IndiaBill, It was therefore during the first period(November 20th to&apos;February 22nd) that progress mustbe made with other Government measures.    It would,be necessary rigidly to insist on the restriction ofsuch measures to those absolutely essential, and he proposed, in consultation with the Lord Presidentof the Council and the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury, to examine the position from, thispoint &quot;of view and to report in due course to theCabinet,.

OPT OBEE IT.   19 54.(Cabinet 55 (54)  9.)*        9        *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA thought that theCabinet might like to hear about the present, position ofthe work of the Joint Select Committee on India,   ThisCommittee had been sitting for more than a year and a half, and no previous Parliamentary Committee in moderntimes had sat for so long or had had such a complicated and difficult task.   The work had not been made easierby the fact that the deliberations of the Committee had had to be suspended for three months to allow of consults-tions with delegations from India.The Joint Select Committee had itself held 159Meetings, and in addition there had been hundreds of meetings of Conferences and Sub-Committees.   The Committee&apos;sFieport had now been adopted by a majority of more than two to one of the members of the Committee, the minoritybeing composed of the extreme Right and the extreme Lefton the Committee.   The former consisted ofLord Salisbury and the four members who thought with him.The latter comprised the four representatives of thejb Labour Party on the Committee.   These four Labour repre-sentatives undoubtedly approved of much contained, in theReport, but they had voted against the Report underpressure from the more extreme elements in their Partyouts ide.
The Report, therefore, was opposed only by theextreme elements on the Committee, and it was very satisfactory and Gratifying to note that the independent members of the Committee -  including such powerful namesas Sir Austen Chamberlain, Lord Derby, Lord Zetland andLord. Reading-were genuinely convinced, that there was no practicable alternative to the Government&apos;s proposals.Moreover, Lord Fardinge, who at the outset had followedLord Salisbury, had reached the same conclusion as theresult of his participation in the deliberations of theCommittee, and had ended by voting in favour of the Report.Since the Report was adopted he (the Secretary of State) hadreceived letters from various independent members, includingLord Derby and Sir Austen Chamberlain, stating that theywere now in complete agreement with the findings of theReport and that the results of the prolonged discussions had been to convert the Centre Party on the Committee as,a whole to the Government&apos;s proposals.With regard to the Report itself, in form it would,be a unique document.    Previous Reports of Select-Committees had been of a. somewhat perfunctory nature and often limited to a statement of the conclusions reached by the Committee.   At an early stage the Joint SelectCommittee on India had decided that a Report on the linesof previous Reports would be quite unsuitable in the present-case, having regard to the importance and. magnitude of the issues involved.   The whole Committee agreed that theReport must constitute a great State Document worthy ofthe occasion and. the subject-matter.   The Report itself was very long.   This could not be helped.    It was preceded by a very able and. illuminating introduction, for which lord. Eustace Percy was in the main responsible..When the Report was published it- would be foundthat a number of not unimportant changes had been madesince the issue of the White Paper.   Re (the Secretary ofState) did not propose to burden the Cabinet with an-2-
exposition of all the changes that had. been made, but would, limit himself to describing a few of the moreimp or t ant mo d i fi c at i ons B(l) The system of election to the Federal Legislaturehad been changed by the substitution of indirectfor direct election.   Apart from the merits of theqx^estion there were very strong political arguments in favour of this alteration.   Under a system of direct election there would have, been singleconstituencies with electorates of the size ofthe United Kingdom.The members of the Federal Chambers would be elected by the Provincial Legislatures,    Tie Hindus,no. doubt disliked, this change from direct to indirectelection, but many of them had come to regard thechange as inevitable.The Committee was overwhelmingly in favour ofthe change, and at an early stage he (the Secretaryof State) had realised that- he could not get thesupport of the independent members of the Committeeunless this alteration was conceded.(2)       A second, change related to the quest-ion ofcommercial discrimination.    It must be realised,that it was impossible, by any practicable conces-sions, to conciliate extremist opinion in Lancashire:but moderate opinion in Lancashire, while preparedto accept full fiscal autonomy for India in future,was nervous that some future Indian Government mightuse its fiscal autonomy weapon as a lever to exactfurther, concessions in the political field,   Tiemajority of the Joint Select Committee had realised that some safegxiard must be provided, an-5 they had agreed that, the Governor-General should, be empowered,and, indeed.,, instructed, to intervene in cases where he was satisfied that fiscal autonomy was being u&amp;eS
for political and not for purely fiscal purposes,fie (the Secretary of State) considered that it was right and proper to reserve this particular power,and that its reservation would go far to satisfymoderate opinion in Lancashire without seriouslyInfringing the principle of Indian fiscal autonomy.A third important matter was concerned with thepensions of retired Officials.   The Joint SelectCommittee had been pressed, to recommend that thesepensions should be taken over by the Imperial G-overn-ment as an Imperial obligation.   The Committee hadnot seen their way to make any such recommendation,but in the case of &quot;family pensions&quot;, i.e., depend-ants* pensions, they were in favour of the earlytransfer of the fund from which these pensions were paid from India to the United Kingdom, so that infuture it should be administered here as a Trust FundThere were a number of other changes designed tosafeguard our security.   For example, Orders in .Council would require Affirmative Resolutions ofboth Houses.There remained the very difficult question of thePolice   perhaps the most difficult of the questionswith which the Committee had been confronted.   TheCommittee had felt that it was not possible to haveProvincial autonomy without the transfer of law andorder:    but if law and order were to be transferred,two important matters must be safeguarded:-(a) Steps must be taken to prevent anybreakdown in the moral of the police forces:    and(b) There must be no compromise ofsecret information or the sotircesfrom which such information wasderived..Eventually the Committee had practically unani-mously agreed on a plan under which, as regards the
internal discipline of the Police ^Police Rulescovering matters of discipline, conditions ofservice, etc.) there should be no alteration withoutthe sanction of the Provincial Governor or of the .Governor-General.    Under this plan it was certainthat the Police Force could not in future be jockeyedabout for political purposes, and Sir Charles Tegarthad informed the Secretary of State that this provi-sion would greatly reassure the Police throughoutTnd ia,With regard to secret information and its sources,this was, of course, a very    important matter in Bengal,and there was a very general feeling that the sources of information would dry up on the advent to powerof Indian Ministers .    The Committee had decided thatthe Provincial Governors must be given powers underwhich the secret sources  of information would besecure against being compromised.    In Bengal thiswould probably mean that Sir John Anderson would retain control in his own hands.The Committee had considered the question whether,in the general question of the transfer of law and.order, differentiation should   not be made in thecase of Bengal, but they had been very stronglyadvised against such a course,   To make an exceptionin the case of Bengal would unite the whole of Bengalagainst the plan, and the Mohammedans, who saw somechance of coming into power, would greatly resent any suggestion that they were not to be trusted withthe conduct of their own affairs.It was proposed, therefore,, to give to all the governors general powers against terrorism, underwhich all Governors everywhere could retain in their owihands the powers and. services which they thought neces-sary to deal with terrorism.    It was very much better to give the Governors general powers than specificpowers, and ouM4c opinion in India would be much more
likely to acquiesce in the grant of general powersthan of specific powers.The Cabinet would observe that the important changes to which he had referred had all been made in theinterests of British security, and it must be realised in this regard that British and Indian points of viewwere almost irreconcilable.   At the same time, from theIndian point of view it was very important to remember that, after months of investigation and discussion, theJoint Select Committee had pronounced in favour of thethree main principles to which the Indians attachedimportanc e, viz.:-Responsibility at the Centre:Provincial autonomy:    andThat the scheme should deal with both these matters at the same time.Sensible Indians must recognise that this represented, agreat achievement, and must be greatly relieved thatthese principles had been adopted.    It would be necessaryin the coming months to stress this point of view on every possible occasion with representative Indians, andto emphasise the importance to India of having gainedthese three principles intact,    Indian representativesmust also be warned that if, by opposition, they endangeredthe passage of the Pill, there was no probability oftheir ever being able to secure legislation on morefavourable terms .In reply to THE PRIME MINISTER, the Secretary ofState for India said that the Report of the Joint SelectCommittee would be published on November 81st or 82nd,after the Indian Elections had been held.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS enquire whether the Joint Select Committee had decided on theimportant question whether the Central or provincial legislatures should have any power to alter the newConstitution?
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA replied that,speaking generally, the Constitution wouldbe a rigid one.    It was not proposed to confer on theIndian Legislatures any const ituent powers:    but, onthe suggestion of a prominent Native of India, aprovision had been inserted under which the legislatureswould be enabled, from time to. time to make formalrepresentations to the Imperial Parliament on thesubject of amendments of the Constitution.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat this conclusion of the Joint Select Committeewould reassure many who were anxious in regard to thisparticular matter.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF EDUCATION said thatthe Secretary of State for India had paid, a tribute tothe beneficial influence exercised by moderate opinionon the Joint Select Committee.   He (Lord Halifax) hadbeen present throughout the Committee^ deliberations,and he wished to say that the results obtained were, inthe main, due to the indefatigable efforts and. to the wisdom shown :     throughout the proceedings by theSecretary o^ State for India.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA emphasised thegreat importance of maintaining absolute secrecy inregard, to the statement which he had just made, untilthe Report of the Joint Select Committee was published.Accordingly the Cabinet, after taking note of thestatement made by the Secretary of State for India,agreed  That, in view of the necessity for main-taining absolute secrecy for the presentin regard to the findings of the joint select Committee, the Acting Secretaryto the Cabinet should not circulate the minute of the discussion with the present-Cabinet Conclusions, but should, defer suchcirculation until the Secretary of Statefor India notified, him that the statementmight be released for circulation.
