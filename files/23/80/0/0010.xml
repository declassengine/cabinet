OFFMAN RE-ARMAMENT .^previous reference:Cabinet 41(34), Con-clusion 2.)2. The Cabinet held a Special Meeting to considerthe subject of German Re-armament, and had beforethem the following documents:-The Report of the Cabinet Committeeappointed at the Meeting mentionedin the margin (C.P.-265 (34)), con-taining the following summary of recommendations :-(a) That the evidence of German re-armament is now so formidablethat we feel it can no longer be officially ignored, and that,if the situation in Germany is allowed to develop without let orhindrance&apos; on present lines, theGerman forces may ultimately become a menace to the peace of Europe.(b) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should,therefore, announce in general butfriendly terms in the House ofCommons on Wednesday, November28th, 1934, that, from information in their possession, they are convinced, that Germany is accumu-latlng military forces far in excessof those permitted by the Treaty of&quot;Versailles, and are apparently aiming at fulfilling as rapidly as possiblethe programme which was put forward by them early this year (vide Cmd.,4559) .(c) That it is important, in making this statement, to ensure that the issue is kept on a European plane and isnot allowed to become purely an anglo-German consideration&apos;    and,further, that, so far as possible,no Par Eastern issues should beallowed to become involved.(d) That there would be a number of advan-tages in being able to inform theHouse of Commons that the german ambassador had. already been made aware of the public action whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government are pro-posing to take in regard to Germanre-armament;    and also that theFrench and Italian Governments should,be given preliminary information.(e) That, in order to implement conclusion(d) recorded above, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should, be requested, to arrange for an interview with the German Ambassador and also tomake suitable communications to theFrench and. Italian Ambassadors.( f) That particular importance is attached,to making as specific and comprehensive-sive a statement as possible on theGovernment&apos;?, air expansion programme,
particularly as to the greatest numberof squadrons that it may be possibleto form, in the circumstances, duringthe next two years:    and, for thispurpose, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Air have been asked to consultas to the nature of the programmethat can be so announced.A Note by the Acting Secretary to theCabinet (CP .-368 (34)) circulating, by direction of the Prime Minister, thefollowing documents in connection with theabove-mentioned Report:-The Cabinet were informed by the Prime minister that the conclusions contained in the Report of theCabinet Committee (CP,-265 (34)) had been reachedafter very full and. careful consideration of thewhole question at a number of meetings of the Committee,the last of which, held on the previous evening, hadbeen attended, by Fls Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin,who had been specially summoned to London for purposeof consultation.    Sir Eric Phipps was in complete agreement with the Committee *s recommendations.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to theline proposed to be taken in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons (see particularly conclusions(b), (c) and (f) above) and to the proposal, that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs should, either on that day or on the following day, make a communica-tion to the German Ambassador in London, and suitablecommunications to the French and Italian Ambassadors.It was of great importance that there should be not he Government proposed, to take in the Debate:    thatline must first be announced in the House of Commons.mhe cabinet were also informed of the reasons for theCI.D. Paper No. 1150-B.O.I.D. Paper No. 1151-B.C.I.D. Paper No. 1152-B.G.R.  (34) 2.premature disclosure in the Press of the line whichunanimous conclusion   of the Committee that the
Government Spokesmen in the Debate should not includeMinisters of the Service Departments.At the outset of the discussion attention was directed to the fact that the Committee had made norecommendations to the Cabinet as to otir future policyconcerning the legalisation of German re-armament, andthe view was expressed that the Government would be forced in the very near future, if not in the Debateitself, to declare their policy in the matter, andthat there was considerable risk in taking the lineproposed to the Cabinet unless the general lines ofthe policy to be pursued, in future had been thoughtout in advance.   The Cabinet were informed that this aspect of the matter had been carefully examined bythe Committee, which had reached the conclusion that       &apos;yit would be a mistake to attempt to define future policy until the situation had further developed.   Theproposed statement could not be made in the House ofCommons without telling the German Ambassador before-hand, and Prance and. Italy would also have to be informed in advance.    It followed, therefore, that communicationsmust be made to the three Ambassadors in advance ofthe Debate.   But it was clear that it would be useless to formulate, and most dangerous to announce, furtherpolicy until the reactions of the three countries(and possibly of other countries) were known.   We must-keep our hands free so as to be in a position todetermine our future policy.In the course of discussion the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs indicated to the Cabinet the natureof the communication which he proposed to the german ambassador, and invited the views of the Cabinet on two questions:    (l) as to how much of the information in our possession regarding German re-armament it would
be desirable to tell the Ambassador:    and (2) whether he should end. his communication with or without a request for the views or observations of the GermanGovernment.As regards (l), general agreement was expressed with the view that, while it would be undesirable togive the Ambassador detailed, facts and figures ofGermanyfs re-armament such as those contained inAppendix I of C .P.-2S5 (34), it would be as well to concentrate on three or four of the more salient features of that re-armament and point out, for examplethat whereas Germany was allowed by the Treaty anarmy of 100,000 men she now, to the best of our know-ledge and belief, had a very much larger army, and thatwhile the Treaty allowed her no military air force,she had formed, we had reason to believe, such a force, which included a number of bombing planes,A communication on these lines would not disclose any source of information and would show the Germans thatwe were not ignorant of their proceedings.In regard, to (3) it was pointed out that a decision was involved of as grave a nature as any taken sincethe War.   By inviting the observations or views of theGerman Government on the facts, we might be taking thefirst steps towards the resumption of general disarm-ament discussions with Germany.    On the other hand,doubts were expressed as to whether the time had arrived, to put this question to Germany.    If our objective was &quot;controlled&quot; re-armament by Germanyit would be dangerous to be drawn into discussions with her until the question had been examined with france and Italy, and possibly other Powers.   Generalagreement was expressed, with the view that, in his statement to the German Ambassador, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should refrain from inviting
the observations of the German Government or from making any reference to the ultimate resumption of conversations on disarmament, and should considerthe desirability of using words to the effect thatno doubt the Ambassador would communicate the statement to his Government.It was mentioned that the point might be madein the House of Commons that, although the Governmenthad for a long time known the facts in regard to german re-armament, they had delayed taking action until just before the Debate was to take place.On the other hand it was pointed out, inter alia,that the re-armament of Germany had only quite recentlybecome an acute question.   We had. just received informa-tion that German re-armament was proceeding at a muchquicker rate than we had previous!;/ had reason tos uppose,The Cabinet then considered, the question of thestatement to be made in the Debate regarding theGovernment&apos;s Air expansion programme.    It was urgedthat it would be advantageous, both from the pointof view of the Debate and of the deterrent effect on germany, if the programme for the provision of 22Air Squadrons for Home Defence and. 3 Squadrons forthe Fleet Air Arm in the next four years could be accelerated, so as to enable these Squadrons to bemade available in two years&apos; time.The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to conclusion (c) on page 6 of CI.D. Paper Wo. 1150-B,and. pointed out that there was nothing in our informa-tion in regard to German preparations to justify theproposed acceleration.    Secondly, he reminded the
Cabinet of the views of the Air Ministry that their programme, as at present arranged, was as much as could be accomplished efficiently and without waste of money and effort.   thirdly, the proposal wouldinvolve a Supplementary Estimate this year of 250,000 and an expenditure of at least  500,000 nextyear, and still heavier sums in later years .   In thisconnection the Chancellor of the Exchequer drew theattention of the Cabinet to the number of items of
1.11increased and new expenditure which would have to hemet and. which would involve a net addition to theBudget next year of no less a sum than  36,500,000.The position was a very serious one, and. he felt houndto warn the Cabinet against incurring fresh commitments,having regard, to the very grave difficulty of findingadditional revenue to meet the increased expenditure.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the recommendations containedin the Report of the Cabinet Committee on german Re-armament (CP.-265 (34)) as setout at the beginning   of this Conclusion:(b) That, at his interview, before the Debate,with the German Ambassador, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should makethe statement in regard to German re-armament on the lines discussed by theCabinet, and, in particular, should indicate to the Ambassador three or foursalient features of that re-armament,in such a way as to show that we are&quot;well aware of Germany&apos;s activities in thematter:(c) That, at the interview in question, theSecretary of State should refrain frominviting the observations of the GermanGovernment or from making any referenceto the ultimate resumption of conversations on disarmament, and. should consider thedesirability of using words to the effectthat no doubt the Ambassador would eommu-communicate the statement to his Government:(d) To take note that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs proposed, to make asuitable communication to the american ambassador as well as to the French andItalian Ambassadors:(e) To take note that th^Seeretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs was communicatingthe conclusions reached by the Cabinetto the Dominions:(f) To take note that, in the view of theFirst Lord of the Admiralty, it will bevery difficult, if not impossible, toavoid reference in the Debate to far eastern issues and, in particular, to questions connected, with the Navaldiscussions now taking place in london with the American and Japanese Delegations:(g) As regards Conclusion (f) of CP.-265 (.54),to take note\of the technical and. financial considerations outlined by the Chancellorof the Exchequer at the Meeting and summarised above in regard, to the acceleration-tion of the Air Force Programme.   In view,however, of the gravity of the position.
-quite approve the proposed acceleration of the Programme, so as to provide the22 Squadrons for Home Defence and 3Squadrons for the Fleet Air Arm in twoyears&apos; time:(h) That the Lord President of the council should speak in the Debate afterMr Winston Churchill, and that theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should wind, up the Debate on behalf ofthe Government:(i) That the Committee on German Re-armamentshould continue in being and should beinvited to examine the situation arising in consequence of the Debate in the. Rouse of Commons, and should submit afurther Report to the Cabinet with theleast possible delay thereafter.
