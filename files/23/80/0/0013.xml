With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the following Question to be asked that afternoon in the Eouse of lords by Viscount Cecil of Chelwood:-&quot;^o ask whether the President of theCouncil was correctly reported, assaying that a collective peacesystem is impracticable in view ofthe fact today that the United states is not yet a member of the league ofNations and that Germany and. Japanhave both retired from it, andwhether that means that it is thepolicy of the Government to abandonso much of the system of the Leagueof Nations as is contained in Article 16of the Covenant and to revert in that respect to the pre-war international system:    and. to move for Papers.&quot;Considerable debate on this Question might be antici-pated, and arrangements had. been made for theGovernment Spokesman to be fully and adequatelybriefed in the matter.The Cabinet took note that theParliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs would reply to Viscount Cecil of Chelwood,and that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs would supply copiesof the brief which had been prepared,for Lord. Stanhope to the Secretaryof state for War, the Secretary ofState for Air and the President ofthe Board of Education, in case itmight be found necessary or desirable for a Cabinet Minister to intervene in the Debate.
THESAAB,2. With reference to the Conclusion mentioned i^.^8the margin, the cabinet.net had before them the following/previouspeference:       documents on the subject of the Saar-:-cabinet 43C&quot;g4)   Con- A Memorandum by the Secretary of Stateelusion 3.) for War f CP.-277 (34)) stating that he&apos;. had investigated the facts relating tothe employment of an International Forcet(L - in Upper Silesia in 1921-28 for thepurpose of preserving order, and covering a historical note on the subject:A Note by the Prime Minister (CP.-285(34)) recording the following conclusions reached, as a result of discussions sincethe previous Meeting of the Cabinet, inregard to the possibility of the UnitedKingdom being asked, to contribute to aninternational force for the purpose of keeping order in the Saar in connectionwith the forthcoming plebiscite:-(a) That if the Council of the league should decide, as a result of theinformation laid before them, thatit was desirable for an. international force to be stationed in the Saar forthe purpose of maintaining order inconnection with the fortheomingPlebiscite, and Great Britain was invited to co-operate in this matter,then, provided other countries wereprepared to make a contribution, weshould also be prepared to lend assist-ance on the express condition that both France and Germany agreed, to thisarrangement:(b) That if such an offer should, emanatefrom the League, great importance is.attached to making the composition ofany such force as international in character as possible, and that besidescontingents from Italy and Great Britain,it was desirable that contingents shouldbe made available from. Belgium and.Holland, and also from Switzerland, ifthis country was prepared to make thenecessary special arrangements:(c) That the actual method of handling this&quot;question at Geneva should, be   left tothe discretion of the Lord. Privy Seal,who will be in telephonic touch withthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.    It is understood that theprobable procedure will, be for Mr Eden .to give information to the French and.Italian representatives at Geneva onthe lines indicated in conclusions (a)and fb) above, on Wednesday morning,5th December, and that he would, followthis up with a statement to the Councilon Wednesday afternoon:(d.) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, arrange to give lnforraa-tion   on the lines of conclusions (a)and (b) above, to the German and Italian-2-
Ambassadors, the actual date of theseinterviews to be left to his discretion in the light of information which theLord Privy Seal may be able to sendfrom Geneva:(e) That the question of the most suitable time at which to inform the Dominions,should, the proposal to send, a Britishcontingent to the Saar materialise,should be agreed between the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs:(f) That consideration will have to be given at Geneva as to the payment of theexpenses of any international force whichit may be decided -to send, to the Saar.The Note drew attention to the points whichwere taken into consideration in arriving at the above conclusions, and to certain matters which would have to be organised in advance in the event of a decision beingtaken to send a British force to the Saar.At the outset of the discussion the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs drew attention totelegrams 106, 108, 109, 111 and 112 which had just been received from the Lord Privy Seal at Geneva.That afternoon the Council of the League would meet in public session and discuss the first part of theAloisi Report which was concerned with general andjuridical considerations.      The Council might perhaps also refer to the second part of the Reportrelating to future arrangements respecting the mines, etc.After this it was expected that the council would go into private session when no doubt M. Lavalwould make the statement referred to in the lord privy Seal&apos;s telegram No. 108:&quot;They had no desire whatever to enter the saar and would themselves much prefer thatothers should undertake the task.     MonsieurLaval had said this in the Chamber and hadbeen loudly applauded.      If, however, thiscourse were not possible then clearly theFrench Government could not deny their responsibility towards their own people ofwhom there was a number in the Saar.    Theywould therefore ask the Council to authorise
action&apos; by French Gardes-Mobiles at therequest of the Governing Commission shouldemergency arise.      They would also ask atthe Council to-morrow other powers concerned, particularly the United Kingdomand Italy,  to join in such action.    MonsieurLaval very earnestly hoped that we should see our way to do so.      If we could not,he.had no douot we would at least endorseresolution authorising action by the Frenchand authorising also other States who mightbe willing to take their share of theresponsibility to do so jointly with them.&quot;It should be observed that the Lord Privy Sealhad told M. Laval that he would pass on what he had said to London and would give him a definite statementof our position in the morning.      It was there for every difficult for the Lord Privy Seal to avoid giving M. Laval an answer.At the private session of the CouncilMr. Knox was expected to make his statement and to add that while no doubt the arrangements covered bythe Aloisi Report alleviated the position to someextent, he was satisfied that the Saar commission was not strong enough to meet the emergency withwhich it might at any moment be faced.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos;then read to the Cabinet telegram No.  112 from geneva, and in particular drew attention to t he-following passages:&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government appear to havethe choice of four courses:1. We can approve the use of french troops in the Saar if called upon by GoverningCommission in an emergency.      We .can statethat we will ourselves send a contingent toassist.2. We can authorise the use of french troops in such emergency and refuse ourselves to send a contingent.3, We can decline either to send a con-tingent ourselves or to authorise the FrenchGovernment to do so.
4. We can follow the procedure set out in conclusions reached at meeting of ministers on December 3rd (CP, 285).If we adopt either 1 or 2 we shall heauthorising the use of French troops in the saar even in interim period following the plebiscite when the Saar may have voted for germany.      If we adopt 3 we shall be deprivingMr. Knox of one factor which has enable him tohold the situation up to date.      I am, there-fore, still of opinion that 4 is the correctcourse to follow.&quot;In the course of discussion attention was drawn to telegram No.  106 relating to the questionwhether Germany?s consent is legally necessaryfor the despatch of an international force to the Saar.It was generally agreed that whatever the exact legal position might be, it would be politicallyimpracticable to send such a fore,   to the Saarin the face of German opposition.      In this connection,the view was expressed that it would suffice if germany gave us an assurance that she would consent to the proposal.  She would be much more lifcely11to give an assurance to us than to Geneva.The Cabinet next considered the composition of the international foroe and emphasis was laid on the desirability of prescribing in advance whoour partners in the venture should oe.      In thisconnection it was suggested that the wording of cp. 285 (54), paragraph 2(b) was inconsistent with the wording of Cabinet 43 (34) Conclusion 3 (b).Moreover, it was pointed out that in so far as theCabinet Conclusion in question had been based oniwhat was understood to have been done in the case of11the Upper Silesian plebiscite and on other similarIIoccasions, the understanding itself was not inifaccordance with the facts as was shown in theMemorandum of the Secretary of State for War, CP. 27Y (34),:;&apos;
General agreement was expressed with thevie?;- that our participation in an international forceinter aliamust be subject/to the following conditions:-(l)    There must be an invitation from theCouncil of the League.(2)    In no circumstances could we undertaketo send a force to the Saar singlehanded though any force we do send mustbe strong enough to look after itself.(3)    The international force must includeItaly and a number of other foreigncountries, and should, if possible, includeHolland, Belgium and Switzerland.(4)    The number of participating countries should,  if possible, be not less than four,  out we should not rule out from consideration the participation of only three countries, provided that the thirdcountry was an important neutral, i.e.Holland or Spain.(5)    That in any case the inclusion of eitherFrance or Germany cannot be entertainedand that the inclusion of Soviet russia would not be desirable.(6)    That both France and Germany must agreeto the proposal.(7)    That the international force must be sentto the Saar before the plebiscite on the .principle that prevention is better thancure.(8)    That the cost of the international force must in our view form part of the costof the plebiscite.The Cabinet agreed:That Cabinet 43 (34) Conclusion 3 and cp.  285 (34) must be interpreted inthe light of these conclusions, and thatfor purposes of record this conclusionshould be specially noted on theSecretary&apos;s copy of Cabinet 43 (34)Conclusion 3.
The Cabinet then discussed the procedure to befollowed, and emphasis was laid on the great import-ance of not committing ourselves at Geneva in any wayuntil we are certain that Germany*s consent to theproposed arrangements will be forthcoming.The view was also expressed that it would be very desirable if we eould arrange for some Country otherthan Great Britain to take the initiative at Geneva.Our position would be much simplified, if, for example,Italy would, take the initiative.   If, however, as wasto be anticipated, S. Mussolini was not prepared toshoulder this burden, perhaps the President of theCouncil (m. Benes) would undertake the task.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To invite the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs -(i) To communicate at once with HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlininforming him of the position andinstructing him to ascertainGermanyrs reactions to the pro-posals.      (For Despatch to Sir E.Phjpps see Telegram. No.226 (Appendix).)(ii) To make a similar communication atonce to the German Ambassador inLondon:(iii) To communicate the proposals withoutdelay to S, Mussolini, through his Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome,and also siimultaneously to informthe Italian Ambassador in London:(iv) To confer in regard to the proposalsforthwith with the Belgian ambassador and the Netherlands Minister   in London, andin the latter case strongly torepresent the desirability of holland participating in the inter-national force if constituted:(v) To make a similar communication toHis Majestyfs Ambassador in paris and. to request the Lord Privyto confer with M. Laval at geneva on the same lines:(vi) To inform the Lord Privy Seal ofthe view of the Cabinet that itwould be very dangerous for himto make any definite statementuntil it was known for certainthat Germany accepted the proposal and that it would, be desirable ifhe oould limit himself to-7-
emphasising the point thatthis matter is a responsibilityof the Council of the League asa whole, and that prevention inany case is better than cure.It might also be suggested, tothe Lord Privy Seal&quot;that therewas much to be said at the moment for obtaining an adjournmentafter reference had&apos;been made tothe subject in most general terms:(b) That a meeting with the Lobby Correspondentsshould be arranged, at which the position should, be explained in as objective a manner as possible.   The responsibility of theLeague of Nations should, be emphasised,the general situation should, be described,and. the various courses of action open tothe League should, be indicated, but without giving any hint as to the course of action,if any, we were disposed to favour:(c) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should arrange for the despatch to the Dominions of a telegram, stating the position in very general terms:    the text of this telegram to be agreed withthe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and to be approved by the Prime minister before actual despatch.

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthe only matter in connection with Reduction and limitation of Armaments which was tinder consideration at the moment was the American Draft dealing with trade in and manufacture of arms and the establish-ment of a Permanent Disarmament Commission.   Thiswas being considered by the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee under the Chairmanship of the Lord privy seal.   The Prime Minister emphasised, the desirabilityof the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committeebeing ready for consideration by the Cabinet withas little delay as practicable.   In the meantimehe proposed to continue this subject on the agenda paper.

With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet were informed that a meeting had taken place with the American Delegates on theprevious evening, at which the question had beendiscussed of the procedure to be adopted if Japandenounced the Washington Treaty on the 13th December,as had been rumoured.   the Americans had maintained that if Japan took such action it would be equivalentto ending the present Conversations.The Cabinet were informed, that it must not beassumed that Japan would, actually give notice todenotince the Treaty on the 13th December.   She had nothing to gain, so far as we knew, by givingpremature notice, and it might be that, even if herdecision to denounce was irrevocable, she would, not give actual notice until the 31st December.    In themeantime the Conversations were proceeding, and thepossibility of reaching a satisfactory settlement-remained open.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (CP.-281 (34)) putting forward the two following objections to the employment of a judge to preside over the Committee of Inquiry intothe Private Manufacture of, and Trading in. Arms(l) The increased delay in the dischargeof judicial business which must result from the detachment of a Judge:(2) The disastrous effects on the judicialoffice of the employment of a Judgefor non-judicial purposes.At the end of his Memorandum the Lord Chancellormentioned the names of distinguished lawyers whopossessed in a high degree the qualities required inthe Chairman of the Inquiry.In the course of discussion, reference was madeto a letter signed by Viscount Cecil of Chelwood,the Bishop of Chelmsford and others, which had appeared in the Press on December 4th, advocating that the inquiry should take the form of a Royal commission with very wide terms of reference.   Having regard- tothis and other considerations, the importance of having a Judge to preside over the Inquiry was againstrongly emphasised.    In this connection the suggestion was made that one of the Northern Ireland or ScottishJudges might be considered for this appointment.The Cabinet agreed  To invite the secretary of State forForeign Affairs to circulate for con-siteration at their next Meeting aMemorandum containing suggestionscovering (a) the Terms of Reference,(b) the Chairman, and (c) the composition of the proposed Commission of Inquiry.(The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsleft the Meeting of the Cabinet at this pointIn order to take immediate action to giveeffect to the Conclusions reached by the Cabinetin regard to the Saar.)-12-

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (CP.-279 (34))circulating for the information of his colleagues acopy of a telegram he had received from the Governmentof India, dated November 29th, giving their general view that the scheme recommended in the Report of theJoint Select Committee on India provided a sound.foundation on which to frame a Bill.   The Secretaryof State had also received telegrams from all theProvincial. Governors giving the views of their governments on the Report.   All the Provinces had(either in substance or in terms) supported, the proposition that the Joint select CommitteeTs report should be taken as the basis of the proposed. Bill.The Secretary of State for India thought that itwould be generally agreed, that the reception in india of the Report of the Joint Select Committee might beregarded, as satisfactory.   There were two matters onwhich decisions of the Cabinet were required:-(l) The Resolution for next week&apos;s debate in the House of Commons on the Reportof the Joint Select Committee shouldbe put down that day.The Secretary of State then read to the Cabinetthe following text of a draft Resolution:-&quot;That this House accepts the recommenda-tlons of the Joint Select Committee on indian const it. utional reform as a fairbasis for the revision of the indian constitution and considers it expedient that a Bill should be introduced on thegeneral lines of the Report&quot;.(2) It would not be possible to have a draftof the Bill ready before the beginningof next January, and the Secretary ofState desired, to publish the Bill not later than January 22nd.If the Bill was to be examined by the India Committeeof the Cabinet before it was considered by the cabinet itself, the Committee must hold meetings on and. afterthe 7th January, and, in view of the shortage of time,-13-
it would &quot;be desirable if the rule which required thatthe Bill should be referred to the Committee of HomeAffairs could, be dispensed with on this occasion.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, asa result of further examination of the parliamentary time-table, it would be necessary for the House ofCommons to meet again after the Christmas Recesson January 22nd and not on January 29th, as had been previously contemplated.   A Meeting of the cabinet would have to be held in the week preceding January22nd, and the India Bill could be considered at thisMeeting.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve generally the Secretary ofSta,t e for Ind ia * s draft Resolut ion,subject to further consideration ofthe advisability of omitting theadjective before the word, &quot;basis&quot;,in the third, line., and to invite theSecretary of State for India to settle the final form of the Resolution inconsultation with the Prime Ministerand the Lord.

Cor-clusion 4.)n&amp;C The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-278 (34))stating that he had been approached by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for War with aview to the transfer from Army Votes to Civil votes of the cost of the Civil Air Defence Services.   Theexpenditure in question included the cost of certainwork carried out by the Chemical Defence research department and, in the last two years, the salaries of the Air Raid Commandant and. his Staff   Officer.After explaining why this expenditure had hithertoremained as a charge on Army Votes, and stating thatit was the ordinary and salutary rule that the Depart-ment which had the main responsibility for controllinga particular head of expenditure should account forthat expenditure to Parliament, the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to agree to the request of his twocolleagxies and to arrange that this expenditure should,beginning with the next financial year, be borne ona special subhead or subheads of the Home Office Vote.In view, however, of the political considerations involved, he considered that Cabinet authority shouldbe obtained.The Cabinet/were informed by the Home secretary that he was on the point of circulating to the cabinet for consideration, the Report of the Air Raids Pre-cautions (Policy) Sub-Committee.The Cabinet agreed  -To approve the proposal of theChancellor of the Exchequer thatas from the beginning of the next financial year the cost of civil air Defence Services should betransferred from Army Votes to CivilVotes and should be borne on aspecial subhead or subheads of theHome Office Vote.-17-
POUSTNG- 10,   With reference to the Gone Tub ion mentionedin the margin, the Minister of Health informed theprevious Cabinet that he had conferred, with the Chancellor ofReference:Cabinet 43 the Exchequer on the financial aspects of the Bill(34), Con-clusion 15.) with the object, without unduly increasingthe cost of the subsidy.       of making the Billmore attractive to the Local Authorities.The financial provisions would be altered, in tworespects.    In the first place it was proposed toincrease the maximum for the cottage subsidy by raising the period for which the subsidy could bepaid from 10 to 30 years.    In the second place it was proposed to increase the ratio of the Exchequer contri-bution to the Local Authority contribution by raising the ratio from fifty-fifty, prescribed by the Bill,to a ratio of two to one over the whole range of the subsidies to be given.   The Cabinet would remember that it had been decided that, in order to encourageLocal Authorities to proceed with schemes without waiting for the Bill to become law, approved schemes submitted after the introduction of the Bill wouldrank for subsidy.    It was clear, however, that theLocal Authorities would be likely to concentrate oncottage rather than on flat schemes, and. for thereasons which he explained, to the Cabinet the Ministerof Health thought that in the circumstances it wouldbe more prudent to draw a distinction between flatsand cottages, and, while enabling flat schemes to rankfor subsidy as from the introduction of the Bill, toprovide that cottage schemes should, only rank forsubsidy as from the date when the Bill became law.After considerable discussion, in the course ofwhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the cabinet a full explanation of the position, of the reasons which had. led. the Cabinet Committee to accept the scheme-IP-
of subsidies embodied in the Bill, and of his accept-ance of the present proposals of the Minister ofHealth, being subject to an assurance (which theMinister had given) that it would be possible tomaintain the position in Committee, the Cabinet agreed -To approve the proposals of the Ministerof Health -(a) For increasing the maximum forthe cottage subsidy by raising the period for which the subsidycould be    paid from 10 to 20 years:(b) To increase the ratio of theExchequer contribution to theLocal Authority contribution by raising the ratio from fifty-fifty,prescribed by the Bill, to a ratio of two to one over the whole range of the subsidies to be given:subject to the condition that onlyin the case of flats should schemesrank for subsidy before the dateof the passage of the Bill into law.-lo.

APPENDIX.Cypher telegram to Sir Eric Phipps,  (Berlin),Foreign Office, 5th December, 1934, 2.50 p.m.No.  226.MOST IMMEDIATE AND SECRET.1.      Mr. Eden reports from Geneva that this afternoon M. Laval is expected to make some statement in private session of the Council about the french attitude to providing in case of emergency some kindof force to preserve or restore order in the Saar.It is believed that M. Laval will take up theposition that France wo^.ld much prefer that othersshould undertake the task.      He is certain to insist that if an international force drawn from other sources is impossible, any French aid should be givenonly upon the authority of the Council and to press that the United Kingdom and Italy, for example, should in case of need, join in such action.2.      Y/e fully appreciate the objection to any French contribution and have been considering what our answer would be if the Council ask for any international force, to make sure that good order is kept during the plebiscite, which is composed ofcontingents from several countries, excluding bothFrance and Germany.      But before.we analyse this possibility further, we should like to know whetherthe German Government would be prepared to express their approval of such an arrangement.3.      You should make immediate enquiries toascertain very confidentially the German reaction.As the German Government know, we have   -repeatedly insisted that we are determined to do what
we can to secure that the plebiscite is carried through quietly and in due order.     V/hile we do not see any reason to anticipate disturbance if calminginfluences are exercised in all quarters, at thesame time, prevention is better than cure.      Thereis therefore a good deal to be said for the purely temporary presence of an international forceinside the Saar Defore the plebiscite takes place and for the short time afterwards until the decision is carried through.      But for this purpose it isessential:(l) that the force should be international and not limited to a single Power;(2) that neither Prance nor Germany should contribute, since both are interested parties.For your own information only, we also feel that both Prance and Germany should consent to such anarrangement, but of course you will not offerGermany a free veto.4.      You should most strongly insist that this enquiry is both secret and provisional.      The proper course to take if Germany raised objection remains to be considered.      But we make this enquiry most urgently now and ask for a confidential reply because we wish to do everything possible as a member ofthe Council to secure that all passes off smoothly.Repeated to Paris No.  164, Geneva No. 118.
