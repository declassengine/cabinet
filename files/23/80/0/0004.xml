GERMANY.Trade Negotia-tlons with.(previous reference erene e:Cabinet 34( 34), C on-clusion 8.)FA37(31.   With reference to the Conclusion mentioned, inthe margin, the Cabinet were reminded by the Presidentof the Board of Trade that the Clearing Agreement which sir Frederick Leith-Ross on his return to Berlinproposed to the German representatives, was based onthe principle that, the Clearing Office to be set upin the United Kingdom collected sterling from Britishimporters of German goods, and the Reichsbank inGermany collected the Reichsmarks of German importersof British goods.   Then the Clearing Office in theUnited Kingdom would, meet the demands of our exportersin sterling, and the Reichsbank would meet the demand of the German exporters in Reichsmarks .   This might be described as a &quot;double account system&quot;, on much thesame lines as the Clearing arrangements which germany had made with Switzerland, Holland, Sweden and France.During the last three weeks there had been signs thatthese Clearing arrangements were breaking down, andit was evident that there was considerable danger thatif we now adopted this particular system we might find it unworkab1e almost from the start.Greatly to his (the President&apos;s) surprise, he hadbeen informed on the previous day that Germany would much prefer that the Anglo-German Clearing arrangement should be based on what was known as a &quot;single accountsystem&quot;.   Under this system the Clearing Office herewould collect the sterling from. British importers ofGerman goods and would, pay it into an account in thename of the Reichsbank at the Bank of England.   the sterling would be divided into the agreed, proportions  55% being allocated to the needs of current trade,12% (or 10%) being allocated to the liquidation of outstanding debts, and the balance being at the freedisposal of the Reichsbank, subject to proper under-takings as to the service of the Dawes and Young Loans,
and the re-export and Colonial trades.    The 55$ andthe 10$ would then he at the disposal of the Reichsbankfor allocation, to German importers in order to pay for current and previous imports of British goods into germany.There could be no doubt that a Clearing arrangementbased entirely on sterling was preferable to a Clearingarrangement based on both sterling and reichsmarks.The principal objection to the &quot;single account system&quot;was that apparently we were going to collect the sterling and hand, it over to the Germans to do whatthey liked with, but Sir Frederick Leith-Ross had nowstated that the Germans were ready, if we would agreeto a &quot;single account system&quot;, to give us any sort ofcontrol over the money that we wanted.Sir Frederick Leith-Ross proposed to insist thatthe Reiohsbank should only have the right to draw ontheir account at the Bank of England upon certaindefinite conditions.   These would be that the Reichsbankshould require any German importer applying forsterling to produce evidence of   his debt, coupled with a certificate from a Chamber of Commerce in thiscountry that the goods in question were united Kingdomproduce or manufacture.   The Reichsbank would, thendraw a cheque, which would have to be counter-signed by the Clearing Office here after examination of the documents produced to the Reichsbank.    In this waythere would be absolute security that the money inthe account was not in any way misused.To guard against the possibility of the Reichsbankrefusing to operate the account in a reasonable mannerit was proposed that our Clearing Office would onlycontinue to&apos; pass sterling into the Reichsbank account at the Bank of England provided that they were satisfied from day to day that the account was being-2-
properly operated.In conclusion, the President of the Board of trade said that, given close control and. auditing on theselines, he thought that the &quot;single aocount system&quot; wasto he preferred to the &quot;double account system&quot;, andthat it could be satisfactorily presented to the trading community as a system combining all reasonablesecurity with a minimum of disturbance to ordinarytrade channels and an elimination of the Exchange risk.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinetthat he agreed, generally with the view   of the Presidentof the Board of Trade that the proposed &quot;single accountsystem&quot; was, from our point of view, a better one thanthe &quot;double account system&quot; .   Certain uns at is fa ot oryfactors remained, and itr-was doubtful whether the system would not result in a further reduction of German exportswith a consequential jeopardising of the Standstillarrangements.   He (the Chancellor of the Exchequer)had just received a message from Berlin to the effect-that the Germans were prepared to give certain furtherassurances for which we had. asked.The President of the Board of Trade said that,assuming the Cabinet were prepared to approve the linenow being taken in the negotiations in Berlin, there remained the question of herrings, which might giverise to difficulty and which he suggested should bereferred to a small Committee empowered to deal withthe mat t er.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated, that a telephone message from Berlin had. been received statingthat Dr. Ulrlch agreed, that exchange certificatesshould not be reduced in an arbitrary fashion or withoutfull consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government, andalso agreed, that in no event should, our exports of coal-3-
under the Exchange of Notes of Aorjl    39P3   hereduced, and that if reductions in other goods arenecessary, special regard should be had to our desireto maintain in adequate volume our exports of herringstextiles and bunker coal.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposal that sir Frederick Leith-Ross should,be authorised to proceed with thetrade negotiations at Berlin for a clearing Agreement based, on the&quot;single aocount system.&quot;, on the linesexplained to the Cabinet and summarised in this Conclusion:(b) That the questions which had arisen in the Anglo-German Trade negotiations in regard to herrings should be refer-r e d for e x am i. ha t i on and s e 111 em ent t oa Committee composed as follows  The Chancellor of the Exchequer,&quot;Tie Secretary of State for Scotland,The President- of the Board, of Trade,The Minister of AgricuIture andFisheries  and that, having regard, to the interestsof Northern Ireland&apos;In the subject, arepresentative of the Home secretary should be invited, to participate Inthe Gommittee&apos;s deliberations *(NOTE: The President of the Board of Tradeleft, the Cabinet at this point toattend the Funeral Service to the1ate Earl Buxton.)
EGYPT(Previousjfeferenoe :Kbinftt 32(34), Con-elusion 6.)Mm)&apos;-2. The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-229(34))  on the subject of Egypt, in which he recalled that when the general lines of policy indicated inhis previous Paper (C .P.-215 (34)) had. been approvedby the Cabinet at the Meeting, referred to in the margin, these lines of policy assumed that upon KingFuadTs death it would be possible for us, by theexercise of suitable influence, to &quot;secure a Regencyand/or Cabinet acceptable to Egypt and.to His majesty&apos;s government&quot;, and that in order to do so it might benecessary to secure the immediate adjournment of theEgyptian Parliament after the reading of the XingTsnominees for the Regency,   The Acting High Commissionerhad now expressed considerable doubt whether thesedesiderata could be obtained aft.er the King&apos;a death by action on our part, and this had led him more and more to favour the exercise of our influence to attaincorresponding ends before the King actually died.The present Egyptian Prime Minister, on his own initiative, had raised with the Acting High Gornmis-sioner questions arising out of the possible death of king Fuad, and had insisted that the impending situation was one which would involve the joint responsibilityof Britain and Egypt.    In effect, therefore, theFgyptian Prime Minister was ashing for our advice,and the Acting High Commissioner had urged that whatwas most needed was to remove from their position of influence the men who were chiefly responsible forthe discredit into which the Egyptian Government had fallen, of whom the chief were Xbrashi, the &quot;Controller&quot;at the Palace, and. contractor politicians, like Abboud,and two other members of the present Ministry.   TheEgyptian Prime Minister had rejected the Acting HighCommissioner&apos;s advice and had betrayed his confidence.-5-
The res tilt was that/Ibrashi faction was   endeavouringto create the impression that an attempt was beingmade to tamper with Egyptian rights of self-government.The Acting High Commissioner now wished to takeadvantage of the somewhat improved health of King Fuadto seek a personal interview with the King, and there and then to recommend. . to him the course which he had previously unsuccessfully recommended to his PrimeMinister and to ask King Fuad, on the authority ofHis Majesty.1 s Government, to summon a new ministry and to make Tewfik Nessim Pasha (a former PrimeMinister and one of the elder statesmen) head, of theGovernment,   The Secretary of State entertained the gravest, doubt whether the course recommended, by the acting High Commissioner should be followed in thepresent circumstances, and sunmarised. in his memorandum the difficulties he felt.   He therefore advised thatit should be made known that the Acting High Commis-sioner&apos;s advice was tendered in response to the PrimeMinister&apos;s request, but that when the Acting HighCommissioner was granted an audience with the Kinghe should not press for changes which he was not certain to get.   When the King died it was more than-probable that the Regency he had nominated would be wholly unsatisfactory, and if as a result there weregrave dissatisfaction in Egypt and every indication that confusion and disorder would, occur, we might thenbe able to intervene with effect and. more general acceptance.   The Secretary of State felt, however,that if we tried to force our recommendations on egypt at the present moment the result would be tomake the effectiveness of our own action&apos; hereaftermuch less certain,
In amplification of the information contained in .P.-229 (34)  the Cabinet were informed that in all probability the condition of King Fuad was very muchmore serious than was stated in the medical bulletinsIn reply to an enquiry as to what step he pro-posed to take if King fuad either refused to accord,an interview or declined to take his advice, the acting High Commissioner had stated that he would propose to renew his application.Since the Memorandum was written, the Press, both at home and. in Egypt, had made it known that the acting High Commissionerfs advice had been tenderedin response to the request of the Egyptian PrimeMinister, and had not merely been volunteered byMr Peterson.   The British High Commissioner, who was at home on leave, agreed with the proposed action ofthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and hewould, of course, return at once to Egypt should thenecessity arise, e.g., in the event 0+ Vine Fuad.&apos;sdeath.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the action which theSecretary of State fo&quot;j ForeignAffairs proposed to take in regardto the present position in. Egyptas set out in paragraph 8 of 6.P.-229(34), and in particular to adopt theadvice of tbe Secreta7&quot;/ of State thatwhen the Actins High Commissionerobtains his audience with King Fuadhe should, not press for changes whichhe was not certain to get.
REDUCTION ANDIMITATION of armaments.The Diearma-merit Confer-ene e.t previous reference:Cabinet 35(34), Con-elusion 6.)3, The Cabinet were informed that it would be highly desirable that the question of the present-position of the Disarmament Conference should bec ons considered in the immediate future ,The Cabinet agreed  That this question should be placedon the Agenda Paper for the next-Meeting of the Cabinet.fill. ^
PRIVATE 4, With reference to the Conclusion of the CabinetIamjpacturbARMS. mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet had before theme Inquiry in     a Report by the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament&amp;e UnitedStates of (C,P.-230 (34)) on the subject of what action mightlinerica *be recommended, if, as soon as Parliament meets, theReoort of ministerial question is raised as to whether or not it is proposed committee.to set up an Inquiry, similar to the SenatorialIfPrevious Inquiry in the United States of America, into the reference:Cabinet 34 circumstances of the trade in arms carried on by-(34), Con-inclusion 6;)        British firms.   The Committee had explored generallyvarious methods by which the Government might mostafi/soumise *    satisfactorily meet a considerable volume of publicopinion which was genuinely exercised, on the questionof private manufacture of arms as a result of theAmerican Arms Inquiry, without in any way.endangeringthe private armament industry in this country, which,it was generally accepted, was vital to the mainten-ahce of British security.   The Committee felt thatthe manufacture and trade in arms was an internationalconcern, and accordingly agreed to set up an inter-Departmental Committee, under the Chairmanship of theLord Privy Seal, with, instructions to prepare, for theconsideration of the Committee, a draft Conventiondealing with the control and supervision of the tradein, and manufacture of, arms such as the United kingdom could put forward as a self-contained proposal for international adoption.   The inter-DepartmentalCommittee had further been instructed to report veryurgently on this question, in view of the fact thatit was possible that the United States of Americamight contemplate taking the initiative in thematter. . -
After a brief dls.etJSs.ion, in the course of whichthe Cabinet were reminded of the dangers to thiscountry involved in some hard and fast resolutionbeing adopted at Geneva to the effect that the private manufacture of arras should cease, the Cabinet agreed.  fa) To take note that the ministerial committee had set up an Inter-Departmental Committee, under theChairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal,with instructions to prepare, for theconsideration of that Committee, adraft Convention dealing with thecontrol and supervision of the trade In,and manufacture of, arms, such as wecould put forward as a self-containedproposal for international adoption;that this Inter-Departmental Committeehad been instructed to report veryurgently on this question:    and thatthe Ministerial Committee would reportto the Cabinet as soon as practicableafter they had examined the Inter-Dapartmenta1 Committee&apos;s Report;(b) That the question of the line to betaken in regard to this matter on there-assembling of Parliament should, be examined at the next Meeting of theCabinet, and that accordingly thisquestion should be entered, on theAgenda Paper for that Meeting.

IMPERIAL 5. The Cabinet were informed that this question:defence policy. was not yet ripe for consideration, and the ActingSecretary to the Cabinet was instructed to keep it(previous reference: on the Agenda Paper.Cabinet 34(34), Con-clusion 5.)
IMPERIAL 6. In accordance with the Conclusion referred toDEFENCEPOLICY. in the margin, the Cabinet had before them a MostThe Future of Secret Joint Memorandum by the Chancellor of theAnglo-japanese relations. Exchequer and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (C.P.-223 (34)) on the subject of the Future(previous reference: of Anglo-Japanese Relations, with special reference cabinet 35(34), Con- to the possibility of negotiating and entering intoelusion 7,)a non-aggression pact with Japan.   After recountingf,fi, the recent history of the matter the Memorandum setM%$)f- political^ - out the mairyconsiderations which would have to be weighed and borne in mind, and indicated the condi-tions which apparently would have to be fulfilled ifthe objective of a good, and firm understanding with japan was to be attained by such means withoutreactions in other directions so serious as tonullify its good effects.The Cabinet agreed  That consideration of this question should be postponed until further progress had. been made in the Anglo-Japanese Naval discussions.
7.   The Cabinet agreed.  fa) That by Noon on Monday, November 5,19 34, Ministers should send to the acting Secretary to the Cabinet-material for the following:-(i) The King&apos;s Speech on the prorogation of parliament on November 16th:(ii) &quot;The King&apos; s Speech on the Openingof Parliament on November 20th.(b) That a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows - TheTheTheThePrime Minister,Lord President of the Couneil,Chancellor of the Exchequer,Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,&quot;Secretary of State for War(as Leader of the House ofLords) -wshould meet to prepare the King&apos;speeches referred to above.(c) That the Secretary of State for India-should be invited&quot; to attent Meetingsof the Cabinet Committee when theKing1 s Speech on the Opening ofParliament was under consideration.
WESTERN 8.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byWb SECESSION.       the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (C.P.-S25P       3?(3^)7 on the question of the secession of the Stateof Western Australia from the Commonwealth of australian -Hlia.   The Memorandum stated that a recent referendumhad resulted in a considerable majority vote in- favour of secession, and a deputation was now on its way to this country carrying three petitions for presentation respectively to the King, the Rouse ofLords and the House of Commons, praying that legisla-tion might be passed by Parliament to provide for the- separation of Western Australia from the rest of theCommonwealth, and its constitution as a self-governingDominion.   The Secretary of state own view of thesituation,  in brief, was that whatever grounds of complaint Western Australia might have, secession wasnot the right remedy, and he gathered that the attitudeof the Commonwealth Government was likely to be oneof uncompromising resistance to the petitions, and,indeed,  of obstruction at every stage.    In the circum-stances it was clear that, so far as His Majesty *sGovernment in the United Kingdom were concerned, theyshould do their best to maintain the attitude thatthis unfortunate controversy was one which Western Australia and the rest of the Commonwealth must settlebetween themselves.    The Memorandum then explained theprocedure in regard to petitions to Parliament,involving the setting up of a Select Committee of theHouse of Commons to consider not the substance of the petition, but the question of its receivability, inother words, whether the State and people of Western Australia had the right to present a petition toParliament.   The Secretary of State suggested thatif such a Select Committee were appointed and. itsought the views of the Government, they should be-14-
those set out by the Law Officers in reply to theSecretary of State&apos;s questions and quoted in theMemorandum.   As to procedure in the House of lords and the advice to be tendered to the King in regardto the action to be taken on the petition addressedto His Majesty, the Secretary of State suggested that consideration of these questions should be deferred pending a decision as to the receivability of the petition by the House of Commons,    In the meantime the Secretary of State proposed, after formallysubmitting the petition to His Majesty, to arrangefor a suitable interim reply to be sent to Western Australia,Annexed to CP.-225 (34) was a note on the historyof the relations between Western Australia and theCommonwealth, with an. account of the principal&apos;grievances on which the Western Australian case was based.In the course of considerable discussion theCabinet were informed that the High Commissioner forthe Commonwealth of Australia was opposed to the petition being considered by a Select committee butthat if it was referred to such a Committee thecase of the Commonwealth Government in opposition would be laid before the Committee.      The view was expressed that it would be very undesirable ifthe member/^pres exiting the petition entered into the merits of the case as this might Involve a debateraising constitutional questions of great difficulty.The Cabinet discussed the question whether theLeaders in the House of Commons and the House of Lordsrespectively should intervene in the debates and if sowhether they should give any indication as to whatdecision the Houses should take on the petition.-15-
In this connection the Cabinet were reminded thatthe Law Officers had advised that the receivabilityof the proposed petition would depend upon theview which the House of Commons would take,probably after the matter had been considered by a select Committee, as to whether it was convenient to receive the petition. The petition would be presented to both Houses, and, as explained in paper cp. 225 (34), the procedure of the two Houses inregard to petitions was different.      It would be most undesirable and embarrassing if by any chancethe two Houses were to reach different conclusionswith regard to the petition, and it was suggestedthat every effort must be made to avoid thepossibility of this happening.      In this connection the view was expressed that reference of a petitionto a Joint Select Committee of both Houses wouldbe an impracticable course as each house would no doubt object to its procedure being discussed in a Committee some members of whichbelonged to the other House.The suggestion was made that in regardto the House of Commons the advice tendered to the speaker by his Counsel would probably not differ from the opinion of the Law Officers.      If,therefore, the House of Commons had to decide on the basis of convenience much would turn on theattitude of the Commonwealth Government, and it seemed proper that the Government should indicate to the House of Commons the line which in theiropinion the House should take.      In this event,it would be convenient if similar advice could begiven on behalf of the Government to the Houseof Lords.
The Cabinet agreed:-(l)    That on the presentation of the petitionby a Private Member in the House ofCommons, the Leader of the House shouldmake a statement to the effect that in theopinion of the Government the question of thereceivability of the petition should bereferred to a Select Committee of the House.(2)    That the wording of the statement to be madeby the Leader of the House should be settled in advance in consultation with the LawOfficers.(3)    That it was impracticable to contemplatejoint machinery by the two Houses,  such asthe appointment of a Joint Select Committee,but that it would be very embarrassing ifthe two Houses were to reach differentconclusions on the question of the receiva-bility of the petition, and that every effort must be made to ensure that both Housesreach the same conclusion on this question.(The Prime Minister invited his colleagues toscrutinize the above conclusions with particular care and to notify the Acting Secretary of any alterations they might wish to suggest.)(NOTE:    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsleft the Cabinet at this point to attend the Funeral Service of the late Earl Buxton..)
9.    in pursuance of the Conclusion of the cabinet referred, to in the margin, the Cabinet had beforethem a Memorandum by the Home Secretary (O.P.-228(34)) submitting for the information of his colleaguesa report on the cinematograph film of the assassinationsof Kins Alexander and M. Barthou.    Enquiry of theLondon County Council, the most important licensing authority in the country, had elicited that nocomplaints against the film in question had reachedthe Council and. that the film could not be said to be&quot;offensive to public feeling&quot;   the only ground onwhich the Council had power to take any action.Further, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had. come to the conclusion that, so far as his Depart-ment was concerned, no action was called, for.   HomeOffice representatives had. seen the four versions ofthe film and had reached a similar conclusion.    it seemed, clear that in this case the industry hadexercised care to eliminate from, the film anything which could be considered as objectionable, tut theHome Secretary proposed to remind local authorities that the following condition in the licence of practical-ly every cinema in the country was applicable to news-reels as well as to other films:-&quot;No film shall be shown which is likelyto be injurious to morality or to encourageor to Incite to crime or to lead to disorderor to be offensive to public feeling or which contains any offensive representations of!   living persons:    if the Council serve a notice on the licensee that they object tothe exhibition of any film on any of thegroxmds aforesaid that film, shall not be shown&quot; .
In the cotirse of discussion doubts were expressed as to whether the representatives of theHome Office had seen the uncut version of the filmwhich had been publicly shown in many cinemas.   Thisversion was, according to reliable information,highly ob ,j ec t ionable .The suggestion was made that the Home secretary should, see responsible representatives of the film industry and.,  in the course of a very frank and friendly discussion,  convey to them definite warning that the Government could not possibly be indifferent to a repetition of the display of a film like theone in question:    that there was a tendency to gomuch further in this direction than public opinionapproved:    and that the Industry would be well advised to take steps to remedy the position, so as to obviatethe necessity for Government intervention.The Home Secretary undertook to convey to representatives of the Film industry the views of the Cabinet as expressed at the Meetinc .
10. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (CP ,-226 (34)) drawing theattention of his colleagues to the state of business in the Kingfs Bench Division of the Royal Courts ofjustice, and laying before them proposals for removing the congestion which now exists there, and for meeting to some extent the demands which have found utteranceboth in resolutions of the professional societies andin the public Press.   After a comprehensive review ofthe whole position the Lord Chancellor made the follow-ing recommendations:-(l) Immediately to present to Parliamentresolutions under section 11 of theSupreme Court of Judicature (Consoli-dation) Act, 1925, for the appointmentof Judges of the King&apos;s Bench division in the place of Lord Justice Roche andof Mr Justice Acton.(8) That authority should be given to the attorney-General, when moving theResolution in the Rouse of Commons,and to myself, when moving the Resolu-tion in the House of Lords, to announce that it is intended to make further provision for increasing temporarilythe number of Judges in the King*bench Division.(3) To present to Parliament at the earliest opportunity a Bill providing for -(a) the raising of the normal numberof King&apos;s Bench Judgessfrom oneLord Chief Justice and 15 puisnesto one Lord Chief Justice and 17puisnes, so as to abrogate thenecessity for passing a resolutionupon the occurrence of vacanciesso long as the number is not increased above 18 in all:(b) to add. two additional Judges tothe King&apos;s Bench Division,&quot; applying to their appointments the procedure- at present applicable to the appoint-ment of the 17th and 18th Judge undersection 11 of the Act of 1925.&apos;Attached to the Memorandum were three Appendices,(i) giving an historical survey showing the number ofpuisne common law Judges now and in the past:    (it) eon-taining figures relating to the work of the King&apos;s: bench division in recent years:    and (ill) showing the work
done during the tenure of office of the national government by way of expediting&quot; and simplifyingthe procedure of the Supreme Court.After considerable discussion in the courseof which the Cabinet were fully informed a s to theneed for the appointment of the additional judges and the reasons for the arrears in the King&apos;s bench division, the Cabinet agreed:-(l) To approve the recommendations made bythe Lord Chancellor in Paragraph 37 of paper CP. 226 (34) as set out above.(2)    That this approval is subject to thecondition that when the Resolutionsnamed in (2) above are moved inParliament, it should be announced that the Lord Chancellor had decided to appoint a Committee to enquire into the serious arrears of business inthe King&apos;s Bench Division and to report as soon as practicable.(3)    To invite the Lord Chancellor to make proposals for the consideration of theCabinet covering the terms of reference and composition of the proposed Committee.(4)    To take note that under the LordChancellor&apos;s proposals as approved by theCabinet, the increase in the number of judges in the King&apos;s Bench Divisionfor which legislative sanction has to beobtained, is a temporary and not apermanent increase.

In accordance with the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had before them an InterimReport by the Cabinet Committee on the Reports ofthe Investigators into the Depressed Areas (C.P.-227(34)).    The Report stated that the briefest consider-ation of the Investigators&apos; Reports suggested that apolicy which was confined to those proposals in theReports which it was possible to accept and to carryout through the machinery of Government Departmentswas unlikely to satisfy the expectations that hadbeen created in all quarters by the appointment ofthe Investigators.   To meet this situation it seemednecessary to consider additional measures, and. withthis in view the Committee submitted the followingInterim recommendations to the Cabinet:-(l) That approval in principle should begiven to the proposal that the fourDepressed Areas should be treated asspecial fields for experiment and research, with a view to the initiation,organisation and prosecution of schemesdesigned to facilitate the economic development and social improvement ofthe areas .(2) That for the purposes of (1) above a, Commissioner responsible to the Ministerof Labour should be appointed with Agentsresident in each of the four areasrespectively.   The Commissioner to beentrusted with the powers necessary toenable him; to carry out the duties and functions briefly outlined in this Report.(.3) That on the reassembling of Parliament anannouncement should be made of the above proposals, emphasis being laid on theirnovel and experimental character. At thesame time it should be intimated, in general terms that effect will, be given to certain of the recommendations contained, in theReports of the Investigators in the depressed areas, but, as it is desirable that attention should not be diverted from the new scheme,references to detailed recommendations inthe Reports should, so far as possible, be avoided.(4) That, subject to the concurrence of theChancellor of the Exchequer in regard to finance, the proposals contained inPart II of the. Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee (C.P.-220 (34))on transference and training should be approved in principle.
10 0(5) That, subject to the consent and approvalof the Investigators, the four reports should be published, but that before publication the Investigators themselvesshould, delete&apos;from the Reports all inform-ation and other matters given to them in.confidence in the course of their enquiries.(6) That, prior to publication of the Reports,it should be announced that the Governmenthad consulted, the Investigators and had obtained their consent and. approval topxiblicat ion.(7)- To take note that the Committee are carefully examining the various points for decision set out in the Report ofthe Inter-Depart-mental Committee&apos;s Repor-t(C.P,-220 (34)), and that the committee epropose to submit a further Report to theCabinet when this examination is completed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer outlined to the Cabinetthe main features of the Report.,      In the course of thediscussion the suggestion was made that there should be incorporated in the framework of the proposals relating tothe Commissioner machinery for enabling close co-operation to be established between the well-to-do and the depressed areas.      Por example, the announcement of the scheme might include a carefully drawn appeal for the extension to other-areas of proposals on the lines of those contemplated in thecases of Surry and Jarrow.     Much might be done by an appealto voluntary effort, especially if that appeal was put on a personal and local basis. .   The whole system of transferencewould have been greatly facilitated had schemes of this kindbeen in operation when the transference policy was adopted.General agreement was expressed with the view that theenlistment of voluntary effort would fit in with the scheme proposed by the Cabinet Committee..    At the same time it was felt that it would be a mistake for the Government or theMinister of Labour themselves to make the suggested appeal for voluntary co-operation.     Such an appeal would comebetter f/rom the proposed Commissioner who, in making plans
t-b)(c)(d)etterment of the depressed areas, would he ablete to persons interested such as Sir John Jarvismoney could be best spent for the benefit of theCabinet agreed - 0To approve the interim recommendations ofthe Cabinet Committee contained in Paper No.CP. 227(34)  and summarised in this conclusion,subject to it being understood that, pending further consideration by the Committee, theCabinet reserved the question whether the&quot;specialised person who is to be entrusted withthe powers, duties and functions under thescheme should be a Commissioner responsible tothe Minister of Labour, or whether some other form of machinery might not be found preferable.That the question of the application of thescheme to Scotland should also be further considered.That, in answers to Parliamentary questions,a statement should be made to the effect thatthe Government have reached a decision on theReports of the Investigators but that it was felt that a matter of such importance couldnot adequately be dealt with by means of question and answer.     The Government proposed,therefore, to give a day for the discussion ofthe matter to be arranged through the usual-channels.That the necessary arrangements should be made so as to ensure that the Reports of theInvestigators (revised as contemplated in (o)of the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee)should be circulated to Parliament well inadvance of the date fixed for the Debate.

become much clearer than it was at present.      It was,however, important to proceed on the assumption thatthere would be very little (if any) Parliamentary time during the 1934-35 Session for legislation other thanthe Annual and Compulsory Bills and the Bills of major importance to which reference had been made at recentmeetings of the Cabinet.Attention was drawn to the fact that the PostOffice and Telegraph (Money) Bill must be passed into law before the Summer Recess 1935, and that that Billshould, therefore, appear in the List of Annual or compulsory Bills.      It was also suggested that twoAir Ministry Bills, namely, the Military Lands Acts(1892-1900)(Amendment) Bill and the Air Navigation Act(1920)(Amendment) Bill should be placed in List C ofH.A.C  18th Conclusions (34) as important Bills to beintroduced only if time permits.The Cabinet adopted the recommendation of theHome Affairs Committee set out above, subject to therectification of the lists in the case of the threeabove-mentioned Bills.
