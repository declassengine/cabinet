1.   With, reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsR  Irene e:       briefly reported to the Cabinet the most recent&apos;-&apos;:or.-       developments in the Egyptian situation.   The CabinetB - ion 3 )had, no doubt, observed from recent telegrams from.Cairo that Ahmed Ziwar Pasha had been appointed, asChef de Cabinet Royal by King fuad.    Siwar Pasha hadbeen called upon in the past to assist at moments ofcrisis, notably after the murder of Sir Lee Stack in1924.    He was a handy and accessible person, friendly to Great Britain, and while he might not be strong enough to control Tbrashi and the Court faction,   he might at all events be a channel of communication between King fuad and the Residency,   His appointmentmight be regarded, as a conciliatory gesture, especially if the rumour was true that the two objectionable&apos;members of the present Egyptian Cabinet were to be dismissed.   This development appeared, to justify theline which the Cabinet had recently decided, to adopt.In reply to questions, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs expressed the opinion that King Pu.ad&apos;scondition was much more serious than the medicalbulletins admitted.   While, no doubt, Mr Petersonhad at the outset been somewhat disturbed at theinstructions given him, as was shown in   his telegram no.283 of October 25th, he was now more satisfied,and, it need not be said, was loyally observing thoseinstructions.Attention was drawn to the statement in Mr Peter-son&apos; s telegram Ho. 288 of October 29th reporting aremark of Ziwar Pasha to the effect that &quot;in the last-resort the British Army was always there to quelldisorder&quot; .The view was expressed that it would be highlyembarrassing if we had to use British troops to-1-
support the present Palace regime. and that before thetroops were used we should insist on the dismissal ofIbrashi.   At the same time it was recognised that asthe situation developed it would require very delicatehandling, having regard, inter alia, to the fact thatwe have no constitutional rights in Egypt.The Cabinet took, note of this c oromun i c a. t ion.

The Cabinet were informed by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs that he proposed to seehe Disarmament   Mr Arthur Henderson and also Mr Norman Davis on theiOonfereno e.following day and that it seemed desirable to postponeK previous reference:f Cabinet 37(54)j Con-elusion 2.)the discussion in the Cabinet on the question of reduction and limitation of-Armaments until afterthese   meetings had. taken place.   While the ForeignOffice had not as yet received any official intimationon the subject, it had been stated by the B.B.C, thata Meeting of the Hureau of the Disarmament conference would probably be called for November 80th.The Prime Minister expressed the view that thequestion should, be fully examined, at the next Meetingof the Cabinet, and he hoped that any inter-Departmentaldifferences of view would be the.subject of examination by the Ministers concerned before the general question was discussed in Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  That the question of Reduction and limitation of Armaments should beplaced on the Agenda Paper for their next.Meeting.)

The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Private Manufactureof, and Trading in, Arms :-The Report of an Inter-DepartmentalCommittee under the Chairmanship ofthe Lord Privy Seal (CP .-235 (34)),covering a Draft Convention whichmight be suitable to be put forward,as a self-contained proposal forinternationa1 adoption, so framed as to follow as far as possible thelines of the draft Articles adopted at Geneva on July 2, 1.934, by theCommittee for the Regulation of theTrade in and Private and State Manu-facture of Arms and. Implements of War:A Report by the Ministerial Committeeon Disarmament (CP.-239 (34))  on theabove-mentioned Draft Convention,recording the following recommenda-tions:-(a) Ttiat the Committee were not preparedto recoilmend at the present moment that we should take the initiativeat Geneva by putting forward, theI nt e r-D e pa r t me nt a 1 0 omm it t e e * draft 0 onvention:&apos;   (h) That this recommendation might requirere-consideration as a result of theforthcoming Debate in the House o*&apos;0 ommons:(c) That as regards the line to be takenby the Government spokesman at theforthcoming Debate in the House ofCommons, the following points mightbe developed:-(i)(ii)That the abolition of private manufacture of arms and thesubstitution of State manufac-ture is, for reasons which mustbe fully developed, impracticableand would produce consequences onour security, fInanee and industrial organisation which cannot becontemplated;That consequently the practicalline is to regulate and controlexport with a view to preventingill effects and to framing amachinery which would, enable an embargo to be applied;(iii) That for this purpose international action is. needed;( iv) That the Geneva Draft convention was drawn up to form an integral part of the Disarmament convention and. that so much Importance was attached by the United Kingdom
t o arriving at a general agreement on disarmament that if such an agree-ment was reached we   should be preparedto accept the Geneva Draft:(v) That unfortunately the prospects of achieving any such general agreement on disarmament were not very hopeful,but nevertheless we still held, the conviction that it might be possibleto achieve some more limited, objective:(vi) That the mere examination of manufacture in a country itself would appear to haveno particular point without a general disarment Convention, but the exporttrade of the country was an entirely different matter and that it might be valuable to put forward, an appropriateproposal in this connection for thecontrol of the export trade of allcountries on the lines at presentpractised by its, and also to make provision for any embargo which itmight be desired to impose inter-nationally *(vii) That it would be desirable, in general,to refer to future action at Geneva inorder to meet the requirements ofexpectations which have been raised,such reference to be kept, however, in very general terms and the government not to be committed to any details:(viil) That there might be advantage inchallenging, the Opposition, if theypressed, for the abolition of private manufacture, as to where such a stepmight ultimately lead;(ix) That our condemnation of illicit trans-actions should be plain and definite,and it could be stated that the Governmenwould be prepared, to examine any definiteallegations within our juris diction:(x) That in illustration of the futility ofaction alone, our experiences with japan and China might be referred to.The Prime Minister informed, the Cabinet that theReport by the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament(CP.-259 (34)) had been prepared in great haste afterthe CommitteeTs Meeting on the previous evening.   Thepoints mentioned in recommendation (c) above were, ofcourse, not exhaustive, but merely indicated the moreimportant matters to be    stressed   in the forthcoming debate.
The Cabinet, considered the above recommendationsof the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament, andafter a full discussion adopted these recommendations,subject to the following amendments and alterations:-(a) That (c)(i) should be amended to read as follows:-That the abolition of private manu-facture of arms and the substitution of State manufacture is, for reasons which must be fully developed,impracticable and. would producepolitical consequences and alsoreactions in regard to our security,finance and industrial organisation which cannot be contemplated.(b) That the following sub-paragraph shouldbe inserted after paragraph (c)(i)-  Reference might also be made to thefact that the abolition of private manufacture of arms would place thosesmall countries which had no Statearsenals at a great disadvantage.Such countries would either have toprovide, at great expense, their ownState armament industries or becomedependent for their supplies of armsand munitions on other Powers.(c) That paragraphs (c)(iv) and (v) should.be combined and amended to read as follows(iv) That the Geneva draft articles were drawn up to form an integral part ofthe Disarmament Convention, but thatunfortunately the prospects of achievingany such general agreement on disarma-ment were not very hopeful&apos;   nevertheless we still held the&apos; conviction that itmight be possible to achieve some more1imited objective.(d) That for paragraph (c)(vi) should besubstituted the following(v) That international supervision was proposed as a check against breaches of a general Disarmament Convention,but that the supervision of manufacture in a country itself would lose much ofits force in the absence of such aConvention;    that the export trade ofthe country was, however, an entirely different matter;    and that we shouldfirmly declare that it was our Intentionto put forward and. to press for theadoption by all other nations of appro-priate proposals for the effective controlof the export trade of their respective countries on the lines at presentpractised by us, and. also for any embargowhich it might be desirable to imposeint, international 1. ona 1 ly .
(e) That a paragraph in the following terms,dealing with Export Credits, should beinserted after the new paragraph (c)(v):(vi) That in this connection emphasis-should be laid on our refusal, toapply Export Credits to armamentsales, and examples should be given of substantial orders which we had.lost by this restriction:    that we thought that our position was right:and that we should press in any convention for its general adoption.(f) That paragraph (c)(vii) of the original draft should be deleted.(g) That the concluding words of paragraph(c)(viii) should, read  &quot;as to the ultimate consequencesinvolved.1!(h) That the concluding words of   paragraph(c)(ix) should read  &quot;any definite allegations withinthe sphere of Government responsi-bility*.(For the text of the reeommendations ofthe Ministerial Committee... on Disarmamentas&quot;&apos;approyed^by the Cabinet see theAppendix to these Conclusions.)The Cabinet agreed  -(l) To adopt the recommendations containedin the Report of the Ministerial Oom-mittee on Disarmament (C.P.-S35 (34))as amended at the Meeting of the cabinet and, in particular, to approve as theline to be taken by the government spokesmen in the forthcoming Debate .in the House of Commons the developmentof the points summarised xi.ni.erparagraph (c)  of the Appendix to theseGoncius ions:(S) To leave to the Prime Minister thesettlement of the question of who shouldbe the Government spokesmen in the forthcoming Debate in the House of Commons,regard being had in this connection tothe discussion of the subject at theMeeting.
rfiTitt NAVAL 4, The Cabinet had before them a Report by theCONFERENCE,2935.. Committee on Preparations for the Naval Conference,Preliminary 1955 (C;,P:,-238 (34)), on the preliminary Naval dis-j) is cuss: ionswith Japanese erasions with the Japanese Representatives, at theRepresentatives.end of which the following general Conclusions were(previous set forth:-a e rA l. v.&apos; ... ----- -    -   -Cabinet 37 (1) The Japanese attach the utmost importance,(34), Con- as a matter of national prestige, to the elusion 5.) fixing of a common upper limitwhichentails the abolition of existing ratios,but they would see no objection to thei&apos;&quot;- ^ United Kingdom fixing this limit at- apoint higher than its present requirementsso as to give the British Empire some future latitude of movement.&apos;(2) Even if this upper limit were agreed to,Japan is not prepared in advance voluntarilyto limit her Navy to a percentage of thetotal of any other Navy;    nor is she pre-pared to discuss a building programme in which her navy would remain inferiorto that of another Power,   On the otherhand. Rear-Admiral Yamarnoto mentioned that Japan would not necessarily buildup to the upper- limit, though she mustretain the right to do so.(o) Tt will be seen that this does not neces-sarily exclude the possibility of Japanultimately accepting the idea of a&quot; G- e n 11 ema n&apos; s Ag r e erne ntM or &quot;V o lunta ryDeclaration11 in relation to future naval construction once the prestige point hasbeen disposed of to her satisfaction.(4) Japan also makes it a major point to securethe abolition of what are to her, though not to other differently situated Powers,o ffens ive vessels, viz., c a pit a1 s hips,aircraft-carriers and 8&quot; gun cruisers,but is evident 13/ not very hopeful thatthis will be possible.   Should it prove impossible,,, Japan would insist stronglyupon a reduction in the numbers of these vessels .   -She will adhere to the categorysystem in these types if their abolitioncannot be achieved, but stands for mergingall 6&quot; gun   cruisers and. destroyers intoa single category.    In the submarine-category Japan proposes the figure of120,6oo&apos; tons if capital ships are retained.(5) Japan&apos;s proposals in regard to qualitativelimitation appear to be close to our own,but it was only under some pressure thatshe was induced to discuss the technical questions so long as her demand for thecommon, upper limit was unsatisfied.    Sheshowed a disposition not to press too strongly her wish for global tonnagelimitation and accommodation seems possible on this matter.-B-
The 0 at- inet were informed that the dootsnentbefore them was the revised record of which&apos; a pre lira-inary draft had been handed round at the Meeting ofthe Cabinet mentioned in the margin.In reply to an enquiry as to the prospects of reaching a &quot;Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot; with Japan onthe lines indicated in Conclusion (3) above, theCabinet were informed that it would&apos; be difficult toexpress an opinion until after further discussionwith the United States Delegation.   That Delegationseemed to be much more reasonable and appreciativeof the realities of the situation than had been thecase in the summer.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had come to the conclusions-sion that Japan intended to denounce the washington treaty at the end of the year, and it also seemed tohim that the Japanese proposal for a &quot;common upper limit&quot; would, in the end, turn out to be quiteunacceptable both to the United Kingdom and. to theUnited States of America.   If this forecast provedcorrect we might find ourselves faced with theprospect of unrestricted naval construction and a renewed race in naval armaments.   The questiontherefore arose as to the possibility of avoidingthis calamity by means of a &quot;Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot;under which the principal Naval Powers would voluntar-lly limit their respective naval strengths .   In ordert&apos;o create an atmosphere suitable for such a voluntary agreement it would be necessary to make Japan realise the extreme gravity of her position in the event ofno agreement of any sort being arrived, at .   Moreover,we must lose no opportunity of reiterating to the americans    our contention that, whereas the UnitedKingdom required a strong Navy in view of her-9-
world-wide responsibilities, the commitments of theUnited States would justify a much smaller Navy thanthe United States now possessed, the conclusion being that the United States naval strength was based noton defence requirements but on prestige and a desire for parity with ourselves.The First Lord of the Admiralty informed theCabinet that if the Washington Treaty broke downand a race in naval armaments should be started,that race would either be in the number of vessels or in their size.    He hoped that we should, do every-thing possible to press both the Japanese and the americans for a reduction in the size of naval vessels,and added that it was his intention to circulate aMemorandum on the subject, to the Cabinet Committeeon the Naval Conference.General agreement was expressed with the viewsof the First Lord of the Admiralty in regard to thismatter,The Cabinet agreed  -To take note of the Report, of theCommittee on Preparations for theNaval Conference, 1935 (C.P.-SS8(34)) .

6.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (CP.-236 (34))on the subject of the Trade Negotiations with Germany,in which he recalled, that at the Meeting referred toin the margin it had been agreed that Sir frederick leith-Ross should be authorised, to proceed with his negotiations at Berlin for a Clearing Agreement basedon the &quot;Single Account system&quot;.   On the same day,however, the German representatives had put forwardan alternative proposal designed to avoid, the necessityof imposing any Clearing at all in connection withAnglo-German trade.   After briefly explaining this -alternative proposal, the Memorandum stated that theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard, of Trade had agreed, that in the circumstances it was one we should do well to adopt.   As the presentAnglo-German Exchange Agreement came to an end onOctober 31st it had been necessary to decide at oncewhat the United Kingdom attitude should, be, and therehad been no opportunity to consult the Cabinet.   Theyhad accordingly instructed Sir Frederick Leith-Rossto proceed on these lines ,   Attached to the Memorandum,was a copy of a letter from Sir Frederick to Dr. Schachtsetting out the conditions under which we were ready toaccept this arrangement, and of Dr. Schachfs acceptancesubject to agreement being reached on certain outstandingtechnical questions.   As soon as final agreement wasreached the necessary announcement could, be made inthe House of Commons, and the agreement could bepublished simultaneously in London and in Berlin.
Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve the action taken by theChancellor of the Exchequer and&apos;thePresident of the Board of Trade in authorising Sir Frederick Leith-Rossto conclude a Trade Agreement withGermany on the lines explained in paper CP. 236 (34) and the attachedcorrespondence.(b) To take note that as soon as a final agreement has been reached with theGermans, the necessary announcementwill be made in the House of commons and the Agreement will be publishedsimultaneously in London and Berlin.
7.    With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet were reminded by theSecretary of State for &quot;War that on the 34th October,1934,  ater consideration of the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, CP, 225 (34on the question of the Secession of the State of western Australia from the Commonwealth of Australia,the Cabinet had decided that on presentation of theWestern Australia petition by a Private Member inthe House of Commons, the Leader of that house should make a statement to the effect that in theopinion of the Government the question of thereceivability of the petition should be referred toa Select Committee of the House.Conclusion (3) of the Cabinet Minute on thesubject read that a statement to the same effect should be made by the Leader of the House of lords in that House, but he, the Secretary of State forWar, was satisfied that on that particular occasion the Cabinet had not decided that the question ofthe receivability of the petition should be referredto a Select Committee of the House of Lords, and he,therefore, proposed that Conclusion (3) should be deleted from the Cabinet Minute and certainconsequential amendments made affecting Conclusions(4) and (5).The Cabinet agreed -That the text of Cabinet 36 (34),Conclusion 8, should be amended on thelines suggested by the Secretary ofState for &quot;far.
Incitementfp disaffec-EON BILL.previousflference:cabinet 35 (34)inclusion 13).8.    The Secretary of State for War informed theCabinet that he understood that this Bill would notpass the House of Commons until Friday next.     a time-table for the Bill in the House of Lords had been devised on the assumption that the Bill would have passed the House of Commons on Fridayr-^tey-omber .2nA.Under this time-table it would have just beenpossible to get the Bill through the House of Lordsby November 16th,  the date of prorogation, on theassumption that guillotine machinery would have tobe used to overcome organised obstruction.      this time-table would not, however, enable the Bill toget through the House of Lords by November 16thif the Bill only reached that House on November 3rd.While he would take every possible step to securethe passage of the Bill into Law, he must warn theCabinet that a situation of some difficulty mighthave to be faced.The Cabine t took note of this communication.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,31st October, 1934.
Recommendations of the Ministerial Committee on Disarmamenton the Private Manufacture of Arms in the form approved bythe Cabinet at&apos;the Meeting on 51st October, 1954 fcabinet38(34), Conclusion 5.)(a) that the Committee were not prepared to recommend, atthe present moment that we should take the initiativeat Geneva by putting forward the interdepartmental committee&apos;s Draft Convention;(b) that this recommendation might require reconsiderationas a result of the forthcoming Debate in the House ofCommons;(c) that as regards the line to be taken by the government spokesman at the forthcoming Debate in the House ofCommons, the following points might be developed:-(i)    that the abolition of private manufactureof arms and the substitution of Statemanufacture is, for reasons which must be fully developed, impracticable and would produce political consequences and alsoreactions in regard to our security,finance and industrial organisation whichcannot be contemplated;reference might also be made to the factthat the abolition of private manufactureof arms would place those small countrieswhich had no State arsenals at a greatdisadvantage.      Such countries would eitherhave to provide, at great expense,  theirown State armament industries or becomedependent for their supplies of arms and munitions on other Powers;(ii)    that consequently the practical line isto regulate and control export with a viewto preventing ill effects and to framing a- machinery which would enable an embargo tobe applied;(iii)    that for this purpose international action is needed;(iv)    that the Geneva Draft Articles were drawnup to form an integral part of theDisarmament Convention but that unfortunately the prospects of achieving any such generalagreement on disarmament were not very hopeful,nevertheless we still held the conviction thatit might be possible to achieve some more limited objective;(v)    that international supervision was proposed as a check against breaches of a general disarment Convention, but that the super-vision of manufacture in a country itself would lose much of its force in the absenceof such a Convention:    that the export trade of the country was, however, an entirelyAPPENDIX.
different matter;    and that we should firmly declare that it was our intention to put forward and topress for the adoption by all other nations of appropriate proposals for the effective control ofthe export trade of their respective countries onthe lines at present practised by us, and also forany embargo which it might be desirable to imposeinternationally;(vi) that in this connection emphasis should be laid onour refusal to apply Export Credits to armamentsales, and examples should be given of substantialorders which we had lost by this restriction;that we thought that our position was right;    andthat we should press in any Convention for its general adoption;(vii)  that there might be advantage in challenging theOpposition,  if they pressed for the abolition ofprivate manufacture, as to the ultimate consequencesinvolved;(viii) that our condemnation of illicit transactions shouldbe plain and definite, and it could be stated thatthe Government would be prepared to examine any definite allegations within the sphere of Governmentresponsibility;(ix) that in illustration of the futility of action.alone, our experiences with Japan and China mightbe referred to.
