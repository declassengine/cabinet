GERMAN RB-fPreviousRef ereno e:Cabinet 48(54), Con-clusion So)1. With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs raised as a matter of urgency the questionwhether, in the Debate that afternoon, the government spokesmen should state that we believed that the totalnumber of aircraft of Service types possessed, byGermany was about 1,000.    In this connection attention was drawn to telegram No, 296 from. Sir E. Phipps,dated. November 27th, containing an account of his interview that day with Baron von Neurath, in whichthe German Foreign Minister had. declared that thefigure of 1,.0C0 military aircraft was greatlyexaggerated and. that he would be obliged to issue acontradiction if that figure were quoted publicly.The Secretary of State also drew the attention of theCabinet to telegram No. 301, of November 27th, fromthe Air Attache at Berlin, in which he urged, most strongly that an exaggerated figure for german aircraft should, be most carefully avoided by theGovernment in the House of Commons, as the effect would perhaps be to encourage Germany to build up toan exaggerated, figure.    In his (the Air Attache&apos;s)opinion the number of Service aircraft in Germanydid not exceed 600 today.The Cabinet were informed, that the statemen tregarding the 1,000 German military aircraft was contained in Appendix I to CP.-265 (34), and. thatthis statement had been most carefully checked both for the Committee of Imperial Defence and. for theCabinet Committee on   German Re-armament._General agreement was expressed with the view^thatit would be unwise to state any figure in the House ofCommons which could, be successfully challenged, byGermany.   On the other hand, the importance of mention--ing some figure was emphasised, and it was recognised
that, while an exaggerated figure must he avoided,care must also he taken not to under-estimate.In the course of discussion the Lord Presidentof the Council indicated that he proposed to dealwith the matter in a way which would avoid the mention of any precise figure.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs proposedto inform Sir Eric Phipps,  beforethe Debate,  of the nature of theLord President&apos;s proposed statement,in order that the German government might know in advance that carefulconsideration had&quot; been given toBaron von Keurath1s contention:(h) To take note that the Lord Presidentof the Council and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs would confer on the question of what should be said in the Lord PresidentVs speech in the debate regarding the communication madeboth in London and Berlin to germany on the subject of her re-armament.
AUSTRIA .8.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theP inaneialposition of,(previous reference:Cabinet 33(54), Con-elusion 1.)Cabinet that he had seen the Austrian Finance Minister,who had. come to thank His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe warmest possible terms for the action the;/ hadtaken in giving their support and facilitating inother ways the recent conversion of the AustrianLoan.    The Austrian Minister in London had expressedthe opinion that the British Government had taken asmuch care and trouble in regard to this Austrianconversion operation as if it had been concerned, with one of their own Loans, and he had contrasted ouractivities in this respect with those of the FrenchGovernment, very much to the disadvantage of thelatter. -The Cabinet took note of this c ommunication,
vPrt sAAR. 3.    With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum.previous reference: by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (G.P.-275Cabinet 41(34)   Con- (34)), further relative to the question of the main-elusion 1.)tenance of order in the Saar during the plebisciteand in the succeeding interval.   While in Geneva theLord Privy Seal had interviewed M. Laval and Mr Knox,arid, accounts of the conversations were set out in annexes T and II to CP.-275 (34).   The questioncalling for immediate decision was the reply to bemade to M.- Laval when, upon the reassembly of theCouncil of the League next week, he, as he is almost certain to do, asks the British Representative -(a) Whether, if and when the French send,police (or troops) into the Saar at mr Knox&apos;a request, His Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment in the United Kingdom willsend, a contingent to co-operate withthe French force in the Saar:    and(b) In the event of a negative reply to question (a), what attitude the&apos;british representative at the Council will,assume to a proposal (which apparentlywill now be made by France) that theFrench Government should be given aspecial ad hoc mandate by the Councilto intervene in the Saar in an emergency,instead of being bound, as at present,by the out-of-date Resolution of 1926.The Secretary of State ther -set forth in his Memorandumfour possible answers that could be made to the abovequ.es t ions , via ,: -(a) That His Majesty11 s Government are notprepared, to send a contingent to co-operate with the force which the Frenchmight send into the Saar, or to agreeeven to token co-operation by theattachment of, say, a single officer.(b) That our Representative at Geneva will support a proposal that the council should give France a special ad,, hocmandate for French forces to intervene in an emergency if summoned by Mr Knox.(c) That K. Laval should be urged not to askfor an immediate decision by the Councilto confer a mandate tipon France, but to wait until the emergency arose, when hecould be assured that such a mandatewould, in fact, be given.
(d) That we recognise the disadvantages,and indeed the impropriety, of inter-vention in the Saar by Prance, whichis directly interested in the plebisciteresult:    and that therefore, subjectto the approval of the Council and similar action by Italy, the othergreat disinterested European Power,we will supply one-half of the 2,000soldiers stated to be necessary byMr Knox;    this force will be immediatelydespatched to the Saar, where it willremain throughout the plebiscite and theperiod, by which it will necessarily befollowed before the decision of theLeague of Nations is declared.In the course of considerable discussion theobjections to each of the four courses named above were stated.     At the same time, there was strong support for the view that if the Council of the Leagueof Nations passed a resolution to the effect that aninternational force should be sent to the Saar, itwould be very difficult for Great Britain to refuseto co-operate in furnishing a British contingent tosuch a force.        In this respect, the position would bemade much easier for us if Germany were to declare herinacquiescence/the terms of the resolution of the Councilof the League.
The Secretary of State for War informed theCabinet that his military advisers were strongly opposed to the French suggestion that we should send a &quot;token&quot; contribution.    On the receipt of CP.-275(34) he, the Secretary of State, had received furthercounsel from his military advisers, who consideredthat the supply of a contingent to co-operate withthe French, or an ad, hoc mandate to the French, wouldnot meet the situation.    In the view of his military advisers there were certain definite conditions whichshould govern our acceptance of any responsibility inthis matter:-(a) Any contingent sent should take overthe maintenance of peace in ampletime before the plebiscite starts:(b) The strength of any contingent mustbe adequate, not less than a brigade of four battalions (of approximately450 to 500 each), together with certainancillary troops - say 2,000 men in all:(c) The Commander of this force must beresponsible solely to Mr Knox for such part of the Saar area as he allots to it.Finally, his military advisers assumed that before any contingent was sent the consent of the powers concerned, particularly France and Germany, wouldbe obtained,   ^his, in their view, was essential.The view was expressed that public opinion at homewould be opposed to the sending to the Saar of theforce mentioned in (d)  of CP,-275 (34), and also of a force of the size contemplated by the War Office.   we ought, not to participate in any scheme except on abona fide international basis covering countries suchas Italy, Holland, Scandinavia, and, if possible,Switzerland and. others .The suggestion.was made that at the meetingof the Council of the League next week the british representative should outline to the Council thevery difficult and dangerous position in the Saar,should, state to the Council that, in our -opinion,the4 bftst course would be to send to the Saar a-6 and  7 -
bona fide international force, and. that if aresolution to this effect were adopted by the Council,we should be prepared to contribute a Britishcontingent.This suggestion met with considerable support,though certain members of the Cabinet indicated thattheir acceptance of it was subject to the limitingof the British contingent to a unit of the order of a battalion.        On the other hand, doubts were felt as to the division of command which the War Officeconditions appeared to contemplate, and it wassuggested that it would be necessary to find somesolution which would in effect ensure unity of command of the international force.The Secretary of State for War warned the Cabinetthat before taking any decision in the matter, many important questions should be answered, for example,who was to be responsible for paying and provisioningthe international force, what arrangements would bemade regarding its communications and its command.He thought that we ought to have much more precise information than we possessed at present as to where we were going.After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed:(a) Provisionally to adopt the suggestionthat at the meeting of the Council ofthe League next week, the british representative should outline the difficult and dangerous position in the Saar andshould indicate our view that the best course would be to send to the Saar abona fide international force.(b) That this international force shouldbe on the lines of similar forcesemployed in the Silesian plebiscite andon other similar occasions, e.g. anumber of countries (other than france and  Germany) should each contribute to ita military unit of the order of a battalion.
(c) That the Secretary of State for Warand the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in consultation should prepare a scheme to give effect to the above proposal.(d) That the Foreign Office should givethe War Office a full appreciation ofthe political aspects of the matter,and that the War Office should adviseas to how best effect could be givento the proposal.(e) That theSecretary of State for Warand the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should report later in theweek to the Prime Minister,  the lord president of the Council, and theChancellor of the Exchequer.

PRIVATEMANUFACTUREOF AND trading in ARMS.The proposed inquiry.(previous reference;Cabinet41 (34) Con-elusion 6 (d)7. With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the attention of the Cabinet was drawn by the Lord Chancellor to the following considerations relative to the suggestion that theCommission of Inquiry should, if practicable, bepresided over by a distinguished Member of theJudicial Bench:1.     It is not possible, in view of the verycongested state of judicial business, to spare a Judge, either from the House ofLords or from the Supreme Court.2,     Important as it is, however, that thejudicial machine should he kept in efficientoperation, it is still more important thatthe Judges should he, so far as practicable,detached from political questions.     Thematter with which the Inquiry will he con-cerned arouses political feelings in a very high degree.     Whatever conclusion theCommission may reach, and whether theydetermine to report in public or in private,they and their proceedings will be thesubject of fierce political controversy.In view of these considerations the LordChancellor invited the Cabinet to reconsider theConclusion in question and to adopt his considered jview that the proposal that the Inquiry should, if Ipracticable, be presided over by a distinguishedMember of the Judicial Bench was not one whichin the circumstances could be entertained.
In the course of a brief discussion the view was expressed, that this particular matter was of outstanding Importance and that unless the Chairmanof the Commission of Inquiry was a trained and experienced lawyer the public interest might be   mostgr ave ly pr e jud ic e d .The Cabinet agreed.  mo defer further consideration ofthe question until their next regularMeeting on Wednesday, December -5th,and to request the Lord chancellor to circulate a Memorandum on thesubject in the interval.
DESTINE.proposed&quot; gialative0uric il.previous reference:Cabinet 14(34), Con-elusion 5.)So The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the proposed Palestine Leg is la-tive Council:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (CP.-255(34)), attaching a copy of a Despatchhe proposed to send, to the HighCommissioner, on which the latter would base his discussions withArabs and.

(DIPLOMATIC 9. The Cabinet had before them a w0te bv *.he[consularSS. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-243 (34) )ofcovering the Report of a Committee appointed earlythis year to review the question of the admission ofwomen to the Diplomatic and Consular Services.   Whilethe Committee had agreed, with two exceptions, that itwould be inadvisable to admit women to the Cons tilerService at- the present time, four members of theCommittee had held that the arguments against the admission of women to the Diplomatic Service definitelyoutweighed those in favour, and these four membersaccordingly recommended no change in the existing position.   Two members held a. contrary view and recommended that women should be eligible for admission to the Diplomatic Service on the same terms as men.The two remaining members of the Committee were Infavour of admitting women to the Diplomatic service for a limited period as an experimental measure.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Report of the Committee onthe Admission of Women to the diplomatic and Consular services should be published:(b) That when the Report was publishedit should be accompanied by a statement that the Government accepted theconclusions of the majority in regardto the Diplomatic Service, namely,that the arguments against the admis-sion of women to that Service definitelyoutweigh those in favour, and have accordingly decided to make no changein the existing position:   and also theconclusions of the majority in regardto the Consular Service, namely, thatit would be inadvisable to admit women to this Service:    the statement inquestion to set out the Government&apos;sreasons for these conclusions:(c) To request the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to prepare and circulate to the Cabinet for consideration thedraft of the statement to accompany the Report of the Committee whenpublished.

SPEAKER&apos;S 11.The Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-T&apos; randum by the Prime Minister (CP.-266 (34)) onthe subject of the Speaker&apos;s Seat.   Hitherto- the90$*- Speaker had been left in possession of his seatwithout a contest at elections, but the Labour party had now decided to oppose the present Speaker when an election comes.    In his Memorandum the Prime Ministerrecommended that, in order to maintain the independ-ence of the Speaker so soon as he is elected to his office and. so long as it is the wish of the House ofCommons to retain him in that office, and to give theSpeakership a place and a dignity specially marked, outin the Constitution of Parliament, to which it was fully entitled, legislation should be prepared toprovide fchat -(a) The Speaker of the House of Commonsshall occupy a position all by himself and be simply the speaker of the House whilst retaining thestatus and privileges now enjoyed by him as Speaker:&quot;(b) He will vacate his seat on election to the Speakership and a by-electionwill in consequence follow to fill the vacancy:(c) On dissolution of a Parliament he willcontinue to fulfil the duties whichthe Speaker now performs on that event.After some discussion, in which certain objectionsto the proposals outlined in CP.-266 (34) wereindicated and alternative suggestions for meetingthe difficulty were made, the Cabinet agreed  To invite the Prime Minister to-conferfurther with the Speaker of theHouse of Commons in regard, to thematter.

Having secured the concurrence of the Lord President of the Counciland, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the acceptanceof the scheme, the President of the Board of Tradesummarised as follows the points on which a decision was required.:-(i) The introduction of the draft Billto grant a subsidy of not more than 2 millions for one year to ships carrying tramp cargoes in accordancewith the scheme submitted by the ship-owners and to give legislative sanction to the concession as to Pees paid bythe Shipping industry:(ii) Whether a scrapping and building scheme on the principles indicated in the draftBill (with the modifications shown inparagraph 9 of CP.-269 (34) with a viewto making the scheme more attractive)and in the White Paper of July last(Cmd. 4647), should be included inthe Bill.The Cabinet were informed by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer that certain alterations had been madein regard, to the subsidy provisions of Part II ofthe Bill, to which, on the information before him,he saw no reason to raise objection.   In view, however.of the fact that under Clause S of the Bill themaximum amount of the loans was fixed at  10,000,000,he saw no necessity for including in the Billprovisions for the guarantee of loans as well asprovisions for direct advances.   He therefore-20-
suggested that both the Bill and the White Paper shouldhe shortened by omitting the references to guarantees.The President of the &quot;Board of Trade accepted thissuggestion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and theCabinet agreed  That the President of the Board of trade should be authorised to introduce theBritish Shipping (Assistance) Bill inthe House of Commons, subject to the deletion of references to guaranteesin Part IT of the Bill, and subject also to the examination of the Billin detail by the Committee of HomeAffairs, but without further referencet o the 0abinet.

The Memorandumstated that within the last three years certain Countyt(3&amp;)f/*      Councils had obtained from Parliament Private Actsgiving power, inter.....alia, to check the abuse of&quot;ribbon&quot; development,    strong demands were being madeby the County Councils Association and other bodiesthat other County Councils should be granted likepowers, without each one of them being put to theexpense attendant upon Private Sill legislation.A Bill for this purpose would be a relatively short and simple matter and should not meet with strong opposition in Parliament.-   On the other hand, such aBill would fall short of a complete remedy.   the ministries of Health and Transport, therefore, hadelaborated proposals for more comprehensive anddrastic measures, to enable County Councils, withoutliability to pay compensation, to impose on frontagerson the principal roads a degree of control which,though less severe than that secured by the PrivateActs, would mitigate the worst evils of &quot;ribbon&quot;development.    The two Ministers asked the Cabinet toauthorise the preparation - of a Bill on the wider lines on the understanding that the question whether the wider or narrower Bill should be introduced would bereferred, to them again.The suggestion was made that if the proposed Billcontained provisions for the payment of compensation,.. the advisability of including provisions for paymentof &quot;betterment&quot; by landowners of frontages on mainthoroughfares shotild be considered.-26-
