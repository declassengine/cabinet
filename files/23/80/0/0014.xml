1.   The Secretary of State for War informed theCabinet that the arrangements for the despatch of aBritish contingent to the Saar had been published: inthe Press&apos;that day.   The Commander of the Inter-national Force in the Saar would be Maj^or-general.E.S. Brind, C .B,,C .M.G .,B,Sn0 ., recently deputy chief of the General Staff in India and at presentin command of the 4th Division at Colchester.   GeneralBrind had. served In Italy during the Great War andhad represented India at meetings at Geneva on disarmament, etc .   The main port ion of the force would consist of battalions of the East lancashire and Essex Regiments and would be commanded, by BrigadieJ.H.T. Priest-man, D.S.0,,M.0,    The details were nowbeing settled, and no hitch or trouble of any kindwas anticipated.The Cabinet took note of this c cmmun ic at 1on.
RE- 2, The Cabinet were informed that at the Meetingr&apos; of the Cabinet Committee on German Re-armament ondigestedtiestion and the previous evening the Committee had. been told.?r inparliament. that Germany was treating the recent Debate in theHouse of Commons as tantamount to a legalisation of/previous reference: their re-armament and exploiting for their ownCabinet 43(34), Gon-^ purposes statements which had been made in the elusion 1.)Debate by the Lord President of the Council and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    In orderto prevent such exploitation it was suggested, thatthe position should be cleared up by means of thefollowing Question and Answer:-To ask the Prime Minister whether,by the statements of the Lord Presidentof the Council and, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs in the house on November 28th, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment intended to imply thatthey do not consider the DisarmamentClauses of Part V of the Treaty ofVersailles any longer binding upon germany .Draft,, Answer.No, Sir, there was no such implications-tion.   H..M. Government do not recognise the right of any signatory to a treaty to free itself from obligations imposedupon it without negotiation and agree-ment with the other signatories...It was pointed out, however, that, while the proposedAnswer might be satisfactory so far as Germany-was concerned, it would, if the Cabinet approved theproposals in the Report circtilated to them on theprevious evening (CB.-295 (34)), considerablyembarrass us in the forthcoming discussions withthe French.Ministers, and it was generally agreedthat, while it would be undesirable that a statementof. this kind should be made in Parliament before   theConference with M, Flandin and his colleagues, itwould be advantageous if the substance of the Answercould be communicated forthwith to the GermanGovernment by His Majesty fs&apos; Ambassador in Berlin.
Cabinet agreed --To request the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to inform HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlinforthwith of the substance of theproposed Question and Answer and to instruct him to convey the Answer tothe German Government with as little delay as possible.
3.    The Cabinet had before them a Report by theCabinet Committee on German Re-armament (CP.  295(34)), resulting from a Meeting of the committee held on the previous evening to consider whatrecommendations could be made to the Cabinet as  tothe next step to be taken in respect of the questionof German Re-armament.      The Committee felt it to beof the utmost importance that a decision should betaken on this fundamental question of policy, andthat the action proposed to be taken should be thebasis of the position we should take up in our comingconversations with the French.        The recommendationsput forward to the Cabinet were as follows:-(a).-That an approach should be made to&quot;France at the earliest possible moment.This approach should take the form of.....^    an invitation to M.  Flandin to visitthis country and to hold discussions with us.(b) That we should not, at the present stage,have any detailed discussions with theItalians,  though the Italian Governmentshould be informed of our invitation toM. Flandin and the general tenor of thematters which it is proposed to discuss.Great importance is, however, attachedultimately to agreement between France,Italy and the United Kingdom in dealingwith this question.(c) That in the discussions with M. Flandinthe actual method of approach must beelastic and the sequence in which thevarious matters are developed can best be decided in the light of circumstancesat the time.(The recommendations then set forth theten points considered by the committee to be of first importance in thenegotiations referred to above.)The Committee realised that there was always a risk that Germany might free herself from therestrictions of Part V of the Treaty of Versaillesand that no bargaining with her might be possible,and, in consequence, no general agreement.      Such a situation would be very serious, but there did notappear to be any alternative.      If the situation was-4-
just left to drift, Germany would, continue to re-armto- whatever degree she might ultimately desire.Attached, to the Report was a copy of a Note bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (G.R,(S4) 3),which had formed the basis of the Committee&apos;s presentconsiderations.The Prime Minister explained the reasons whythe Cabinet Committee had decided to recommend the Cabinet to take immediate action on the lines indicated in the Report.      The circumstances were wholly exceptional and the case must not be regardedas a precedent.      He regretted that it had not beenpossible to give the members of the Cabinet more time to consider the very important issues involved.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained the Committee&apos;s recommendations and theten points set out in paragraph 2 of the Report.In the course of this explanation the followingalteration was made in the text:    (For the ten pointsas so altered, see Appendix).Page 2 (ii) to be amended to read:&quot;It is considered that the situation vis a visGermany must be taken as it is to-day, bearing that mind that the return of Germany to theLeague and to the Disarmament Conference isessential for the establishment andmaintenance of peace in Europe&quot;.In the course of his explanatory statement theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew special attention to point (vi).       He was deeply concerned to ascertain what Germany would insist upon as a .condition for her return to Geneva and theDisarmament Conference.      If she could be got backon the basis of the status quo this course would be satisfactory, but he feared that she would insist on
0Tl i sa^ uuuu* \I Liu ifjfcu $faftatiUu0 ttu litalZj,1full equality of rights and freedom of action,and that she would not return to Geneva unless this was promised her in advance.In regard to point (viii), the Secretary ofState explained that it was only proposed to replace the Armament Provisions of Part V of the treaty and that it was not proposed to touch the provisions dealing with the Demilitarised Zones.        This had always &quot;been our position and had been madeperfectly clear to Germany in the past.In the course of considerable discussion thefollowing among other considerations were advanced:(l)    It seemed probable that Germany willinsist on complete equality of rights as a condition of returning to Geneva.He must be prepared in advance for thisquestion and for our answer to it.The suggestion was made that if thisquestion was put to us by the French weshould give our reasons why in our view it would be best to answer it in the affirmations-tive provided it was clear Germany could^      not be got back to Geneva in any other way.As regards the measure of our own security.To some extent the figures mentioned in the debate in the House of Commons constituted a menace to our security, but we must beprepared to answer the question at whatprecise point in the re-armament of germany should a halt be called, because thatre-armament constituted a menace to ourselves or a menace to the peace ofEurope.(3) Assuming a Disarmament Convention towhich Germany was a party, can Germanybe trusted to observe the Convention?A large part of Europe would answer inthe negative.        This leads to thequestion of collective security, and this issue may arise in the near future inregard to the Pacific.        It may indeed
become a great world question ah(! onewhich, according to our success or failure in dealing with it, may havea deciding influence on the politicalfortunes of the Government.(4) It would be necessary at some stage to speak in very friendly terms, but very plainly, to Germany, and to tellher that if she insisted on continuing to re-arm in the face of world opinionwe must regard her as the common enemy of European peace and take steps todeal with that situation.   Vis-a-visPrance the steps in question wouldhave to be based on a scheme of security,which need not amount to more than ourbuilding up for our own. defence, whichmight well give Prance an increasingsense of confidence:    and. this aspect of the matter would require the most careful, examination in advance of any decision.(5)  It was improbable that we should be ableto persuade Prance to define &quot;equalityin a regime of security&apos;&apos;.   Completesecurity could, of course, be achieved if the other Powers possessed forcesstrong enough to deal with Germany:    but,short of this, there were other expedients:for example, Germany might be pressed toenter into an Pastern Locarno, and ourown efforts to strengthen our military-position would enable us in future togive effective help, if necessary, toour allies .(6) It is desirable to give the forthcomingFrench visit publicity.   The strongerwe make the common front between ourselves, France and Italy, the more likely it is that Germany will listen to reason.    She is frightened at theidea of being isolated.Some doubt was expressed whether, even in the last.resort, we should contemplate giving Germany fullequality of rights as a condition of her return to geneva.    If we did so and Germany proved unreasonablein the negotiation of the Disarmament Convention andrefused to agree to such a Convention, she would have obtained with consent her freedom to do what she liked.It should be remembered that we have no power underthe Treaty to release Germany from any of the provisionsof the Treaty by ourselves.   Such release would haveto be agreed to by all the parties to the Treaty.
Q v QIt seemed probable that while, in thefirst place, Germany would ask for full equality of rights, she would, in the end, take much less.   Shewas becoming conscious that she had much to gain byreturning to Geneva, and she would hesitate beforerejecting proposals on which the United Kingdom,Prance and Italy were agreed.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to point(x), and it was agreed that so far as this was concerned the intention was not to go beyond whatthe Cabinet had already accepted, namely:-&quot;(b) That in regard to the Disarmamentposition, his attitude should, beas followss     56     k     *     H(3) If it were found, possible to adjust the differences, andif the only barrier to aconvention were on the questionof supervision, the BritishGovernment would not regard this as necessarily consti-tuting an insuperable obstacle,but would consider the proposal with an anxious desire of finding a means of supervision acceptable to all.&quot;(Cabinet 51 (38). Conclusion 3(b) (a).)After further discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) wo approve the recommendations (a),(b) and (c) in paragraph 3 ofC.P.-395 (34) as set out at thebeginning of this Conclusion, and accordingly to authorise theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs to invite M. Flandin andhis colleagues to visit this countryfor &quot;the purpose of the proposed,conversations as soon as the visitcan he arranged:(b) That the general lines and scope ofthe conversations should be as setout in points (i) to (x) of theAppendix to these Conclusions:
(o) To request the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to informS, Mussolini of the action whichit was proposed to take:(6) That as regards Inspection (point (x))the intention was not to go beyondthe Conclusion of the Cabinet onSeptember 20, 1933 (Cabinet 51(33), Conclusion 2 (b)(2)), quoted above.

The Cabinet were informed that the discussions with the Japanese and the Americans were continuing.There had as yet been no definite reply fromMre Matsudaira on the subject of the postponementby Japan of her notice to terminate the washington treaty, but there was good reason to believethat this notice would be deferred until the endof the month.The technical discussions were proceedingfavourably,  and certain proposals had been referred by the Japanese Delegation to Tokyo,The Cabinet took note of this communication.I-
-AVY ESTIMATES.5.The Cabinet had before them the followingijgw CONSTRUCTION documents on the subject of Navy Estimates and thePROGRAMME PGRjq35. Programme    of New Construction for 19.55:-(previous cabinet 4-5(34) . Con-conclusion 5.)A Joint Memorandum bythe Exchequer and thethe Chancellor off first Lord of theAdmiralty (CP,-291 (34))  dealing withthe Navy Estimates, 19 35, which includedprovision for making good. Naval defioien-cies in that year.    At the request of theChancellor, the First Lord had. agreed toreduce by  750,000 the total Estimate whichhe had originally proposed for 1935.Part of this reduction, namely,  250,000had been effected on the understanding,proposed by the Chancellor, .that if duringthe course of the financial year it became evident that the increase in the overhead,cut had not been justified by the progressof the work on the approved programme, theChancellor would agree to a supplementary estimate being presented to make good! thedifference.Es tima t e agreed*?he revised, totalbetween the First lord and the Chancellor amounted to^60.050,000,A Memorandum by the Firs t Lord of theAdmiralty ^ CP.-289 (34);  on the Programmeof New Construction for 1935, asking cabinet approval for the inclusion in the navy estimates for 1935 of the following ships:-3131417Cruisers (MINOTAUR type).Leader and 8 Destroyers.Submarines (One Minelayer Submarine,one &quot;P&quot; or General Servicetype, one &quot;S&quot; or Patrol type) .Submarine Depot Ship.Sloops (three Minesweeping Sloops andone Convoy Sloop).Survey ing Sh ip.Small&quot; Vessels (namely, two Coastal Sloops,one small Minelayer,two Gate Vessels andtwo ^rawlers).Appended to the Memorandum was a financialstatement showing the total estimated costof the Programme and the probable spread of the expenditure over the financial yearsaffected.The Cabinet were informed by the First Lordof the Admiralty that the Navy Estimates for 1934/35showed an increase of about  3,500,000 on theEstimates for 1933/34.      The greater part of this increase was &quot;automatic11 and, therefore, beyond his control.        It had only been possible for him to
&apos;l I. 1  ill   i i! ; &apos;l l: &apos;i3 327meet the views of the Chancellor of the exchequer by reducing the amount required for &quot;deficienciesu.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew theattention of the Cabinet to the rapid rise which was taking place in the cost of iiew construction.      Thefigure for the current year was  10,717,000, in 1935the estimate would be  11,500,000, and in 1936 14,250,000.        In 1936 the political and financial difficulties might become very formidable and veryserious consideration would then have to be givento the Navy Estimates.The Pirst Lord of the Admiralty observed thatthe programme in CP, 272 (34) was the ordinary annualreplacement programme.      The commitments in 1936and subsequent years would depend on the discussionsnow taking place with the Americans and the Japanese.The Prime Minister observed that this was a very important question raising political considerations of first-class importance and enquired whether itmight not be desirable for the whole question ofNaval expenditure to form the subject, matter fordiscussion at a special meeting of the Cabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that sofar as he was concerned, he did not ask for aspecial Cabinet meeting on the subject.      He couldnot say that the programme submitted by the Pirst Lordof the Admiralty was unjustifiable.      Indeed, ifthe financial position of the country had been betterthere would, in his view, have been no justification for asking the Admiralty to make the reductions whichthey had agreed to make on the present occasion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer enquired,however, whether it would be possible for the defence requirements Committee to prepare a redraft of their
Report for publication.    In his view it was very desirable that the true position should be brought home to the public by giving as much of the fasts as could safely be disclosed.The view was expressed that.before any suchrevised Report was published, the dangers of disclosinginformation would have to be weighed against theadvantages of educating public opinion.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Programme for NewNaval Construction for 1935 submitted in C.P.-S89 (34) as summarised above:(b) To take note that the Prime minister proposed to confer with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, after the return ofSir Maurice Hankey, in regard to thesuggestion that a revised version ofthe Report of the Defence requirements committee should be prepared with aview to its possible publication.
m$F. PRIVATE 5    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byMANUFACTUREJt?   AND TRADING- the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (0 .P.-292tn&apos; arms.  (34)), furnished in accordance with a request madeCommittee of inquiry. at the Meeting held, on November 21st (Cabinet 41 (34),Conclusion 6), making some suggestions as    to theCommittee of Inquiry into the Private Manufacture of,.and. Trading in, Arms,   The Terms of Reference putforward, by the Secretary of State for considerationwere as follows:-(1) To consider and report upon the practi-ability and. desirability (both from thenational and. international point of view)of the adoption (a) by the United Kingdomalone, (b) by the United Kingdom in con-junction with the other countries of theworld, of a prohibition of private manu-facture of and trade in arms and munitions of war, and the institution of a statemonopoly of such manufacture and trade.(2) To consider and. report whether, assuming that private manufacture and trade continue,there are any steps ^hich eould usefully be taken to minimize the grave objectionsto which such manufacture is stated inArticle 8 (5) of the Covenant of the Leagueof Nations to be open:    [for this purpose,the existence of possible abuses is assumed,and. it will not therefore be within theterms of reference to investigate particularallegations J .(3) To examine the present arrangements in forcein the United. Kingdom relative to the controlof the export trade in arms and. munitions ofwar, and to report (a) whether these arrange-ments require revision, and, if so, in whatdirections:    (b) on the extent to which thegeneral adoption by other countries of similar arrangements might be expected, to eliminate or reduce the objections referredto in paragraph (2).The passage in&apos;square brackets at the end of (2) would,he thought, make    it certain that the Inquiry did notturn itself into a roving commission:    it might perhaps be considered safe to leave the Chairman to rule that it followed from the earlier part of the paragraph that no such roving inquiry was within theterms of reference;    but there was a risk.   TheSecretary of State saw great difficulty in nominatingf previous reference:Cabinet 45(34), Con-elusion 6.)
anything less elaborate than a Royal Commission, andLord LondonderryTs suggestion of the Right Hon. JamesAndrews, Lord Justice of Appeal for Northern Irelandsince 1921, as Chairman, seemed the best.   TheMemorandum continued that the object ought to be tosecure a small body of people who were reallyimpartial and uncommitted, and. mentioned, a few nameswhich had occurred to the Secretary of State.In the course of discussion the view was expressed that it would be desirable to defer any announcement on the subject in order to give ample time for very careful consideration of the terms of reference and for securing the services of the most suitable persons to act as Chairman and members of the proposedRoyal Commission.    So important a matter should notbe rushed, and there was not so much pressxxre for anearly announcement as there had been ten days ago.On the other hand it was urged, that further delay would be criticised, and it was suggested, that itshould be announced, immediately before the Recess,that the Government had decided to appoint a RoyalCommission, the composition and terms of reference of which would be published in the New Year.    serious objections were raised to this proposal:    e.g., theGovernment would be pressed, by various interests for representation on the Commission, and with suggestionsregarding the terms of reference.    On these groundsit was urged that the whole scheme should be announced at one and the same time.The Cabinet were reminded that, while a RoyalCommission could be empowered to call evidence, etc.,it could not compel the attendance of witnesses who refused to appear before it *The suggestion was made that what was required was an Inquiry of a judicial character, for which a small-15-
body of three or five persons would suffice,The Secretary of State for War again warned theCabinet of the very grave dangers to the publicinterest which in his view and in that of the WarOffice were involved in the proposed. Inquiry.    Ifthere was to be a Royal Commission it would be necessary -sary at some stage to disclose to the Commissionmost secret information, and. this would have to bedone in camera.    Prom this point of view it would bedesirable if the membership of the Commission couldbe kept as small as possible and limited, to responsiblepersons, such as Privy Counsellors.General agreement was expressed with the view that,if possible, the announcement of the Royal Commission,-!:.ight bemade if pressed before the Adjournment- on December21st, and that this should also be so even if it wasnot then found possible to publish the name of theChairman.The Cabinet took note that the PrimeMinister proposed to confer in regardto the matter with certain of hiscolleagues, including the Secretaryof State for War and. the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.

APPENDIX.COMMITTEE ON GERMAN RE-ARMAMENT.Extract from Report    -   Paper No.  CP.  295 (34).x x x x x x x(i)    An attempt must be made to get the FrenchGovernment to face the actual facts and,particularly, that it would appear impracticable to expect Germany to scrap what she is in processof building up in regard to armaments, in orderthat a fresh start might be made in a new agreement.(ii)    It is considered that the situation vis a visGermany must be taken as it is to-day, bearing that mind that the return of Germany to the league and to the Disarmament Conference is essential for the establishment and maintenance of peace in Europe.(iii)    In developing the question of Germany&apos;s returnto the League, we should put forward our viewthat, while we do not in any way condone Germany&apos;transaction in leaving the League, we can conceive ofno real basis for the establishment and maintenanceof peace in Europe so long as Germany remainsoutside.(iv)    The point should be made that we are fullyconvinced of the illegality of Germany&apos;s re-armament but it is considered to have reachedthe stage when its recognition has become inevitable and to press strongly the point that it is far better that this re-armamentshould be controlled than that it should remainuncontrolled,(v)    If the French Government should raise thepoint that Germany has, in fact, succeeded by a policy of blackmail, we should not perhapsdissent but; we should ask Prance what are the alternatives.(vi)    Germany will certainly demand equality of rightsand may conceivably not be content with the ideaof the status quo.     We should recognise nothing to begin with beyond what has been done, but in negotiating the Convention Germany should be inthe same position as the others in upholding whatfigures she thinks she requires to be inserted in the Schedule.      If, for example, it wasconsidered that the figures inserted by germany would be likely to menace our security or thesecurity of France, then we should stronglychallenge them, but if it should be possible toget an agreed schedule, then this schedule would,in fact, be itself a guarantee of securitybecause the Powers concerned would be satisfiedthat none of the figures accepted for any other country were a menace to their security.
(ix)    The possibility must always be faced thatGermany will not be prepared to accept the suggestions put forward.      This would be serious, but not more serious than the presentsituation developed as Germany means todevelop it.(x)    That if, during the course of the negotiationsPrance should raise rights under Article 213of the Treaty of Versailles,  it could oe pointedout that while it would appear extremely unlikely that this Article would ever been forced,  it might be possible,  by international agreement, to arrange for a system of inspectionto.which Germany herself has not objected,provided it is of general application to allcountries.x       x       x       x       x       x       x(vii)    A particular point to be made is that it isnot proposed to legalise what Germany has done, but rather to recognise the fact of herre-armament up to date;    but there should beno question, at present, of recognising anyfurther developments before and until thewhole matter is negotiated at Geneva.(viii)    If a Convention can be negotiated at geneva on the lines suggested above,  it is on the clear understanding that it will only replace those clauses of Part V of the Treaty ofVersailles which are directly affected.      Thiswould mean,  for example, that the clause dealingwith the Demilitarised Zones would not be amatter    for discussion.
