With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the terms of the following Motion noticeof which was given on the 6th November by theLabour Opposition in the House of Commons:-Private Manufacture and Trade in Arms,-That this House endorses the view expressedin the Covenant of the League of nations that manufacture of munitions of war by private enterprise is open to grave objection,regrets the absence of any international agreement to deal with this admitted evil,and is of opinion that this Country should set an example by prohibiting forthwith allprivate manufacture of and trade in arma-ments by British nationals and by making provision for the production by the Stateof such armaments and munitions of war as are considered necessary.To this Motion the Liberal Opposition hadtabled the following amendment:-Line 3, leave out from &quot;objection,&quot; to end, and add &quot;records its conviction that international action is urgently requiredto deal with the traffic in arms, whichfoments disorder and strife, and furtherconsiders that an investigation should beheld into -(a) the manufacture and trade in munitions of war,  includingexisting methods of promotingtheir sale;(b) the relations between Governmentdepartments and armament manufacturers;(c) the effectiveness of the presentmethods of controlling the armstraffic between the United Kingdomand Foreign countries;(d) the desirability of creating aGovern-ment monopoly of armament manufacture;and that for this purpose a special commission should be constituted with powers to requirethe attendance of witnesses to take evidence on oath, and to call for the production of documents whether in private hands or inGovernment departments.The suggestion was made that perhaps the &quot;bestprocedure would be for some distinguished supporters of the Government in the House of Commons to movean amendment to the Mot-ion the terms of which theGovernment and their supporters could accept.
General agreement was expressed with the viewthat the only effect of a United Kingdom Inquiryon the lines of the Inquiry now being made by the senate of the United. States of America would be to destroy our export trade in munitions and benefitour foreign competitors.after considerable discussion the conclusions reached by the Cabinet, may be summarised as followsThe Proposed (a) To accept in principle that there United Kingdom should be an Inquiry held in theI Inquiry. United Kingdom, the main objects of which would he(i) ^o ascertain authoritativelythe argument? for and againstthe proposal that private manufacture and trade in armsand munitions should be prohibitedand. that there should be a Statemonopoly in the production ofarms and munitions:    and(ii) To examine the present arrangements in force in the United. Kingdomrelative to the control of theexport trade in arms and muni-tions, and to report whether these arrangements need revision, and,if so, in what directions:fh&apos;) The Terms of Reference of the United.Kingdom- Inquiry will require very careful drafting.   While the Commissionof Inquiry should be empowered to investigate specific charges in respectof particular Jt r a ns a c t ionsjg* a ny poss 1-bility of the Commission being turnedinto a roving or fishing Inquiry, suchas that conducted by the Nye Committeeof the Senate of the United. States,should be precluded:(e) That a strong, impartial and independentpersonality should be secured as theChairman of the proposed Commission of inquiry:Bhe,(Qppoait.ion (d) That arrangements should be made forpotion Prooe- an amendment to be moved to Mr Lansbury&apos;s*-fure&apos; Motion, which, in accordance with custom,,would take priority over the Liberalamendment:(e) That the terms of this amendment should,be settled by the Prime Minister,, theLord. President  of the Council and theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs in consultation, and that they shouldalso settle in whose names the amendment should be put down.   For text seeAppendix II..
If) ?hai the amendment should contain no reference to the proposed UnitedKingdom Inquiry.   The announcementof this Inquiry should be reservedfor the opening speech of theGovernment spokesman&apos;:(g) That in the course o** his speech theGovernment spokesman at the openingof the Debate should explain the true position regarding the Inquiry atGeneva in 192$&apos;, and should comment onthe propaganda based on the perversionof the findings of this Inquiry.   Heshould also refer to the Inquiry bythe Wye Gotrolitt.ee of the United StatesSenate, and should state our conviction that our arrangements for the controlof the export of arms and munitionsare satisfactory, and that it would bea great gain if other countries would bring their arrangements, in theoryand in practice, up to our level.He should also state that the Govern-ment are satisfied that the private manufacture of arms and munitions isan essential interest of the UnitedKingdom, and explain the reasons forthis conclusion:^h) ^hat the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be the opening spokesmanfor the Government in the Debate on mr Lansbury&apos;s Motion, and that the lord&quot;President of the Council should wind upthe Debate on behalf of the Government.-4- and -5-
2.   With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet were informed that since their last Meeting informal discussions had takenplace with the Japanese and the American repre-sentatives, and that it was proposed to have a formal Meeting with the Japanese representatives that afternoon at 4 p.m.   At this Meeting it wouldbe explained to the Japanese why the United&apos; kingdom could not accept in its present form the Japaneseproposal for a common upper limit of total tonnage.The Japanese would also be told that,- in our view,the question of&quot; prestige could be.met by the insertion in any future Naval Treaty of a generaldeclaration of equality of national status .    If theJapanese were unwilling that an agreement in regardto future building programmes should be expressedin Treaty form, we should be prepared to accept anarrangement whereby each party to the Treaty wouldmake a separate declaration of its intentions in thematter of naval construction over a specific periodof years,, the terms of such declarations being agreed between the parties beforehand.   Each Power would heat liberty to modify the figures contained in itsdeclaration in advance, notice to this effect havingbeen given to the other parties to the Tre:a&apos;ty,If the Japanese were prepared to accept inprinciple a solution on the above lines, the nextstep would be to secure agreement on actual pro-grammes .   We remained of opinion that there was no justification for any Japanese claim teychange inrelative naval strengths, and v?e should thereforeendeavour to persuade Japan to accept a building programme which in practice would leave thepresent relative positions unaffected.
The Japanese might, of course, reply that a plan of this kind was useless to them as they wished toretain complete freedom of action.   On the other hand.,if the Japanese showed themselves interested in thesuggestion the negotiations could he continued.The view was expressed that even if the Japaneserejected the proposed solution and. stated that theywere not- prepared to agree to any arrangement underwhich they would be subjected to a quantitativelimitation, they might be ready to accept some formof limitation on a qualitative basis, and that,.if so,this would, be of very great advantage to the United.Kingdom.It was generally agreed that, qualitative limitation,if obtainable, would be of very great importance, butit was pointed out that It would, be dangerous toadvanee too rapidly towards a qualitative limitationobjective, as the United States might take up the   -position that it would be better to have no agreement at all than one confined to a scheme of qualitativelimitation.The Cabinet took note that proposals onthe above lines would, be submitted by theBritish representatives&apos; to the Japaneserepresentatives at their Meeting to beheld that afternoon at 4 p.m.(NOTE?

TheGovernments had. been asked, to define their attitudetowards the proposals at the session ofC omm.it teewhich would open at Budapest on November 20th.   Theproposed amendments to the Agreement were complicated,ahd for the most part did. not affect the United kingdom at all, but it was necessary for the Cabinet to decide whether support should, be given in principle to theproposal for a prolongation of the Agreement.   Itappeared to the President of the Board of Trade thatthe reasons for which the United Kingdom had. adhered to the original Agreement were equally valid reasonsfor not opposing its continuance, and that if the exporting countries were agreed, in desiring an extensionof the Agreement for two years the United. Kingdom could,not very well refuse assent.    He therefore proposed,with the concurrence of the Minister of Agricultureand. Fisheries, to instruct the United Kingdom repre-sentative on the Wheat Advisory Committee in this sense, provided that no new obligations were imposed on the United Kingdom, and sought Cabinet approval to this course.Emphasis was laid, on the importance of ensuring that any continuance of the original Agreement should,be subject to the provision that no new obligationsare imposed on the United Kingdom,
The Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposal of thePresident of the Board of Tradeto Instruct the United kingdom representative on the WheatAdvisory Committee that if the exporting countries were agreed in desiring an extension of theAgreement for two years the UnitedKingdom could not refuse assent,but that any such extensionmust be subject to the condition that no new obligations areimposed on the United.

TheChurch of England favoured the stabilisation of Easterprovided there was general ecclesiastical agreement -especially agreement of the Roman Church.   The Holy See,however, was opposed to the proposal, maintaining thepoint of view that the Stabilisation of Easter was a pre-eminently religious quest-ion which fell within thecompetence of the Holy See.   The subject was raised from time to time in both Houses of Parliament, and recent Questions had been answered by referring to enquiries which had been made under the auspices ofthe league of Nations.   The present position, as itappeared, to the Home Secretary, was that the conditionswhich Parliament contemplated should exist before the bringing of the Act into operation did. not in fact yetexist, although successive Governments had. done allthat could reasonably be expected to create such-13-

He therefore asked the Cabinet toagree that no further action should be taken at thepresent time to bring into operation the Easter Act,1928, and that he should be authorised to announce that the Government had so decided, if and when thematter was raised again in Parliament.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thelarge volume of support, both in Parliament and in thecountry, for the stabilisation of Easter, and it wassuggested that the announcement in Parliament shouldbe   . framed in sympathetic terms and should be basedon the difficulty of securing international agreementrather than on the denominational objections.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposal of the HomeSecretary that no further astion shouldbe taken at the present time to bring into operation the Easter Act, 1928,and that the Home Secretary should beauthorised to announce this decisionif and when the matter was again raised in Parliament.

In the course of discussion the Cabinet were informed that it would be necessary in any event forthe Cabinet Committee to hold a further Meeting toconsider certain outstanding matters, notably thosereferred to under recommendation (l) (a), (c) and(d) above.  -With regard to the question, of the responsibilityfor the scheme in Scotland, the Cabinet were informedthat after considerable discussion the Committee had invited the Secretary of State,for,Scotland to confer on the subject with the Minister of Labour, on theunderstanding that if the two Ministers were unable toreach agreement the question (which, in essence, wasa political one) should be left for determination bythe Cabinet.

Water undertakers, however,aided by the special powers of the Water Supplies(Emergency Shortage Orders) Act, 1934, had withstoodthe test well, and in sonly a few urban areas had therebeen any hardship.   Rural districts had suffered most,the drought having emphasised the need for betterpermanent supplies .   These rural needs were now beingmet by the Government&apos;s  1,000,000 grant.   The Memoran-dum continued that experience of the drought had emphasised the need of better organisation of waterresources, by the rationalisation of administrativeareas in order to bring them into closer correspondence with natural areas, and by better control of access to sources of supply;    of more effective planning of future schemes of water supply between undertakerswith common interests in sources of supply&apos;   of themore equitable distribution of water in streams andrivers between water undertakers and riparian interestsand of the modernisation of the Waterworks Clauses Act.legislation on these subjects was long overdue, andsome of the measures, indeed, raised major issues ofpolicy and were very controversial.   Ho doubt pressure of business rendered such legislation in the coming session impracticable^ and in the circumstances theMinister of Health proposed, with the approval of hiscolleagues, to prepare a White Paper, which would besubmitted to the Cabinet, summarising the measurescontemplated by the Government, and then to present itand move for its consideration by a Joint SelectCommittee of both Houses of Parliament, in the lightof whose Report a Bill would, be prepared,-let-
After a brief discussion, in the.course of whichthe Minister of Health undertook to confer with theMinister of Agriculture and. Pisheri.es before circulating a draft White Paper to the Cabinet, the Cabinet agreed -To approve the proposal of the Ministerof Health that he should prepare and submit to the Cabinet a White.Papersummarising the measures contemplated by the Government, and should thenpresent the White- Paper to parliament and move for its consideration by aJoint Select Committee of both Housesfin the light of whose Report a bill would eventually be prepared.
10. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (C.P.-340 (34)) relatingto the position of the Electricity (Supply) Bill,1934, amending    in certain particulars the Electricity(Supply) Act, 1926,    After explaining the effect ofthe provisions of the Bill, which, with amendment,had passed through all its stages in the House ofLords last May, and referring to the assurance his predecessor in office had received that the Govern-menfs Bill would be given very high priority as soonas the House met in October, the Minister gave his reasons for submitting that, if it was impossible tosecurethe passage of the Bill before the House wasprorogued, it was essential that it should, be re-introduced immediately upon Parliament reassembling,and given a Second Reading before Christmas.: . thatthe demand, for reference to a Select Committee shouldbe rejected:    and that the Committee Stage should betaken on the Floor of the House.   He hoped that theCabinet would see its way to assist the work of theCentral Electricity Board by a firm declaration ofits decision to place the Bill on&apos;the Statute Bookat a very early date and to authorise the arrangementsnecessary to give effect to that declaration.General agreement was expressed with the viewthat every effort should be made to expedite thepassage of the Bill into law as early as practicable in the 1934-35 Session, and the Prime minister informed the Cabinet that he hoped that arrangements could, be made to take the Bill immediately after theconclusion of the Debate on the King*s Speech and topass it through all its stages in the House ofCommons before the Christmas Recess.    If this wasnot done, considerable delay must be anticipated,having regard to the probability that Governmenti,20-
business would be very congested on the reassemblingof the House in January.The Cabinet took note of this statement and agreed that arrangements would bemade to ensure the passage^..into law ofthe Electricity (Supply) Bill, 1934,with the least possible delay in the1934-35 Session6
MALTA. 11.    The Cabinet had before there a Memorandums bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-244 ( 34))(previous reference: on the subject of Malta, recalling that on April 25thCabinet 33(34), Con- (Cabinet 17 (34), Conclusion 8) they had decided thatelusion 6.)a Bill formally abolishing the Malta constitution should not be introduced unless circumstances arosewhich made such an act imperative:    e.g,, if the malta Courts should give a Judgment which impededCrown Colony Government.   The Secretary of State had now received a telegram, from the Governor of Maltastating that an action had been commenced by Mizzi,the moving spirit and chief offender among the lateMinisters, to obtain a. declaration of invalidity ofOrdinances passed by the present Government, on theground that the state of grave emergency, on whichsuspension of the Constitution was based, was non-existent.     The Secretary of State hoped that the maltese Courts would dismiss the action, but in thecontrary event he felt that he ought to warn the.Cabinet that a. situation might arise in which it wouldbe necessary to legislate here immediately in orderto legalise our position.The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that, while it was not necessaryfor them to taxe any decision at the moment, itmight become imperative to invite Parliament toas a matter of urgencypass a short Bill/.      If the Maltese Courtsdecided in effect that the Ordinances passed by thepresent Government of Malta were invalid, thewhole machinery of Government in Malta would beheld up and it would accordingly be necessary forthe Imperial Parliament immediately to legislate to legalise the position.      He had-22-
instructed the Governor of Malta to take stepsto ensure that the action commenced by Mizzi wascontested with the utmost vigour.The suggestion was made that the Secretary ofState for the Colonies should confer with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs before taking any important action, having regard to the repercussions which this question might have on ourrelations with Italy.        In this connection reference was made to the question tabled in the ItalianChamber of Deputies on the subject of the use ofthe Italian language in the Maltese Courts, andthe view was expressed that it was highly desirablethat in any Debate in the House of Commons careifiUtci (&quot;tuU&quot; ihj.   m   /should be taken not to use language -which might beiiyu CoaUs -faflti    Iregarded in Italy as provocative.The Cabinet took note of the warning of theHp*f* OM.d  CM Ltdred qifuaii&amp;u ) Secretary of State for the Colonies thatat any moment the situation in Maltamight make it necessary to introduceimmediate legislation into Parliament to legalise our position in Malta.
THE NAVALI CONSTRUCTIONj PROGRAMME,(1934.previous reference:[Cabinet 4 (34)conclusion 8).12,With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Pirst Lord of the Admiraltyinformed the Cabinet that f^ag-. firms had submittedtenders for the two large Cruisers to be built in private yards.      There was only a difference of  23,000 between the highest and the lowest of-tte^&amp;e^tenders.      The lowest tender was Vickersof Barrow, the next I-oweo-t- Scott    of the Clyde,the next te^eSfe-Cammell Laird of the Mersey and thehighest tender was Hawthorn Leslie of the Tyne.He proposed to give one Cruiser to Vickers (the lowest tender)o But for the Cammell Laird tenderhe would have been disposed to have given the contract for the other Cruiser to the Tyne, havingregard to the very heavy unemployment on Tyneside.&apos;After some discussion in the course of v/hichthe view was expressed that exceptional circumstances,such as heavy unemployment in the shipbuilding industry, might justify some departure from the strict rule that the lowest satisfactory tender -should be accepted, the Cabinet agreed -That a Committee composed as follows -The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for Dominionj-iff airs ,The First Lord of the Admiralty,. andThe Minister of Labour,should carefully consider all the relevant facts including the state of unemployment and the amount and value of Government and private orders on the Clyde, Mersey and Tyne.respectively, and recommend to the cabinet at their next meeting regard-ing      the allocation of the two Cruisersin question.a* Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,7th November, 1954*
APPENDIX. I.THE  SUGGESTED POWERS,  DUTIES,  AND FUNCTIONS of the PROPOSED&apos; COMMISSIONER&apos;FOR THE DEPRESSED AREAS.1.      The general functions of the Commissioner are defined asfollows s-&quot;to he responsible for the initiation, organisation andprosecution of schemes designed to facilitate the economic development and social improvement of the four Areassurveyed by the Investigators&quot; .(N.B. The exact delimitation of the Areas to be coveredand the question whether power should be taken to extendthem will need careful consideration).The ab^ve general definition is subject to two limitations,(i)  Ordinarily he is to devote himself to work which&quot;cannot be dene under existing powers.(ii) He will not have power to subsidise industrial.....undertakings trading for profit.2.      The first of these limitations means that he will not beable to undertake schemes of a kind which are already being done or can be done.by Government Departments or Local Authorities,and that any assistance he might give towards such schemes wouldhave to be of a different nature from that available from theappropriate Department.      Outside this field a number of proposals have been made of which the most  important are the following.-(a) Improving the amenities of the depressed areas - e.g. bythe removal of slagheaps, the clearance of derelictfactory sites etc.(b) Provision of occupational centres for the unemployed,including agricultural subsistence holdings and other centres where the products of the members are retained by or are exchanged among themselves.(c) Experiments in agricultural holdings in the depressed areas,  including co-operative holdings.      (Underexperiments of this kind farming operations involving theemployment of workpeople might be undertaken by a corporation, with the assistance of the Commissioner).
The Commissioner should have power to assist schemesof the above types;    but in the case of occupational centreshis power to assist should be limited to centres not carriedon for profit.3.       The Commissioner should also have power to consider forassistance other schemes which satisfy the conditions ofparagraph (l) above.4.       The Commissioner should not be precluded from assistingschemes outside the depressed areas which would employ work-,people from those areas.5.       While as already stated the Commissioner should not beempowered to undertake works falling within the existing powers or duties cf Government Departments or Local Authoritieshe should be at liberty to bring to the notice of theappropriate Government Department or Local Authority schemes which in his view satisfy the main condition in paragraph 1and ought  to be carried out.      The Commissioner could alsobring to the notice of the appropriate Department anysuitable schemes which were not being carried out. owing tothe inability of Local Authorities to finance them or to someother difficulty.      The case of land drainage provides an example of the way in which the Commissioner might work underthis procedure.    There are land drainage works which couldprofitably be undertaken and which would provide a good dealof employment in Durham, South Wales and West Cumberland.The Ministry of Agriculture consider it undesirable to make grants in aid of land drainage except to Catchment Boards.Difficulty arises in setting up Catchment Boards owing to theobjections of County Boroughs which would be involved in increased rates disproportionate to the advantages they would obtain.      If, however,  it could be announced that, provided the Commissioner recommended it, a grant would be made fromthe Exchequer sufficient to allay the fears of the localauthorities concerned it is probable that the objections tosetting up Catchment Boards would disappear.
5. It seems undesirable that the Commissioner himselfshould carry out schemes,  as this would involve him in amass of detail.      He should be empowered to enter intoarrangements with other persons or bodies for the carryingout of such schemes as fall within his province, e.g.  thecleaning up of the depressed areas might be carried outthrough an Amenities Trust, the co-operative agricultural holdings through an Agricultural Corporation,  the provisionof occupational centres or other welfare work through somevoluntary organisation.7. Existing Exchequer grants made in respect of welfarework in or on behalf of the depressed areas e.g.  grants to the National Council for Social Service, and any additional grants to be made for similar.purposes should infuture be made through the Commissioner.8. In order that he may be able to carry out his-functions it will be necessary to give the Commissionerpower to acquire land expeditiously and compulsorily, to-hold land, to sell it and to transfer it   to LocalAuthorities,or public bodies.9. Questions may arise whether the Commissioner can accept contributions from non-Government sources.Provided there are not attached to these contributionsconditions which would embarrass the Commissioner in hisfreedom of action or render him accountable to  putsi.de&apos;bodies, it is thought that he should have such powers./1Q.       The Commissioner will have wide discretion but willbe subject to the general control of the Minister of Labour.Arrangements will be made for all necessary consultations with the Departments and bodies concerned including theUnemployment Assistance Board.J7
11. For the purpose of meeting the expenditure of theCommissioner,  it is proposed that a sum of  X should he votedto a separate Fund under the control of the Treasury, to heexpended by them in such annual issues to the Commissioner as parliament may from time to time determine.      Some additional sum would presumably have to be voted to the Commissionerdirect for his needs in the current year.      This procedureappears to permit provision of funds out of this year&apos;s budget and at the same time to allow Parliamentary control over the issues from year to year./t2. It is suggested that the Commissioner should beappointed for three years , after which, unless parliament should determine otherwise, such of his powers, duties and responsibilities as have been proved to be of continuing valuemight &quot;be transferred to the Unemployment Assistance Board./7
