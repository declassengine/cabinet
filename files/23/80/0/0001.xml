TFB COAL-MIMINGINDUSTRY.The Dispute inSouth Wales.2, T^he President of the Board of Trade informed    *the Cabinet, of recent events in the South Wales coal-field,   &quot;&quot;here had been two points of controversy.The first related&apos;to the finding, in 1931, of Mr P.?.Schiller, K.O., the Independent Chairman of theSouth Wales Conciliation Board, in regard to subs ist-ence rates and minimum percentage.   This finding hadbeen strongly objected to at the time by the men,and in 19 35 they had asked the owners for a discussion on wages.   These discussions proceeded before theSouth Wales Conciliation Board, and in the Spring of1934 the negotiations broke down, owing to the failureof the two sides to agree on a new form of conciliation machinery to take the place of that Board.^he second point related to the standard rates ofwages .   The men desired, a return to the 1930 level, butthe owners opposed this on the ground that- there had.not merely been no improvement in the trade since 1930,but that the position now was definitely worse thanit was then,    &quot;&quot;hey had also represented that while thevarious Trade Agreements which had been concluded hadno doubt assisted, other coalfields in Great Britain,they had not helped South Wales.After the negotiations between the owners and men had broken down, the Lord President of the Counciland the President of the Board of Trade had. authorised the Secretary for Mines to inform, both sides that theGovernment proposed to set up a new tribunal todetermine the issues, consisting of three impartialpersons, of whom two would be nominated by theGovernment and the third by the two sides in theSouth Wales coal industry.    After considerable delay      jboth sides had agreed to this proposal, and there hadbeen a heavy vote in its favour by the men. It wouldhave been the height of folly if the men had ceasedwork at this time, as trade would have been lost.
some of it permanently.   The settlement in conteropla-tion was based on three years peace in the district,which should enable the trade to revive and foreignorders secured.In conclusion, the President of the Board of Tradedrew, attention to the admirable and successful efforts of the Secretary for Mines in the conduct of thismatter to a satisfactory settlement.The Cabinet took note of this communication, and requested the President of the Board ofTrade to convey to the Secretaryfor Mines their congratulationson the way in which recent develop-ments in the South Wales coal disputehad been handled by him and his department ,
3. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP,-218 (34)) circulating aReport by Sir Frederick leith-Ross of his discussions in Berlin on the subject of the maintenance of Anglo-German trade and payment of trade debts.   The Memo-randum stated that the only method,offered by theGerman Government to meet British requirementsappeared to be by means of a Clearing Agreement.Sir F. Leith-Ross prefaced his Report by some general impressions of the situation, in Germany,and after giving a resume&apos; of his discussions inBerlin (September 18 - 27) summarised as followsthe questions which had to be decided:-&quot;(l) Do His Majesty&apos;s Government accept theprinciple that a Clearing agreementoffers the only available method, of safeguarding British trading andfinancial interests and that it must therefore be contemplated?(2)  If so, do His Majesty&apos;s Government agree -(a) that negotiations should be resumed,with a view to arriving at a limitedClearing agreement on the linessketched out in paragraph 13 above,covering mutual trade and. frozendebts, to be brought into force fromthe 1st November to the 31st December,the German Government meanwhile being left to assure the payment of interest on the Dawes and Young Loans?(b) that the treatment of the Standstillbills should be settled in such manner as the British Standstill creditorsand the Reichsbank may agree to be best calculated to maintain thepresent position provided that no netcharge can be accepted on the Clearingaccount except, possibly, in respectof the cost of interest?(o) that the question whether a Clearingin this limited form should be continuedafter the 1st January next or whetherthe Clearing, should then be extendedto cover financial obligations wouldbe reserved for settlement in December?(3) Do His Majesty&apos;s Government agree that 55per cent /can be accepted as the normalproportion of the Clearing to be reservedfor United Kingdom domestic exports, andthat 10 per cent, can be accepted as theallocation for frozen debts?&quot;
Sir Frederick suggested that if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment agreed to the above recommendations, instructions should be given to the Departments concerned to workout as rapidly as possible detailed drafts both ofthe agreement with Germany and of the detailedmeasures required for putting the Clearing into forcein this country, to explore the various outstandingthe next Meeting of administrative questions, and to bring to/the Cabinetany further matters on which decisions were required,in order that the negotiations in Berlin could be resumed about October 15th. -&quot;he Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade had considered, these proposals-,and recommended, their acceptance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew the attentionof the Cabinet- to the main features of Sir frederick leith-Rossrs Report, and stated at the outset thatin his opinion Sir Frederick had done extremely wellthroughout these very difficult negotiations, and hadin the end secured the probable acceptance by germany of proposals very much more satisfactory from our point of view than he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer)had. thought possible when the United Kingdom delgation had gone to Germany a fortnight ago.It was quite clear that the Germans contemplateda Clearing arrangement and were not prepared to proceed on any other lines.   Both he and the President of theBoard of Trade disliked a Clearing arrangement, whichwas open to serious objections, bait there was no practicable alternative, and the Chancellor of theExchequer suggested that the answer to the first question in paragraph 19 of the Report should thereforebe given in the affirmative.
If the Cabinet accepted this view it is? cm Id thenbe necessary to consider the precise scope of the clearing ar r a ng eraent s .    In th is respect th.e s It v.a t i onwas governed by the fact that while the United kingdom were in a favourable bargaining position vis-^-vis,Germany, our position was not so strong as to enable us to insist on all our requirements.It would be observed that interest on the Dawesand Young Loans was to be excluded from the Clearing.This interest was at present covered by the existing agreement, but Dr Schacht had indicated that germany would probably have to default on this Agreement owingto the absence of sufficient exchange to meet theinterest payments .   Baron Weurath, with whom sir frederick Leith-Ross had discussed the matter, hadnot, however, taken anything like so serious a view.As would be seen from paragraphs 14 and 15 of theReport, the proposal was that out of the payments madeby British importers in sterling to the ClearingAccount, 55 per cent, should be reserved for- payment&apos;to United Kingdom exporters, and not less than 10per cent, for liquidation of the frozen debts.   this latter provision should suffice to liquidate these,debts in about 13 months, and with this arrangementour traders should be very well satisfied, as in thecase of agreements made by Germany with other countries the arrangements for liquidating the frozen debts ofthose countries were spread over a period up to twoyears.    There would then remain a surplus of 35 percent,, out of which the Reiehsbanfc could meet theinterest on the Dawes and Young   Loans and other similar obligations.On the whole, it seemed best to keep the interest-on the Young and Dawes Loans out of the Clearing.
It was contemplated that the arrangements would,continue until the 31st December, the date on whichthe present Exchange Agreement terminated, but it was intended.to include provisions in the new Agreementenabling its extension or modification after that date.It was also proposed to leave the Standstill billsout of the Clearing, but the precise way in whichthese bills were to be treated was to be settled bythe British Standstill creditors and the Reichsbankon the basis of the maintenance of the present position,provided, that no net charge was accepted on the clearing Account except, possibly, in respect of thecost of interest.It should also be observed (paragraph 15) thatthe Germans were prepared to give an undertaking as tothe favourable treatment (within the agreed ratio) ofparticular items of British exports which it was important for us to safeguard, and as to the maintenanceof the normal channels of trade in regard to thepurchase of raw materials through United Kingdom re-exporters .   The first of these had reference to coal and herrings, the import of which the Germans maintainedwas not essential to them..   Had Sir Frederick Leith-Ross been in a position to settle on the spot, he was convinced that he could have secured a satisfactory arrangement in regard to coal and herrings.    It wasnot certain that as satisfactory an arrangement couldbe secured, in future, but he would, of course, make every effort to obtain the best possible terms inrespect of these commodities.The second matter had reference, inter, alia,to exports to Germany of the Colonial Empire, whiohwere either direct exports from a Colony to germany or were exported by the Colony to England, and re-exported to Germany.   The Germans had made every use-7-..
of the fact that their imports from the Empire as awhole substantially exceeded their exports to theEmpire.    Sir Frederick Leith-Ross had experienced.very great difficulties in this part of the discus-.sions, and fully realised the danger that while he mightobtain/ some advantage for the Colonies; this might be at theexpense of the United Kingdom exporter.    Sir Frederickhad discussed the matter with the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies t and would endeavour to reach thebest possible settlement on the lines of that discussion.In conclusion, the Chancellor of the Exchequerrecommended the Cabinet to give an affirmative answer&apos;  to the questions raised in paragraphs 19 and 20 ofthe Report, and expressed the opinion that in this event there was a good prospect of a satisfactory agreement with Germany being reached.In the course of discussion it was agreed thatNewfoundland should be treated as in precisely thesame position as a Colony.The Cabinet were informed that the Government ofIndia were very interested, in the negotiations now proceeding, and that arrangements ha--1 been made undere-ffb4Qh Sir Frederick Leith-Ross would be ent-r-usted with- fee- safeguarding of Indian interests, on oimilar linoot-e-4hr8-4^0lr&amp;R4^rl--4fHrfe^N^^TS- ,The President of the Board of Trade pointed outthat Germany had already made 18 agreements with various foreign countries.   While Clearing might beopen to grave objection, it was at all events betterthan that we should be altogether shut out of tradewith Germany.    He therefore recommended the Cabinet toadopt the proposals.mhe Secretary of State for the Colonies- explainedthat as regards the Colonial Empire Sir frederick leith-Ross would not try to secure a merely negative
formula, but would, endeavour to get the Germans to .agree to some positive arrangement under which thepresent proportion of their imports from the colonies would, be maintained, with a clear definition as to,how that proportion was to be calculated.    This mustbe secured, without in any way prejudicing the UnitedKingdom trader .After some further discussion, the Cabinet agreed.(a) That questions  (l),  (S-) and (3)  inparagraph 19 of the Report of sir frederick Leith-Ross (CP.-218 (34))should be answered, in the affirmative,vis.:-(l) His Majesty&apos;s Government accept theprinciple that a Clearing agreement-offers the only available method of safeguarding British trading and.financial interests and that it must therefore be contemplated.(2) His Majesty&apos;s Government agree  (a) that negotiations should be resumed with a view to arriving at a limited Clearing agreement on the lines sketched out inparagraph 13 above, coveringmutual trade and frozen debts,to be brought into force from-the 1st November to the 31stDecember, the German Governmentmeanwhile being left to assure the payment of interest on the dawes and Young   Loans.(b) that the treatment of the Standstillbills should be settled, in. such manner as the British Standstillcreditors and. the Reichsbank may agree to be best calculated tomaintain the present positionprovided that no net charge canbe accepted on the Clearingaccoturt except, possibly, inrespect of the cost of interest.(c) that the question whether a clearing in this limited form,should be continued after the 1stJanuary next or whether the Clearingshould then be extended to coverfinancial obligations would be  -reserved for settlement in December.(3) His Majesty&apos;s Government agree that55 per cent, can be accepted as thenormal proportion of the Clearing tobe reserved for United Kingdomdomestic exports, and that 10 percent, can be accepted as the allo-cation for frozen debts.
(b) That the Departments concerned should work out detailed drafts both of theAgreement with Germany and of the detailed measures required for putting the Clearing into force in this country,and should be instructed to proceed as rapidly as possible with this work andto bring up at the next Meeting of theCabinet any further questions on which decisions are required, so that thenegotiations in Berlin may be resumedabout the 15th October.
GERMAN CONTROLOF exchange and IMPORTS.The Case of theDunlop RubberCompany.4.      In connection with the discussion summarised in the preceding Conclusion, the Chancellor of theExchequer drew the attention of the Cabinet to a request for advice which had been received from sir eric Geddes, the Chairman of the Dunlop RubberCompany,  in the following circumstances.The Dunlop Rubber Company owned a certainfactory in Germany in which considerable capitalhas been invested.      The factory holds three weeks&apos;stock of rubber and unless it is allowed to importmore rubber it must close down, in which case it willprobably not be allowed to reopen.The local representative of the Dunlop RubberCompany asked Dr.  Schacht for permission to importrubber for use in the factory.      This permissionwas refused.A German rubber company then approached theDunlop Rubber Company and suggested that Dunlop&apos;should provide rubber and other raw materials duringthe next three months and that the German company should resell 25 per cent,  of the amount to Dunlop&apos;sGerman Company so as to enable them to carry on.Dunlop&apos;s German Company v^ould pay for their shareof this rubber etc.  in Reichsmarks, but the Germancompany would be responsible for paying Dunlop&apos;s inLondon in sterling at the end of three years.      the reichsbank would guarantee this sterling payment.It appeared that not only rubber but cotton and carbonblack were involved, and it might be noted that all three commodities had other than peace-time uses.It had also been ascertained that oil companies inGermany were being pressed to keep four months&apos;s supply in hand and also a reserve of one million tons to be
held on account of the German Government and to he-paid for in five years&apos;  time.      The Governor of theBank of England had &quot;been consulted on the Dunlop &apos;proposal which he was not prepared to oppose but whichhe indicated had political considerations.      TheChancellor of the Exchequer pointed out tha t theGovernment had no power to stop the Dunlop RubberCompany if they decide to proceed with the scheme.He proposed to inform Sir Eric Geddes that if hisCompany could obtain permission from the German Govern-into Germanyment to import/such rubber and other materials as were required for their own needs,  there was no objectionto the transaction., but that the Government were notprepared to advise the Company to enter into theparticular arrangement in contemplation,that if theDunlop Company decided to proceed with that schemeit must be with the knowledge that the Governmentdisapproved of such action, and that the entire riskrested with the Company.      Moreover, he proposed to remind Sir Eric Geddes that&apos;a guarantee by the reichsbank was not comparable,to a guarantee bythe Bank of England.The Cabinet approved the line which theChancellor of the Exchequer.proposed totake with Sir Eric Geddes in this matter.
THE COLONIAL 5.    The Cabinet had before them the following!1 documents on the subject of the Foreign Trade ofForeign Trade0f.    &quot; the Colonial Empire:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies (C .P.-S18 (34))&apos; in which he drew attention to the unfortunate situation of Colonial producers arising from the excess of Empire production over Empireconsumption in commodities not subject toany regulation scheme, and their increasingdifficulties in selling their goods incertain foreign countries owing, among other reasons, to the conclusion of agree-ments on a preferential basis which hadthe effect of giving foreign producers of Colonial products&apos; preferential treatmentover producers in the Colonial Empire,To assist in remedying this state of affairsthe Secretary of State   for the Coloniessuggested that it should be the declared policy    of His Majesty&apos;s Government  (a) That in all trade negotiations betweenthe United Kingdom and foreign countriesparticular attention should be paid to securing at least equal treatment for colonial products in all matters relatingto duties, quotas, licences, etc,, andalso to ensuring that in the case ofarticles of Colonial interest whichare not of prime necessity (such astea, cocoa and fruit), foreign countriesshall admit the maximum quantity.ofsuch goods which is compatible with their trade position;    and(b) That, if diffictilties are encountered in.connection with these requirements,it should, be made plain that the UnitedKingdom will be as ready   to use the bargaining power arising from her largepurchases, of foreign goods to forceforeign countries to give favourable treatment of the kind required toColonial goods as she is to use that power in the interests of the actualproducts of the United Kingdom.A Memorandum by the President- of the Board,of Trade (0.P.-2lf (34)) in which he statedthat in cases of discrimination he would always be ready to bring the United Kingdominto action in defence of the Colonies,provided, that action, on our part had areasonable chance of achieving the removalof the offending discrimination and covildbe taken without disproportionate detriment to United Kingdom interests.   During thetrade negotiations of the last year and a half the interests of the Colonies hadnot been lost sight of, and by agreementbetween the Colonial Secretary and himselfhis Department had brought into thenegotiations requests for favourable treat-ment of Colonial products.   That the positionof the Colonies had been kept well in mind was also evident from, the recommendations-13- &apos;(previous reference:Cabinet 251(34), Con-elusion 5.)P. ft.
made in Sir Frederick Leith.-R.oss&apos;s Reporton his recent discussions with the GermanGovernment (.0 .P.-21S (34)).   The Presidentof the Board of Trade therefore suggestedthat the Cabinet should refrain from laying down general principles to govern allfuttire- trade negotiations between theUnited Kingdom and foreign countries inthis matter, and that it&apos;should be agreed  - - That the present practice of consulta-tion between the Board of Trade and theColonial Office in regard to negotiationswith foreign countries should be continued,and that individual cases of foreigndiscrimination against Colonial products and possibilities of the increase of colonial trade in foreign countries should be considered on their merits;the reconciliation between United.Kingdom and. Colonial interests (shouldthese be in conflict) being left for adjustment between the Colonial secretary and the President of the Board of Trade.The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that he was getting very anxious about the growing restrictions on Colonial tradeand instanced the recent agreement between Germanyand the Dutch East Indies as an example of what wasconstantly happening.        If the Empire could absorb the whole of its production there would be littleground for complaint, but this was not the case,and many of the Colonies depended on being able to export part of their production to foreign countries.The Colonies were giving us increased preferencesand larger quotas at a time when they themselves werebeing very seriously hit.      Preference must alwaysrest on goodwill and mutual benefit and purchasesby the Colonies of United Kingdom goods must dependon the purchasing power created in the colonies by the sales of their produce.      Unless theColonies could sell in their normal markets theymust incur deficits which the United Kingdom exchequer would have to meet.        There was also of course the moral argument that we were responsible for seeing that our Colonies were properly treated.
It was open to him to meet the si situation&quot;by direct negotiations and he was being pressed todo so, but he was not in favour of such a policy,and very much preferred to keep the Colonies andthe United Kingdom in one and the same negotiation,,The Board of Trade had misunderstood his proposal.He had never contemplated any action which would inany way prejudice the United Kingdom producer orexporter.        He wished to use the powerful leverof a favourable trade balance in cases where we had such a balance to obtain concessions for the colonies^-^md-aa-e-e-eait^^ the Polish negotiations.In the case of essential commodities foreign countries should continue to buy from us at least the oldproportion.      As regards nonessential commoditiesforeign countries often imposed such a heavyrevenue duty that they defeated their own object in raising revenue, or prejudiced us, e,g. bypenalising Empire tea in favour of Brazil coffee.He hoped that the Cabinet would approve the principlethat we should endeavour to get all advantages wepossibly could for the Colonial Empire provided this involved no prejudice or damage to the United Kingdom.In reply to the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs the Secretary of State for the Colonies &apos;agreed that for the purposes of the present disoussionNewfoundland should be regarded as a Colony.The Secretary of State for India sympathisedwith the Secretary of State for the Colonies and invited the Cabinet to have regard to the position ofIndia&apos;s export trade.      It might be urged that,  havingregard to constitutional developments, the proper course would be to leave the Government of Indiato make the best possible bargin for themselves, but he,the Secretary of State, was satisfied that the wisest
course would be to secure the closest possibleco-operation with India in this matter.      speaking generally India was concerned as a producer of primarycommodities many of which competed in the world markets with similar commodities of the colonial empire.      The interests of the United Kingdom were,however, affected because in commercial negotiationswith India there was very little indeed that we could offer to India as a quid pro quo for the grant oftrading favours to us.        There was no doubt thatwe could make much more satisfactory agreements with India if we had more to give and we might have more to give if we were prepared t o use our power in negotiations with foreign countries to securebenefits for India.      He suggested that the wholequestion was of such importance that it would be advantageous to have it further explored either by an inter-departmental committee or by a Cabinet committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer observedthat there was another aspect of the subject whichdemanded attention, namely, the growing dangerof serious competition between India, the colonies and the United Kingdom in the industrial field.This was not a matter with ?/hich the Dominions were much concerned.      On the whole the Colonies were under our direction and control and at present india was to some extent under our direction.      &quot;Whileit was improbable that W^st Africa would set upfactories to compete with those at home, there wasa real and serious danger of such factories being established in Malaya and possibly other parts ofthe Colonial Empire, and we might well be facedwith very serious developments of a problem ofindustrial competition/which we had already some experience    in the case of India.      He was in favour
of farther enquiry hut thought that this should, bea Cabinet and not an inter-departmental enquiry.The President of the Board of Trade reminded the Cabinet that this was no new problem and thatin nearly all the agreements which had recentlybeen concluded between the United Kingdom and foreigncountries, arrangements satisfactory to the colonies had been included;    these arrangements having beenmade in consultation and in agreement with theColonial Office arid the India Office.      He thoughtthat it would be a very great mistake to lay downany hard and fast rules on the subject, and that, it would be better to proceed on the existing lines and treat each case as it arose on its merits.General agreement was expressed with the viewthat the whole question required further detailed examination, and it was generally felt that it wouldbe undesirable to attempt to lay down a general rulingat all events in advance of the contemplated enquiry.Moreover, any such general ruling might be found veryinconvenient in practice.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed -(l)    That    the    present    practice under whichin cax5rying on negotiations for commercialagreements Colonial and Indian interests are borne in mind and promoted as far aspossible without serious prejudice to theinterests of the home trader, was theright one to follow in the presentcircumstances.        The Cabinet considered,however,that further enquiry would benecessary into the larger questions ofprinciple raised by the discussion.(2)    That the precise nature (composition ofcommittee and terms of reference), of theproposed enquiry should be reserved forfurther consideration,,

MALTA.Proposals for reform of the^ Courts.(previous reference:Cabinet 32 (34)Conclusion a6.    With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet were informed by theSecretary of State for the Colonies that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and himself had reached agreement on the question of the language in which instruction in law in the MaltaUniversity should in future be given.      after explaining that it had never been his intention that English should be substituted for Italianin the teaching of this subject and that theproposal was that in future teaching in lav/ at theUniversity would be given as a rule- in Maltese c%English, the Secretary of State expressed the opinionthat unless the change was made now there would belater ondifficulty/with Italy in explaining why the new.departure had been postponed to a later date.No technical difficulty was anticipated in bringing the change into effect. The undertaking whichhad been given in July last to the Counsellor ofthe Italian Embassy in London had reference toteaching generally in secondary schools andin the University and had no reference to this special question of the teaching of law in theUniversity.      For these reasons he, the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, hoped that he might beauthorised to proceed with the proposed changeat such time as the Governor of Malta and theRector of the University might think proper.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that in view of the explanation given by theSecretary of State for the Colonies he no longerwished to oppose the proposal on the understandingthat it was strictly limited to the teaching oflaw in the University.
The Cabinet agreed -(l)    To approve the proposal of theSecretary of State for the colonies that the Governor of Malta should he authorised to arrange for the existing law in Malta under which instruction in law in the Malta University is atpresent given in the Italian language,to be changed so as to provide thatin future such instruction shall begiven in Maltese(2)    That this change should take effect at a time to be determined by theGovernor of Malta and the Rector ofthe University of Malta in consultation.
