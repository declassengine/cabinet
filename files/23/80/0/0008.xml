fjERMAN RE-rig-it ofyew vonEibcentrop.[previous Reference:I Cabinet 171(34), Con-I elusion 16,)tMisfit.1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to the statement in &quot;The Times&quot; that morning that Herr von Ribbentrop,who in Germany holds the official position ofCommissioner for Armament, had. seen the Secretaryof State and also the Lord Privy Seal, and had explained to them &quot;the nature of such re-armament asis proceeding in Germany and to have stated, emphatic-ally that it had no aggressive purpose&quot;.It was true that Herr von Ribbentrop had seen the Secretary of State and the Lord Privy Seal, buthe had not referred at the interview to the subjectof German re-armament, and the conversation had been almost entirely concerned, with the social side ofhis visit to England.    &quot;The Times&quot; had not derived,their information from the Foreign Office, and it seemed probable that they had got it from some Germansource.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he understood, that Herr von Ribbentrop desired to see him for the purpose of assuring him.that German re-armament was not a menace to Europe and in order togive him certain facts and figures relating to german re-armament.    As at present advised the PrimeMinister was not disposed to see Herr von Ribbentrop.In the course of discussion it was suggested thatif Herr von Ribbentrop volunteered to give information about German re-armament it might be of some advantage to have it, although naturally his statements on thesubject would have to be received with great caution.On the other,hand, it might be embarrassing to us toreceive such information, particularly if Herr von -Ribbentrop gave it in response to a specific request.For example, we should be bound to communicate the
information to the French and we might he pressed to state what action we proposed to take.The Cabinet took note that the ministerial Committee on Disarm-am en t would give further consid-eration to this matter at their meeting on the following day.
REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(34), Con-c Ins ion 2.)2. No discussion took place on the subject of reduction and Limitation of Armaments, but the acting Secretary to the Cabinet was instructed tokeep it on the Agenda Paper.

The Cabinet were informed that a Meeting had.been held with the Dominion High Commissioners inLondon, and with General Smuts, at which the Secretaryof state for Foreign Affairs had summarised for thebenefit of the Dominion representatives the conversa-tions which had recently taken place with the japanese and American Delegations.   This explanation had.covered, both the political and. technical aspects ofthe matter, and the Dominion representatives had beeninformed, in strict confidence, that we had suggested to the Japanese that the question of prestige mightbe met by a general declaration of equality ofnational status, and that as regards future building programmes we would be prepared to accept an arrange-:ment whereby each party to the Treaty would make aseparate declaration of its intentions in the matterof Naval construction over a specified period ofyears, the terms of such declarations being agreed between the parties beforehand.   The Dominion repre-sentatives had also been informed that we had told the Japanese of our requirement that any generalagreement with them must include the safeguarding ofBritish rights in the Far Fast.There had been considerable discussion, in which general Smuts and Mr Bruce had taken leading parts,and at the close of the proceedings the dominion representatives had expressed themselves as in full agreement with the course which the United kingdom representatives had taken in the conversations.The Cabinet were informed that a Meeting with theUnited States Delegation would take place that after-noon, and that steps had been taken to correct anymisconception there might have been in the mind ofMr Norman Davis that the United Kingdom was attempting
to come to some arrangement with Japan inimical tothe interests of the United States,   No reply toour suggestions had yet been received from theJapanese, and it seemed probable that they were finding very great difficulty in knowing what answeito make.The Cabinet took note of this c ommunicat ion.-5-

The Secretary of State had accordingly decided that it was not practicable at present toproceed with a scheme of closer union.   He had,however, been impressed by the view, emphasised inthe Report, that the time had come when the inhabi-tants of the Windward and Leeward Islands should begiven a greater say in the conduct of local affairs,and he had accordingly instructed the Acting Governorsin despatches (copiss of which were appended to theMemorandum) for a vote to be taken in the IslandfollowingLegislatures on the   /    proposals set forth in hisMemorandums namely, that the official majorityshould be abolished;    that only those officials&quot;whose presence is necessary for the conduct ofbusiness should sit as members of the LegislativeCouncil;    that an unofficial majority should be created with elected as well as nominated members,on the definite understanding that (in addition tohis existing power of veto) the Governor would beempowered at any stage to carry any measure whichhe considered necessary in the interests of public order, public faith or other essentials of good government.

Supplies ofpetrolerafor.(previous o-usReference:Cabinet 59(54), Con-elusion 4.)10.     The Cabinet bad before them a Note by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP.-252 (34))circulating for the consideration of his colleaguesa Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines on a proposalto secure additional deliveries of oil to Germanyover a period of years, made on behalf of the GermanGovernment to the large oil groxips which supplyGermany with the bulk of her imports of oil.The Memorandum had been prepared as a result of consideration of the proposal by an Inter-Departmental(Paragraph 10)conference, whose e onclus ion/was that there were no sufficient grounds of public policy on which HisMajesty&apos;s Government could advise the Anglo-persian oil Company to reject the proposal:    but that; it-should be suggested, to the Company that they should secure the deletion of the condition as to deliverywithin two years, or, if that proved, impossible,that the period, over which payment was to be made should conform to the period of delivery.   ThePresident of the Board of Trade conciirred in this conclusion and sought the approval of the Cabinetto the action proposed. .In the course of discussion it was pointedout that the arrangements in contemplation would greatly strengthen Germany from the military point of view by providing her with this substantialoil reserve, and doubts were expressed whether in fact Germany would refrain from doing everythingshe could to develop her internal productionof oil by the existence of this reserve and theother contemplated arrangements for obtainingexternal supplies.      The suggestion was made thatGermanyTs real object was to obtain this reserve
and. also to proceed as rapidly and efficientlyas possible with the development of her internalresources.On the other hand, the Cabinet were assured that the Inter-Departmental Oommittoo which had examined the question had given prolongedconsideration to these aspects of the matter, andhad reached the conclusion that it would be preferable that Germany should remain dependenton external sources for her oil requirements rathe:than that she should be driven to rely entirely on her internal production.the Cabinet that he was in agreement with theconclusion reached by the President of the Boardof Trade.that the Defence Departments had not been represented on the Inter-Departmental Q-emsHtrt^-e-ewhich had examined the question.The Cabinet agreed -To approve the proposal of the Presidentof the Board of Trade that he should beauthorised to act in the matter of thesupply of petroleum to Germany on thelinos laid down in paragraph 10 of theThe Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Secretary of State for War observedflittco c p&amp;ge-r-t-

IS. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Scotland (CP.-251 (34))relative to the Educational Endowments (Scotland)Bill, which had been introduced in the Rouse ofComrnons on July 26, 1934.    As no time would beavailable for the further stages of the Bill duringthe remainder of the present Session the Secretaryof State asked authority to re-introduce the bill as soon as Parliament assembled for the new Session.The Memorandum added that unless the Bill was passed through all stages before December 31st the work ofthe Educational Endowments (Scotland) commission would then come to an end.The Cabinet took note of the positionin regard to the Educational Endowments(Scotland.) Bill, and agreed that theSecretary of State for&quot; Scotland, shouldbe authorised to&apos; re-introduce the bill as soon as practicable in the 1934-35Session, and. that ever;/ effort shouldbe made to secure the passage of theBill into law before December 31st next.
14. With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the fact that in his speech in the Houseof Commons on November 8th last, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs had not referred to theproposal for a United Kingdom Inquiry, as had been contemplated when the question was discussed at theprevious Meeting of the Cabinet.The Cabinet were informed that at a Meeting ofthe Cabinet Committee on the King&apos;s Speeches, heldat noon on November 8, 1934, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs had told the Committeethat, since the Cabinet had decided that he should announce the contemplated United Kingdom. Inquiryin the Debate that afternoon, he had given thequestion his most careful consideration and had come to the conclusion, that there were grave objections to such an announcement being made.In particular, it would, in his view, be most difficult, if not Impossible, to draft satisfactoryterms of reference which would preclude any posai-bility of a roving or fishing Inquiry.    The cabinet were also informed that, while the Cabinet Committeedrecognised that the offer of the contemplated inquiry would assist the Government in the Debate and thatthe Inquiry itself would be valuable from the pointof view of educating public opinion, they had.accepted, the view of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and had accordingly agreed that no reference should be made to the proposed United.Kingdom Inquiry in the opening speech of the government&apos;s spokesman in the Debate.The view was expressed that the offer of an inquiry would have made no difference in the Debate,-22-
which had shown that the only kind of Inquiry whichwould, have satisfied the critics of the Governmentwas a roving Inquiry such as it had been decided inany event to resist.    On the other hand, it was urged that the offe^ of an Inquiry would have beenadvantageous, from the political point   of view, inthe country, and that it might still be found neces-sary to&quot; offer such an Inquiry in order to appeasea very general feeling of anxiety among the Govern-roent*s supporters in the constituencies.The suggestion was made that the best solution might be for&apos;the United. Kingdom representatives atGeneva to make a statement regarding the Government&apos;determination to press for international Conventionsdealing with publicity of national, defence expenditure and for the control and regulation of the trade in,and manufactu.re of, arms .After some further discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note of the circumstances inwhich it had been decided to vary theConclusion reached by the Cabinet attheir Meeting on November ?, 1934,relating to what the Government wereprepared to do in regard to theproposed United Kingdom Inquiry(Cabinet 39 (34), Conclusion 1(f)).(b) To take note that the question of theinstructions to the British representa-tives at the forthcoming Meeting of the bureau of the Disarmament Conference atGeneva would be considered by the ministerial Committee on Disarmamentat their Meeting on the following day,and that the Report of that Committee:would be placed on the Cabinet agenda for the Meeting on November 21, 1934.S* Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 14, 1934.
APPENDIX I.Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.November 16, 1934.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,THE murder of the former Austrian Chancellor in July, and the assassinations of the King of Yugoslavia and of M. Barthou in October, profoundlyshocked the world and evoked the deep sympathy of Myself and all My People.These tragedies undoubtedly caused a serious setback to movements then on footfor European appeasement, and I have therefore noted with satisfaction theuntiring efforts which My Government have made in many directions to counselmoderation and promote more friendly relations between nations.In continuation of the conversations which took place last summer, repre-sentatives of My Government are at present engaged in preliminary discussions with representatives of the Governments of the United States and Japan in preparation for the Naval Conference, which is due to take place next year. Itis My earnest hope that their efforts may be attended with success, in order thatthe world may be spared the evil of unrestricted competition in naval armamentsso effectively averted in recent years by the international engagements freelyentered into by the parties concerned.Two of My sons have been able to make visits during the present year to Mydominions overseas. The welcome which the Duke of Kent received during his recent visit to South Africa and that given to the Duke of Gloucester first in ceylon and then in Australia have been a source of great pleasure to the queen and Myself.An Act has been passed making fresh provision for the administration of new foundland in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commissionon Newfoundland. A Commission of Government has been set up and will, I trust, succeed in restoring prosperity to the Island.The Joint Committee of both your Houses, after patiently and assiduouslyexamining the problem of the future government of India, have concluded their task, and their recommendations will shortly be before you. Seldom, if ever,has an enquiry covered a wider or a more important field, and I do not doubtthat your Committee have discharged their duty in a manner worthy of thetask entrusted to them.Members of the House of Commons,I thank you for the provision you have made for the public service.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,Notwithstanding the continuance of difficult conditions affecting inter-national trade, the purchasing and saving power of My People has been strengthened and the national finances have so far improved as to justiiy asubstantial alleviation of the burdens which were accepted three years ago.The continued improvement in trade and employment among My Peoplegives me great satisfaction. I am especially pleased at the welcome expansion in the export trade of this country, which has been materially assisted by thetrade agreements which have been concluded with a number of foreign States,and by the development of trade within the Empire on the basis of mutualpreference.10764
I regret that unhappily some areas have not shared in this improvement andtheir special conditions are receiving the sympathetic attention of My Ministers,I have given My assent to a Bill providing for the amendment of theunemployment insurance scheme and for the establishment of a system ofunemployment assistance on a national basis.Bills have received My assent providing for the amendment of the law relating to betting and gambling, for the prevention of incitement to disaffection,and for regulating the hours of employment of young persons in the distributive trades.Measures have also been passed for meeting the situation arising from thelong continued drought, and for assisting the livestock and dairy sections of theagricultural industry.Bills relating to Scotland have received My assent providing for the acceleration of the provision of small holdings, for the suppression of illegaltrawling, and for the amendment of the Poor Law.A number of other Measures of public utility have been passed into law.I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
APPENDIX II.Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.November 20, 1934.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.The maintenance of world peace does not cease to give My Government themost anxious concern.
