The Cabinet had before them a T-Tote by theMinister   of Labour (C.P.-232 (34)) suggesting that, in view of the urgency of the matter, theDraft Regulations of the Unemployment assistance board should, be referred at onee to a Cabinet Com-mittee for detailed examination and. report.The suggestion was made that the UnemploymentInsurance Policy Committee, which had prepared theUnemployment Assistance Scheme in 1933, would be an appropriate body to consider the Draft regulations in question.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Cabinet Committee should beappointed to examine and. report uponthe Draft Regulations of the Uneraploy-ment Assistance Board:(b) That the composition of the Committeeshould be settled by the Prime Ministerand should follow the lines of the composition of the Unemployment InsurancePolicy Committee of the Cabinet.(NOTE:   The composition of the UnemploymentInsurance Policy Committee was as follows the Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Secretary of State for Home Affairs,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,The Minister of Labour,The First Commissioner of Works.Since the matter was discussed in cabinet the Prime Minister hasinvited the above-named. Ministers,with the addition of the Postmaster-General, to be the Cabinet Committeeto examine and report on the draft regulations of the unemployment assistance Board.)

With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had before them a Note bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  (CP.-234(34)) covering a Memorandum prepared in the ForeignOffice to show in some detail the present state ofdeliberations at the Disarmament Conference.   Themain points for consideration by the Cabinet appearedto the Secretary of State to be the foilowing&quot;(l) The prospect of securing at the present time a Disarmament Convention, i,e., a world-wideagreement limiting and reducing by number and definition the maximum armaments ofevery country in the world, does not exist.(2) Although this melancholy fact is everywhererecognised, the formal admission by theConference that it cannot attain its objectmight have serious additional consequences.For example, article 8 of the Covenantrequires that plans should be formulatedfor the reduction of armaments, etc.If it were conceded that no plans could be formulated, that would be a direct denial of the Covenant.   Consequently, some modeof postponement in the hope of trying againlater on would be of practical utility.Again, the conclusion of the DisarmamentConference without result might leadGermany to disavow Part V of the Treatyof Versailles in terms, alleging that sheaccepted and is bound by the limitationsin her own armaments only so long as the effort to reduee the armaments of othersis being carried through.   Whether Germany&apos;sopen avowal of her disregard of a treaty which she is not observing would make(3)matters worse may be in question, but itwould certainly create a new situation.Cannot some much more limited objective bereached and something saved from the wreck?Even if this cannot be done, i am strongly of opinion that we should attempt it. Draftconventions for publicity of national defence expenditure and for the control and regula-tion of the trade in and manufacture ofarms may not result in actual achievement,but it would, make a great difference, ithink, to our own position if we preparedsuch drafts and. pressed them forward, and showed that,  just as we gave the lead atthe beginning of the Conference, so we havenot abandoned such practical effort as ispossible at the end of it.There is no time to lose, for it is probablethat Mr Henderson willmeeting next month,&quot;itask for a Bureau
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs thought that while it was clear that there was no immediate prospect of securing a Disarmament convention-tion, the results of saying so publicly might bevery serious, having regard both to the commitmentsunder Article 8 of the Covenant and to the probability that Germany would repudiate Part V of the Treaty ofVersailles .   There was a large and growing number ofpersons who, in the circumstances, were disposed tothink that germany&apos;s re-armament was justifiableas well as inevit ab1e.In these difficult conditions there was much tobe said for striving for a more limited objective in the direction of Conventions covering publicityof national defence expenditure and the control and regulation of the trade in and manufacture of armsbringing the practice of other countries into conformity with the practice of the United Kingdom.The Lord- Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that theInt er-JDepartmental Committee on Trading in Arms would,he hoped, complete their labours that afternoon.The Inter-D epartmenta1 Committee had prepared aDraft Convention on the subject, but that convention would not, in certain respects, go so far as theDraft Convention which had. been considered at Geneva in June last.   The main point of difference wasthat the United Kingdom draft contained no provisionfor the publication, in the case of important ordersfor war material, of data such as numbers and prices .The Geneva Convention, on the other hand,, had. made -such provision,, but at the time our represent at iveehad objected to it on the ground that there wgtg no.by private firms.    In both
III AGE OPINFORMATION.Previouspferenc e:j&amp;tinet 20JM), Oon-pLusion 3 *)If we brought- forward, a Draft Convention relatingto these matters there was some risk that we might beasked at Geneva to agree to the meeting of otherD is armament Commit tees:    for ex ample, the 0 ommitteedealing with Aviation.    Finally there remained the difficult question of Germany, which might&apos; be expectedto refuse to concur in any Convention unless herdemand for equality of rights was first conceded.Having regard to the difficulties to which he had referred, the Lord Privy Seal suggested that- it mightbe better, before taking any definite action at Geneva,to attempt to carry the diplomatic discussions a stepfurther, notably with France and Italy.In the course of discussion, reference was made toleakages in the Press to the effect that the Governmentwere contemplating the production at Geneva of aDraft Convention on the lines suggested in G,P.-234(34).    In this connection reference was also made towhat appeared to be a serious leakage of confidential information in regard to new types of bombing aero-planes .The view was expressed that the time might havearrived when we should invite France to say what sheproposed to do if the Disarmament Conference finallybroke down, pointing out that we ourselves had proposed scheme after scheme with the object of saving theConference.    It was very necessary, if possible, to compel France to face up to her responsibilities inthe matter.As regards the Draft Convention it seemed very desirable, both from the point of view of Geneva andfrom, that of public opinion at home, that any new proposals we now made should, not be of a more limitedcharacter than those contained in the draft geneva convention of June last.
The Cabinet agreed   .(a) That the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on trading in Arms should be circulated tothe Cabinet as soon as practicable:(b) That this Report should be placed,on the Agenda Paper for the Meetingof the Cabinet on Wednesday, October31st.-5-
jurr private^FtejFAC^URFg; arm?.line to &quot;betaken inParliament.previous; Reference:Cabinet 36(34), Con-ELusion 4?b))3. With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet considered the line to betaken in Parliament in the event, as seemed probable,of the Opposition moving a Vote of Censure in regard,to the question of the private trade in. and manu-factiire of, arms .   The suggestion was made that ifwe entered, upon diplomatic discussions with theFrench on this matter the;/ might ask that nothing should be said in Parliament on the subject duringthose discussions.    It was generally agreed, however,that our reply should be to the effect that theGovernment could not be placed in a very difficult position in the House of Commons because of thepossibility that a Debate might be embarrassing tothe French Government.-In the course of discussion emphasis was laid onthe strong and growing feeling throughout the country against private profits being made out of the manufac-ture of weapons which in some cases might be used against our own people. While no doubt this view was based on sentimental considerations, it was none theless a very real and powerful one, and it was allthe more important, therefore, that any new proposalswhich we now decided to make should be at least asfar-reaching as the proposals which had been considered at Geneva. &apos; It was suggested, on the other hand, thatthe Government had a very good and convincing answer,based on our own record and on our system of regulationNo other.country was imposing regulations, e.g.,relating to the export of munitions of war, or, ifthey had such regulations, they were not carryingthem out.   Public opinion was very ill-informed onthe subject, and this aspect of the question had never been really explained.
A proposal was made that, when the case for. theGovernment was put, the following among other points should he made:-(l) That this is an international questionwhich cannot he dealt with by each nation separately.(.2) That our regulations are much stricterand the enforcement of them, much more efficient than is the ease in otherc countries .(3) That the private manufacture of armsis necessary and cannot be abolished     ;Vwithout very great harm being done joThis/^le^tt-er proposition would, no doubt, bedistasteful to many people, and must be fully justified, by pointing out that if the private manufacture of arms were abolished, State factorieswould have to be greatly increased in manber andsize, not merely to deal with peacetime requirementsbut to be ready for enormous expansion of output inwartime.   Moreover, the prohibition of the private manufacture of arms-would be highly detrimental tothe smaller Powers, as it would place them in aposition of hopeless inferiority to the larger Powers,which were in a position to maintain their own Statefactories aIt was further suggested that in any public statement it should be explained that every possible step was taken to prevent officials from interestingthemselves, directly or indirectly, in the armament industry.   There was considerable misconception ofthe position on this subject in many quarters.Doubts were expressed whether the general publicwere much concerned with this aspect of the question,and it was suggested that the point usually taken wasthat so long as private profits could be made out ofthe manufacture of arms the ind/ustries concerned would have a direct interest in fomenting
international quarrels and disturbances.   The bestanswer to this contention would, be that the remedylay not in prohibiting the private manufacture ofarms, but in some other way, such as a world-widesystem of prohibition of export of arms and munitionsIn this connection the view was expressed that Itmight be possible to include in the United KingdomDraft Convention a. provision to the effect that inthe event of hostilities between two countries theCouncil of the League of Nations might meet and consider the advisability of rec oilmen ding to allcountries the immediate imposition of an embargo onthe export of arms and munitions to the contendingo ount r ies *ffoe Cabinet acreed _-(a) To invite the Lord Privy Seal tohave regard to the discussion in cabinet on this subject whensettling the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on trading in Arms :(b) To ad.iou.rn further consideration ofthe question of the line to be takenin the Parliamentary Debate untilthe Meeting of the Cabinet onWednesday, October 31st:(c) That there should be placed on theAgenda Paper of the Meeting of theCabinet on October 31st the questionof the spokesmen for the Governmentin the Debate.
k-he PRIVATEliANUPAGTUEB16P ARMS.nswers toparliamentarylauestions.Hpreylous&apos;peference:Cabinet 36  (34)Conclusion 4).4.    The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to aPrivate Notice Question by Mr. George Hall, M.P.,asking the First Lord of the Admiralty &quot;whether he proposed to take any action arising out of the letterreported to have been written by the managing director of Messrs. Armstrong Yifhitworth in which reference was made to a friend in the Admiralty whowould help to get the firm a contract for submarines.&quot;, The First Lord of the Admiralty read to theCabinet a letter dated the 19th September, 1934, whiehhe had received from Sir Charles Craven, managing director of Vickers-Armstrong Limited and also the reply which he, the First Lord, had recently sent toSir Charles Craven.      (For the text of these letterssee theAppendix to these Conclusions).It was pointed out that the phrase referredto in Mr0 Hall&apos;s question occurred in the first paragraph of the letter dated 7th October, 1927,from Sir Charles Craven to Mr, L.Y, Spear and quoted in Sir Charles&apos;  letter to the First Lord.      Theremark in question read as follows:&quot;I also think that perhaps it would be worth while putting forward a tender for six Boats, the total number to be built.I have had a word with the Director of contracts at the Admiralty, who is a friend of mine, and who would like this.      HeI know tried to get us the tender for allfive Submarines last year.&quot;The First Lord informed the Cabinet that hehad made a most exhaustive investigation into these allegations,. a-aA-ha^^efi^e*^^&amp; **J &amp;gi&amp;r?m&amp; i&amp;^^ There was no truthwhatever in the suggestions made.       As regards thetender for six Submarines, the Director of Contractshad pointed out at the time that it would be more economical to give the order for all six to one firmbut that he did not recommend the adoption of this
course as it was desirable to spread the work amongseveral firms in order to help to keep them in being.There was also no justification whatever for thesuggestion that the Director of Contracts had tried to get Vickers the order for all five Submarines in1926.General agreement was expressed with the viewthat the answer to be given to Mr. George Hallshould deal only with the suggestions quoted aboveconcerning the Director of Contracts and that itshould not deal with the question of the &quot;faked&quot;Armstrong tender which was an entirely separateone, as this would involve the publication of thewhole correspondence which it was ftighly undesirableshould be published.It was suggested that the answer to be givenby the First Lord should be to the effect that on receiving Sir Charles Craven&apos;s letter he had takenimmediate steps to ascertain in the most exhaustivemanner whether there was any substance whateverin the suggestions made, that having done so he was completely satisfied that there was no foundation for the suggestions, and that Sir Charles Cravenhad now admitted that he had been entirely mistakenand had apologised for the language which he had usedin his letter to Mr. Spear.        In the event of theFirst Lord being pressed with supplementary questions,he suggested that he should offer an enquiry by some independent person into the whole matter.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the First Lord of the admiralty should reply to Mr. George Hall&apos;question on the lines indicated in thediscussion.(b) That the actual text of the reply shouldbe prepared by the First Lord in consulta-tion with the Secretary of State for Warand the Secretary of State for theColonies.

Copies of the draft report-in question were handed round at the meeting and were subsequently recovered by the actingSecretary as the document was not yet in itsfinally approved form.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained to the Cabinet the trend of the Anglo-Japanese discussions to date as set out in theDraft Report..       After summarising the Japanese&quot;plan&quot; he informed the Cabinet that this &quot;plan&quot;was open to objection inter alia because while under it the naval strengthof the United Kingdom would be fixed at the &quot;commonupper limit&quot;, other countries, including of courseJapan, would be free to build up to that limit.The Japanese delegation had conveyed theimpression that their &quot;plan&quot; was actuated not against us but against the United States.      indeed they had stated that Japan was quite willing thatthe United Kingdom should have a stronger Navythan herself, but they were not willing that theUnited States should have a stronger Navy thanJapan.      This, of course,, gave rise to an almostinsoluble problem in as much as the United Statesinsisted on naval parity with ourselves.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsalso explained to the Cabinet the Japanese views in regard to offensive and defensive vessels, andtheir claim in certain events to 120,000 tons of submarines,  or 60 Submarines of 2,000 tons each.This was the maximum tonnage allowed for Submarinesunder the Washington Treaty and would enable these
Submarines to have an unlimited range of operations.Speaking generally it was clear that in putting forward these proposals Japan was actuated by (l)prestige, and (S) fear of the United States of America.The summary on the concluding pages of theReport would have to be redrafted.      Up to thepresent the United Kingdom delegation had been engaged in elucidating the Japanese proposals andhad made no concession of any kind.      The UnitedStates delegation had nothing whatever to complainabout and a meeting between United Kingdom and UnitedStates representatives was taking place that afternoon.The Cabinet took note of the present positionof the Anglo-Japanese Naval discussions as explained in the. Draft Report in question.Copies of this Report in final form will be circulated to the Cabinet in due course.

With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet were informed by thePresident of the Board of Trade that he had that morning received a message from Sir frederick leith-Ross to the effect that an agreement withthe German Government had been concluded subjectto the settlement of certain technical outstanding points.The Cabinet took note of this communication.

APPENDIX.Copy of correspondence between the PirstLord of the Admiralty and Commander sir charles Craven of Messrs, Viewers-ArmstrongsLimited.VICKERS HOUSE,BROADWAY,WESTMINSTER,S.W.1.19th September, 1934.The Rt. Hon.  Sir Bolton M. Eyres Monsell,(%   Tl   if. \T   the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty, S.W.I.Dear Pirst Lord,I em venturing to trouble you with this letter because i feel that some explanation is due to you from me in connectionwith the reports that have appeared in the Press of certainevidence given at the Enquiry into the Armament industrynow being held at Washington.These reports allege that a letter written by mein 1917 to Mr. L.Y.  Spear, Vice-president of the ElectricBoat Company of America, and produced before the Committeeof the U.s.  Senate, contained the following passage:-&quot;We have received invitations from the admiralty for one, two or three Submarines.     ArmstrongWhitworth has, too.      Armstrong will put intheir bid.    Whatever the price, I shall tellArmstrong to put the price slightly above oursso that whatever is built will be built byBarrow.My friend at the Admiralty will help us, as hetried to get all five Submarines for us lastyear&quot;.You have no doubt noticed that, on the strength ofthese words ascribed to me, suggestions of improperrelations existing between Armament firms, and of collusionbetween Contractors and Admiralty officials have been madein certain quarters..I should like, therefore, to explain that, apartfrom a mis-statement of the date of my letter to Mr. Spear,which was written &quot;not in 1917 but on the 7th October 1927,the passage in question has been seriously misquoted, and given -without its context.      The letter was written onthe eve of the conclusion of the agreement for the amalgamation of Vickers and Armstrongs(which agreement was actually signed on the 31st October 1927) and what I actually wrote to Mr.Spear was as follows t-
7th October, 1927.L.Y.  Spear j, Esq. ,Electric Boat Company,Groton, Conn. U.S.A.My dear Spear,By the time this letter reaches you it is possiblethat we may have come to an arrangement with Armstrongswhereby a new Company is formed to take over the shipbuilding and armament sides of Vickers and Armstrongs.    The termsare such that the new Company will be run by Vickers.    Thisopens up an interesting question regarding our agreementwith you, and it would be necessary to have a discussion whennext we meet.      In the meantime, however, we have just received an enquiry for one, two or three Boats for theAdmiralty.    Armstrong-Whitworths have also received asimilar enquiry.    My present feeling is that we should quotefor one, two or three from Ami&apos;strongs, who have agreed toput in whatever price I tell them, and that we should alsoquote,for one, two or three boats from Barrow.    I would-keep the Armstrong price very slightly above ours, theidea being that whatever Boats were ordered from either party would be built at Barrow, so effecting considerableeconomies.     I also think that perhaps it would be worthwhile putting forward a tender for- six Boats, the totalnumber to be built.    I have had a word &quot;with the Directorof Contracts at the Admiralty, who is a friend of mine, andwho would like this.    He, I know, tried to get us the order for all five Submarines last year.Whatever happens will you give me authority to makethe same reduction in your Royalty as we did last year?According to my pocket book we reserved for you  9^000 forone,  7,200 for each of two,  5,600 for each of three, 4,375 for each of four, and  3,600 for each of five, andI suggest to you that we should put in  3,200 for each of six.I do not know if I have made the matter as clear as Ishould.    At the moment the two Firms are not combining in anyway, and therefore, if negotiations break down, ArmstrongWhitworths -will, of course, be free from us, but the tendershave not to be in until the middle of November,  so we should certainly know one way or another before then.     Needless tosay we do not want anything to come out about the proposedfusion until it is all clear, and I am just sending you this letter so that you can think over the situation.&quot;As regards the general tenor of these remarks, youwill see that I was expressing my opinion that as the Dickers-Armstrong agreement appeared to be on the point of conclusion,-under which it was intended that all submarine-building oythe new combined firm should be concentrated at Barrow owingto the greatly superior facilities there - no good^purpose would be served by Armstrong putting forward a seriouscompetitive tender.      I think that the Admiralty will agreethat, m the circumstances then existing, that opinion was quite intelligible.M ABSOLUTELY PERSONAL &amp; CONFIDENTIAL.
My letter distinctly pointed out that If theproposed amalgamation did not materialise, Armstrongs would naturally be free to put in whatever tender they pleased.I desire, however, to express my great regret thatthe particular reference which I made to the Director of contracts should have been made, even in a personal and confidential letter to a man I had known for over 22 years -realising, as I do on reflection, that it could be read astending to discredit the impartiality of an Admiralty officialwho is universally respected and trusted.I was, of cour se, well aware from my own experiencewhen serving at the Admiralty that the decision in matters ofsuch importance rests entirely with the Board, and that itwould not be within the power of the Director of Contracts, orany other Head of a Department, to bring about a decision infavour of a particular Contractor.     A reference to the con-text of my letter makes it perfectly clear that in expressingmy surmise that the Director of Contracts had some leaning infavour of ordering all the submarines from one Contractor, I took it for granted that he would have been actuated not byany partiality towards any particular firm, but solely by the probability of its being the most economical arrangement forthe Admiralty to make.I think my letter to Mr. Spear will make it quite clear to you that my main Object in v^riting to him was to effect a reduction in the amount of Royalty that my company were entitled to pay to the Electric Boat Company under anAgreement of long standing, so reducing our prices for thevessels.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    0.1.  CRAVES,
Admiralty,Whitehall,  S.W.1.October, 1934.Dear Sir Charles Craven,Thank you for your letter of the 19th September.It was obvious to the Admiralty that the statement attributed to you could not have been written in 1917, as at that date,owing to war conditions, all warship building in contract yardswas on a ;,time and line&quot; basis.      I am glad to have a copy ofwhat you actually wrote in 1927, and I can quite understand theawkward position in which you were placed when the Vickers-Armstrong merger was on the point of completion, and when youfelt that no good purpose would be served by Armstrongs puttingin a serious competitive tender, and so perhaps receiving a contract which under the merger arrangement would be executedat Barrow.I am also glad to receive your apology for yourunfortunately worded reference to  the Director of  Contracts.I share your regret that it was ever made, for it was capableof an interpretation utterly   at variance with the truth.In allocating shipbuilding orders, the Admiralty are,  of necessity, guided chiefly by the prices tendered,  though such considerations as the experience and capacity of the variousfirms and also the desirability of preventing monopoly and maintaining an adequate field upon which the Department can rely, are given weight.    I had already, before receiving your letter, examined carefully the files relating to the tenders for submarines in 1926 and 1927,and had satisfied myself thatthe allocation in each year had been considered carefully andwithout bias, from these points of view, and had been finally decided by the First Lord himself on the advice of the tworesponsible Members of the Board, namely the Controller and theParliamentary Secretary of the Admiralty.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) B. EYRES MONSELLir Sir Charles Craven,-B.E., R.N.
