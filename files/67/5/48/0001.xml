1 QfeCRET. COPY NO.      xotfr April, 1940. A R   CABINET.NEGOTIATIONS TO SECURE THE USE OF ADDITIONALNORWEGIAN TANKERS.Memorandum by Minister of Shipping.1.    In accordance v/ith the conclusions of the War Cabinet attheir meeting of the 14th March, on the proposals submitted bythe late Minister of Shipping in his Memorandum of the11th March (7/.P.(G)(40) 75) for securing the use of additionalNorwegian tankers, a representative of the Ministry of Shippingvisited Norway and has now returned to report.2.    The present position is as follows:-Of the 245 Norwegian tankers in existence, 144 arechartered or nominated under the Shipping Agreement.The further information now available as to the commitments of the remaining 101 vessels indicates that thetotal number of additional tankers potentially available forthe purpose of our negotiations by the end of the year must betaken at about 35 to 40, not 50 as had been thought when thequestion was last reported to the Cabinet.It is important to us to obtain these tankers, but weshall experience difficulty in doing so, since the reluctance of the Norwegians is increased both by greater pressure fromGermany and by their desire to keep a number of tankers trading in the free market in order to substantiate their claim to alarge increase in the rates on vessels already chartered ornominated under our Shipping Agreement.The Shipping Agreement specifies a basic rate of 16/- perton deadweight per month, but provides that either side may askfor a reconsideration of this rate after six months, which means that such a reconsideration may be claimed next month:      the

basis of any change - e.g. whether a change in costs or inmarket rates - is not defined.The market rate - which is largely artificial owing to thesmall number of free tankers - has risen to about 30/-, whereas the costs to owners have not substantially increased.    It isbelieved that the owners are likely to ask for an increase toabout 24/-, which in the circumstances we should considerexcessive.The Norwegian Government has an interest in an increaseof rates in view of the vital importance to the Norwegian economy of the earnings of ships and the taxation on shipping earnings.3.    In these circumstances we are unlikely to achieve asatisfactory conclusion of our negotiations, either as to additional tonnage or the maintenance of reasonable rates onvessels now coming to us, except by a combination of inducementsand of pressure.The means at our disposal are these:-(a) We might be prepared to increase the basic rate of hirefor tankers to, say, 20/-   a   month, if we can secureadditional tankers and if the rates can be stabilised atthis rate (for both the present and additional tankers inour service) at least to the end of 1940, and if possibletill the 31st March, 1941.(b) We might exempt all ships trading with Norway from callingat Kirkwall.   A representative of the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare is in Norway to negotiate such anarrangement.   But the conditions of exemption are not likely to be very acceptable to the Norwegian Governmentand if, as is probable,  similar concessions are made simultaneously to Sweden, the negotiating lever is not a powerful one.(c) The War Office state that they cannot offer to supplyanti-aircraft or field guns to Norway;    nor are we meeting

Norway&apos;s request for assistance in securing 100aeroplane engines in the U.S.A.    The Norwegian government wish, however, to obtain fighter aeroplanes and would apparently accept Gladiators:    if it is possible tosupply some of this type, the concession might prove asubstantial inducement.Negotiators would need to know the maximum number of aircraft which could be offered, but would be instructed tomake the best bargain possible and not to offer the fullnumber unless it were essential to do so in order to secure a satisfactory agreement.(d)   As regards means of pressure, the most important is providedby the dependence of Norway upon our coal and coke exports.We have undertaken in the War Trade Agreement to maintainso far as possible our normal supplies.    Recent supplieslargely exceed this quantity, however, and we could reduce our exports substantially without breach of agreement.The normal supplies amount to about 1^ million tons ofcoal and -g- million tons of coke per annum, representingabout 70^o of Norway&apos;s imports.    Since the outbreak of war,however, we have been supplying at the rate of about million tons of coal a year, while supplies of coke havebeen rather more than maintained.The prices at which the coal has been supplied f.o.b.have only been slightly increased since before the war -they are in fact the same as for supplies to United Kingdomconsumers - whereas, even on the present basis, we arepaying for the tankers rates which are more than twice as high as the best rates in recent pre-war years, withspecial allowance for increased war costs in addition.It would, however, be difficult to increase the priceof coal differentially against Norway at short notice inview of the various Treaty engagements in force.

3 0 5We are, however, at once entitled to point out to norway the privilege she has been enjoying in obtainingcoal at these fixed and low rates in quantities largely in excess of our engagements;    and that unless the norwegians meet us reasonably with regard to the provisionof tonnage and the rates of hire for all the vessels whichare being time-chartered to us, the United KingdomGovernment would obviously have to consider whether theycould continue to supply coal, under the above conditions,in anything like the quantities recently furnished.(This paragraph has been written in agreement with the mine s Department).4. Meanwhile, the authority of the War Cabinet is requestedfor sending representatives to Norway to open negotiations onthe lines proposed in paragraph 3QR.H.MINISTRY OP SHIPPING.5th April, 1940.
