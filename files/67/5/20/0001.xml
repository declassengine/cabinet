Itappeared to them impossible to justify the continuance of thepresent arrangements under which quota restrictions are placedon the amount of cotton exports from Empire countries and Egyptwhile no similar restrictions are placed on the amount ofcotton shipped from the U.S.A.  to these destinations.      TheCommittee were informed that no serious objections were to beanticipated from the U.S.A., especially from the american cotton exporter, who would probably prefer a  system which enabledthem to ship a definite quantity and relieved them of muchof the -present uncertainty regarding their shipments.The Committee agreed that these restrictions on cotton imports should be introduced where possible through negotiationswith the Governments concerned, but they thought it important that these negotiations should be conducted as expeditiouslyas possible.&apos;   They endorsed the view that Cabinet sanction&quot; Annex I

should he obtained fop forcibly rationing cotton imports intothe countries concerned,  with the exception of Italy, if thenegotiations do not lead to an agreement.      In the case of Italy,it was pointed out that forcible rationing, apart from political difficulties, is really unnecessary in present circumstanceswhen Italy holds only one or two month&apos;s stocks of cotton.A note by the Attorney-General on the subject of forciblerationing is also attached,&quot; from which it appears that provided the. rationing figure is reasonably calculated, there would bea sufficient basis for detaining excess shipments and puttingthem into Prize, pending inquiries, oven it if were inadvisable to ask for condemnation.      This should prove a sufficientsanction for the purposes in view.The Committee therefore propose that the War Cabinet -should be recoaaaended to agree that the Ministry of economic warfare should be authorised to take the necessary action to restrict cotton imports into neutral countries contiguousto Germany, by means of agreement with the countries concerned,if possible, and by forcible rationing,  if no agreement ispossible.(Signed)    P.W.

The present arrangements are not onlyinadequate, but are also such as have given rise tole^ i tima t e ccmplaint.2, There are at present two completely differentsystems of control in force,      For Empire cotton and egyptian cotton there is a system of export licences,and exports to &quot;oangerous destinations&apos;&apos; are restricted to normal amounts.      Cotton from other destinations, how-ever,  including berth and South American cotton, is notsubjected to export quotas.      It is treated by our contraband Controls in exactly the same way as othergoods from, say, America,      A consignment may fromtime to time be seized if there is evidence that it may ultimately reach Germany, but provided that there is nothing- known against the consignor or the consignee; andthat guarantees against re-export are forthcoming,  it maybe assumed that consignments of American cotton, howeverlarge and liouever e:i io:::,:v-rs such shipments may be, arereleased by our Contraband Controls, and allowed &quot;to proceed

18    &quot;7 or 8 months5l oro125* The American cotton exporters have already beensounded by the British Embassy in .Washington, and theirattitude, as recorder.; iii Washington telegrams ITos 74 and 713. It is important to recognise that, under present arrangements, there is nothing to stop the warehouses ofEurope bulging with American cotton provided that con-signor and consignee are beyond reproach,    and suitableguarantees are f ortkco-ing,,     The Blacl; List system maycheck one or two isolated consignments, but has little effect upon the total shipment- effected to dangerousdestinations.      The navicert system is not tvc present used to checE the volume of neutral trade to &quot;dangerousdestinations&quot;, for the Contraband Committee have decidedthat navicerts shall not be refused merely on statisticalgrounds,  except as part of a general policy which wouldequally refuse export licences, and cause actual ship-ments ma&apos;:e to be detained or seized.4. It is clearly most   undesirable to allow ;l dangerousdestinations&quot; to accumulate vast stocks of american cotton.      Already the figures for Hungary; Norway, Sweden,Holland and. Switzerland are lar^e enough to cause us conce\while the potential arrivals as shown by navicert appli-cations are large.      The stocks to-day; estimated in termsof normal months&apos; consumption^, are believed to be approxi-mately as follows:-Hungary 5 months.Yugoslavia 2      11NorwaySwedenDenmarkItalyBelgiumHollandSwitzerland

any idea of quotas for United States exports of cotton.If there are to he quotas;  these must he quotas for the importing country and&apos; not for the United States.      Theythink that the allied Governments ought to fix the quota for an importing country, whether or not in agreement withthe Government in question.      The Washington telegram pro-ceeas to   suggest that permits to import would then he ob-tained by the buyers,, suoh permits being either issued orendorsed by an aliieo authority;    the shipper would satisfyhimself before accepting an order,, that the buyer had ob-tained his permit and the shipper could then go aheadconfident that the consignment would pass tho Controls.6. The American shippers are on the whole uissatisfiedwith the oresent system, even though it gives themsuch opportunities to sell American cotton in Europe.Their complaint is that some of their shipments have in the past been seised because we had objections tothe consignees;,  when  they had been unaware that theconsignees in question were on our Slack List.      the consequent uncertainty, they feel, is unfair to them,and we ought to take them more into our confidence and give them sufficient indications of our attitude to enable them to comply with our wishes.      Inorder to avoid trouble, some of the importantshippers have sent us lists of their sales, askingus to indicate to which consignees we have objections.In some cases these lists have been for goods already on the way to Blade List consignees, and they have asked that if v/e object to the names they nay beallowed to switch over the cotton to acceptable

&quot;buyers.     Such requests as this seem very reasonable to business men, and v/hen we refuse them theycreate trouble in Washington.7. It is, however, the Egyptian exporterswho feel that they are being most unfairlytreated by present arrangements.     They lenow that american cotton is being allowed through ourControls in more or less unlimited quantities to enter the European neutral countries.      they see that we are not enforcing in the caseof American cotton the drastic restrictions which we are imposing on Egyptian cotton.     Atthe present moment v/e are granting only 25,--of the applications received from &quot;dangerousdestinations&quot; for Egyptian cotton.      Sir M. Lampsonreports that the matter is likely to become animportant political issue in Egypt, and thatit is absolutely essential to take steps asa matter of urgency to meet this grievance.It is true that the Egyptian cotton trade has been doing very well during the war.The United Kingdom,  India, Canada and Prancehave been buying large quantities of eygptian cotton, and the Egyptians have thus sold,&quot;between 1st September and 27th December, 133.;,greater quantities of cotton at higher pricesthan during the corresponding period in1930. Sir Mc Lampson   has   suggested

that we might try to meet this Egyptian criticism of our control by purchasing some special grades ofcotton in compensation for the restrictions which weare imposing.      But whether or not this is done thegrievance remains that we are treating american cotton and Egyptian cotton on a different basis, to egypt&apos;s disadvantage,, and it seems likely that this situation must be remedied or there will be politicaltrouble.8. If Egyptian cotton and American cotton have tobe treated in the same way, there are two ways inwhich this might be done.      In the first place, we might relax the severity of our restrictions on theexport of Egyptian cotton;    but this should if possiblebe avoided, since the only result v/ill be to increasethe already swollen stocks accumulated in thoseneutral countries which are regarded as &quot;dangerousdestinations&quot;.      Secondly., and preferably, we canendeavour to restrict more effectively the imports of american cotton to those &quot;dangerous destinations&quot;.A suggested scheme of control*9. In the circumstances described above, it isclear that we shall be obliged, whether we like it ornot, to institute some new arrangements.      It isdesirable that these arrangements should not be madepiecemeal but should take the form of a comprehensive scheme covering the whole problem,      Such a comprehensive scheme should, if possible, be based onthe following principles(a) The accumulation of excessive stocks in neutral countries adjoining Germany shouldbe prevented,,

(b) Egyptian cotton and American cotton shouldhe treated on the same basis, so that thereshall be no grounds for complaint by the egyptians that American cotton is being less strictly controlled than Egyptian cotton.(c) The grievances of the American shippersagainst the &quot;uncertainty&quot; of the presentsystem should be met so far as possible.(d) We should try to take the cotton trade into our confidence, and endeavour to work our control with their co-operation, and withoutforfeiting their goodwill.10. The best scheme, had it been practicable, wouldhave been an arrangement with the American shippers bywhich they would have agreed with us to form a centralisedexporting association and voluntarily to restricttheir exports to maximum quotas acceptable to us. - Wehave now ascertained that such a scheme of export quotasis impracticable, owing to the attitude of the Americanshippers as explained in Washington telegrams Nos. 7hand 75   (see Appendix) e11.  .      As, therefore, we must abandon the idea of limiting American cotton exports at the producing end,we shall have to consider the alternative of limit ingcotton, imports at the consuming end.     Can v/e rationthe imports of cotton into those European neutralsto which Germany has access?       The American shippersrecommend that v/e should seek a solution of the problemen these linos &apos;.soo /4&amp;xsatlix)?  and their recommendation isendorsed by Lord Lothian.    Before deciding, however, to

Aadopt such, a scheme, we must see how It would helikely to work out in practice, and make up our mindswhether we are prepared to face the difficulties involved.12. A scheme for limiting cotton imports to theneutral countries to which Germany has access would haveto take the position in the following countries intoaccount:-(a) S/wederu   we have obtained under the War trade agreement a prohibition of re-export, and the swedes have communicated to us their import programme for 1940, which we have approved.(b) N^rwayA   A &quot;far Trade Agreement is under negotiation, which accepts a form of ration-ing and guarantees against re-export.(c) Baltic States..     Shipments are being held upby our Contraband authorities on administrative and other pretexts.      A rationing agreement isunder consideration for all three States,together with Government guarantees againstre-export.(d) Denmarl^   A voluntary quota is being negotiatedas part of a War Trade Agreement, and there isa Government prohibition of re-export saveunder licence.     We are assured that suchlicences will not be issued for Germany.(e) Hjolland..y No quota is contemplated under theWar Trade Agreement, but, while discussionsfor such an agreement are proceeding, the dutch government have prohibited the export of cottonto enemy destination.

(f) Belgium.    A special Agreement has he en negotiated(hut not vet signed) specifying the amount of exportperriiccible.    No limitation has hem placed on imports.(g) SvijfczcrJLc.ncl. A War Trade   Agreement is under negotiation under which it is hoped to prohrbit theexport of raw cotton and cotton yarns to Germany,and to restrict the export of tissues.    Nolimitation has been placed on imports, out the Swisshave given us figures of their requirements for 1940.which we consider far too high.(h) Italy.    *.7e have accepted in principle the Italianoffer of a State guarantee against re-export, but our acceptance was made conditional on a general settlement of outstanding questions, and it is nowdoubtful whether such a settlement can be secured.The Free Port of   Trieste is a very difficult p-obi era(i) Hungary.    A rationing agreement and re-exportguarantee have - ecu agreed in principle, but anagreement on the details will probably not be easilyreachedo(3) Yugoslavia. A tentative scheme is under discussion,but no re-export gur nteee has been given.(?-) Ro.umgni.a.,   No proposals for an agreement have beenput forward,  and there is no Government guarantee against re-export.(l) Bulgaria.   No proposals for an agreement have beenput forward.    Bulgaria prohibited the exportof cotton in August, 1939, &quot;-ut as a resultof subsequent arrangements it is not clear that

this prohibition remains in force0(m) Greece?    A   &apos;ar Trade Agreement has beenreached which accepts rationing in principle.There is also a Government guarantee against re-export,.13.       It will he seen that, of the countries mentionedabove, some have concluded war Trade Agreements with us and others have note      Some have already acceptedrationing in principle while others have not; and some have given us guarantees against re-export while others have not.     The position differs in fact in almost every country.      In some countries it may he possibleto negotiate with an association of cotton importers,whilst in others it will be impossible to obtain our requirements in this way,     V/e cannot, therefore,suggest some cut and dried procedure, which will be suitable for each of the countries mentioned above.-  Steps have, however, been taken to work out a statistical basis for a rationing scheme for allcountries mentioned above,      These figures will show the import quotas which would be suitable in the caseof each of these countries,15.       It is suggested that, as soon as these figures are available, we might approach the Governmentsconcerned,  taking in each case the line which wouldappear most appropriate, but in each case in thehope of arranging an import quota on the basis of ourrationing figures.      To some Governments v/e would propose that they should reach an agreement with us,fixing a cotton import quota as proposed, and that theyshould then give us full details of each shipment with

the names of the consignees, and v/e on our side wouldguarantee to pass it through our Contraband Controlswithout question, provided that the shipment was within the agreed quota and the consignee was not undersuspicion of trading with the enemy.      To otherGovernments we might suggest that they should set up a central agency with whom we could deal and whom :/ecould trust, and our discussions about the quota wotildthen proceed with this Central agency or Cottonassociation rather than with the Goveru;ent0      To someother Governments (e,go Belgium and Holland) we mightpoint out the danger to themselves of accumulating large stocks of cotton, when Germany is suffering from an acute shortage, and we might ash them if they wereprepared to operate their own cotton control viz,  to limit imports, and to prevent stocks from accumulatingabove a certain level.16.        -.7e should endeavour in each coise to reach anarrangement on global quotas covering all growths ofcotton.     That is to say, we could leave it entirely tothe importing country to decide how much American cotton,how much Egyptian cotton, and how much Empire cotton, itrequired within the quota.      Any attempt to forceconsuming countries to agree to buy from particularproducing countries would be open to serious objection.17.       It is essential, however, to realise that if weattempt to introduce such a scheme ox&quot; co&quot;i -von importquotas, we must be prepared,  if all else fails, to imposeforcible rationing in certain cases.      If one or more of the Governments concerned prove to be unreasonable,and refuse to come to any agreement, forcible rationing

nay be the only possible course.-    It has long ago been laid down that, before forcible rationing can be imposed,Cabinet approval must be sought.      It follows, therefore,that, before deciding to introduce any such scheme o\fimport rationing for cotton, we shall have to obtainCabinet approval for forcible rationing in case of need.If the Cabinet are not prepared to authorise forciblerationing in any circumstances, it will be forconsideration whether it is worth while making anyattempt to put such a rationing scheme into force.18.       An exception can, however, be made in the case ofItaly,      It is evident that there would be the strongestpolitical objections to an attempt to impose forciblerationing on Italy in&quot; present circui:stances.      Italyv/ill in practice have to be treated exceptionallyunder the scheme now suggested, not because her cotton imports are less important than those of the other neutral countries concerned, but merely because it wouldhe too dangerous -to try to impose effective limits on herimports, and we already know that she will not beprepared to agree to such a limitation.      -./e- shall therefore be obliged to content ourselves with theItalian Government&apos;s offered guarantee against re-export,if that can still be secured.     This means that we shallhave to allow unlimited amounts of American and Egyptian(and presumably also Empire) cotton to enter Italy, atleast so long as the Italian Government observe theirguarantee.Objections to foregoing scheme,19.       There are admittedly certain objections to theforegoing scheme which would have to be carefully

weighed, &quot;before any decision were taken to adopt it.In the first place, there is the difficulty thatquick results cannot he expected from a procedureinvolving an approach to a dozen or more differentGovernments, and Involving discussions with them on apoint where many of them may well be reluctant to meet our views.     V/e&apos; can hardly hope to bring all theGovernments concerned into line within two or threeweeks;    and it will probably be found that, even if our negotiations proceed satisfactorily, there will stillafter some months be some countries with whom no agreement has been reached.      o&apos;e shall have to decide whether we intend to bring the new scheme into forcein respect of each countvy as and when it reachesagreement with xis,  in which case the Governmentsconcerned, realising that procrastination on their partis likely to be to their advantage, may prefer not to conclude an agreement with ois.      Alternatively we might decide to fix a time limit, and impose cottonquotas from some particular date, whether agreement hasbeen reached or not;    bixt the disadvantage of thiscourse is that, when the date comes for imposing quotasupon the neutrals concerned,  it will be very obvious thatwe are not attempting to impose forcible rationing inthe case of Italy.20.-       Another difficulty is that we have alreadybeen conducting war trade negotiations with many of thecountries concerned, and while in come cases we have got the rationing principle accepted, in the case of othercountries there is what amounts to an understanding that we

shall not require them to conclude rationing agreements with us, and that we shall he content with their under-taking not to re-export goods to germany      If we askthose countries now to agree to ration their cotton imports, they will think that we are going hack on what we have hitherto said in our war trade negotiationsc      Ifwe go further, and impose forcible rationing on countries with whom we have negotiated War Trade Agreements withoutany provision for a limitation of imports, those countries might immediately denounce the Agreements.21.       Thirdly, objections may be advanced on the score ofthe difficulties of forcible rationing.      It will beremembered that the Prize Court may refuse to condemn onstatistical evidence aloneo     It is practicable to acertain extent to detain goods for a time, or to seizethem but to allow the ensuing discussions to result intheir release before any Prize Court proceedings takeplace;    and although such a policy can hardly be pursuedindefinitely, the Prize Court decisions of the last wargive ground for thinking that it could be pursued for aconsiderable time, long enough to produce the desiredeffect.     Even if cases are taken to the Prize Court but no condemnation results, damages will not- be awardedagainst the Crown where the statistical case is adequate.Moreover, forcible rationing was carried out in the last war in some cases,&quot; and it should therefore prove possibleto overcome difficulties which were not found insuperablein 1916/1917.      Finally, the purely legal difficulties will disappear when the gradual extension and consolidationK &quot;Sweden was, therefore, rationed, notwithstanding that the Swedish authorities refused to sign a rationing agreement&apos;1 (Bell.    Blockade ofGermany, page 526 )Q

of the navicert system enables rationing to be controlledat the source by the grant or refusal of navicerts coupled with the refusal of shipowners to carry (and of navicertedcargo owners to ship their goods on a vessel carrying)unnavicerted cargoo     By this system all Prize Courtdifficulties are avoided.22..      A fourth objection is the ill-feeling which such a rationing policy may be expected to arouse in certain quarters^      Every attempt to restrict trade must alwaysarouse some criticism, somewhere, and if v/e are going to try to impose any restrictions at all on cotton shipments,we must expect such criticismo      On the whole, there is no special reason to suppose that the scheme under considera-tion is likely to arouse dangerous opposition.      So far asthe United States of America&apos;s interests are concerned,the farmers will of course strongly dislike any restriction on the sale of American cotton, and every attempt on our part to prevent cotton from going to Europe in dangerousquantities will evoke hostile criticism in the SouthernStates.      On the other hand, U.S.A.  shippers will have no special cause to complain, as the scheme proposed is onewhich they themselves have advocated, and they willprobably support rationing provided that it is carried outon reasonable lines which can be fully and franklyexplained to them with a view to obtaining their co-operation.     The Egyptians should be relieved to see thatthey are going to be treated in future on exactly the same basis as the Americans0     The rationed countries will certainly raise objections if the ration has to be imposed on them forcibly, but here again it should be possible toexplain and justify our policy in such a way as to showthat we are not unmindful of their legitimate interests.

Care will have, of course, to he taken that the quotasallocated to thera are in fact sufficient for theirreasonable needso     Moreover, where there are existingWar Trade Agreements it will be necessary to have regardto the terms of the Agreements in fixing the quotas0The alternatiye .23.        Objections can, of course, be raised to every lineof policy.      It may be v/ell to set for oh here, for purposesof comparison, one alternative which has recently been proposed.      Sir Mo Lamp son*  in his telegram No&apos;-c75 to theForeign Office of 3rd February, states his opinion thatthe best course, if v/e are to retain Egypt5s whole-hearted-operation in control, is to aim at replacing the quota system in Egypt by a system of supply only to spinners in neutral countries who can be relied on themselves to use the cotton they buy and not to sell to Germany,      Indeed,if it were decided to continue to allow American shipments to proceed to dangerous destinations without more checksthan are exercised at present, it would presumably benecessary henceforward to allow Egyptian cotton also toenter neutral countries to an equally generous extent,provided that we have nothing against the consignees,This v/ould mean that Egyptian cotton as well as american cotton would henceforward flow into the stocks held in theneutral countries concerned;    and for that reason alone theobjections to such a course would seem greatly to outweigh the objections to the scheme proposed in the previousparagraphs of this memorandumoSummary,24.        In brief, the position may perhaps be summarised asfollows:-Cotton is of the greatest importance to Germany for

war purposes, and. there is known to oe a serious shortage in that country.      It is desirable to prevent unduly large stocks from accumulating in the neutral countries to which germany has accesso      Our present system of control is inadequate to prevent this, so far as American cotton isconcerned.     The very fact that we have hitherto been ableto impose a stricter control on Egyptian cotton is havingserious policical reactions in Egypt0     We are not in aposition to place such restrictions on American cotton atthe exporting endo     We should therefore now seriouslyconsider introducing import restrictions on cotton enter-ing countries to which Germany has accessa       We should try to do this by agreement with the Governments concerned,but should obtain Cabinet sanction to impose forciblerationing on those countries, with the exception of Italy,if it proves impossible to do so in agreement with them.ministry of Economic Warfare20th February, 1940,

They stressed the highly competitive nature of the cotton export business,and were insistent that it be maintained.      They specificallysaid, for instance, that it would be impossible to run thebusiness on cartel lines.      Proposals outlined in yourtelegram No.  77 would therefore be unacceptable to them.The unanimous view was that,  control beinginevitable,  it must be exercised in the importing countryand not in the United States,      The quota for any country should^   they thought, be fixed by the Allied Governments,whether or not in agreement with the Governments inquestion, and permits to import obtained by the buyers,such permits being e ither issued or endorsed by an Alliedauthority.      Before accepting an order,  the shipper wouldthen satisfy himself that the buyer had obtained his permitand the shipper could then go ahead, confident that consign-ment would pass the controls^     No other suggested line ofaction commended itself to the meetings

Exporters view the principle-of quotassympathetically, and at least one said that he was preparednot to object even if quotas were low.     Extremely lowquotas might however have serious repercussions owing to political influence of cotton-growing interests.      Itwas therefore important, whatever the level at whichquotas were fixody  that they should be supported by fullexplanatory details and reasons in justification.      It was argued^ that owing to the disappearance of manufacturerssupplied from Germany, quotas must be higher than therecent average of imports into countries rationed.     this argument was however not stressed so hardly as the point,to which gr^at importance seemed to be attached, thatcotton quotas must not be divided up amongst variousexporting countries.      These should be left free to compete for licenced orders available,That exporters were unaware of the serious situation was apparent at the second meeting when reportsof the seizures on s.sc Vasaholm had reached them.      the news coincided with the end of a heavy day&apos;s business^exporters were obviously very nervous about theircommitments.     They said, that the Navicert System, by itself,  did not meet their requirements as, owing to thenature of the markets,  deals had to be clinched at once and the result of Navicert applications could not beawaited before doing so.      They accordingly suggested,  asa temporary expedient and pending the working-out of a quota system as proposed by them, consignmentsunacceptable to contraband control should be allowedto proceed to their dostinations against guarantees byshippers that they would not be released without the approvalof the local British Consul0The French Ambassador has been fully informed of theproceedings, and record of the meetings follow by air mail,

There is noreason to doubt their benevolence but the nature of their business is traditionally cut-throat and only time and experience will, I fear,  induce them to modify their attitude.I hope, however,  that alternative procedure suggested may be practicable and,  if so,  that Global quotasmay be fixed without delay.      In the interval adoption of expediency suggested in penultimate paragraph would,  ifacceptable,  ease the situation greatly.      This is the moredesirable as nearly all consignments are at shippers riskand on a cash on arrival basis0As you know cotton plays a predominant part in the economy of this country.      I therefore tnink that we should goas far as possible to avoid a vehement outcry which might seriously affect public opinion here.      To some extent the fault would be with shippers themselves who have selling andconsigning freedom without much regard to ultimate destinationbut telegram from Texas Association repeated in my immediately following telegram is symptomatic of what we may expect.

In the long view the most serious danger will arise from a combination of disgruntled lobbies in Congressrepresenting damaged interests,  for instance, cotton,tobacco,  fruit and so on,  combining to put pressure on theadministration to insist on relaxation of our war contraband control.      Anything you can do to show appreciation ofstrictly American producers,  and above all to limit(? condemnations will be valuable,.

FORCIBLE RATIONING.NOTE BY THE AT TORNEY-general.I have had an opportunity of considering various draftsand memoranda prepared by the Ministry of Economic Warfareon (l) The Control of Cotton Imports, (2) Seizures in Prizeon Statistical Grounds, (3) The Legal Position in regard toRationing a Neutral with whom there is a War Trade agreement and (h) War Trade Agreements and Contraband Control.      I havealso had an opportunity of discussing the legal issues raised with the Procurator General and representatives of his Department,and with the Legal Advisers of the Foreign Office and the Ministryof Economic Warfare.     The most important legal question thatemerges is whether under international law there would be a sufficiently effective sanction for forcible rationing, if this were sought to be imposed on some country which would not agreeto a rationing scheme.      I understand that before forciblerationing can be imposed, Cabinet approval must be sought*Although the Ministry of Economic Warfare do not contemplateproceeding to forcible rationing forthwith, they are doubtfulwhether it would be worth while attempting to proceed with the rationing scheme which they have under consideration unless theyhad authority in the background to impose forcible rationingagainst any country which would not by agreement come into thescheme.      It is in these circumstances that the legal issueformulated above has become of importance.In seekinVJ to enforce forcible rationing it would haveto be shown in the first instance that the ration figurecovered the internal needs of the country and legitimate trade,if any, with other neutral countries, and also stocks reasonablyheld or required under existing war conditions.     Assuming this

could be done, we would certainly have a basis for maintainingto the neutral that any excess over the ration figure would beregarded by us as prima facie evidence that the commodity wasfinding its way through that neutral country to the enemy.     if however one assumes only a comparatively small excess over the ration figure, it could not be suggested that there wouldbe any chance of getting condemnation of the cargo whichconstituted the excess by the Prize Court on the statisticalevidence alone.      The Prize Court would be concerned withthe particular cargo and the inference which could reasonably be drawn from the statistical evidence.     Assuming that the excess was only 5 per cent., the evidence would show only 1chance in 20 that that particular cargo was destined for theenemy.      If the excess becomes substantial the inference of enemy destination becomes proportionately easier and, short ofactual condemnation, more clearly justifies detaining and putting the goods in Prize pending inquiries.     As there would almost certainly be other circumstances on one side or the other itwould be academic to seek to determine with any degree ofexactness the percentage which might, in the absence of allother evidence, be regarded by the Court as justifyingcondemnat ion.It therefore must be accepted that a quota fixed forforcible rationing could not be rigidly enforced by seekingand obtaining condemnation of all cargoes in excess of the quotain the Prize Court.     I do not however think that the possibilityof resorting to forcible rationing should be ruled out on theground of the difficulty and uncertainty of the ultimate sanction of condemnation.     Administrative action short of seekingcondemnation could properly be taken.      In cases where therewas some ground for suspicion the Court would be unlikely,certainly in the early stages, to mulct the Crown in damages.

?even though it refused to condemn;    the area being one in whichthe principles so far laid down do not clearly point to oneresult or another on any particular set of facts.     There is always the possibility of reinforcing the statistical evidenceby other evidence, and if a country exceeded its quota onsuccessive occasions without putting forward any reason thereis the ultimate chance of condemnation on statistical evidencealone.The memoranda also analysed the legal issues which may arise in this area from the fact that there is a War trade agreement between the Crown and the neutral country which has exceeded its forcible ration figure.     I agree with this analysisand the general conclusions drawn from it.     Each case, should it arise, will turn on the particular facts relating to the excess cargo as well as on the terms, and possibly the pastworking, of the &quot;War Trade Agreement.     On this part of the subject do not think I could usefully add anything at this stage.D.B.  SOM.33RVELL.LAW OFFICERS1  DEPARTMENT.19th February, 19h0.
