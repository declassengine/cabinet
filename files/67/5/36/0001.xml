SUGGESTED ANGLO-FRENCH DECLARATION NOT TO CONCLUDE ASEPARATE PEACE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues for their consideration a memorandum onthe suggested Anglo-French declaration not to conclude a separate peace. Mycolleagues will see that the late French Government were believed to be strongly infavour of proceeding with the declaration. It will be recalled that there were difficulties in the way of including the Dominions in the declaration and thatthe Secretary of State for the Dominions saw serious objection to its limitation to the United Kingdom alone. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris, who is strongly in favour of the declaration, has suggested that its value would beincreased if it were expanded to cover future financial and economic co-operation,and it seems possible that, as the Dominions are not parties to the Anglo-Frenchfinancial agreement of the 4th December last, such an addition might help tocircumvent the difficulty that has arisen about their inclusion in the declaration.The Secretary of State for the Dominions has asked the DominionGovernments for their views about this new suggestion. The replies of all four governments are expected by this evening and, as I am anxious to get mycolleagues&apos; approval of the proposals before the holidays, I am now circulatingthis paper.H.Foreign Office, March 19, 1940.Memorandum on the suggested Anglo-French Declaration not to conclude a Separate Peace.AT the Fourth Meeting of the Supreme War Council on the 20th December,1939, M. Daladier agreed in informal discussion with the Prime Minister that france and Great Britain neither would nor could make a separate peace, and supported the proposal for issuing a joint Anglo-French declaration to this effect,which he thought would, at the appropriate moment, be of psychological value and would counter German propaganda designed to drive a wedge between theAllies.2. It was agreed that we should prepare a draft for further consideration,and the following text was submitted to the Dominion Governments and theGovernment of India, as it was felt that the Dominions should be given anopportunity of associating themselves with the declaration : &quot; The   under-signed,   duly  authorised   thereto  by   their   respective governments, hereby declare as follows : The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain andNorthern Ireland and the Government of the French Republic mutuallyundertake that during the present war they will neither negotiate norconclude an armistice or treaty of peace, except by mutual agreement.&quot;10924   [20966]Printed for the War Cabinet.   Ma,rch 1940.SECRET. Copy No. 13W.P. (G.) (40) 86.TO, BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY..   It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.
The replies received from the Dominion Governments show, however, thatit will not be possible to associate them with the proposed declaration. The NewZealand Government wished to be associated with it and the commonwealth government were in favour if all the other Dominions agreed. The UnionGovernment, however, hesitated to join on account of the attitude of theOpposition in South Africa, and the Canadian Government were unwilling toparticipate as they feared that this might arouse internal controversy in viewof the imminent general election.3. It is clearly undesirable that the proposed declaration should coversome but not all of the Dominions, and it follows that the declaration, if made,will have to be limited on our side to the United Kingdom. The Secretary ofState for the Dominions has, however, suggested that this course is also open to serious objection, since it is bound to provoke speculation as to the attitude ofthe Dominions and might afford material for enemy propaganda.4. The matter has been referred to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris, whowas instructed to explain the position frankly to the French Government andenquire what were in their view the relative merits of proceeding with thedeclaration as between the French Government and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom alone, or of dropping the whole idea in view of thedifficulty over the Dominions. Sir R. Campbell has found that the first reaction ofthe Quai d&apos;Orsay is emphatically in favour of going ahead with the declaration,notwithstanding the non-participation of the Dominions. He has not, however,yet received M. Daladier&apos;s final opinion.5. Sir R. Campbell is himself strongly in favour of the declaration fromthe point of view of Anglo-French relations. He considers that it would impose a solemn and binding obligation upon all future French Governments, which,even if they might not be as sound from our point of view as M. Daladier&apos;sGovernment, would find it virtually impossible publicly to repudiate an engagement of this kind. Moreover, if made at an early date, the declaration would, he feels, weaken the position of such elements in France as may be workingwith a view to forming a Government more inclined to seek an early peace withGermany.6. Sir R. Campbell suggests, however, that the proposed text of thedeclaration might be expanded so as to give some contractual form to the con-ti nuance of Anglo-French economic and military collaboration after the end ofthe war. He feels that, in addition to the good effect of such a furtherdeclaration upon the outside world, it would be an immense encouragement to theFrench and would assist Anglo-French relations when the time comes to arrangeterms of peace, by dissipating French suspicions as to the future attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government after the defeat of German.7. There is much to commend Sir R. Campbell&apos;s suggestion. Apart fromthe arguments which he has himself advanced, an addition to the proposed declaration in the sense he suggests might help to circumvent the difficulty aboutthe Dominions. The Dominions are not parties to the Anglo-French financial agreement of the 4th December last, or to the economic arrangements now in forcebetween the two countries; and if the proposed new declaration were expanded to cover future financial and economic co-operation, it would appear more normal and logical that it should be simply between the United Kingdom and France.The suggested supplementary paragraph might take the form of a declarationof intention, and the following wording would, I think, be suitable :  &quot; The two Governments further declare their intention to continue the closest co-operation in their financial, economic and defence policy after theconclusion of peace.&quot;Foreign Office, March 19, 1940.
