cPrinted for the War Cabinet: March 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 82.   (Revise.)(Also Paper P.T.S. 110.)March 30, 1940.WAR CABINET.DIVERSION OF SHIPPING.(Previous Paper W.P. (G.) (40) 57.)Report by Minister of Transport.BY W.M. (40), 56th Conclusions, Minute 3 (confirmed by W.M. (40),60th Conclusions, Minute 2 (v)), it was agreed that a Report should be presented to the War Cabinet before the end of March on the plans and arrangements fordealing with a major diversion of shipping.2. I am very grateful to the Minister for the Co-ordination of defence for meeting the Permanent Heads of the several Departments concerned and forthe assistance he has given in securing decisions on the various outstanding points which were under discussion and to which I referred in my memorandum .P. (G.) (40) 57 of the 22nd February.3. In the last few weeks the plans and arrangements have been exhaustivelyre-examined by the Standing Committee of the Port and Transit Organisation,and the substance of this Report has been agreed by the Departmental repre-sentatives on that Committee.Action already taken.4. Attached (Appendix I) is a copy of instructions sent on the 7th march to the Port Emergency Committees at all the principal commercial ports inGreat Britain. Although these Committees must in each case form the keystoneof the arch of responsibility for securing the maximum use of the ports which remain open, a number of other Departments and emergency organisations haveresponsibilities for giving them every assistance.The following summarises the action taken by the Departments primarily concerned :-Ministry of Food.5. Instructions have been issued to Port Food Movement Officers that, on receipt of a warning telegram, they must take all necessary action to put the diversion plans into operation immediately. They also have explicit instructionsto take any steps necessary on their own initiative to clear consignments of foodstuffs from the ports, whether or not they have specific instructions aboutthose consignments and whether the goods are controlled or not. Specialauthority has also been given to the Port Food Movement Officers to provide thenecessary indemnity to Customs Officers and others in cases where the clearance of cargoes is likely to be delayed owing to the absence of the appropriatedocuments. In addition, arrangements have been made to eliminate delays in the clearance of the ports (such as might be caused by the necessity of sorting[21061] B
consignments to marks or by sorting in some other way) by transferring suchconsignments to stations or depots away from the ports where this work can be performed.Ministry of Supply.6. The existing arrangements of the Ministry of Supply for the reception of raw materials at the ports and for their despatch to proper destinationsprovide for the use of the ordinary trade channels acting under central control:these arrangements have worked well since the outbreak of war. To meet heavydiversion and the dislocation of communications, the Ministry&apos;s proposals for strengthening the existing arrangements are described in Appendix II; those proposals relate to raw materials covered by the various Controls or othercentralised arrangements. The Ministry has not found it possible to extend thearrangements to the relatively small proportion (about 5 per cent.) of goods not so covered, but they can be dealt with under the existing powers of the PortEmergency Committees to remove goods at consignee^ expense to inland places of storage to await disposal.Mines Department (Petroleum).7. Owing to the delays to tankers proceeding to East coast ports, and theadditional risks of such voyages, the Petroleum Board have already reduced their imports into that area to a minimum. Distribution from Hull, Jarrowand Grangemouth has been curtailed and areas normally supplied from these ports are now being fed from the Mersey and the Clyde respectively. A schemefor distribution from the West coast, in the event of complete diversion fromthe East coast, has been prepared by the Petroleum Board and can be put intooperation at any time.Customs.8. Arrangements have been made for the rapid transfer of staff as required.Instructions have been issued that, after receipt of a warning telegram, Collectorsare to give every facility for the rapid clearance of goods. Instructions couldbe issued to Collectors to waive Customs examination at the quays and dockswhenever and wherever that was necessary, in time of a major diversion, toensure the rapid dispersal of imports and clearance of the quays. This might,however, involve a loss of revenue, and the Board of Customs and Excise wouldrequire the express authority of the War Cabinet to issue such orders.Ministry of Labour and National Service.9. Machinery for the transfer of dock labour has been in existence since october, 1939, and it is considered that it should work smoothly. The TransferAgreement provides that ports should first endeavour to obtain labour on aday-to-day basis from other ports within daily travelling distance, but it is recognised that in the case of large-scale diversion to the West coast it maybe necessary for ports to apply without delay for men to be transferred fromthe East, and the plans provide for doing so.It is primarily the responsibility of the Local Port Labour Committee toput men in touch with accommodation, but it appears from recent enquiriesthat there is a shortage of lodgings at some of the West coast ports owingto an influx of labour from other areas. Efforts to find suitable accommodationare still proceeding, but the uncertainty as to the nature and extent, of thedemands inevitably presents difficulties. The matter has been referred to theHousing (War Eequirements) Committee to consider what further arrangements may be necessary.A delicate position with regard to transfer which existed in Glasgow, owingto union antipathies, has now been cleared up, and the Minister of Labour reportsthat Glasgow has adopted the transfer agreement.Ministry of Shipping.10. A number of dumb and self-propelled barges have already been sent tolocalities on the West coast and, when the decision to divert shipping is taken,other self-propelled craft will follow to pre-arranged localities to assist in over-side discharge. The arrangements to ensure the availability of coasters for tran-shipment are set out in Appendix III.
A dmiralty.11. The naval authorities at all ports have been instructed that after receiptof a warning telegram they should give all possible help to port authoritiesand shipping in communications, water transport, and in other directions wherethe need becomes apparent.Ministry of Home Security.12. Discussions have been held with the port authorities at Liverpool,Manchester, Glasgow, Bristol, Avonmouth and Cardiff (including Barry,Newport and Swansea) as to the lighting required in the event of diversionin order to secure full use of the docks. The schemes submitted by these authorities have been approved, and arrangements have been made for the workto be put in hand at once as a matter of urgency, with a view to a temporalscheme being completed by Easter. The provision of equipment which is notavailable locally has been arranged through the Admiralty. The expenditure involved will attract grants under the Civil Defence Act at the rate of 85 per cent.In addition, arrangements have been made with the London, Midland and ScottishRailway to undertake the necessary work at their West coast ports which willbe affected by diversion.13. The necessary arrangements have been made with the RailwayCompanies for the additional lighting required at marshalling yards likely to beaffected.Ministry of Transport Docks and Harbours.14. Under the Civil Defence Act, 1939, grants have been made to port authorities principally on the West coast for the provision of additional facilities at the docks to enable additional traffic to be handled. The estimatedcost of these schemes is well in excess of  1 million; the major works are dockextensions at Avonmouth and Glasgow, increased oiling facilities at Avonmouth,Swansea and Stanlow, and the provision of additional cranes at a number of ports. Work is progressing satisfactorily, but, owing to its magnitude in somecases completion cannot be expected for 12-18 months.15. Grants have likewise been made to port authorities towards the cost ofspecial measures to ensure due functioning of the undertaking in the event of air raids. These measures are in the main of the nature of protection to vital points and key personnel, and the provision of necessary spares, &amp;c. The estimated costof these works is  1,100,000.16. In addition to works actually on the dock estate, improved railway facilities (e.g., marshalling yards) have been provided at a number of placesinland, which will result in quicker clearance of goods from the ports.Moreover, the War Office have made special arrangements to provide additional facilities at certain ports now used by them, which will have the effect of freeingcertain commercial berths.Penalty Rents on Government Property.17. In paragraph 11 (vii) of W.P. (G.) (40) 57, I informed the War Cabinetthat I was discussing with the Treasury the possibility of extending penalty rents,now leviable on private property to Government property which may be causingcongestion on the quays or in the transit sheds. The Treasury have maintained their opposition to the proposal, and I agree that penalty rents by themselves donot secure removal of the goods. A satisfactory arrangement has now been made whereby a Port Emergency Committee, though not authorised to charge penaltyrents, may require the removal of Government property from the quays or transitsheds either to store or to destination and instructions to Port emergency committees have been issued accordingly.Requisitioning.18. The existing plans for securing efficient working of the ports are designed to assist the consignee (whether a Government Department, a controller a private trader) and, if necessary, to bring pressure on him to clear the goods
rapidly to their destinations. The plans are less satisfactory if the consigneefails to claim his goods or if, owing to the absence of papers, import licences, &amp;c,he is unable to establish his title to them. Removal to store in the immediateneighbourhood of the port is only a partial and unsatisfactory solution.It appears, however, that the size of the problem can be over-emphasised;in the case of 90 per cent, of the total volume of imports, the local repre-sentatives at the ports of the Ministries of Food and Supply would be ina position to nominate a final destination and make actual arrangements for transport. Of the remaining 10 per cent, it may be assumed that in most casesthe private importer will be most anxious to secure delivery and will makeexceptional efforts to ascertain the whereabouts of the cargo. In the view of theMinistry of Supply, which is the Department principally concerned with these goods, any proposal to requisition and despatch to destinations which may prove to be inconvenient is likely to cause serious confusion.Having regard to the views of the Ministry of Supply, and to the powers ofthe Port Emergency Committees referred to in paragraph 6 above, I do not thinkit necessary to pursue the matter further.Action in Hand.Storage.19. Apprehension has always been expressed about the extent of storage accomodation for imports. The Office of Works have made an extensive survey of accommodation which might be used in emergency and various departments have earmarked such of this accommodation as they might require. PortEmergency Committees have examined the schedule of premises in relation totheir own neighbourhoods. As regards food-stuffs, the Ministry of Food do not expect in the event of major diversion to have to&apos; use to any appreciable extentpremises which have been earmarked by the Office of Works. The plannedmovements of food-stuffs would normally be to depots and warehouses already in use, and the Minister of Food considers that the residue could readily be accomodated in known railway warehouses, public carrier and other publicwarehouses suitable for the purpose.Transport away from Ports.20. Exact plans for the provision of adequate transport facilities by road,rail, canal and coastwise could no doubt be drawn up if it were known with certainty which ports would be closed for what periods, and the nature anddistribution of the commodities to be handled during those periods.21. These factors are, however, unknown variables; the East coast ports are more vulnerable, but it is not impossible for enemy action to close all orany of the West coast ports. The time and duration of closure must remainunknown. The commodities arriving during those periods will vary widely,depending partly on the convoys which are due and on seasonal fluctuations ofthe types of imports. The distribution of many commodities imported atunaccustomed places, and whence transport inland must inevitably be difficult,will depend on the supply position in various parts of the country at the moment.22. Accordingly, my Department has not hitherto found it practicable to lay down precise plans for transport in a series of assumed circumstances. Thewhole basis on which the present arrangements have been built is that railwayrolling-stock and road vehicles can at very short, notice be sent to those pointswhere the demands for transport are heaviest and that, when the wishes of theconsignees (whether Government Departments or private traders) are known,the necessary arrangements for routeing the laden vehicles to their destinationscan quickly be made. The essence of the arrangements is to secure the maximumdegree of flexibility in normal operation, with the power to strengthenimmediately any points where weakness threatens. For this purpose, I believethat the existing machine in the Ministry of Transport is constructed on soundlines; but modifications and adjustments are constantly made in the light of experience.(The arrangements for the use of coastwise shipping, for which the Ministerof Shipping is responsible, are referred to in Appendix III.)
23. The utility of canals in clearing ports is unfortunately very limited particularly on the West coast but the Regional Canal Committees have beenasked to take action to secure the most effective use of canal transport.24. Notwithstanding the difficulties mentioned in paragraphs 20-22 above,the Ministry of Food have found it practicable to prepare plans in some detailfor the conveyance of certain foodstuffs from the West coast ports to theMidlands and the East coast, should the East coast ports be closed. A plan forgrain is completed, and application for the necessary expenditure is with theTreasury. Similar plans for the distribution of meat and other refrigeratedcargoes, and for oil seeds and feeding stuffs, are in active preparation.25. The circumstances of the Ministry of Supply are in many respectsdifferent. Most of the bulky commodities must be unloaded direct into trucksand the inland transport arrangements must inevitably wait upon knowledge ofthe arrival of ships. As stated in paragraph 6 above, arrangements are beingmade to secure, with regard to practically the whole range of imports of rawmaterials, that inland destinations shall be nominated without delay. In the attempt to complete the picture of the inland transport problem to be envisaged,the Ministry of Supply are preparing a statement dealing with some of its morebulky imports and indicating the rates at which, and the West coast ports through which, particular inland areas should, on supply grounds, be fed with particularmaterials.26. The whole question of planning distribution in advance bristles with difficulties, but a Sub-Committee of the Port and Transit Organisation is collectingsuch data as may be available, and attempting to co-ordinate such plans as canbe devised for the distribution of imports and the movement of goods internally,so that the flexible machine for transport generally may have some indication ofthe work it will be called upon to perform.Conclusion.27. The above are the principal measures taken through the Port and transit Organisation to secure that, in time of a major diversion of shipping, thefullest use is made of the ports which remain open. Much must necessarily depend on the efficiency of the Port Emergency Committees who are my local representatives and to whom visits have been and will continue to be made toensure that they are alive to their responsibilities and aware of their powers and duties. The Committees must, however, have the fullest co-operation and assistance from the representatives of a number of other Departments, and Iwould again express my gratitude to the Minister for the Co-ordination ofDefence and to the others of my colleagues who have been responsible for theaction and plans outlined in this Report.28. Although the plans and arrangements are as complete as in presentcircumstances it is possible to make them, I must emphasise that however completethey may be, a policy of major diversion will inevitably involve serious dislocation of shipping, supply and inland transport. No plans can succeed in avoiding thisdislocation; they are designed to reduce, as far as possible, its effects upon the life of the country. In my opinion, the deterioration that is bound to result froma major diversion can be checked at a certain point though I cannot pretend tosay where that point is from which experience will gradually enable improve-ments to be made. Nevertheless, if diversion continues for many months we are bound to be faced with the need of accepting a reduced rate of import.(Initialled) E. W.Ministry of Transport,March 30, 1940.
APPENDIX I.Section 6a.A Major Diversion of Shipping.613. The notes which follow are not intended to interfere with the present arrangements for port working. The need still remains for Port emergency committees and others to take steps to secure the rapid passage of goods throughthe ports but, in present circumstances, there is little need for exceptional measures which might interfere with normal operation. The need also remainsfor Port Emergency Committees to keep under constant review the arrangements which would be necessary for dealing with a large increase of traffic inparticular, the transport facilities, and in consultation with the CustomsAuthorities the provision of relief places of storage (cf. paragraphs 712-723). Itis most important that as many of the arrangements as possible should be capableof introduction without delay.614. At any time it may be necessary for a major diversion of shipping from a number of ports to be put in hand for an appreciable period. Shortlythereafter it is probable that dock accommodation will not be available for allincoming vessels and a proportion of them will have to lie at anchor in shelteredwaters either to wait their turn to enter a dock or to discharge overside intocoasters or barges (see paragraphs 626-634 below). It is essential that, to postponethis time, the ports which remain open shall stretch their resources to the utmost,keep themselves free of congestion, and handle the maximum amount of additionaltraffic.615. If drastic steps are to be taken sufficiently early, adequate notice of intention to introduce a large scale diversion will be vital. It is hoped to avoid a drift into a policy of diversion and find, after a period of day-to-day diversionin the expectation of opening the closed ports, that the remainder have beenfilled up, and that at an unnecessarily early date vessels are forced to wait.616. It has been agreed that the decision to introduce a policy of majordiversion shall be taken by high authority, in full recognition of the dangers to shipping and of the effect upon the food and supply positions. The para-graphs which follow indicate the lines on which action should be taken byPort Emergency Committees and others when the decision to divert shipping is taken.617. Increasing the resiliency of the ports. When the decision is taken,the Port and Transit Organisation will immediately notify all Port emergency committees. The notification will be by telegram to the Chairman (or other person to whom communications are normally addressed) with the code words&quot; painstaker aggravated,&quot; with the addition &quot;westwards&quot; (meaning thatthe swing would be from the East Coast), or &quot; eastwards &quot; (the swing from theWest Coast), or &quot; generally &quot; (meaning that a number of ports on both coastswere actually, or likely to be, closed).618. The arrangements indicated below are based primarily on a diversionfrom the East Coast to the West (i.e., with the addition &quot; westwards &quot;); this isthe most probable assumption. Should the telegram have the addition&apos;&apos; eastwards &quot; or &quot; generally &apos;&apos; rapid adaptation would be necessary.619. On receipt of the telegram an urgent meeting of the Emergency Com-mittee at ports likely to receive additional vessels should be summoned; to this might be invited, at the discretion of the Chairman, the local representativesof all or any of the Government Departments concerned [e.g., the Senior naval officer, the Collector of Customs, the Port Food Movement Officer, an officerof the Ministry of Supply, an officer of the Ministry of Labour, the Chairmanof the Area Coasting and Short Sea Shipping Control Committee, the regional commissioner, &amp;c). The probable effect of diversion on the port in the lightof current circumstances should be reviewed and all possible measures examined
and put into effect to fit the port to handle a large increase of traffic over an indefinite period. Each Committee should exercise its own discretion, but all or any of the following points should be considered :  (a) clear the quays and transit sheds of goods then occupying them, ifnecessary by the imposition of penalty rents or removal to store; thelocal officers of the Ministries of Food and Supply should be asked toco-operate as regards goods in which they are concerned;(V) review the probable transport requirements and facilities; through theappropriate transport members of the Committee, the machinery for providing additional facilities should be set in motion;(c) apply to the Minister of Transport for the local &quot; Control of traffic at . . . Port Order &quot; (power to require goods to leave the port by adesignated means of transport) : in the event of diversion to the West,this Order would be applied immediately to and without application by (cf. paragraph 809) the Committees at Bristol, Cardiff, Liverpool,Manchester and Glasgow to Committees at other ports on applica-tion; (Notes : i. Paragraph 3 of the Order relates to &quot; goods whichhave been unshipped or are expected to be unshipped &apos;&apos; : the noticecan therefore be served before the goods are actually discharged,ii. When an Order is in operation there should be close co-operationwith the Customs authorities in its exercise);(d) notify the local Joint Committee for Dock Labour or similar body aboutthe possible need for transfer of labour to the port, with a view tothe operation of the Agreement dated 6th October, 1939. In the caseof the principal West Coast ports, steps should be taken to secure thatthere is no shortage of labour, however temporary;(e) bring into effect the modified lighting that has been agreed in consultationwith the Ministry of Home Security to ensure the ports are capableof working to their maximum efficiency;(/) apply for requisition of additional places of storage (see paragraphs712-723);(g) review with the local Customs Authorities any relaxation of customsprocedure on the lines of Appendix D (P.T.S.20);(h) take such other ad hoc measures as may be appropriate to increase the capacity of the port to handle additional vessels and cargoes.620. Throughout the period of pressure, the Committee should ensure thatall concerned in the operation of the port, and in the passage of goods throughthe port, are fully aware of the importance of securing a large and steady flow of goods to their destinations. Any difficulties which are not capable of a localsolution should be immediately reported to the Ministry of Transport. Incertain circumstances the Minister of Transport would be prepared to send anofficer from Headquarters with wide powers to assist the Committee.621. In addition to the steps mentioned in paragraph 619, plans are beingconsidered on the following points : (a) Requisitioning. The responsibility for clearing goods from a port rests with the consignee. The existing plans for securing the efficient working of the ports are designed to assist the consignee and, ifnecessary, to bring financial or other pressure on him to clear hisgoods. The plans are less satisfactory if the consignee fails to claim his goods or if owing to the absence of papers, import licences,etc., he is unable to lay adequate title to them. Removal to store inthe neighbourhood of the port is only a partial and unsatisfactorysolution to this problem. Theoretically the right solution is that thegoods should be requisitioned by some Department with a view toputting them into commission. A solution on these lines bristles with difficulties particularly from the point of view of the CustomsAuthorities.Although the volume of goods concerned is not likely to be largpthe problem remains and the best solution has not yet been found.(b) Customs clearance inland. It is hoped to arrange with the CustomsAuthorities and the Railway Companies for railway depots near theprincipal consuming centres to be used as temporary warehouses or
clearing grounds where Customs clearance can be taken. This should enable certain types of cargo (generally the mixed liner cargo) to beoff-loaded direct into railway trucks (sealed vans would not be insistedupon) and sent to the neighbourhood of their ultimate destination. Itis hoped to furnish a list of the depots shortly.The arrangements under (a) and (b) above are still in the embryonic stage and Port Emergency Committees should take no action on these lines until furtherinformation is given.622.   Simultaneously with the issue of telegrams &apos;&apos; painstaker aggravatedto Port Emergency Committees, notification of the decision to introduce a policyof major diversion will be given to the following Departments :  (a) Ministry of Food and Ministry of Supply to instruct their local officers at the ports to take especial steps to clear consignments in which theyare concerned to their ultimate destination.(b) Customs and Excise Department to transfer staff and to give every facility for the rapid clearance of goods.(c) Ministry of Labour-to ensure that the arrangements for the transferof labour move smoothly.(d) Mines (Petroleum) Department as regards tankers and supplies of oil.(e) Ministry of Shipping (i) to take steps to secure the quick turn round of vessels;(ii) through the Area Coasting and Short Sea Shipping control committee to mobilise available coasters;(iii) to transfer self-propelled barges from the Thames to pre-arranged localities (already notified).(/) Admiralty to instruct Naval Officers-in-Charge and others to make any necessary local arrangements, with a view to expediting the dischargeof merchant vessels (e.g., the release of anchorages, the provision ofcraft, &amp;c).(g) Ministry of Home Security to authorise modified lighting.623. In appropriate cases instructions to local officers have already beengiven by the Departments concerned. The instructions will have effect fromthe receipt of a telegram from that Department, issued at the same time as the telegram &quot; painstaker aggravated.&quot;624. Through the Ministry of Transport immediate instructions will begiven to the Railway Executive Committee to arrange for the concentration of rolling stock and to give special attention to the clearance of the ports; theemergency organisations for road and canal transport will similarly be instructed.625. The Port and Transit Organisation and the Shipping (Diversion)Room will make every effort to direct ships into ports at such a rate as will avoidcongestion arising; they can look confidently to the Port Emergency committees to ensure that the maximum flow through the ports is achieved.626. Overside Discharge. At certain ports principally on the West Coast discussions have taken place as to the anchorages in relatively sheltered watersavailable for merchant shipping which cannot enter a port. If the resiliency inthe ports which remain open can be exploited to the full, it is hoped that thenecessity for vessels to proceed to these anchorages either to wait to enter a port or to discharge overside -will be reduced.627. The ports concerned have already been individually notified of thenumber of dumb and self-propelled barges which will be made available to them,and of the number of vessels which may be expected to discharge direct tocoasters if sufficient of the latter craft are available.628. The decisions as to which large vessels are to wait at an anchorage,or are to be wholly or partly discharged at an anchorage into barges or coasters,will be taken by the Shipping (Diversion) Room after consultation, as necessary,with the Emergency Committee concerned. The shipowner will be notified bythe Ministry of Shipping and it will be the duty of the shipowner to notify the
consignee where delivery will be given. (In the case of goods to government account the Department concerned will receive notification both through theShipping (Diversion) Room and the shipowner.)629. Where possible the cargoes to be selected for discharge into barges orcoasters will be large consignments of bagged or cased goods generally to the account of the Food and Supply Departments, who will arrange for reception anddistribution of the goods through their usual channels. Certain ports haveexpressed willingness to handle certain types of timber overside.630. Unless circumstances make it unavoidable, refrigerated or mixed linercargoes will not be selected for overside discharge; and every effort will be madeto direct vessels carrying bulk grain to any available elevator berths. should it be necessary to discharge a refrigerated, general liner or grain cargo elsewherethan at a quay arrangements with the agents, the consignees and other interests concerned will have to be made on an ad hoc basis.631. At those places where discharge overside in abnormal circumstanceshas been proposed, the appropriate Committee should keep under review thearrangements which would be necessary, especially on such matters as theprobable demand for labour, the provision of stevedoring gear, &amp;c. In the caseof. stevedoring gear, arrangements should be considered for its acquisition orimprovisation.632. At those ports where additional barges have been provided for over-side discharge, steps should be taken to put the craft into commission whenthe telegram &apos;&apos; painstaker aggravated &apos;&apos; is received.633. If any Port Emergency Committee from Southampton westwards to Glasgow (inclusive) is aware of any sheltered anchorage in their neighbourhoodwhere discharge into coasters or barges would be reasonably practicable froma large vessel of approximately 425 ft. in length and 26 ft. in draught; and ifthe anchorage has not been brought to the notice of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee since November 1939, it is requested that particulars may be furnishedso soon as possible to the Port and Transit Organisation.634. The arrangements outlined in paragraphs 626-632 above are intendedsolely to relate to the discharge of vessels in abnormal circumstances. They arenot intended to apply when it is the normal practice of the port to discharge goodsoverside into barges or coasters; in time of diversion the practice should becontinued and, if necessary, accelerated.635. General. Should the enemy compel the closing of a number of ports on either coast of the United Kingdom, the result would be in the nature of a major national peril. Emergency measures of an exceptional character wouldhave to be taken and, so far as Port Emergency Committees are concerned,some of these are indicated in the foregoing paragraphs. The exceptional measures will come into operation with the telegram &quot; painstaker aggra-vated &quot;; if, after the despatch of the telegram, the necessity for closure does notarise, or if the period of the closure is shorter than anticipated, the exceptional measures, which will have involved a certain amount of inconvenience, mustbe regarded as an insurance against risk.636. During the war, and irrespective of diversion, Port Emergency Com-mittees should continue their directive function of securing the rapid passageof goods through the port. The extent of their directions depends on prevailingcircumstances; the telegram &quot;painstaker aggravated&quot; is a warning and instruc-tion that there is urgent need for securing the greatest possible fluidity in the portswhich remain open, and that each Committee&apos;s activities should be directed inconjunction with the local representatives of the other interests concerned, andwho have similar responsibilities, to the taking of all possible measures to cope with a serious emergency measures which might not be justified in mormal times.637. Relaxation. If after the telegram &quot;painstaker aggravated&quot; hasbeen despatched, circumstances make it possible to cease a policy of major diver-sion and to allow a freer use of the closed ports, a telegram will be sent to all PortEmergency Committees with the code words &quot;painstaker relaxed.&quot;[21061]c
APPENDIX II.Proposals of Ministry of Supply.(a) Ministry of Supply Controls and other appropriate organisations areto be instructed to overhaul their machinery at the ports and to satisfy themselves, in the light of the possibilities suggested in the last paragraph, that their organisation is sufficiently flexible to deal withall the emergencies which may be caused by diversion.(h) Controls and parallel organisations already inform the headquarters ofthe Ministry of Supply of the desired ports of discharge for their cargoes, and in some cases the actual inland destinations or areas of consumption are also given. In future, they are to be instructed thatthis additional information is to be given in all cases. The most effective use can thus be made of the technical knowledge at thedisposal of the Shipping (Diversion) Room and the nomination of asuitable port facilitated.(c) At the chief West coastal districts, Ministry of Supply representatives,directly responsible to the headquarters of the Ministry, are to beappointed. Their function will be, not to supersede existing repre-sentatives, but rather to co-ordinate their efforts; in particular, theywill be in a position to act, without delay, in the case of ships whicharrive at ports where there may not be Control or other traderepresentatives. They will also keep in the closest touch with the headquarters of the Ministry, and will be required to act for theMinistry at their own discretion if communication is interrupted.(d) In view of the possibility that telephonic and other communications mightbe interrupted, it is proposed that the Ministry&apos;s port officers shouldbe informed well in advance of all consignments or cargoes expected,at whatever ports, by the Controls or similar organisations. Theywould also be given alternative inland destinations, in order ofpreference, to which cargoes or consignments should be forwarded.This information should enable the representative at the port to actfor the Ministry should vessels, in emergency, arrive at ports wherethey are not expected.APPENDIX III.Coastal Shipping Organisation.1. The Coasting and Short Sea Shipping Control Organisation of theMinistry of Shipping has been planned to deal with unusual conditions withcelerity by providing for a large degree of local initiative and responsibilitythrough Area Control Committees. These Committees act under the general direction of the Ministry.2. Area Control Committees have been established at Leith, Newcastle,Hull, London, Southampton, Cardiff, Liverpool, Glasgow and Belfast. EachCommittee is responsible for the operations of coasting and short sea shipping from the group of ports within its area. There are representatives of the AreaCommittees at the smaller ports.3. Close co-operation is maintained between the Area Control Committeesand the Port Emergency Committees.(a) At the nine control ports a representative of the Area Control Committeeis a member of the Port Emergency Committee.(&amp;) At the other 38 ports where there are Port Emergency Committees, thereis a Coasting and/or Short Sea representative on the Port Emergency Committee.
\4. The method of control of coasting and short sea tonnage is through licensing system. No coasting or short sea voyage can be. undertaken by aBritish ship (of 100 tons gross and upwards) without a licence. To securethe utmost flexibility of operating the rapid movement of coasting and shortsea tonnage, voyage licences are granted locally by the Area Committees underthe general supervision of the Ministry.5. The licensing system has proved fully effective in adjusting the movementof tonnage to meet emergency requirements. In recent months, a substantial volume of tonnage has been transferred from one area to another as required,e.g., to meet the London coal situation.6. For the purpose of meeting the demands of an East to West Coastdiversion of overseas tonnage, it is considered that the licensing system, whichhas the distinct advantage of being in constant operation, can be relied uponto provide tonnage to meet the needs of Port Emergency Committees in so faras the capacity of the coasting fleet is itself sufficient to meet all demands.Should it be necessary, however, coastal tonnage will be requisitioned by theMinister of Shipping under his existing powers.7. The Ministry of Shipping will advise Area Control Committees by telegram and/or telephone when a decision is taken for a major diversion of overseas tonnage.   Area Committees will thereupon take the following steps : (a) Hold all coasting tonnage immediately available either in or bound to theWest Coast reception ports at the disposal of the Port Emergency Committee as may be required. Each Area Committee is informed bydaily reports of the tonnage in and bound to its area. No precisefigures can be given of the disposition of coasting tonnage on an advanced date, but it may be assumed that at least 200 coasters arealways on the West Coast. This tonnage readily available should meetthe demands of the Port Emergency Committees during the first ten days or fortnight of the deviation programme.(&amp;) Divert such additional tonnage then operating on the East and SouthCoasts to West Coast destinations, as may be judged to be necessaryto meet requirements.
