secret copy No. j nW.P. (G) (40) 62WAR CABINETDEPENDANTS&apos; ALLOWANCEMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. My colleagues will be aware that we have had to meet a good deal of criticism in a succession of debates in the House of Commons on the subject of dependants&apos; allowances. In the last debate, which took place just after I assumedmy present office, I gave an undertaking that I would look into the whole scheme, as well as the particular points raised in the debate, to satisfy myselfthat it contained no features which I was not prepared personally to defend.I have since said, in answer to a question, that I hoped to be able to make astatement in the forthcoming debate on Army Estimates, and the Labour Partyare expecting then to have a definite decision on the points which have been raised.2. The broad outlines of the scheme are that a dependants allowance maybe granted to a soldier&apos;s dependant within certain degrees of relationship subjectto the following main conditions:  (a) A net contribution by the man before he joined up of over gs. a week.(6) A household means test.(c) The incapacity of the dependant (except in the case of a widowed mother,separated wife or unmarried wife) for self-support.The allowance is at present at one of three flat rates, 12s., 17s. or 205. 6d.* a week,to which the man contributes at least 7s. The 205. 6d. is confined to certain special cases of dependants with no other means at all.3. Criticism has been generally along the lines that the present scheme hasbeen so tightly drawn that comparatively few applicants can qualifj&apos; for an allowance, and that, where an allowance is granted, the greater part of it is inmost cases found from the man&apos;s pay. Comparisons are drawn with what happened in the last war, at the end of which (after a series of concessions madethroughout the war) the position was reached that allowances were givenpurporting to represent, within a certain maximum, the net contribution of theman before he joined up, without the requirement of any allotment from his payor any means test and, in the case of men between the ages of 18 and 26, allowingparents a flat 5s. a week whether or not their son had earned or contributedanything in the past.4. Our present scheme is based on the principle that allowances shall begiven only where the means of the recipient justify them. I think it is very important to maintain that principle, but I feel that the pressure for some relaxation of the present conditions is so strong that, unless it is met in a sub-stantial way, the present system may be in danger. One of the most criticizedconditions in the scheme is that requiring any applicant to be incapable of self-support. It is represented that this condition is very harsh, e.g., when a man who has been contributing to his elderly fathers support is sent into the Armyand can no longer assist him to the same extent as before. I feel that thei-e isconsiderable force in this criticism.  Even if the father is working, his wage may* The question of adding a higher rate of 24s. is under consideration.Printed for the Cabinet, February, 1940
be such that the family might be eligible for an allowance, if they were not disqualified by this condition. Thus, for example, a man earning 50s. a week, with three or four children and having a moderate rental to pay would come well within the means test, and the household might have been dependent to a substantial extent on the contribution of the son who has joined up: but the father is ineligible for an allowance. It must be remembered that, even if the condition is waived, the means test has still to be satisfied so that to waive the condition would not mean opening the flood-gates to an indefinite number of claims. A test which has been made in certain pay offices suggests that, if the condition were waived, some 20 per cent of applications at present rejected would succeed, but I understand that a test carried out by the Ministry of Pensions, so far as pension cases are concerned, suggests a much smaller figure. It is estimated, on a very rough calculation, that on the basis of the figures obtained from the pay offices the extra cost may be of the order of Â£200,000 a year for each million men serving.

5. I feel that if I can announce a concession on this point, coupled possibly with a modification of one or two other points, which are being discussed departmentally, and on which I hope agreement will shortly be reached, it may be possible to satisfy the more moderate critics. But I am sure that nothing less will be acceptable, and my own view is that this particular condition is one which it is not equitable to maintain.

6. The question has been discussed between the departments, but agreement has not been reached. The Minister of Pensions has, I understand, had the same point under consideration in connection with dependants pensions, and there is considerable pressure on him to waive the condition there also. I should perhaps mention that the incapacity condition was introduced into the Dependants Allowance Regulations, after years of argument, to meet the views of the Ministry of Pensions, who feared repercussions on dependants&apos; pensions where the condition already applied. The view of my department had been that the condition should not apply to dependants&apos; allowances and that there was no reason why the rules governing an allowance to a dependant from whom the man&apos;s contribution was withdrawn temporarily during his service should necessarily be the same as those determining entitlement to a pension for life after his death. It is normal for household circumstances to change on the death of the breadwinner, and the fact that the man himself pays a large share of the dependant&apos;s allowance and is prevented only by his Army service from making his former contribution to his family, seems to differentiate the case of allowance from that of pension.

7. The Minister of Pensions, I understand, contemplates an extension of the definition to admit need arising from "adverse conditions of a prolonged or permanent kind" as well as infirmity or old age. This would admit prolonged or permanent inability to obtain work. The Ministry of Labour, who have also been consulted, have indicated that they would see objection on general political grounds to the omission from our regulations of the condition that the dependant must be not capable of self-support, as they feel that at the present time, when they are about to launch a great campaign for recruitment of additional labour for the war effort, it would be undesirable to make any change which could be interpreted as allowing dependants who were capable of supporting themselves in employment and for whom employment was available to receive a dependant&apos;s allowance. They would, however, see no objection to a modification of the condition to enable an allowance to be paid to an individual who though capable of self-support, is unable to obtain suitable employment. It is suggested that an assurance could be given that the term "suitable employment" would be interpreted in a liberal manner, and that in its interpretation consideration would be given to the point whether the employment had any bearing upon the national war effort.

8. The Treasury view is that the requirement that a dependant should be incapable of self-support is essentially a reasonable one, if modified to admit the case of the dependant who, though capable of self-support, is unable to obtain employment. This modification, it is considered, assumes that the deserving case, particularly that of the elderly parent, is not excluded, while on the other hand no possibility is left that, for example an unmarried sister may be granted an allowance when able to take up employment. Further, the Treasury feel


that the experience of the last war showed that it would be impossible to maintain a distinction in this matter between dependants allowance and pensions, whichwould greatly increase the possible cost of the concession. They also considerthat the main safeguard which would remain, if the concession were made,against the waste of public money would be the means test, and they aredoubtful whether it is advisable to rely solely upon that line of defence.9. I appreciate the arguments both of the Ministry of Labour and of theTreasury, but I cannot feel that those arguments afford a satisfactory explana-tion to the critics of the present scheme of our refusal to admit a claim to any allowance in these cases, especially as these allowances are not large and to asubstantial extent are paid for by the soldier. A limited concession on the lines suggested by the Ministry of Pensions and the Ministry of Labour would not go far to meet the dissatisfaction which exists, and would be administrativelyextremely difficult to work. It might even be necessary to set up appeal tribunals to decide appeals against decisions that applicants were not unable toobtain suitable employment, and each case would have to be constantly watchedto see whether suitable employment had become available. The interpretation of &quot; suitable employment&quot; would, I am sure, present difficulties in practice, and,as the initial decision in each case would rest on the discretion of local representa-tives of the Unemployment Assistance Board, inequalities of treatment wouldbe bound to arise in different parts of the country.10. In order to give a complete picture I have endeavoured to set out fully the views of the other departments concerned, but I hope that my colleagues will agree with me that the wisest course will be to remove the condition altogethernow, instead of waiting until we are forced by the further pressure of opinion todo so, as I feel sure we shall be in the end.O.F.G.S.The War Office,2jth February, 1940.(B40/S) 60 j/40 w.0.1. 4735
