IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS B RITALIN IG MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.GRET.P,,(G)(40) 55.COPY NO.WAR     CABINET.RATE OF IMPORTATION INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM.Memorandum by the Einister of Shipping.In my memorandum W,P.(G)(39) 89, dated 15th November, 1939,it was explained that to attain an import of 47 million tonsof commodities into the United Kingdom from overseas duringthe first year of the war, it would be necessary to achieve anindicated rate of importation, which was estimated to risegradually as we passed from winter to summer weather and as thecontrol over our shipping became more complete.    Actual importsfor the first five months of the war are now known and it maybe interesting to the War Cabinet if I compare the actualfigures with the estimates,    This is done in the following tableThe figures are given in million tons.EstimatedPeriod.Sept.-Oct. 1939 .Nov. 1939 - Jan.1940 .OriginalEstimate5oO m.10o5 m-Feb.-April, 1940(3 months)   ......     12,5 m,May-August,1940(4 months)  ..19.0 m.Hon tn&quot;Iy&quot;rate   of import.2.5 m.3.5 m.4.16 m.4.75 m.ActualActual     monthlyFigures, rate of import.5.6 m.      2.8 m.11.19 m.    3.7 m.I do not expect February, which, apart from the exceptionallybad weather, is a short month, to show any better result thanthe average of the last three months.The rate of import has followed the estimate very closely,although it must be reme-ibered that some of the imports in theearly months represented pre-war shipments of goods not

allowed     for in the reduced programme of war essentials.The later information thus confirms the appreciation which Igave in my memorandum \7.P.(G)(40) 42.    I then pointed out thatthe situation is far too uncertain to make it safe to rely upon the substantially higher rate of import in future monthswhich the achievement of an import of 47 million tons requires,and I hope that the \7ar Cabinet will instruct all departments to comply with my recommendation that &quot;the Departments, in planning their programmes of importation and allocation, should arrange for a consumption on a basis which is less than thatof the provisional figures by at least lO^o.&quot;J.G.Ministry of Shipping.21st February, 194C.
