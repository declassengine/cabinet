0- 103E C R E T.V/.?. (O) (40)65.COPY NO.W,J* CABINET.SHIPPING xiND THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITION.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. While I am reluctant to add to the amount of material v/hichhas been circulated in connection with the shipping situation, Iconsider it essential to emphasise to my colleagues the special importance of exchange considerations in that connection.2. Thus, while I am in ;(.;\. ral agreement with the conclusions reached in the memorandum by the Minister of   Shipping ( 7. P. (&amp;) (40;42) and in the report by the Lord Privy Seal (W.P.(40)64) and while I share the view that a reduction in our import programme is rendered necessary by the state of the balance of trade and of our shipping resources, I must stress that any reduction in our import programme which may be agreed upon should take into full account the foreign exchange position,     A straightforward reduction inthe total of the import programme without regard to the exchange position might very will mean that we were still paying for our imports in a way and to an extent that we cannot afford.     Forexample, shipping considerations favour purchase of wheat from north America at great cost to our exchange   resources, whereaspurchase from Australia is not only more advantageous from thepoint of view of the Budget but can be effected on a sterling-basis.    Similarly, exchange considerations favour purchases of maize from South Africa and sugar from Queensland, whereas we areheing pressed by the Ministry of Shipping to refrain from suchpurchases (or to leave unlifted what we have already bought) andto buy from dollar sources.3. In the same connection I would also mention the growingdiscrepancies between programme and performance to the detriment of our dollar resources;    for example, the programme of food imports from the U.S.A, for the first year of war on an f.o.b.basis was estimated at  9,165,000,      On the other hand,  the actualimports of food from the Uo S. A. , as recorded in the trade returnsfor thenjfirst four months of war total  7,621,000 on a c.i.f.basis, while the sums actually provided in U.S.  dollars by theExchange Control for the purchase of food during the first four months of war total  8,375,000.,      The difference between these twofor the first four months of the war is readily capablebut it is striking that they would appear toat an annual rate of  22 millions to  25 millionsan estimated programme of  9 millions of  2 millions to  3 millions, the for by the difference between f. o.b. andis disquieting that this difference doesfiguresof explanation,indicate importsc.i.f., as compared with.o.b. To the extentdiscrepancy is accountedc.i.f. prices (&quot;chough itnet appear to operate toreduce the demand for dollars) but, for

the rest, the figures would appear to suggest that we are importingmany foodstuffs that are unnecessary - and certainly manythat we cannot afford.4. The January figures of actual events tell an even morestartling tale than those for the first four months of war.    Thevalue of food imports from the U.S.A.  v/as  5.2 millions    c*i.f.  -say  2.8 millions f.o.h.   or at the rate of some  35 millions ayear.     The sum provided in U.S..-.  dollars for the purchase offood during the month was  5.9 millions.5. Imports of canned salmon were 2.3.  thousand tons - a quantity greater by 80% than the average monthly rate of importenvisaged in the   December programme and more than six times as great as that envisaged in February.    Imports of canned fruitwere over 11,000 tons - a quantity more than four times as great as the average monthly rate envisaged in   December or In February.Nor was this at the expense of dried fruit, of which the importwas at more than twice the rate of the   December estimate.    wheat and barley continued to arrive on a scale which has caused theactual for five months to exceed even our revised estimate fortwelve.     Apples and pears, expected to cease altogether, came in to the tune of  200,000.6. It would seem to be the case that large quantities of foodhave been coming into the country on private account, free from control - whether in the form of import licensing or of purchase by the Ministry of Food.     From the shipping and exhcange pointof view alike, it is essential that immediate action should betaken to exclude non-essential imports.rt. In these circumstances, I am emphatically of opinion thatany review of our import programme must take account not only ofthe total amount of our purchases, but also of the sources fromwhioh we purchase and of the nature of the purchases.      I must,therefore, ask that the Treasury should be closely associatedwith any such review that may be undertaken by the purchasingDepartments.      That such a review is necessary, I have no doubt.(Intld)    J.S.Treasury Chambers,S.W.I.,26th February, 1940.Richmond Terrace.  S.W.1.26th &apos; February s ISkO.
