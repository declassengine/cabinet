Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 85.WAR CABINET.NAVAL PRIZE MONEY AND PRIZE BOUNTY.I CIRCULATE for consideration by my colleagues a proposal that theKing should be moved to grant by the usual Proclamations Prize Money andPrize Bounty to the officers and men of the Naval Forces in the same way as inthe Great War of 1914 to 1918.The granfof Prize Money has been the unique and traditional enjoyment of the Royal Navy since the days of King John; but precedent is also massiveand modern. Under the decisions of the late War, when the whole issue wasrepeatedly thrashed out in the War Cabinet, the Navy received upwards of 14,000,000 in Prize, as well as  13,000,000 in War Gratuity. The WarGratuity is paid on a wider basis of service than Prize Money, which is strictlyrelated to actual &quot;sea-going &quot; time. Owing to the reluctance of the enemy to expose their merchant ships, and to their obnoxious practice of scuttling ratherthan submitting to capture, the proceeds of Prize will not be nearly so great inthis war as in the last. But the sailors regard Prize Money as their establishedright; they set far more by it than it is worth, and I am of opinion that theywould feel aggrieved if they were now to be deprived of it. The main burdenof the first six months&apos; fighting has fallen upon the Navy. They have had fromthe first moment to keep the seas open in the teeth of an even more incessant andruthless attack by surface raiders, submarines, mines and aircraft, than in thelast War. More than 3,000 Officers and men have already been killed, and the strain upon the others has been more intense than ever before. It would beimpolitic as well as ungrateful to select this occasion for inflicting what theywill regard as an injury, and as a novel inroad upon them, and I trust mycolleagues will not seek to make me the instrument of bringing them so surly a message from Whitehall.w. s. c.March 21, 1940.[21015]

SECRET.18NAVAL PRIZE  MONEY AND PRIZE  BOUNTY.THE grant of Prize Money, &amp;c., to the Fleet is said to be traceable as farback as the reign of King John. Certain it is that the Sovereign has made grants of Prize Money and Prize Bounty to the Navy in every war at sea for the last three centuries, including the war of 1914-18.Prize Bounty is the grant of  5 per head of the ship&apos;s company ofan enemy ship of war taken or destroyed. The grant is distributed to the crew of the captor ship or ships; and the facts must be proved in the Prize Court bythe captors, much in the same way that an ordinary maritime salvage claim isproved before the Admiralty Court. The procedure was permanently established in the Naval Prize Act, 1864, which says that if in any war the King grants PrizeBounty to the crews of His Majesty&apos;s Ships the amount shall be paid from public funds by the Treasury. (The amount thus paid in the last war was  177,000.)In view of the permanence of the 1864 Act no further steps beyond the grantby His Majesty would be necessary for an award of Prize Bounty in this war.Prize Money is not public money; it is the proceeds of captured enemy merchant ships or contraband cargoes, taken by the Navy at sea. Technicallythese are Droits of the Crown as opposed to Droits of Admiralty. The latter are the proceeds of enemy merchant ships seized in British ports. They wereformerly assigned to the Lord High Admiral, but they have long been surrendered to the Exchequer and no question concerning them now arises.To revert then to Droits of the Crown, the fruits of active operations by theNavy at sea, which are the basis of Prize Money in wars prior to that of 1914the grant was made in respect of each individual capture to the actual captorships alone. In the 1914 war the system was altered, and the proceeds of allcaptures were pooled in a Prize Fund, which was ultimately distributed to theseagoing Fleet. The qualification for full participation was 30 months seagoingservice, a proportionate rate being paid for lesser periods of seagoing service.This change to a pooling system was effected by the Naval Prize Act, 1918,which also set up a Judicial Tribunal to decide which monies properly accrued(as droits of the Crown) to the Prize Fund and what claims were proper to rankagainst the Prize Fund. Legislation similar to the Act of 1918 will presumablyhe necessary in this war, but it might be further explored whether legislation could be avoided.The position to-day is the same as arose in the Great War, 1914-1918. Thematter was then fully discussed by the War Cabinet with reference to the award of War Gratuity to the Services, and it was finally decided to continue thesehistoric grants of Prize Bounty and Prize Money to the Naval Forces.Two points remain : Co-operation between the Royal Navy and the RoyalAir Force in this war has been closer and more frequent than previously. Itmay be for consideration whether the King should be moved to grant Prize Moneyto the Naval Forces and to the Air Forces. It is to be noted that by a recent act the Air Force seem to&apos; have taken powers to take prize of enemy aircraft andvessels, though they appear to forgo any right to Prize Bounty. It is for theSecretary of State to indicate his wishes in this matter. If the decision isnegative, the Prize Tribunal would presumably, in accordance with their practice in joint captures by Army and. Navy in the last war, only award to the NavalPrize Fund a proportion of the proceeds of a Prize captured jointly by King&apos;s ships and aircraft (the aircrafts share going to the Exchequer).The last point is the participation in Prize Bounty and Prize Money by theDominion Navies. The Dominion Governments ought to be consulted before a radical change is made, as their navies presumably have the same expectation of grants as the Royal Navy has, seeing that they shared in the 1914 war. Theywould normally share in Prize Money from the Prize Fund just as personnel ofthe Royal Navy, but it may be that their share of Prize Bounty should be paidby the Dominion Exchequer.[21015]
