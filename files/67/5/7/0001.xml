PJi Jl7IPjINGaMe no r ahflura by:the Ju lii atfgr. of Transport.At the meeting of the i.-&apos;ar Cabinet on 6th December,  1939(War Cabinet 1C5 (39) Minute 2) reference v/as made to the general questions arising from a large scale diversion of shipping fromthe Esst to the Vest Coast, and it was agreed inter alia that consideration should be given to obtaining a number of smallDutch coastal motor vessels to help in meeting the need for small craft for coastwise shipping,DISCHARGE INTO BARGES.2.      The Committee referred to in paragraph 4 of W.?.   (G)(39) 122, and composed of representatives of the Admiralty,Ministry of Shipping end Ministry of Transport, has continued itsinvestigations into the possibilities of overside discharge atsheltered anchorages on the l/est Coast.     After exhaustiveexamination on the spot that Committee is satisfied that if theprincipal western ports are working to capacity - as in time of diversion would be the case - the maximum number of large vessels which could be discharged into barges with any prospect of getting the goods distributed is ten.      The Minister of Shipping hasarranged for sixty-nine barges to be transferred to the WestCoast as soon as possible, and for thirty more to be movedimmediately diversion is decided upon.     The Committee is satisfisdthat to provide facilities for handling further barges wouldinvolve quite disproportionate cost and that the facilities couldnot be provided within any reasonable time.3. To discharge ten large ships to barge is a relativelytrifling contribution to the solution of the problems raised bydiversion,  and the Committee has expressed the opinion, with

which I agree, that they must he tackled along two main lines,(i) additional coasters;    and (ii) increasing the resiliency ofthe ports.ADDITIONAL, COASvibRS.4.      A very rough calculation has shown that if the hastCoast were closed to large vessels at least 300 coasters could hevery usefully employed in off-loading the large vessels atsheltered anchorages on the West Coast and distributing the goodscoastwise.      The total fleet of British coasters is about 1,000vessels;    most of these would be already fully occupied inessential services and few would be available to assist in theimmediate problems of diversion.      Losses of these craft from enemy action have been at the rate of approximately 150 per annum,and the rate of neutral losses for similar tonnage is about thesame.      There is, therefore, the prospect of a very serious lossof coaster tonnage - particularly in time of diversion.5.      The Minister of Shipping is making every effort tocharter and purchase sufficient coasters, but there is no hope ofobtaining anything like the full number that would be required-It has so far only been possible to buy four, and charter twoDutch coasters direct, while fourteen have been chartered by commercial interests.      The prospects of obtaining further Dutchvessels are not promising.      I hope therefore that the highestdegree of priority may be given to the acquisition from everyavailable source of additional coaster tonnage, whether by charter,purchase or construction;    as a first step, I suggest that,including the Dutch vessels chartered under the authority already given,  100 coasters should be aimed at.      At the same time I trust that the question of construction will not be overlooked whilefurther efforts are made to purchase or charter additionalcoasters.

6.      It is understood that the Admiralty have had underconsideration the possibility of a large proportion of the butchcoaster fleet coming to this country in the event of hostilities in Holland.      In these circumstances, there may be room for mutual understanding by which we might be able to charter furtherDutch coasters, and it is possible that an approach through the diplomatic channel might be helpful.RESILIENCY OF what COAbT PORTS.7.      I am satisfied that there is a certain resiliency ofwhich, In case of need, use can and must be made, but I cannotpretend that if the East Coast is closed to large vessels forlong periods, the results will be other than very serious or thatlong delays will not occur in the discharge of certain cargoesand consequently to ships,  (c.f.  C.I.D. Paper No.  316 - A and pr.T.S.99 attached to W.P.   (G)   (39)  122).8.      The aim should clearly be to work throughout the twenty-four hours those ports which remain open and to secure a large and steady flow of goods from the ports to the principal consumingcentres.      This implies two distinct but closely related factors;first, the provision of physical means of distribution (e.g.,additional labour,  transport, and storage facilities, etc.);and secondly, a commercial mechanism to ensure that the fullest use is made of what physical means of distribution are available.9.      A large scale diversion from the East Coastnecessarily involves a re-orientation of both the physical meansof distribution and of the commercial mechanism;    to securesmooth functioning and the full use of the resiliency in theWestern ports it seems clear that at the earliest moment after

a large scale diversion is imminent warning should be given tothe ports themselves and to all Government &quot;Departments affected totake all possible measures for coping with it.      I think thatthe decision to introduce a policy of major diversion,  with all its consequences for the food and supply positions,  should issuefrom the War Cabinet.10.      The Port and Transit Organisation - on which are represented all the Departments interested in ships and. their cargoes - had in peace-time worked out a series of plans fordealing v/ith the war emergency and especially with diversion.Those plans have worked reasonably satisfactorily in thecircumstances prevailing up to date.     The experience of the last five months has shown, however,  that if the western ports wereto be put under the strain involved in complete diversion from east to west,   certain modifications,  and particularly a tighteningup of the present arrangements, axe necessary if the greatest possible use of the remaining ports is to be made.11.      The precise nature of the plans and arrangements to beprepared for immediate execution must necessarily differ in viewof the number of variable factors,  and much must depend on thecompetence and discretion of the local officers of the several departments in meeting unforeseen situations.      The following,however,  is a summary of the principal matters upon which further action is necessary:-A.    Physical means of distribution.(i)    The Ports - the existing arrangements to utiliseplant and capacity to the full, require little modification.Officers of the Admiralty, Ministry of Transport and Ministryof Shipx^ing have made personal visits to a number of theprincipal Port Emergency Committees, and the visits willcontinue, so that the arrangements are fully understood by the persons concerned locally.

(ii) Transport inland and coastwise - the existing plans are designed for the rapid allocation of transport facilities to the localities where the demand is heaviest.I am reviewing the arrangements for transport by rail, road and canal and propose to review with the Minister ofShipping the arrangements for coastwise transport.(iii) Lab our - an agreed scheme for the transfer ofdock labour has been drawn up.      I propose to discuss withthe Minister of Labour and National Service the arrangementsfor the rapid transfer of labour and for billeting, etc.(iv) Lighting - It is important that, in time of diversion work at the docks should not be impeded by the lack of adequate lighting.      I am discussing with theMinister of Home Security the arrangements required for adequate lighting in the Western ports.(v) Naval assistance - the Admiralty are consideringthe assistance which could be given to merchant vessels should any not be able to discharge at a quay,  e.g. theallotment of anchorages appropriated for naval purposes,the use of craft such as water barges, etc.B.    Commercial mechanism.(vi).    It is on the consignee, whether a GovernmentDepartment or private trader,  that the primary responsibilityrests to secure rapid passage of his goods through the ports.      As regards the private trader, Port emergency committees have considerable powers, by means of penaltyrents, compulsory removal to store, and designation of means of transport,  to spur him to action.     Delay, however,may be caused if the consignee cannot be identified,  or ifthe papers, import licences,  etc. are absent (in time of diversion this is not unlikely);    I therefore propose toexamine whether in such circumstances the goods should not

be requisitioned on the quay, passed through the port bythe requisitioning authority, and disposed, of by sale.(vii).    As regards goods on Government account, I trust that the Minister of Pood and the Minister of supply will ensure that their local officers are instructed to takeespecial steps in time of diversion to clear the goods inwhich they are concerned from the port.     At present penaltyrents are not leviable on goods which are government property,  and I am discussing with the Treasury thepossibility of extending them to such property;    experience in the last war was that Government Departments were the worst offenders, and that when penalty rents were applied,the effect was most salutary on those concerned.(viii).    Customs - provision has already been made forcertain relaxations of normal Customs procedure and for thetransfer of staff as required.      I trust the localCollectors will be instructed to give every facility forthe rapid clearance of goods.12.    I have set out in brief outline the principal fieldson which I suggest that interlocking and pre-concerted plans should be prepared, to come into operation when a decision is taken that a major diversion is imminent.      In many of the fields the plans are already in an advanced state (if not completed) as aresult of discussions on the Standing Committee of the Port and transit Organisation.      There are, however,  at least eightDepartments which are actively concerned in the preparation and execution of the plans in one or more of the fields,  and severalothers which are less directly concerned;    as the Ministerprimarily responsible for the Port and Transit Organisation Ihave felt bound, having regard to the gravity of the problem,  tobring the matter to the notice of the War Cabinet with a view tothe rapid crystallisation of those plans and arrangements.

&apos;    &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; .   - 7 -13.      I therefore ask the War Cabinet(a) to invite the Secretary of Otate for Foreign affairs to consider in conjunction with the Minister of economic warfare and. the Minister oi Shipping,  the most appropriate method of persuading the Dutch Government to facilitate the chartering of a large tonnage of coasters.(b) to invite the First Lord of the Admiralty and theMinister of Shipping to consider the practicability of constructing additional coaster tonnage.(As a first step the number of coasters to be obtainedunder (a) and  (b) should be 100).(c) to determine that a policy of large scale diversion of shipping shall be introduced only on the directionof the War Cabinet,  and. that as long notice as possibleshall be given to the Minister of Transport and to theDepartments concerned.(d) with a view to the submission to the War cabinet of a Report before the end of March,  to invite theMinisters concerned to take immediate steps to complete the necessary plans and arrangements for dealing withthe problems of diversion should the need arise(especially as to transport inland and coastwise;    thetransfer of labour;    the provision of adequate lighting;naval assistance;    the requisitioning of unclaimedgoods;    instructions to the local officers of the Supplyand Food Departments and of the Commissioners of customs and Excise;    and the extension of penalty rentsto Government property),(Intd.)     E.W.Ministry of Transport.22nd February,  1940.
