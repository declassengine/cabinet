PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT).DtSECRET.W.P.(G)(40)  80. COPY NO. ( \15TH MARCH,  1940.:   .      WAR CABINET.TRANSATLANTIC AIRMAIL SERVICE.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of information and the Postmaster General01. While we do not,  in view of the urgency of Servicereasons, raise any objection at this juncture against theSecretary of State for Air&apos;s proposal to withdraw for service uses the aircraft which would otherwise have &quot;been available for a resumption this Summer of a British north atlantic Air Service, nor to make any definite representat3onsswe would like to submit our point of view and our concern.2P ?/e believe that it is of particular value in thepresent state of affairs to develop to the utmost all links between Great Britain and North America, of which the Trans-atlantic Air Service is an important one.    The partnership between the U.S.A., the U.K., Canada and Eire, which hasbeen responsible for the North Atlantic Air Service, was notmerely of great intrinsic value, but was significant as asymbol of the friendly collaboration obtaining betweenkindred democracies.3, Considerable prestige for Britain can be obtainedfrom an effective share in the Transatlantic Air Serviceand we feel that great propaganda advantage could have beenobtained thereby,    Moreover the display of British News andPictures in the North American Press, as compared with thatof German ones, depends largely on relative speed of trans-mission, so that this country would be losing an importantpublicity advantage if a speedy British Air Mail Service direct from the British Isles to North America were long absent.

regularity and safety as well as speed which wouldcharacterise a British Air Mail Service across the atlantic and with the postal significance of these.    Thegood will of American Commercial and Press Representatives,which it is its constant interest to cultivate, is asmuch dependent on optimum postal facilities as on anyother single factor.5. The Clipper Service working from Lisbon isscheduled to leave on Sunday and Wednesday mornings.Owing to the refusal of permission to fly over Spain the sunday connection leaves London on Friday afternoon by air to Paris,  thence by surface to Lisbon.      TheWednesday service leaves London on Monday and goes by air Prance via Marseilles and North Africa.      The service is most irregular.      The average time from London to new York is 10 days and Mails have taken 29 days.      Partof our Mail has several times not been taken aboard, butleft to accumulate at Lisbon.6. The North Atlantic Service of last Summer,  thoughonly operating for two months,  carried on the average750 lbs. mails, representing about 20,000 postal packets,and was being increasingly utilised.7. The United States Air Mail is considered to be of greater importance in War than in Peace time since itshould provide a for height hour service as compared with7-9 days by sea and is used in the duplication ofimportant documents.      Moreover, War conditions make the surface Mails intermittent and unreliable.

8. We think it right that our point of view shouldbe available and on record at the time the Cabinetconsiders the Secretary of State&apos;s proposal.We greatly regret that the British Air Serviceacross the Atlantic will not continue this year.We strongly hope that this service will be resumed whenever practicable.(Initialled)    J.C.W.R.G.C.T.Richmond Terrace, S,W.l.
