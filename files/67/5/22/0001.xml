Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1940.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 72.WAR CABINET.SOV1ET-G ERMAN  TRADE.Memorandum by the Minister for Economic Warfare.I HAVE had prepared in the Ministry of Economic Warfare for theinformation of the Cabinet the attached paper on Soviet-German trade.The chief conclusions I draw from it are : (a) The U.S.S.R. can give economic help to Germany in two ways : by pro-viding raw materials and food-stuffs of domestic origin and byfacilitating transit trade between Germany and other neutral countries across Soviet territory.(b) The Trade Agreements concluded between Germany and the U.S.S.R.have little more than political and propaganda value. The nature andvolume of goods delivered will be governed by Soviet willingness and ability to place the goods required at Germany&apos;s disposal.(c) Although Russian supplies to Germany since the outbreak of war havebeen of little significance, efforts now being made, especially by theGermans, to improve transportation facilities may succeed during1941 in largely counteracting the Allied economic pressure in other directions, provided that the U.S.S.R. is not herself engaged in a major war and the present rate of consumption in Germany is not increased.(d) It is not possible to limit Soviet sales of domestic produce to germany by means of a War Trade Treaty, pre-emptive action, or other meansopen directly to the Ministry of Economic Warfare.(e) Of the four routes whereby transit trade across the U.S.S.R. reachesGermany two are at present of minor importance, namely, the land(and air) route from Central China and the railway route fromAfghanistan.(/) Supplies of some value are reaching Germany from Iran and Turkey via the Black Sea. Interception of these would only seem possible were itfeasible to exercise contraband control in that Sea. Such a measure would also reduce the supplies of Soviet domestic produce to Germany,especially of manganese and petroleum, which are known to be coming forward by this route. Unfortunately, under the provisions of theMont reux Straits Conventions, passage into the Black Sea is forbidden to all belligerent warships if Turkey is neutral. This seems to rule out any possibility of our exercising contraband control in the Black Sea,except with Tui&apos;key&apos;s connivance, which is unlikely to be forthcomingso long as she intends to maintain her neutrality.(g) Germany, with Russian consent, is making great efforts to import fromthe American Continent and Asia, via Vladivostock or Dairen and the trans-Siberian Railway, deficiency commodities of relatively high price and great value to her in the prosecution of the war. There is evidence of rubber reaching Germany by this route and a prima faciepresumption that copper, tin, ferro-alloys and other materials of high[20975] B
importance are being delivered or are about to be delivered to germany by the same means. Even a certain amount of so bulky a commodityas soya beans has been forwarded by this route.(A) The transport capacity placed at Germany&apos;s disposal, which may beincreased as soon as rolling-stock now under construction in Germanybecomes available, can probably handle a sufficient weight of thespecial commodities envisaged to suffice to meet German essential needs.(/) An attempt to stop German transit trade over the Trans-Siberian Kail-way implies an attempt to restrict the trade of the two ports of Vladivostock and Dairen. This cannot be done by naval actionalone, and it is essential, if any effective control is to be established,to have some collaboration from Japan and the United States ofAmerica. Collaboration with the Government of the Netherlands east indies would also he desirable, but seems most unlikely to he obtainable.I would draw special attention to the French Governments request that weshould decide, in view of the recent Russo-German Economic Agreement, to seizeabnormal consignments of important goods going to Russia, regardless of the factthat damages may lie awarded against us. To seize Russian cargoes merely on theground that they were Russian cargoes would, of course, be to treat Russia as anenemy, and could not lie justified on the mere fact that there is an agreementwhereby Russia supplies Germany with certain raw materials. If my colleagueswish. I could have a special paper prepared on this subject, but I would suggestthat the reply to be returned to the French Government ought to follow the linessutrsested in 5 below.The action which I would propose is:  1. The establishment of further drastic restrictions on trade from allied countries to Russia, and an approach to the Governments of the Dominions. Indiaand Burma to this end.2. An arrangement with the Japanese Government to limit supplies sentto Russia or Germany via the Trans-Siberian Railway as a condition of our readiness to supply Japan with her normal requirements of Empire raw materials.(We might also use as a counter-weight any concession which it may anywaybe necessary to grant to Japan in respect of our control of enemy exports, thoughany special concession to Japan in this field has the obvious disadvantage of discrimination in favour of one neutral country with all that this may entail.)3. An understanding with the United States Government to limit suppliesof key commodities from America to Russia, and to support us in obtainingJapans collaboration as proposed above.4. An understanding with the Chinese Government about their exports toRussia under the Sino-Soviet barter agreement.5. A communication to the French Government in reply to the notes whichthey have recently addressed to us,(a) informing them briefly of our considered views; of the restrictions placedon the export to the Soviet Union of certain commodities from british colonial territories and through British ports; expressing readiness to consider extending these restrictions to all articles of contraband;informing the French Government of the approach which we aremaking to the Dominions. India and Burma; and inviting the French,if they have not already done so, to enforce similar restrictive measuresthroughout the French Empire.(b) inviting them to agree that, in order to supplement this Empire-widecontrol, it is essential to come to some arrangement with the UnitedStates of America, Japan and possibly the Netherlands East Indies,though there would appear to be no reason why Soviet vessels (andpossibly also Dutch vessels from the Netherlands East Indies) thought to be carrying cargo of suspect destination should not from now onbe taken into Indo-Chinese ports if their interception is possible;
(c) informing them, that with a view to expediting some arrangement withthe United States Government, Mr. Gwatkin is being supplied with information for communication to Mr. Morgenthau showing how important the traffic over the Siberian railway is actually andpotentially; it is hoped that in this way Mr. Morgenthau may be ledto recognise how vital parallel action by the United States of america is and how necessary some measure of Japanese co-operation if the siberian leak is to be stopped up. The French Government might beinvited to supply M. Rist with any additional information they mayhave and furnish him with appropriate instructions;(d) asking them to bear all this in mind in their forthcoming talks withthe Japanese Ambassador in Paris, and to endeavour to elicit from himanything throwing light on the sort of price that the Japanese would expect for their co-operation.I should add that I have shown this paper to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs who concurs generally in my proposals.R. II. C.March 1 1, 1940.Note on Soviet-German Trade by the Ministry of Economic Warfare.Part 1. An Estimate of the present Position.Trade relations between the U.S.S.R. and Germany so far differ little fromthose obtaining in the present war between Germany and other adjacent neutral countries. Russia is reach&apos; to export to Germany surplus domestic products andto extend facilities for the passage across Soviet territory of Crerman trade withother countries. But. in all relevant transactions between Germany and theU.S.S.R. which have come to notice, the latter has so far required full economiccounter-value for her goods and services. There has been no sign of anyreadiness on part of the Soviets to extend economic aid to Germany in exchange for political concessions or to strain Russian economy for Germany&apos;s benefit. Thechief difference in the position of the U.S.S.R. and of other adjacent neutral countries lies, on the one hand, in the actual or potential size of Soviet domesticresources, and on the other, in the grave practical difficulties confronting theAllies in the exercise of their belligerent rights over certain approaches to Sovietterritory.The U.S.S.R. as a Source of Supply to Germany.&apos;2. The text of the trade agreement between Germany and the U.S.S.R,initialled in Moscow by Herr von Ribbentrop in August 1939 has not been published. Subsequent events, however, show that this agreement was in verybroad terms. It did not lay down the quantities of goods to be exchanged between the two countries, the dates of delivery or terms of payment. It canindeed be written off as little more than a political gesture expressing the willingness of both sides to expand trade in certain goods to their mutual advantage. From what has later become known regarding the actual exchangeof goods between Germany and the U.S.S.R., the chief practical effect of the august document, apart from its value as an instrument of propaganda, which now extends to packing German goods in Russian wrappers made and printedin Germany, may in fact have been to make it clear that Russia only envisagesextending- economic aid to Germany in exchange for value received.3. Immediately after the August agreement a large number of Germanofficials, business men and technicians were despatched to the U.S.S.R. to continuenegotiations for some more precise blanket arrangement, the outcome of whichis the signature of a further agreement on the 11th February, and to try,meanwhile, to purchase Soviet raw materials in exchange&apos; for Germanmanufactures.[20975]
4. A good deal of reliable information is available regarding actualtransactions which have taken place between Germany and Russia to date. Allreflect their purely commercial character. In the first place there have been nobarter deals but sales evaluated in money fully paid over either in cash or bybank drafts. In the second place the prices of Soviet goods have been fullycompetitive and nearly always above world prices. It seems probable, therefore,that the Agreement of the 11th February, the text of which is still secret, doeslittle more than establish special clearing arrangements between the twocountries. To this extent the second Agreement should prove of some advantage to Germany, since hitherto a proportion of the Soviet raw materials and footl-stulYs actually purchased has apparently been paid for in dollars. There seemsno reason to suppose, however, that the Agreement of the 11th February will have any profound effect on the quantity of goods which the U.S.S.R. will in practicedeliver to Germany in coming months. This is. and probably will remain,limited by the extent of Russia&apos;s exportable surplus of the commodities which germany desires, the readiness of the U.S.S.R. to increase that surplus artificiallyat the expense of her own economy, the rapidity with which Germany can deliverto Russia the machine tools, plant and equipment, which the U.S.S.R. demands in exchange for her raw materials, and, finally, the capacity of the Soviet andGerman transportation systems to carry the weight of goods involved.5. If the U.S.S.R. remains unwilling to risk damage to her own economy and is prepared to export to Germany only her normal exportable surplus ofthose raw materials and food-stuffs which Germany requires, the economic help which she can extend to Germany is likely to be very small for a considerable time. Even so. in the case of certain key materials such as petroleum, manganese,asbestos and phosphates, Russian supplies, if they can be transported to Germany,will be of great value. For example, it may well prove that the timely receipt byGermany of, say, a quarter of a million tons of petroleum products of the rightkind, may just stave off a serious crisis for long enough to allow German syntheticproduction to increase sufficiently to fill the gap. or may tide over a temporaryshortage of supply from elsewhere.6. On the other hand, were the U.S.S.R. prepared to risk some damage toher own economy for political reasons, such as a desire to prolong hostilities,the aid which she could give to Germany would be materially greater. Althoughshe could not supply her from her own resources such German deficiencycommodities as rubber, copper, tin. nickel and a number of the rarer ferro alloys,she could, in addition to making good the whole German deficiency in manganese,asbestos and phosphates, materially increase supplies of petroleum, cotton, iron ore. oilseeds and oilcake. Even so, it appears likely that she would have to risksevere damage to her own economy before supplying Germany with sufficient ofthese and other materials to do more than prolong the agony, unless the handling of the transactions, including the supervision of production and the conductof transportation in the U.S.S.R. were to a large measure carried out under german supervision.7. It is in this possibility that danger lies. At present mere statisticalconsiderations seem to show that the capacity of the transportation system of theU.S.S.R. suffices to carry to Germany all that Russia could export from her truesurplus and even a very large proportion of what Russia might withdraw fromconsumption if willing to risk a domestic shortage. This theoretic capacity is.however, immensely reduced in practice by Soviet inefficiency. There is little doubt that under direct German supervision, if Germany can spare enoughtechnicians and skilled labour for the purpose, and if the U.S.S.R. would allow them to operate effectively, a considerable improvement could be effected.8. In short, the position with regard to the supply of indigenous rawmaterials and food-stuffs to Germany from Russia is that up to date, no matter what Agreements may have been signed, or what capital may have been made out of them for propaganda purposes, actual deliveries from Russia are wellbelow what Germany hoped to receive, and far below what is necessary so to counteract Allied pressure at present exercised in other fields as to render itineffective. The signature of a new Agreement, whatever its terms may be.will do little to improve the position in the near future, since the difficulties facing-extensive Soviet-German trade lie in the practical rather than the political sphere.
On the other hand, whether under this or some other Agreement, should the soviet authorities, for political reasons, really endeavour to help Germany out of herincreasing embarrassment by seriously reducing domestic consumption, and. above-all, by permitting German technicians to take charge of production and transportation, supplies to Germany from the U.S.S.R. will increase. Indeed,under optimum conditions, it is not impossible for the rate of supply to increasematerially towards the end of 1940 and by 1941 or 1942 to have reached a level which would go far to neutralise the effect of the Allied blockade elsewhereprovided that there were, meanwhile, no great increase in the present Germanrate of consumption. In this sector of the economic front, if it be regarded in isolation, time is not on the side of the Allies.9. For the moment, Soviet economic aid to Germany is further hindered bythe Russo-Finnish war. It is possible that the attack was timed to coincide witha season when commerce in the Gulf of Finland would anyhow be reduced bywinter conditions. The continuance of operations in and around the Gulf throughthe Spring may be expected to react unfavourably upon the quantity of Russiangoods reaching Germany by the convenient additional sea-route from Leningrad.Moreover, although the additional expenditure of raw materials occasioneddirectly and indirectly by this campaign is almost negligible in relation to Sovietproduction as a whole, the war is submitting the crazily balanced transportationsystem of Russia to a strain quite disproportionate to the haulage problems involved, through the necessity of carrying goods and men in a direction cuttingtransversely across the normal flow, and thus reducing the transport capacityavailable to carry goods to Germany. These aids to the Allies&apos; economic campaign against Germany will disappear with the ending of Finnish resistance.German Transit Trade across the U.S.S.R.10. The second way in which the U.S.S.R. is helping to supply germany is by carrying German trade with other countries across Soviet territory. this service is fully charged for, though the German-Soviet Agreement of the11th February probably provides for the inclusion of these charges in any clearingarrangements which may have been included therein.11. Two major and two minor trade routes are thus open to Germany,so long as Russia is willing and able to place transport facilities at her disposal.The two minor trade routes are unlikely to assume great importance. The first is the overland or air route between Russia and Central China. By this routethe U.S.S.R. has in the past supplied armaments and aircraft to the Chinesearmies. There has recently been talk of the transport of tin and tungsten inthe contrary direction. The Yunnan output of tin smelted locally is reportednow to average 1,000 tons a month, and fears have been expressed that this might reach the U.S.S.R. by lorry and be forwarded on to Germany. Again, in had discussions with the French, T. V. Soong has threatened to send tungsten by airfrom Chungking to Russia. A little consideration of the difficulties involved in either procedure in relation to the weights which must be carried to be effectiveallows us to contemplate both propositions without grave concern.12. The other minor route in which Germany is betraying interest is thatvia the Trans-Caspian Railway to Afghanistan, and is really a prolongation of the route already being used for communication between Germany and Iran.The Afghan Governments appeals to us to allow the German goods which theyhave bought to be shipped and forwarded through India suggest that at least,the Afghans place little faith in the alternative route. Nevertheless, Afghanistanhas sold 4,000 tons of wool to Russia at 40 per cent, above the price bid by theUnited Kingdom, and the Afghan Government have so far refused our offerat the ruling world price for 10,000 to 18,000 tons of cotton, on the plea of ahigher offer&quot; from elsewhere. It is doubtful if the U.S.S.R. is the ultimatepurchaser either of the wool or of the cotton. Moreover, the Germans are sending a mission to Kabul to organise German-Afghan trade. For the time being, bow-ever, such plans can hardly achieve results of such magnitude as to counteractour economic pressure on Germany elsewhere.13. Of the two major trade routes across Russia which Germany isdelevoping. the first involves the Black and Caspian Seas and the Soviet railway
system in the extreme south. The second depends upon the Trans-siberian railway.14. Since last autumn some of the produce of Turkey and Iran has foundits way to Germany, and German goods have been delivered in exchange, by thesouthern route. The German exports concerned cover a wide variety of goods,including machinery, textiles and chemicals. The German imports concerned are chiefly of animal or vegetable origin, but include supplies of an importantnature such as hides and skins, cotton, wool, and fat producing substances. Twoexperimental imports by this route of molybdenum and nickel ore have alsocome to notice. Moreover, Russian shipments from Batum across the Black Seaare the only means by which the U.S.S.R. could supply petroleum to Germany,apart from what might he derived from a strictly limited output of the Galicianoilfields. Hitherto Caucasian oil for Germany has been carried to Odessa and thence via Lemberg. Recently, however, the Germans have acquired some storage facilities at Constanza and have chartered Italian tankers to act as depot ships at Varna in Bulgaria. While the transport facilities westwards from Constanzawill probably be congested with Roumanian petroleum, the transport of oil from bulgaria to Germany can proceed by a separate route through Yugoslavia.15. Germany is building and buying large numbers of oil tank cars, someof them fitted to run both on the Russian and standard gauge. As this newrolling stock is delivered, so will German supplies of petroleum from roumania and from Russia tend to increase. Existing railway tracks suffice to accommodateseveral times the number of trains per day that are at present using them.16. As early  as November 1939 negotiations were on foot for the carriage of German trade by the Trans-Siberian Railway. It may be objected that the capacity of this railway is limited, and that the cost of freighting goods acrossthis immense stretch of over 6,600 miles of railway must be prohibitive. both these objections are only relatively valid. The transport of goods betweenVladivostock and Konigsberg may take a long time, but once they start upon their journey there is no -prima facie reason why they should not ultimately arriveat their destination. Free use of the port of Leningrad should speed up this trade.17. The capacity of the railway is certainly not unlimited, but it is reported on very reliable authority that, after due investigation by German as well asRussian experts, the Soviet authorities feel confident that they can place atGerman disposal a capacity of up to 1,000 tons per day in either direction. Thiswould not allow large bulk cargoes to pass along the route; in fact, there is some evidence that the Germans have abandoned the hope of using it to cany soya beansin large quantities. On the other hand, the route should be capable of exploitationfor the carriage in either direction, but particularly inwards to Germany, of commodities of high intrinsic value and of which Germany requires onlyrelatively small weights.18. There is evidence not only that Germany proposes to try and importthese commodities via Siberia, but that consignments of rubber, cotton, wood oil,egg yolk, tea, soya beans and soya bean oil are, in fact, known to have left forKonigsberg, while quotations f.o.b. Vladivostock have been made to Far Easternfilms for plant, machinery and chemicals manufactured in Germany. The french have information of large quantities of German drugs reaching Kobe via Siberiafor transhipment to South America. Japan is also known to pay for Germangoods on receipt of documents showing them to have left Konigsberg forVladivostock. In respect of imports such as those described whose price relative to their weight is high and whose value to Germany in her present circumstancesfar exceeds their price, the extra freight charge for the long overland haul is negligible and becomes wholly irrelevant in the case of even more valuablecommodities such as tin, molybdenum, tungsten, cobalt and other metals used forspecial steels, shortage of which is reported to be causing Germany very grave concern.19. The question naturally arises as to the extent to which the Trans-Siberian route is actually being used, and the degree of significance to be attachedto the imports which Germany is likely in practice to receive by this means.On this point reliable information available leaves no doubt as to German
optimism. Germany has undertaken to convert 9,000 waggons to the Russiangauge for service on the Trans-Siberian route, and there is no lack of evidence thatan extensive organisation of German agencies has now been formed in theFar Fast for the purpose of furthering this trade. The well-known Japanesefirms of Mitsui and Mitsubishi are also interested. In fact, the extent of Japaneseco-operation may be considerable. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tokyo statesthat exports of rubber and tin from Kobe to Dairen and Vladivostock in november last were at least 2.745 tons and 1.500 tons respectively. 720 tons of rubber, whicharrived in Kobe in December, have been bought by the German Consul for despatch to Germany via Siberia, while more recent information from Tokyo states thata further trans-shipment of over 2.000 tons of rubber is about to take place atKobe. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Batavia also informs us that theU.S.S.R. is enquiring for shipping space for up to 7,000 tons of rubber with aVladivostock/Kobe option for the end of February and early March.20. The difficulty of identifying individual Far Eastern shipments toGermany is almost insuperable, since all shipments to Russia are invariablyconsigned to one or another of the Soviet Government Trading Organisations.There is. however, evidence that German firms are interested in this traffic, apartfrom which the sudden rise of Soviet imports via Vladivostock is of itselfsuspicious. Between October 1939 and mid-January 1940 shipments of copper,brass, rubber, tin and molybdenum from the United States and the netherlands east Indies to Vladivostock or Dairen have equalled or exceeded the averagenormal rate of import of these commodities into the whole of the U.S.S.R. since their consumption in Manchukuo is insignificant, shipments to Dairen are certainly destined ultimately either for the U.S.S.R or for Germany.21. It must be admitted, however, that the U.S.S.R. appears recently tohave diverted the bulk of her overseas imports from Baltic and Black Sea ports to Vladivostock and Dairen. It is unlikely that machine tools consigned to theU.S.S.R. by this route are intended for Germany, and it may well be that aconsiderable proportion of the increased Far Eastern deliveries of raw materials are also on Soviet account.22. The position can be summed up as follows : Soviet imports of rubber,copper, brass, tin, molybdenum and other materials via Far Eastern ports are running at a rate above the normal for the whole of the U.S.S.R.   Bv wav ofm ft t    * -1 %/.example, 18 months&apos; normal imports ot molybdenum for the whole Soviet Unionhave been received in Far Eastern ports in the past three or four months. Butthere is at present no clear proof save in the case of rubber that any of these imports have been purchased for German account, though they are all well-knownGerman deficiencies, which Germany is making great efforts to obtain by other&apos; means.23. It may be that the U.S.S.R. is increasing its stocks in view of possible future contingencies, which would include a United States embargo on the exportof some of the commodities concerned. This is suggested by the fact that theSoviet authorities have recently taken to shipping rapidly purchases made in theUnited States to Manzanillo in Mexico, there to await cargo space available forVladivostock. Soviet ships sent in ballast from Vladivostock to fetch these goods are consigned to the German Consul at Manzanillo This obviously excitessuspicion, though it does not afford conclusive evidence of a German destination,since there is no Soviet authority to take delivery of the ships at the Mexicanport. Since the 5th February a considerable weight of copper. 300 tons ofmolybdenum and more machine tools have left the United States for Manzanillofailing direct shipment to Vladivostock, and a further 600 tons of tin is awaitingshipment from New York.Part 2. Measures which might be taken to reduce Soviet-German Trade and transit Trade.24. The relief so far afforded to Germany by Russia has not been great.Nevertheless, it is clear from what has been said above that this relief may grow-in volume and in value to Germany and gather momentum in the process.Provided that Russia is not herself involved in a major war, the economic helpshe can extend to Germany by the supply of domestic produce and the granting of
facilities for transit trade across Soviet territory may so have increased in ayear&apos;s time, or even less, as seriously to counteract the economic pressure exercised by the Allies in other directions/ It is necessary, therefore, to consider what action the Allies might take to prevent such a dangerous expansion of Soviet-German trade. The action which the Allies are in a position to take may bevery limited, but that is all the more reason for taking stock of the position, andfor&quot; devising if possible a comprehensive scheme based upon whatever settled policy may be thought likely, if agreed upon with the French Government, andconsistently carried out, to produce the best results.Sooicl Domestic Exports to Germany.25. In so far as concerns the supply to Germany of Soviet domestic produce,little action seems possible at present in the political or economic sphere. Therecan be no question at present of concluding a War Trade Agreement with theU.S.S.R. which would achieve the ends desired by the Allies. Nor is there anysign at present that a change in the Soviet Governments attitude is likely.It is suggested, therefore, that it might be sound policy, and could in any casedo little harm, to adopt a general policy of economic restriction towards SovietRussia. If at any time the Soviet Government, or their successors, should feeldisposed to change their unsatisfactory attitude towards Germany, perhaps fromfear of German domination, and come to terms with the Allies, any economicinconvenience which they may now suffer as a result of their economic assistanceto Germany will be a further inducement to them to put their relations with theAllies on a new and more satisfactory basis.Transit Trade across Russia from China. Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey.26. With the exception of the Trans-Siberian Railway, which will beconsidered below, the land and air routes from China across Russia are of little importance and are unlikely to carry large quantities of Chinese goods toGermany. The routes across the southern part of the Soviet Union to and fromIran and Afghanistan are somewhat more practicable. Traffic across the black sea is also being developed as a route for shipment of Russian supplies toGermany. It would appear very desirable to find means of stopping this traffic,and the French Mission have raised the question, especially in regard to oilshipments. But under the provisions of the Montreux Straits Convention(Article 19, paragraph 2) passage into the Black Sea is forbidden to all belligerentwarships if Turkey is neutral, except in cases not here material (League action and assistance to a victim of aggression under a Pact to which Turkey is a party).This seems to rule out any possibility of British or French warships exercisingcontraband control in the Black Sea. except with Turkey&apos;s connivance which is unlikely to be forthcoming so long as she intends to maintain her neutrality.Assuming that it is not possible in present circumstances to interfere with tliesea routes across the Black Sea. any action by the Allies would have to be takenin Iran or Afghanistan. It is doubtful whether much could be achieved by war trade Agreements with either of those countries, since neither would be willingto stop its trade with Russia and Germany merely in order to meet the wishes of the Allies. Fortunately, however, neither Iran nor Afghanistan is likely tosend to Germany much that is of value for war purposes. In the case of Afghanand Iranian cotton and wool, which are perhaps the most important goods likelyto be sent from those countries to Germany, it may be possible for the Allies tomake pre-emptive purchases, or at least, by putting forward pre-emptive offers,to ensure that Germany will have to pay high prices. Any Turkish goodsproceeding to Germany via Russia can be controlled only through negotiationswith the Turkish Government.The Trans-Siberian Railway.27. The main efforts of the Allies must be directed towards restricting thegoods proceeding to Germany by the Trans-Siberian Railway. If, as stated above,the Soviet authorities believe that they can place at German disposal a capacityof up to 1,000 tons per day in either direction on the Trans-Siberian Railway, thenGermany should be in a fair way to acquiring through this channel a substantial proportion of her deficiency commodities, non-ferrous metals, tin, rubber,vegetable oils, &amp;c.    How to stop this important gap in our control of German
trade is a very difficult problem. Since all idea of reaching an agreement with theSoviet Government on the subject must at present be ruled out, the question is how to control imports and exports passing through the two ports of Vladivostock andDairen. Owing to the difficulty of naval control in the Northern Pacific, it willbe necessary for our contraband measures to be supplemented by administrative action to restrict exports from British and French territories, and by politicalunderstandings with foreign Powers to restrict exports to Russia from their territories. The most important foreign countries trading with Vladivostockand Dairen are the United States of America, Japan, China. Thailand, thePhilippine Islands and the Dutch East Indies.Allied Exports to Russia.28. Before considering how to restrict trade between foreign countries andVladivostock, it may be well to set forth what can be clone to restrict trade betweenAllied territory and Russia. Steps have already been taken to stop the export toRussia of raw and semi-manufactured materials from the United Kingdom andfrom India and the Colonies, while the Dominions are understood also to beenforcing restrictions of some kind on their exports to Russia. Provided that theconcurrence of the Dominions can be obtained, it can easily be arranged that similar restrictions should be extended to all classes of contraband. It would notbe necessary formally to notify the Russian Government, or indeed to make any announcement on the subject, and the reply to any questions could, at least in somecases, be on the lines of the reply recently given to a similar enquiry from theJapanese Government, that the export of these goods cannot at present be sanctioned on account of the domestic needs and military necessities of the Allies.If the Governments of the Empire are prepared to agree to such a self-denyingrestriction on their own trade with Russia, it may be the less difficult to induce othercountries to accept restrictions on their trade with Vladivostock. There is every reason to suppose, as will be seen later, that the French Government are anxious that drastic restrictions should be imposed on trading with Russia, and will beprepared to go as far as His Majesty&apos;s Government in enforcing such restrictionsas may be decided upon.A Hied Naval Control in the Pacific.29. The Allies do not dispose at present of adequate naval forces in the Fat-East which could intercept on the High Seas all vessels carrying contraband to vladivostock and Dairen. Nor. owing to the general situation in the Far East, willit be possible for the Allied naval forces alone to operate an effective contraband control of shipping proceeding to those ports. It may be possible to stop russian and Dutch ships in the South China Seas carrying rubber and tin from theNetherlands East Indies and to control exports from Thailand and the Philip-pines, but it would certainly not be practicable, if only for political reasons, to try to stop Japanese ships in the waters adjacent to Japan. It would also be difficult for our naval controls, for political as well as for geographical reasons, to stop anddivert United States ships carrying cargoes from the United States to vladivostock. It is, in fact, essential, if we are effectively to restrict the trade ofVladivostock and Dairen, that our naval measures should be supplemented bysome kind of political understanding with Japan and the United States ofAmerica.Possibility of Securing an Understanding with Japan and the United States ofA. merica.30. It may appear at first sight unreasonably optimistic even to imagine thepossibility that Japan might be prepared to assist us in enforcing contraband control against Russia and Germany. Indeed, it is by no means certain that suchan arrangement can be reached or that any assurances obtained from the Japanesecould be relied upon. There is, however, just a faint hope that the JapaneseGovernment may be willing to come to some arrangement. The idea of stoppingraw materials useful for war purposes from reaching Russia would have someattraction for those many Japanese who still regard war with Russia as more orless inevitable. It would, of course, be necessary for the Japanese to receive a.quid pro quo.31. The obvious bargaining counter exists in Japan&apos;s great need of rawmaterials for which she is largely dependent on the British Empire and the[20975] c
United States. We might well make it a condition of the supply to Japan of hernormal domestic requirements* that she should cease to facilitate shipments to vladivostock or Dairen for Russia or Germany, e.g., that she should prohibit, or at least control, the carriage to Russia in Japanese ships or on Japanese-controlledrailways of certain commodities to be notified to her by the British authorities.32. There is no doubt that a very serious degree of pressure can be exercisedupon Japan through the withholding of essential supplies from the BritishEmpire. In fact, the refusal to permit the export to Dairen of a consignmentof jute bags from India and the control of wool exports from Australia havealready produced much perturbation in Japanese commercial and official circles.Moreover, the economic interests of the great Japanese firms and their increasingneed of credits make them very susceptible to pressure, and it may well be possibleeither to exercise such pressure on them to an increasing degree or to supplement the action proposed above by attempting to come to some kind of semi-officialunderstanding with the two leading Japanese Merchant Houses, Mitsui andMitsubishi, in whose hands lie the greater part of the Japanese trade with Russia,-33. Alternatively, it has been suggested that we should facilitate the passage through our controls of certain German exports urgently required by Japan for&quot; defence purposes.&quot; This suggestion has, however, the grave disadvantage ofentailing discrimination in Japan&apos;s favour in the operation of our control ofGerman exports a discrimination which will certainly lead to renewed protests from other neutral countries, including possibly the United States. It would not,therefore, be advisable to offer any concession to Japan in this field beyond whatis anyhow likely to be necessary. Moreover, it is, of course, only too probable thatif through Japanese collaboration the Trans-Siberian gap in our control is largelystopped, the Germans will decline to complete any more orders for Japan&apos;s defence requirements.34. The United States, as well as Japan, will have to be brought into any scheme if it is to be made effective. Here there is a better prospect that the UnitedStates, in spite of their neutrality, might be persuaded to collaborate in restrictingtrade with Vladivostock. The United States Administration some weeks agoinvited their exporters to refrain from exporting aeroplanes, aeroplane parts, andcertain ferro-alloys to aggressor countries. If such action on the part of theUnited States authorities could be extended to cover other commodities, includingcopper, which is one of the most important commodities now being exported fromthe United States to Vladivostock, this would be very helpful from the point ofview of the Allies. There are signs that such a development may take place.President Roosevelt had already intimated his keen interest in stopping the supplyof key commodities, such as molybdenum, nickel, copper, tin and rubber, from reaching all aggressor nations. M. Rist and Mr. Ashton-Gwatkin have now arrived in America, and, in addition to discussing the Allied policy as regardseconomic warfare with the interested Government Departments in Washington,they will, it is hoped, find opportunities to pursue with Mr. Morgenthau the exploration of all possible lines of United States collaboration with the Allies inthe control of undesirable exports to dangerous destinations. It is true that thescheme originally propounded by the President and Mr. Morgenthau was intendedto cover all aggressor nations, and was thus aimed at Japan as much as atGermany or Russia, but, if the United States Government can be brought to seethat Japanese acquiescence, if not active co-operation, is essential to the successof the whole scheme, it might be possible to induce them to depart from their original plan to the extent of allowing Japan the supplies needed for her normaldomestic requirements. Moreover, the United States Government, having ridthemselves of their Commercial Treaty with Japan, are in a position to bring pressure to bear to induce the Japanese to adopt a favourable &quot;attitude towardssome scheme which might be acceptable to the Governments of the United States,Great Britain and France, and if the United States would make the continuanceof normal supplies to Japan contingent on the acceptance of such a scheme, itwould greatly strengthen the pressure that the Allies could exercise.* We would, of course, have to take into account the provision of our own needs wberconsidering the terms of any undertaking to supply Japan.
Netherlands East Indies.35. A considerable amount of rubber and tin is now sent from theNetherlands East Indies to Russia and Japan. The quantities reaching Russiaarc greater than Russia&apos;s normal imports. It has been ascertained by an informalenquiry from members of the Dutch Commercial Delegation who have been discussing the War Trade Agreement in London that the Netherlands Govern-ment would be very unlikely to receive favourably a proposal that they shouldrestrict the exports of rubber and tin from the Netherlands East Indies todangerous destinations, as any such restrictions would be contrary to their traditional colonial policy. It is not certain that this need be taken as final. Itwould no doubt be difficult to expect the Netherlands Government to adoptmeasures directed against Germany, but the Netherlands Government have nocommercial relations with Russia and may well be influenced in their policy towards Russia by the attitude of the United States of America. Moreover, it isconceivable that we might be able to make it worth while for the netherlands government to meet our views in this matter. The Netherlands Government, likethe Japanese, want certain German exports for the benefit of the netherlands east Indies; any concession on this point raises, as already stated, a difficultyof principle, but if the Allies were willing to facilitate the passage of the german exports for the Netherlands East Indies through the naval controls, it might bean inducement sufficient to secure the co-operation of the Netherlands East Indiesin the project to restrict exports to Russia, if not to Germany. Anothersuggestion which might be explored is that a rationing system might be devisedin consultation with the international committees for the regulation of rubber and tin.36. In any case, even if a system can be introduced for rationing rubber and tin from the Netherlands East Indies, it will have to be supported by an effectivenaval control; and, in the absence of any such restrictions, a naval control is allthe more necessary. It is understood- that the British Navy alone will shortly be able to spare sufficient vessels to ensure at least a measure of control over this trade, whilst the French naval forces in Far Eastern waters are somewhat more numerous than our own. It will be appreciated that, even if only a few ships were diverted and delayed in Hong Kong, Singapore, Saigon or Haiphong, itwould act as a strong deterrent. It is possible that the evidence of ultimateenemy destination might not be considered strong enough by a British prize court to condemn the shipments, but the vessels might be detained for aconsiderable period while enquiries were being made, even though the cargoeswould probably be released before Prize Court proceedings were instituted. Itmight be well to reach an arrangement with the French authorities for detainedvessels to be taken to a French rather than a British port, owing to the greaterlikelihood of condemnation in the French Prize Courts. It seems desirable thatthe British and French naval authorities should be authorised to act against these rubber and tin consignments from the Netherlands East Indies at an earlydate. For the present, however, it would seem best to avoid interference with japanese and United States vessels engaged in this traffic, in order to avoidirritating opinion in Japan and America at a time when an endeavour is being-made to secure the co-operation of those countries in our attempts to restrict the trans-Siberian traffic. The British and French naval authorities should at firstaim only at the diversion of Russian ships, and possibly also Dutch ships in caseswhere there are very strong grounds for suspicion. But this measure of discrimination cannot be continued indefinitely, or it will have the effect ofdiverting the traffic to the Japanese flag.China.37. It will be very desirable also to reach some understanding with theChinese Government restricting Chinese deliveries to Russia under the Sino-Soviet Barter Agreement. This raises a special problem of some complexity.Under this agreement China has undertaken to send to Russia at least 5,000 tonsof wolfram, 5,000 tons of antimony, 3,000 tons of tin and 50 tons of mercury every year; and in return for these shipments the Soviet Government provide&apos; Chinawith arms and munitions, which are badly needed by the Chinese Governmentin their struggle against Japan. We are thus faced with a dilemma. Our[20975]&quot; d
obligations to the Chinese under one League Resolution are in conflict with our obligations to Finland under another League Resolution. If we stop consign-ments of raw materials which Russia is entitled to receive under her BarterAgreement with China, Russia may cease sending the war material which Chinarequires to continue her resistance against Japan. If, on the other hand, we allowthese commodities to go to Russia, we are assisting an aggressor, even if we cannot,strictly speaking, be said to be weakening Finland&apos;s powers of resistance. Arewe then to hinder China&apos;s efforts to obtain arms from Russia, or are we to allowRussia to obtain raw material which might be used for war purposes againstFinland or be passed on to Germany for use against ourselves ?38. It is difficult to suggest an entirely satisfactory solution of this dilemma.Nor is it necessary, perhaps, to reach a definite decision at the moment. Itmay be wisest to wait, before finally committing ourselves to the Chinese, until it is clearer what sort of arrangement, if any, we shall be able to reach withthe Japanese and the United States authorities. For the present, it may bedesirable to hold up the consignments of wolfram from China to Russia, and toallow the remaining material to proceed, since the wolfram would be so muchmore valuable to Germany for war purposes than the antimony, the tin or themercury. By stopping the wolfram from going to Russia, we would no doubt be acting in the spirit of the League&apos;s Resolution regarding Finland, and wouldalso weaken Russia&apos;s power of assisting Germany, whereas it does not necessarily follow that China would cease to obtain further arms from the Soviet Government,who may continue to supply such arms to China for their own ends.Part 3. The French Governments Request that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould Decide to Seize certain Goods destined for Russia.39. The French Government addressed an important communication to theForeign Office on the 23rd February stating that they had taken a new decision,in accordance with the League Resolution regarding Finland, to exercise a strict control on raw material destined for Soviet Russia which could be used for warmaterial. They referred to the recent Economic Agreement between the U.S.S.R.and Germany, which, they stated, proved the assistance given by the SovietGovernment to the German Government. The French Government had, in thesecircumstances, decided to seize at sea any goods which are particularly adapted for war purposes and do not correspond to normal Russian requirements inpeace time. The French Government had already seized 120 tons of mercuryloaded in Spain for Italy and destined to be transhipped to the U.S.S.R; TheFrench Government attached such importance to this matter that they were readyto assume the risk of having damages awarded against them if the Prize Courtsshould not condemn the goods. Thej^ desired that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould also adopt this policy of stopping goods bound for Russia, and requested that this matter should be discussed by the British Cabinet if any objections were raised to the proposal by the technical Departments concerned.40. It would appear that the French Government, in taking the decisionrecorded in the preceding paragraph, have not appreciated all the practicaldifficulties in the way of applying contraband control to Soviet Russia in theFar East. It would be most undesirable for political reasons (and indeed mightwreck our whole plan) to announce at the present stage such a new departure from the principles of contraband control, or to attempt to apply such measuresto Japanese ships, or to American ships, which might be carrying goods to vladivostock or Dairen. The first step must be to try to reach some under-standing with the Japanese and United States Governments, as proposed above,not to antagonise them. Until we have got the Japanese and United states government into line, it would appear inadvisable to adopt the French proposal.In special cases, when suspicious cargoes are seized, they can be detained whileenquiries are being made into their ultimate destination. If no evidence is forth-coming that these consignments are ultimately destined for Germany, they willbe released, but the detention of the vessel will have served as a warning for other
vessels engaged in the same traffic. It seems unnecessary to go further than this for the present.41. In our reply to the French Governments suggestion, the Foreign Officemight perhaps offer to study the possibility of placing even more stringentrestrictions than at present on the export of articles of contraband from british territory and through British ports to Soviet Russia. We could further offer to explore with the Dominions and India the possibility of forbidding the export toRussia of all articles of contraband. The reply might go on to explain thegeneral outline of a scheme for restricting the Trans-Siberian Railway traffic, asset forth in the preceding paragraphs of this paper; and, finally, might explain that His Majesty&apos;s Government are strongly in favour of postponing any decisionto seize Russian imports, on the lines proposed in the French note of the23rd February, at least until the projected arrangements with Japan and america look like reaching fruition.
