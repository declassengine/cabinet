SECRET.W.P.(G)  (40) 76. Copy No.   ftWAR CABINET.DIVERSION OF CIVIL FLYING BOATS FOR MILITARY DUTIES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.&apos;1.      The War Cabinet will recollect that an experimentalservice across the North Atlantic was successfully operated duringthe early e/ntumn of last year,   We have been planning for the resumption of this service for mails and possibly also for passengers in the coming summer and we had hopes of making a start with a service across the South Atlantic.2.      The North Atlantic service would have been operated inthe first instance with two specially modified flying boats, Cabotand Caribou, and later with three new boats of improved type -Golden Horn, Golden Hind and Golden Fleece.   The South Atlanticservice would have been operated by Cabot and Caribou when freed from the northern service.3.     In November last I agreed, in response to urgentrepresentations by the Air Staff, that Cabot and Caribou should be temporarily diverted for deep sea reconnaissances with a view&apos; tolocating commerce raiders which might at any time break out intothe Atlantic and, in particular, the Deutschland, which was thenbelieved to be on her way home to Germany.4.      The position now is that, owing to the heavy calls onour military flying boats and to the importance to our sea-bornetrade of the work they are doing, the Air Staff, supported bythe Admiralty, feel compelled to ask for the permanent diversion of the Cabot and Caribou and of the three &quot;G&quot; boats for duty withthe Royal Air Force,TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to    Ct ^&quot;ensure the secrecy of this document. ^^2&quot; -\^^

Air Ministry, S..W...1.,11th March. 1940.5.     I propose to accede to this request but the implications-tions, both political and commercial, are of such importance that I think the War Cabinet should be aware of them.6.     In the first place, the diversion will mean that itwill not be possible to operate either a North Atlantic or a south atlantic service this summer.    This will be most disappointing to commercial interests, who have been pressing for an extension ofour air communications.7,     Secondly, it will reduce still further the very slenderreserve of boats behind the Empire services.    The production ofcivil aircraft, and especially of flying boats which are large and expensive, has had to be virtually suspended since theoutbreak of war, and crashed or damaged boats cannot be replaced.If losses are incurred, a reduction in the frequency of the already curtailed Empire services will be inevitable.8.     I am &quot;bringing this matter before the War Cabinet as amatter of urgency as I may be pressed to disclose our intentionswith regard to overseas air services during the debate on theReport stage of the Air Estimates on Thursday of this week.K.W.
