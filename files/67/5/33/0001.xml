Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1940.GSECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 83.March 20, 1940WAR CABINET.DIVERSION OF SHIPPING.Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.AT their meeting on the 5th March the War Cabinet invited me &quot;to super-vise the action of the Departments concerned in this matter and to report further to the War Cabinet if, in my view, additional powers are required to enablerapid progress to be made with the necessary preparations&quot; (W.M. (40)60th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. In fulfilment of this task I have conducted, in collaboration with theMinister of Transport, a rapid but comprehensive review of the plans andarrangements made by the Departments concerned for dealing with a majordiversion of shipping. The Permanent Heads, or senior representatives, of these departments have been separately interviewed and examined on the part each^^Department has to play.fv The Minister of Transport&apos;s Report (W.P. (G.) (40) 82)^4^^^^Ws in some detail the present position of this matter.k towitw iWifc-3. I think, however, that it may be convenient to the War Cabinet if myW^L^o ^report were to present the situation in somewhat broader outline, recommenda-ifrUt^o^ tions being restricted to those aspects of the matter which involve the exercise of&apos;fJl^ additional powers, or in which further efforts are needed to ensure, in the eventcontemplated, the smooth functioning of the machinery, in and behind the ports,for the distribution to their destination of the immense volume of importsrequired for the maintenance of the national life.Pre-war decisions.4. In his report to the Committee of Imperial Defence of the 13th April,1939 (C.I.D. Paper No. 316-A), the then Minister of Transport (Mr. Burgin)warned us of the risks envisaged in the adoption of the general policy of diversionon a wholesale scale. &quot; Sudden diversion (he said) on a large scale cannot butresult in confusion, congestion and delay.&quot; The Committee of Imperial defence at their meeting on the 20th April, 1939, approved a recommendation that thegeneral principle for dealing with overseas imports in time of war should be tomake use, to the greatest possible extent, of normal facilities until prevented from doing so by enemy action, by congestion of the ports, or inland, or by supplyconditions.   (Minutes of 353rd Meeting, Minute 1 (g) (i).)5. The basis of this decision was that at the very outset of a war we mustbe prepared for a lightning air attack on East coast ports and shipping particularly on London at a time when the transport system would be subjected to the exceptional strain imposed by the evacuation scheme and heavy require-ments of the Service Departments for the movement of personnel and material.War experience.6. Apart from day-to-day diversion to meet the wishes of the Ministries ofFood and Supply and of the Petroleum Department, there have been only twoperiods of intensive general diversion.   The first was during the first fortnight[21017]
of the war when the arrivals of ships were considerably below normal. The secondwas for about a fortnight in mid-October 1939. In neither case were exceptionaldifficulties experienced at the ports.7. The experience of the past six and a half months, during which themachinery of diversion has been given what may be described as a &quot; run in,&quot;has demonstrated the soundness of its design; but it has not yet been subjected to a full strain, and the maximum load which can be passed through the Portsis still unknown.Principal Factors Involved.8. Analysis of the Minister of Transports Report will show that no onefactor in the situation can properly be described as a bottle-neck, except the lackof deep-water berths .at the West coast ports. These cannot be extemporized buttake years to provide. A partially completed scheme at Avonmouth is beingaccelerated and will result in new deep-water accommodation for eight ocean-going vessels; similarly, at Glasgow a dock, at present unused, is being equipped and will accommodate three or four large ships (paragraph 14 of w.P. (G.) (40) 82).On the other hand, if complete diversion to the West coast is ordered,transport inland will sooner or later reach saturation point; when this stageapproaches the provision of coasters, into which ocean-going vessels can dischargeoverside, will be of the greatest value. As the Minister of Transport reports,arrangements have been made to ensure the use of the maximum number ofcoasters available for this purpose (Appendix HI to W.P. (G.) (40)82).9. The first essential is thus to secure the utmost use of available deep-water berths on the West coast by day and night working, which in turn depends upon the availability of labour and the provision of adequate lighting facilities.(Paragraphs 9 and 12 of W.P. (G.) (40) 82.)10. It is also of the first importance that the arrangements made shallresult in the removal of goods from the ports as quickly as possible. this involves the use of all available forms of transport, and distribution must, sofar as possible, be planned in advance. As a further stage to avoid congestion in the ports, it is necessary to have alternative storage depots, away from the ports, to which goods can be sent for subsequent distribution to their ultimatedestination.The diversion scheme comprises all these factors. The general arrangements have been worked out on a basis intended to provide for flexibility of working,since it is impossible to foresee the situation which will have to be dealt with.Probable effects of diversion.11. While it is impossible to speak with any certainty in advance, thebest judgment which one can form from the Minister of Transports report is, I think, that if the West coast ports started at normal, the arrangements which have been worked out offer a reasonable prospect that the ports could standa heavy diversion for, say, three weeks or so, before the difficulties of the positionbecame acute. If, however, complete diversion were to last for a prolonged period, the result would be grave congestion in the West coast ports. This does not mean that a state of unmanageable confusion would ensue. It is clear, however,that the rate of imports into the country would be seriously reduced, and shipping would be delayed. By degrees we should adjust ourselves to this slower rateof imports, and we should hope, after a time, with increasing experience, to effect rn improvement on that rate.Further action required.12. The following points raised in the Minister of Transports Reporteither require the exercise of additional powers, or involve further decisions ornegotiations; I fully concur in the recommendations, all of which require urgentaction : (i) Ministry of Supply. The appointment of officers in the ports whowould superintend the removal of goods for which the Ministry areresponsible is an urgent necessity, and Treasury authority is requiredto this end (paragraph (b) of Appendix II of W.P. (G.) (40) 82).

It is doubtful, however, whether this will be practicable. The Minister of Health already has powers of compulsory billeting. It should be understood that, if the need arises,these powers will be exercised promptly (paragraph 9 of W.P. (G.)(40) 82).fffi Customs and Excise Department. Authority is most necessary for theBoard of Customs and Excise to permit them to waive any customs revenue which may be lost as a result of their dispensing with customsexamination at the quays and docks (paragraph 8 of W.P. (G.) (40) 82).13. A further point which is not mentioned in the Minister of TransportsReport, but which does involve the taking of a decision at a later stage, is thefollowing : Diversion to the West coast might produce a temporary surplus of imported meat in the Western areas where existing cold storage accommodation is some-what limited. This might necessitate some slowing up of normal killings ofhome produced animals. On the other hand, it might also lead to a shortage of feeding stuffs in the Eastern Counties owing to pressure on the railway system and the relative difficulty of cross-country working; this would result in a more rapid rate of slaughter, particularly of pigs. The situation can only be dealtwith in the light of the conditions at the time, but the Ministry of Food and theMinistry of Agriculture are fully aware of the position and have agreed toco-operate in steps to meet it at short notice.(Initialled) C.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.
