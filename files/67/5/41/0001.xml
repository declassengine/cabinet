-Printed for tifoeWar Cabinet.  March 1940.SECRET.W.P. (G.) (40) 91.March 29, 1940.WAR CABINET.NAVAL PRIZE MONEY AND PRIZE BOUNTY.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I REGRET that I have to undertake the distasteful task of differing fromthe First Lord of the Admiralty on this subject. We are all at one in our respect and admiration for the magnificent work that is being performed by the officersand men of the Fleet and in appreciating the special position which they occupyin the present phase of hostilities. And none of us wishes to interfere unneces-sarily with the continuance of long traditions. But many traditions becomeoutworn with the passage of time and entirely lose whatever justification theyoriginally had. I should be sorry if the Navy were to cling to a tradition which,it seems to me, is completely out of accord with modern ideas.2. I observe that the First Lord&apos;s case for the grant of prize money andprize bounty to the Navy appears to rest almost entirely on the argument fromtradition. But if this argument is to prevail indefinitely, why, for example, isthe Army denied the proceeds of loot, and why does the Paymaster-General nolonger enjoy the spoils of office? The Royal Navy is a modern Navy and hasabsorbed modern traditions, and I find difficulty in believing that it would be unwilling to recognise that the time has come to discard the tradition of prizemoney and prize bounty.3. Originally the grant of prize money was in the nature of an inducement to encourage the Navy to do its duty, but it would be preposterous to suggest that anything of this kind is necessary to-day. The officers and men of the Navy,like those of the other Services, are properly remunerated for their work, and itwould be entirely anachronistic and out of accord with modern financial principles to allow them to retain in addition the proceeds of their activities m seizingprize, instead of devoting these proceeds to the Exchequer. Distribution of navalprize money and prize bounty appears to be particularly inappropriate undercompulsory service when it is in many cases a matter of accident whether a manfinds himself in one or other of the Services.4. Apart from the objection of principle, the distribution of prize money and prize bounty to the Navy is clearly an invidious and inequitable arrangement on its merits. According to the figures given in the First Lord&apos;s memorandum,the Navy received for the last war more money in prize than in war gratuity. Inother words, they enjoyed proportionately twice the benefits received by the Army.5. I do not see how it is possible to-day to defend an arrangement whereby the Navy, on the one hand, would benefit specially from the fact that its opera-tions result in the capture of enemy property while, on the other hand, theArmy and the Air Force in general would get no corresponding opportunities.It is true, as the First Lord so vividly points out, that up to the present theNavy has been bearing the major brunt of the war, but we cannot assume that[21052]Copy No.   3
this will continue, and, if and when the sacrifices made by the Army and theAir Force become no. less heavy, any justification for. the preferential treatmentof the Navy will entirely disappear. I note, of course, that the First Lord raisesthe question whether the Royal Air Force should not share in the proceeds ofprize money. I should myself regard this as a retrograde step. He naturallydoes not&apos; suggest on what basis distribution should be effected, but whatever it may be the absurdity of the arrangement and the inequality of treatment withthe Army would be accentuated. If the whole of the Air Fprce^is to; share,airmen who have been engaged solely or mainly in co-operation with the army will participate in the proceeds of naval prize, whereas the Army itself will get nothing. If, on the other hand, only those members of the Air Force areto benefit who have taken part in operations over the sea, there will be,. I shouldhave thought, an invidious distinction between different sections of the Force.6. As the First Lord remarks, in the last war the Royal Navy receivedprize money and prize bounty in addition to. war gratuity. If the country can afford it, war gratuity will no doubt be payable at the end of the present war,and I suggest that this is all that naval officers and men may fairly claim.When the three Forces are serving in a common cause, each enduring its ownhardships and making, its own sacrifices, I see no reason why one should receive a double reward.J. S.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.
