This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment.SECRET?W.P.(G)(hO)   969 th April,. 190-0.W A R__C A B I N E T.INDIA AMD THE WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.On March 15 the War Cabinet considered, but decided to defer taking a decision on, the proposals I had submittedwith a view to easing the deadlock in India in my memorandumdated 11th March No. V.P.(G)(ho) 73, and to await a furtherappreciation from&apos;the Governor-General of the situation as it now stands after the meetings of the Congress at Ramgarh on20th March and of the All-India Moslem League at Lahore on2hth March.    I now circulate as Appendix A to thismemorandum the Governor-General&apos;s telegram of 6th Aprilcontaining a statement of his views.2.    As will be seen the Governor-General maintains his recommendation - though perhaps somewhat less decisively -for a policy which he describes as &quot;lying back&quot;? that is tosay, that neither he nor H.M-G. should make any attempt atpresent at all events to make a positive contribution towardsrelieving the situation which has resulted from the actionof the Congress, but should await developments.    I have not thought it necessary to add to the somewhat voluminousdocuments already under the War Cabinet&apos;s consideration by including the text of the Governor-General1s reference to allthe Governors in connexion with his telegram of 6th April andof their replies., On only two points do these telegramsdisclose/CopyV No.    /C

disclose any difference of opinion as to the conclusionsindicated to them by the Governor-General.    Some Governorsfavour the Home Member&apos;s suggestion that a formal warning should be issued by the Government of India to the Congressthat civil disobedience will be rigorously repressed if itshould be initiated, with or without a similar warning thatpreparations for civil disobedience will be prevented:    onthis point I agree unhesitatingly with the Governor-general that such a step  would be likely to have the oppositeeffect to that intended by its advocates.   As. to the. -.Governor-General&apos;s advocacy (if indeed he is to be taken asadvocating this) of something being said in Parliament to thesame effect in the course of the forthcoming debate, I shouldbe against going out of my way to initiate such a warning,but if questioned on the point I should be prepared to saythat the House may be assured that the King&apos;s governmentwill be carried on and that nothing must be allowed tointerfere with the prosecution of the war so far as India isconcerned with it.    The    other point of difference is that sir Roger Lumley, Governor of Bombay, and Sir Henry Craik,Governor of the Punjab, are not at one with the Governor-General on a policy of inaction, and I attach as Appendix Bto this memorandum the relevant extracts from their telegrams3*    The Moslem League&apos;s official adoption of a policyof Partition has introduced an entirely new, and a verydisturbing, feature into the situation.    While I remain ofopinion that mere inaction on our part will never provide asolution of the Indian problem,more especially with the turnit has now taken, nevertheless I agree that at the momentno other course is possible.    The position is complicated bythe imminence of the debates in both Houses on the motionsrequired to legalise the continuance in force beyond the endof this month of the Proclamations xuider which the Governors

2903.of seven Provinces are at present exercising their powers.The latest possible date in the House of Commons within thetime limit, having regard to Budget requirements, has proved to he 18th April, and I have arranged to take themotions in both Houses on that date.    This being so, thereis obviously now no time,  even if this were desired, to concert with the Governor-General and announce on that dateany positive policy;    and even if that were not so I am satisfied that in the situation created by the moslem league&apos;s reply to the Ramgarh Resolution it .is better that the disputants should have some further time forreflexion upon the course their leaders seem to be in process of setting for them before any new factor is introduced into the situation.U.    It follows that I am in agreement with the&apos;Governor-General to this extent, that as matters now standI concede that no good purpose is likely to be served at:  present by the adoption of a plan such as that which Iadvocated in Appendix C to my previous memorandum.    But Iam anxious that I should not be understood on that accountas having changed my view that when the time is ripea solution on the lines I have advocated willrequire serious consideration.&apos; No progress towards a solution of the problem of our relations with india   will,    I   am   convinced,    be possible untilIndians   understand   that    the   first   contribution must come from them in the shape of willingness to discuss and ifpossible to agree upon, the ways and means of governingtheir own country.    But I am no less   convinced thatsuch a result will never be attained until Indians are assured that   whatever they can agree upon amongst themselves,if not accepted without question by us, will at. leastprovide a basis of negotiation between India and.Britain as distinct from dictation by Britain.Zindia Office.

APPENDIX A.Secret Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State for India, datedNew Delhi, April 6, 1940.Immediate.517-S. My appreciation of the position in the light of the working committee&apos;s resolution passed at the meeting in Patna is contained in my telegram of 8th March, No. 358-G. Since its issue the main developments havebeen (a) discussions in the Chamber of Princes on llth-12th March; (6) theRamgarh resolution (in terms identical or practically identical with that passed at Patna) of 20th March; (c) the resolution of the Moslem League on 24th March.There have, in addition, been a variety of statements of more or less importance by prominent political personages, and I have myself had variouscontacts, gist of which has been reported to you, e.g., with Birla, Sultan Ahmed,N. R Sarkar, &amp;c.2. So far as Congress go, the Ramgarh resolution is in effect identical withthat passed at Patna, and comments on it contained in my telegram of 8th Marchhold good. Its importance is, of course, that it represents reaffirmation by congress of its original position, without any modification, after an intervalduring which Congress had the chance of seeing the reactions of the othercommunities and the Princes to the Patna draft. It has had the effect whichI had anticipated of consolidating Gandhi&apos;s position. He is now even more clearly in the saddle than he was previously, and the left wing, while their importance remains, in my judgment, by no means negligible, have definitely not succeeded in shaking his general control of the machine. The impression I getof that control is even more marked than before.3. There is, however, no sign of any modification in stiffness of Gandhi&apos;attitude, or excessive nature of Congress claims as embodied in Ramgarhresolution, with which there is no reason to doubt that he identifies himself. Itis clear, on the other hand, that there is a good deal of uneasiness in the minds of more moderate right wingers such as Birla, &amp;c, who are disturbed at the clear evidence of hardening on the part of other communities. But I would not judgeit at all likely that any such uneasiness will manifest itself in a break away, orin anything but rather plaintive private remonstrances to Gandhi on which hewill take such action as he thinks fit.4. My estimate of hardening of Princely attitude has been confirmed byline of resolution passed in the Chamber and tone of the speeches there made.These were in certain cases outspokenly critical of Congress and of Gandhipersonally. And while the speakers continued to pay lip-service to the idealof Dominion Status, they Avere more insistent than in the past on the necessityfor His Majesty&apos;s Government discharging their treaty obligations to the States,and on the necessity for their being fully associated with any constitutional changes. The Patna resolution was in my judgment clearly responsible for thisstiffening in their attitude.5. The more important developments have, however, been in relation tothe Moslems. The Moslem League, under Jinnah, met at Lahore on 21st March-24th March. The meeting was preceded by this unfortunate incident withKhaksars which for a short time made it just possible that a postponement would take place, and which resulted in discussions taking place in an atmosphere of severe internal strain, Sikendar and his Government coming in for a gooddeal of criticism from sympathisers with Khaksars, and Jinnah having a difficulthand to play to maintain unity of the League. Jinnah, in fact, played his cardswith great skill and avoided any split which would have embarrassed Sikendar.The resolutions passed at meeting, text of which is already available to you,were categorical in their insistence on consultation with Moslem League and onits concurrence in connection with constitutional change; refusal to accept any constitutional scheme which involved a Hindu majority at the centre; hostility to scheme of federation to Act, and, not least significant, a veiled but definitethreat that there would be trouble (? even in the) field of provincial autonomy if[21108] B
Congress Ministries return to Office without steps having been taken to meetMoslem grievances. Finally, Moslems put forward what purports to be their ownconstructive solution of Indian difficulties based on theory of two nations, viz.,proposals for a partition of India into predominantly Moslem and predominantlyHindu areas.6. I am myself disposed to regard Jinnah&apos;s partition scheme as very largely in the nature of bargaining. I think he has put forward this scheme, the manyobjections to which I need not set out here, partly to dispose of reproach thatMoslems had no constructive scheme of their own; partly to offset the extremeCongress claim to independence, &amp;c. : and Congress contention that Congressis the mouthpiece of India; and that a Constituent Assembly on the basis of adult suffrage is the only machinery for deciding future progress, as put forward in the Ramgarh resolution. That many Moslems are unhappy about the partitionscheme I have no doubt, more particularly Moslems in the minority provinces.That it may lose some non-Moslem support for Jinnah is clear from the speechesby, e.g., Chhotu Ram in the Punjab, and by Sikh protests that they will not readily submit to Moslem domination. But at the present stage my impression(confirmed by reports from the Governors referred to in paragraph No. 7 below)is that, while the scheme will be much criticised, and rightly so, there is a gooddeal of feeling that it is bargaining in character, and very considerable doubtapart from that whether many Moslems of substance could face up to Jinnahover it. Sikendar, I am certain, does not, like the scheme; but he is not in astrong enough position in the light of the Khaksar incident to fight Jinnah.I would myself agree with Craik&apos;s estimate that the effect of Lahore has been to a remarkable degree to increase Jinnah&apos;s prestige and to consolidate his positionas an all-India Moslem spokesman, and with the view reported by Stewart thatunsound as partition idea may be, it is one which will get into the heads of very large numbers of Moslems and may prove increasingly difficult to dislodge.I get the general impression that Moslems, in the light of Lahore and despite the internal dissensions connected with the Khaksar movement, are in a far more confident and resolute mood that they have hitherto been. I am perfectly clear as to the seriousness of the factor which this hardening on their partrepresents; and I am confirmed in the view expressed in my telegram of 8th Marchof the difficulty of ignoring or overriding it and the necessity for giving full consideration to Moslems&apos; claims.7. Before sending my present appreciation I thought it well to give allGovernors an opportunity to express their views. I consulted them on a personalbasis in general terms. The text of my reference to them went to you by themail of the 29th March. I am telegraphing their replies in full so as to putyou fully in possession of their views. I need not, therefore, summarise these telegrams here. But I think it not unfair to say that they appear to accept my own appreciation of the position as substantially justified : that they bring out(a) the increased hardening and importance of the Moslem element and attitude(compare in particular views expressed by United Provinces, Punjab, Bihar andBengal, and relevance of fact that the Punjab and Bengal are working provincial autonomy); (b) that an immediate outbreak of civil disobedience appears on thewhole unlikely, given the absence of terrorism, the absence of economic crisis,the fact that there is no very strong and compelling motive behind civildisobedience which will appeal to the public generally, though general sense of governors&apos; replies is that Congress constituents would rally to an appeal for civil disobedience even though without enthusiasm, and Hallett thinks that it is bound ultimately to come; (c) that civil disobedience is very likely to involvecommunal trouble where minority community is of any size. Hallett anticipatesthat it would be serious : Craik that it would almost certainly lead to communaltrouble; as does Stewart, though he does not think trouble would be widespread :Lumley regards it as probably likely to create (\ conditions) in which there mightbe outbreaks : Herbert that if it was not soon crushed it would lead to communaltrouble; and communal trouble would be likely in Madras, though not on a veryserious scale; (d) that desirable in principle as some gesture on our part might balfour circumstances were favourable, the wise course (subject to remarks inparagraph 13 below on Lumley&apos;s views) is for the present to continue to lieback.
8. I have again most carefully reviewed whole position in the light of developments since my telegram of the 8th March and of views expressed byGovernors.   I have had particularly in mind :  (i) the arguments for and against formal warning to Congress, (a) that civil disobedience in time of war will not be permitted, and /or (&amp;),a formal warning to them that they will not be permitted to proceedwith preparations for civil disobedience :(ii) The question discussed in my telegram of the 8th March, viz., whetherbetter course would be to lie back or whether any move or gestureon our part and if so what is practicable and desirable :(iii) The extent to which any modification in general Congress attitude is -to be looked for now that Ramgarh is over and that we are on thepoint of going to Parliament for an extension of Section 93proclamation :(iv) Points (? omission) might be of assistance to you in any debate onSection 93.9. My views in the outcome are as follows : as regards point (i) (a) I put this in terms to Governors. I indicated to them, as you will see, that I wasnryself doubtful, for reasons set out in my telegram to them of the 29th March,as to the case for a warning to Congress : and I said that a pretty broad hint,preferably given in Parliament, in a debate on Section 93, that civil disobediencewill not be permitted in war-time, would be the furthest I would myself be disposed to go. I think it fair to say that Governors&apos; replies, I await Wylie&apos;scomment only, but in view&quot; of urgency have not delayed issue of this appreciation,show that their general sense is averse from action. Bihar, Orissa and Madraswould, as I read it, be prepared to go as far as I suggested to them, viz., abroad hint in Parliament. Hallett is strongly opposed and thinks that not evena hint is called for so far as India is concerned and that any reference necessary from point of view of right-wing opinion in Parliament should be carefullyguarded. The Punjab take line that any hint would be better privately giventhan public. Sind equally is opposed to a Parliamentary announcement andthinks that any hint had better be private. &apos; The North-West Frontier Provinceand Bombay are against any action.10. On the other hand, my Home Member remains, in the light of Governors&apos;replies, of his previous view that there would be advantage in making it definitelyand positively clear to Congress that civil disobedience will not be tolerated inwar-time. A statement on these lines would in his judgment do much to counteract Congress efforts to create an atmosphere for civil disobedience and,while making our attitude clear to the moderate elements and services, give a leadto public opinion and show that we were not on the defensive or likely to letourselves be driven from point to point. I must of course pay the greatestweight to Maxwell&apos;s judgment, given his great experience and his balance. but with the utmost reluctance to differ from him and after full consideration Iadhere, in agreement with Hallett, now that I have had the benefit of the governors&apos; views, to my view that a broad hint of a non-provocative character ina debate on Section 93 such as Hallett suggests, viz., the inherent character ofcivil disobedience as shown on the last occasion; and the necessity of allowing no interference with the conduct of the war, is furthest we could wisely go. Ithink that the Governors generally are right in thinking that it is pretty widely accepted that we could not tolerate civil disobedience in war-time; and I amimpressed by their references to that fact and by the almost unanimous feeling of the unwisdom of anything that could be represented as a challenge or used as a pretext by Congress for a break. There is a good deal in Cunningham&apos;s point about the skill of Congress in misinterpreting any announcement by us.11. As regards a warning against preparations, again in the light of governors&apos; views, I am myself satisfied that wise course would be to give nowarning, continue to keep closest watch on all action preparatory to civildisobedience and to make full and prompt use of the law in suppressing unlawfulactivities. There is, as you will see from their replies, considerable identity ofview among Governors as to the case for dealing with this side simply by pickingup offenders as they transgress the law. As in the case of alternative discussed Inpreceding paragraph, there is widely expressed acceptance of objections to[21108] &apos; &apos; b 2
throwing down any challenge to Congress, or providing them with a target. Ihave given full weight to argument that action on our part might heartennon-Congress elements, and to arguments for positive action by us. But havingmost carefully examined them with assistance of Governors&apos; views, my ownconclusion is as stated above.12. To turn now to point (ii) in paragraph No. 8 above, I need not say howconcerned I have been to satisfy myself in again reviewing the situation whether there is any action, and if so what, which we could at this stage profitably andwisely take. The general sense of Governors&apos; replies supports my own earlierview that we should be wiser to make no move in the political field. Specificsuggestions in the political field have been made by Craik and Lumley. As forCraik&apos;s suggestions, I, of course, wholly agree that it must be our policy tocontinue to try to promote agreement here. But there will have to be a considerableeasing off on the part both of Congress and Moslem League before we should bejustified in moving actively. I regard Craik&apos;s comment as more important asbringing out, from the point of view of Moslem Province, the type of concessions which he thinks would be called for to make accommodation between Moslems and congress possible. It would clearly involve a very substantial sacrifice by congress, even on the basis of the Act of 1935.13. Lumley&apos;s suggestion for a further endeavour to get a conference togetheris, as you know, one which has been very much in my mind from time to time,and I have again done my best to consider objectively whether there might notbe something to be said for it. He advances good tactical reasons for making the move, and I accept their force. For all that, giving the suggestion the bestconsideration I can, I remain definitely averse from any move of this type at thepresent stage. I by no means exclude considered action on these lines at some later point. But I am certain that, if we move in this field before conditions arefavourable to our doing so, we shall merely make matter worse rather than better.A premature attempt of this nature, particularly if one or both parties decline toparticipate save on terms unacceptable to the other, or to us, might be of assistancefrom propaganda point of view, but on a longer view would, in my judgment, belikely to set matters back as regards any arrangement between parties, and to dono good to our prestige. There is already a good deal of suggestion that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are concerned only to come to terms with Congress; thatthey will run after Congress in almost any circumstances; and that they will atany time be ready to sacrifice the remaining interests in the country if they canonly conciliate Congress opponents. That is not the case. But fact that idea isin people&apos;s minds is relevant to course to be adopted by us.14. Nor am I, having again considered matter, at this stage in favour of considering, before reaching agreement with Congress, either the expansion ofmy Council or establishment of a Consultative Committee. I do not believe weshall get Congress to play on either. Both (and more particularly the first)represent valuable concessions, and to throw them into the pool without somecertainty of Congress taking advantage of them would be to leave us with still less to bargain with when the time comes for getting down to business with congress. I will consult Governors separately as regards case for non-official advisers now that Section 93 looks like being prolonged, but rather anticipate that they will be against (cf., remarks in Hallett&apos;s telegram 31st March and hope&apos;s of 3rd April). My considered opinion in these circumstances and in thelight of views expressed by Governors is that for the present we should continueto mark time. We should, however, continue equally to maintain such privatecontacts as are open to us, and be ready to take advantage of any improvementin the situation, or any change in the attitude of the principal parties, whichholds out hope of bringing them more closely together and of producing agreement.I (? omission) how greatly I regret that this should be the case. But equally,and with a full sense of responsibility, I feel it my duty to bring out the strengthof the argument as I see it, against any early move. I suspect that this situation has got to develop still further as between the parties, before there is muchlikelihood of either coming to their senses; and a series of ineffective attempts at intervention on our part is likely, if anything, to reduce the strength of our intervention or our assistance to secure agreement when circumstances favourable for that present themselves.
15. As regards point (iii) in paragraph No. 8 above possibility of a modification in general Congress attitude--I fear that as mentioned in paragraphNo. 3 above, I see no present sign of this. I think Lumley is probably right inhis suggestion in paragraph No. 2 (b) of his telegram of the 2nd April that congress by their present threats hope to blackmail us into further concessionswhile hoping not to have to implement their threats, though I agree with himalso that they are creating an atmosphere in their own ranks in which it willbe difficult for them to climb down. There may well, too, be something in suggestionthat they hope that if we suffer a reverse, or become deeply engaged, in the West,we shall be more pliable, though for reasons given in paragraph 14 of my telegramof the 8th March I do not regard that argument as well founded. I suspectGandhi of conducting at the moment a war of nerves in which he will return anentirely polite but completely negative answer to any forward move on our part short of his full demand, hoping that if he can keep this up long enough,we shall get rattled and that other communities and interests in this country will be all the more shaken by any concession or move which we may be persuaded to make, and all the more convinced of capacity of Congress to squeeze us.16. As regards point (iv) in paragraph No. 8 above, you are of course thebest judge of what arguments are likely to be of value in any debate. But I may perhaps indicate briefly my own view of considerations which might be worthemphasising from the standpoint of reactions here. As a preliminary point,there is, I think, force in Sarker&apos;s suggestion to me that, if that could be secured,sorrow rather than anger should be the note of discussion. I think it important to bring out again by a quotation in both Houses (perhaps in terms of communique issued after my talk with Gandhi on the 6th February), as well as in theWhite Paper, which I have separately suggested to you, if you accept thatsuggestion, the nature of the offer we have made and its great generosity; thatwith the best will in the world to reach Dominion Status as early as possible,His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot ignore or override the views and interests ofthe minorities, particularly the Moslems, and Princes; that impasse which hasnow been reached is not due to any failure on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, who have nothing whatever with which to reproach themselves in the eyes of India or of the world. That we did, indeed, succeed in bringing the leadersof the two principal parties together last November, but that the intransigeanceof one party then made further progress impossible; that since then increasing demands by Congress have made position still more difficult, and have resulted ina definite strengthening of critical opposition of two elements who cannot be ignored and whose feeling must be given fullest weight to in any settlement which may be reached, viz., the Princes and Moslems; that there is no reasonto think minorities such as scheduled castes, &amp;c, are not equally disturbed by congress claim; that these more recent developments have brought out more clearly than ever lack of any substance for Congress claim to be accepted as themouthpiece of India; and that it is obvious that any settlement which is to lastand any constitutional progress for India must be preceded by internal agreement and a greater readiness on the part of the principal parties in this country to strike a balance.17. It is, I suggest, important also (from the (? Indian Government^) pointof view as well as generally) to bring out that we have never at any stagedemanded 100 per cent, agreement between the parties as a condition of advance,and that in connection with the proposals put to Congress and the Moslems inNovember it was made clear in terms that it ought not to be necessary absolutelyto resolve every detail of such differences as may exist in the provinces, and thatwe asked the parties to reach such resolution of those differences as would makedevising a scheme for harmonious co-operation at the Centre possible. I suggestthat (as in your broadcast of 3rd April) we should play up to middle positionopinion here, and in particular assure India that present difficulties will (1 in no way) diminish the desire or intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to establishat the earliest possible moment self-government within the Commonwealth ofNations; that we should reiterate our own readiness to lend any help, make(? some) play with the extent to which we have already tried to bridge the widening gulf between the communities, and while expressing our regret thatnormal constitutional working of scheme of provincial autonomy should beinterrupted in many provinces, and that its interruption should now have to be
further prolonged through circumstances outside our control, bring out that itis working smoothly and well elsewhere, and that though it may contain defects,experience has shown that they are not fundamental in character.18. As for future government of India as a whole, that we should draw attention to our continued insistence on the importance of Indian unity which you and I have repeatedly stressed, and express our regret that widening gap between communities and interests, consequent on attitude which Congress hasadopted towards minorities, and towards the Princes, should constitute so seriousa threat and a set-back to that unity. There is much that could be said in criticism of Jinnah&apos;s partition ideas and we clearly could not accept or endorse them.But quite apart from the fact that we have left the whole scheme and policy ofthe Act open for discussion after the war, and that Jinnah&apos;s scheme itself has, Isuspect, largely been provoked by unreasonable demands of Congress, any con-condemnation of Jinnah&apos;s scheme will at once irritate Moslem feeling and will be seized on by Congress. In present temper here I would myself, therefore, thinkit preferable to quote it as illustrating extent to which the gulf has widenedbetween the parties, and to take line that His Majesty&apos;s Government attachedall the more importance in such circumstances to reaching a solution, with agree-ment of all parties, which would secure the unity of India.19. If there is any further material which would be of use, or if there are any further points on which you would wish me to comment, please telegraph assoon as possible.
APPENDIX B.A.    Extract from telegram dated 2nd April from the governor of Bombay (Sir Roger Lumley)  to the Governor-General.h.      Although this position is none of our seeking, Congressis obviously anxious to fasten the blame on us.    in considering therefore the line to be taken in the immediatefuture the crucial point in my view is that it should beplain to the whole world that the obstacle in the way of constitutional advance is not our obstruction but disagreementamong Indians themselves.    This may be plain enough alreadyfor those who follow Indian affairs closely, but I stillthink that Congress, with its caxoacity for clouding issues,,can succeed in convincing many people in India and elsewhere,that it is we who are behind the opposition to their claims.For this reason I think that it would still be premature forus to throw out a challenge to Congress.    The opportunity,which some persons press us to take now, to come out instrong opposition to Congress, will come if Congress makesconflict inevitable, but I would leave it to Congress to precipitate the conflict, and before that point is reachedI would continue to do everything to make our position before the world so cast-iron as to be unassailable.5*    I would therefore advocate taking some further step withpurpose of fastening responsibility for a continuance ofdeadlock where it really lies.    Possibly the calling of aconference of a few leaders on the ground that presentposition contains dangerous potentialities which we are allanxious to avoid, would serve this purpose.    If Congressdeclines,  the resxoonsibility for banging the door could belaid clearly on them.If Conference meets, I feel sure that bulk of opinion in this country would anxiously look to it to produce asettlement.    That in itself might conceivably lead each side to compromise rather than be held responsible for failure,especially if Congress is really not too happy about its position and if Jinnah has begun to. see that his partitionproposals have met with a very poor reception.    If, however,it fails,  the differences between Indians would have been further heavily underlined as real obstacle to progress, andopinion, here in particular and also abroad, would be moreinclined to discount Congress propaganda and to conclude that Congress had no moral justification for civildisobedience.6.    I would emphasise that I advocate a step of this sort for the purpose of bringing out more clearly than everwhat is real difficulty in the way of further advance.    i recognise, however, that Congress may so force the pace inthe next few weeks that we may be compelled to take actionagainst them.    If that point is reached I am quite clear,that whatever the reactions here or abroad we must takestrong and immediate action.    I would hope, however, that congress, reluctant to embark on a struggle under presentconditions, will give sufficient time for a step of thiskind to be taken.B./

B.    Extract from telegram dated 1st-April from the governor of the Punjab (Sir Henry Graik) to the Governor-General.9.    As regards the general line of policy to befollowed in existing circumstances, I venture to suggestthat we should not remain entirely passive.    If we simplyallow the situation to develop. I fear that the result willhe either outbreak of civil disobedience or a steadywidening of breach between the two major communities,  tillall hope of bridging it vanishes.    Left to their owndevices they are unlikely to put forward any constructivesuggestions for solution of their differences.    A positiveand persistent effort on our part to bring them together and to suggest solutions for their consideration seems to berequired.10.    The crux of whole problem is question of Hindudomination at Centre.    Moslems will not tolerate this, norany method of framing a constitution (evg. a constituentassembly whose decisions would be determined by a majority vote) which might produce this result.    It is impossiblefor His Majesty&apos;s Government, especially when in close alliance with Islamic countries, to overlook Moslem attitude on this matter.    Apart&apos; from other considerations, to do so would sooner or later involve the country in civil war.It seems therefore that we should spare no effort(a) to persuade Congress that constitutional advance must beon lines acceptable to Moslems and that if they ignore this,they will be running their heads against a wall, and (b) toremove suspicion that we hope to exploit this fact in orderto retain our hold on this country.11.    Gandhi has recently written that if his projectedconstituent assembly failed to reach an agreement it would automatically be dissolved.    &quot;An agreed solution would beits sole sanction&quot;.    This suggests that he is open toargument and that (a) above is not an impossible task.While any public pronouncement or overtures might do more harm than good persistent attempts at persuasion throughprivate channels might usefully be made.As regards (b) above the best earnestness of sincerity of our intentions would be for ourselves to show that we are trying to assist India&apos;s constitutional advance by devisingsolutions for communal problem at Centre.   What would seemto be required are various alternative constitutionalexpedients such as would ensure at Centre something in thenature of a Coalition Government.    Suggestions would have tobe conveyed privately at any rate to begin with.12.    Action on above lines might prevent situation fromrapidly deteriorating.    It might also be efficacious laterif a break came as evidence of sincerity of our promise ofDominion status.13*    I would also suggest that in any debate inParliament it should be made clear that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s offer of Dominion status still holds good;that we are ready to implement it as soon as the princesand peoples of India can agree as to form of constitution and that we are doing all that we can to promote agreement.
