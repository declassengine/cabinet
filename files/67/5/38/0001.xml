(40) 88.March 26, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy off this document.WAR CABINET.CONTRABAND CONTROL IN THE FAR EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues an aide-memoire on the subject of con-traband control in the Far East, which has been communicated semi-officially tothe French Embassy in London, with a view to serving as a basis for discussion at the meeting of the Supreme War Council on the 28th March.H.Foreign Office, March 26, 1940.Aide-memoire.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have given their most careful considerationto the aide-memoire No. 88 which the French Ambassador was so good as to com-municate to them on the 23rd February on the subject of the attitude which theAllied Governments should take towards the consignment of certain commodities to the U.S.S.R.2. The particular case of the s.s. Selenga will form the subject of a separatecommunication, but His Majesty:s Government have had under examination thegeneral question of the extension to the Soviet Union of the control of contrabandand enemy exports now exercised as against Germany, and have reached thefollowing conclusions : -(a) The U.S.S.R. can give economic help to Germany in two ways: by providing raw materials and food-stuffs of domestic origin and byfacilitating transit trade between Germany and other neutral countries across Soviet territory.(b) The Trade Agreements concluded between Germany and the U.S.S.R.have at present little more than political and propaganda value. Thenature and volume of goods delivered will be governed by Sovietwillingness and ability to place the goods required at Germany&apos;disposal.10945   [21032]
yc) Although Russian supplies to Germany since the outbreak of war have so far been of little significance, efforts now being made, especially by the Germans, to improve transportation facilities may succeedduring 1941 in largely counteracting Allied economic pressure in other directions, provided that the U.S.S.R. is not herself engaged in a major war and the present rate, of consumption in Germany is not increased.(d) It is not possible to limit Soviet sales of domestic produce to germany by means of a War Trade Treaty, pre-emptive action, or other meansopen directly to the Ministry of Economic Warfare.(e) Of the four routes whereby transit trade across the U.S.S.R. reachesGermany two are at present of minor importance, namely, the land(and air) route from Central China and the railway route fromAfghanistan.(/) Supplies of some value are reaching Germany from Iran and Turkey via the Black Sea. Interception of these would only seem possible wereit feasible to exercise contraband control in that sea. Such a measure would also reduce the supplies of Soviet domestic produce to Germany,especially of manganese and petroleum, which are known to be coming forward by this route. Unfortunately, under the provisions of theMontreux Straits Conventions, passage into the Black Sea is forbidden to all belligerent warships if Turkey is neutral. This seems to rule out any possibility of Allied contraband control being exercised inthe Black Sea, except with Turkey&apos;s connivance (which is unlikely tobe forthcoming so long as she maintains her neutrality).(g) Germany, with Russian consent, is making great efforts to import fromthe American Continent and Asia, via Vladivostock or Dairent andthe Trans-Siberian Railway, deficiency commodities of relatively high price and great value to her in the prosecution of the war. There is evidence of rubber reaching Germany by this route and a prima faciepresumption that copper, ferro-alloys and other materials of highimportance are being delivered or might be delivered to Germany bythe same means. Even a certain amount of so bulky a commodity as, soya beans has been forwarded by this route.(h) The transport capacity placed at Germany&apos;s disposal, which may beincreased as soon as rolling-stock now under construction in Germanybecomes available, can probably handle a sufficient weight of thespecial commodities envisaged to suffice to meet German essential needs.(i) An attempt to stop German transit trade over the Trans-siberian railway implies an attempt to restrict the trade of the two ports ofVladivostock and Dairen. Steps should be taken to organise appro-priate naval action, so far as possible, but it appears unlikely that effective control can be established without some collaboration from japan and the United States of America. Collaboration with theGovernment of the Netherlands East Indies would also be desirable,but seems most unlikely to be obtainable.3. It seems clear, therefore, that in principle the extension of contrabandand enemy export control anyhow to Asiatic Russia is highly desirable. Theextent to which this control can be carried out raises certain difficulties, both political and practical.4. On the political side, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the AlliedGovernments have to weigh carefully the policy which should be adopted towardsthe U.S.S.R. While they feel no doubt that Soviet vessels carrying contrabandof Enemy destination should be subject to the full exercise of Allied belligerentrights, it appears to them questionable whether it would be advisable to interceptvessels and seize their cargoes simply because they were carrying contraband to vladivostock. The Government of the U.S.S.R. are known to be importing thebulk of their own requirements of raw materials by this route, and no doubt theywould be ready to guarantee that all and every consignment imported by this route was destined to Russia for her domestic consumption. In that even this Majesty&apos;s Government are advised that the British Prize Court would be unlikely to condemn such goods unless adequate evidence were forthcoming to
rebut the presumption of innocence thus created.. Prize Law could not normallyadmit of the seizure of goods consigned to a neutral country which guaranteedthat they would not be re-exported to the enemy, and to adopt the practice ofseizing such goods would be tantamount to treating the neutral country concerned as itself an enemy. The wide political implications involved will be appreciatedby the French Government, but, apart from these wider considerations, HisMajesty&apos;s Government feel that such action might weaken the actual operationof the blockade. Up to the present there is no reason to believe that the U.S.S.R.are prepared to jeopardise the interests of their national economy in order toprovide supplies, of which they themselves are short, to Germany, and if this isthe case, it might be inexpedient to take action which might force the U.S.S.R.into closer relations with Germany.5. For these reasons His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that while contra-band control should be applied so far as possible to vessels trading with far eastern ports, as in the case of other countries, it should be directed to inter-intercepting vessels carrying goods in respect of which there is some evidence of enemy destination. The evidence should, if possible, be material evidence ofGerman interest in the particular cargo, but it might be possible to found a caseon statistical information showing wholly abnormal imports into the U.S.S.R.for which no adequate explanation is obtainable. It would, however, certainly,in their opinion, be inadvisable to divert or to detain Japanese or Americanvessels without definite evidence to justify their interception. Subject to these considerations, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the two Admiraltiesshould be invited to concert together with a view to the institution of contraband control so far as possible in Far Eastern waters.6. The Allies do not dispose at present of adequate naval forces in theFar East which could intercept on the high seas all vessels carrying contrabandto Vladivostock and Dairen, nor are these bases so situated as to enable vesselsthat may be intercepted in the Northern Pacific to be diverted without greatinconvenience. It may be immediately practicable to stop ships in.the SouthChina seas carrying rubber and tin from the Netherlands East Indies, and tocontrol exports from Thailand and the Philippines, but it would certainly notbe possible, if only for political reasons, to intercept Japanese ships in the watersadjacent to Japan. It would also be difficult for the Allied naval controls, forgeographical reasons, to stop and divert United States ships carrying cargoesto Vladivostock. It is,- in fact, essential, if any effective restriction is to beplaced upon the trade of Vladivostock and Dairen, that Allied naval measures should be supplemented by some kind of understanding with Japan and theUnited States. Moreover, any untimely interference now with vessels sailingunder their flags might seriously jeopardise the chances of reaching such an understanding in the future.7. In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government it might be possible to arriveat some agreement with the Japanese Government to limit supplies sent to Russiaor Germany via the Trans-Siberian Railway, if the Allies were to make this a condition of the supply to Japan of her normal consumption of the rawmaterials produced in their respective Empires. If all the elements of a bargainwere not then present, it might perhaps be possible to grant Japan some smallconcessions in the matter of the passage through the Allied contraband controlsof some of the material which she is anxious for defence purposes to importfrom Germany. His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, would not, nor theypresume, would the French Government, be willing to purchase Japaneseco-operation in this matter by any substantial deviation from the attitude whichthey have taken up in regard &quot;to Japan&apos;s actions or intentions in China.8. As regards complementary action by the United States, it had appearedat one time that there might be some hope of securing this as an extension ofthe President&apos;s plans for denying key commodities to aggressor nations. Fromthe reports furnished by the Rist-Gwatkin mission, however, it would seem that the Administration are now unwilling to go as far in this direction as seemed possible some months ago. Nevertheless, it is understood that the Adminis-tration is studying the facts regarding abnormal imports into Russia, and itmay be that if they are supplied with the fullest possible information showinghow important actually and potentially the traffic over the Trans-Siberian Rail-
Foreign Office, March 26, 1940.way is, they may be led to recognise how vital is some measure of parallelaction by the United States, if the Siberian leak is to be stopped. The UnitedStates Government should be kept informed of the policy adopted by the AlliedGovernments, but it is not suggested that any direct proposals should be put to them in this matter. His Majesty&apos;s Government hope, however, that theUnited States Government may just possibly be moved spontaneously to takeparallel action in the desired direction, ostensibly as part of their declared policyof denying war material to aggressor nations.9. To sum up, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Government are of the opinionthat the application of contraband control to Asiatic Russia should be effected in stages. The first step is to restrict the export to the U.S.S.R. of all com-modities on the contraband list derived from the British or French Empires.Drastic restrictions have been imposed on exports from the United Kingdom,British Colonies, India and certain of the Dominions. Subject to the FrenchGovernment agreeing to adopt the same policy as regards the French Empire,Flis Majesty&apos;s Government propose to approach His Majesty Governments inthe Dominions and the Governments of India and Burma with a request thatthey should impose similar restrictions in so far as they have not already done so. It is proposed that any complaints from the Soviet Union should be met with a reply that the commodities in question cannot be exported owing to domestic needs and military necessities. If the French Government can see their way to enforce similar restrictions throughout the French Empire, as HisMajesty&apos;s Government hope they will, there should result a sensible diminutionin the supply of some of the more important commodities which the soviet union might pass to Germany through Siberia. At the same time the allied naval authorities in the Far East could be instructed to arrange for the diversion,preferably into Indo-Chinese ports, of any vessels from the Philippines, Nether-lands East Indies, &amp;c, thought to be carrying cargo of enemy destination, if their interception is practicable.10. With a view to the completion of the second stage, both the AlliedGovernments should endeavour to reach some understanding with the ChineseGovernment in the matter of Chinese exports to Russia and should examinetogether how best to induce the Japanese Government to agree to the strictestpossible limitation of. goods carried in Japanese ships or on Japanese-controlledrailways and destined for Soviet Russia. Simultaneously the Ambassadors in washington, Professor Rist and Mr. Ashton Gwatkin should be furnished withall material calculated to move the United States Government to take parallelaction and, if possible, lead them to admit the necessity of Japanese co-operation.11. His Majesty&apos;s Government will be glad to learn whether the FrenchGovernment find themselves in agreement with the foregoing and, if so, whetherthey will be prepared for their part to act along the lines proposed.
