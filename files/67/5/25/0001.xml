COPY HO.        i:WAR     C A B I IT E T.NEGOTIATIONS TO SECURE THE USE OF ADDITIONALNORWEGIAN TANKERS.Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping.1.    I submit for urgent consideration by the War Cabinet theattached Memorandum requesting authority to commencenegotiations immediately with the Norwegian Government with theobject of securing on time charter Norwegian tankers in additionto those to he delivered under the Shipping Arrangement made inNovember between my Ministry and the Norwegian ShipownersAssociation.2.    It is estimated that there are about fifty Norwegiantankers that might be available for chartering and the object ofthe negotiations would be to secure the whole of these or as manyof them as possible.5.    Owing to the competition with neutral charterersparticularly on account of the United States and Italy there isno possibility of obtaining our object except by negotiationswith the Norwegian Government, and I see no prospect   of success in such negotiations unless we are able to offerj-(a) to help the Norwegian Government with their armamentsprogramme and, if possible,(b) to arrange for some relaxation of the system of calls of norwegian vessels at Kirkwall in suitable cases;4.    For the reasons explained in the Memorandum it is vital toour war effort to obtain these additional Norwegian, tankers;    andin my opinion the importance of the case justifies an exceptionaleffort to concede something on these points in .return for asatisfactory Agreement regarding tankers.J.O.Ministry of Shipping.11th March, 1940.

NORWEGIAN TANKERS.WORLD TANKER SITUATION.1.   At the outbreak of war the tanker tonnage of the worldwas about equal to carrying normal requirements .    Under war conditions pressure on tanker tonnage results from inevitabledelays to shipping., the war requirements of the Allies and the attempts of neutral countries as a precautionary measure tobuild up large stocks of oil.    Despite the reduced demand for civil needs the world shortage of tanker tonnage has alreadybecome acute, with the result that market rates have increasedfour hundred to five hundred per cent, over pre-war,2o Most important oil importing countries have tankers under their own flag, but even in normal times the United Kingdom and france, the United States, Japan and Italy charter tanker tonnageof other flags to supplement their own tankers.Norway is the only country which possesses any substantialtonnage of tankers normally seeking employment on the market forother than national needs,3o The Norwegians own about 250 ocean-going tankers of about,500,000 deadweight tons.    Under the Shipping Arrangement with Norway 134 of these tankers of 1^- million d-eadweight tons are orwill be chartered to Allied charterers.    The rates are subject toadjustment every six months.   An additional ten tankers of120,000 tons deadweight will also be chartered to the Allies atthe same rates under the War Trade Agreement,  in return for theagreement of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the export of anadditional 50,000 tons of fish from Norway to Germany.    Thisleaves 105 Norwegian tankers, of which it is estimated that 30are required for the, Scandinavian countries,  including Denmark.There are about 30 Norwegian tankers operating for Americancharterers under pre-war long term charters.    The present freesupply of Norwegian tankers is consequently about 60 tankers of500,000 tons deadweighte

OBJECT OF SECURING ALLIED CONTROL OP ADDITIONAL NORWEGIAN TANKERS.4. The latest estimates show that the Allies are short of from60 to 100 tankers.    Even if these estimates prove to be on thehigh side, there must, on any calculation remain a substantialdeficiency, which cannot be met except by securing an additionalnumber of Norwegian tankers and by arranging a drasticre-distribution of supplies so as to secure that oil is drawn from the nearest sources of supply.    The latter course raises verydifficult financial and political questions, as it involves a heavy reduction in the amount of oil drawn from Iran and acorresponding increase in the amount drawn from Venezuela and theGulf of Mexico.    Some re-distribution will be necessary, but themore Norwegian tankers we can get the less drastic will it have tobe.5. The demand from Neutral charterers such as the United States,Italy and Japan is inevitably concentrated upon the same 50Norwegian tankers not already under our control or required forScandinavian countries.6. The Ministry of Shipping recently made a strong attempt toavoid the undesirable consequences of such fierce competition upona restricted market, by establishing chartering co-operationbetween the leading British and American oil companies.   after some initial partial success, this plan has broken down,partly owing to the fear of the Americans that their participation wouldinvolve an infringement of their legal code, but mainly because thesupply of free tankers is inadequate to meet the demands of thevarious charterers upon it and the Americans have become frightened.They have therefore resumed competitive chartering.7. There remains only one way to protect the Allied interestsagainst this intense competitive chartering, namely, to control as quickly as possible the free Norv/norwegian tanker tonnage.8. This control is necessary also to protect Allied charterersagainst further large increases in rates of hire.    The rates underthe Shipping Arrangement with Norway are due for revision on the

llth May, and high rates in the neutral markets will put theNorwegian owners in a very strong bargaining position..   An advanceof only 4/-   .a deadweight ton on the tonnage already nominatedwould amount to an extra payment of  4,000,000 per annum..9. Control of the only free tankers would, in large measure,enable us to regulate the oil imports of neutral countries, withoutresort to forced rationing.10. Further, in. the unlikely event of the amount of tanker tonnage in Allied hands being found to be larger than their own needs, our control of this tonnage could be used with great effect in many directions of advantage to the Allies.PROPOSALS FOR OBTAINING THE TANKERS.11. It is considered that it would be impossible at the present stage to charter the remaining fifty Norwegian tankers on acommercial basis either through the normal market channels or as was done under the Norwegian Shipping Arrangement by negotiating with the Norwegian Shipowners Association alone.12. The Shipping Arrangement which is now in operation precludesany attempt to bring pressure to bear on Norwegian shipowners toplace at our disposal further tankers.    I know of no means of bringing pressure to bear upon the Norwegian Government for thepurpose.13. On the other hand there is reason to believe that theNorwegian Government might be ready to regard the chartering offurther Norwegian tankers as a bargaining factor in negotiations to secure concessions from the Allies in the interest of Norwaygenerally.14. The only concessions that I can suggest likely to carrysufficient weight with the Norwegian Government at present to persuade them to procure further tankers for chartering by theAllies are:-1. assistance from the Allies for the Norwegian Armsprogramme, and if possible2. some modification of the arrangements now requiringNorwegian vessels to call at Kirkwall.

15. As regards (l) the most urgent requirement of theNorwegian Government is for anti-aircraft guns and ammunition.They have tried without success to obtain these from Italy andthe United States and failing Germany the Allies are the only possible source.    In the recent War Trade Agreement negotiationsHis Majesty&apos;s Government was asked to agree to additional exportof herrings and fats from Norway to Germany in order to enableNorway to obtain eighty guns and ammunition.    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment agreed to the additional export of herrings againsthalf the guns and ammunition and secured in return ten Norwegiantankers in addition to those nominated under the ShippingArrangement of November 11th.16. As regards (s) the Norwegian Government and the Norwegianshipowners are known to be anxious to avoid having to call atKirkwall in view of German threats to sink vessels callingthere.    I understand that arrangements to avoid such callswithout weakening our Contraband Control present great difficulties but that the matter is under consideration by theMinistry of Economic Warfare and the Contraband control committee.    In my view the importance of obtaining theadditional tankers we seek froKi Norway justifies every possibleconcession as regards Contraband Control, and full weight should be given in this connection to the control whicli the chartering of the tankers will give over neutral imports of oil.17. Norway is also known to require field guns urgently anda small number of aeroplanes.18. The Norwegian Government have also approached theMinistry of Economic Warfare asking for assistance in obtainingin the United States for Norwegians use 100 aeroplane enginesnot later than the 15th September, and suggesting that in return the Norwegian Ministry of Defence would undertake to place orders in the United States for the equivalent number of engines for later delivery to the Allies.

19.- Assistance from the Allies in respect of any of thesearms requirements would I believe make the Norwegians favourable to our requirements regarding tankers.   Most.important of allfrom their point of view are the anti-aircraft guns andammunition owing to the criticism in Norway of the Governmentfor its lack of foresight in leaving Norway unprotected against air raids.    So difficult is their internal political situationin this respect that I believe that they would be willing to concede our tanker requirements if they could claim that theyhad secured the necessary guns . frcra the Allies.    Out of theeighty which they hoped to obtain from the Germans it is reportedthat the latter are only able to supply twenty with a promise of twenty more on dates to be agreed.    I believe that it would be unnecessary to supply guns of the latest design but I have no official view from the Norwegian Government on this point.20. My Department has been informed by the War Office thatthere is no surplus of guns or ammunition and that all there arein hand or in sight are urgently required for use in the fieldor for training and that any question of using our offer of such supplies for bargaining with a. neutra1 is a matter requiringCabinet consideration.    I submit that an exceptional effort tomeet the Norwegian Governments requirements as regards armswould be justified in order to obtain the use of the additionaltankers which provide the only remaining opportunity of ensuringadequate supplies of oil vital to our war effort.    Unless we actnow the available Norwegian tankers will undoubtedly bechartered to the United States or Italy at extravagent rates andthe opportunity of obtaining them will have to be postponedindefinitely.21i I should aim at est^biiRhing a rate of freight for thetankers which woul&apos;&quot; be fixed at least until the end of 1940.

Such rate would have to he moderately above that provided in theShipping Arrangement.    I believe also that it would be in theinterests of the Allies, and assist my negotiations, if I was prepared to agree to revision of the rates under the ShippingArrangement also before they are due on May 11th so as to stabilise the rate for the whole of the Norwegian tankers at a moderate level until at least the end of 1940.Ministry of Shipping.11th March, 1940.
