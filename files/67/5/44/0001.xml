Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1940.SECRET. Copy No. 1w.p. (G.) (40) m.April 3, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.AFGHANISTAN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WITH reference to War Cabinet Conclusion 12 (39) of the 11th September,1939, I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum which has been prepared bythe Secretary of State for India and myself on the subject of our relationstowards Afghanistan in the event of a threat from Russia.H.Foreign Office, April 3, 1940.AFGHANISTAN.AT their meeting on the 11th September, 1939, the War Cabinet approvedour proposals to approach the Afghan Government with the offer of a mutual assistance Agreement on the lines suggested in the Joint Foreign Office andIndia Office Memorandum of the 7th September (W.P. (G.) (39) 4). This offer was duly communicated to the Afghan Government, but was eventually rejected by them in October because of their fear that such an Agreement might havethe effect of provoking Soviet aggression and because His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere not at that stage prepared to commit themselves to come to their supportwith armed forces. Nevertheless, the offer was very cordially received by theAfghan Government and both parties subsequently agreed to base their relationswith one another on a policy of mutual collaboration and assistance on the lines proposed in the draft Pact, despite the absence of any written agreement tothis effect. In pursuance of this policy two officers of the General Staff inIndia paid a visit to Kabul to discuss certain military matters with AfghanMinisters. These conversations did not result in any definite conclusions being reached, and it has become clear that one obstacle to progress in these negotia-tions is the uncertainty as to the extent and nature of the support which weshould give the Afghan Government in the event of Russian aggression, since this uncertainty makes it difficult to discuss with the Afghan Government whatstrategic plan they should themselves adopt.10957   [21062] b
2. In a telegram of the 4th February, 1940, our Minister at Kabul reportedthat the Afghan Prime Minister had definitely requested him to obtain a cleardefinition of His Majesty&apos;s attitude and action in the event of a Soviet attackon Afghanistan. In reporting this request Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler stated thatthe general opinion at Kabul, both among Afghans and foreigners, is that inthe event of such an attack His Majesty&apos;s Government certainly would go tothe assistance of Afghanistan, and that the effect of our failure to do so wouldbe disastrous in Afghanistan and (Sir K. Fraser-Tytler suggested) might seriously prejudice our position with Mahometans in the Middle and Near East,and perhaps in India.3. In the light of the above and taking into account recent developments in Soviet policy, we have thought it necessary to give the whole question furtherconsideration. The Government of India were consulted in a telegram of the14th February which put certain provisional suggestions to them for their views.The whole field of Anglo-Afghan relations was then about to be reviewed bythe Government of India in consultation at Delhi with His Majesty&apos;s Minister.A copy of the India Office telegram is attached herewith,^) together with a copyof the Government of India&apos;s reply of the 12th March.(2)4. We would invite the attention of the War Cabinet to the first fourparagraphs of the Government of India&apos;s telegram. It will be seen that theyare convinced that it is essential to maintain our accepted policy of preserving the independence and integrity of Afghanistan, which has held the field formany years and to which we referred in our previous memorandum of the7th September last (W.P. (G.) (39) 4), and consider that to this end someconfidential assurance should be given to the Afghan Government that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would treat Soviet aggression against Afghanistan as acasus belli. In coming to this conclusion the Government of India are particularlyimpressed by the need for being assured of Moslem support both in India and outside, and they have no doubt that failure to oppose Soviet aggression in afghanistan would lead to a serious deterioration in the Moslem situation inIndia.5. On the other hand the Government of India propose that in informing the Afghan Government of the extent of the military aid which would be rendered to them in a casus belli it should be made clear that in the event of soviet aggression armed assistance by His Majesty&apos;s Government would belimited to offensive air action against Soviet bases and lines of communicationby aircraft operating from bases in India and/or the Middle East,.but wouldnot include the despatch of land or air forces into Afghanistan itself.6. We agree with the Government of India that an assurance of supportagainst Soviet aggression should be given to the Afghan Government (we do not suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government should commit themselves to a declarationof war); but we think that for the following reasons it is out of the question toplace the definite and narrow limitation which they propose on the action whichwe might take to give effect to such an assurance, or to inform the Afghan Govern-merit that our action would be so restricted. To take this line would hardly seemconsistent with the giving of an assurance at all; it would go far to rob it of its value and desired effect, and might even do more harm than good. It will be noticed that the Government of India&apos;s present proposal is more restrictive than what was approved by the Cabinet last September. Even then the possibility of giving some assistance by our land forces was not definitely excluded. Since then thedesirability of doing so has in our view been clearly emphasised by the courseof events. We agree with the views expressed by the Chiefs of Staff in theirreport of the 8th March (C.O.S. (40) 252) as to the importance of assisting theAfghan Government and the provision of some assistance by forces from India.Our Minister at Kabul also considers that in order to maintain the Afghans&apos;moral some stiffening of their resistance would be needed by land.7. We wish to draw the urgent attention of the War Cabinet to the seriousmilitary and political consequences which would ensue if a Russian attack onAfghanistan should materialise and if for any reason His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfailed to give adequate military support to the Afghan Government in resistingit. We would remind our colleagues that it is an accepted principle of british policy, reaffirmed on the last occasion in 1934, that the independence and integrity(&apos;) See Appendix 1.(2) See Appendix 2.
of Afghanistan is essential to the defence of India and of the Empire. If Russiasucceeded in crushing Afghan resistance, the resulting threats to India, and consequent strain on our resources, would be such as greatly to outweigh anyrisks that might have to be incurred in supporting Afghan resistance with our armed forces before it was too late. Apart from long range air action, theremay be little that we could do to hinder the occupation of Afghanistan&apos;s northernProvinces (the eventual fate of which would have to depend on the victoriousconclusion of the war), but it would at any rate be essential to endeavour bytimely action to preserve the independence of the Afghan State south of the hindu Kush.8. Apart from the material interests at stake to which we have alluded, we wish to lay great stress on the grave damage which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould suffer in their credit and prestige if Afghanistan should succumb to a russian attack. The success of Soviet aggression against Finland is, in anycase, bound to have a serious effect on Russia&apos;s smaller neighbours, and we shallsuffer from the distortions of enemy propaganda regarding it. Small neutral-States are being told that the Allies are impotent to give effect to their guaranteesor practical expression to their sympathy. It is possible at present to countersuch allegations by pointing to the geographical factors which made it impossibleto send assistance. But we should be self-refuted if we failed to take adequate and visible steps to give effect to our policy and our promises in the case of a country with which we have a common frontier.9. The case of Afghanistan, moreover, has a special importance because, asa Moslem country, it would be regarded by the Moslem world as a test of our ability to help small nations and to uphold our own clear interests. We have nodoubt that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government showed no visible signs of support otherthan air action from bases outside Afghanistan, the belief in our power (to say nothing of our sincerity) would be dangerously shaken not only among thefrontier tribes and in India, but throughout the Middle East and in every Moslemcountry.10. We have so far said nothing on the question whether, or to what extent,the risk of Russian aggression may be increased by the termination of the warin Finland. Our main point is that, whatever this risk may be, the issues at stake are so important that it is essential that we should take adequate steps tomeet an attack on Afghanistan if it should occur. We would suggest, however,that it is quite arguable that, supposing Russia should be inclined to adventuresin Asia, Afghanistan is the point at which she might reckon on being able to combine the maximum damage to British interests with the minimum danger toherself. Presumably it may be of interest to Russia not to disturb the neutrality of Turkey or Iran, since to do so would expose her to attack where she is most vulnerable. She has no similar interest in refraining from the initiative in afghanistan.11. For the reasons stated in paragraphs 6-9 above we suggest that it mustbe the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the event of Russian aggressionto give effective support to the Afghan Government by all the means in their power, and that this must include some immediate measure of military co-opera-tion by land forces in Afghanistan itself, and may not improbably require theprovision of a considerable force for operations in southern Afghanistan. Wefurther suggest that the following steps should be taken to give effect to thispolicy : His Majesty&apos;s Government should certainly at once assure the AfghanGovernment that a clear case of Russian aggression would be regarded by HisMajesty&apos;s Government as a casus belli; and, so far from hedging this assurancein the restrictive manner suggested by the Government of India, the british minister should at once be authorised to assure the Afghan Government, if he isquestioned on the point, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared togive all the assistance in their power, including the immediate provision of some measure of assistance by land forces from India, in addition to air support(though they could not undertake an obligation for the military defence of thenorthern frontier of Afghanistan).12.   As regards the measures to be taken to implement this assurance, wehave two proposals to make : Firstly, we suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government[21062] b 2
should decide immediately on the minimum steps which should, in any case, betaken, in the event of Russian aggression, in order to strengthen Afghan moral and as an earnest of our intentions. These immediate measures might perhapsconsist of the despatch of a strong military mission to Kabul, together with a nucleus of technical troops. The Government of India should be requested to beprepared to undertake some minimum assistance of this character, and shouldbe asked to put forward at once their suggestions as to the form which itshould take.13. Our second proposal relates to the more difficult question of the furtherland forces which would probably be required and for providing which plans and preparations would have to be put in hand forthwith. Operations in Afghanistando not at present form part of strategic plans for the employment of the Army inIndia and the strength and dispositions of the latter have not been determined with any such liability in view. The military authorities in India would naturally be most reluctant to take the risks that would be involved in diverting large forces in India from their allotted roles, even though it might in the event befound that the problems of India &apos;s internal security and frontier defence mightbe eased proportionately to the extent to which we are able to render effectivehelp to Afghanistan. If, therefore, the Cabinet accept our main suggestion asto the policy to be adopted, and in particular our view as to the gravity of thedanger to our prestige in the Moslem world (especially in the light of the most recent events) which would result from any failure to give effective support, tothe Afghan Government, we suggest that the Chiefs of Staff should be asked to reconsider this specific problem as urgently as possible in the light of these factors and to report on the best means of providing such forces as might probably berequired for effective co-operation with the Afghans in the defence of southernAfghanistan, or for the replacement of such forces as were made available from india for this purpose.14. We have one further suggestion to make. As one possible measure ofassistance to the Afghan Government it will be a matter for consideration withthe Government of India whether we could not usefully recruit considerable numbers of our tribesmen as levies to fight in the cause of their Afghanco-religionists against the Soviet Union. This would possess the double advantageof giving welcome employment to the young men of these tribes and of adding a body of admirable natural fighting material to the Anglo-Afghan forces.15. It will be seen from the Government of India&apos;s telegram that theyconsider that some form of open declaration of the British attitude might be useful, as tending to deter Russia from aggressive action. We agree with thisview and recommend that, besides giving a confidential assurance to the AfghanGovernment that Soviet aggression would be regarded as a casus belli, we shouldrenew our offer of an open agreement for mutual assistance on the lines approvedby the Cabinet last September. The conclusion of an overt agreement mustnaturally depend, however, on the attitude of the Afghan Government, who onaccount of nervousness of Russia might be unwilling that anything should bepublished. On the other hand, we should hope that the grant of the confidentialassurance would make the Afghan Government the more willing to accept theGovernment of India&apos;s advice in the organisation of their defence forces and theirstrategic plans.16. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Government of India&apos;s telegram of the12th March relate to certain requests received from the Afghan Government forthe grant of credits for the purchase of commercial goods and military equipment,which are being dealt with separately.Summary of Proposals.17.   The proposals which we submit are :  (1) That it should be accepted as an essential part of the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government that in the event of Russian aggression againstAfghanistan, support must be given to the Afghan Government by allthe means in our power.
(2) That a secret assurance should now be given to the Afghan Governmentthat a case of clear aggression by Soviet forces directed against theindependence or integrity of Afghanistan would be regarded by HisMajesty&apos;s Government as a casus belli.(3) That the Afghan Government should also at once be assured that in a clear case of Russian aggression His Majesty&apos;s Government would beprepared to give them all the assistance in their power, including theimmediate provision of some measure of assistance by land forces from india, in addition to air support (though they could not undertake an obligation for the military defence of the northern frontier of afghanistan).(4) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should decide immediately as to theminimum measures which should, in any case, be taken in the event ofRussian aggression in order to strengthen Afghan moral, and as an earnest of their intentions; and that the Government of India shouldbe requested to prepare to undertake such minimum measures andshould be consulted as to the form which they should take.(5) That the Chiefs of Staff should be asked to reconsider urgently theproblem of British support for Afghanistan on the basis of the policy proposed in (1) above, and to report on the best means of providingsuch forces as might probably be required for effective co-operation in the defence of southern Afghanistan or for the replacement of such forces as were made available from India for this purpose.(6) That the Government of India should be consulted on the question of raising levies of our tribesmen for service in Afghanistan if required.(7) That the offer of an open agreement of mutual assistance on the lines approved by the Cabinet in September 1939 should again be made tothe Afghan Government.Aprils, 1940.
Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Government of India, dated february 14, 1940.Important.756.   Addressed to Government of India.   Repeated to Kabul, No. 33.Forminkas 23 and 24 of 4th February : Afghan-Soviet relations and military assistance for Afghan Government.We are anxious that definite decisions should be reached as soon as possiblein order to avoid any possibility of Afghan accusation of undue delay in replying to their proposals. We should therefore be grateful for Government of India&apos;views at an early date after consultation with Fraser-Tytler in India.2. On receipt of your views it will be necessary to consider referring again to War Cabinet whole question of assistance for Afghanistan against Sovietaggression in light of recent developments. Meanwhile our preliminary view,with which Foreign Office would probably concur, is that in order to smooth courseof negotiations with Afghan Government in military matters and assist instiffening Afghan determination to resist possible Soviet aggression, there ismuch to be said for giving Afghan Government now some more definite guarantee in event of attack by Russia. This might perhaps be given in form of confidentialassurances that His Majesty&apos;s Government would regard Soviet attack onAfghanistan as casus belli. It would, of course, have to be made clear to AfghanGovernment that we must be free to determine how best we could assist in herdefence, but that in any event we could not undertake an obligation for themilitary defence of their northern frontier. Foreign Office are inclined to feelthat there might still be advantage from Afghan point of view vis-a-vis russian an open agreement of mutual assistance with Afghan Government, but thiswould naturally depend on attitude of Afghan Government.3. If it were possible to give Afghan Government some confidential state -ment as to our attitude in event of a Soviet attack, this would provide a basis onwhich it would be easier to advise them frankly on their military plans, and onconsequential questions of training and equipment.4. As regards supply of arms and equipment, list of requirements submittedby Afghan War Minister to Molesworth seems excessive and we have not thoughtit worth while to give matter any detailed examination pending receipt of your views. Fraser-Tytler seems to have dealt with this question very successfully in discussion with Prime Minister. It is possible that we might succeed in obtaininglarger credit than sum mentioned in paragraph 4 of Forminka 96, but there will still remain difficulty of His Majesty&apos;s Government supplying arms, &amp;c, inpresent circumstances. In any case we imagine you would agree that grant of credit for armaments should be considered as part of whole scheme of military assistance and should be made dependent on Afghan acceptance of advice inreorganisation and training of Afghan army.APPENDIX 2.Telegram from the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India,dated March 12, 1940.Important.769. Addressed to Secretary of State for India. Repeated to Kabul,No. 95.Your telegram No. 756, 14th February.We have considered the whole field of policy in Afghanistan during the war,as it appears to us, in conference with Fraser-Tytler. We are convinced thatit is essential to maintain the policy which has held the field for many years,that of maintenance of the integrity of Afghanistan, and to do everything possibleto keep Russia from nearer approach to India.   We are agreed that to this
end some assurance should be given that His Majesty&apos;s Government would meet Soviet aggression on Afghanistan by declaration of war. In coming tothis conclusion we are particularly impressed by the need for being assured ofMoslem support both in India and outside, and we have no doubt failure tomeet Russian aggression in Afghanistan would lead to serious deterioration of the Moslem situation in India. The Punjab and Bengal, where the constitution is being worked, are particularly in point, while the effect of inaction on theNorth-West Frontier tribes would be incalculable. We agree also generally with the statement of the position contained in paragraph 5 of Kabul telegramNo. 23.2. It is necessary to determine what would constitute aggression. this might take the form of : (a) Attempt by Amanullah or one of his party to stage coup d&apos;Etat with financial support of the Soviet, but without military support.(b) Political pressure by Soviet to obtain foothold in Afghanistan ostensiblyfor commercial purposes.(c) Establishment  of  a  puppet  Government  in  Northern  Afghanistansupported by Soviet forces.(d) Direct invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet.In the case of (a) or (&amp;), warning by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Sovietthat we would. assist the Afghans to maintain their integrity might suffice(c) or (d) we consider should be a casus belli.3. Form of secret assurance offered to Afghans in respect to military aid inthe event of a casus belli should, in our judgment, make the following pointsclear : (a) that we regard the actual defence of Afghan territory to be primarilythe (? responsibility) of Afghan Defence Forces; and (b) that, in the event of soviet aggression, armed assistance by His Majesty&apos;s Government will be limitedto offensive air action against Soviet bases and lines of communication by aircraft operating from bases in India and/or Middle East, but will not include despatchof land or air forces into Afghanistan itself.4. We agree there is much to be said in favour of open declaration ofBritish attitude in order to deter aggression, and suggest object would be bestserved by conclusion of open pact with the Afghan Government on the lines ofthat enclosed in Foreign Office letter of 1st January, 1940, combined withsecret assurance to the Afghan Government that Soviet aggression will be met by declaration of war, the exact circumstances in which declaration would bemade being explained somewhat on the lines of the four possibilities suggestedin paragraph No. 2 above. Secret assurance would have to make clear that armedassistance in the event of Soviet aggression would be limited by considerationsmentioned in paragraph No. 3. Fraser-Tytler&apos;s tentative view is that there shouldbe hope of persuading the Afghans to enter into open pact if secret assurance,combined with other measures of assistance, can be made sufficiently definite.5. Military Assistance. We agree that military assistance should be givenin the form of provision of armaments and training of Afghan Army and AirForce, but only provided Afghans are willing to accept our advice in the organisa-tion of their defence forces and their strategical plans.6. Credits. Apart from difficulties in supplying armaments from UnitedKingdom or India, and necessity of meeting our own requirements first, we feelthat arms and equipment should be limited to quantity and types necessary fortraining on our advice. For these reasons military assistance can only be given on small scale to begin with, and we advise that difference should be made upby grant of credits for commercial assistance see Katodon telegram No. 16 ofthe 1st February. Plan would then be to offer credits over five-year period on increasing scale for armaments and decreasing scale for commercial purposes. in considering this matter we were influenced by information that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have just granted credits for  5 million sterling to Iran without distinction as between armaments and commercial credits. Scale of credits wouldrequire careful consideration, not without reference to those granted to Persia.We would suggest total amount for armaments and commercial purposes for period of five years should not exceed  2-1 million sterling, unless examination
of Afghans&apos; capacity to spend and repay justified larger sum (they have actuallyasked for  12-^ million sterling commercial, and some  5 million sterling militarycredits). Fraser-Tytler thinks that, in return for credits Afghans would agreeto make purchases in India and United Kingdom and to divert their produce toand through same countries.7. Incidence. To meet subsidies and other expenditure classed as&quot; political,&quot; as opposed to &quot; defence,&quot; expenditure, we are prepared to increase our annual contribution to Afghan fund to Rs. 25 lakhs per annum during thewar. But in context of these discussions credits for armaments and commercialexpansion must be regarded as expenditure on external defence of India, andtherefore, subject to qualification below, to be met by His Majesty&apos;s government under the recent defence financial settlement. Exception might be that commer-cial credits would be underwritten by India to the extent that they were spent in India. Credits for armaments outside the capacity of enlarged Afghan fund would be liability of His Majesty&apos;s Government.8. On hearing your views we will prepare draft suggested secret assurance.Fraser-Tytler is in general agreement with these conclusions subject to twoprovisos :- (a) He emphasises the importance of grant of assistance to Afghanistan onscale approximately equal to that given to Iran.(b) He thinks that in order to maintain Afghan morale some stiffening ofAfghan resistance by land will be needed at an early stage.As regards latter point, our views are definitely stated in paragraph No. above.
