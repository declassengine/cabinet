ACQUISITION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND by service DEPARTMENTS a  INCLUDING THEMINISTRY ^P supply memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries        :&apos;1. In accordance with arrangements made at a meeting of .representatives of the departments concerned, held under the :Chairmanship of Sir Horace Wilson on the 21st January, 1938, aliaison procedure was established whereby consultation takes place with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries before the service departments actually acquire agricultural land.     The principles on which this liaison procedure is based were defined in a letter which the Prime Minister addressed to Lord Herbert on the25th January, 1938, and published on the 2nd February, 1938.     In;that letter it was laid down that, while the needs of the service departments were bound to receive priority, it was the desire ofthe Government to carry out each part of the defence programme inthe way best calculated to cause the minimum of disturbance toother interests.     With this end in view, the letter stated, a procedure had been established by each Defence Department whichwould ensure that other interests of national importance shouldreceive adequate consideration when the selection and development of sites were being carried out, and that that consideration shouldtake place in time to enable due weight to be given to the resultsby the Defence Department concerned before decisions as toacquisition were taken*SECRET* jj^P- (40)  90.MARCH  29th,  1940 COPY NO.WAR CABINET

7 ri 1fa t? X2. It will be not eel that the procedure was laid downunder peace time conditions but it has been continued onsubstantially the sane lines since the outbreak of war, withthe addition of the Ministry of Supply to the ordinary service departments.      Since the formal consultative procedure was established, the Ministry of Agriculture&apos;s records reveal that over 100,000 acres of agricultural land have been dealt withand have been lost to agriculture as a result of acquisitionor requisition by Service Departments.     This area does not include land acquired by the War Office for training purposes,amounting in the aggregate to an area of not less than100,000 acres over which ordinary farming operations have beencurtailed to a greater or less extent.3. Before dealing with the new position which has been created as a result of the country being at war, it isnecessary to emphasise that the existing liaison procedureimplies absolute priority for Service as opposed to agricultural and other needs, not only in the formulation by theDepartment concerned of its programme of expansion, but also inthe determination of the particular sites to be selected tocomplete that programme.     Accordingly the Ministry ofAgriculture is not normally consulted before a definite sitehas been provisionally selected for a particular purpose and isabout to be acquired.     Whatever the agriculturalconsiderations involved the Ministry of Agriculture has no powerto veto acquisition, and even when land of considerableagricultural value is concerned, the only course open to it isto request that an endeavour be made to secure another site and,if possible, to suggest alternative areas for consideration.The effect of representations made at this stage is limited.4. It will be realised that normally the Ministry ofAgriculture&apos;s representations have little effect as whateveralternative sites are suggested, the Service Department concernedmay maintain that the considerations which have governed the2.

selection of the particular site render any alternative siteunsuitable.      In this connection, it is of interest to indicate the requirements of certain of the Service Departments in selecting sites.      The Air Ministry require .for their aerodromes and landing grounds considerable areas of level and well-drainedland, with a soil capable of maintaining a good grass surface,and the sites have to be found within a restricted radius., e.g.as a result of the necessity for satellite aerodromes within acertain distance of the parent aerodrome.      The Ministry of Supplyagain, have sought tracts of level land varying in extent from600 acres upwards and at some distance from centres of population,for factories of various types, while the War Office need level,well-drained sites for hutted camps in close proximity to thetraining areas, which, in their turn, must usually be convenientlysituated for the ports of embarkation.     As the requirements ofthe Service Departments are identical in some respects with theattributes of excellent agricultural land, it follows that agreat deal of land far above the average of the agricultural land of England and Wales from the point of view of foodproduction has been withdrawn from agriculture.     While it is recognised that in the case of land required for such purposes asoperational aerodromes, it may be essential in the interests ofnational defence that the requirements of the Defence departments should be completely satisfied both as regards extent and siting,it appears that a valid distinction can be drawn between these requirements and the acquisition of land by the defence departments for such purposes as depots, stores, training areas and aerodromes, factories, barracks, etc.      In the latter case itis considered that other considerations of vital national importance, such as food production, should be taken into accountboth in the determination of the extent of the programme of landacquisition and of the choice of the actual sites.     Thisdistinction has, in fact, been to some extent recognised by theAir Ministry under an arrangement made in July, 1939, whereby it

was agreed that every effort should he made to follow the general principles underlying this distinction and that cases of particuladifficulty which might arise should he referred to Ministers fortheir personal consideration.5. Suggestions have teen put forward from time to time asto the possibility of the Service Departments notifying theMinistry of Agriculture in advance of their anticipated require-ments in regard to sites, with a view of suggestions being madeas to the land to be acquired,  in order to minimise interferencewith agriculture and food production.    This, however, has notbeen found practicable.6, It will be appreciated that, whatever may have beenthe position in peace time, the initiation of the Government&apos;campaing for increasing home food production in time of war has created an entirely new position, not only from the point ofview of agricultural production but also as regards the attitudeof the general public and the agricultural community to a stateof affairs which results in good agricultural land being diverted to other uses, however important for the successful prosecution of the war.    In fact, matters have now come to such a pass that,in the case of practically every acquisition of good agricultural land by the Service Departments, representationspour in from Members of Parliament, local authorities and private individuals, with all the resulting undercurrent of criticism of the Governments administration^7. Enough has been said to indicate that, from the pointof view of agriculture and food production, the existing liaisonprocedure is not effective and,  in view of the importance attached by the Government to the food production campaign, itseems necessary to consider whether the present policy of granting absolute priority to Service Departments in their requirements as regards land Is the right one in the circumstances,,8. There are two aspects of this matter.    The first isthe actual determination by the Service Departments of the

programme of land acquisition which in their view is necessary for defence purposes.      The second relates to the choice of theactual sites of land to he acquired for the fulfilment of this programme.9. As regards the first,  it would appear that theService &quot;Departments could claim, with some justification, thatthey alone are in a position to judge the minimum requirementsneeded to fulfil their defence responsibilities.      Nevertheless,even here it Is arguable that other consider at ions of national importance should perhaps be taken into account in the determination of the Service Departments&apos; programme of landacquisition and that the final decision should rest, not withthe Service Departments themselves, but with some independent body.     To illustrate the importance of this question, theMinistry of Agriculture has just received from the Air Ministryan intimation that between now and the autumn,  they must acquireor earmark sites for about 100 aerodromes comprising a totalarea of 40,000 to 60,000 acres, and it is understood that theseare for the most part required for training purposes.     no information is available as to all the circumstances leading tothis decision, but it is conceivable that,  after other considerations of national importance had been taken intoaccount and the matter had been considered by an independent body,  it would have been decided that in preference to taking such a large area of land from food production purposes in thiscountry, it would have been preferable to extend air training facilities in, for instance, Canada.10. Even if, however, it is considered that it is essential in the national interest to give absolute priority to theService Departments as regards the determination of the programmeof land acquisition, there still remains the second aspect ofthis matter, namely, the choice of the actual sites of land tobe acquired, on which the Service Departments also have the

last word, not only as regards land required for vital defence purposes such as operational aerodromes, hut also as regardsland required for other and less important defence purposes.The distinction between land required for these differentpurposes has already been referred to in Paragraph 4 above.While, in accordance with the present liaison arrangements the Service Departments do endeavour, in response torepresentations, to find alternative sites comprising land of lower agricultural value but which would comply with theirstrategic and operational requirements, nevertheless,it may be argued that there must be cases where it wouldbe in the national interest for the Service Departments tobe content with land which is not ideal from their point ofview if this would have the result of preserving good agricultural land for food production purposes.     In many of these cases the location of a site in a particular place is desired by theService Departments merely for reasons of  administrative convenience or for obtaining the maximum amount of efficiency,but these considerations must be weighed against other aspects ofnational defence? such as food production, and not treated as ifthey must necessarily be given precedence.     For example, it maynot be so conducive to military efficiency or training to locatetraining areas at a distance from Command Headquarters, but ifgood agricultural land can be saved by the choice of some alternative site even though it may result in some diminution inthe convenience or efficiency of army training, it is forconsideration whether such action should not be taken.     Moreover,other considerations of importance from the point of view of foodproduction may have to be taken, into account as, for instance,the difficulties which may arise through the drawing away oflabour from agricultural work.  .  In time of war, when the utmostis being done by the Ministry of Agriculture to increase foodproduction and to bring back into cultivation as much land aspossible, it seems undesirable-that there should be no adequate6.

external check on the Service Departments in the siting  of their requirements.      It is here that some site finding machinery wouldhe valuable, particularly if it were put into operation at. a very early stage, i.e. directly the approximate extent of the service departments requirements is determined.     At present theMinistry of Agriculture is not brought into the picture until an actual site has been selected by the Land Officers of the service departments, often after months of investigation, and it is onlynatural in these circumstances that urgency should then be pleadedand a reluctance evinced to spend further time in searching forand surveying alternative sites.11. It is therefore suggested:-(i) that consideration should be given to the establishmentof a &quot;Priority Board&quot; to deal with the programme ofland requirements of the Service Departments in so far asagricultural land is likely to be affected,  and that theBoard should exercise surveillance over the service departments&apos; programmes in the siting of their requirements;(ii) that Service Departments should notify a draftprogramme insofar as agricultural land is likely to beaffected to the &quot;Priority Board&quot; and to the agricultural departments at a very early date;(iii) that the &quot;Priority Board&quot;, if established, should havepower in any particular case to direct that the Service.   Department requiring a site in a particular districtshould be content with land which is not ideal for their purpose,  if the alternative would be the diversion ofgood agricultural land from food production.12. For convenience of presentation,  this Memorandum hasbeen prepared by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries but the Secretary of State for Scotland desires to associate himself

entirely with it.     The position in Scotland is no better thanin England and Wales and it has been the subject of greatcomplaint by the Agricultural Executive Committees.     Thebest agricultural land is situated near the sea which makes itparticularly suitable for aerodromes..      In certain districtssuch as Orkney and Moray Firth Area the effect on theagricultural labour supply has been particularly serious.(Intld.)      R.H.D-S.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Ir
