LOSS OP IMPORTING CAPACITY INSEPARABLEPROM THE CONVEY SYSTEM.r, INTRODUCTORY.In my survey of the extent to which shippingconsiderations call for a review of our import programme(Paper W.P.(40)64), I refer to the loss of shipping capacityconsequent upon,  or incidential to,  the need for conveyingmerchant ships in time of war, on which I now submit thefollowing reporto2. A large part of the loss of shipping capacity in timeof war is due to the need for adopting measures for theprotection of merchant shipping from attack by U-boats.The delays so incurred include time lost while waiting for convoy7  deviations from normal routes, aig-zaggingand similar causes.      In all these matters,  close and continuous cantact is maintained between the Ministry ofShipping and the Admiralty;  and no effort is spared toensure that;  subject to the coservance of the necessarysafeguards,  the delays to shipping should be as small aspossible*      The causes    leading to delay are of a complexcharacter and their full  significance is not alwaysadequately appreciated.      I propose therefore,  in the lightof information furnished to me by the Naval Staff, toenumerate the elements which go to make up this problem;    to describe certain measures recently taken to re-inforce the convoy system and others which are in contemplation;    and finally to give an estimate of the loss of importing capacity inevitably resulting from the convoy system.

II.    ESTIMATE OF TH:: UNAVOIDABLE DELAYS to shipping DUE TO THE NEED FOR CONVOY.3.       The carrying capacity of a ship is assessed on the round voyage from her loading port in the United Kingdomand hack again.      Ships having a speed of fifteen knotsand over are classed as &quot;fast liners&quot; and sail independentlyrelying for protection on their speed and gun armament.Ships having a speed of under 15 knots proceed in convoyfor part both of the outward and homeward voyage.      Theobject of the convoy is to escort such ships with anti-submarine vessels through the areas in which they may be exposed to U-boat attack namely, the waters round andin the approaches to the British Isles.     The onlyexceptions to the above rule are the East Coast Convoy,which was instituted mainly for protection against air attack, and the Scandinavian Convoy which was institutedto afford protection against all forms of attack.Shipping outward bound into the Atlantic is convoyed out to the Western Approaches and then, if bound for North or south America, West Africa, or the Cape, it is dispersedand continues its voyage independently.      If bound forGibraltar or into or through the Mediter. anean, shipping is escorted as far as Gibraltar, since the whole voyagebetween the United Kingdom and Gibraltar is considered as &quot;being potentially dangerous, from the point of view of u-boat attack.      In order to ensure that inward-boundshipping is already in convoy by the time that it reachesthe dangerous areas in the approaches to this country,it is essential that convoys should be formed overseassince it is not considered practicable to form them at sea.

4. The round voyage of any given ship can hedivided into the following phases:-(a) outward in convoy to the western approaches;(h) outward voyage from the Y/e sternApproaches to the discharging port;(c) time spent discharging and reloading;(d) voyage from reloading port to convoyassembly port;(e) awaiting convoy at assembly port,&apos;(f) homeward voyage in convoy from assemblyport to the Western Approaches;(g) in convoy from the Western Approaches tothe discharging port.5. The naval staff estimate that in the case of a ship which is convoyed both ways the average delays socaused cannot be reduced in the case of the Mediterraneanroute to less than 12 days or in the case of other routes to less than between 12 and 13 days.      I attach as an appendix (Appendix A;  an extract from a very interesting detailed estimate of these delays and theircauses prepared in the Trade Division of the admiralty and furnished to me in the course of my inquiry.6. In order to ascertain to what extent; if anysthe delays on the Mediterranean and Transatlantic roundtrips in practice exceed the Admiralty&apos;s estimate(given above) of the delays inevitable on account of convoys, I invited the Minister of Shipping to prepare?in.consultation with representatives of the ship Jwners,an analysis of the time actually spent by particularships an specific round voyages on these routes.An examination was accordingly made &apos; of nine-3-

Transatlantic and eleven Mediterranean round voyageseThe actual number of days spent on these twentyvoyages was 1319;    and the owners estimated that under normal conditions the same voyages v/ould have occupied993 dayso     The difference, due to war conditions, is thus 326 days, made up as follows:-Waiting for convoy 132 daysSteaming delays due toreduced speed in convoy,routeing and deviationto convoy assembly place. 126^ daysDelays in port 67^ daysTotal 326   daysMore detailed figures relating to these voyages furnished to me by the Minister of Shipping are given in Appendix B.7. For the purpose of estimating the delays due toconvoy it is necessary to deduct from the total the daysspent in port, since such delays, though due to war causes,are unconnected with Admiralty control0     When thisdeduction has been made, it will be seen that in thespecimen cases investigated the actual delays for reasons connected with convoy amounted, in the case of theMediterranean route to 15.7 days, and in the case of theTransatlantic route to 12 days.      It will be seen,therefore, that in the voyages which were investigatedthe delays actually incurred as the result of convoywere very little, if at all, greater than the periodestimated by the Admiralty as inevitable if there isto be a convoy system at all.

2bIII.    Recent and contemplated reinforcement of the convoy system.8., The organisation of the convoy system hascalled for great efforts on the part of the admiralty,and the introduction of more frequent convoys toensure the arrival of one convoy daily, are only possible as and v/hen larger numbers of escorting craftare available09. Arrangements have been made within the last few weeks to increase the number of destroyers availablefor the Bergen convoy to an extent sufficient topermit of the introduction of a four-day, in place of an eight-day, cycle, thus reducing the average delay onthis route through the need for waiting for covoy by two days on each trip, i.e0 by four days on the roundvoyage.     As regards the Transatlantic convoys, it ishoped that it will be possible later to make arrange-ments by which one convoy on these routes will arrivedaily.10. Consideration is also being given to thepossibility of introducing a direct convoy from the west indies from some point such as Trinidado    In this connexion, I should however, observe that the delaycaused to ships loading in the West Indies proceeding to Halifax to join the cofxwy are not as great as isoommonly supposed7 and indeed that little or not,diversion is incurred by ships loading in ports at thewestern side of the Gulf of Mexico by reason of being required to proceed to Halifax instead of sailingdirect to this country.     Moreover, once the sugar

crop has been moved, the number of ships involved isnot very  large, the ships in question being either tankersor ships bringing timber from the Canadian west coastby way of the Panama Canal,.11. The East Coast Convoy stands in a special position owing to the need for taking all possible stepsto afford protection against air attack.     As the WarCabinet are awareP the arrangements for this convoy haverecently been modified by the Admiralty in order to afford to the Air Staff the greatest possible measure ofassistance by reducing to some extent the area inrespect of which the air protection must be afforded.This arrangement contemplates the prohibition so far asis possible of independent sailings; except for the verysmall and slow vessels of under about 500 tons and themaintenance of a system of daily convoys between theForth and the Thameso      Pending the full introduction ofthe scheme, independent sailings by night only have been permitted, except within an area extending for a distance of about 120 miles along the Yorkshire coast, and ships now in convoy have been instructed to sail in groups soas to reduce the area in which targets for air attackmay be found.     When the scheme is completely inoperation it is hoped to provide escort for these groups and to confine all movements during the daylight to thearea mentioned aboves and two small areas in the approaches to the For-K\   and Thames EstuariesoIV. Estimate . off,jbh,e loss of effectivecargo-carrying capacity resuitingfrom&apos; the&quot;, need&quot; for cjpnyoy.12. The need for the convoying of merchant vesselsreduces in two ways our capacity in time of war to import goods to this country.     In the first place,

there is the direct loss resulting from the necessaryincrease in the length of the period required by ships under convoy to complete each round trip.    Inthe second place there is the indirect loss caused bythe increased difficulties in discharging cargoes inour ports resulting from the simultaneous arrivalfrom time to time of large numbers of vessels inthe ports concerned.(a) Loss of importing capacitydirectly attributable to the convoy system.13. As regards the direct loss of importing capacity resulting from the convoy system, the analysis given in the preceding paragraphs shows howinevitable it is that the need in war-time forconvoys - however carefully they may be organised and operated - imposes a considerable delay in the movements of merchant shipping.     The effectivecarrying capacity of a ship in any given perioddepends on a number of factors, of which one is thenumber of days on which it is-effectively employed inthat periods     Thus jf in one set of conditions a given weight of cargo could be transported a givendistance by the use of (say) 50,000 tons of shipping in a period of 40 days, and, if conditions were thenso to change that, while the other factors remainedconstant, double the time was required to secure thisvolume of imports by the use of the same amount ofshipping, the effect, in so far as concerns the amountof importing capacity available, would be the sameas if half the ships in question had been sunk andthe rest had carried out the voyage in the normaltime.

14. Great as have been the efforts by the admiralty and all concerned to reduce delays on account of convoyto a minimum, the delays which have been found to be inevitable represent a substantial loss of effectiveimporting capacity as compared with that which wouldbe at our disposal if the time spent by merchant shipson any given round voyage could be reduced to that required for such a voyage in time of peace.    TheMinister of Shipping in his Memorandum of the 19thDecember last (Paper W.P.(G)(39) 155) estimated thatat that time the delays inevitably resulting from the convoy system and precautionary measures affectingnavigation had reduced our importing capacity by over30 per cent, and must at best involve a reduction of between 20 and 25 per cent,(b)    Loss of importing capacity indirectlyattributable to the convoy system.15. It is inevitable under the convoy system that large numbers of vessels should arrive simultaneouslyat the loading and discharging portso    This &quot;bunching&quot;of vessels cannot fail to lead to dislocation in thenormal operation of the ports, through the delay towhich it gives rise in the loading and discharge of cargoes.    The speed with which cargoes can be unloadedis one of the factors governing the net importing capacity of a vessel in any given period;    and it follows i therefore that the &quot;bunching&quot;of vessels at the dis-charging ports leads to a loss in an importing capacity,which is indirectly attributable to the convoy system.More frequent convoys, in so far as these may prove tobe practicable, would reduce the time lost through&quot;bunching&quot;.

V.   Summary of Conclusions,16.       I summarise my conclusions as follows:-(a) The Naval Staff estimate that in the caseof a ship which is convoyed both ways theaverage delays so caused cannot bereduced:-(i)    in the case of the Mediterraneanroute,  to less than 12 days; and(ii)    in the case of other routes, to less than between 12 and 13days;  (paragraphs 3 and 4 and appendix A),(b) At my request the Minister of Shipping inconjunction with representatives of the shipowners has made a detailed examinationof the time actually spent on a number oftypical voyages on the Mediterranean andTransatlantic routes;    this examinationdisclosed that the average delays due toconvoy on the particular voyages examinedamounted to 15 0 7 days in the case of theMediterranean route and 12 days on theTransatlantic route;(paragraphs 6 and 7 and Appendix B).(c) It will be seen from the foregoing thatthere is very close agreement between theestimate made by the Naval staff of the delays inseparable from the convoy system on the one hand and the actual delaysexperienced on the specimen voyages examined;(paragraph 7).(d) Various measures have recently been taken,or are in contemplation to re-inforce the convoy system;    thus a four-day cycle hasbeen introduced for the Bergen convoy in place of the previous eight-day cycle, witha consequent reduction by four  days for the round trip in the delays due to convoy onthis route;    consideration is also being given to the possibility of introducing a direct convoy from the West Indies from some port such as Trinidad;    and special measures have been introduced to improve the East Coast convoy, which stands ina special position owing to the need to afford protection against air attack(paragraph 11).(e) The need for the convoying of merchantvessels reduces in two ways our capacity in time of war to import goods to thiscountry, namely:-(i)    there is the direct loss resultingfrom the necessary increase inthe length of the period requiredby ships under convoy to completeeach round trip;

(ii)    there is the indirect loss fromthe dislocation of thecommercial operation both ofthe loading and dischargingports, resulting from the congestion created by the simultaneous arrival of largenumbers of ships in such ports(paragraphs 13 and 15) .(f)    The Minister of Shipping estimated last december that at that time the delaysinevitably resulting from the convoy system and precautionary measures affecting navigation had reduced ourimporting capacity by over 30 per cent,and must at best involve a reductionof between &quot;:0 and 25 per cent,(paragraph 14).(Initialled)    S.H.Tr ea sury Chamberlain ers, S.

APPENDIX A.ESTIMATE JDF THE UNAVOIDABLE DELAYS to shipping DUE TO THE NEED FOR COWOY.(Extract from a Minute prepared in theTrade Division of the Admiralty),The round voyage can he divided into a number of phaseswhich will be considered briefly below, an estimate being given for the delay experienced during each phase.(a) Outward in convoy no. the -Yester-n Approaches.Three outward convoys, which include ships for alldestinations other than, the Mediterranean, sail from thiscountry every eight days.- and two every eight days containships for or through the Mediterranean..     For the former ships,the average delay at the Convoy assembly Ports - Liverpool andSouthend (or any other ports from which ships join these convoys) is 1-g- days approximately0     For Mediterranean ships the average delay is four days..During the voyage, in convoy, delay is due to:-(i) All ships having to proceed at the speed of the slowest-,      The amount.of this variesaccording to the speed of any particularship, but will not exceed about one day fora its. knot ship and less in proportion forslower ships down to 8 knots.(ii) zig -zaggingj which is difficult to estimate,but will not exceed two or three hours,(b) Outward, voyage from the V/estern approaches to discharging port,A slight delay will be experienced during this phasedue to evasive routeing and aig-zagging.     This is difficult toestimate and will vary with the route0      It should, however,not amount to more than one to two daysB(Note,    In the case of the Gibraltar route,  ships are convoyed the whole way and the delay^i s a&apos;b out 1 day. )

(c) Discharging and re-loadingpNo delay is caused by Admiralty control during thisphase.(d) Prom loading port to Convoy Assembly Port.Ships are routed independently from their loading ports to the appropriate Convoy Assembly Port - Halifax, Freetown(S. Leone) or Gibraltar.     During this phase,  ships proceed at their normal speed and the only delay is caused by evasiverouteing.     Again, this varies with the route, but will normally be covered by one day in the South Atlantic, and lessin the North Atlantic or mediterranean.(e) Awaiting Convoy at Assembly PortoOne fast and one slow convoy leaves each of the AssemblyPorts every 8 days.     The average delay at the assembly Portsfor any individual ship is, therefore, four days.(f) Homeward voyage in convoy from assemblyPort to Western AnoroachesoDuring the homeward voyage in convoy delay is causedby:-(i) All ships having to proceed at the speed ofthe slowest.      This varies with the speed ofany particular ship and the length of the voyage.     For a Ih knot ship this may amountto about 2% days on the Halifax route, 3 dayson the Sierra Leone route, 1 day on the gibraltar route and less in proportion forslov/er ships down to 8 knots.(ii) Evasive routeing0(iii) zig -zaggingo(iv) An allowance of time in hand to meet thecontingencj?- of bad weather, and to ensurearrival at the rendez-vous in the western approaches in accordance with the programme.This is necessary owing to the fact that thenumber of escort vessels is limited,  and alsoto the necessity for an escort which has taken a convoy out, being in position to meet anincoming convoy.,(ii) (iii) and (iv) can be lumped together and car.se

a delay of about 1^ days in a voyage of ten days,  i.e. avoyage which would normally take 10 days takes,  in convoy,lit days.This delay amounts to:-if days on the Halifax route.2f. days on the Sierra Leone route.1   day on the Gibraltar route.(g) In Convoy from the Western Approaches toDischarging Port.The reverse of (a) which gives a delay of just over one day.(Note..    A further delay of about 1-^-2 days occursif ships are proceeding to an East Coastdestination).(a)Outwardvoyage.To summarise the above delays;[Delay at Home Convoy AssemblyPort.In convoy to Western ApproachesHomeward&apos;voyage.(b)(Prom Western Approaches to(    discharging Port.(d) Prom loading port to ConvoyAs assembly Port,(e) Delay at Convoy Assembly Port(f) Prom Convoy Assembly Port to western Approaches..(g) Prom Western Approaches todischaring Port..Totals.Med.4.0 days1.0     &quot;1.04. 01.01.0tiitOtherDestina-tions.1.5 days,1.0.    &quot;or .01.0.    &quot;1.04.02.51.0itit12.012.0      &quot;or13.0 days,Prom which it will be seen that the normal average delaysdue to Convoy, and Admiralty Control, on any of the threeocean routes should amount to 12 days.
