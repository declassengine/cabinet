I was invited at the same time to investigates inconsultation v/ith the Departments concerneds the possibilitiesof a further development-    of facilities for training the skilled labour required for war purposess and to report to the WarCabinet on the measures already adopted for this purpose s andon any further measures proposed.3. After consultation with the Ministers concerned., i submit for the consideration of the War Cabinet the conclusionsset out below.     I d^al first with the problem of obtainingstatistics of employment and secondly with the question   oftraining.II. THE PROBLEM OF OBTAINING STATISTICS OF EMPLOYMENT.(a) Estimation of the rate at which the labour requirements of the industries affected byj^ie.J3eryice programmes are being met.4.     The present need for the collection of statistics

relating to the employed population in the main industrialgroupa arises from the fact that in existing conditions wehave no means of measuring the scale of employment in the armament groups9 sinces owing to the extensive transfers fromone industry to another inevitable in war time and other causes,the normal method of estimating changes of employment indifferent industries is no longer practicable in the period between one annual count in July and the next-      Even when thespecial measures indicated in this report have been put intoeffect j the July count will remain of paramount importance, since it is the only basis by which accurate and comprehensivecomparison with previous figures can be made.      It is particularly important 5. therefore, that the results of the count to be takennext July should be mads available as rapidly as possible thereafter,5. In order both to bridge the gap until the results of the july count are available and thereafter to provide a means forascertaining the most significant changes in employments steps should at once be taken to arrange for the periodical collectionfrom all employers in industries which are of importance to thewar effort (including the export trade) of a return showing thenumber of persons in their employment (excepting perhaps those employed- in a clerical capacity)P distinguishing between themain occupational groups5 and between men, womens boys, and &quot;.&apos;h&apos;ls;      In order not to make unduly heavy demands onemployers9 I consider that this return should be obtained atquarterly intervals only,.      It should however be supplemented by returns prepared monthly on a sample    basis 5 since theinformation thus obtained * m^ke it    possible to frameestimates of the position at dates between the quarterlyreturns.6. As regards the scope of the proposed, return3 the Minister

15 b of Labour has sugce-sted that in the first instance it shouldbe confined to the iallowing industrial groups4&quot;:-Engineerings etc;    construction and Repair of Vehicles.,Shipbuilding and Ship Repairing.,Once the first return has been made, it should, be extended inthe light of the experience so secured to cover the group&quot;Other Metal industries&apos; and also on the one hand thoseindustrial groups which, though not normally regarded asarmament industries, are nevertheless essential to our war effort, and on the other hand- those groups specially concernedwith the export trade     As regards the first of these classes,the industrial groups in regard to which the Ministry of Supplyand the Air Ministry are anxious to obtain information regardingemployment include the following:-   Chemicals,    Paints,    Oils,etc;    Leather and Leather Goods;    Clothing:    Woodworking etc;Rubber;    Scientific and Photographic Instruments and Apparatus,,Textiles and Metal Manufacture are examples of groups inrespect of which information is required both from the pointof view of Supply and from that of the export tradec7. The return to be completed by each individual firmshould show also the class of work on which it is engaged andso far as possible the final destination of its products, e.g.whether for the home market, the export trade, or the Governmentservicec      It must be realised, however, that, as regards thelatter particulars, some employers, e.,g\, sub-contractors andfirms selling through merchants, will in most cases beignorant of the final destination of their products,,8. The Minister of Labour has made himself responsiblefor the collection of those statistics, and. will for thispurpose make use of the facilities offered by the Employment*   Throughout this paragraph the titles employed for theindustrial groups are used in the same sense as inthe Ministry of Labour Gazette.

As regards the first of these classes,the industrial groups in regard to which the Ministry of Supplyand the Air Ministry are anxious to obtain information regardingemployment include the following:-   Chemicals,    Paints,    Oils,etc,;    Leather and Leather Goods;    Clothing:    Woodworking etc.;Rubber;    Scientific and Photographic Instruments and Apparatus,Textiles and.

ISExchangeso      As regards the distribution of the industrialgroups to he covered between the initial return and the moreextended subsequent returns respectively;, the Minister has agreed to consult with the various Supply Departments andwith the Board of Trade (in respect of the export trade).9. In view of the considerable labour involved infurnishing the desired particulars, I have informed, theMinister of Labour, that he has authority to make it clear inthe communication which he is to add.ress to employers that heis acting on the express direction of the Government.Similarly, I have informed the Minister of Labour that he hasauthority to make use of any existing compulsory powers tosecure the furnishing by emploj^ers of such particulars as arerequired, and, in so far as these powers may not be siifficient,to arrange for an appropriate Order to be made under theDefence RegulationsQ10.       A certain amount of preliminary work in connection(for example) with the form of the return to be adopted andwith consultations with the employers will be necessary before a date can be fixed for obtaining the first return;   but it isimportant that, subject to avoiding-the. period where employment will be abnormal owing to the incidence of Easter, the earliest practicable date should be selected.      I have asked theMinister of Labour, if possible, to select a date towards theend of March or in the first week in April.      The Minister ofLabour has sasured me that the results of the count will beavailable within one month of it being taken.      In view ofthe importance of securing the first return with the utmostdespatch, I have informed, the Minister of Labour that on this occasion there would be no objection to omitting the occupational analysis within each industrial group.-h-

(b) The industries from whichlabour is being drawn intothe war industries.11.       The Minister of Labour has explained that it wouldnot be possible to obtain any comprehensive return, showingthe industries from which labour has been drawn into the war industries, except by questioning each individual worker whohas entered these industries since the outbreak of war. .&apos;^uite clearly the time and expense which would be involved would be disproportionate to the value of the results- &apos;achieved.      Nevertheless,  it may be hoped that with theextension of the scope of the statistics which, as explained in the preceding paragraphs are now to be collected, it maybe possible to form certain broad conclusions on this subject.(c) Industries in which pools oflabour remain on which furtherdrafts might be made for thewar industries.12.        The sources from which the war industries must look for further recruits are the following:-(i)    the unemp1oyed;(ii)    persons not normally In theindustrial fields(iii)    persons employed in non-essential industries;(iv)    persons employed in non-essentialbranches of production in theessential industries.All necessary information regarding the unemployed is already available through the machinery of the Unemployment Insurancesystem.     As regards persons not normally in the industrial field, information is available in so far as such personsregister themselves at the Employment Exchanges;    and for therest, a limited amount of information may be obtainable whenthe results of the National Registration are available..   &apos; Asregards persons now employed in non-essential industries, itwill be necessary first for the Board of Trade and other

Departments concerned to decide on the definition of those branches of industry which are non-essential for the productionof war supplies or for the rzport trade or for the minimum requirements of the home market;    and, when this question hasbeen settled it will be necessary to obtain the requiredinformation from the employers concerned.     As regards those persons employed in non-essential branches of production inthe essential industries, the desired information will beavailable as soon as the new statistical return covers all theessential industries..13.       There is general agreement between the Departmentsconcerned that the task of seeking out reserves of labour for transfer to the war industries is pre-eminently one v/hichshould be carried out regionally rather than centrally.      Forthis purpose, therefore, the fullest advantage should betaken of the facilities offered by the -h?ea Boards now being set up by the Liinistrj&apos;- of Supply in consultation with the otherSupply Departments.      The importance and urgency of this problem should be specially impressed upon the Area Boards;and I have asked, the Minister of Labour to communicate to theMinister of Supply particulars of the points to which special attention should be givenc     These should include (i)    thefact that this duty has been placed upon the Area Boards bythe express direction of the war Cabinet, and (ii) the needfor ensuring that inroads are not made on the labour force of firms engaged in the export trade.     At the same time the area boards should be instructed to furnish periodically reportsof the progress achieved in the task now laid upon them.

(a)    Training for the engineering industry.14. The number of places in the Ii.i.n:u. ,ry of Labour&apos;straining centres has recently been inerea^ds; and allpossible advantage should be taken of the Centres, ifnecessary, by reducing the period of training where thisproves to be practicable and by the institution of double shifts and similar devices.      It is importanthowever to emphasise the fact that the principal burdenof training labour must rest on industry itself,  andthat training in Government Centres cannot,  and shouldnots be more than an auxiliary aid,15. At the present time, as the War Cabinet are aware,candidates for training are selected from among the ranks ofthe unemployed..      Until recently there were many vacantplaces in the Government Centres, but as the result ofthe recent drive there has, during the last four weeks,been a gratifying increase in ohe number of suitableapplicants.      If it should prove impossible, -co keepthe Centres working to capacity through voluntaryrecruiting from the unemployed, it would become necessaryto consider the adoption of other measur&amp;i.      Thefirst of these measures would be to make attendance ata Training Centre, if required,  a condition of receiving umemployment benefit.      The second would be to throwopen the Centres -co persons employed in the non-essential industries.      The adoption of the latter course wouldinvolve the payment to such persons while in training of allowances substantially equivalent to the wages whichthey had been drawing before entering the Centre,

16. The possibility that it may be found necessary toextend the number and capacity of the Government TrainingCentres should not be excluded;   but it must be realised that one of the main difficulties to be overcome would bethe provision of the necessary machine tools.     Even for theexisting centres the provision of machine  oocs has been a problem of considerable difficulty.      The Minister of Supplyhas5 howevers offered to assist in this matter by providingused machine tools which cannot readily be adapted to thepurpose of munitions production.17. The provision of additional accommodation fortraining should prove less difficult.    The President of theBoard of Education hass for example9 indicated, that it shouldbe possible to make available for this purpose certainbuildings designed for Technical Institutions which arenow vacant.18. Many of the Technical Institutions are alreadyequipped to provide training for various occupations inthe engineering industry.      The use of these facilities to supplement those provided at the Ministry of labour&apos;s Centresshould be extended as far as possible.      Care shoulclshowever., be taken to ensure that there is no interferencethereby with the long-term training policy of these institutions.      The President of the Board of education has offered to address a circular to all Local EducationAuthorities for Higher Education,, emphasising thenational importance of utilising these institutionsto the fullest extent practicablei    and I have asked him to proceed accordingly.      The value of the role

to be played by these institutions depends to a considerabextent on the view taken as to the period over v/hich the-demand for trained labour in the engineering industryis likely to persist.      I consider that the line to befollowed in this matter should be the same as that already prescribed by the War Cabinet in the case ofmunitions produetion3 namely,,  that the programme shouldbe planned to cover a period, of at least three years from the outbreak of the war,(b)    Training for the shipbuilding industry.19. In view of the extreme importance of ourachieving the increased programme of merchant ship-building v/hich we have set ourselves, it is essentialthat no delays should be permitted through avoidableshortages of labour in the shipyards.      The Ministerof Laboup has be n in special co.iSi-lc.tion on this sub-ject with the Shipbuilding Employers Federation9who have expressed, the view that the training requiredto enable them to increase their labour force canbe imparted more satisfactorily in the shipbuildingyards themselves than in the Government Cenores.The Federation haves however  indicated, informally thai:they may find it necessary to ask for a contribution from the Exchequer towards the cost of the trainingso afforded.

IVo    SUMMARY OF COMOhUSIOIIS,20.       The following is a summary of the arrangements which, in accordance with the War Cabinet&apos;s request, Ihave made to secure the preparation of statistics ofemployment:-(i) Arrangements will he made by the Ministerof Labour to obtain from employers in theindustrial groups of importance to our war effort (including the export trade):-(a) a quarterly Return from each employershowingi-(l) The number of persons employed,(excepting perhaps those in aclerical capacity) distinguishing between the main occupationalgroups, and between men, women,boys and girls?(2) the class of work on which the firmis engaged, and so far as possiblethe final   destination of itsproducts (ioe0 the home market, theexport trade or the government service);(paragraphs 4 and 5)(b) monthly returns, prepared on a samplebasis, for use in framing estimate:&apos;of the employment position at datesbetween the quarterly returns;(paragraph 7)(ii) In the first of the returns to be compiled,the industrial groups to be covered will include the following;-(a) Engineering, etc,; Construction and repair of Vehicles-(b) Shipbuilding and Ship Repairing,.(iii) In later returns, other industrial groupswill be added, in order to provide information regarding;-(a) the group known as &quot;Other MetalIndustries&quot;;(b) those industrial groups which, though not normally regarded as armament industries are nevertheless essential to our war effort;(c) those groups of special importance fromthe point of view of the export trade.(paragraph 6)(iv) For the above purpose the Minister of labour has agreed to consult with the variousSupply Departments and. with the Board ofTrade in regard to the distribution of the-10-

industrial Groups between the first, andthe later more comprehensiva-rretoirjis^.r.ss$^ec4^Lvely;.(paragraph 8)(v) In view of the considerable labour involved infurnishing the desired partictilars, I have&quot;informed the Minister of Labour, that he hasauthority to italic it clear in the coinmunicationwhich he is to address to employers that he is acting on the express direction of theGovernments    Similarly, I have informed theMinister of Labour that he has authority tomake use of any existing compulsory powersto secure the furnishing by employers of suchparticulars as are required, and in so far as these powers may not be sufficient to arrangefor an appropriate Order to be made under theDefence &quot;regulationsj(paragraph 9)(vi) It is important that,  subject to avoiding the period where employment will be abnormalowing to the incidence of Easier, theearliest practicable date should be selected for the first return,    I have asked the Ministerof Labour,  if possible, to select a date towardsthe end of March or in the first week in April.The Minister of Labour has assured me that theresults of the count will be available within one month of it being taken,    In view of theimportance of securing the first return withthe utmost despatch, I have informed the Ministerof Labour that on this occasion there will be noobjection to omitting the occupational analysiswithin each industrial group *(paragraph 10)SI.       As regards the second of the questions relatingto employment referred to me by the War Cabinet for examination, I have reached the conclusions-that specific inquiry to ascertain fromwhich industries labour has been drawn intothe war industries would not be justified;but that with the later extension of the scopeof the statistics, referred to in paragraph 20 above,it may be possible to form certain broadconclusions on this subject;(paragraph 11).22.       Turning to the third of the questions relatingto employment referred to me by the War Cabinet,  Isummarise my conclusions as follows;--(i) the task of seeking out reserves oflabour for transfer to the war industries is pre-eminently one v/hich should becarried out regionally rather than centrally;(paragraph 13)

(il)   the fuller.t advantage should thereforehe taken of the facilities offered by theArea Boards now being set up by theMinistry of Supply in consultation withthe other Supply Departments;    and Ihave asked the Minister of Labour tocommunicate to the Minister of Supplyparticulars of the points to which special attention should be given, including:-(a) the fact that this duty has beenplaced upon the Area Boards by the express direction of the Y7ar Cabinet;(b) the need for ensuring that inroadsare not made on the labour force of firms engaged in the export trade.At the same time the Area Boards should be instructed, to furnish periodically reportsof the progress achieved in the task nowlaid upon them; - (paragraph 13)(iii)    In order to assist the Area Boards in their task of seeking out industries in which poolsof labour remain on which further draftsmight be made for the war industries, theBoard, of Trade and other Departments concerned should decide on the definition of those branches of production which are non-essential for the   rocluction of war supplies or for theexport trade or for the minirman requirements- ofthe home market; paragraph 12)23. As regards training for industry, my conclusions are as follows:-(i)    The principal burden of training labour must rest on industry itself, and training inGovernment Centres cannot, and should not,be more than an auxiliary aid;    (paragraph 14)(ii)    All possible advantages should be taken ofthe Ministry of Labour&apos;s Training Centres,  ifnece.es. r&quot;, by reoLucing the jeeriod of trainingwhere this nroves   to be practicable andby the institution of double shifts and similardevices: (paragraph 14)(iii)    As the result of the recent drive, therehas during the last four weeks been asubstantial increase in the number ofa-o-olicants for training at the Ministryof&quot; Lab our Centres: (paragraph 15)

(iv)(v)(vi)(vii)If it should prove impossible to keep the centres working to capacity throughvoluntary recruiting from the unemployedit will become necessary to consider theadoption of other measures, including:-(a) The -making of attendance at a training Centre, If recprired, acondition of receiving unemploymentbenefit;(b) the opening of the Centres to personsemployed in the non-essential industries, though this would involvethe payment to such persons while intraining of allowances substantiallyequivalent to the wages which they hadbeen drawing before entering the Centre;(paragraph 15)One of the chief difficulties in connexionwith Training Centres is the provision of machine tools;    the Minister of Supply hasoffered, to assist in this matter by providingused   r.chine tools which cannot readily be adapted, to the purpose of munitions production;(paragraph 16)The provision of accommodation for training should prove less difficulto      The Presidentof the Board of Education has, for example,indicated that it should be possible to make available for this purpose certain buildingsdesigned, for Technical Institutions which arenow vacant; (paragraph 17)Many of the Technical Institutions are alreadyequipped to provide training for variousoccupations in the engineering Industry-.The use of these facilities to supplementthose provided at the Ministry of Labour&apos;sCentres should be extended as far as possible.Care should however, be taken xo ensure thatthere is no interference thereby with thelong-term training policy of these institutions.The President of the Board of Education hasoffered, to address a circular to all LocalEducation Authorities for Higher Education,emphasising the national importance ofutilising these institutions to the efullest extent practicable;    and I have asked himto proceed, accordinglyo      The value of the role to be played by these institutionsdepends to a considerable extent on the view taken as to the period over which the demandfor trained, labour in the engineering industryis likely to persist.      I consider that theline to be followed in this matter should bethe sr. :e as that already prescribed by the WarCabinet in the case of munitions production,namely that the programme should be planned tocover a period of at least three years from theoutbreak&quot; of the war.
