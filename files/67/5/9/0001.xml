THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT./?SECRET. COPY NO .-W.P.(G) (40)59.WAR CABINET.THE SHIPPING SITUATION IN RELATION TO AGRICULTURE.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Agriculture.1. In the light of the situation set out in thememorandum &quot;by the Minister of Shipping (W.P.(G) (40 ) 42) andin the Report of the Lord Privy Seal (W,P.  (40) 64) it seems clear that we must assume that a cut in the import programme for 1940 is inevitable.     The Minister of Shipping&apos;smemorandum states that in certain not improbable circumstances the import programme on-the basis of 47 million tons v/illhave to be reduced by 10 per cent, or probably more.     i accordingly assume a reduction of 10 per cent, for thepurposes of what follows.2. The memorandum by the Minister of Food (W.P.(G) (40)51) clearly shows that, on the assumption that cuts in the programmes of the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry ofFood are made pro rata,  a 10 per cent, reduction in theMinistry of Food&apos;s programme, v/hich is at present based onthe figure of 19,800,000 tons, would have to be mainly at theexpense of animal feeding-stuffs.3. The effect of this is applied over the whole field of livestock husbandry would inevitably have a very serious, ifnot disastrous effect, on our agricultural output and farmorganisation.      It would involve a reduction in milk output and a reduction in cattle and sheep, with a consequentialloss in fertility.     No less it would involve a disturbance9 to farm organisation which could only result in a less of

efficiency and increased costs.      This is the case &quot;becauseon almost every farm the farm economy depends on the balance ofa number of different enterprises, the one depending on the other.      For example, the arable farmer looks tohis yard-fed bullocks to produce manure for maintainingcrop yields.     To disturb this balance may often make all the difference between success and failure.      TheMinistry of Food suggest that some reduction could bemade by reducing imports of oil seeds, but such areduction would have a particularly harmful effect fromthe   point of view of milk production and the maintenanceof the livestock population.4.     For reasons such as these, if a cut of this kindwere made in the quantity of imported animal feeding-stuffs and if our aim were to cause a minimum of dislocation tothe farming industry such a reduction would, in practice,have to be at the expense of &quot;pigs and poultry.      Mycolleagues are already aware that, as regards existingsupplies of imported feeding-stuffs, the principle ofgiving priority to mill: production and cattle, with the consequence that the main reduction of supplies fallsupon producers of pigs and poultry, has already beenadopted and a public announcement in this connection wasmade on November 22nd, 1939.5.      I feel bound to point out, however, that if asis necessary we now applied the same principle to theproposed additional cut in the supplies of imported&apos;feeding-stuffs (i,e. about of 2 million tons) there wouldbe no hope of escaping some dislocation&apos; in the farmindustry, since a cut of this size, if actually applied topigs and poultry, would extinguish these industriesaltogether.      On many of our mixed farms pigs and poultryafford an important and economical adjunct to the mainfarm enterprises and their disappearance could not takeplace without,- to some extent at least, causing

inefficiency and loss in the farm as a whole.     Specialisedproducers would of course he ruined.6.       But this is not all.      A reduction of 2 million tonsin imports of feeding-stuffs could only effect a corresponding reduction in the Ministry of Food&apos;s import programme as a wholeif the domestic production of pigs and poultry were not replaced by imports of pig-meat and poultry products, a course which  /ould mean a drastic reduction in supplies of human food.      If our object were therefore (a)  to reduce the Ministry of Food&apos;s totalimports by about 2 million tons, (b)  to avoid a reduction inhuman consumption, and (c) to attain these results by a reductionof imported feeding-stuffs alone, it follows that this latterreduction would have to be much greater, probably many timesgreater, than 2 million tons.      Such a reduction would bringdisaster to domestic agriculture which no re-adjustment under war-time conditions could overcome.7.        I feel bound therefore to raise what seems to me thefundamental issue before us.      The present rigid distinctionbetween the allocation of the tonnage allotted to the Ministry of food and the Ministry of Supply respectively is unsound;    itimplies, amongst other things, that any reduction in the shippingprogramme must involve a disproportionately large reduction inanimal- feeding-stuffs.So        It is essential to recognise that there is a minimumrequirement of food necessary to maintain the population and thatit is impossible to reduce total food supplies below this minimum and that essential foodstuffs for human consumption must thereforetake preference over animal feeding-stuffs.9.       The issue as I see it in the light of the considerationsI have set out above is therefore the question of priority inallotting tonnage as between feeding-stuffs and materials.      I do not suggest that there should be a separate allocation for animal feeding-stuffs since the import of  these commodities is largely bound up with the import of human foodstuffs required by the Ministry of

Food, i.e. oil seeds are required for the production of oilfor margarine and cereal feeding-stuffs are hound up withimports of wheat for human consumption.     But there is atpresent no independent and impartial machinery for deciding whether priority should he given to essential animal feeding-stuffs over certain of the materials imported on account ofthe Ministry of Supply.      I believe such machinery to benecessary.10.   There are further reasons for this conclusion.      such machinery is especially desirable for deciding priorities incases of emergency.     At present any increase in imports of essential feeding-stuffs has to be at the expense of essentialfoods.     For example, the position in regard to the supply ofoilcake which hitherto we. had understood would be satisfactory,has in recent weeks suddenly deteriorated, necessitatingemergency action.     As a result steps have been taken by theMinistry of Food,  on the instructions of the Official Sub-Committee on Food Policy, to import, as an emergency measure,10,000 tons of cotton seed cake from Egypt.      This shipment had,however, to come out of the Ministry of Food&apos;s allocationi.ee it had to be made at the expense of imports of food,whereas it might have been preferable that it should have beenmade at the expense of some materials coming under the Ministryof Supply allocation.11.   Another important aspect of the question is timing.Many materials in the Ministry of Supply&apos;s programme arelong range requirements, whereas the need for animal feeding-stiiffs may be, and is at the moment, immediate, e.g. they are particularly required during the winter months.     This is a consideration which ought, in my view, to be taken into account in arranging imports over the year.(Intld.) R.h.D - SoMinistry of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries,23rd February, 1940.
