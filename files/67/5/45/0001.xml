Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 95.April 2, 1940.WAR CABINET.CONSULTATION WITH THE DOMINIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN September last a Ministerial Committee, under the chairmanship ofLord Hankey, met &quot; to consider the existing system of collaboration with theDominions; how far it meets the needs of the present situation; and to make suggestions for any improvements that are considered desirable.&quot;2. Lord Hankey&apos;s Committee took the view that it was unlikely that the PrimeMinisters of any of the Dominions would be in a position to make the journeyto the United Kingdom at that time when they were faced with such pressingproblems in their respective countries. The probability that this country mightbe subjected to a heavy scale of air attack, and the heavy pressure on the WarCabinet were also given as reasons for caution in suggesting a gathering ofDominion Prime Ministers at an early date. The Committee therefore put asidefrom their immediate recommendations the idea of an Imperial War Cabinet,though considering that the possibility of any such meeting of Prime Ministers,probably under a different title, should be kept in mind as a possible laterdevelopment.3. As an alternative they suggested that an invitation should be sent to thevarious Dominion Governments to send a Minister to London for consultation.This invitation was given and accepted, and meetings with Dominion Ministersduly took place in October and November.4. The result of these meetings was very valuable at the time. I feel, however,that the discussions have become rather out of date, and I am strongly of opinionthat a renewal of personal contact with Dominion Ministers would now bedesirable.5. It was made clear to the Dominion Prime Ministers in conveying the invitation last autumn that, as matters stood then, the Prime Minister wouldnot &quot; feel justified in suggesting a personal meeting between Prime ministers in London.&quot; This, however, carried the implication that, at a later stage, sucha suggestion could appropriately be made, and I consider that the time has now come when it would be desirable to put it forward. It is essential that everyeffort should be made on our part to ensure that the Dominion Governments and peoples are satisfied that they are taken as fully as possible into our confidence and have an effective opportunity of making their views heard in relation to matters of vital policy.6. The only difficulty arises from a doubt whether, in present circumstances, itwould be practicable for some at any rate of the Prime Ministers to spare thetime for the journey to this country. Mr. Mackenzie King, after his success inthe General Election, would no doubt be well able to visit this country if he were willing to do so. Mr. Menzies, on the other hand, is faced with a GeneralElection this year, and, in any case, his political position, even now that a[21081]
coalition with the Country Party has been achieved, might make it difficult for him to absent himself from Australia. Similarly, in General Smuts&apos; case, somuch depends upon him personally that he may not find it easy to leave SouthAfrica. As regards New Zealand, Mr. Fraser, who will presumably be the newPrime Minister, was, in fact, the Minister who visited London last autumn.7. In spite of these difficulties, I am clear that it is right that the proposal should be put forward to the Dominion Governments. If the attempt to arrangesuch a Conference fails, other special means of securing personal contact could beconsidered in consultation with the Dominion Governments, but, as a first step,the suggestion of a Prime Ministers&apos; Conference would appear the proper course.8. The time of the suggested Conference would, to some extent, depend on the convenience of the Dominion Prime Ministers themselves, but we might propose the late summer, say, July or August, as a possibility.9. The invitation should go to the Prime Ministers of Canada, the Common-wealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa, and I imagine that the Secretary of State for India would wish a similar invitation conveyed to the Government of India. The question whether Southern Rhodesia andpossibly Burma should also be invited to send observers as at the time of theImperial Conference of 1937 would also have to be considered. For my part, inview of the very special war effort which Southern Rhodesia is making, I should like to see an invitation sent to the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. Asthe Conference would deal with the war there could be no question of invitingEire.10. As to the title and scope of the proposed Conference, I think it essentialthat it should be described as an &quot; Imperial War Conference &quot; and not as aCabinet. A note on this point giving some reference to the past history isattached as Appendix I.11. I attach as Appendix II the draft of a telegram which, if the principle is approved, might be sent to the four Dominion Prime Ministers.A. E.Dominions Office, S.W. 1.
APPENDIX I.DURING the war of 1914-18, as a result of the increasing share whichthe Dominions took in the prosecution of the war, it was felt to be necessary togive those Governments an opportunity of participating in the deliberationswhich determined the main outlines of policy. Accordingly, in September 1916,the Prime Minister of each of the self-governing Dominions was invited toattend a series of special meetings of the War Cabinet for the discussion of questions affecting the prosecution of the war; the Viceroy of India was askedto send representatives for a similar purpose.   These invitations were accepted.2. The Conference assembled in the early part of 1917, and, for the sake of convenience, was held in two parts. On the one side were meetings of whatcame to be known as the Imperial War Cabinet, which consisted of the oversearepresentatives and the members of the United Kingdom War Cabinet, sitting-together for deliberation on the conduct of the war and for the discussion of larger issues of policy connected with the war. On the other side was theImperial War Conference, presided over by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,which dealt with matters of less importance and with certain problems not directly connected with the war. The first session of the Imperial War cabinet was held in the early part of 1917; the next series began in June 1918, and thethird series in November 1918, considered questions relating to the peace settle-ment and was followed by the Peace Conference in which the Dominion PrimeMinisters took part.3. With the development of the Imperial Conference system since the war,the distinction drawn in 1917 and 1918 between Imperial War Cabinet and imperial War Conference has tended to disappear. Meetings of an ImperialConference are now presided over by the United Kingdom Prime Minister, and,so far as the last two Conferences are concerned, have consisted of meetings of&quot; Heads of Delegations,&quot; i.e., of the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdomand the Dominions, with one or more other Ministers, and the principal repre-sentatives of India, to deal with major questions of policy, other matters oflesser or more technical importance being dealt with by Committees, the reportsof which have been brought before the &quot; Heads of Delegations &quot; for final approval.4. The use of the term &quot; Imperial War Cabinet &quot; gave rise at the time, andmight give rise now, to some confusion. The position was complicated by the factthat the United Kingdom War Cabinet included a Dominion statesman in theperson of General Smuts. His position was constitutionally very peculiar.Though not a member of the United Kingdom Parliament he was a member of theUnited Kingdom War Cabinet; he did not take his place as a representative ofthe Dominion Governments generally or the Union Government in particular, butas a person regarded as suitable to be a member of the United Kingdom WarCabinet by reason of his special knowledge and experience. Even if there were,at the present day, a Dominion representative who occupied the same position as general Smuts in 1917 and 1918, this would not affect the constitutional positionor the quite separate character of the Imperial War Cabinet, or whatever it might now be called, as the body representative of all the Governments of the BritishCommonwealth.5. The constitutional position was well described by Sir Robert Borden, thenPrime Minister of Canada, in 1918 in the following terms : &quot; I see no incongruity whatever in applying the term &apos; Cabinet&apos; to theassociation of Prime Ministers and other Ministers who meet around acommon Council Board to debate and determine the various needs of theEmpire. If I should attempt to describe it I should say it is a Cabinet of governments Every Prime Minister who sits around that Board is responsible to his own Parliament and to his own people; the conclusions ofthe War Cabinet can only be carried out by the Parliaments of the different
nations of our Imperial Commonwealth. Thus, each Dominion, each Nation,retains its perfect autonomy.&quot;Although Sir Robert Borden was prepared to accept the term &quot; Cabinet,&quot; heused it in a sense which would not be that ordinarily accepted as the implicationof the term, and it is perhaps, therefore, desirable, to avoid any possible ambiguity.If, therefore, it is decided to summon a meeting of Dominion Ministers, the best course would be to describe it as an Imperial Conference, thus showing that con-stitutionally it stands on the same footing as the Conferences of 1926, 1930and 1937.APPENDIX II.Draft Telegram to the Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia,.New Zealand and the Union of South Africa.(Most Secret.)(Circular D. No.       .)FOLLOWING from Prime Minister for Prime Minister : Begins: We have been considering further the system of collaboration between the Governments of the British Commonwealth with the object of examining whether any suggestions can be put forward for securing the closest possible contact and co-operation.2. We have been much impressed by the value of the meetings with dominion ministers in London last autumn which took place following upon the suggestionconveyed in telegram Circular D. No. 19 of the 21st September.3. The problems confronting us are of such importance and the need for our being completely satisfied that we fully understand and can meet each other&apos;spoint of view is so important that I feel that the time has now come when thebest course is to arrange for a meeting of Prime Ministers. I appreciate thedifficulties which Dominion Prime Ministers might well feel in leaving their own countries in present circumstances, but, notwithstanding these difficulties, I am confident that the advantages to be derived from such a meeting are so great thatI very much hope that you will find it practicable to arrange to attend aConference. I feel that, in present circumstances, such a Conference could most appropriately be held in this country, and I hope very much, therefore, that youwill be able to come to London in the near future for the purpose of a meeting. Ishould be glad to arrange a time most convenient to you and the other PrimeMinisters; subject to your views, I should be inclined to suggest that July orearly August of this year might be most suitable.4. I should be glad to learn from you at your early convenience whether you agree in general with the proposal for the holding of such a Conference, and, if so, whether you yourself would be able to come to London at the time suggested.I should not contemplate that anything in the nature of a detailed agenda need be prepared. The subject for discussion would clearly be the joint war effort inall its aspects, and an opportunity might be afforded for, at any rate, thepreliminary consideration of the problems of post-war reconstruction. But ifthere are any particular problems which you would wish to see raised, you would no doubt let me know.5. If it is decided to hold such a Conference, it would, I think, be desirablethat every precaution should be taken on security grounds to keep the intentionsecret as long as possible.
