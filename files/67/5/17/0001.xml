THIS IXX3UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVKRNx/ESNT.SECRET.W.P.(G)(40)67. COPY NO.      \MAR CABINETDependants&apos; AllowanceMemorandum by the Minister of labour-ar.d National Service.1.      In W.P. (G) (40)62 dated 27th February, 194-0, the Secretary of Statefor War proposes to relax the present condition for a dependant&apos;allowance that the dependant shall he incapable of self-support.     Inparagraph 7 of his Memorandum he refers to a suggestion made by myDepartment (as an alternative to the Secretary of State&apos;s proposal)that the condition as to incapacity for self-support should be modified so as to enable an allowance to be paid to an individual who, thoughcapable of self-support, is unable to obtain suitable employment.2.     Further discussions have now taken place between the two departments as a result of which I am satisfied the suggested alternative would giverise to complications and difficulties in administration, which would be out of proportion to the numbers concerned or to advantage likely to be gained.     In the circumstances I do not wish to raise any objection tothe proposal of the Secretary of State to remove the condition inquestion altogether.(Intd.)     E.3.28th February, 194Q.H.Q.664--75 B.J.
