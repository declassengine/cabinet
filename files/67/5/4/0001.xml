LOSS OF IMPORTING GAPAjQITY DUETO MARINE CASUALTIES.I. INTRODUCTORY.In time of war it is inevitable that there should bea substantial increase in the volume of marine casualtiesdue to collisions, nagivation in the dark, and similarcauses.     We are to-day suffering marine casualties on alarge scale, since not only is the number of total lossesconsiderable but the number of casualties not involving a total loss is also extremely high.       I submit the present report onthe subject since, as explained in my general survey of our shipping difficulties (Paper W.P.(40)64),  the exceptional amountof marine casualties sustained in war time is one of the abnormal factors which reduces what would otherwise be the importing capacity of the shipping at our disposal.II. THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE ATPRESENT SUFFERING&quot; MARINE CASUALTIES.(a)   Total losses.2. In all our discussions of the shipping problem, theextent to which we are suffering loss of tonnage through enemy action has naturally played an important part;      and it was largely on this account that we decided recently to increase our merchant shipbuilding programme from 1 million gross tons to 1*5 million gross tons per annum.     It is not generallyrealised however that losses due to enemy action since theoutbreak of war represent only about three-quarters (77 per cent)of our total losses, 23 per cent being attributable to marinecasualties.      Losses due to enemy action and marine casualtiesrespectively from the outbreak of war up to the 18th February,

1940,  the latest date for which figures were, available areas follows:-Total losses (excluding tanker tonnage and tonnageof all kinds of less than 500 gross tons) lost as theresult of enemy action and marine casualties * sincethe outbreak of war to 13th February, 1940.Cause of loss.Enemy action.Ships lost.(Number of ships)107Tonnage lost.(Thousands of gross tons).467Marine casualties.3213997564It will be seen that the losses due to marine casualties whenexpressed in terms of gross tonnage bear a smaller proportion to our total losses than when expressed in terms of numbersof ships lost.3. The same losses may be expressed as percentages asfollows:-Total losses (excluding tanker tonnage and tonnageof all kinds of less than 500 gross tons) lost asthe result of enemy action and marine casualtiessince the outbreak of war to 18th February, 1940expressed as percentages.Cause of lossEnemy actionPercentage ofships lost.77Percentage of gross tonnagelost.S3Marine casualties2317100100

(b) Losses not amounting to total losses.4,       When we turn from marine casualties which-involvethe total loss of the ship to those such as injuries dueto collisions, etc., we find that here also the rate atwhich casualties are being sustained is very high.    thus in the months of December 1939 and January 1940 (thelast two calendar months for which figures are available)there were as many as 415 marine casualties sustained by British vessels.    Of these casualties 215 were sustained in the month of December and 200 in January.    Thenature of the casualties in question, many of whichfortunately are of a minor character, is illustrated by the following particulars of the actual casualtiessustained on the first two days of the period underreview:-1st December, 1939.Collisions 7Grounded 4Damage toShell and bewplate 1Fire in after hold     1Sprang a Leak 1Unspecified 1152nd December, 1939.Collisions 5Grounded 3Machinery defect 2Damaged throughbad weather 2Leak in engine room. 1135. The volume of merchant shipping, which on theaverage is at any one time either damaged or under

repair, is of great importance, since such tonnageis a deduction to be made from our capacity to import goods to this country.    Figures are not available at themoment showing separately on the one hand the number and tonnage of ships damaged and repairing, and on theother hand the number and tonnage of ships dockingfor annual overhaul and survey;   but even so, thefollowing figures obtained by a count made on the 31stJanuary, 1940, of ships falling in both   classes are significant:-Merchant shipping (i) damaged,  (ii) repairing,and (iii) docking for annual overhaul andsurvey at 51st January, 1940.Number ofshipsVessels of 500to 1,599 grosstons 51Vessels of1,600 grosstons and overGrosstonnage(thousands of grosstons)49Deadweightcapacity(thousands of tons)581408091,094Total 191 858 1,1526.       Thus on 31st January, 1940 the deadweight capacityof the merchant shipping, either damaged or repairingor docking for annual overhaul and survey, amountedto 1.152 million tons.    On the supposition that tonnageof this amount is constantly not available for these

causes, and after making appropriate deductionson account of bunkers and other necessaryallowances, we may consider that, in existing conditions, this amount of deadweight tonnageis equivalent to an importing capacity of a littleover 5 million tons per annum.7. This is one of the substantial itemsfor which the Ministry of Shipping automaticallymake allowance in calculating the annualimporting capacity of the deadweight capacityof our mercantile marine.    It should perhaps be added that the average number of shipsincapacitated at any given time as the resultof damage   nflicted by the enemy or the resultof marine casualties, is likely to increase fora time until the repairing yards catch up thearrears of work, and a new equilibrium is established.    On the other hand the advent ofbetter weather and longer hours of light duringthe summer months will tend to diminish marinerisks.

III.      POSSIBLE METHODS OF ^ EDUCING &apos; :rriE PP.ESSN&apos;?&apos;RATE OF MARINE O^SII. JgT^8. In view oi&quot; the number and nature of the marinecasualties which we are now sustaining, the Minister ofShipping is examining the question whether these have been caused in part by some general causes in addition to themore obvious difficulties of navigation in time of war,and proposes shortly to discuss these questions with theAdmiralty.      The questions so being considered are thefollowing:-(a) Extra amount of coasting work by deepsea ships and congestion of tonnageJLn harbours and estuaries^9. The number of collisions at night in harbours andestuaries since the outbreak of war has been exceptionally high.      The Minister of Shipping proposes therefore toraise the question whether additional navigation lightsmight be permitted, and if so,  subject to what safeguards.(b) Extinction or -alteration of shorelightinga10.        The extinocion or alteration of shore lightingconsequent upon the outbreak of war has certainly increased the dangers of stranding in the case of deep sea vessels,The Minister of Shipping holds the view that it is particular-ly important that route!ng instructions should be drafted in the clearest possible manner and in the simplest possibleform, and he proposes to raise the question whether any improvement in the form of existing instructions could be made from this point of view.

Excessive dimming of lights in certain cases.There is some reason to think that not all vessels use the Admiralty standard dimming screen andthat some vessels dim their lights unnecessarily.      Itis clearly desirable that full advantage should betaken of whatever lighting standard is laid down, andthat any steps necessary to secure this end should betaken.(d)    Possibility of relaxing lighting restrictions for ships sailing indistant waters,12, The Minister of Shipping proposes also toraise with the Admiralty the question whether it isnecessary for ships to sail with lights extinguished incertain distant waters, e.g. the Indian Ocean.    If itwere found possible to relax this regulation in the caseof ships sailing in such waters, the risk of marinecasualties being sustained by such ships would be considerably reduced.due to failure by ships in convoy to keep station.     Itis therefore very desirable to secure any possibleimprovement in the keeping of station by ships in convoyand otherwise to improve the procedure to be followed(e)    Navigation in convoy.13.A considerable number of collisions has been by ships in convoy where opportunities for suchimprovement are suggested by experience.     Thes.stions are under constant consideration by the Ministryof Shipping in conjunction with the Admiralty.

(f)    Excessive strain on navigating and other officers. on certain routes.Ik. The Minister of Shipping holds the view that someof the marine casualties suffered may have &quot;been due in parts to the excessive strain upon the navigating and other officers inevitable on certain routes under war conditions.It is of course essential to maintain full complements ofdeck officers and hands and also the supply of trainedsignallers.      On the other hand the granting of adequateperiods of leave, especially to navigating officers, isalso highly desirable.      It will be realised, however, thatthese objects are difficult to reconcile with securing thequickest practicable turn round in port.     All thesequestions are kept under close review by the Ministry ofShipping.IV. LABOUR AND RAW MATERIALS FOR SHIPREPAIRING-.15. Normally different slips are used for ship repairingand shipbuilding, and from this point of view therefore thedemand for slips for shipbuilding is not competitive withthat for ship repairing.     Both shipbuilding and shiprepairing require similar labour and materials;    and it isvery important therefore that the demands on behalf shipbuilding should not be allowed to delay the carryingout of repairs, since from the point of view of increasingout net importing capacity the expenditure of a given amountof labour and material on ship repairing will normally give more rapid results than a like expenditure directed toshipbuilding.     For,this reason it is essential that all necessary   priority should be given for the relatively small quantities of steel and labour required for shiprepairing.

16. The recent transfer of ministerial responsibility for rue reliant shipbuilding and repairing to the Admiralty, by placing inthe hands of a single Department, entireresponsibility for the proper utilisation of allshipyards, whether engaged on naval or merchantshipping work, should serve to reduce to aminimum the period spent on the repair of any given ship and thus to ensure that the net loss of importing capacity due to the needfor ship repairing is reduced to the smallestdimensions possiblenV,.      SHIP REPAIRING AND the lighting RESTRUCTIONS.17. In the early days of the v/ar avoidabledelays to ship repairing occurred through localmisconceptions in regard to the nature and scope of the lighting restrictions imposed bythe Government, but the position has nowmaterially improved through the introduction ofdevices for the screening of plating work, the lighting of entrances to dry docks, theprovision of aids to movements in docks, and similar measureso     The Minister of Home Securityis in close touch with the employers who are nowthoroughly familiar with the nature of theregulations and the directions in whichrelaxations of the permitted standards may besecured in exceptional cases,     In general, theMinister is of the opinion that everything possible is now being done to reduce the delaysto ship repairing due to the Black-out.
