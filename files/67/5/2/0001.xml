THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITTANIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET COPY NO.      &quot;jW.P. (G) (24O)g2.WAR CABINETPURCHASE OF AMERICAN SHIPS.Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping.A.    CARGO SHIPS.(1)    PURCHASES TO DATE.In continuation of my Memorandum of 29th December,W.P.   (G)  (39).  166, I am now able to report that twenty-one cargo ships have been purchased in the United States, amounting to178,000 tons deadweight, at a cost of a little under  8 million.The average price of the vessels is about 0kh per deadweight tonand their average age about 20 years.    A list Is attached of thevessels bought, showing expected delivery dates.    One of them isa tanker.    Managing owners have been nominated, who have thearrangements in hand for bringing the vessels into our service.Two vessels have already been delivered, and arrangements arebeing made to load them.    Care has been taken to purchasehitherto only ships which have been actually running.(2)    CONDITIONS OF TRANSFER FROM UNITED STATES TO BRITISH FLAG,.The United States authorities have so far agreed to thetransfer of thirteen vessels (including the three smaller vessels on the list).    Ten are subject to the following conditions, whichit is expected will be generally applied to the ramainder of the purchases:-(i) The vessels are not to be employed for belligerentpurposes, that is, shall not during the present warbe converted into, or employed or commissioned as 1a vessel of war or Auxiliary Cruiser or Privateer.(ii) The vessels will be used principally for the carriage of cargo between the United States of America,(Atlantic and Gulf Ports) and Foreign Ports for the duration of the present war.

The first condition presents no difficulties.      Ihave informed my representative that the second condition can he accepted generally because of the latitude given by the word&quot;principally&quot;, but that he should ask for the stipulation tobe extended to include (a) any United States port including those on the Pacific Coast, and (b) if possible also Canadian and west Indian ports.      At the same time I have said that it willnot be advisable to press (b) if to do so is likely to endanger the transfer.      It will be quite possible to find full employment for the vessels we have bought, and indeed for a substantially greater number, within the trading limits laiddown.Transfer has also been approved of the three smallerships which it is intended to bring over for trading in thenear seas.      To these vessels the trading limits do not apply,(3).    FURTHER PURCHASES.My immediate aim is to increase our purchases to aboutfifty vessels in all, of which five should be especially suitablefor Liner service.      If it is not possible to obtain the requirednumbers of bulk carriers,  the number of Liner type vessels couldbe increased, without disadvantage.      But to complete this programme at an early date,  it is evident from Sir Ashley Spark.s&apos;latest reports that it will be necessary to give him somewhatwider latitude than hitherto, both as to the type of vessel, andalso as to price.(a)    Type of vessel.As regards type, it is principally a question of themachinery.     Shipowning opinion here has a strong preference forvessels with simple reciprocating engines as being economical toman, and more likely to be reliable in service, but the numberof such ships that it may he possible to purchase at any reasonable price is now very limited.      The other main type of vessel available has water tube boilers and turbines.      In ships

3-of the age we are buying, these are not attractive features, hutif the vessels have been well maintained, they should meet our requirements usefully, and accordingly Sir Ashley Sparks hasbeen authorised to buy such vessels in order to secure the required number of suitable ships, if he is satisfaed as totheir condition,(b)    Price.As regards price, the limit hitherto has been $I4.5 aton but as the market is rising, I have obtained Treasuryauthority to accord discretion to Sir Ashley Sparks to securethe best possible price up to $50 per deadweight ton providedthat in doing so he can obtain a block of ships.    It would notbe wise to advance our price to secure an odd vessel or two.Effort will be concentrated on acquiring ships which can bebrought into service in the next three months,(h)    FRENCH PURCHASES.The French Government have purchased six U.S. cargovessels for their own account.    Their total deadweight tonnage- is50,000.    The price paid was $us a ton, and the negotiations v/erecarried out by the French representative in close co-operationwith Sir A.Sparks.B.       PURCHASE OF TANKERS.The possibility of buying serviceable tankers from amongthe older vessels available in the U.S.A. is underconsideration.      One has been bought, at a price of $500,000,and two others are under offer.J.G.Ministry of Shipping,20th February, 191+0.
