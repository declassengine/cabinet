IllTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government&amp;ISITT - )jfjE C R E T.WAR CABINET.- THE COAL SITUATION.Report by the Lord Privx,.Sea 1.During February, acute difficulties arose in regardto the distribution of coal to London and the South ofEngland.     These difficulties were the result of a /prolonged period of severe weather, culminating in the complete stoppage of traffic during the week-end 27th/29th January,coming on top of the heavy reduction,  since the beginningof the war, in the volume of coal carried coastwise on theEast Coast.     Special meetings of the Ministers concerned were held on the 21st, 22nd and 27th February to considerthe position.      This Report records, for the informationof the War Cabinet,  the emergency measures taken to dealwith the situation.Intrqductqry.2. In normal times, two-thirds of the supplies of coalused by the Public Utility Undertakings in London and on theSouth Coast come by sea.     Even so3 rail and sea movementtogether cannot meet the full winter demand for coal in this area, and stocks accumulated during the spring and sumnermonths are eaten into during the winter.3. In most years stocks at the end of March are dovm toabout two or three weeks&apos; supply in the hands of PublicUtility Undertakings? and to less than a week&apos;s supply inmerchants&apos; yards.      In the spring of 1939, as in the previous year, big industries and merchants were advised by the MinesDepartment to build up stocks during the summer against thepossibility of war in the autumn.    In consequence, we started-1-COPY NO.&apos;5

the winter with exceptionally f^ood stocks at Public utility undertakings and large industrial concerns, while stocks inthe hands of merchants were also good.    Even at Christmas,when the weather began to impede transport, the stocks at allthese places were still good.4. During the first five months of war the total reductionin the amount of coal brought by sea to London and the south coast was 2,500,000 tons.     Efforts were made to divert intothe coastwise traffic shipping which would in normal timeshave gone on other voyages.      The measure of success attainedis shown by the fact that while the volume of East Coastshipping as a whole has been reduced by half, the amount ofcoal brought by sea has been about two-thirds of the pre-warsupply;    i.e.3 200,000 tons as against a pre-war figure of200,000 tons a week.&quot;   An average reduction of 100,000.tons -a.week in the amount carried by sea presents, however, a veryserious problem.5. Various steps were taken to increase the amount of coalcarried by rail.    Thus,  in October the Mines Department pressed the Public Utility Undertakings and industrial concerns topx\rchase coal from the Midlands and bring it to London by rail.An extensive programme of deliveries over several months was arranged, amounting in the aggregate to 800,000 tons.    The netadditional amount carried did not, however, amount to more than200,000 tons.6. Early in January a Special Committee, convened by LordHyndley, made provision for a further programme of specialtrains, rising gradually throughout the month to a total of16,200 tons a week, for Public Utility Undertakings.K These are average figures from the beginning of the war.They fluctuated   during the period, being much worse than this in December and January.

7. The interruption of traffic by weather throughoutJanuary, culminating in the complete hold-up during theweek-end of 27th/29th January, largely stultified these efforts and resulted in an acute shortage.      On the 29thJanuary a meeting was held under the Chairmanship of thePresident of the Board of Trade, and it was decided thatcoal in sidings should be requisitioned,  irrespective ofov/nership or quality.      Thirty trains standing in sidingswere requisitioned, and arrangements were made for the direct despatch of trains from collieries of about 70trains fur ther.8. On the 11th February a request had also been madeby the Secretary for Mines to the Minister of transport for absolute priority on the railways for coal for a fewdays.9. Further meetings took place on the 12th, 16th and17th February, at which the Minister of Shipping and theMinister of Transport were requested to arrange for additional transport by sea and rail to meet current consumption and build up stocks by the end of March.      Asa result, arrangements were made to provide trains fromthe Midlands and the North-East Coast to carry anadditional 71,500 tons of coal per week,  of which 20,000&apos; tons was for domestic purposes.     These arrangements couldnot, however, operate  jmmediately.      In the first place,they involved drastic alterations in the railway time-table,including severe reductions in psissenger services.Secondly, no progress could be made with the programme ofadditional trains until the congestion in the sidings hadbeen removed (See paragraph 14 below).      The Minister ofShipping undertook to find large ships for coal to amaximum of 25,000 tons during the next two or three weeks.A further loss of carrying capacity was, however, in

prospect as a result of the proposal to lay up thirtyships for arming.10.       At the Meetings of Ministers held on the 21st, 22ndand 27th February we considered measures of alleviationunder three heads:-(l) Drawing on accumulated stocks:(2) Measures to increase the amount of coalcarried by the railways:(3) The possibility of securing increased tonnage.Drawing on accumulated Stocks.11.       A special dump of coal, amounting to 320,000 tons,had been built up at Dagenham by the Central electricity board.     We agreed that this reserve should be drawn uponduring the emergency at the rate of 30,000 tons a week.This has enabled a number of trains, which would otherwise have been required to bring coal to London for PublicUtility Undertakings, to be used instead for the transportof domestic coal, amounting, as stated above, to 20,000tons a week.12.       We also considered whether the stocks of coal heldby the Railway Companies should be drawn on.      Specialinquiry showed that the stocks of locomotive coal and atrailway generating stations were less than four weeks&apos;, and rather over three weeks1 consumption respectively.     We came to the conclusion that this was one of the resources onwhich we could rely if the needs of the situation demandedit, but only as a last resort.13.       The suggestion was also made that the stocks of coalat Admiralty Dockyards were sufficiently high to enable theAdmiralty to release colliers for civilian purposes.      Oninvestigation we did not feel able to press this suggestion.The Admiralty have, however, teen able to give us some assistance in regard to shipping (See paragraph 20 below) .

Measures,^toit increase.....the,jambunt; of jcoa 1 carried by the14o       The most; urgent need was to relieve the extremecongestion in the colliery sidings and marshalling yards.Thousands of wagons ticketed for different destinationswere held up in the yards and could not he sent on until they had been sorted out according to destination0      it seemed probable that this would involve requisitioning thecoal contained in the trains and sending it to places wherethe shortage was greatest, regardless of the destinationsto which it was originally consigned.,15o       Immediately after our second meeting, on Thursday,22nd February, representatives of the Ministry of Transport,the Ministry of Shipping, the Mines Department and theRailway Executive Committee discussed this problem in detail with representatives of the Midland colliery owners.     they took as their objective the clearing of all colliery sidingsby the following Monday0     The representatives of therailways undertook tliat in the absence of fog or snow this objective would he substantially achieved, and the colliery owners were satisfied that the steps proposed would be effective in removing the congestion in the sidings so asto permit of a satisfactory outflow of coal from the collieries without having   recourse to requisitioning.16,       During&apos;the week-end 24th/26th February the railwayssucceeded in clearing practically the whole of theaccumulations at the Midland collieries without resort to requisitioning or direction of coal0     It should thereforenow be possible to make rapid progress with the programmeof additional trains from the Midlands and the North-SastCoast described in paragraph 9-,      In order to avoid unnecessary delays in making up trains at the collieries

and in their movement over the railways it has been necessary to adopt the principle of &quot;block-loading&quot;, or,in other words, of despatching full train loads to asingle destination,,     This involves some departure fromthe normal methods and channels of distribution, but ata time of great shortage of supplies the Lines Departmenthave been able to secure  this by arrangement with the collieries and consignees, both in the case of PublicUtility Undertakings and of household coal merchants.If this system could be more generally adopted over a longer period,  it would undoutedly lighten the task ofthe railv/ays in the distribution of our coal suppliesthroughout the country.,      Public Utility concerns and merchants would, however, have to change considerablytheir practice of distributing their orders for coalover numbers of different collieries.      The llinesDepartment are endeavouring to secure agreement to there-organisation of the method of distribution along theselines0      But the progress achieved must necessarily be gradual^17.       Two other steps have been taken to speed up themovement of coal on the railwayso      In the first place,it has been arranged that for a limited period all coal should continue to be accorded the same priority on therailways as is given to coal for Public Utility Undertakings,perishable foodstuffs and other urgent stores, including those for Navy, Military and Air Force establishments.Further,  at our request the Mines Department sent outofficials to act as &quot;wagon shepherds&quot;, that is to say,  to watch the flow of traffic at critical points on therailways in order to secure, so far as possible, thatcongestion shonld1  not occiir,

Measures for securing additional tonnage for the shipment of coal.18.        The A.dmiralty are naturally anxious to provide protection against air attack at the earliest possible date for themerchant seamen serving   on the East Coast route.     The most effective weapon for this purpose is the 12 pdr. gun.      Inorder, however, to reduce to a minimum   the time during whichships must be withdrawn for the purpose of arming, it has nowbeen agreed that the armament of vessls in the coastwise tradewith 12 pdr. guns shall be carried out, for the present,concurrently with docking or repairs, when the shipping would inany case have to be withdrawn from service;    machine-gons or Brenguns being supplied in the meantime.     Even this measure will reduce the amount of tonnage available by approximately 60,000tons a month, but we do not think that the delay involved could properly be reduced any further.19.       In order to secure that the fullest possible advantage istaken of the shipping available, instructions have been issuedby the Ministry of Shipping to all Area Committees to give first priority to the loading of coal for London and the South coast towns.     The Committees have also been instructed to holdemergency meetings and refuse approval to cargoes other than coalwherever    possible.     These arrangements, however, are not to affect the shipments of coal and pitch for the French MaritimeMission or vessels returning from France in ballast.20.       It was evident, however, that the requirements of thesituation could not be fully met unless further steps were takento provide additional coastwise shipping.     The MinesDepartment estimated that to meet current consumptionadditional shipping was needed, sufficient to securedeliveries of coal in London at the rate of 25,000 tons per week in excess of the present level, in addition to

making.good any reductions which may result from the steps3 taken for the arming of ships.      As a contribution tothe solution of this problem we invited the admiralty to consider, as a matter of urgency, the possibility of releasing, for the time being, colliers recently requi-sitioned, and of making available, if possible, a fewAdmiralty colliers or other suitable vessels.      in response to this request the Admiralty undertook to release for the time being two ships specially adapted for the London coal traffic which were recently requi-sitioned.     They have also agreed to release at once two small armament supply carriers of 200-1100 tons atpresent loaded with ammunition, and others will hesurrendered as fast as they can be spared,21.       Finally,  the Ministry of Shipping have under-taken to provide additional shipping to bring coal to London by the East Coast route.     Generally speakingit is undesirable to bring large ships to London, since this involves delay to the overseas programme, and also some risk in bringing vessels destined for overseasvoyages in and out of the Thames.       Arrangements have,however, been made to divert to the coastwise trafficseven large vessels which will together carry 25,000 tonsof coal per week, as well as five smaller vessels whichwill enable smaller shipments to be made to a number ofdestinations.Conclusions.22. The measures described above,  taken togetherwill enable additional supplies to be brought to Londonand the South Coast at the rate of 100,000 tons a week.Provided the weather remains good and no other abnormal

that it will he possible to get through the next few weekswithout further serious trouble, although as regards housecoal we shall necessarily have to live from hand tomouth for the time being.     With the end of March we shallpass into a less difficult period,    we shall then be ina position to frame a long-term policy, in order toprevent a recurrence of these difficulties, and to ensurethat adequate stocks are at hand by the beginning of next winter,,     We contemplate that the present rate ofadditional deliveries shall be maintained for a period ofat least two months, including additional deliveries for domestic purposes continued probably for three weeks.23. In order to assist us in working out a policy for the future,  the Ministry of Transport and the Secretaryfor Mines have undertaken to arrange for the collectionof more complete statistical information bearing on the coalposition.   Figures of stocks at Public Utility- undertakings and the larger industrial concerns are available, andin future particulars of stocks in the hands of merchants and a wider range of industries, as well as of thearrivals of coal in railway depots, will be regularlycollected.     With this additional information it shouldbe possible in future to keep a close watch on theposition in all its aspects.     One of the questions towhich we propose to give close attention in drawing up a policy for the future is the possibility of securing a further expansion in the output of coal, which hashitherto been restricted by the limitations of sea and rail transport.     It seems to us a paradox that unemployment should still persist in the mining industry at a time

when every country in the world is crying out for coal.The possibilities of such an increase in output are,of course, bound up with the expansion of our exporttrade, and we are considering whether the existing organisation for co-ordination of coal and shipping needsstrengthening.24. In conclusion, we wish to express our appreciation of the willing co-operation which has beenreceived from all the Departments concerned in dealingwith the emergency.     The Admiralty, the Ministry ofShipping,  the Ministry of Transport and the Mines Depart-ment have all played their part in meeting a serious situation.     Valuable help has also been given &quot;by theRailway Executive Committee and the colliery managements.2nd March, 1940,
