C L.        230WAR CABINET.THE. EFFECTS OP SEVERE, RATIONING.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.I circulate to the War Cabinet this report on an experiment in the effects of severe rationing, which I havereceived through Sir Edward Mellanby, Secretary of the medical research Council.    It will be seen that the experimentalration was more restricted in certain respects than thepresent German ration (Table l)nI would draw attention to the following points:-(a) If the consumption of food is cut down below acertain point in some articles of dietary, it willwill almost certainly increase in others, ifthey are available, possibly by more than the equivalent cut, so far as bulk is concerned,(b) The diet was founded on bread made of 92 per cent-extracted flour (i.e. nearly wholemeal),potatoes and green vegetables.    If bread ofthis kind is to be provided, arrangements must be made accordingly with the millers. -It would of course reduce the supply of offalsfor animal feeding stuffs.(c) The work., mental and physical, which thoseliving on this ration were able to do, showsthat the present German ration, provided itis in fact reaching the individual, is fully adequate for the vital needs of herpopulation0(intldo)    S.JPrivy Council Office,Whitehall, S.W.loSECRET.W.P.CG)(40)84.19TH MARCH.  1940.

2 d 3Investigation made for the Medical Research council a   REPORT    ONAN    EXPERIMENTAL    STUDY    OP    THE    EFFECTS    OF    SEVERE    RATIONINGby R.A. McCance and E.M. Widdowson,from the Department, of Medicine, Cambridge.The experiment described in this report was carriedout to discover the effects of subjecting normal English menand women to a regime in which flesh foods,  sugars, fats andother articles of diet were severely restricted.The, subjects.Four normal, healthy men and the same number ofwomen have taken part in this investigation.      Their agesranged from 21 to 70 years.      Four of them lived on the restricted diet for 3-g- months,    one for 2-g- months and the others for 2 to 4 weeks.The rations (see Table I).We decided that our consumption of meat, offal,poultry, bacon,  sausages and fish together should not exceed lb.  of edible raw material per person per week, and further,that not more than 2 oz.  of this amount should be bacon andnot more than 4 oz. fish.      Ihis allowance slightly exceeded the rationed meat of the German &quot;Normal Consumer.&quot;      It was much less than the amount allowed either to the German &quot;Heavy&quot;or &quot;Heaviest Worker.&quot;      Actually, however, the experimentalsubject was worse off than the German &quot;Normal Consumer,&quot; forin Germany fish, poultry, rabbits,  etc., are unrationed,whereas all these were included in the experimental meatallowance.      Since, moreover, in the later stages of the experiment our subjects were doing what amounted to very heavy work, their meat rations compared most unfavourably with those being issued in Germany to-day.We allowed ourselves 1 egg per person per week.Our ration of milk was     pint per person per day.This is half the present per caput consumption in this country.The present German rations include no fresh whole milk for adults, but skimmed milk is unrestricted.      Our ration of whole milk was approximately equivalent to 4lr oz. skimmed milkper day and bg- oz.  butter per week, greatly inferior to theGerman allowance of unlimited skimmed milk and Z\ oz.  of butter weekly.

We allowed 4 oz.  of margarine per person per week,no butter, and no fat for cooking other than the small amountsrendered out of the meat.      One subject ate no margarine atall for many weeks and another took considerably less than oz.      Thus,  fat was limited to a much greater extent  than itis in the German rations.      Even including the fat from thewhole milk,  the allowance for a &quot;Normal Consumer&quot; in germany is nearly double our ration, and that for the &quot;Heaviest Worker&quot;is nearly five times as much.The per caput consumption of cheese in the UnitedKingdom is of the order of 3 oz. per week,  of which about 1 oz.is home produced.      Cheese, however,  is one of the most valuable and concentrated foods which can &quot;be imported,  and aplentiful supply can probably be obtained from Canada.      Wetherefore decided to encourage its consumption and importationby fixing our allowance at 4 oz. per head per week.      TheGerman ration is I-f oz.We fixed the ration of sugar at 5 oz.  per person perweek.      One subject, however, ate none.      This sugar could betaken in tea or coffee,  or as the equivalent amount of jam,marmalade,  syrup or honey.      In Germany the weekly ration,including jam,  is 10-4- oz.We decided that if tonnage was very short it would beuneconomical to import fresh fruit.      We therefore limited our-selves to 6 oz.   (i.e.  2 apples)  of home grown fruit, usuallyapple, per person per week.      Home grown vegetables were allowed ad lib.   in season, but preference was always given tothose which can be grown upon a large scale.      Potatoes,cabbage, Brussels sprouts and greens were unrestricted.We decided at the outset that our health should notbe impaired by the experiment, and that therefore we must makethe diet physiologically adequate.      In order to do this it wasnecessary to leave some staple food unrationed in addition tothe potatoes and green vegetables.      We therefore assumed thatthere would &quot;be enough wheat available to cover the needs and demands of the population.      We used a flour which included92 per cent,  of the original wheat, for,  firstly,  in a crisisthe wheat must be made to feed as   many people as possible,and secondly the parts of the wheat usually removed in millingcontain substances of great value to persons living onrestricted diets.      The bread was baked &quot;with ordinary yeast,but with a special salt containing 10 per cent,  of chalk.This increased the amount of calcium in the diet withoutaffecting the  taste of the bread.There have been several broadcasts about rationing.In each the public has been reassured that there will be noscarcity of tea.      Propaganda about living conditions inGermany emphasises ad nauseam that tea and coffee are -unobtain-able and that even coffee substitutes are rationed.      Triflingthough their nutritive properties may be,  it is evident thatthese beverages have an immense psychological appeal,  and we decided that the Government1s policy would be to import them as long as it was humanly possible to do so.        We thereforedid not restrict them in our experimental diet.      We made thesame ruling about alcoholic drinks.

cS ?3Rations,  food and meals.It is one thing to prescribe rations;    it is quiteanother thing to convert them into meals,  and the first problem which confronted us was to find out whether it was possible,with the rations allowed,  to provide meals which were satisfyingand palatable to persons accustomed to a generous English diet.Our cooks easily solved this problem, although the shortage off at and sugar greatly restricted.the culinary possibilities opento them.      At first breakfast tended to he a dull meal of toastor bread with nothing on it,  or with the   merest scrape of margarine or jam.      We soon found out, however,  that reheatedvegetables made breakfast much more appetising.      The eveningmeal consisted usually of a single course.      It always contained the meat, fish or cheese portion for the day,  and potatoes andother vegetables were always provided.      The 4 oz.  of cheese aweek provided us with two tasty evening meals, and were verymuch more appreciated than another few ounces of meat would havebeen.      This was because a little cheese    was enough to make alarge dish of vegetables not only palatable but delicious.    Forthe same reason curry, sage, vinegar and spices proved them-selves to be very valuable adjuncts to a dietary such as ours,and we allowed all of them in moderation.We never got tired of the three staples, wholemealbread, potatoes and green vegetables, although some ate more of one than another.      Each was nutritionally very valuable and possibly indispensable.      During the tests of physicalendurance, when two of the subjects were eating up to 3 lbs.of bread a day, they had to eat large quantities of it dry.The&apos;extraordinary thing is that they did so with obviousenjoyment and relish.Adaptation and habit.Man is a conservative creature,  and perhaps more soover food than over anything else.      The sudden change fromnormal to experimental food forced us all to break a great many well-established habits.      We accepted the changes because we were prepared for them, but it took us some time to become fully adapted to the new regime.      By the end of three months,however, we had grown to like the food and we had most of usbecome so accustomed to it that we had no longing to go backto our pre-experimental dietary habits.      This is    not to saythat the flesh pots of Egypt had no attractions for us at all.One wanted more milk, for example, and another more fruit.Nevertheless we were at the end quite contented with our lotand asked for little better, and in proof of this it may beadded that none of the long-term subjects has yet completelyreverted to his pre-experimental dietary practices.One of the party never settled down under the regime.She was just as hungry for her meals as the others, and sheliked the food.      She was worried, however,  that she would getinfluenza in the spring if she did not eat fat;    that she would get some sort of obscure anaemia if she ate so little meat, andthat we should all feel the cold owing to the lack of fat andcalories in our diets.      She was apt to attribute perfectlynormal symptoms to the diet, and if they occurred in her fellowsubjects,  tried to make use of them to undermine  their morale.

She gave up the experiment after 2-g- months and went home for christmas.      We could see in this person just how a certainsection of the community would react in similar circumstances.She was therefore a valuable member of the party,  for if aneducated person with a scientific training reacts in this wayto restrictions which his teaching and rational senses shouldconvince him are harmless, then one can anticipate,  sympathise with and counter the reactions of the less well informed whofeel that any restriction in their diet is likely to be a menace to their health.Effects of the restrictions on the quantities of the differentfoods con sullied.Most of the subjects ate the whole of their rations,but in spite of making the most of their allowances in this waythe restrictions limited their consumption of these foods very considerably.      This meant that they were prevented from eatingfoods which had been providing them with a considerable pro-portion of their calories.      Fig.   1 illustrates how the subjects adapted themselves to the new situation.      Whendeprived of meat,  fat,  etc., their first reaction was to eatless total food.      This is shown by the fall in consumption ofcalories.      As they adapted to the changed conditions, however,they ate more and more of the unrationed foods (bread,  potatoesand green vegetables)  until they had regained their originalcalorie intake.      It is right that people should do this, andinteresting and important that they should do so naturally andinstinctively,  for a restricted calorie intake would rapidlylead to a general deterioration in the health and strength ofthe population.Chemical composition of the restricted diets.The restricted dietary compares very favourably witha normal one.      It contains fully as much total protein andmore of the important minerals,  calcium, phosphorus and iron.It is rich in vitamins A, B and C.      It is poor in animalprotein and fat but neither of these are thought to be important for the health of adults.      It is short of vitamin D,  but is no worse in this respect than the diets eaten by large numbers ofthe poorer classes in this country at the present time.Effects of the diet upon health and physical fitness.The general health of all the  subjects was goodthroughout the experiment.      They were able to carry out their normal work without any loss of efficiency.      After they hadbeen on the diet for three months, 4 of the subjects undertooksevere physical exercise.      This took the form of cycling longdistances under wintry conditions and walking and climbing inmountainous country.      For example,  one person cycled over100 miles    on December 23rd and two walked 36 miles,  including7,000 feet of ascent and descent on January 2nd.      These testswere  only incidents in a fortnight of considerable activity andthere is no doubt that on this food they were not only physic-ally fit and able to carry out severe and prolonged muscular

work, but they were mentally vigorous and anxious to make themost of what was to them an enjoyable holiday.Cost  of the diets.The foods used in this experiment were purchased inshops in Cambridge.      The average weekly cost of the food per head was seven shillings.      Of this,  31 per cent, was spent onvegetables,  including potatoes,  24 per cent,   on bread,  7 percent,  on milk and 38 per cent,  on the remainder of the diet.Pi scussion.Throughout this experiment we have had to listen tothe most gloomy statements about our present sanity and our future health.      Although most of these are quite too fantasticto mention, many of them were made by people in authority whohad either spent their lives working at nutrition or who hadreceived a special training in the subject.      Opinions such as these fully justify an experiment like this one at the presenttime,  for we have been able  to refute our critics on every point, and demonstrate, moreover, the bearing of such work onthe present national and international  situation.      Beforeenlarging on this point, however,  it is essential to realise that there are many differences between our artificialconditions and the real ones, which we ail hope may nevermaterialise.      We are fully alive to these differences    andhave made a careful study of them, but space prevents any dis-cussion of-them in this report.The first generalisation we wish to make is that  ifrationed in certain directions, people will certainly try tokeep up their calories from unrationed foods.      Hence,  partialrationing, i.e.  restrictions in the supplies of certain commodities, will not limit total consumption, as reckoned incalories.      It will rather direct consumption towards the foodswhich remain unrationed, and the demand for these will increase.Those responsible for the imposition of rations should be pre-pared for this.      Furthermore,  if the present quantitativedietary habits of an individual or of the nation .are known -and if the proposed restrictions are also known - then itshould be possible to make a forecast of what the increased consumption of the unrationed foods would be.      The more foodsit is proposed to ration,  i.e. restrict, the easier it becomesto make the forecast about the increased demand which will arise for the unrationed foods,      These statements are true ofany system of rationing.      Taking the present experiment as an example,  the restrictions imposed upon our consumption of meat,fats,  sugar,  etc.,  forced us to increase our consumption ofwheat and potatoes to 2-8 times,  and of green vegetables to 2-5times their previous levels.      If the restrictions of thepresent experiment were felt to be necessary over the whole country,- then the  Government should be prepared for the demandfor wheat, potatoes and vegetables to increase to about theseextents and act accordingly beforehand.      A more accurate fore-cast could probably be made if there was justification for doing so.

We have enjoyed the experimental diet and it hasmaintained us in good health, hut we do not think that at themoment the British people would readily accept it.      Therestrictions would be terrifying, for the public has not beenprepared psychologically to face a regime of this degree ofseverity.      We had an excellent example among our own subjects of how some of the population would undoubtedly behave if facedwith rations such as ours.      Nevertheless,  education andconfident reassurance based on facts can do much to remove mis-givings,  and if the public could once be persuaded to acceptrestrictions which were not prejudicial to health,  the powerof habit is so great where food is concerned that we do notbelieve there would be any further trouble.      In this theGermans have the advantage over us,  for their rations have been imposed and accepted,  and,  in our opinion, no complaints should now be anticipated in that quarter unless they are forced toreduce their rations and their physical nutrition begins to fail.      At present there is no suggestion of that so far as wehave been able to discover,  for we may neglect absolutely thestupid propaganda about German diets in the daily press.      we felt,  after a trial of three months,  that our restrictions were no hardship at all, and we fail to see why the German rations,which are much more generous than ours,  should be undermining the morale of a disciplined and determined nation.      If thiscountry is to face  severe restrictions,  the problem will be to effect their introduction and to get them accepted.      How itmight be done should be thought out now.We   would not recommend our diets as they stand,  forthey would be much improved by the addition of fat and sugar,but they have at least stood up to the test of experiment, andwe would strongly recommend certain features of them.      Thethree staples, wholemeal bread, potatoes and green vegetables,were all invaluable to us.      In a crisis, not only shouldeverything possible be done to leave them unrationed, but itshould be arranged that rich and poor can alike command them.For emergency rations,  only flour containing 92 per cent,  ofthe original wheat should be considered.      Nutritionally ourdiets would have been very inferior if we had used a 7G percent. - i.e. a white - flour.      We consider that if a milkshortage be envisaged at any time,  calcium should certainly beadded to the bread, and suggest that if there is to be anyshortage  of flesh foods,  or indeed in any case, the importationand consumption of cheese should be encouraged.We would draw attention to the value of experimentssuch as the present one in planning relief diets for starvingpopulations.      We also feel that these experiments should nowbe extended to children.      It might be of immense value sometime in the next few years if we could prescribe with confidencevery simple diets which children and adults could reasonably beexpected to eat, which would maintain perfect health and whichit was within the country&apos;s means to provide.The  success with which we have been able to carry outsevere physical work in very cold weather raises the questionwhether diets such as ours would not be quite as  satisfactoryfor soldiers as their present ones.      We believe they would,but again we would not Pdvocate them without modification,  andpreferably not without trial.      We can see no justification,however,  for the enormous amounts of meat in the rations of theBritish soldier,  and we consider that troops,   in this country

at any rate, would be  just as well served with bread made fromlightly milled flour, more potatoes if necessary,  and less meat.One experiment can never settle every question.&quot;While,  therefore,  in the meantime we make our deductions and suggestions with reserve, we feel that we have established one point with certainty, namely that these problems of nationalnutrition in times of stress can be tackled by experimentalmethods.      We do not expect our studies to have provided us with more than a first approximation of the truth.      Otherexperiments, however,  can easily be designed to cover,  to check,and so to confirm or refute  every statement we have made.Summary.1.      Normal English men and women have lived for 3-g- monthson diets which were much more restricted in meat, fats and sugarthan the present German ones.2.      Their three staple and unrationed foods were wholemealbread, potatoes and green vegetables, and their consumption ofthese rose to 2-8 times their previous levels.3.      At.the end of the experimental period they displayedthe fullest bodily and mental vigour and had become s3accustomed to the food that they had no longing to go back to more conventional fare.4.      The implications of these results are discussed andcertain recommendations made.
