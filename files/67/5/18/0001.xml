Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1941).SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 68.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.YvAR CABINET.ANGLO-ITALIAN  ECONOMIC  RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the attached paper on Anglo-Italianeconomic relations, which has been prepared in consultation with the otherDepartments concerned, since they may wish to be kept generally informed onthis question. No immediate decisions are called for. though I should be glad toreceive approval of the general line suggested.The most important point is the sale of British coal to Italy (see paragraphs 3. 4 and 5). As my colleagues will recollect, the Italian Governmenthave already been informed that German seaborne exports of coal to Italy will be subjected to our control from the 1st March and that special facilities will beavailable to cover the import of British coal to Italy during the month of March.As appears from paragraph 5 of the attached paper. I think we shall do well to defer any final decision on our future policy in regard to the provision of furtherfacilities for the sale of coal to Italy until the position generally is a little clearer.I would suggest, therefore, that the matter be reconsidered in, say, a fortnightstime, and that meanwhile our policy should be as suggested in the final paragraphof the attached paper.H.Foreign Office, March 1, 1940.ANGLO-ITALIAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS.THE Master of the Rolls has now returned from Rome and has presented areport on the negotiations with the Italian Government. Stated in the verybriefest terms the position is that we had hoped to be able to place in Italy ordersfor various goods amounting in all to possibly as much as  23,000,000, of which about  14,000.000 was for armaments, and to charter Italian ships at a gross costof about  5,000,000 per annum. At the same time we should have been ready toaccept an Italian State guarantee against re-export as sufficient for purposes of contraband control, and we were willing, in the last resort, to buy or make marketfacilities available for Italian agricultural produce up to a total not exceeding 5,000,000. We were also ready to supply Italy with coal at the rate of about,000,000 tons a year, which should have been sufficient for her purposes ifsupplemented by reasonable deliveries from Germany by rail.10912   [20913]
2. Sigrior Mussolini has upset this comprehensive scheme by deciding thathe will not at present supply us with armaments. This means that the proceeds of Italian sales to us will probably amount to some figure between  7,000,000 and 9,000,000 in the current year. In addition, Italy may receive some sterling from her sales to France (probably about  2,000,000) and about  2,000,000 from us ifthe shipping agreement goes through. Out of these receipts, Italy might be ableto pay for the full 8,000,000 tons of coal she needs this year, though this would leave little or no margin for the purchase of any United Kingdom goods otherthan coal and Newfoundland fish or of any raw materials in the sterling area,and Italy would find it difficult to make purchases of such raw materials else-where : such a situation would be equally unsatisfactory to us. as the reductionof Italian purchases of United Kingdom&apos;goods (other than coal) and Newfound-land fish below the present level of about  2.250,000 would obviously have aserious effect on various lines of British export trade, and provision must also bemade for the payment by Italy of about  600.000 in respect of financial debts.On the other hand, Italy could maintain the present level of her other purchases in the United Kingdom and still be able to buy about 4.000,000 tons of coal.While it is primarily for Italy herself to decide how she is to deal with the resulting situation, there are certain points on which decisions must be taken at this end.German Coal.3. The War Cabinet decided on the 19th February (46 (40)) that, unlessHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome saw serious objection, ships carrying coal from Germany and leaving port after the 1st March should be subject to export control. Sir P. Loraine in his telegram Xo. 136 agreed that the 1st Marchwas a reasonable date, and instructions have accordingly been sent to him to notify the Italian Government in the above sense.United Kingdom Coal in March.4. Sir P. Loraine has stressed the great importance of ensuring that suppliesof British coal are not immediately reduced or interrupted altogether as a resultof the increasing delay in payment likely to follow the breakdown of the negotia-tions. This question was considered at an inter-departmental conference, atwhich it was felt that Sir P. Loraine?s view was fully justified, and arrangements have been made for the Export Credits Guarantee Department to givecl political &quot; guarantees in order to ensure that there will be available for italy as much coal as she can lift with her own ships and any British ships that maybe made available under the shipping agreement during the month of March.Sir P. Loraine has been authorised to explain the position in general terms to count Ciano, but has teen warned that he should not give Count Ciano theimpression that such special facilities can be extended beyond the end of March.United Kingdom Coal after March.5.   A decision will have to be taken in good time on the policy to be followedafter March.   If we were to continue these i; political &apos;&quot;&apos; guarantees for a largeramount of coal than Italy can pay for through the Clearing, the arrears in the clearing would increase, and eventually we should have to find the moneyourselves with small prospect of being repaid.   Thus we can either hold coal supplies to Italy strictly to the level of what she can pay for through the Clearingor alternatively we can allow the coal account to fall further into arrears and thereby in effect give Italy a credit,   It is submitted that in the absence of anychange of heart on the Italian side we should adopt the first policy. i.e., supplyonly what Italy can pay for.   It does not follow that the special facilitiesarranged for the month of March should be withdrawn entirely thereafter.Payments through the Clearing for coal exports to Italy at present take about two months, owing to the existing arrears in the coal account.   The coal exportersare at present prepared to accept this delay, because they are covered by facilities offered through the Export Credits Guarantee Department.   As things stand atpresent, the delay in payment is almost certain to increase, and if at the sametime credit facilities were withdrawn, the coal exporters would not be preparedto accept the situation, and would try to reduce their outstanding risks by slowing down shipments to a rate which would enable the arrears in the Clearing to be
overtaken. This would almost certainly lead temporarily to a very drastic reduction of coal exports to Italy, which would have serious effects on Italy&apos;economy. The exact course to follow can best be decided in the light of thecircumstances prevailing at the time. If it becomes clear that continued coalshipments on the existing scale will lead to increasing delay in payment, it maybe desirable to limit our guarantee to such smaller amounts as are likely to bepaid for without overloading the Clearing.(&apos;)General Purchases in Italy.6. At the interdepartmental meeting referred to above it, was suggestedthat outstanding negotiations for purchases in Italy should be pursued and thatthe general principle should be that we should buy in Italy whenever we canconveniently do so.A g ri cultural Produce.7. Our tentative and conditional offer to make special purchases of Italianagricultural produce must now be regarded as withdrawn. This should not preclude us from buying such agricultural produce as it is in our interest to buy in italy and there would, of course, be considerable political advantage in doing so.Shipping.8. In the course of a conversation which the Master of the Rolls had withthe Italian authorities on the 12th February it was stated that it would be possibleto arrange for us to charter Italian vessels bound for the United Kingdom to fetchcoal to carry goods not classified as contraband in The Hague Convention,&quot;&apos; bywhich the Italian authorities probably have in mind the Declaration of London ofthe 26th February, 1909. An arrangement on these lines might be acceptable to ussince the contraband list in this declaration is restricted.A telegram has been sent to Rome to ascertain whether the Italians areprepared to commit themselves to this. If they are, it would seem that they have abandoned their objection to carrying sulphur and iron-ore, which would be a, very important advance from our point of view.If the Italians are prepared to proceed on these lines, it is submitted thatthe negotiations should be completed and the arrangements brought into operation as soon as possible without waiting for a general settlement, since the assistance that would thus be available to us from Italian shipping would he of the utmostvalue and is urgently reqiiired.As regards payments for freight, it is clear that we are now in a stronger position than we were when there was still a prospect that the Clearing wouldbalance without them. It is submitted that every effort should be made to provide that the freights, or at the least the net payments in respect of them, should bepaid into the Clearing or into a special account for purchases in the sterling area.(&apos; lea ring A greement.9. There are various questions outstanding in the negotiation of the newClearing Agreement which can only be settled after the major questions of policy have been decided and the attitude of Italy has been clarified.Contraband Control.10. The Italian proposal for a State guarantee against re-export of goodspassed through our control raised certain difficulties, and, as the general scheme has fallen through, it would seem best for the present to continue the existing system, which docs not appear to be giving rise to any particular friction.Conclusion.11. The reasons which may have led Signor Mussolini to adopt his present attitude almost certainly include strong pressure from Germany and probablyfrom his own Service Departments. The effect, as stated above, is to subjectItalian economy to a very severe strain and the arrangements which we have(*) In considering this question it. should be noted that failure to ship under contractsalready made (amounting to about 5,300,000 tons) would in some cases involve a breach of contract, notwithstanding Italian inability to pay in sterling.
made to deal with. Italian coal purchases from this country will give Italy abreathing space until the end of March in which to reconsider her position. Atthe end of that time Italy must either find means of financing her essential imports whether by sales of armaments or payments in free exchange, or eiseresign herself to a restriction of imports of a severity which may not inconceivablybring Italian industry almost to a standstill. That Signer Mussolini should have allowed us to carry on negotiations with the various Italian companies and authorities al! to no purpose will not have worked entirely to our disadvantage,since it will have demonstrated to a large number of persons in Italy that weare willing and even anxious to buy Italian produce if only we are allowed to.We have made Italy a very tempting offer and we cannot at the moment do anything further to extricate her from the difficulties in which Signor Mussolini&quot;decision has placed her.It is submitted that in dealing with economic and contraband questions our attitude should continue to be as friendly and helpful as possible short of nowgiving the impression that we are prepared to make any further concessionswithout some substantial quid pro quo.Foreign Offwe, March 1, 1940.
