(&amp;) (40) 92.Lt. April; 1940i-WAR CABINET.BROADCASTING DURING DAYLIGHT TO GERMANY AND OTHERCQTJNTRIES OF EUROPE.Note by the Minister of Information.1. War Cabinet approval is sought for the erection of a broadcastingstation near the East coast, to provide long-range d&amp;ylight service to Western and Central Europe on long wave or medium wave.2. England already broadcasts to all Europe on short waves;but few listeners have short-wave receivers.   The medium-waveservice has a limited daylight range, extending only to thenorth-v/est of Germany.   Its range increases after dark; but during about half the year the peak listening time - round 9 p.m. -involves a daylight service, and in summer - when darkness begins in.this country between 1 and 9.JO G.M.T. (between 9 and 11.30 Mid-European summer time) - broadcasts on medium wave are ineffectiveto the greater part of Germany and of Europe.3. Germany, with the advantage of central position, hastransmitters v/hich give good daylight services to listenersin neutral countries.   She acquired some in Austria, Czecho-Slovakiaand Polandj and before the outbreak of war she erected secretlya high-power transmitter on the coast near the Dutch frontierwhich is now giving daylight broadcasts to this country.A, In the course of the war, or at the time of an armistice,it may be of vital importance that England should &quot;be able to broadcast to as many listeners as possible in Germany and elsewhere in Europe at any hour.     This will only be possible by the erection of the transmitter now recommended.- -. - iCopy No.       X ti

The matter has been examined by an inter-departmentaloommittee; and experts are agreed that daylight service canonly be given by the erection of a station of very highpower (800 kilo-watts) near the East coast.   It will takeabout 14 months and cost about  300,000.     Running oostsfor six hours daily will be about  50,000 per annum.The effect would be lost unless it were operatedalone, without synchronisation to spoil the beacon effect.Consequently it could be used for direction-finding byhostile aircraft.     Therefore though immediate authorityto order the transmitter is sought, it would not be broughtinto use till the Secretary of State for Air was satisfiedthat the risks attributable to this navigational aid haddiminished.   Otherwise it would not operate duringhostilities unless the Government decided that propagandaneeds were of over-riding importance.The Air Staff may feel that the existence of such astation might prove a standing temptation to disregard thenavigational risks in favour of propaganda.      But theMinistry of Information will not raise the question without consultation with the Secretary of State for Air.To be of maximum use, especially in the medium waveband, the station should be equipped with masts 500 feethigh.   Unfortunately this would be dangerous for flyingand if the Secretary of State for Air objects to mastsmore than 350 feet high , this could be accected, thoughthe effect would be considerably to lessen the range.This question might be left for settlement when the siteis known.

On these conditions permission is asked to authorisethe B.B.C. to obtain site and transmitter.   The matter is ofgreat urgency and such priority is requested as will ensurecompletion by midsummer 1941*A memorandum drawn up by the interested Departments(Foreign Office, Air Ministry, Post Office, Wireless Boardand Ministry of Information) is attached;    the considerationsat issue are set out in greater detail.Initialled    J.O.W.R.

9 P appendix.SECRET.BROADCASTING DURING DAYLIGHT TO GEBIANY AND OTHERICOUNTRIES OP EUROPE,Memorandum by the Inter-departmental Committee on additional Wireless Transmitters.1. A proposal to improve the daylight range of the news bulletinsAgreedStatement,    and talks broadcast in foreign languages from the United Kongdemto Germany and other Continental countries has been examined and discussed by the Committee.     Complete agreement upon the adoption of theproposal has not been reached; but this memorandum is approved by all departments concerned as a statement of the problem and of the technicalfactors involved.2. The B. B. C. service to Germany is generally recognised as one of. B. C,service        the most important weapons in this war - indeed as one thatto Europe,and its      - ranks, with other instruments of propaganda, as an indispensablelimitations.ally of the three fighting services.     In Germany, however,listening to foreign broadcasting is illegal, and a listener who tunes in toa British station does so at his peril, although there is reason to believethat a considerable number of German listeners do in fact take this risk.The B. B.C. services to other European countries are intended to carry outthe important function of presenting the British Case to those countries andcounteracting German propaganda addressed to them.     These services areavailable on short waves to Continental listeners;   but the existing medium-wave service has a very small daylight range.3. To the natural advantage of their central position the GermansAdvantagesheld by        have added the provision of numerous stations in Germany properGermany.and the acquisition of stations - together v/ith the wave-lenthsassigned to them by international agreement - in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and poland.     The German stations include a transmitter near the western frontierideally placed for broadcasting to Great Britain which was planned secretlyand partially constructed before the war and is now &quot;broadcasting in English

on high power.     For geographical reasons it is impossible for us to attain equality v/ith Germany in this sphere; but the present inequalityduring hours of daylight is harmful to British interests, medium orlong v/avo broadcasts from one station or another under German controlbeing audible at times practically throughout Europe, whereas Britishmedium-wave broadcasts are not audible by daylight to ordinarylisteners abroad beyond Belgium, Holland, the nearer parts of Franceaand the extreme north-west of Germany,      The purpose of the present proposal is to do what is practicable to reduce this inequality to amore tolerable level, by enabling as many as possible- of theContinental listeners equipped only v/ith medium-v/ave receivers, to hearnews from this country during daylight if and when existing restrictions(based on considerations of defence) can be modified,4. As a result of decisions taken during the planning stage orStepsalready        shortly after the outbreak of war, adequate reinforcementsdecidedupon. for the short-wave service are in hand, the medium-waveservice has been augmented by the addition of a150 kilowatt transmitter with a newly-designed aerial complying with defence requirements but effective only after dark, and a transmitter of very high power (800 kilowatts) but v/ith the same limitations is beingerected at Broitwich.     The Departments concerned are agreed thatduring the winter months the hours of darkness are most important forbroadcast listening and that these steps will afford the maximumimprovement practicable v/ithin the limitations at present imposed inthe interests of defence. ,5. The great bulk of broadcast listening is concentrated in theImportanceOf daylight evening, from 7 to 9 or 10 p.m.  (local time).     These hoursservice.in Mid-European summer time are equivalent to the hours from5 to 7 or 8 p.m. Greenwich mean time, and thus fall almost entirelyv/ithin the period of daylight in England during the summer months.     Ineffect, during about half the year little or nothing can be heard fromthis country (except on short waves) until the peak hours of listeningare over - in midsummer, until after 10,30,      This is a severe handicap

to our propaganda and publicity, whether addressed to countries under german rule or to neutrals.     Unless a remedy for this, difficulty can befound and applied, it cannot be expected that Continental listeners(apart from those possessing short-wave sets) will hear the British caseor the presentation of British views during the summer half of the year.Tho Foreign Office, the Ministry of Information and the B.B.C. thereforeattach great importance to a large improvement in our daylight coverage.6* In the circumstances of the moment the Department&apos;s concernedConditions ,in which      do not question that defence considerations are paramount,broadcastpropaganda   But as the war develops many contingencies are possible inmay be ,vital. which the effect of broadcasting upon general opinion abroadmay become an essential need.     For example, it may become possible to discount the Capacity of the German Air Force to penetrateour defences, while in other respects a condition of stalemate prevailsbetween the opposing forces; or new scientific discoveries may have made it possible to disregard the use of broadcasting transmissions as an aid to air navigation; or in a pre-armistice period there may be a nearprospect of breakdown in enemy moral, or there may be a danger of spreadingBolshevism; or during an armistice great importance may be attached to theexpounding of British and allied aims to the enemy peoples and to neutrals;and finally, though it is hard to forsee at this stage the nature of a future peace, it would be unwise to assume that in peacetime the voice ofGreat Britain will not need to be strongly heard in European broadcastingduring daylight hours.7. The experts of the interested Departments are agreed that theMethod ofproviding     only means of affording effective service by daylight to largedaylightservice.       and densely populated parts of Germany and to several othercountries is the erection near the Suffolk coast of an800 - kilowatt transmitter at an estimated cost of  280,000 including sitebut excluding overhead expenses.     The transmitter should be designed towork optionally in the medium or in the long wave-band.     Aerials of about

350 feet in height would serve tolerably well for long-wave working, but a.greater height, if permissible, would give a better range on a medium wave.If the Secretary of State for Air considered that masts exceeding 350 feetin height on a site near the coast would constitute too dangerous an obstacle to our own aircraft, the advocates of the scheme, thoughreluctant to forego the optimum range of the station  would recommend theconstruction of the station with this limitation.The effective daylight service area would be expected toinclude at least Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Switzerland, a large part of western and Central Germany (including Berlin) and of Prance, and thenearer parts of Norway and Sweden.     We may find that the station will be heard, even in daylight, beyond these distances,8. The experts are also agreed that the station should be operatedConditionsof without synchronised &quot;spoilers&quot; and would therefore serveoperation.hostile aircraft as a beacon - not the only means of navigation,but at the present stage of development an important aid in some weather conditions,     It would therefore be inadvisable to operate the station whilethe strategic and scientific positions remain unchanged.      It is thereforean agreed recommendation that the station, if erected, should not be allowedto begin transmitting until either the Secretary of State for Air is satisfied that the danger to air security has grown less or the Governmenton a further review of the ,position has decided that propaganda needs must take precedence.9. It is expected to take fourteen months to obtain a site, buildUrgencyof the station, and manufacture and erect the equipment and aerials,decision.If therefore the station is to be ready for possible use in the summer of 1941, an immediate decision is required.     A sufficiently high degree of priority should be accorded to secure completion by midsummer 1941.10, There are certain difficulties and objections which have to beLongwave-length, met.     One of these is the fact that the long wave allocated toGreat Britain is adjacent to that of Deutsohlandsender, so thatsome doubt arises as to its effective reception, particularly in Germany,

A remedy would be to shift the wavelength slightly away from that ofthe German station towards the wavelength on the other side, which isshared between Reykjavik (Iceland) and Minsk (U.S.S.R.),     These twoAdministrations might consider themselves entitled to protest against such, a departure from the International Wavelength Planj   but othercountries have in the past failed to observe strictly the agreedallocations in the long wave band.      These is a possibility of interference vd.th reception in Iceland;   and Minsk, though at a long distance, might be somewhat effected.     The shifting of the Britishwave might of course be neutralised by changes in other countries.These points, however, are not considered to be of such moment as to override a war time necessity,,11* It has been suggested that if the war became primarily a risk ofjamming.      war of propaganda, an increase of jamming would surelyensue, and the expenditure on this scheme would be renderedfruitless unless the transmitter itself were used for reprisals.During this war, as in 191^-1918, jamming has for the most part been avoided by both sides, and there is no present sign of an abandonment ofthis policy.     We should stultify ourselves and make the enemy1s taskmuch easier if we allowed him to build up a position of superiority inthe broadcasting sphere and took no corresponding action because of therisk of possible interference on his part.12. It has been represented that a station on the East CoastVulnerabilitywould be in the most exposed position and an obvious mark forair attack.     On the other hand the recommendation is that the stations should be placed about ten miles inland where it will be no worsedefended than many existing wireless stations and other points of vitalimportance in this country and in Germany.     In such a position it willbe less conspicuous than on the coast itself.     Such a station could not easily be completely destroyed.     No other position would givesatisfactory results,  and the risk of attack cannot well be avoidedthough no doubt the buildings would to some extent be disguised.

13* The cost - in the neighbourhood of  300,000 - ia undoubtedlyCost.high;   but it is the oost of a station of exceptionally high power.     The Germans have not allowed themselves to be discouragedfrom extensive broadcasting activity in many languages and to all partsof the world by considerations of cost.     The expenditure is to beregarded as an insurance premium against being altogether outdistanced byGermany if condition should arise in which the suggested station could safely be used at a time when public opinion abroad had become a factor of prime importance.     The premium would be regained if a satisfactorypeace were brought nearer by a single day.     The Ministry ofInformation and the Foreign Office would give this scheme a high placein the priority list for propaganda expenditure.1A. The peace-time value of the station has been questioned.Peace-timevalue. It is true that the position, is not one which would be chosen for purposes of the home broadcasting service.     But it is hard to imagine that in the conditions which may be supposed to exist afterthe war, the need for a broadcast service of this kind to foreigncountries will come to an end;   and even if that should be so the bulkof the expense is for apparatus which could be removed and usedelsewhere.15. The scheme offers an incidental but very important advantageAdditionalChannel        in that the high-power channel which it provides will beat night.available after dark to serve as a supplement or alternativefor existing channels.      For this purpose the transmitter could be usedwith a horizontal aerial (avoiding direction-finding emissions) in thesame manner as the 800 - kilowatt transmitter now under construction at-Xtcoitwich.     Nevertheless it is the agreed view of the Committee thatthe justification of the scheme and its main value must be found in theprovision for long-range daylight service which is not attainable by anyOther means.Ministry of Information,Malet Street,     W.C.1.1st April,, 1940.
