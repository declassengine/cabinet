SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 74..March 11, 1940.WAR CABINET.CONGRESS AND THE WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.WITH reference to my Memorandum dated the 11th March,No. W.P. (G.) (40) 73, I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet copiesof two notes which I have received from the Viceroy, giving full accounts of hisinterviews with Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah at the beginning of February. Theseare relevant to an appreciation of the general political situation in India.India Office. Z.Note of a Conversation between His Excellency The Viceroy and Mr. M. K.Gandhi at The Viceroy&apos;s House, New Delhi, on Monday, February 5,1940.Mr. GANDHI opened the conversation by saying that while he could stayhere till 11th February, he did not want to do so if it could be avoided, andthat he was anxious to get off as soon as possible. After the usual complimentsI asked him whether he had seen Sikander. He replied that he had done so,and that the conversation had ranged over various matters and had been friendly.This represented a resumption of touch and a preliminary approach after the months that had elapsed since he had last seen Sikander. As for Mr. Jinnah,his reaction to Mr. Gandhi&apos;s approach of a few weeks back had come as a shock to Mr. Gandhi and had been entirely unexpected. In view of his generalintransigence Mr. Gandhi felt that he had no meeting ground whatever withhim.2. I said that I dared say that Sir Sikander had mentioned to Mr. Gandhithe Muslim intention of undertaking propaganda at Home, and that perhaps hewas aware that the Princes also were likely to combine in this. Mr. Gandhireplied that he realised that, and that he could indeed claim to have appreciated the alliance between the Princes and the Muslims in this matter even earlier than I had myself. He had sensed it at Rajkot, and had realised also that thefinance of this business was coming from the Princes. On all that let him make his position clear. He came to see me to-day not merely without the agreementof his colleagues, but despite the efforts which they had made to prevent him from doing so. He was alone, throwing himself on the mercy of God. his friends were indeed profoundly uneasy. Vallabhbhai Patel had sent him a letter which he opened only in the car as he came along, in which he begged him togive nothing away at his interview with me.3. Mr. Gandhi proceeded that he had communicated what he intended tosay to me in a short time to Rajendra Prasad alone, and that he alone was aware of it. He had undertaken to Rajendra Prasad to make his approachpurely exploratory and to come to no final conclusion or agreement. Neitherwas possible without consultation with the Working Committee.   He had told191Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1940.
them that he would come in his own name, but that they must recognise that,with his status, he must not be checked in his impulse to come and see the ViceroyHe was coming to see me because he felt that if I, under instructions from theCabinet, was in a position truly to reflect current British opinion, there was a chance of a settlement honourable to all, which might make it possible for indians to feel about the Commonwealth as the British felt. His friends rejected thepossibility, but he still had hopes, or rather faith. He recognised that this mightbe a dream which would not come true. As for the Princes, let them spend theirwealth on propaganda. Sooner or later they would dig their own grave. the muslim League, when the crisis came, would not receive the support of the mass of the Muslim population. He, Mr. Gandhi, could still stir those masses^ Theyhad not forgotten his actions and his attitude during the Khilafat agitation.Even in Tribal Areas or among the Moplahs he had support, and he was preparedto go unprotected amongst both, whether amongst the Moplahs or into the TribalAreas of the North-West Frontier Province. It is true that there were somewho claimed that they sought to kill him, and he was well aware that there wasa Khaksar list of five, of which he was No. 1. But he slept peacefully in the open at Wardha. He had no guards or protection inside the Ashram. what happened outside was the business of the Government of the Central Provinceswhich he could not control. The turbulent forces of the Left listened to hisvoice, because alone and by themselves they were impotent, and they realised thatthe issue of peace or war was in his hands. Yet the Working Committee had not given him a blank cheque so far as negotiations were concerned. Of this he didnot complain. It was right that no one man should be in a position to giveaway anything of the national cause.4. As he came to examine the prospects of reaching a settlement or the reverse, he bad no anxiety. Vallabhbhai Patel had wanted to accompany himon his visit lest he should require support. He had preferred to come alone.If indeed carnage must come, he would look on without flinching, though he himself was a man of non-violence. He hoped that he might have strength to sacrifice himself along with his friends. It was true that non-violence inexperience had not come up to his expectations. That was due to the weakness of human nature. His supporters in the various groups were all begging him to declare war and crying out that they could do nothing unless he was preparedboth to commence hostilities and to lead them. But he had so far refused to declare war unless they gave him their hearts, and their complete obedience tothe principles of non-violence. What mattered to him was that he should obtain a settlement which by its repercussions should raise the moral stature of India.At this stage, in his judgment, it was better to have nothing than a makeshift.5. The Mussalmans and the Princes might disturb the Viceroy and confuseissues for a while by propaganda activities in Great Britain. If invited by usto do so, despite his age, he himself would do his personal best to appeal to british public opinion.6. At this stage I told Mr. Gandhi that I noticed that he proposed to speak for himself only and that he was unable to commit his friends. Iquite understood the circumstances in which on this occasion he was debarred from speaking for the Working Committee. He must realise, however, thatit would not be possible, assuming that a preliminary enquiry showed thatwe could usefully proceed with conversations, for me to continue to dobusiness on that basis. It was essential that he should be in a position to speak for, and commit, the Congress as such. He had mentioned his age.Neither I nor His Majesty&apos;s Government overlooked that factor, or the limita-tions that it inevitably placed on his opportunities. But I thought it only right to tell him that many of us felt very strongly that if a good issue wasto come out of negotiations, it would be essential that he should not merelyinitiate, but that he should concern himself directly with implementing, any agreement that might be arrived at. His prestige, I thought, had never beenhigher. As he was aw^are, I myself had found Jawaharlal Nehru attractive :but that gentleman now as Chairman of the War Committee of Congress hadneither the experience of public affairs, the steadiness of vision, or the controlof his own utterance which Mr. Gandhi possessed. If any real advance wasto be made, it was quite essential in my judgment that Mr. Gandhi, while
taking his colleagues with him, should himself direct and maintain controlover the activities of Congress. Indeed!, speaking for myself personally I could hardly contemplate accepting responsibility for my share of any agreement unless could rely on a firm assurance from him of his personal direction of congress and his comfort and support for myself..7. Mr. Gandhi in reply stated that he unequivocally undertook to give me his constant support. He himself, he might tell me, was, he thought, ina very strong position at the moment. The more difficult and combative elements in Congress felt that they could not dispense with his Generalship. As hehad told me, he would not flinch if he thought the moment had come for givingthe word. Meanwhile he could assure me that he was in no hurry to declare war. If I thought it derogatory to the Viceroy&apos;s dignity or the prestige ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to confer on him power to put through a settlement,we had only to say so, and he would not complain. But that indeed was thesurest way to get the business put through. Would I care to hear his iews about the general question of a settlement ?8. I replied that I should certainly be very glad to hear his views. Witha less experienced negotiator I might have felt that it would be more conducive toa successful outcome, if my offer which might conceivably be short of his require-ments came first. In his case I knew that he would not allow any sharpnessof contrast between our positions to prejudice the chances of an understanding.J would like to put him in possession of my mind on one or two aspects ofthe case as I saw it. The task ahead might be divided into two parts. Onthe one hand, we were both concerned to satisfy what I might call the spiritualaspect of the Indian demand. On the other hand, we had to contemplate machinery to deal with the practical work-a-day problems. Thus, for example, to takethe matter of defence, defence was a subject which could not easily be dealtwith in time of war. No one knew how India and how Great Britain would stand at the close of hostilities. The subject was a vast and complicated one,in which with the best will in the world it was inconceivable that an arrange-ment to deal with it could be given practical shape without prolonged! analysisand negotiations.9. Mr. Gandhi, who had evidently misunderstood a little the purport ofmy remarks, answered that he was of opinion that while the war lasted theBritish word should be final in military policy : but that even during the periodof war, no secrecy as between Indian and English colleagues was justified.(I imagine he was thinking of an expanded! Executive Council.) If IndianMembers or Ministers could not be trusted to keep official secrets despite theiroath of secrecy, and the responsibility attaching to a share in administration,they must be traitors and would deserve to be ejected. Surety it would! be better to assume that they would be loyal and to trust them.10. I replied that I quite understood, and shared, his view. I had, inthe remarks I had addressed to him, concentrated more on the constitutionalaspect of defence and its control than on the conduct of military operations in time of war.11. On the general issue of the future Indian constitution, Mr. Gandhithen said that His Majesty&apos;s Government ought to allow India to decide forherself. We could out of our wealth of experience make plain to India the risks which she would be running by adopting any particular course, but weshould say that if, now that she was aware of those possible risks, she wishedto take them, then she was at liberty to do so. That was consistent withthe method of building a new constitution by a Constituent Assembly in whichall interests were adequately represented. It was reasonable to assume thatno recommendation would , be made by such a body which did not take full account of every relevant circumstance.The Princes.12. As for the Princes, they were not to be regarded, in their collectivecapacity, as a minority, but rather as a British problem created by the actionof Great Britain.    His Majesty&apos;s  Government had given the Princes so
much power that they now felt some difficulty in throwing them away. Forhis part he would be content with a referendum to States subjects. If, asa result of such referendum, the States peoples were to say that they wishedto remain under autocratic rule, he would be quite ready to accept that. Buthe thought it unlikely that that would be the popular choice in any veryconsiderable number of States. He had recently been talking to one of hislieutenants charged with the conduct of matters affecting the States, andhe was assured that in the case of most Princes they had no tradition totrade on, were creatures of Great Britain, maintained by her, and possessingno sense of responsibility. He would always be glad, at the request of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, to meet the Princes or their representatives, but he couldnot undertake the job of placating the Princes. Despite his years, he would be quite prepared to go to Great Britain and preach the doctrine in which he believed to the British people, who, he thought, would share his views, and wouldunderstand them, in regard to the Indian States. He felt indeed that it wouldbe a less formidable task to persuade the British public to take his view than tosatisfy the Princes themselves that they should accept his views about the future position of the Indian States in the All-India constitution.13. For his part he would without hesitation accept at the moment theindependence of British India alone, leaving the States to Great Britain whichhad created them. He was not one of those who thought that Great britain would stoop so low as to use the Indian States as a jumping-off ground for thereconquest of British India. These were his general and disjointed views at thisstage in any event. But he did not regard the problem of the Indian States asan urgent one.The Muslims.14. Mr. Gandhi then turned to the question of the Muslim minorities. Tosatisfy their apprehensions the Congress, he said, would go the whole lengthand would guarantee to protect their religion, their culture, their personal law,their language, and the like. If the Muslims had a complaint against anyCongress provincial government, they could certainly take Ministers to a tribunal to be set up under arrangements to be mutually agreed.The Scheduled Castes.15. As for the Scheduled Castes, he wondered whether Great Britain couldprotect their interests as effectively as the Congress. Had we, for example,succeeded in opening the temples to the Harijans? He had noticed my allusionsin the Orient Club speech to the Scheduled Castes, and wondered what it wasall about. He thought that the problem was already covered by arrangements with which I would be familiar. Apart from that aspect, the congress ministries had safeguarded, and if they should return to office, would continueto safeguard, the interests of the Scheduled Castes. He could not make terms with Dr. Ambedkar, who did not even represent all the Mahars. The tale of the achievement and progress of the Scheduled Castes in the past few years gaveample warrant for the proposition that they were adequately cared for. They had gone ahead by leaps and bounds.The Europeans.16. He would now turn to the position of the Europeans. On that he would only say that when the British parted with power they should not ask for special protection for European interests. The Europeans, like the Zamindars and otherproperty owners, would have to depend on the mercy of future democraticgovernments in India. No special obligation or protection peculiar to the europeans could form part of any final settlement. The constitution wouldcontain certain appropriate safeguards for property and a provision that thereshould be no confiscation without compensation to be adjusted by a tribunal.17. I asked Mr. Gandhi what he meant by safeguards. Was their validityor their authority to be derived from a joint arrangement made at the time ofagreement, or in their ordinary functions by the new government under,e.g., Dominion Status?  Mr. Gandhi replied categorically that no such safeguards
would find no place in a settlement between Britain and India. They must be part of the spontaneous response of an Indian government to the need of protecting the legitimate interests and the rights of property.Future Status of India.18. Mr. Gandhi proceeded that he had noted in regard to the future status of India that in my speech at the Orient Club at Bombay I guaranteed dominion status of the Statute of Westminster variety. He did not think it necessary oreven wise for me to give any such guarantee. It was for India to choose herstatus-not for us to make a limited offer. Australia, Canada, and the otherDominions were one thing. India was another. India could never be a daughterState, for her roots did not lie in England. Furthermore, I must understand thedifficulty which Indians felt in accepting the phrase &quot; full partnership in theCommonwealth.&quot; What about the position of Indians in South Africa?Mr. Gandhi enlarged at very considerable length on the grossly unjust treatmentof Indians in that Dominion. He went on to repeat that it was not for us to limit our offer. It should be an offer to India to choose what she wanted. Let theConstituent Assembly settle the whole question of status.19. Some of his colleagues in the Working Committee, when he had expressed approval of my Orient Club speech, had made it plain that they thoughtnothing of it. He had replied that he could not agree, as it had expressed witha clearness not previously evident the precise nature of our offer. But, far moreimportant, it struck ti new note in friendly and sjmipathetic understanding. he told his friends that the wording of the speech suggested to him that he mightbe able to coax the Viceroy to extend the bounds of his offer : that he would cometo see me in that faith, and that in that faith he would be prepared to conduct negotiations for the purpose.20. I replied that I quite understood the position he had taken. I wouldlike in the first place to say a word or two on his remarks about the ScheduledCastes. He would believe that I had done my best to familiarise myself withthe precise position. I had grasped that the roots of the settlement culminatingin the Poona Pact had been the desire on all hands to come to an arrangement which while assuaging the apprehensions of the Scheduled Castes would notdivide the persons who comprised those castes from the main body of Hinduism.I understood the extent to which the Scheduled Caste position was met withinthe four corners of the Act of 1935, and the fact that the covenant between the scheduled Castes and the Caste Hindus to which I had referred did not dependon the immediate constitutional environment in which it had been arrived at, but was of such a nature that it would retain its validity and permanence in any new constitutional position that might develop. The Pact was only to disappear by mutual agreement. At the same time, however, I thought he would agree that, ifany change of circumstances induced an unmistakable manifestation of alarm oruneasiness on the part of the Scheduled Castes as a whole, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment could not remain altogether unconcerned. Thus, if the Scheduled Casteswere able to claim that in any new arrangement preparatory to, e.g., dominion status, the terms of the Poona Pact had been disregarded without their consent,that would be a matter which would at once attract the responsibility of HisMajesty&apos;s Government for the protection of the Scheduled Caste interests.Mr. Gandhi said that he was glad to find that I had the position clear in my mind, and that he did not disagree with anything that I had said.21. I then said that it was clear to me that we were still he speaking forthe Congress, I speaking for His Majesty&apos;s Government- -a considerable distanceapart. I had no desire by any undue brevity in presentation to emphasise theextent of the difference between us. But he would understand that I was workingwithin very definite limits. Would it help him if I at once told him what broadlywas the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government at this time?22. Mr. Gandhi said he would prefer to proceed in that way. He had toldhis friends before he came here that he would not be disappointed or surprisedif he came away empty-handed : he thought it much better that I should tell himquite frankly how matters stood than that I should gioze over the difficulties ordifferences that confronted us both.
23. I said that I agreed, and that I would put him in possession of theposition, and of the offer of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I hardly thought itnecessary to repeat to him what I had said on that matter at Bombay. But I might formally tell him that in the first place His Majesty&apos;s Government retaineda fixed intention to enable a unified India to attain Dominion Status at theearliest possible date.24. Secondly, he would again be aware from my public speeches that their offer in regard to the expansion of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council still held good. In that connection, though we had not so far discussed it in detail,it might help him now and afterwards if I said that I held definitely to the view expressed to him before that this offer should be regarded as an earnest, and asa token of the determination of His Majesty&apos;s Government to proceed towardsresponsible government at the Centre, but that I was convinced that any attemptto expand this part of the offer so as to develop it into Cabinet Government atthe Centre along with responsibility as between the expanded Council and theLegislature would lead to disappointment, and that I must therefore resist it.I would be glad at some other time to develop in all particulars my views about these difficulties : meanwhile suffice it to say that any attempt of the kind towhich I had referred was likely in my judgment to lead to a confusion of responsibilities, to legal and technical difficulties, and to an artificiality, whichwould all be highly dangerous. If the Governor-General was to be in a positionof being constitutionally bound to accept the advice of a majority of the Cabinet,it was essential that real responsibility should run between the Legislature andthat Cabinet, and that Ministers should know that their lives depended upon the vote of the Legislature. The sort of arrangement which had been in my mindhad been to place 4 seats at the disposal of political parties, say, 2 to Congress,1 to the Muslim League, and one to be filled from outside those bodies.25. Then again Mr. Gandhi would not be surprised to learn that HisMajesty&apos;s Government still had it in mind, as soon as the requisite number of states had acceded, to push on with the inauguration of Federation. It was true in the meantime that owing to the outbreak of war I had to suspend thearrangements preliminary to the inauguration of Federation. But, with theagreement of all parties concerned, there was no reason why they should notbe again resumed even during the war. I would only say that I did not regard this part of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government as in any way incompatible with an undertaking to secure Dominion Status at the earliest possible moment.Indeed I myself regarded the federal scheme as by far the most practicablemethod of achieving the early unification of the Indian States and British India.It was quite true that as one of those who had had some share in the framing ofthe Act of 1935 I had myself previously contemplated a period of years betweenthe achievement of Federation and the outcome of Dominion Status. But Irecognised that the outbreak of war had hastened these developments, and insome measure contracted the time-scale envisaged. To my way of thinking,however, the machinery of Part II could be most appropriately used as the means by which we could reach at the earliest possible moment India&apos;s goal of completeself-government within the Empire.26. Incidentally I might tell him that, in considering what arrangements might be made for consultation between His Majesty&apos;s Government, orParliament, and Indians themselves on the question of the revision of theconstitution, many of us felt that use might be made of the Federal Legislature,broadly based and representative as it would be, for the purpose of constitutingthe Indian element which would conduct the enquiry. If I understood mattersrightly he and his friends, in speaking of a Constituent Assembly, wereprincipally concerned to ensure that India&apos;s representatives should be electedrather than nominated or selected.27. What all this came to, then, was that His Majesty&apos;s Government were most eager to go forward, as soon as conditions were ripe, with practical proposalsfor the attainment of Dominion Status under which within the shortestpracticable time India might achieve her goal of full self-government within theEmpire. Mr. Gandhi was now in possession of the offer which I was empoweredto put forward on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the limits withinwhich I could conduct negotiation.   I had no desire in any way to overstate the
differences between us, and I would be only too glad to discuss any points thatMr. Gandhi might suggest, or to clear any uncertainties that might exist inhis mind.28. Mr. Gandhi said that he was now perfectly clear on the whole position.He felt no uncertainties regarding it, and there were no questions which he wished to ask me. He felt, however, that the discussion which had taken place between us clearly showed that there was not a sufficient amount of common ground to render further discussions profitable at this stage. The truth was thatthis whole business was something that had to grow. He was quite sure that indue time it would develop in a direction which would make the resumption of negotiations fruitful. Meanwhile, he thought it better not to attempt to concealfrom the public that our examination of the position, though carried on in themost friendly spirit, had shown quite definitely that for the present no negotia-tions could be expected to yield constructive results.29. I said that the public might well require to know something of what had taken place.  &quot;What sort of announcement would he contemplate as suitable.30. Mr. Gandhi suggested that we might say that there had been a prolonged and friendly discussion between him and me, but that for the present no further negotiations were to take place between us.31. I said I should like to think this over. Parliament might, I wouldjudge, in the light of questions which had been asked a few days ago, be veryinsistent to know what was the nature of the offer I had made; and it might,therefore, well be desirable for me to ask him to agree to an announcementembodying the terms of the offer which I had put forward. I would draftsomething as soon as possible, so that the announcement could be made before he left Delhi to-morrow. Mr. Gandhi agreed. (I append to this record a copy of the communique as finally agreed between us.)32. In conclusion I said to Mr. Gandhi that while we had been unable, tomy disappointment, to reach agreement, I would beg that we should not allowthis meeting to do harm even if it could not do good. I realised that he had ananxious time in Congress, and that this meeting at Ramgarh lay ahead of him.Mr. Gandhi replied that he entirely agreed; that as for Ramgarh he could not say what would happen, but that he was anxious to avoid fireworks there ifpossible, and had great hopes that he would succeed.33. We then briefly discussed the position in regard to Coalition Ministrieson an enquiry from me as to his attitude in that matter. He replied that he did not think that there was anything doing with the Muslim League in theirpresent mood, and that it was a question of satisfying office-seekers and place-hunters, a process which could not settle an issue as major as this, though hegreatly regretted that he should have to use such words of his own countrymen.I commented that I did not feel much affection for coalitions in principle, though some of the Governors were disposed to think that, given goodwill and apreviously agreed programme, coalitions for a limited time might get on verynicely. I did not, again speaking personally, like jettisoning collective responsi-bility, which was so important at this stage to our political development in India.The justification for the sacrifice involved in coalitions was, I supposed, that wewere all devoting months or years to mitigating the acerbities of communalantagonisms with a view to real progress later on. Mr. Gandhi said that hefollowed the argument perfectly, but did not think that at this stage anything more was to be gained by coalitions.34. Our meeting was of the most friendly character. I was, I confess,surprised that Mr. Gandhi, as representing the Congress, should have adopted sonegative an attitude.I find it a little difficult at this stage to be quite certain as to the probableexplanation. It may lie in a feeling that the tide is on the side of Congress andthat they will do better to postpone a settlement until later. It may arise out oftheir apprehension of difficulty with the Left Wing at the forthcoming conference at Ramgarh (Mr. Gandhi had been very emphatic as to the attitude ofelements in the Working Committee and of Vallabhbhai Patel toAvards anagreement between us). But it is the more noteworthy coming as it does onconversations initiated at Mr. Gandhi&apos;s own suggestion (though I recognise the
possibility that he may merely have been anxious to put himself on good groundby some public gesture in return for that made by me at the Orient Club inJanuary); and at a moment when Mr. Fazlul Huq and Sir Sikander Hyat Khanhad indicated their readiness to make the sacrifice involved for them in accepting the principle of Coalition Ministries, and when the Muslim League had restatedtheir claims in an even more positive manner than before. But while the explanation may lie in a combination of these factors, I confess that I find none of them wholfy convincing, and am still somewhat puzzled as to the motive whichdictated his attitude towards the propositions which I had been authorised to putforward to him.L.New Delhi, February 5, 1940.Note of an Interview between His Excellency the Viceroy and Mr. M. A.JlNNAH at THE VlCEROY&apos;s house, on tuesday, february 6, 1940.IN response to an invitation from me, Mr. M. A. Jinnah came to see meto-day. It was obvious that he was in very good fettle, and that the develop-ments with Mr. Gandhi yesterday had caused him no dissatisfaction. After theusual compliments he opened the proceedings by asking me what we were nowto do. Assuming that &apos;&apos; we &apos;&apos; meant the Muslim League, I thought it well toencourage him to move into a constructive position, and I emphasized on the familiar lines the impossibility of maintaining a purely negative position, the propaganda value of a constructive plan, and the weakness on a long sight of thepresent situation.2. He told me that he had listend with great interest to what I had said,and that the two specific questions which he would like to clear were first what&quot; we,&quot; by which he meant all parties other than Congress, were to do in face ofthe position which had now been reached and in view of the war.Second, the question, which he recognised was an entirely different issue, ofwhat was to be done when we came to the question of the future constitution ofIndia. On that point, in spite of the different view which he was aware thatMr. Gandhi held, his own judgment was clear that such examination could onlylead to a preliminary stage. It was out of the question to go straight to dominion status, or anything approaching it. from existing, conditions.3. I said to Mr. Jinnah that as regards the first point he had raised, I had reluctantly to admit that my efforts to reach accommodation satisfactory to all parties had for the moment received a set-back. But even if that meant a post-ponement for the time being, and the persistence in the maintenance of theemergency provisions of the Act, he must not think that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment or I would for an instant relax our endeavours to return to the normal working of the constitutional scheme. Quite apart from the unfortunate positionOut here where the government of those provinces which had previously been administered by a Congress Ministry and in which no alternative arrangementhad proved practicable now approximated to the conditions of 1860, we were faced with the fact that neither public opinion in Great Britain nor parliament would for a moment countenance, or acquiesce in, the maintenance of a section 93position unless they were satisfied that we were making constant and active efforts to escape from it.4. Mr. Jinnah said that he quite understood. Could I, however, hope to achieve unity, much as I might be anxious to do so ? He begged me to realisewhat he described as the dreadful effect of this suspense in India. I had neverappeared to break with Gandhi, and I always left India with the impression thatI was going to see him again before very long and that negotiations were goingto be reopened. That in turn, as I would understand, produced throughout thecommunity the fear that Congress governments might return to office at any moment. &quot; Fear &quot; was the correct word even among Congressmen. Three yearsago the allegiance and obedience to Congress Ministries would have been forlove. Power to-day was derived from their capacity to inculcate fear. Congressex-Ministers were going about all over the country saying that they were comingback this week, next week, in the immediate future.   How could any healthy
reaction against Congress develop in conditions such as these ? His advice insuch circumstances to me and to His Majesty&apos;s Government was to make it clear to Congress without undue delay that there was nothing - doing; and that thisnonsense had to stop, in the same way as Lord Willingdon had done someyears ago.5. I replied to Mr. Jinnah that I had no doubt that he appreciated thedifference in the statutory position between to-day and the point at which lord Willingdon had so successfully dealt with the difficulties then confrontinghim. I felt certain that he realised, too, that Congress Ministers could return to office in the provinces in which they could command a majority in the Legislatureon any day on which they chose.6. Mr. Jinnah said that that might be so, but that if the Congress Ministriesdid so return in existing conditions, there would be civil war in India.7. I said that that was a very grave utterance to be made by a man in hisresponsible position : but that, even if he meant what he said, the fact remainedthat the Constitution, being part of the law of the land, would have to be respectedin its present form unless and until the law was altered.8. Mr. Jinnah said that he found it quite impossible to understand our attitude towards Congress, in face of the fact that the pledge taken by congress and its supporters on &quot; Independence Day &quot; was, in his considered opinion as alawyer, treasonable in terms of our own law.9. I repeated that, whatever the difficulties and the uncertainties of thepresent position, Mr. Jinnah must take it from me that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand I would miss no opportunity, subject always, of course, to due care for the legitimate interests of all minorities, of persuading Congress Ministers to returnto office in those provinces in which they were supported by a majority of theLegislature.10. Passing from this matter, I asked Mr. Jinnah whether he desiredduring our present conversation to deal with the points raised in my letter tohim of the 23rd December. Mr. Jinnah replied that he would prefer to com-municate his views in writing. I said that, in this context, I was not entirelyhappy about a position in which the public were aware that my letter had been written and in which they were seized of a certain number of points in it throughthe communiques released by the Working Committee of the Muslim League, butin which the text had not been released and so was not available to them.Mr. Jinnah agreed that this was hardly satisfactory, and expressed his readinessforthwith to release the text of my letter of the 23rd December, together with the ancillary documents (his original letter to me of the 5th November, and the interim correspondence regarding publication which had passed between us).11. We then turned to Mr. Jinnah&apos;s second point referred to in paragraph above. Mr. Jinnah asked if I wished to discuss this matter with him now; and Ireplied that I should very much like to hear his views. He said that he was notyet in a position to present in detail the considered opinion of his colleagues and himself on this very important subject, but that he would very shortly be ready todo so. Might he come and see me a little later on in the season and put me inpossession of the formulated opinions of the Muslim League ? He and his friends were disposed on the whole to take the view that to publish in full theirformulated opinions as to the constructive steps to be taken for the future would at this stage, from their standpoint, be inadvisable, since it would needlesslyexpose surface to criticism. They would prefer to wait until His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had reached the point at which they would say to the Muslim League&quot; What are your views? &quot; He and his colleagues would, he could assure me, beready to speak once such enquiry was made of them.12. I said that that was all very well: that I fully understood the tacticalconvenience from his point of view of a purely negative attitude at this stageas opposed to an attempt to formulate and publish a constructive policy. But,if I might say so, this plan for postponing any announcement of the constructiveprogramme of the Muslim League until the last moment failed altogether to meetthe requirements of propaganda. With his great experience he would notdisagree with me when I said that it was impossible to hope to be able to educate
public opinion in Great Britain, and more particularly the 600 odd representativesof constituencies in the House of Commons, by the submission of a formalmemorandum to His Majesty&apos;s Government, or by the leading of evidence beforesome committee, on the eve of critical decisions. If he and his friends wanted to secure that the Muslim case should not go by default in the United Kingdom,it was really essential that they should formulate their plan in the near future.At the risk of wearying him I was bound to repeat what I had often said before that I was convinced that it was quite useless to appeal for support in GreatBritain for a party whose policy was one of sheer negation. Many shades ofopinion, as we both well knew, existed in that country. But beyond a very small number of ultra-conservative persons it was, I thought, true to say that noresponsible opinion would accept the idea that standing still, much less going back, in India was the right way to solve our difficulties. There was much inthis intractable problem that was open. But this much at least was clear, thatthere was no refuge for any of us in sheer reaction.13. Mr. Jinnah replied that he had listened with attention to my views,and that he was disposed to feel that he and his friends would probably be wise to make public at any rate the outlines of their position in time to allow them to explain that position both in Great Britain and in India.14. He then said that he would like a word with me about the position inthe North-West Frontier Province. He had had representatives of his partyfrom that province in attendance at the time of the Working Committee meetingof the Muslim League a couple of days ago, and they had all very carefully considered the whole position. The outcome of their deliberations was that, while they could not see a clear majority for a Muslim League Ministry in the North-West Frontier Province at the moment, they were quite confident that if theGovernor would give them some sort of accommodation in terms of time, similarto that which had been given by the Governor of Assam to his Ministry, theycould secure a majority within a short time. Would Sir George Cunninghamgive them the required support ? It was necessary that they should have some idea of prospects in this regard. Till they knew that they were going to be helped, they could hardly themselves make a forward move. Once they weregiven to understand that they could count on the support of the Governor, SirSikander Hyat Khan would be ready to visit the province and to initiate thenecessaiy steps. The best moment for this stroke would be after the Governor&apos;budget. Mr. Jinnah added that he was most anxious, if possible, to put thisthrough, as he was convinced that there could be no more salutary lesson forCongress and no better advertisement of the real position in India, whether before the country or throughout the world, than that a non-Congress ministry should be established in the North-West Frontier Province. He was thereforemost anxious to bring this matter to a successful issue.15. I replied that I should of course be most satisfied if the normal workingof the constitution could be restored in the North-West Frontier Province bythe appointment of a government with a majority in the legislature which would stand the test when the Assembly met. I felt bound, however, to tell him thatI could think of few things more disastrous than that an attempt such as he had outlined should at the first test of the Government&apos;s parliamentary positioncollapse. So far as the attitude of Sir George Cunningham to any such proposal was concerned, there was, as he would of course understand, nothing that I could say in any way to-day. But I would communicate his views to the Governor, andhe and his friends would in due course and by one means or other be put inpossession of the Governor&apos;s views.L.New Delhi, February 6, 1940.
