in the arrangements for the issue of the Message ofCondolence and the Message should now he sent in respect ofall. deaths since the outbreak of war in circumstances which otherwise qualify.    Until experience has been gained,  the six weeks&apos;  limit should not be applied in the Merchant navy and Pishing Fleets.Sections 5 and 4.Consideration of proposals for the introduction ofMemorial Scrolls and Plaques and a King&apos;s Certificate ondischarge should be postponed for at least twelve months.Section 5.A Badge should be instituted for personnel invalided fromthe military Forces and Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleetsthrough wounds or disability attributable to war service.It is also recommended that the Ministry of pensions should be responsible, as agents for the Departments, for thedistribution of the Message of Condolence to the relations ofmen of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets and for thedistribution of the Badge to invalided Imperial service personnel of the Forces, and disabled mariners who have beenserving in United Kingdom registered ships.The previous Report (W.P.

i .    THE ROYAL MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE AND THE MILITARY SERVICES.(A) Action,already taken.The King has, on the recommendation of the WarCabinet, given Commands that a Royal Message ofCondolence should be despatched to the relations ofmembers of tho fighting Services who have lost their lives on active sear-vice.     The Message is as follows.-&quot;The Quo on arid % offer you our heartfeltsympathy in your great sorrow.Wo pray that your country&apos;s gratitude for alife so nobly given in its service may bring yousome measure of consolation. &quot;The questions at issue? Which have been referred to us, relating1 to tho Royal Message and themilitary Services, fall under three headings -(B) Personnel to bo includedj    (0) Manner of deathqualifying;    and (&amp;) Variations in the wording of the message.(B) Personnel to be included.Certain Officers and men of the Merchant navy and Fishing Fleets are employed in commissioned auxiliariesof the Royal Navy oh what&apos;are known as &quot;T.12U,&quot; or &quot;F. 1 2h&quot;agreements.     We rocommend that such individuals, though not strictly members of a Military Service, should beincluded In the system, if they lose their lives in circumstances which would qualify for a message if theybelonged to the Royal Navy or one of its reserve forces.It is intended that Nurses and V.A.D. Nursespaid from the funds of the military Departments shouldbo included in this scheme.     Members of women&apos;auxiliary corps were not included during the last war.The distribution is to be limited to deaths among&quot;members of the fighting Services&quot;.     This includes non-combatant bodies in the three military Services, andalthough the women&apos;s auxiliary corps are not technicallya part of the Navy, Army or* Air Force and do not fall,therefore, within the definition, we recommend theinclusion in the scheme of the Women1s Royal naval service, the Auxiliary Territorial Service and theWomen1a Auxiliary Air Force.(C) Manner of death qualifying.The distribution of the Message is limited to cases of death falling within the description &quot;a life sonobly given&quot; in the country&apos;b -service, and &quot;those whohave lost their lives on active service&quot;.     It would be practicable to limit the issue: to death as the directresult of enemy action, or to extend it to cover allcases of death by accident or disease.We recommend the adoption of a course lyingbetween those two extremes.

There would he included, cases of death(1) due to the direct result of enemy action;(2) from accident on duty or arising directly out of theemployment;e. g.in collision between one of H.M. Ships and another vessel;due to loss or damage to one of H.M.  Ships owing tocontact with a British mine;due to flying accidents when on duty hut not in combatwith the enemy;due to handling of lethal weapons, gun explosions, and so forth, no distinction being made between causes contain-ing no &quot;active service risk&quot; compared with civil risks,and causes containing a large &quot;active service risk&quot;;in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines from accidents at sea or on board ship,  in harbour or in barracks, etc.including those of a kind which might easily occur inpeace, as the result, for instance, of ordinary marinerisks;(3) from disease attributable to war service;e.g.disease following exposure in the course of active operations against the enemy;(h) materially hastened by a wound, injury or disease directlyattributable to military service during the war;(5) due to a wound, injury or disease which(i) arose during war service or existed before such service;and(ii) was aggravated by war service to a material extent, and,but for such aggravation, would not have taken place, or was materially hastened by such aggravation.There would be excluded, cases of death(6) in disgraceful circumstances;(7) due to negligence or misconduct of deceased;(8) from air raids, etc., when on leave in the territory of origin of a formation, from a.unit stationed either in that territory or overseas.(An individual who has, on account of the air raids,immediately joined some unit other than his own would notbe regarded as any longer on leave);(9) from car accidents when on leave in the United Kingdom fromunits stationed in the United Kingdom or overseas, or whenstationed in the United Kingdom but not on duty;(10) from other accidents not connected with the employment, if noton duty;e.g.when &quot;walking out&quot;;(11) from disease not attributable to, or aggravated by, war service;(12) after discharge from the military Services.-h-

Should casualties clue to enemy action increase,  theabove rules-  if adopted, will probably enable the staffs ofthe military Departments to deal with the majority of cases^but there will be others which will require the exercise of discrimination.The question of attributability, the criterion here .adopted, is, for personnel of United Kingdom formations, decided by the Ministry of Pensions and in doubtful cases it will benecessary for the military Department concerned to await the finding of that Department.      If this should not be available at some fixed period after news of the death is firstconveyed to the relatives by the Department, perhaps six weeks,we consider that the Royal Message should not be sent at all.It would be necessary to alter it, if it were then sent.Clearly,  to send the Royal Message in circumstances in whichthe Ministry of Pensions ultimately decide to refuserecognition of liability will cause embarrassment to that department.Should Memorial Scrolls ultimately be issued, then the Scroll would reach relatives who might be omitted fromthe distribution of the Royal Message of Condolence solely onaccount of this time limit of six weeks.For United Kingdom formations we recommend that incases falling under (1 ) and clear cases under (2)  the militaryDepartments should as a rule despatch the Royal Message without reference to the Ministry of Pensions.      Doubtful cases under(2) and all cases of death falling under (3)?  (h) and (5)should, we consider, be referred to the Ministry of Pensions.As, under the scheme we recommend, deaths after discharge are excluded by (12)  it is improbable that cases falling forconsideration under (3),  (h) and (5) will be numerous.For Indian and Colonial formations doubtful questions- of attributability would be settled in similar fashion by theappropriate pension authorities respectively.\7e recommend that the arrangements to be adopted for United Kingdom personnel should be explained to theDominion Governments, and we hope that they will be preparedto agree to adopt a similar procedure and similar tests for.  entitlement.(D)    Variations in the wording of the Message.We recommend the following modifications in the formof the Message, for special purposes.(1 )    For European and Indian British subjects in India. -&quot;The Queen-Empress and I offer you our heartfeltsympathy in your great sorrow. -We pray that your Country&apos;s gratitude for a lifeso nobly given in its service may bring you some measure of consolation.&quot;

(2) For Indian States Subjects.&quot;The Queen-Empress and I offer you our heartfeltsympathy in your&quot; great sorrow.We pray that the Empire&apos;s gratitude for a lifeso nobly given in its service may bring you some measure of consolation.&apos;1(3) For Nepalese Subjects.&quot;The Queen and I offer you our heartfelt sympathyin your great sorrow.&quot;(^) For British subjects and protected persons in Colonies,Protectorates and Mandated Territories, also for aliensserving in the British Forces.&quot;The Queen and I offer you our heartfelt sympathyin your great sorrow.We pray that the Empire&apos;s gratitude for a lifeso nobly given in Its service may bring you some measure of consolation.&quot;2.     THE ROYAL MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE AND THE MERCHANT NAVY.Later in this Report we recommend the postponementfor the present of any further consideration of a scheme forthe preparation of Memorial Scrolls and Memorial Plaques.      Asa result it is not now open to us to recommend the grant of aScroll or Plaque to relatives of deceased mariners of the merchant navy and Fishing Fleets in lieu of the Royal Message of Condolence,which has been restricted to the military Services.We therefore recommend that the arrangements for theissue of the Royal Message of Condolence should now be extended and that it should be sent to relatives of Officers and men ofthe Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets, including members of thePilotage and Light Vessel Services.The issue of the Message should, we think, be limited tothose cases of death which qualify dependants for benefits underthe War Pensions and Detention Allowances  (Mercantile Marine, etc.)Scheme, 1939, or would so qualify dependants were there any such.The Royal Message would, in our view, be best despatchedby the Ministry of Pensions, who are responsible for making the awards under the Pensions Scheme.      The Department, acting asagent in this way, should see that the Messages and envelopesbear no departmental markings, and are despatched only from london.The position of Indian seamen serving in United Kingdomregistered ships will require special consideration.3.    MEMORIAL. SCROLLS AND MEMORIAL PLAQUES.-We are aware of the objections raised by departments responsible for the Civil Defence Organisation and other

important civil activities to the issue of Memorial Scrollsand Memorial Plaques.      We appreciate that should MemorialScrolls and Plaques he instituted, then under the conditionswhich are expected in the present war,  it may he almost impossible, with justification, ultimately to confine them tothe relatives of those killed on duty while serving in the Navy,Army, Air Force and Merchant Navy.      If air attack becomessevere, members of other Services may be killed on duty in circumstances giving their relatives an equal claim to a memorial Scroll;    for instance, members of the Civil Service,of the Local Authority, Police and Fire Services, of the civil defence Organisation, of Voluntary Services outside that organisation,  of the Women&apos;s Land Army and so forth, as well as members of staffs of contractors working for the Ministry ofSupply or other Government Departments.      The relatives ofmembers of the general public killed helping others may also consider that they   have some claim.     Moreover there are likelynot infrequently to be difficulties with regard to the identification-tion of the victim and the tracing of the next of kin in the caseof civilian casualties which do not arise in the military Services.If it were now essential to lay down the lines onwhich any future distribution should be made, we should be inclined to take the view that this should at any rate, belimited to the relatives of deceased members of.regular ordefinitely enrolled bodies,  contractors&apos;  staffs and the general public being omitted.We take the view, however, that as the course of future events is in so much doubt, and as the casualty ratein the military Services is on the whole comparatively low,consideration of the introduction of a Memorial Scroll and a memorial Plaque should be postponed for the present.      Thequestion might perhaps be reviewed in twelve months&apos;  time.U.     THE KING&apos;S CERTIFICATE FOR INVALIDED PERSONNEL.We recommend also that consideration of the questionof the issue of a King&apos;s Certificate for invalided personnelshould be postponed.      The subject might be reviewediaftertwelve months,5.     THE BADGE FOR INVALIDED PERSONNEL.We recommend that a Badge bearing the cypherof the Sovereign and of a pattern easily distinguishable fromthat issued during the last war should be&quot;instituted in the nearfuture, and that it should be restricted, for the present,  to individuals invalided from the military Services and the merchant navy and Fishing Fleets.      Consideration of the question of extending the Badge to other Services should, we think, be postponed for. the present;    that problem might be reconsidered insay twelve months&apos;  time..For the Navy, Army and Air Force, the issue should, inour view, be limited to invaliding due to disability attributable to military service, and in the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleetsto disablement directly attributable to war injuries or detention.For United Kingdom personnel, the distribution should be governed by the definitions of those terms in the Royal Warrant for retired pay, Pension, etc., for Members of the Military Forces Disabled,etc.. 1939? and in the War Pensions and Detention Allowances(Mercantile Marine, etc.)    Scheme, 1939? respectively.

We recommend that for Indian and Colonial formationsand.services equivalent tests should he applied,      V/e consider thatthe arrangements to he adopted for United Kingdom personnel shouldhe explained to the Dominion Governments, and we hope that theywill he prepared to agree to adopt a similar procedure and similar tests for entitlement.      The position of Indian seamenserving in United Kingdom ships will require special consideration.The provision and issue of the Badge might conveniently,we consider, he undertaken, for Imperial Service personnel and formariners of United Kingdom registered ships, by the Ministry ofPensions&apos;, on behalf of the Departments directly concerned.It will be noted that we do not recommend the grantof the Badge to individuals discharged through age, as in thelast war.      This restriction would bring the distribution more closely into line with that which it may be desired ultimately to adopt for any King&apos;s Certificate on discharge.      On theother hand, the system we recommend would admit some individualsdischarged through disability attributable to service in theUnited Kingdom, but not due to enemy action.      These would havereceived the Badge under such conditions during the last war,but not the Certificate.      The conditions of service of military personnel in the United Kingdom in, for Instance, the Anti-Aircraft units of the Army and the Operational Commands of theRoyal Air Force are so different from those of the war of1 91 d-1 8 that,  should a King&apos;s Certificate on discharge begranted, we doubt whether it will be practicable to restrict itin the United Kingdom to those injured by enemy action.      we hope that the system which would be used for the issue of anyKing&apos;s Certificate would be similar in character to the system which we recommend should now be introduced for the grant of aBadge, so that the same tests would be applied.(Signed) &apos;     H.J.. WILSONon behalf of the Committee.Treasury Chambers,Whitehall,S.W.I.6th March, 19UO.

H.W.78.A. CONFIDENTIALCOMMITTEE ON THE GRANT OF HONOURS, DECORATIONS AND MEDALSIN TIME OF WAR.1939   -   1940APPENDIX TO EIGHTH REPORT.THE ROYAL MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE, MEMORIAL SCROLLS AND PLAQUES,THE KING rS CERTIFICATE&quot;AND&apos;BADGE ON DISCHARGE.Our Report on the above subjects, dated 6th March,(H.W.78), was sent by Lord Chatfield, then Minister forCo-ordination of Defence,  to all the other Ministers concerned.There is general agreement with the recommendations and thefollowing suggestion has been made by the Minister of Pensions.As the Royal Message of Condolence has been issued for monthspast for casualties in the military Services, a great deal of discontent will; he considers, be caused if it is now issued,for casualties in the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets, only inrespect of deaths which have occurred during the past six weeks.In the&apos; opinion of Sir Walter Womersley, the Message should alsobe issued, at any rate, to widows, for casualties that occurred in the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets in the eai^lier monthsof the war.Towards the end of March the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence referred this suggestion to theCommittee and it has now been considered on their behalf bymyself and the Members representing the Ministry of Pensions,  theMinistry of Shipping and the Scottish Office, and also by representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.We recommend that the suggestion should be adopted and that theRoyal Message of Condolence should be sent to relatives ofOfficers and men of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets,including members of the Pilotage and Light Vessel services,

Treasury Chambers,Whitehall,S.W. 1 ..5th April,  192+0whose death has occurred since the outbreak of war, in circumstances which otherwise qualify for the despatch of the message, in accordance with the terms of our Report.We do not consider that a change will be necessaryin the form of the Message when issued retrospectively in thisway, provided that the name of the recipient and the name, ofdeceased, marked &quot;deceased&quot;, are typed on the back.We also recommend that until experience has been gained,  the six weeks&apos;  limit which is recommended for adoptionfor the despatch of the Message for military casualties shouldnot be applied in the Merchant Navy and Pishing Fleets.The late Minister of Shipping concurred in theseproposals, and we have ascertained that they have the supportof the Ministers of the other Departments concerned,(signed) H.J. WILSON,on behalf of the Committee.
