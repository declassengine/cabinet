There is a shortage of labour for the British Expeditionary Force, therequirements of which are very high because of the number of French portsused (16), the broad extent of depots and the number and the dispersal of aerodromes.This labour is employed on concreting work in forward areas, the construe -tion of roads and railways, the preparation of sites for aerodromes, theconstruction of the aerodromes and accommodation for personnel and stores, andthe handling and storage of the vast quantities of munitions and other stores and supplies transported and accumulated in France.2. The total labour force required is estimated to be 60,000 by the end ofj une, 1940, and 120,000 by June, 1941, the increase after June, 1940, taking place at the rate of 5,000 a month.3. To provide this labour the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps has beenformed.4. Recruits for the A.M.P.C. have been found so far by voluntary enlistmentfrom men in the age group 35-50. But this group also provides Home DefenceBattalions and Overseas Defence Battalions. Recruiting for the A.M.P.C. is steadily falling, and there is no longer any hope of obtaining by this meansanything like the full numbers referred to in paragraph 2.5. It is expected that in addition to those enlisted in the A.M.P.C. in thiscountry a few thousand labourers will be recruited from Cyprus and otherColonies. Some have also been raised in France from Italian subjects and fromother foreigners, mostly refugees domiciled in France, who are liable, underFrench law, for ancillary military service. The numbers so raised, however,will be a fraction of the total required.6. While some more satisfying solution is being sought, the Army council are intensifying the recruiting effort in order to increase the number of voluntaryrecruits for the A.M.P.C. in the age group 35-50; they will also make use ofcertain Grade II men from the Army classes, who have not so far been used.These measures might produce about 15,000 men.7. It is not expected that a total labour force of more than 23,000 will befound from all these sources by June, 1940, or of more than 30,000 by June, 1941.8. It is further proposed as a temporary measure to send portions of 3 ofthe Divisions which will not be required as such for the British ExpeditionaryForce for many months, and to use them for labour duties. They should provideat least 16,000.The main disadvantage of this course is that it will involve a temporarydispersal of the units and breaking up of the Divisions as combatant formationsto the detriment of their training.
g. The proposals referred to above would not provide a final solution to theproblem. Even if three divisions, as suggested in paragraph 8, were keptout until June, 1941, there would still be lacking some 74,000 by that date.It is therefore necessary to consider what further or alternative courses are practicable.   The following have been considered:  (a) To allow men in lower age groups (excluding 20-27) to volunteer for theA.M.P.C.(b) To post men from the Army classes direct to the A.M.P.C.(c) To apply compulsion to the unemployed who are suitable for service intheA.M.P.C.(d) To call up young men below the age of 20 for service in the A.M.P.C.(e) To allow young men in the age groups 18-19 fo enlist voluntarily intothe A.M.P.C.10. The classes affected by the above proposals fall into 3 groups, viz.:  (a) men within the age limit for Army classes, but below the presentminimum age for voluntary enlistment into the A.M.P.C.;(6) young men between the ages of 18-20 who are legally liable for com-pulsory military service; but the late Secretary of State gave an assurance to the House that, if possible, before sending out of thecountry any such men called up under the Act, he, or his successor,would make a statement to the House explaining the circumstances which rendered the course necessary;(c) the unemployed who are outside the age groups so far called Up.11. As regards (a) and (6) of paragraph 9, men taken for the A.M.P.C.,whether from the Army classes or voluntarily, who are between the ages of 20and 35, would be found at the expense of other arms, and it is undesirable towithdraw more men of these ages than is absolutely necessary from combatantunits. To allow men of these groups to volunteer has the additionaldisadvantage that some of them might do so in order to avoid combatant service.Should this impression get abroad, it would give the A.M.P.C. a bad name ifmany joined in this way; if few joined, it would be ineffective.12. To apply compulsory powers to the unemployed in advance of the date when their age makes them liable for service (course (c) of paragraph 9) appearsto be open to political objections of so serious a nature that it may be ruled out as anything but a long-term remedy.13. As regards (d) of paragraph 9, it is estimated that, if young men were called up below the age of 20, about 340,000 would be available. This is far more than is required, and such a course would moreover involve the with-drawal of the undertaking given in Parliament and elsewhere that men called up under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act would not be sent to Franceunder the age of 20. In any case it would be advisable to limit the duty of this group to areas behind the front line.14. The voluntary enlistment of young men between the ages of 18 and 20(course (e) of paragraph 9) would be open to less objection. Such a step might also go a long way towards satisfying the demand for an outlet for this age group of which some 40,000 to 50,000 are unemployed. The numbers that wouldvolunteer for service in labour units are uncertain, but it is quite likely thatthey would come forward in considerable numbers. This solution would be unsatisfactory only if it failed to produce at least 27,000 by the end of august and to provide a steady 5,000 a month thereafter. As these young men will betransferred to combatant duties later, somewhat larger numbers will subse-quently be necessary. Moreover, in order to enable the Divisions temporarilylent to the British Expeditionary Force (paragraph 8) to be withdrawn to com-plete their training in England, an initial block of 16,000 will be required.15. Thus there is a possibility that our whole problem may be solved bythe voluntary enlistment of the 18 and 19 year-old classes, and I ask for authorityto proceed accordingly. If, however, this is not successful, then some more drastic course will become essential, for the British Expeditionary Force in
France cannot carry on its task without these large labour forces. The cabinet will recollect that it rejected on political grounds an earlier suggestion to recruitChinese for this purpose. &quot;;j16. On the assumption that the Cabinet approve my policy I attach(Annex I) a draft of the statement which I should propose to make to the Houseof Commons. I also attach (Annex II) a note of the lines on which we should propose to deal with these young recruits to the A.M.P.C.O.F.G.S.The War Office,13th March, 1940.
ANNEX IAs the House is aware, the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps was formed in October last toprovide the necessary labour to carry out defensive and other works in areas of operations. Hithertoit has been recruited from men between the ages of 35 and 50, but it is now quite clear that theseage groups will not furnish the numbers or quality of men who will be required during the next.12 months to look no further ahead. In France especially a very large amount of unskilled and active labour is needed to carry out the concrete work, the construction of roads, railways,aerodromes, camps, stores and so forth, which are required by our continually increasing Armyin the field. And all this work must be carried out with the- least possible interference with the readiness of the fighting formations to carry out any tasks that may confront them.In order to meet this need, I propose to draw upon two sources. In the first place portions of Divisions which in the ordinary course would not be sent overseas for some time will besent to France in the near future where they will be able to combine their training with labourduties. The personnel concerned will include a certain number of men under the of of 19, butthey will all be employed in areas well behind the front line. In due course they will return tothis country to complete their training before proceeding overseas with their Divisions.In the second place, I propose to invite voluntary enlistment into the Auxiliary MilitaryPioneer Corps for service overseas from men now between 18 and 20 years of age. As the house is aware the men in the 18 and 19 year groups are not yet being called up under the NationalService (Armed Forces) Act, and the problem of finding occupation for many of these young menhas been an acute one. I have every hope, therefore, that extensive advantage will be taken ofthis offer. Men who join under this arrangement will be formed into companies under the command of specially selected officers, and will be treated not as ordinary members of Pioneer units, but asmen who will shortly be taking their places in Training Centres at home when they reach the age for so doing. They will in no way prejudice their chances of eventually getting into the unitsof their choice by undertaking this preliminary labour work, and they will find later on thatthe time they have spent in France before going out to fight will have been of very great value to them.ANNEX II1. The employment of young men of the 18-19 age group by voluntary enlistment in the auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps involves problems of wider scope than the ordinary enlistment of older men which is proceeding at present. These young men are at an impressionable age.Not only do they form the future sources of combatant soldiers for the Army but they are thefuture manhood of England, and it is recognized that a special responsibility attaches to theirenlistment in the Pioneer Corps.2. It is proposed that special steps should be taken to ensure a high morale among the youngmen, to broaden their outlook and to encourage the formation of judgment and independence underdiscipline, to foster a spirit of comradeship and esprit de corps, and to improve their physique.3. They will be enlisted under military law and discipline and given uniform and equipment,but will be unarmed.   They will receive the pay and allowances of a private soldier.4. They will be formed into companies of 280 men in accordance with the usual AuxiliaryMilitary Pioneer Corps establishment, and those who show a gift for leadership will have theopportunity of promotion to N.C.O., though a proportion of the N.COs. will be drawn from oldermen. The company will be commanded by an experienced Army officer over 40 years of age, andthe other officers will be specially chosen for the purpose from men with experience of handlingyoung men.5. They will be trained to answer the word of command in simple drill, taught march discipline,anti-gas drill, camp discipline and routine, and a proportion will receive training in stores and officework, sanitation, cooking, etc.6. When they are overseas, they will be employed in areas remote from the front line. special steps will be taken, compatible with the efficient execution of the work allotted to them, to allowtime for a certain amount of physical exercise, games, etc., and they will be encouraged to study and read in their spare time.(b40/8)   60   3/40  w.o.p.   4843
