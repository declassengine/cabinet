I have since arranged to present my conclusions on theshipping problem in a series of separate documents, eachdealing with a particular aspect.

r^QQES,CARRJ^D^NjTHE NORWEGIAN ROUTE,Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1.     At the meeting of the War Cabinet held on the 25thJanuary, the War Cabinet invited me to prepare a report inconjunction with the Ministers concerned,  on the subject ofthe cargoes carried by ships on the Norwegian route(War Cabinet 23 (40), conclusion 2).      I accordingly submitthis report, which has been agreed by the Minister of Supplyand the Minister of Shipping,2.      The First Lord of the Admiralty had stated at that meeting that, according to the analysis he had had made, outof a total of 107 cargoes carried by British ships in convoyon the Norwegian route since the 23rd December, 1939, theprincipal items were as follows:-Pulp (31) and Paper (5^) 36^ ships.General Cargo 29       &quot;Ballast 24 &quot;Ore 6       &quot;Timber 5%      &quot;These 107 ships were presumably comprised in the threeBergen Convoys numbers H.N.6. H.N.7.  and H.N.8.      Two furtherconvoys H.N.9A. and H.N.9B, have since arrived.      The totalnumber of vessels in those five convoys was 180 with a totalgross tonnage of 276,910 tons.      The convoys did not include any of the ships engaged in bringing iron ore from Narvik.Such ships arc. practically all British.     For the time being&quot;they are sailing independently.      They have proceeded in ballast in view of the special character of the trade and the urgent necessity of bringing the maximum quantities of iron ore to this country.      This for the present will continue.The Norwegian coal import should, in the opinion of the Ministryof Shipping, be taken care of by the smaller-Norwegian tonnagesuited to the trade.      At the moment there are 50 British shipsrequisitioned for Narvik ore with an approximate deadweightcapacity of 347,000 tons.3.      The following table gives details of the five convoys and of the principal commodities carried:

4.The main reason for the ships coming in ballastis as follows: -(a)    Since the outbreak of war there have beenvery heavy shipments of coal from theUnited Kingdom to Norway, the figure being -784,000 tons during the months September/December 1939  (as compared with 442,000 tonsin the corresponding period of 1938), i.e.an average of 196,000 tons a month.      this traffic could only be done if Scandinavian shipscame for the coal,(b)   There are limited amounts of essential supplies to be shipped from Southern Norwayto the United Kingdom.principal items with which they are concerned and for whichNorwegian currency ought to be paid, the monthly shipmentsin time of war should be as shown in the second column ofthe following table.      The third column shows the quantities carried in the convoys referred to above butreduced to a monthly basis and corrected to correspond withthe estimated deadweight tonnage of the ships concerned.1. 2. 3.Commodities. Estimated imports^ Imports deduced5.The Ministry of Supply estimated that of the from convoyfigures.(in &apos;000 tons per month).Wood pulp.Paper.Timber.Various metals andore.2561680*7.5.13730Our total estimated monthly requirements of importedwood pulp are about 1409000 tons.  (Almost all of it co.iesfrom Scandinavian and Baltic StatesJ*

The heavy increases in the third column for pulp and metals reflect therefore the practices adopted &quot;by Swedishexporters of railing goods to Norway or of sending their ships inside territorial waters to join Bergen Convoys.Subject to this &quot;the figures go to show the paucity of essential imports which can be drawn from Southern Norway-     There are,in addition, small amounts of certain foodstuffs and miscellaneous goods, but these would not aggregate more thana few thousand tons a month.6.       All the vessels in the last four outward convoys havebeen loaded with cargo.     These convoys are much smaller thanthe homeward convoys, the aggregate tonnage of the vesselsbeing 61,000 tons gross.     Of this shipping, 29,000 tonscarried coal, 16,000 tons arms to Finland and 16,000 tonscarried manganese ore or general cargo.      It is evident fromthese figures that most of the neutrals have preferred to go backindependently, rather than wait for homeward convoy.7.       Any proposal to bring pressure to bear on all neutral vessels to bring cargoes to the United Kingdom raisesquestions of policy and the matter is being considered separately by the Ministry of Shipping.      It should be noted,however, that under Shipping Agreements the Norwegians andSwedes are entitled to the same treatment as Britishshippers as regards bunker facilities etc  so long as theyfulfil their obligations to this country.     The SwedishAgreement obliges Swedish shipowners to provide tonnage forthe trade between Sweden and the United Kingdom, includingSwedish trade through non-Swedish ports such as Narvik.The Norwegian Agreement contains no such specificobligation as regards trade between Norway and the UnitedKingdom but the Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Association havegiven an assurance that they will constantly endeavour to

secure that vessels proceeding from Norway to the UnitedKingdom to load coal for the return voyage should carrycargo from Norway instead of sailing in ballastsNegotiations are proceeding with both the Norwegiansand the Swedes with the object of bringing some norwegian and Swedish ships into the Narvik ore trade.       But owingto the long ballast voyage involved between Bergen or   Osloand Narvik and the special risks attaching to the trade inpresent circumstances, it is hardly to be expected that allthe Norwegian and Swedish ships coming to this countryfor coal will be available to bring cargoes of ore from Narvik.It should, nevertheless, be possible to get some norwegian and Swedish ships into the trade though this would involvethe use of more ships to carry the required monthly amountof coal to Norway0.8a       Statistics of the cargoes carried by British ships to Norway in recent months are not readily available, as the voyage is not subject to licence;    but as only 11 british ships were included in the return convoys the cargoescarried to Norway by British ships cannot have beensubstantialo      Moreover,  as already indicated, british ships going to Narvik for ore are sailing direct in ballastas,  owing to the urgent necessity for obtaining all possiblesupplies of iron ere from Narvik by the end of March (forwhich purpose all available British ships have been directedinto the trade) it is not possible to contemplate the delay and consequent loss of ore which would be incurred if someof the ships in the trade were allowed to take cargoes to southern Norway and thence proceed in ballast to Narviko

9. This examination of the matter has shown that thereason why so many of the convoyed ships sailed in ballastwas that they were coming to this country for coal whichwe wanted to sell but for which we could not spare theships and that the incoming cargo from Norway was insufficient to fill the space.      But although it isnot considered that the proportion of neutral shipsmaking voyages in ballast from Norway to the UnitedKingdom is unduly high, the Minister of Shippingwill continue to take, consistent with general policy,all practicable steps with the object of inducing anyneutral ships which would otherwise make voyages in ballast from Norway to the United Kingdom to carrycargoes of Commodities required by this country and,in particular iron ore from Narvik.10. A note by the Mines Department is attached regardingthe export of British coal to Norway.(Intld)   A.R.D.Board of Trade.5th February/, 1940.

ANNEX.GOAL EXPORTS TO NORVA.Y ^Md&apos; NQRWEGXrJj .SH.shipping.notes by Mines Department.United Kingdom coal exports to Norway have proceededsince the outbreak of War at the average rate of about196,000 tons per month.      (We have, of course,  encouragedneutrals to take as much coal as possible in order to keepour pits working.)    This is considerably above normal and isbelieved to be due to the desire of the Norwegian Governmentand consumers to lay down stocks.     Norway has undertaken,under The Trade Agreement of 1933, to take 70% of her coal imports from the United Kingdom and this normally representsupwards of 1-g- million tons.     There is in addition aconsiderable export of coke- (400,-000 tons in 1938).      It would therefore probably be reasonable to put the average Norwegianrequirement of coal and coke together from the United kingdom at 2 million tons per .annum.      This is in present circumstances-a minimum figure, having regard to (a) the norwegian government stocking policy,  (b) the difficulty of obtaining supplies from other sources.      Detailed figures are notavailable, but such information as can be extracted at short notice suggests that practically the whole of this exportsave for odd eargoes to small ports and bunkering depots -goes to Norwegian destinations South of Trondjhem.There is under the Trade Agreement of 1935 an impliedobligation on the United Kingdom to maintain the suppliesnecessary to enable the 70% figure to be achieved.      In theproposed War Trade Agreement, it is likely that this obligation would be expressed more definitely.Practically all this coal and coke is carried in norwegian ships.      If the tonnage of these ships were reduced,by refusing to accept.ships ooming in ballast it would follow that the coal and coke exports would bo reduced correspondingly -

or by about 500,000 tons per annum - present va.lue about 650,000 fc0cbo    Bather more than half this loss would fall onNorthumberland and Durham, rather more than a quarter on theMidland coal fields, and the balance on East Scotland.Separate figures for time lost at the collieries in east Scotland are not availablet    But Northumberland, durham and the Midlands are precisely the coal fields where thegreatest amount of idle time is being suffered.    This has beenthe case ever since the beginning of the Far and is almostentirely due to lack of chipping (export and coastwise) to liftthe available output.    This lost time, which is particularlyacute in Northumberland, not only represents the loss ofvaluable coal production, but it leads to suspicion thatGovernment policy is favouring other coal fields, and it hasunfortunate repercussions on the labour situation (accentuated by the fact that the North East Coast coal fields are relatively low wage areas).    The idle time on the North East Coast and in&apos;the Midlands has already attracted Parliamentary attention on more than one occasion^The loss of 500, 000 tons of trade a year representsapproximately the loss of a full year&apos;s work for 2,000 men.It must be emphasised that any loss of trade to Norwaythrough reduction of the available Norwegian Shipping isabsolute loss - i,e. it cannot be made up by increased sales in other directions because other shipping tonnage is notavailable.    In the particular districts concerned to an even greater extent than in the United Kingdom as a whole, there isample productive capacity to meet the full demand now beingmade on them.    The total of that demand, so far as export isconcerned is limited by the available shipping, allied and neutral.   Any reduction in the available Norwegian shippingymeans a reduction in the total shipping available, and therefore a corresponding reduction in the total shipment of coal.Mines Department,,2nd February, 1940. ...8--
