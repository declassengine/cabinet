C R E T. COPY NO.   /J.P.(G.)  (40) 93Anril 2nd,I940. WAR        CABINETMEMORAirotJM BY THE MINISTER OF economic warfare.French Proposals for Rationing&apos;Neutrals.1, Monsieur Monnet, the new French Blockade Minister,is coining to London on the 5t&apos;h&apos; April with a view todiscussing with me the tightening up of the contraband control, with special reference to the rationing neutrals.     The Supreme War Council passed a resolution on the subject &quot;that the French and British authoritiesshould undertake an examination into the possibilityof making the blockade more effective by imposing quotason such neutral countries as might be thought necessary&quot;.The French Mission appear to have been informed by their ministers that the Supreme War Council, in passing this resolution, accepted the principle of rationing and that only the machinery&apos;was referred for discussion to the experts;    but I propose to interpret the resolution as requiring us to study the possibilities rather than toapply a decision already taken.2, The French Mission have recently sent us three   jnotes on the subject.(i) The first of these notes, which is accompaniedby a lengthy historical memorandum,  suggests that theAllied Governments should select a certain number of

commodities essential for war purposes, fix the amounts which neutral countries should he allowed for theirown purposes and proceed to detain and even to seizeconsignments of these commodities whenever there was reason to believe that part of them might be going tobe sent to the enemy in violation of the War trade agreements,    The French memorandum suggested that thispolicy might be inaugurated in our relations v/ithBelgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the scandinavian countries &quot;either by giving a different orientationto negotiations still in progress or else through theinterpretation of the Agreements already concluded&quot;.This note only makes a brief reference to Italy.    Itstates that &quot;there were very definite political factors to be taken into account, but the continually increasingfigures of Italy&quot;s oil imports showed the necessity fortightening our control measures&quot;..(ii) This proposal is more fully devolped in the second note which, after pointing out the very high figures of Italian oil imports, suggests that theAllied Governments should at once approach the ItalianGovernment for a full and frank explanation of these imports and of the future programme with a view to someamicable rationing scheme.    If, on the other hand, theItalians refuse this, then &quot;the Allied Governments havegrounds for refusing further guarantees and detainingthe ships until the required assurances and explanationsare given&quot;.(iii) The third note proposes an extension ofthe navicert system which, at the moment, is only functioningfor a very limited number of countries; navicerts would

be issued up to the amount of the permissible ration ofany country&apos;s imports, but, at the same time,  it would be announced that all goods not accompanied by navicerts wouldbe liable to be detained and even unloaded for inquiry.3. The possibilities of rationing depend a gooddeal on the circumstances of each of the various countries concerned.      There are,  in fact, three main groups ofadjacent neutrals:(a) the Northern neutrals, with whom we have concluded War Trade   Agreements:(b) Russia and Italy, where there appears little prospect of arranging any effective War trade agreements:(c) The Balkan countries, whose overseas importswe can control to whatever extent may be necess-ary to prevent re-export to Germany, but whosupply Germany mainly with their own domesticproducts which cannot be stopped by any contra-band control but only by pre-emptive purchasing,h. The main French note proposes to ration the first group of countries, viz., Belgium, the Netherlands,Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.      We have con-cluded V:/ar Trade Agreements with all these countries exceptSwitzerland, where the negotiations are well advanced but no agreement has yet been made.     These War Trade Agreementsall j)rovide -(a) that the neutral will totally prohibit theexport of the more important war materialsimported from overseas both to belligerents

and. to neutrals, except in a few cases whereexport to safe neutrals is allowed;(b)      that the neutral will limit the export to theenemy of certain other goods,  including domesticproduce,  to certain agreed quantities;(o)      that passage of goods through the contraband control will be facilitated, subject to ageneral reservation of belligerent rights.5.      These War Trade Agreements can be criticised intwo respects.    In the first place,  it can be argued thatthe Agreement obliges us to rely upon the good faith of theneutral Government concerned and its ability to enforce itsdomestic regulations enacted in connection with theAgreement.   The fact, however, that the neutral governments have imposed prohibitions on export is an Important safe-guard as it means that German agents have to evade not onlyour Contraband Control but also the domestic legislation of the neutral country concerned.     In most cases theAgreements have been concluded so recently that there hasnot yet been time to see how they work, but there is no evidence to suggest insincerity on the part of the neutral governments concerned.    On the other hand, we cannot besure that with our present means of obtaining informationwe shall rapidly obtain proof that the Agreements arebeing fully observed or are effective.     Our War trade agreements, however, contain a clause enabling us to terminate them at short notice should it be found thata neutral Government is not acting fairly by us or thatthe Agreement is ineffective; and, of course, none of theWar Trade Agreements preclude us from intercepting consign-ments in respect of which we have any definite evidence of- h -

6. Secondly, it may be objected that the majorityof the present War Trade Agreements do not prevent neutral countries from accumulating large stocks of key commodities,some part of which may find their way sooner or later into germany.    This is true;    but there is nothing in theAgreements to prevent us from approaching neutrals with aview to obtaining their further agreement to limit their imports or their stocks.      Indeed,   in a number of theAgreements provisions are included which may be used asthe foundation for a rationing arrangement (see Appendix).I think that if further action is to be taken to restrict imports into these countries it should be our aim tofollow this line and to graft the rationing arrangements on the existing   War Trade Agreements rather than to give upthe valuable safeguards which these War Trade Agreements give us .7.        In the last resort, of course, there is nothing inthe ,r&apos;ar Trade Agreements which would, from a legal stand-point, prevent the imposition of a forcible rationing,although the size of the ration would have to be fixed with due regard to the terms of the Agreements unless these were first denounced.      Moreover,  it must be borne in mind thatthe Prize Court is not likely to condemn any cargoesseized unless evidence could be produced of enemy destin-ation or at least a very strong statistical case could bemade indicating a risk of such destination;    and such evidence would be difficult to adduce in regard to theneutral countries which prohibit the export of the commoditites-ities in question.    Meanwhile, any action taken to imposeforcible rationing unilaterally might well lead the neutral

Governments to denounce the War Trade Agreements ontheir side and. thereby obtain release from their under-takings to prohibit re-exports to Germany - which would create a far graver risk of supplies going to Germanythan any advantage that we would get from forciblerationing;.80    The smaller neutrals are the least difficult problem.     The main leaks in the blockade are probablythrough Russia and Italy, with whom we have not beenable to make any War Trade Agreements,    In the case ofRussia the Supreme War Council has already approvedproposals as to the action to be taken.9*    The case of Italy remains to be dealt with.The second French note proposes definite measures to limitItalian oil imports.    My information shows that theFrench are correct in holding the view that the stocksof oil held in Italy are already large and are increasingmonthlya    My colleagues will be interested in the relevantfigures.      Italy&apos;s petroleum stocks no1// stand at 2,6 million tons and, taking into account orders already placed, mayamount by the end of this year to 3*8 million tens - a much higher figure than that of any other neutral.     Moreover,Italy has not Imposed any prohibition on re-expo?:*t of oil to Germany and we have reason to believe that the guarantees which she has given In regard to the internal consumption in Italy of oil imports have not in all cases been implemented.    Were It not for the political objections,there can be no doubt whatever&quot; that a strong case cculdbe made out for rationing Italy1s oil imports.      I feel,however, that the political issues at stake in theadoption of a policy involving a rationing of Italy&apos;s oil imports are of such importance that, before acquiescing

in the French proposal, * it is incumbent on me toascertain the views of the Cabinet.      I would ask them,however, in considering the matter, to bear in mind the enormous difficulties involved in continueddiscrimination in favour of Italy where questions of contraband ipolicy are involved.      If we are prepared to ration small countries in respeot of certain commoditiesit is very difficult, if we are not to incur a charge of inconsistency and unfair discrimination, not to take similar action with Italy.       Moreover, it is clear that so long as Italy is able to import all commodities upto any quantity, there is bound to be a serious gap inany rationing arrangements made with Switzerland andcertain other neutrals.10.     Any decision in respect of Italian oil importsmust, of course, fit into the framework of our generalAllied policy towards Italy.     Hitherto our policy hasbeen to regard Italy as a thorn in the flesh and temperour Contraband policy towards her even at the risk ofincurring charges of unfair discrimination from otherneutrals.     In adopting this policy we have been guided by the motive of doing nothing likely unduly toantagonise Italy, but our leniency to Italy has notproduced, much in the way of return and the only definiteachievement, viz., the stoppage of German sea-bornecoal exports - was obtained by imposing our control andstopping the ships conveying this coal.     Similar action may be necessary in order to ration oil imports into italy.     Are His Majesty&apos;s    Government prepared to take this risk?11.   I imagine that the War Cabinet will not wish to

be rushed into giving any decision on this matter, andI would propose,  therefore,  in discussions with M. Monnet,to take the line that, while from the point of view ofeconomic warfare, we should be very glad to impose forciblerationing if political considerations permit, these polit-ical considerations transcend the scope of our blockadedepartments and will have to be&quot;the subject of discussion by the higher authorities of our Governments..    Meanwhile,I would.try to draw from M- Monnet some indication as tothe   French policy in this matter and report back.12.       As regards the Balkan States, rationing presentsless difficulties but as I have already said, thesecountries do not represent a very important source of imported raw materials.     The same is true of the smallerBaltic States.13.    As regards the machinery of rationing, we havealready taken action, with the approval of the WarCabinet, to negotiate rationing agreements in regard tocotton imports.      In this case, the Cabinet agreed thatwe should seek to secure import quotas by voluntaryagreements but authorised me, if necessary, to have recourse to forcible rationing.      Subject to what has been said before as regards the position in different countries,I am in favour of taking similar action in the case ofother commodities provided that this appears to be justified.I should, be glad, therefore,  to have authority to proceed in respect of other commodities on the lines already approved in the case of cotton.Ih.    There is, however, one difficulty which, we havealready experienced, with, the French.    While rationingagreements are not popular withneutrals

neutral countries, their objections are likely to relatenot so much to the principle of rationing as to theamount of the rationing.    The Attorney General has advisedus that &quot;if we wish to enforce forcible rationing it willhave to be shown that the ration figure covered theinternal needs of the country and legitimate trade, ifany, with other neutral countries, and also stocksreasonably held or required under existing war conditions&quot;.The neutral countries with whom we have had discussionsall point out that at the present time, when they are all engaged in rearmament programmes, their needs formany raw materials which enter into rearmament require-ments are considerably in excess of their normal imports;and further, that in view of the state of war it is of\ ........1the greatest importance to their economy to maintainadequate stocks of these and other raw materials.    TheFrench Government, however, tends to take the line thatthe ration should be fixed on the basis of some year inthe past and are extremely reluctant to admit of any allowance for increased requirements.     I do not think thatthe French attitude in this matter, desirable though itmay well be from the point of view of economic warfare, canbe regarded as reasonable, and I think that in fixing the ration we must take careful account of the case presented bythe neutral countries concerned for increased allowances.I should be glad to know that this policy, has the approvalof the War Cabinet.15.    Finally, there are the French proposals in regardto the navicert system.    There is, of course, no objectionto the proposal that the navicert system should be extended

to other consignor countries than those North and south american countries in which it is now operating.    Indeed?steps have already been taken with a view to theextension of the system to the remainder of the american continent, as well as to certain other countries.    I am advised, however, that&apos;the further French proposal, forthe unloading of un-navicerted cargo merely because it isun-navicerted, would be of very doubtful legality.Navicerts are merely a convenience which we offer to neutral shippers and the fact that goods may be shipped .without a navicert does not constitute evidence thatthey are destined to the enemy.    Moreover, such action would almost certainly give rise to difficulties in theUnited States, where the State Department have recentlybeen given certain assurances regarding the manner inwhich the navicert system, will be used.    It would bedifficult in any case to justify the compulsorydischarge of items of un-navicerted cargo unless we could put forward some special circumstances of suspicion and show that an adequate investigation and examination ofthe items could not be affected unless they were unloaded.It would probably be better in such cases to cause delay and inconvenience to the ship rather than to the cargoowner.       The ship could for instance be detained whileitems were being examined.    Another possible line wouldbe to withdraw hold-back facilities in cases where a ship!s navicert might have been, but was not, obtained.16.      I propose therefore -(i)   to agree that we should seek tot graft rationing arrangements of commodities of special importance on to the War Trade Agreementsv/ith the neutral scountries.

2nd April, 19h0.with which we have concluded these agreements, without, however, pressingthem so far as to provoke the denunciation of these Agreements:(ii) To point out to Ivl. Monnet the political difficulties involved in any attempt to ration Italy and to refer &quot;back to theCabinet for further instructions on thispoint:(iii) To propose the adoption of the procedurealready authorised in regard torationing of cotton imports, viz. thatwe should seek to fix quotas by agreement,but failing agreement, be empowered toenforce rationing, the quotas for thispurpose being fixed, on a basis which takes full account of all legitimate needsof the countries concerned:(iv) To explain the objections to makingnavicerts compulsory and to the detention of all un-navicerted cargo.R.H.C .

APPENDIX.Sweden:We are in process of agreeing with, the Swedishauthorities a list of their requirements of the moreimportant commodities for 1940 on the understandingthat we will limit their imports of each commodity fromall sources to the quantities agreed.Norway;The Norwegian Government have declared their intention to limit stocks or certain specified commodities to an agreed figure.    They have also declared their intention, subject to constituting these stocks, to limit imports of the commodities in question to theactual consumption thereof in Norway and such quantitiesas may be exported to the other Scandinavian countries.They have also agreed to institute a system of importlicences for certain commodities on the list.   From these undertakings to an agreement on the actual amounts of the commodities which may be imported is only a small step.Denmark:The Danish Agreement contains an article in whichthe Danish Government announce their intention of maintaining an import control over a list of specified commodities limiting the issue of import licences for thosecommodities so that the prescribed quantities shall notbe exceeded.    There are also detailed arrangements limit-ing Danish imports of mineral oils and foodstuffs.

^5 O6 OBaltic States; . .Negotiations are in progress with a LatvianDelegation, the main principle of which is that Latviashould limit her imports of specified commodities toagreed figures.     Similar negotiation&quot;: are contemplatedfor Estonia and Lithuania.Switzerland;There is a hint of rationing in the openingsentence of the draft Swiss declaration which reads as follows:&quot;The Swiss Government, desirous of safeguarding the vital interests of Switzerland, of maintainingher traditional neutrality and of ensuring the entry into the Swiss customs territory of quantitiesof raw materials and commodities sufficient tosatisfy the needs of national defence and thesupply of the population  ...........&quot; &apos;   -We also specifically reserve our belligerent rights inthe case of imports into Switzerland being so abnormallylarge as to constitute a presumption of contraband.    Inaddition, the Swiss have furnished us unofficially withfigures of their requirements for 19u1.     Though these are considered in some cases too high, the fact of theirhaving been furnished affords a basis for agreedrationing figures.     It seems highly desirable to go ahead with agreeing such figures as soon as the War trade agreement has been signed. By consent between.our twoGovernments prior to the outbreak of the war, it was arranged that the French Government should be responsible

for negotiations with the Swiss Government;    we would,like to assume therefore that the French will themselvessafeguard in this negotiation the principles by whichthey appear to set such store.Holland and Belgium;In the case of Holland and Belgium, the War trade agreements contain no provision about limiting imports and I would see no objection to asking these governments to fix their .own import quotas for the most important commodities,  and to discussing with them the dangers of allowing excessive stocks to accumulate..
