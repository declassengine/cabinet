&apos;  *ACQUISITION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND by service DEPARTMENTS,  INCLUDING THEMINISTRY OF supply memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries. In continuation of the Memorandum which I circulated on the 29th March, 1940, W.P.  (g)  (40) 90,I desire to state that officials of my Department havehad an opportunity of discussing with officials of theAir Ministry the future programme relating to theprovision of sites for and construction of aerodromesreferred to in paragraph 9 of that memorandum.2. My Department is now informed that so far as can be foreseen the Air Ministry will require altogetherin addition to the cases which have already been referredto my Department under the existing liaison procedure,about 150 aerodromes for operational and training purposes in this country or abroad,  and that of these they hope toput 50 abroad.      Of the 100 required at home, 50 will bemain aerodromes needing buildings from 500 to 600 acreseach, while 50 will be subsidiary aerodromes of 300 to400 acres .each, making a total of 40,000 to 50,000 acres in all.      About 20 or 30 of these 100 aerodromes will bereqiiired for operational purposes and situate east of aline running roughly through the Pennines, Birmingham toSouthampton.      The remaining 70 to 80 will be west of theSECRETW.P.   (G.)   (40)  97.APRIL 5th,  1940. COPY NO.      /ZWAR; CABINET

line,  if possible, but it is hoped to find 9 or 10aerodromes in Scotland.        It is understood that inaddition,  two or three factories will have to be provided,with aerodromes,  of areas of 500 to 600 acres each, whilethe &quot;non-flying&quot; requirements of the Air Ministry willprobably mean the acquisition of a further 2,000 acres,3o The Air Ministry state that all the above figures,apart from the &quot;non-flying&quot; requirements of 2,000 acres,must be taken to relate to good agricultural land required;for use as early as possible, and this was to some extentforeseen when I set out in paragraph 4 of my previous memorandum the requirements of the Air Ministry in regardto their aerodromes and landing-grounds which rule out of consideration the acquisition of land on the light sandysoils and on the heavy clays which constitute second orthird rate agricultural l.&amp;r.idc4. The Air Ministry have further stated that thetraining aerodromes to be located in this country will be largely for (icperational training and cannot be locatedabroad because this training must be carried out under the weather conditions in which operations will take xALace.5, My Department is informed that the requirementsset out above are an essential part of the Royal AirForce war programme which has already been approved by theGovernment, but I consider it essential to set out the implications of that programme so far as agriculture and food production are concernedo6-. The Air Ministry requirements will result in the diversion of some 50,000 acres from food production.      an even more serious result will be the withdrawal of further large numbers of men from food production for theconstruction of the proposed aerodromes and buildings.The supply of agricultural &quot;labour which was serious before

the outbreak of war has been rendered still more graveby tho loss of men to the armed forces and the still greater and continuing attraction of skilled agricultural workers away from farms to the construction of the aerodromes, military camps and munition factories sitedin rural districts.    It is estimated that some 75,000men will have left the land between the outbreak of warand the end of 1940.7, Although it is impossible, until the sites ofthe new aerodromes are actually selected,  to obtain anyreliable figure as to the volume of labour that will berequired for levelling and for constructional works,  itmay perhaps be very roughly - but conservatively -estimated that for each aerodrome at least some 50 to 100men would be required for a period of several months inunskilled work of a type which would attract agricultural labour from surrounding farms because the wages payablewould - as is usual - substantially exceed agricultural wages.    It is to be expected, therefore, that one resultof the Air Ministry&apos;s programme will be to draw away from agriculture a substantial proportion of the 5,000 to 10,000unskilled workers who will be required for constructionalpurposes.    This will undoubtedly have a serious effect upon the fulfilment of the Government&apos;s food production programme which is already seriously jeopardised by theshortage of skilled workers.6. This does not, however, represent the full effecton the agricultural labour position if considerable numbersof men formerly employed on farms are attracted away toconstructional work.    Not only will they continue torequire accommodation in the   neighbourhood, but the furtherinflux of tradesmen and unskilled workers will also makedemands on housing facilities, which are already inadequatein most rural areas.    The result will be not only that

agriculture will lose its men, but also that there will   notbe available accommodation for   substitutes, even if thosesubstitutes could be found.9. The agricultural community have been urged tomake the utmost effort to produce more food as a   vitalcontribution to national defence.       If in a hundred rural districts good agricultural land (on much of which special efforts will have been made and crops will be growing) istaken by the Air Ministry and skilled labour is withdrawnfrom the farms where the shortage is already such that farmers are finding it very difficult to carry on theeffect will be widespread criticism and exasperation with serious repercussions on the further home production offood.     If it is decided that the Air Ministry&apos;s programmecannot be modified and that their requirements must haveprecedence over food production then I suggest that it isessential that this decision should be fully and publiclyexplained, and in particular that it should be stated thatwe have reached a point where we cannot find sites except on good agricultural land.     I would also suggest that special steps should be taken to import into the districts where the aerodromes are to be sited all the extra labour required.10. A statement such as is proposed.in the preceding paragraph is especially necessary if my Department is toco-operate, as the Air Ministry wish, in the search forand selection of sites to carry out their programme.     MyDepartment and my officers throughout the country are engaged in promoting the utmost expansion of foodproduction., and it would be impossible for themsuccessfully to fulfil this function if they were to be associated with the selection of good agricultural landfor withdrawal from food production unless the necessityfor this course had been made clearly known to

agriculturists toy some definite Government announcementstating that, having regard to the overriding necessities of the Royal Air Force in regard to the successful prosecution of the war, some modification of the principlesannounced by the Prime Minister in his letter toLord Herbert in February, 1938, must be made.11. I would desire to add that whatever decision isreached on the Air Ministry&apos;s programme of aerodromeconstruction in my view a Priority Board of&apos; the kindsuggested in my previous memorandum would still be desirablefrom the point of vie?/ of both the Ministry of Agricultureand the Service Departments for adjudicating where differences of opinion arose on the acquisition of sites for purposes other than aerodromes, where the acquisition of good agricultural land, is not really essential to the acquiringDepartments requirements, and. perhaps also for certainborderline cases where land is required for non-operationalaerodromes.12. It is, therefore, suggested -(i)    that if the Air Ministry&apos;s programme involving the acquisition of agricultural land cannot be modified, the Government should issiie anannouncement stating that the requirements forair offence and defence will, necessarily,involve interference with food production;(ii)    that even if the Air Ministry programme iscarried out, it would still be desirable thata Priority Board of the nature indicated in my previous Memorandum of the 29th March, 1940,W.P.   (G)  (40) 90, and in paragraph 11 of thisMemorandum.

13. For convenience of presentation this Memorandumhas been prepared by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, but the Secretary of State for Scotlanddesires to associate himself entirely with it.(Itld.)   R.H.D-S.6.
