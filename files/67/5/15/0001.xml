S S C R E T GOFY NOW.P. (G.) (UO)65.WAR      C A B I n E TNORWEGIAN WAR TRADE AGREEMENT.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of economic warfare.February 27th, 1940.

NORWEGIAN WAR TRADE AGREEMENT.. I circulate herewith, to the Cabinet a paper explaining the circumstances in which I have authorised the conclusion ofa War Trade Agreement with Norway,  and would he glad to know that I have Cabinet approval for my action.The matter is referred to the Cabinet solely for thereason that, under certain aspects,  this agreement does not secure such favourable terms as I could wish.      Under its terms the Norwegian Government may continue to accumulateconsiderable stocks of cereals and mineral oils, but theNorwegian Government insist that such stocks are necessary tosafeguard their people from possible shortages,  and there is noquestion of their re-export in any form to Germany.    I had alsohoped that it would be possible to secure considerable reductionsas compared with peace-time levels in the exports to Germany ofa number of Norwegian domestic products in which Germany isdeficient.    In fact, we have secured some reductions in regardto iron ore and copper and a very large reduction in regard towhale oil, but in the case of fresh fish we. have had to agree tosome increase over the normal level of exports.      During theGreat War we succeeded in reducing substantially Norwegianexports of fish by purchasing them ourselves but the Departmentsconcerned are not prepared to undertake such purchases now,except as regards whale oil.The agreement guarantees that no restrictions will beplaced on our purchases of timber,  pulp?  aluminium,  zinc, nickeland ferro-alloys, which latter are essential for our rearmamentprogrammeo      We have also secured under the agreement thatGermany will receive practically none of these ferro-alloys.The Agreement will, moreover, only come into force on condition that the Shipping Agreement,   to which great importance isattached,  is implemented without delay.The negotiations/

27tb February, 19h0,The negotiations reached a critical stage in the middleof this month v/hen it was clear that the Norwegians had madeall the concessions which they dared to meet out^demands andwhen Germany, who had been engaged on similar negotiations at Oslo for some months was pressing the Norwegians for final decisions,,      The time had,  therefore,  come when we had todecide whether to take the best War Trade Agreement we could get or break off negotiations,.      The latter course would have involved the full exercise of our belligerent rights v/ith allthe resultant friction and deterioration of our relations with Norway, alone of the Scandinavian Powers.      It would have,  inall probability, involved also forcible rationing, failure toobtain the ferro-alloys and other supplies which we need, and,still more important,   the risk of denunciation and in any casea renewed delay in the implementation of the Shipping agreement by the Norwegian Government.In these circumstances and as it was necessary to informthe Norwegian Government of our decision, I telegraphed to our representative in Oslo,  informing him that I approved the war trade Agreement in principle,   subject to revision of text andthe conclusion of a Payments Agreement satisfactory to us.I may add that the French Government who were at firstinclined to be rather critical of the Agreement have now accepted it fully and asked that its terms should be extendedto prance0RcH.C.

Prc-pos-e-d War Trade Agreement with Norway.The propos&quot;ed^War Trad^uJLgreement with Nor-way^pre^eni-s the-^awba-ck -that they will &quot;be allowed.to accumulate considerable stocks,particularly of cereals and mineral,, oils. Nor will the export of norwegian domestic products to Germany be materially reducedcompared with the pre-war total, excluding whale oil.On the other hand- I am satisfied that their desire to buildup these stocks is chiefly through fear that aerial attacks on shipping and unrestricted submarine warfare may seriously inter-fere with their iinports, rather than to become economicallyindependent of us.    Moreover, under the terms of the War trade agreement the Norwegian Government have undertaken not to re-export any of these commodities to any destination,i feel satisfied too that we have pressed them as far asthey dare go at the present time and that we can obtain no more so long as they fear Germany and cling to neutrality.The advantages which will accrue to us are that no restrictionswill be placed ..r. the quantities which we mar&quot; purchase of timber,pulps  aluminium., sine., nickel and f erro-allcys, which latter are essential for our armament programme.    Norway will also undertaketo co-operate with us in the control   f contraband by prohibiting the transhipment; - r reexport to any destination of a list of imported key c rinmodities in any form or an:/ products or deriva-tives thereof.      This prrhib-.it-; ;r. will also extend to allarticles manufac om e 1 in Norway v/hich contain more than 12-gfJ ofthese c omm o d iti es.None of those commodities etc, can be exported without a licence, and a Joint Commission will be appointed, composed of equal numbers of Norwegian and British v^ric:^;&quot;1, Wtoc for m^-ingrecommend &apos;   :-r- as to the strict carrying out of the Agreement.The Norwegian Govc.::r,c&quot;\f harp rrxd^rtaken to accord to theCommission all reasonable facilities which it may require forcarrying out its duties,Norway will also restrict the sxport of domestic products toGermany to the peace-time level,,  In some cases such products will

be still further restricted or even prohibited, with the exceptionof fresh fish. They will &quot;os permitted to import sufficient whaleoil for Scandinavian consumption but the balance of their Antarticcatch will be sold to H.M.Government,As a condition of signing the War Trade Agreement, I have alsostipulated that the Shipping Agreement be fully implemented withoutdelay.    In this regard, the Norwegian Government have protestedthat they cannot take official cognisance of the Shipping Agreementor force the shipowners to implement it, They have, however, agreedto inform H,M.Representative,Oolo-that they will use their best endeavours to persuade the Norwegian Shipowners Association to implement:- the Agreement and will not put any obstacle in their way which might prevent them from doing so.  I have little doubt thatthe promised ships will be forthcoming and have reserved the rightto denounce the War Trade Agreement should we be disappointed.The German representatives expressed keen disappointment at therestriction of their supplies and, as some compensation for whatthey have lost, pressed Norway &quot;to increase their exports to them of fresh fish above oho peaae-time level.    They coupled this demandwith a threat not to deliver to Norway ho anti-aircraft gins and150,000 shells which they had promised to supply by March and whichNorway urgently requires.Norway is anxious to meet the German demands and it was,therefore, agreed to allow her to expert to Germany an additional quantity of 50,000 tons of fresh fish against the delivery of the guns and ammunition, This quantity of fish represents about I-g- lbs.per head of the German population,I feel satisfied that Norway is chiefly anxious to obtain the guns rather than to sell the extra fish, as she cannot buy them from Italy, America   r ourselves.,    At the some time, it was pointedcut that she wished to purchase her security at our expense, and in recognition of this the Norwegian Government have undertaken to procure that 10 additional tankers will be made available to us

under the Shipping Agreement,5.    Germany has been pressing Norway for some months for a finalanswer and their representatives were in Oslo for that purpose.The time had, therefore, come when we had to decide whether totake the best War Trade Agreement we could get or break offnegotiations. The latter course would have involved the fullexercise of our belligerent rights with all the resultantfriction and deterioration of our relations with Norway, alone ofthe Scandinavian Powers.  It would have, in all probability, invol-ved also forcible rationing, failure to obtain the ferro-alloysand other supplies which we need and, still more important, the breakdown of the Shipping Agreement.In these circumstances and as it v/as necessary to inform theNorwegian Government of cur decision, I telegraphed to our representative in Oslo, informing him that I approved the war trade Agreement in principle, subject to revision of text and theconclusion of a Payments Agreement satisfactory to us.There was also reason to hope that the conclusion of this war Trade Agreement, together with the smooth running of theShipping Agreement, would do much to improve relations betweenthe tw;- countries and might pave the way to closer co-operation and understanding in the future.6.    It should bo observed that the Agreement is only for 3 months andis subject to one month1s notice on either side; also, that my telegram approving the War Trade Agreement was sent on February la,and the Norwegian Government expressed the desire to initial it onFebruary 19, two days after the Alt-mark incident.In conclusion,  it should be recorded that, as evidence oftheir goodwill and in an endeavour to live up to their obligations,the Norwegian Government hove instructed tb*j cib&quot;&apos;owners Associati-on to take 10 ships off their regular lines in lieu of ordinarytramps and put them at our disposal under the Shipping Agreement,which represents considerable sacrifice.
