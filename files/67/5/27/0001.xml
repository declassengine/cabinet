MARCH. 1940.WAR CABINET.STANDARD CLOTHING.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I,      INTRODUCTORY,When on the 31st January last in reply to aquestion by Mr. Attlee in the House of Commons,. I made anannouncement of the Governments decision to regulate therise in the Cost of Living by bearing losses incurred bythe Ministry of Pood on the resale of foodstuffs, Mr.Attlee asked in the course of a supplementary question,,whether it was proposed to extend this policy to the otherstaple commodities outside the range of foodstuffs.    In myreply I said:-&quot;Then there are also some other items, of whichthe most important, and the most difficult todeal with perhaps, is the price of clothing,because clothing is so very variable.    Asregards that, I can inform the House &quot;that wehave been for some time very carefully examin-ing, through a special committee, the problemof how clothing might perhaps be dealt with.I am not in a position to make an announcement,but I agree that it is very important.    It hasnot been overlooked, but is being very closelyexamined by the Government and on behalf ofthe Government by those best qualified to doit. 11S. This examination was in fact being undertaken atthe request of the Treasury by the Inter-departmentalCommittee on Economic Policy, with reference to the possi-bility of providing a range of standard articles of clothingat controlled prices, which might in certain circumstancesinvolve an element of subsidy.

He    REPORT OP THE INTER-DEPARTMENTAL-COMMITTEE,3. After careful consideration,, in which they hadthe benefit of the advice of Lord Woolton, who is atpresent serving in the Ministry of Supply as Director-General of Equipment and Stores, the Inter-departmentalCommittee submitted a report on this subject to the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy.    The conclusionsof this report are as follows&quot;If a scheme for the production and sale of standardclothing under Government supervision should bedecided upon, we suggest that it should be framedon the following lines(i)    The Board of Trade should be responsible forthe working of the scheme for standard cloth-ing and might appoint a suitable person forthis purpose from outside the ranks of theCivil Service.(ii)   The scheme should be operated through.the pur-chase on behalf of the Board of Trade by theexisting organisation for purchasing Armytextiles of a standard cloth, on the best possible terms obtainable, which would be made up by clothing manufacturers on a commissionbasis and re-sold by them, under a re-saleprice agreement, to retailers.(iii)    The scheme should in the first instance be-,.confined to two grades of men&apos;s suits whichwould have sold before the war at retail pricesof 4-Os-r. and (say )-5-Qs^- respectively.(iv)    The retail selling price of the suit should inthe first instance be based on its cost ofproduction at the time of the introduction ofthe scheme;    it should be the objective of theGovernment to maintain this cost for as longas possible, without, however, guaranteeing todo so indefinitely,  in accordance with theprinciples already announced in the case of foodstuffs.(v)    In order to maintain the initial price, itmight be necessary, if costs rose, for theBoard of Trade to incur losses on the sale ofthe standard cloth to the makers-up.(vi)    In the first instance, no restriction should beplaced on the right of the public to buy anynumber of standard suits they might demand;   butif it became plain that a considerable transferof demand from non-standard to standard suitswas taking -place, it might ultimately be neces-sary to contemplate rationing.(vil)    If the experience gained in the operation ofthe scheme was encouraging, it might be extend-ed to boots and shoes, and possibly tomaterials . pr women&apos;s outer clothing&quot;.&apos;

Committtee^niake. no recommendation Oh the question Whether ascheme for standard clothing should at once he put intooperation, hut confine themselves to the question how sucha scheme should he administered, should it be decided on by the War Cabinet*clothing was first advanced on Cost of Living grounds.    Itwas pointed out that clothing was given a weight of twelveper cent,  in the Cost of Living Index, and that an unregu-lated rise of prices in this field might go far to stultifythe effects of price control in the field of foodstuffs.60 The Inter-departmental Committee suggested thatin the first instance any scheme for standard clothingshould be confined to the provision of men&apos;s standard suits,and should be extended later, if experience in this regardwere satisfactory, to boots and shoes and to materials forwomen&apos;s outer clothing.    They concluded, however, that itwould be impossible to provide, at the outset, a range of standard clothing to be sold at controlled prices whichwould cover a large enough proportion of the items includedin the clothing group of the Cost of Living Index to affectmaterially the rise in this component in the index.    In any event, since the decision to regulate the rise in the pricesof foodstuffs was taken, demands for wage advances havebeen based on other grounds than the rise in the Cost ofLiving;    they have not ceased to be made.    Moreover, incertain classes of clothing, notably underwear, economy bythe civilian population is essential, and this economy is unlikely to be secured if prices are not allowed to rise.7* When the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policydiscussed the matter, it was generally agreed that if thedecision to go forward with a scheme of standard clothingwas to be based on the scheme&apos;s influence on the Cost ofLiving Index, and through that on the course of wageIII.THE NEED FOR SCHEME.5.The proposal to provide a range of standard

negotiations, it could not &quot;be justified.    At the sametime, however, considerations of a somewhat different character were advanced which to me and to the Committeegenerally, strongly supported the view that some scheme ofthis kind is necessary.8. It has recently become necessary to curtail thesupplies of raw wool to the domestic market for civilianuse, to not much more than half the quantity absorbed inthe year 1938.    This step has been made necessary by thegreat demands of the Services on the one hand, and by theneed to divert as much wool as can be spared into pro-duction for the export market.    The effects of this stepwill not be felt for some months;   but after the exhaust-ion of existing stocks, by next October at the latest,when supplies of winter clothing are normally being bought,there will probably be an acute shortage of clothingsupplies, and a very substantial rise in their prices,unless in the meanwhile countervailing action has beentaken.    Moreover, this shortage is likely to be most severein the cheaper grades of clothing, which require almost as much wool in their manufacture as the more expensiveones.    The poorest classes who buy cheap suits would not beable to compete successfully with the richer sections ofthe community for the limited supplies of wool.   Yet theirneed for clothing is in fact the more urgent as their reserves of clothing are smaller.    In these circumstancesa demand would inevitably arise for some action on thepart of the Government.    I cannot exclude the possibility that it may eventually become necessary to ration suppliesof clothing;    but as a first step a scheme for standardclothing on some such lines as those proposed by theInter-departmental Committee appears to me necessary.

IVo    MODIFICATIONS IN TEE SCHEMERECOMMENDED,9o In the course of the discussion at the ministerial Committee certain modifications of the schemesummarised in paragraph 3 above were suggested.    It willbe observed that the Committee suggested   that the inter-vention of the Government should take the form of theprovision of a standard cloth to be sold to makers-up onthe conditions that they should:--(a) manufacture the cloth into standard suits(and provide the trimmings) for a fixedcharge ;(b) sell the suits so made to retailers undera resale price agreement defining the retail price.-,It ?rauld be open, to all rnakers-up, including the largefirms which specialise in the production of cheap suits,to undertake this work.    It has been suggested, however,that it might be sufficient for the Government to confineitself to the -provision of a standard cloth, leaving itto the trade to make up this cloth in the most suitable form.    I doubt myself whether this proposal would securethe principal objective of the scheme, namely, the pro-vision of the cheaper classes of clothing in adequatequantities at reasonable prices.    Yet this is a proposal which should not be excluded in any decision of principle which the Government may now make on the question;    thisquestion should be reserved until some progress has beenmade in the consultations with the trade which will benecessary as soon as the Government has taken its decision in principle.+See conclusion (ii) quoted in paragraph 3 above a

10o The question whether standard boots and shoesshould be provided simultaneously with standard suits for menalso requires eon side ration.      Such a scheme was successfullyundertaken in the la&amp;t war, and may present fewer technical difficulties-,,     Moreover,, it has the advantage that it bringssome relief to the cost of the outfits for women and childrenas well as for men, and one moreover in respect of animportant element in working-class expenditure0    The technical problems involve3. will require to be fully examined,,11. Finally, it was suggested at the ministerial committee that responsibility for the working of the scheme could more appropriately be vested in the Ministry of Supplythan in the Board of Trade,,     Both the Ministers concernedconcur in this suggest! on r.Vo      P.EC0MI iENDATION-o120 The general cone lias ion which I have reached is that,if any scheme- -far-standard clothing is to be introduced, it. &amp;is necessary for the Government.at once -to. take a decision inprinciple, since whatever   scheme is decided upon, it ;Ls&quot;essential that preliminary steps should now be taken if any form of standard, clothing is to be actually available by nextOctober?    I accordingly recommend;-that the War Cabinet should nows-(a) decide in principle to arrange for theprovision, not later than the beginning ofOctober next, of:-. (i)    a   standard cloth for standard suits&quot;j(ii)    standard boots and shoes for men,women and children!

(b) decide that the working of the scheme should be vested in the Ministry ofSupply;(c) to authorise me to arrange for thenecessary preparatory steps to be takendepartmentally to give effect to theforegoing decision in principle;(d) agree that I should make a suitablepublic announcement when the preliminarysteps referred to above have reachedsuch a stage as to render this desirable.(Initialled) J.
