H.W.154. CONFIDENTIAL.COMMITTEE ON THE GRANT OF HONOURS. DECORATIONS AND MEDALSIN TIME OF WAR.&apos;    1959 - 194-0.THE ROYAL MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE.MEMORANDUM ON PROPOSED EXTENSION OF ISSUE.Cabinet conclusion.The Cabinet recently agreed that consideration should begiven to the question whether His Majesty should now be advised toextend the Royal Message of Condolence to cover the relatives of allpersons killed by enemy action.Action taken in September,  1959.Members of the Committee will recollect that when inSeptember 1939 the proposal to recommend the issue of a letter ofcondolence was considered by an inter-departmental conference, theconclusion reached was   that the Civil Defence organisation would be&quot;liable to the same risks of death as the personnel of the three fighting Services.      The Police, the Civil Service, civilian employees of the Government, munition workers and many other categories may all be regarded as in the front line and the ordinary man and woman in the street may lose their lives by enemy action.&quot;     The conferenceconsidered &quot;that it would be impracticable to differentiate betweenthe Fighting and the Civilian Services,  the representatives of theMinistry of Health and Ministry of Home Security pointing out thatthey had no central machinery for notifying individual casualties.Such casualties would be notified locally from the hospital concerned.&quot;The representatives of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry ofHome Security also pointed out that Service and civilian casualtiesmight occur simultaneously and that one hospital might containindividuals of all categories whose injuries might prove fatal.    Anydiscrimination in the matter of messages might prove a source of embarrassment which the representatives of the fighting Servicesrecognised while naturally rather favouring the despatch of someRoyal message to their Services.&quot;The conference reported that it was  in their view &quot;forconsideration v/hether any satisfactory method of the despatch of royal messages to individuals&quot; could be devised.The First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr.  Churchill) did not agreewith the conclusions of the conference and said that in his view the message should be sent to all killed on duty, whether members of thefighting Services, or civilians.The Admiralty stated that no doubt the problem of who should&quot;be regarded as a civilian on duty is not entirely free fromdifficulty, but it seems likely that it ought to cover not only CivilServants, in the ordinary sense of the term, but all those who  are forthe time being employed &quot;in the Civil Defence organisation11, such asambulance drivers, fire fighters, A.R.P. wardens and the like.&quot;   TheFirst Lord considered it &quot;important that the Royal condolence should go only to those who are on duty at the time they are killed.&quot;
The Admiralty pointed out that there was a &quot;class of individuals intermediate &quot;between those hilled while directly in theemploy of the State and the ordinary civilians namely, those who arekilled while employed at the works of Contractors*&quot;    The First Lorddid not make known his final views as regards this category, hut was believed to be inclined to the view that it would not be possible toinclude them.   The Admiralty pointed out that it would &quot;of course, be slightly invidious that Royal condolence should go to a workman who iskilled in a   Royal Dockyard and not to a workman killed while in theemploy of Vickerso&quot;    But the practical difficulties of extending thecondolences to those employed by   Contractors were, so far as could beseen in the Admiralty, insuperable, since there would be immensedifficulty in dealing with such cases as Sub-Contractors or Contractorwho are partly employed, on Government work and partly on commercialwork*The conference met again and reported that the only practicable alternative seemed to be to confine the message to thethree military Services, though there were great objections to this.Action taken in February - April,. 1940aVarious questions relative to the issue of the message were referred in february,  1940, to the Committee on the grant of Honours,Decorations and Medals in time of war,   As a result, it was decidedto recommend that a message should be sent in respect of death in themilitary Services when death is attributable to such military service.The Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets are included, the issue beinglimited to cases of death qualifying dependants for benefits underthe War Pensions and Detention Allowance (Mercantile Marine, etc)8chemes 1939, or which would qualify dependants were there any such,Cat eft-pries of -persons now to be considered.. -  &apos;The various categories of persons who may now be consideredincludeRegular PoliceRegular FiremenThe Civil Defence organisation the Civil Service9 including all persons employed directly by theGovernments e.g.. Dockyard workmen and PostmenEmployees at the works of Government contractorsEmployees at the works of sub-contractors to Government contractorsEmployees at the works of contractors partly employed on government work and partly on commercial workTransport workersLocal authority officers not belonging to the Civil Defence organisatiMembers of the general public killed while helping others, a self-imposed dutyOther members of the general public, victims of air raids
I have now consulted the members of the Committee most closely concerned,      In our view, the issue of the Royal message of Condolence to the next of kin of all civilians killed asa result of enemy action may reduce the value of the message whichis already sent to the relatives of those killed in the Navy,Army, Air Force and Merchant Navy,     We would have preferred tohave dealt with some more limited extension.We have carefully considered, however, whether it wouldbe feasible to arrange for the issue of a message to the relativesof all civilians killed by enemy action.      The cases fall roughlyunder three heads;  (l) those who die in casualty hospitals;(2) those who are buried by the local authority;  (3) those who dieat home and are buried, by their relatives.    The majority fall in categories (l)  and (2) and it is the names of these that appear inthe lists put up outside town halls.     Next of kin of persons in categories (l) and (2) receive a letter containing the following sentence:-&quot;The Minister of Health asks us to express the deepsympathy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with you in your loss&quot;.Lists obtained by the Ministry of Health from the localauthority will consist mainly of categories (l) and (2), but willnot be complete.      The only complete lists will be those obtainedfrom the Registrar-General,      The person registering the deathmust give his address;&apos;   frequently he is the next of kin, to whomthe message could appropriately be sent.     Where the localauthority bury the body, they register the death, but the Ministryof Health could make arrangements asking them, in notifying the registrar,  to add whenever possible the name and address of thenext   of kin.We have come to the conclxision that a fairly satisfactory scheme could be devised.      There will be some instances in whichthe next of kin are unknown, but in the majority of cases itwould be possible to send the message,      The document would best be sent out by making use of the services of the Registrar-General,-3-
The message sent to the relatives of those killed in themilitary services rnils as f o 11 ows i -&quot;The Queen and I offer you our heartfelt sympathy in yourgreat sorrow.We pray that your country&apos;s gratitude for a life so noblygiven in its service -nay &quot;Bring you some measure of consolation.&quot;&apos;This is issued on Buckingham Palace notepaper,,If it is decided to recommend to the King that the message should he extended not, for instance, to the Civil Defence organisationonly, hut to the next of kin of all civilians killed as a result of enemy action, we consider that the form of the message itself and themethod of transmission should he altered.In our view, a formal message coming direct from the King andQueen would he inappropriate.      It may he suggested that a message sent by a Minister will not he sufficiently appreciated.      An alternativeappears to he an impersonal statement in the style of the scroll issued after the last war,&quot;He whom this scroll conkriGihorates was numbered among those who........ finally passed out of the sight of men by the path of duty and self sacrifice, giving up their own lives,  etc.,:These documents were intended for preservation as permanentmementos to supplement messages of condolence.      We have not yetrecommended the introduction of ouch scrolls during this war.      It is amatter to ho dealt with later on.We therefore recommend that should It he desired to send an expression of condolence from Their Majesties to the next of kin of allcivilians killed by enemy action, consideration should he given to thepossibility of sending a message on Home Office notepaper as follows:-&quot;The Home Secretary has it in command from the King to convey to you an expression of Their Majesties&apos;  sympathy in your greatloss.wIn appropriate circumstances the Secretary of State forScotland would send the message. . ?(S i gn c d)      H.
