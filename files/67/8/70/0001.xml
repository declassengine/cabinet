1 Q *\i. i.; tj^financial ARRANGJ:ii.EFTo ./TTH THERAIL&apos; /AYS .Joint memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Transport.-At their meeting on September 3rd the War Cabinetinstructed the Minister.of Transport to aim at:-(i) A limitation of net pool profits to the pre-war averageof  40 millions.(ii) Avoidance of general increase in railway charges,particularly in railway-fares.The Minister of Transport was also invited to take into consideration,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Questionwhether there was a case for reducing the preferential margin onthe Government traffic,  subject to no interference with thefacilities for travel at reduced rates at present accorded to members of the Armed Forces.(2) On September 13th the Charges (Railway Control);Consultative Committee,  to whom the application&apos; of the RailwayCompanies for an. all-over increase of        had been referred.,-reported that the additional revenue necessary to cover estimatedincreased costs to 30th September, 1941, could be secured by making-no increase in  ieason Tickets (First or Third Class) or Workmen&apos;sTickets,  or- the ordinary fares on the London Passenger TransportBoard1s system, while increasing other charges and fares from theirpresent level of lOf, above the pre-war basis.to 16%%%, - i. e., toabout 6% above their present level.(3) &apos;This report goes far to meet the public criticism whichhad been evoked by the remit to the&apos;Committee and which was freelyvoiced during the Public Inquiry.     That criticism was very largelydirected against any further increase in cost of that essentialtravel which is an important part of the cost of living of workmen,clerks and others whose earnings provide little or no margin above what is required for a reasonable standard of living.(4) There remains the recommended general increase in charges and other fares of 62/3/i.      This has been criticised mainly on theground that it constitutes an undesirable impulse to the &quot;viciousspiral&quot;, but against this it is in our view of the first importance that the railways should be maintained in a healthy economic state.The proposed increase in charges will do no more than offsetincreases in wages and other working costs which the railways havehad to incur through no fault of their own and the only alternative to an increase in charges is some form of subsidy -which we shouldstrongly deprecate.     Whatever may happen to the railway systemafter the war, ,i.e.,. whether it is brought under some forrrrofGovernment ownership or returned to private ownership, difficult and costly problems will arise,  as they did at the end of the last war,  if the railways are not run on an economic basis during control the Government would he faced with one of two alternatives - a large and continuing subsidy or a heavy increase in charges on the cessation of control when such a change would be peculiarlydifficult on all grounds.      There is the further point - and thisarose during the last war - that if railway charges are artificiallydepressed, the effect upon other competing forms of transport mayhe very serious.3SCEET.

. (5) As the 62/3$ increases are designed not only to covercurrent increased costs but also to compensate for increased costs which the railways have suffered in the recent past, there is rbcgjkfor a further increase in current costs before grounds for any- . ^further increase of charges would arise.(6) We have examined the point which the War Cabinet discussedabout the Government preferential rates.   We are advised that theannual saving to the Government from railway charges below theordinary level (as agreed under the Cheap Trains Act 1883) may amountto  3 millions a year on the present basis of Government, user ofthe railways,,   We are not, however, convinced, on the informationbefore vs at present, that the lower rates now paid by the Staterepresent anything but reasonable commercial rates for bulk user,(7) We have examined the suggestion that the railways shouldbe tied down to a fixed payment based on pre-war earnings, with theobject, if possible, of limiting the net pool profits to  40 millions.We think that the principle of the existing agreement which recognises that the railways are entitled to a reasonable and modest reward for efficient and economic working is sound.    This incentive wouldobviouslybe&apos; lacking in any arrangement for a fixed guarantee.(8) The detailed agreement based on the White Paper (Cmd.6168)&apos; is practically complete, but a new factor has entered into thesituation which will make it necessary to revise the agreement inone important respect.    This factor is the new War compensation scheme which must clearly apply to the railways in common with allother public utilities.    The White Paper provides that the cost of restoring war damage up to a maximum of  10. millions a year shall bemet as a revenue charge, when the damage occurs,  the intention being that the cost should be recovered from railway users through&quot;increased charges.    This arrangement was made on.the assumption that industry generally would pass on the cost of war damage to theconsumer.     The new compensation scheme, on the other hand, treatswar damage essentially as a capital charge.   How the new scheme is tobe applied to the railways will require further consideration, butit is at least clear that it will involve an Important modificationof the present arrangements.(9) Our recommendations on this matter are therefore as follows:-(a) Effect should at once be given to the recommendations in thereport of the Charges (Railway Control) consultative committee,    The longer this is delayed the greater becomesthe &quot;lag&quot; caused by the increased costs being not offset by increased charges.(b) The principles of the Railway Agreement- should be preserved,but negotiations should at:once be opened with the RailwayCompanies with a view to such modifications of that agreement as are necessary to meet the new situationcreasted by the Government&apos;s War Compensation Scheme.(Init.)
