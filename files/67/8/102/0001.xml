HOME FOOD PRODUCTIONMGjnprmicTum Jojr the.....Minis tor of Agri culture and^-JiMMfi:.....Sec refary of &quot;S^te&quot;^or^cJo*tl^^ &quot;arid&apos;-%Ko.ISecypTary &quot;^&quot;State: for the Home&quot; Department.The question whether home food production in 1941 shouldhe increased beyond, the programme of expansion decided upon and provided for in August last is a matter of high policy to bedetermined by the V/ar Cabinet.      It may, however&quot;, be useful ifwe place before our colleagues our views on the problems .....involved and the measures which would be required to achieve a further increase in production from our soil if the V/war cabinet  decide that such an increase is necessary.2. The main question is what increased production are weto aim at a      Land produces more human food, if used for theproduction of crops for direct human consumption then if usedfor growing grass or fodder crops to be eaten by livestock toproduce milk, meat or eggs.,      If we are to contemplate acondition of dire necessity in which the maximum possible amountof human food is to be produced from our soil then we mustincrease our arable acreage to the maximum and consume the resulting crops direct.      Such a policy is undoubtedly possible.But it means the slaughter on a wholesale scale of our livestock;it is irrevocable;  It would presumably involve a drastic changein the normal diet of the people, it wouldLhave very serious results in diminished fertility and consequently in diminishedyields in subsequent years;    and it would obviously have a generally disruptive effect on agriculture as we know it to-day.The ideal as we see it is to increase production on presentlines over as wide a field as possible;    while adhering to existing priorities (e,,g, milk, etc, ).     We should thus preserveflexibility and always be in a position to adopt the drasticalternative mentioned above if we were driven to it.3. In any event our aim must be still further to improve the productivity of the land.      This can be done by raising the yield from existing arable and grassland or by ploughing up grassland for the production of arable crops, or by a combination of botliss4. If grassland, is ploughed up for the production of arablecrops it follows that livestock will be displaced.      Therefore,all grazings not suitable for ploughing should be fullyutilised as a partial offset to this loss of grass.      It isimportant to maintain hill sheep farms.      There are alsoconsiderable areas of deer forest and similar land that couldbe grazed by cattle and sheep and we should recommend that steps be taken to secure the better use of such lands in thenational interest Including measures to reverse the process ofdeterioration in recent years paused by pests of which thechief are rabbits arid bracken.c  In this connection it should be noted that by raising theyields of the existing arable acreage by 5;.j, which is by nomeans impossible, we should secure an addition to our&apos;food-supplies equivalent to the additional amount produced byploughing up one rail ion acres of grassland and. sowing it tocrops.

5. In considering the practical measures required toincrease the productivity of the land and its more intensivecultivation we have to deal with two main classes of farmers:-(l) About three-auarters of the ordinary agricultural land of the country is-famed by men who are competent toincrease the production of their far: is on the linesthat may be required in the national interest asordered by the County hxecativo -Committees,,The problem in these cases is that the capitalexpenditure recuired to secure maximum production ascompared with present production (e. ge expenditureon converting grass into arable, drainage, -machinery,etc. ) can only be? recovered over one, or even two,farm rotations of four years.      I &quot;any of these farmers are now, as a result of the improved prices,beginning to get out of debt incurred during the pre-war years and the;- are reluctant to incur further commitments which they could not repay unless theyare assured of stable prices and markets beyond 1941.In view of the experte .ees connected with the corn production Act in the last war wc regard it as outof the question to  ;;ive a guarantee  for an indefinite period or even for a period of five or seven years as has been suggested in certain quarters,    &quot;&quot;e think,however, that it would be practicable arc1 reasonable to give a guarantee that the present orioes will bemaintained,  subject to adjustment in the event of asubstantial increase in the costs of production, forthe duration of the war and for at least one yearthereafter.    (he think this guarantee of price shouldalso    cover a guarantee of markets. )   Tie also suggestthat a statement should be made that the Government,representing as it does all political parties,recognises the importance of maintaining after thewar a healthy and. well-balanced agriculta.no as anessential feature of national policy.(2) Secondly, there are the farmers, occupying acomparatively small but none the less significantarea of land, who have neither the cash nor the credit nor the specialised knowledge to carry   nitthe work necessary to make their farms fullyproductive.    In some cases County Executive committees are insisting on a change of tenant or takingpossession of the farm and letting it to an efficienttenant.    This procedure, however, entails formalitiesin regard;&apos; to valuation, compensation, etc.  and canonly be followed in a comparative!;&apos;&quot; small number    ofcases owing to the lack of suitable alternativetenants./  The only way to deal with the majorityof farms; of this hind if the land is to be made fullyproductive is for County Committees tr:   arrange to dothe necessary work (cleaning ditches, plou ;kiag,applying&apos;, fertilisersP  destroying rabbits and otherpests; etc.) without necessarily being c- retain thatthey will be able to recover the full cost.    Wesuggest that schemes should be prepared fordealing v/ith this type of farm en these lines.By the above means a considerable intensification  -of effort and production would in our opinion besecured.

60    The following measures would also be required:-(a) Drainage,,    It would be neoos/; ary to accelerate the present programme of cleaning out streams,water courses, farm ditches and of fielddrainage so as to improve the productivity ofagricultural land generally and enablewaterlogged grassland to be brought under theplough,.    At present grants of 50fb are availablefor work of this hind but an effective stimuluswould be given if the balance of cost could be advanced to Drainage Authorities pending itsrecover.&apos; Zvam the land owners,.    Additionalworkers to the number of about 10,000 wouldbe required to bo employed by DrainageAuthorities on streams, water courses, etc.and in gangs by County Lbcccutivc committees on farm ditches..    In Scotland, wheredifferent conditions prevail methods suitable to those conditions would have to be takento accelerate:, dro.in.age schemes,(b) Fertilisers,  larger supplies of fertilisersparticularly ph-isphatic and nitrogenousfertilisers.  would be rcquiredo(c) Machinery and materials^ More tractors,including trac?:-laying tractors from the UnitedStates. and more agricultural machinery of allkinds would bo needed together with essentialmaterials such as fencing wire-7.    It is already late for farmers to make further plans for next year&apos;s harvest and. if any further substantial increase of production is to be secured a very early decision is required0(dxlldo ) 1S.LSc3.8th November, 1940,
