&quot; MINISTER&apos; S BROADCAST W&amp;EBfc&amp;we are seeing more and more clearly that the Battle of britain is only a part of the world war.    And within the battle of Britain conflict between the German Air Force andthe civilian population is itself only a part.    But what avitally important part it is!     How the whole fortune of warturns upon it!    We all feel a glow of pride in the work ofour Civil Defence army.     A year ago could we have foreseenthe performance they have put up?    There they are - bankclerks, shopkeepers, stockbrokers, civil servants, craftsmen,labourers - peaceable, steady folk.     The world is electrifiedto see them stand up as they have done to the rain of fire and.death that has poured upon them night after night - stand upto it, and do their job, and never fail their neighbours or their duty.    And our police. - they have lived up to andsurpassed their finest traditions.     Tou, the ordinary citizens of the country - a solid promise of victory lies in the factthat for months you have stood up to the attack, kept yournerve, and are ready for more if more is to oome.     You havewon the first round - won it hands down.     Not London alone,but the great provincial cities and towns - yes and ourvillages too in many parts of the country. , Well done,magnificently done, men, women and children of Britain!\ I come to tell you of, the plans made and the actions takenby me, for you, in my new office of Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security.     I do not come to tell you how you are to beshut away from the rigour and stress of war as though you wereunfit to play your part.     If, in the midst of the battle weconcentrated all our efforts on passive defence,&apos; then ouractive defence would suffer and we would be worse off than ever.     Besides, we are arming for the&apos; offensive, and for /thatsteel, cement and bricks are needed, for munition and aircraft factories and aerodromes.    Remember too, that the R.A.F. isactive over Germany and its occupied territories.     The Nazishave troubles in respect of air attacks not less than our own.The man or woman who clamours for everything in the wayof material and labour to be. devoted to passive defence makes a great mistake.     The successful conduct of war needs wide-spread- determined action above ground, not only by the armed forces, not only by the civil defence workers of all ranks -it is well for us all that they have not insisted on safety -but ;by the workers in the war factories and indeed byeverybody.     Victory will go to those who fight hardest and work hardest.    .   . - &apos;But there is no logic and no humanity in toleratingunnecessary danger or discomfort.     I want to bring it about that everyone shall be as safe, and sleep as comfortably, andbe as healthy as the onset of war allows.     I know what sort of life this Blitzkrieg has brought.to the people in our bigcities.     I have seen much and heard more, and I understand the background of it all.    What I can do to make life easier,that will I do.In particular I want to say a word at the outset about thechildren.     Hundreds of thousands still remain in theBlitzkrieg.    The front line is not the place for children.None of us can be happy to think of them, needlessly subjected to danger and strain with no fair chance for health and education.     It is the duty of parents to let us get their children out, as we can do, effectively and kindly, to wherethey can live more normal lives.    Moreover those who remainare hindrances to our war effort, and their removal will help the work of Civil Defence.
I como now to deal with the provision of shelter.     remember that just as absence from tho scene of danger is the bestprotection of all, so the next best thing is to scatter as widelyas possible within the area of danger.     No shelter offers an absolute guarantee .of complete safety, in practice there is nohundred percent safety.     Several types however, give a high degree of protection. .  A great many people - I am glad of it -want privacy or fresh air and comfort;   and they are more interested in these things than in the possibility of slightlygreater safety in a field in which - I say it again - there isno absolute safety.     Other people take other views.     So we want more Anderson shelters, and more communal surface shelters,r-.ore basements, more deep shelter, where practicable,, and more ofany other good protection that we. call secure.now for the steps we are taking.We are making a survey of private basement shelter, andhave taken powers to require the opening of such as can be opened;..-;: These powers will be exorcised by the LocalAuthorities:   but in case those who want to&apos;keep the sheltersclosed without good reason have too much influence with theLocal Authority, I have taken special, powers&apos;for&quot; the Regional&quot;Commissioners- to step in and act.     Much of this basement spacewill be-bunked and tickets will later.bo issued.,for., it..We, shall proyidc%for the extension.-of.-, surf ace communal-shelters,;.-which are popular and welX.used pjimanyYareas,,     New-designs- ape-being&apos; worked; out-&apos;and.&apos;plans-are on -foot, for certainimprovements to existing :shelters;.;;&apos;,&quot; .... . -.1       :-&quot;-:-&quot;u*    More steel has .been allotted&apos;for building&apos;--the largerAnderson shelter,- and also for extending-in appropriate cases-existing-smaller shelters: to 6 feet so that-they: too can take. bunks..&quot;.., -I have&apos; secured more cement for concreting and w^ter-plr&apos;oofing.,Anders&apos;bn&apos;- shelters, and&quot; here I am graceful&apos; for the. - co&quot;Operation.t)f other-.Ministers who need cement.    Remember,! however,., that -in this matter of waterproofing therelis much that you can do for yourselves.     Your warden or your LocalAuthority will1 tell you how to do it.   ,       - - -&apos;.   Then we shall provide-for&apos;vthe.. increased&apos; use &quot;of - certain&apos; types of strong&apos; modern .building, using some&apos; &quot;floors above groundas well as the basements *v.   Certain lower floors when-properlyprotected against blasts- \offer excellent shelter,...  -This-type- of -building exists widely in some of our big cities, and the fuller. ;use of it &quot;to which I have been led through the-:-combinedopinion of scientists and practical engineers will mean anotherbig and welcome addition to our resources^&apos; &quot;- I&apos;&apos;.&apos;In ii-onddfif- T&apos;; have&apos; begn .fable to put,. tP wsb additional tubeaccommodation&apos;and I expect.still further^additions.     I willlay hands:;upon any other type of deep shelter that is available.And ,now I want to. say a few general words about deepshelter.     Two years ago I pleaded for as much of it as possible and. I don! t regret having done so.     We could do with that shelternow.,     But we are at war, and the whole, circumstances are different.     Iv have examined tho question closely and carefully,with a perfectly&apos; open mind, - as I promised.     I have consulted the best expert/opinion, including some fresh minds,&apos;and I. have come to these conclusions - &quot;
(l) In some places, and in some circumstances, theconstruction of deep shelter is practicable, and willbe undertaken.     The deep shelter provided in london by tho tubes will be extended by tunnelling.     Incertain other parts of the country where the slope ofthe ground and the nature of the soil make tunnellinga relatively easy matter, work will also be begun.But the amount of deep shelter thus provided will inevitably be quite a small part of the total shelterin the country.(2) No appreciable amount of this deep shelter, even intho most favourable event, can be ready until this winter is over.     This fact I cannot alter.(3) Anything like a universal policy of deep shelter, forthe whole population or the greater part of it, isbeyond the bounds of practical possibility.     this fact too I cannot alter.     To attempt to build morethan a limited amount in suitable places would meanproviding deep shelter for a given number at the costof leaving a much larger number with no good shelterat all.These are the plain facts.     I tell you the truth as i see it, knowing you to he, not a set of faint hearts longingfor fairy tales about absolute safety, but a great peoplestanding erect and fighting for its life.     Be on your guard against all who seek to make this deep shelter cry a.means ofdefeatist agitation.Political schemers sailing under all sorts of officialsounding names such as A.P.P. Co-ordinating Committees who seek-to destroy our will to take risks in freedom&apos;s cause are,whether they realise it or not, playing Hitler&apos;s game, as their friends played the Nazi and Fascist game of democraticdisintegration in Germany and France.     Their guiding principle,has been &quot;Through chaos to triumph&quot;.     They have helped to cause plenty of chaos in what were once democratic countries;but the resulting triumph has been the triumph of Fascism andreaction.     These people are not numerous, but beware of them:they are mischievous.     Hitler is no doubt delighted with theirmanoeuvres.     He knows that if our people could be stampededinto putting a narrow personal safety before success, he wouldwin;   that if fear could be so stimulated as to weaken our willactively to struggle for the liberties of Britain and of all. mankind, then the tragic story of France would also be the story of Britain.     That musn&apos;t happen.     And it won&apos;t.I pass to other matters.Shelter life brings serious problems of&apos; health and comfort,and my colleagues and I have been acting to find speedysolutions for them.The Ministry of Health is organising a medical service inall large shelters, where a doctor will deal with minor ailments,and nip infection in the bud.     The First Aid Posts inshelters, too, will extend their scope to deal with all sortsof minor ailments 0Nearly a million and three quarter bunks have been ordered;installation has begun and before long much the greater partof the job will be done.     lie are instituting a ticket system which I hope wo shall be able to extend widely.     It will help
to do away&apos; With queues and introduce an extra measure of orderinto, all life in public shelters.     Remember-, however, that publicshelters are &quot;not everything - far from it.     Even in Londonpublic shelters aro used by less than one in six of thepopulation.     Some 85. percent sleep in thoir houses or flats with local protection, in their Anders da shelters&apos;? or in communaldomestic&apos; she It ers^-.   These calm determined people. deserve thehighest praise,     Somo people are apt to forgot them - the whole85 percent of them.     But I do not forget them.     They, andthose. who -use public shelters will, I hope benefit from a campaign which I shall.shortly sot or. foot to instruct people how to make the very best of shelter life:   it will, I- believe be apractical and helpful campaign:   and it will include an effort toenlighten tho very sorely tried people whose homes are destroyed or&apos;&quot;.damaged, by making known the various main facts that a raidvictim needs to have in his or her&apos; mind...Reverting for a moment to the Civil Defence workers, I know that in some respects their conditions of&apos; work are capable of improvements .   They have carried 021 cheerfully like soldiers inthe line/    Before long I hope that there will be some good newsfor them.&apos; That, then is my interim report - a plain tale of how mattersstand at&quot; the end of throe weeks in office.Thank you.- all of you.     You wait through night afternight of noise and strain, and then come back in the morning,not downhearted, do your day&apos;s work in tho house, the factory,the school or the office, end it, and face another night.     Monthsof it and still going strong, ready if need be for morel     Men&quot;and women of the cities and the bombed areas, you are fighting agreat fight in a great causeI     You aro an inspiration to freemen, and to. men who would bo free, in all the world. &apos;   I saluteyou.     I am proud to serve.&quot;you.        &apos;
