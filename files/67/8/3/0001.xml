q 91^SECRET9nd AUGUST 1940W A R   CABINET.DANISH PRIZES UNDER FRENCH FLAG IN UNITED KINGDOM PORTS.Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping.The Cabinet gave approval to my proposals in memorandum .P.  (G)  (40) 180 /&quot;Cabinet Minutes dated 13th July (W.M. (40)202ndConclusions/ that French ships in United Kingdom ports should berequisitioned under the Defence Regulations.     This operation hasbeen carried out in respect of privately owned French merchant ships,but it appears that the ships under French flag in United kingdom ports included five which, prior to the invasion of Denmark, were onthe Danish Register by virtue of their Danish ownership and were either seized in prize by the French or seized in this country byus and handed over to the French to be put through the French prize court.So far as can be ascertained from the ships&apos; papers, there isno evidence that any of these ships have been formally condemned inthe French Prize Court.These ships have not been requisitioned under the defence regulations as this procedure would have put His Majesty&apos;sGovernment under a legal obligation to pay compensation under theCompensation (Defence) Act, 1939, whereas this could be avoided by adopting Prize Court procedure.Prize Court procedure appears to be applicable in the case ofthese ships and it is accordingly submitted that they should atonce be seized in prize in this country and then requisitioned outof the Prize Court for service.     This is the procedure which wasadopted in respect of other Danish ships seized by us in thiscountry.     Besides removing the legal obligation to pay compensation under the Compensation (Defence) Act, Prize Court procedure would,if the Prize Court proceeded to condemnation, probably give a bettertitle than requisitioning under the Defence Regulations.R.H.G.Ministry of Shipping.2nd August, 1940.COPY NO. 5Q
