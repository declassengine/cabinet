H;.^.272-80 K.JSECRET. &apos; C *COPY NO.     \   IW.P.(&amp;)( 40)295.11 th November,, 1940*WAR   CABINET.Supply of Machine Tools.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour and National- Service.1.     The Minister of Aircraft Production suggests in his Paper W.P.(&amp;)(40)286that the provision of machine tools for Training Centres not already inoperation should be abandoned.2.     This would involve a reversal, of the Cabinet decision reached on21st October after much discussion.3.     I have already opened ten new Centres and I am opening nine more beforethe end of the year.4*     Up to the present I have secured only 827 machines while another 2,,415are required.     Many of the 827 are still only paper allocations.5.     A large part of the demand is for machine tool workers.     These cannotbe trained if there are no machines on which to train them.     The Centresare already training as many fitters as can be absorbed at present by theindustry.6.     The type of machine tool training given in my Centres which turns themen out as setter-operators cannot be given in employers&apos; workshops unless they devote special bays and machines to the purpose.     This involvesallocating machines to training just as much as if the machines were inGovernment Training Centres.7.     Aircraft factories receive a large proportion of the trainees from theGovernment Training Centres.8.     The acceptance of the proposal in Lord Beaverbrook!s memorandum is absolutely against the desires of aircraft manufacturers who are continuallypressing me to increase the supply of trainees from the Centres.     if adopted, the proposal would make it just impossible to - supply the trainedlabour necessary to carry out the programme which the Cabinet has alreadylaid down.(initd.)
