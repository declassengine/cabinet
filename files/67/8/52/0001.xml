State for India. -I circulate to the War Cabinet:.: &apos;-  &apos;   -      (1) a telegram dated 22nd September 1940, in whichthe Viceroy raised the question whether or not- he should,proceed with the&apos; expansion of his-   &apos; Executive Council in. the event of -the muslim league (in addition, to the Congress) refusing-   .     -&apos;   - to cooperate;(2) my interim reply dated 24th September;(3) a telegram dated 30th September, giving the text of a resolution passed by the Muslim League on&apos;   the 28th September which maires it clear that they&apos; -     ar; not prepared to,cooperate;(4) a telegram dated 1st October in which theViceroy comments on this resolution.;.(.5) my personal telegram to the Viceroy dated 2ndOctober asking whether he has any further views!to express.The Kain alternatives now for decision are&apos;summarised inparagraph 3 of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of 22nd September.They are: ...(I) To proceed with expansion by taking in representativesof the parties who have agreed to cooperate and alsoincluding two Muslims despite the refusal of the muslim League;(II) To proceed with expansion as above but withoutincluding any Muslims;(III) To abandon the idea of expansion.I remain in favour of course (I).    The arguments infavour of course (III) are briefly that since the two mainparties in India have refused to cooperate it would be idle to expand the Council by bringing in Indians who do not represent the real political forces which sway India.    this applies, of course, even more strongly to course (II) whichwould have the additional disadvantage of leaving the Governor-General with an Executive Council entirely unbalanced from the communal point of view.   Against course (I) it may further besaid that to bring in two Muslims who are not recognised byJhe Muslim League would antagonise the League and thereby add to our embarrassments if there is a conflict with the Congress.l   ,  On the other hand in favour of course (I) there is muchbe said for compelling the Muslim League to face the-onsequences of their refusal.   On general grounds I would prefer to make   it clear that we are still anxious to worv,ith those who are ready to wor^ with us, rather than to admitmat the Congress and the Muslim League between them, and on
entirely incompatible grounds, are entitled to veto our proposal for enlisting the cooperation of representativeIndians in the prosecution,of the war effort by theGovernment of India.   Moreover although there should be some reasonable balance of elements and parties In an expandedCouncil there is not the same reason for considering partyalignments in the Legislature or in the country as therewould be in the case of a Ministry responsible to theLegislature.    I.believe it would be a mistake to admitdefeat at the hands of irresponsible and short-sighted partycaucuses and not attempt to rally and give confidence tothose, if they can be found, who are prepared to put Indiafirst.The War Cabinet will have seen from the Viceroystelegram of 30th September, 2009-S, which has already been circulated, that it is now quite clear not only that theCongress will refuse to cooperate but that a conflict ofsome vind with the Government is inevitable.   At the sametime it seems unlively that the Congress will rna^e this theoccasion to pass a resolution in terms such as would justifythe Government of India in taking comprehensive actionforthwith against the leaders.   It is more probable that atthe outset at any rate individual members of the Congresswill lay themselves open to prosecution for incitement to obstruct the war effort and that this process may be accompanied by some spectacular action on Mr. gandhis ownpart.L. S. A.INDIA OFFICE3rd October 1940.
TELEGRAM from Governor-General to Secretary of State forIndia, dated 22nd. September, 1940.-1955-3Personal.   Jinnah is due to see me on the 24th prior to meeting of his Wording Committee at Simla.   You have had my telegram No.1828 dated September 10th giving Si^endar&apos;s account of Jinnah&apos;s attitude at Bombay.   While there is nothing sufficiently definite to justify pessimism, and i hope that Jinnah when I see him will be reasonable, furtherindications tend to support suggestion that Jinnah, thoughpressure from his- colleagues may be too strong for him, isnot himself anxious to come in, and may endeavour to VeepLeague out, preferably on some plausible excuse which hecould turn to personal political advantage.    I need not say how great a disappointment it would be were that to be thecase, or how seriously it might affect our plans, and I trustsincerely that there may be nothing in 8ivendar&apos;s apprehens-ion.   For all that, and purely as a precautionary measure, Ithinv it well to begin to analyse position which would arise in contrary event, so that you and I can consider at greaterleisure the wise course to follow;..in such circumstances.2.       If Moslem League were to refuse to co-operate there are,as:I see it, two possibilities:- (a) that Jinnah might securemajority for non-co-operation but that, majority provinces -Punjab and Bengal - would breav away from League possiblyaccompanied by elements from other provinces, the League thusbeing disrupted; (b) that Jinnah by basing excuse for non-co-operation on some demand which we are not, repeat not,prepared to concede, such as transfer of Defence to an IndianMember, would provide himself and League with excuse for non-co-operation which would loo1&apos;&apos; sufficiently plausible to out-side world, would enable him to claim that he was as good anationalist.as Congress, and would place Bengal and the punjab in an.awkward position tactically if in face of hisrefusal to co-operate.on such ground they brove away fromLeague and too1&apos;- sides with us.3.       In.the event of situation arising of the League as awhole:declining .to co-operate save on terms which we are notprepared to accept, question arises, what then would be ourwise, course?   Main possibilities as I see.them are:-I. To go ahead with expansion, taking in Mahasabha, Aney,Scheduled Castes,,and SiVhs, if all of them are prepared toco-operate, .and adding -a couple of Moslems who are either nowoutside the.League or are prepared to resign from the League,the places of Clow and Bajpai being made available as alreadycontemplated by us.II..as in I, but making no effort to add any Moslem on theground that with the League and Congress Moslems both non-co-operating we could not hope for anything reallyrepresentative under this head.    In that event we could VeepBajpai and Clow for the present.III. To abandon the idea of expansion, Justlfy^S^^ncl?hi&quot;?by a statement of claims advanced oy.parties, ^e impos^ibi1-ity of &quot;-reconciling them, and the unwisdom oi going ahead in amatter of this importance without tne support of the two principle parties, but in our statement making it clear tn-avwe remain ready to go forward at any time on the basis we had proposed if and when either or both of principal parties was prepared to come in.
4.     I examine&apos;the last alternative as: set. out in paragraphNo.3 above first.   In&apos;favour,.of facing facts and accepting the refusal of both Congress and the Moslem League to co-operate in an expanded Centre, there is first the unreliab-ility of a situation in which, while claiming to satisfyIndian aspirations by such an expansion, we have, the supportof neither of the great parties,, cannot command anything livea majority in the Central Legislature,&apos;and may have to face a determined effort on the part of both the majority parties in that body to make   the new Government looy ridiculous.   AGovernment not containing at least one of the two greatparties could rrt-claim to be really broadly based or to produdegree of association of.popular elements which we-have been anxious to secure.      . &apos;5&quot;.     These are very imuortant considerations. &apos; On the other side there are equally considerations of much substance; wehave&apos; said we will go ahead and that if we cannot obtain.support of those, whom we would li&apos;lre to ta^e in we would.worv with those who would wor^ with us. -Moderate elements inthe country (little.., as you ^now, as I regard their realpolitical importance as being) have criticised us in the pastfor refusing to accept help of our friends and allowing ourcoiicy to be dictated by those who are not prepared to co-operate whether Congress or the Moslem&apos;League; and thatcriticism would be advanced in an aggravated form now since we should have to inform the Mahasabha, Ambedvar, the Si^hsand (if he should prove ready to co-operate) Aney, that fail inco-operation of-major parties or at least one of them wecomid not go ahead with our scheme or implement the tentativeoffer we had made to them.   Secondly some loss of prestige is involved.   Our first offer of an advance of this nature washeld up owing to Congress refusal to negotiate with Jinnah lasNovember.   We should now for a second time have been held up(and after emphasising our intention of going ahead) because amuch more generous offer proved acceptable (for entirely different reasons in each case) neither to Congress nor to theLeague,   Suggestion would certainly be made current that ineffect His Majesty&apos;s Government had surrendered to Jinnah andaccented Moslem League refusal to play as a decisive argument against advance (we could probably-largely meet that criticismby emphasising Congress refusal.to co-operate), and suggestion would further be made (particularly if Jinnah played a cardsuch as that referred to in paragraph 2(b) above) that we had never really intended to go ahead at all, and that we hadrelied on internal differences to excuse us from doing so,although we could easily have met at any rate Moslem League by making concession the importance of which would be represented,as not really major.   Thirdly.if we accept defeat and decide to continue to carry on with present unexpanded Council, wecan feel no confidence that we shall be able indefinitely tohold such a position.    The acute differences between congress and Moslem League and patent testimony they afford to theworld of the extreme difficulty of getting major communitiesto worv together would no doubt to some extent put us rightwith general world opinion and at home. -But-I find it difficuto believe that matter would very long remain&apos;at-that point.We should before long again be under strongest pressure herea -  tJ.J101Tie (more particularly if any internal disturbancewhich there might be in this country could be represented asbeing . one result of frustrated,political ambitions) to tryagain; and to ma^e a more extensive offer; and difficultiesiroro the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government of any improvement on offer already made, are patent to both of us.
Equally from the point of view of India, unless we -definitely were to decide to accept terms of one party andbacv it against others the difficulties in buying in one party save at cost of very substantial difficulty with others are obvious.   Finally a not unsubstantial reflectionon Indian political capacity to worv any form of democratic-government or carry any burden of responsibility would .&apos;.unquestionably be involved in a breakdown such as -that. .under discussion.6.      There is something to be said (on the assumption thatMahasabha, Aney, the Scheduled. Castes and the Slvhs wereprepared to play in such circumstances and to stand up to opposition, of. non-co-operating parties) for first alternat-ive discussed in paragraph No.3 above, which would at anyrate have the appearance of associating popular feelingwith our war effort.   We might be able, without splitting-Moslem League, to detach a couple of good Moslems whowould be a definite strength.   But the resultant Governmentwould be at a great disadvantage in the House and the risvthat. Moslem League, having rejected co-operation onexpanded Council and having ex hypothe si lost a couple oftheir prominent supporters to that Council, would, be at one with Congress in making its life difficult in the Legis-lature cannot be over-looked.    The expanded Cabinet, evenif it contained Mahasabha,. Aney, the Depressed Classes andthe Si^hs would too be nothing li^e the repr esentative bodywe had aimed ate   Nor can we overlook the risv thatconcentrated opposition which co-operating parties mighthave to face might well be more than they could stand andmight result in hamstringing them or neutralising them, as political forces for some time&apos; to come.   On the other hand we should, not have thrown over those who were prepared towor^ with us (that consideration is important on personalgrounds in every case and may be of definite political importance in case of-Sivhs who seem lively to attachconsiderable weight to securing representation of theircommunity in my Executive Council.).   Difficulty of findingplaces for Moslem-League representatives, should moslem league later change their mind and co-operate, cannot&quot;,moreover be overlooved, for any&apos;Moslem ta^en in in theevent of an expansion on the lines of alternative (I) wouldas we both agree have to be taven in on normal tenure.(Clearly we could not expect Moslems, who too1&quot; office in thecircumstances under discussion to help us out at a timewhen. Moslem League was non-cooperating, to readjust on thebasis -that their seats would have to be made available if and when the League was prepared, to. play.   On the otherhand difficulty of retaining them plus a couple of MoslemLrague supporters is obvious and to do so would affect thewhole composition of the Council).7.      Alternative (II) in- paragraph 3 above might on theassumption stated in first sentence of paragraph 6 aboveenable us to fill up for the present with representativescooperation at first without dropping any member of theexisting Executive Council, Bajpai and Clow being Vept in reserve to be dropped if we wanted two places for Moslems &apos;later.   But on the whole it seems to me to be ratherunsubstantial and lively to aggravate Moslems and to beopen broadly speaking to most of the objections stated&apos; inrespect of alternative (I)..
8.        I have considered whether,,failing expansion of executive Council, we could associate public opinion withour war effort merely through War-. Advisory Council.    Iconfess that I feel grave doubt as to whether we could.Ex-hypothesi neither Congress nor.the Moslem League would co-operate; though I dare say. that we could picv up a fewMoslems from outside the League, and we might be able toget, in addition to princes on whom we could rely,representatives of certain functions or communities (ourtas1&quot; in that would of course be eased if 5 while failing tosecure Moslem League, we adopt alternative (i) discussed inparagraph No, 3 above).   We should certainly be pressed togive War Advisory Council wider powers and functions than we at present contemplate.   That could of course beconsidered if necessary.   But I doubt if mere existence ofWar Advisory Council, even with wider powers than you and Ihave discussed, and Cabinet have: approved, would be anyinsurance against strong pressure before long at Home and here for a revival of Question of constitutional advance towhich I have referred in paragraph 5 above.I reserve formulation of any judgment for the timebeing.   I may well be taking a somewhat pessimistic view anit may be (and I sincerely trust will be), that Jinnah when see him will tave a more reasonable line, or that he. may find pressure inside League so strong as to leave him no option but to give us league&apos;s co-operation howevergrudgingly.   In that event all will be well.   Nor need Iemphasise how profoundly on all grounds I should regret it .if we were to be forced off our contract plan, or howessential I thin17&apos; it to do everything in our power to getthat plan through.   But I thinv you will agree that no harmwill be done by this preliminary exploration of situationwhich would face us in contrary event, and I shall welcomeany first reactions that suggest themselves to. you.   Inparticular, (since that is something which cannot.be assessedwith any confidence here) I shall.welcome your own judgment of probable Parliamentary reaction to-various &quot;courses setout in paragraph 3 above.-   If you can throw any light onprobable attitude of Cabinet/ that too&apos;-would be of great assistance to me.   Naturally both&apos; you and 1 have to Veepunpleasant possibilities I -have discussed above continuallyin our minds, even though we may hope not to be. confronted with them, and the more :we- have pondered them in advance,the more lively we are to be- able to reach without delaydefinite and reliable conclusions if unfortunately thatcontingency should arise.
TELEGRAM from Secretary of State to Governor-General dated24th September 1940.1280Personal.   Your telegram dated 22nd September 1933did not reach me till this morning when your interview withJinnah was in progress.   I will therefore await report ofinterview before commenting in any detail and will thentave such soundings as may be useful in the light of thecircumstances.   Provisionally ray own reaction would be infavour of your first alternative if you are faced with the choice.    I feel that the third would amount to aconfession of failure which would tend to encourageintransigent tendencies, while as regards the second Ishould see advantage in taking in a couple of Muslims toshow that we cannot wait indefinitely oh Jinnah&apos;s pleasure.However this is purely tentative.TELEGRAM from Governor-General to Secretary of State dated30th September 1940.2 0Q4-GFollowing is practically full text of resolution passedby Moslem League Wording Committee on September 28th atDelhi and unanimously endorsed by the League Council onSeptember 29th.   Begins; Wording Committee of Moslem league in Bombay meeting on September 2nd after considering theViceroy&apos;s letter dated August 14th to the President,containing specific offer regarding expansion of ExecutiveCouncil and establishment of War advisory Council had requested Viceroy to reconsider the matter and had authorised President&quot; to see^ further information andclarification of controversy on point set out in resolutionsbefore Committee could deal with the offer.   As result ofcommunication of these resolutions to Viceroy he invited the President to meet him on September 24th and after fullfree discussion of points arising from those resolutionssent formal reply dated September 25th.   After giving mostearnest careful consideration to the whole matter, Committeenotwithstanding desire from the very beginning to help the prosecution of war and the defence of India, regret inabil-ity to accept the present offer for the following reasons:(1) Inclusion of only two League representatives inexpanded Executive Council of which neither total strengthnor number of additional members has yet been definitelydetermined, gives no real substantial share in authorityof central Government.(2) No indication has been given of position of Leaguerepresentation if any other party later decided to assistprosecution of war and Government agreed to associate it with Executive Council which may involve substantial modification and reshuffling of Executive.(3) Government do not yet propose- to appoint non-official advisers in Section 93 provinces.    Committee feelthat without the association of League representatives inthe administration of those provinces real effective co-operation of Mussulmans impossible.
(4) proposed War Advisory Council is yet in embryo&apos;,and no information is. available.-regarding constitution,composition and- functions, except that there willprobably be about&quot;20 members, and that the question of setting it up will be considered after expansion of the.Executive Council is complete.(5) That of various points, in Committee&apos;s&apos;rasolutionof September 2nd, only one-relating to panel lias been-satisfactorily met.   Ends.-&apos;;   .       - , t   -2.        According to newspaper.report -Nawab of Chhatariand one other favoured a middle course,&apos;but. there was no real opposition&apos;to the resolution which1was drafted by sub--committee consisting of jinnah, Si^endar Hyat Than,Nawab Ismail Khan, Chaudry Khaliquz Zaman, Nazimuddinand Malik Bar^at All.
Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for india dated 1st October 1940.2010-SYou will have had the resolutions of the moslem league meeting at Delhi.   I fear they entirely confirmsomewhat pessimistic forecast of line which Jinnah mighttave contained in my telegram.    I do not propose to comment any further for a day or two; but it is quiteobvious that the Moslem League are satisfied that theydo not stand to lose anything substantial by standingout so long as they can (as they have done in theirresolution; plausibly impute their decision to fact thatwe were not prepared to grant them equality or majorityrepresentation with Congress in expanded ExecutiveCouncil, and grant what amounts to a deciding voice interms on which Congress, or any other party hereafter tobe admitted to an expanded Council would be allowed tojoin.   Those demands call for no comment from me.    Itwould clearly be out of the Question for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to consider conceding them at any time.2.        You will observe that Jinnah, not for the first time, has copied Congress in basing his rejection partly on our alleged refusal to surrender power.   For presspurposes, the fact that both parties make   that criticismbut that what both parties want is that we shouldconcede to them power to dominate the other.parties, andbacv them in doing so, is gravamen of charge.   I have hada letter from Savar^ar telling me not to ta^e Mahasabhademands too seriously as they are solely designed to offset the demands of Moslem League and will not be pressed if Moslem League do not have their way.    I quiteaccept that that is probably the truth.   But for themoment the Mahasabha, by putting forward these demands,have put themselves on bad ground and a very damagingpresentation of the whole political position could bemade by setting up side by side the demands of Congress,Moslem League and the Mahasabha.    The completeincompatibility of these important parties and smallnessof the prospect of any honest broker , - such as his majesty&apos;s Government - however hard he may try, to get them together would emerge.

TELEGRAM from Secretary of State to^Governor-Generaldated 3rd October 1940.5975Personal.   Cabinet will probably be discussing issues raised in your telegram of 22nd September 1933-3 in the next two or three days.    I myself am still in favour of Course(I) as provisionally indicated in my telegram of 24thSeptember but I should be glad to vnow whether your viewson the issues have since developed further and in whatdirection.In the course of discussion the question is bound to beasved what really representative Muslims you could get whowould disregard the League&apos;s decision.   Can you suggest anynames that you have in mind supposing that Course (I) were followed?   Also in that event what in your opinion would bethe reaction upon the Muslim League as such and upon its future attitude.
