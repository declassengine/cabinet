(40) 250.September 30, 1940.WAR CABINET.FOOD AND THE BLOCKADE.Note by the Minister of Economic Warfare.THE agitation to pass food through the blockade has for the moment dieddown. But, since it may revive, I think my colleagues may be interested to read the attached paper by Professor A. L. Goodhart, an American citizen who isProfessor of International Law at Oxford.H. D.Ministry of Economic Warfare,September 30, 1940.Difficulties of Food Relief in the Last War.THE supply of food to enemy-occupied territories raises problems which are well illustrated by events during the last war. It has been too readily assumed bysome people that no difficulties were encountered then. We have failed to remember that owing to the recalcitrant position assumed by the German and austrian Governments no help was allowed to reach the starving millions in poland and Serbia, and that even in Belgium and Northern France things did notrun at all smoothly.The story of the abortive attempts to relieve Poland is particularlyilluminating. The facts can be found in Command Papers 24 and 32 presented to Parliament in July and September 1916.The negotiations began in the spring of 1915 when the American ambassador in London enquired on behalf of the Rockefeller Foundation whether the Allieswere prepared to allow food-stuffs to be imported into Poland, parts of whichwere then threatened with starvation. The Allies assented to the proposal,provided that the United States Government should officially assume respon-sibility for the proper carrying out of the work. Before further steps could betaken the sinking of the Lusitania occurred, and as a result of the protests then made by the United States Government, the officials at Berlin informed i theRockefeller Foundation that they could admit no relief into Poland underAmerican control. In this connection it is interesting to note that the Germansargued that the destruction of tihe Lusitania was a justifiable act of reprisalagainst Great Britain for &quot;ther inhuman attempt to starve the civil populationof Germany by means of an unlawful blockade.&quot;During the summer of 1915 the situation in Poland became steadily worseas Germany and Austria systematically drained the country Of its food supplies,both by wholesale requisitions of food-stuffs for their armies and by setting up&quot; Import Companies &quot; which removed large stocks, especially into Austria. Onthe 22nd December, 1915, Mr. Herbert Hoover of the Commission for Relief in belgium sent a letter to Sir Edward Grey, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, in which he stated that the sGerman authorities had assured him that,although a minimum ration could be provided in Poland, there was such ashortage of fats that there was a critical danger of incipient famine diseases.The German authorities, he said, were prepared to guarantee that any importedfood would be used exclusively for the civil population, and that they would[21784]
permit the distribution to be carried out by the Belgian Relief Commission. Onthe 5th February, 1916, Sir Edward Grey replied to Mr. Hoover that no schemeof relief could be accepted &quot; until German and Austrian Governments have pro-hibited the export of all food-stuffs from Russian Poland, and have guaranteedthat native stocks of food-stuffs shall not be drawn upon to maintain the occupyingarmies.&quot;No specific reply to this was ever received from Berlin, but on the21st February, 1916, the American Ambassador in London presented a draftproposal in which the German Government seemed, at first sight, to agree to mostof the conditions required by the Allies. Why then did the negotiations breakdown ?The crucial point was that the German and Austrian Governments refusedto deal with Poland as an undivided whole. In effect they were asking that those parts of Poland which were largely industrialised should be fed by the relieforganisations, while those parts which were entirely agricultural should deliverall their surplus produce.to the Central Empires. They attempted to justify thison the ground that in the division of Poland the industrial part had been assigned to Germany, and was effectively separated from the remainder, which was inAustrian hands. They ignored the fact that before the war the Polish cities hadbeen fed by the natural agricultural hinterland, and that there would be littleneed for relief if this commerce were allowed to continue.On the 10th May, 1916, Viscount Grey (as he had then become) wrote to theAmerican Ambassador a memorandum, in which he repeated that Poland mustbe dealt with as a unit, that the German army and constabulary in the occupied territories should not use native supplies, and that the Central Empires shouldcare for the populations of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro, which were being reduced to a state of starvation by the removal of their native food-stuffs.On the 1st June, 1916, a telegram was received from the american ambassador in Berlin stating that the German Government could only contractas to Polish territory in its own control, but that it would use its good offices withAustria concerning Serbian relief. On the 15th June Viscount Grey repeatedfor the third time the Allies&apos; demand that the Central Empires must deal with poland as a whole before any further step could be taken. No reply to this notewas made by the German Government, but instead it began a violent propaganda campaign, in which it accused France and England of starving Poland.The final steps in this dreary story were taken when on the 8th July, 1916,the United States Government officially appealed to all the belligerents to arrangefor the relief of Poland. To this appeal Viscount Grey replied on the 26th Julythat the Allied Governments were prepared to relieve all occupied territoriesindefinitely, provided that the enemy would reserve all produce of the soil of such territories for the inhabitants, and they asked the President of the United states to nominate neutrals to undertake the work of relief. This offer was categoricallyrefused by the German Government on the 29th July, and the negotiations were brought to an end on the ground that relief work was now too late. The german note ended with the characteristic statement, that, owing to the efforts of theImperial Government, &quot; relief action after the 1st October, 1916, can apparentlybe dispensed with.&quot;The history of these futile negotiations was summed up by Viscount Greyin the following words :  &quot;In my opinion the negotiations have thus reached the conclusion whichthe German Government intended that they should reach. There has never been any intention on the part of the enemy to fulfil the obligations restingupon them under the rules of war, as recognised by all civilised countries,towards the inhabitants of the territories occupied by their armies, and their purpose in the whole negotiations was only to confuse issues and throw thegreatest possible amount of odium upon the Allies. The whole discussion,so far as the German and Austrian Governments are concerned, has been only one move in a deep policy of exciting public opinion against the legitimate use of sea power by those who are fighting for the principle of nationality, and, so long as the Central Empires hold any territory belongingto the Allies, they will continue to use the civilians in a thousand towns and villages in France and Belgium, not as non-combatants to be protected, butas hostages and as forced labourers.&quot;
How throughout the rest of the war Germany exploited the unfortunatePolish people and in what a ravished state she left that country at the time ofthe armistice in 1918 need not be described here.The history of the attempts to relieve Belgium and Northern France is centredin that of the Commission for Relief in Belgium, the chairman of which was mr. Herbert Hoover. His work has been admirably described by Dr. VernonKellogg, director in Belgium until 1917, in his book Herbert Hoover (1920).Shortly after the war began in 1914 the food situation in Belgium becamedesperate. Unlike Poland, Belgium is a highly industrialised nation, and at thattime she had only limited stocks of food, large parts of which were seized by theinvading German army. There never was any real hope that the germans themselves would do anything to aid the Belgians, for, as Dr. Kellogg has said,&quot; the Germans would do nothing to help them. Indeed, everything the Germansdid was to make matters worse.&quot; After various negotiations between the belligerent Governments it was agreed in October 1914 that the Commission for relief in Belgium should be allowed to import food into that country, with suitable guarantees that this should be reserved for the civilian population. Oneof the major problems was the financial one, as the Germans refused to allow any Belgian money to leave the country for the purchase of food. As a resultBelgian relief cost the Allies and the United States over  200,000,000 during thecourse of the war. &quot; Of the money and goods for benevolence that came from outside sources more than one-third came from England and the british dominions New Zealand gave more money per capita for Belgian relief than any other country while the rest came chiefly from the United States, a smallfraction coming from other countries.&quot; The Germans seemed to have had some difficulty in realising that this help was really altruistic. &quot; But the Germans,&quot;said Dr. Kellogg, &apos;&apos; never really understood us. One day as Hoover was finishinga conversation with the head of the German Pass-Zentral in Brussels, the Germanofficer said : &apos; Well, now tell me, Herr Hoover, as man to man, what do you get out of all this ?   You are not doing all this for nothing, surely! &apos; &quot;The Germans, on the other hand, instead of helping the work of theCommission, tried in every way to obtain unfair advantages. Although Hollandwas anxious to help its starving neighbour, the Germans kept out food from this source with a ring of bayonets and an electrified wire fence. &quot; Germany lookedon Holland,&quot; said Dr. Kellogg, &quot; as a storehouse of food which might some time,in some way, despite Allied pressure on the Dutch Government, become availableto Germany. Although the French children were suffering terribly, and ceasingall growth and development for lack of the tissue-building foods, the Germanspreferred not to let us help them with the Dutch food but to cling to their longchance of some time getting it for themselves.&quot; More patently dishonest was the attempt made by the Germans in 1915 to seize for themselves part of the belgian and French harvests. In 1916 they suddenly seized the Belgian canal-boat fleet in which the relief food was brought from Rotterdam, demanding that the ReliefCommission should deposit a large sum of money as a guarantee for each boat.This attempted blackmail was only defeated after strenuous negotiations on thepart of Mr. Hoover. In 1917 the German submarines sank a number of reliefships. On this point Professor James W. Garner, a leading American authority on, International Law, has written (International Law and the World War,Vol. I, 330) as follows :-&quot; It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the German war upon Belgianrelief ships was wanton and indiscriminate, and that it was based on theassumption that every neutral vessel sunk and every cargo of foodstuffsdestroyed reduced in that proportion the available world&apos;s supply, and would,in the end, inure to the military advantage of Germany.&quot; It afforded undisputed proof, if further proof were needed, that theGerman Government could not be trusted to keep its promises or observe itsengagements with other Governments, and that with it the sacred principlesof humanity must, in the language of the German war manual and Germantext writers, yield to &apos;. whatever contributes to the attainments of the objectof the war.&apos; &quot;In that same year the Germans, in their Somme retreat, evacuated part ofthe territory in Northern France which they had occupied since 1914. The FrenchGovernment, protesting against the wanton destruction of the trees and crops,
said : &quot; The inhabitants, relative!)7 few in number, who have hot been removedhave been left with a minimum of rations, while the enemy seized stocks supplied by the neutral revictualling commission which were destined for the civilpopulation &quot; (see Eanchille : L&apos;Evacuation des Territoires Occupes par VAllemagnedans le Nord de la France). Finally, as the blockade of Germany became more effective, the policy of requisitions in the occupied territories was;pushed to theextreme limit. &quot; By the spring of 1918,&quot; says Professor Garner (Vol. II, p. 120),&quot;it appears to have degenerated into a system of indiscriminate pillage.Factories were dismantled, growing crops in the fields were requisitioned, and nearly all the livestock in the occupied regions was carried off.&quot; .... Thus,when&apos; the Germans felt that the situation had become desperate, they ignoredthe guarantees they had given against seizing native food.It is unnecessary to add here to the list of German violations except to mention one most important point. When the Belgian Relief Commission beganits work in 1914 the German Government still seemed to recognise that, underthe rules of International Law, it owed certain duties to the inhabitants of the occupied territories. It was only two years later that the Germans adopted theirpolicy of mass deportations and enforced labour. It was then that the german minister of War, von Stein, said : &quot; To-day it is not armies alone who face eachother, but peoples. One cannot leave among his enemies labourers to carry on agriculture and make munitions of war. We have not deported young girls alone,but all the population capable of working &quot; [Gamer. Vol. I, p. 319). AVhen theAllies had originally undertaken that food relief should be sent to Belgium, oneof the strongest arguments that had induced them to take this course was thatotherwise the inhabitants would be forced by hunger to work for the Germans[Kellogg, p. 155). Unfortunately, things did not turn out as they had planned,because towards the end of the war the Germans had found other means of forcingthe people, who were being fed by the Relief Commission, to do war work for them.This story of food relief during the last war has not been told here for thepurpose of stirring up prejudice against the Germans there are enough presentgrounds for this without going back to earlier ones but to illustrate theirmethods and to show how they regard their duties to the inhabitants of the occupied territories. It is interesting that the Germans, who have never beennoted for the originality of their thoughts, are in 1940 repeating exactly the samearguments which they adopted in 1914-18, although they were then conclusivelyrepudiated by the Governments of France, England and the United States. Inthe same way they are taking food from those countries which have a surplus,but are refusing to give any supplies to those, such as Poland and Belgium, whichmay shortly be on the brink of starvation owing to the ravages of the german armies. They have even divided France into two parts, as they did with Polandin 1915, and are refusing to let the one part send food to the &quot;other, although no danger of food shortage could arise if France were dealt with as a unit. TheGermans also are repeating the brutal doctrine that they owe no duty to the peopleof the occupied territories, who, according to von Clausewitz&apos;s traditional policy,may be exploited in a thorough and ruthless manner for the benefit of the invader.Finally, the whole question has been so befogged by German lies -a weaker wordwould not do justice to the energy of their propaganda that many people are left uncertain as to what the facts really are. It was of a similar difficulty thatViscount Grey spoke in 1916 when he said :  &apos;&apos; This was only one instance of the difficulty which the Allied Govern-ments have always had to face in dealing with these relief questions, viz.,that in spite of the statements of American philanthropists, and in spite ofthe appeals apparently made to them by German and Austrian officials,depicting the certainty of starvation in the absence of imported supplies, theenemy Governments have, nevertheless, constantly published official state-ments in their press, minimising the necessity for relief, boasting of themeasures that they had taken to deal with the food problem, and speakingwith contemptuous tolerance of the activities of American relief societies.&quot;One fact, however, emerges clearly from the German statements which cannotbe repeated too frequently there need be no food shortage in the occupied territories if Germany will distribute it on a fair and equal basis.
