^^J^^J^^J^^L^:15 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot;SECRET.W.P. (G) (40)222.2JLST AUGUST.   1940, COPY NO.  \.   WAR CABINET.PROCEDURE FOR GIVING EFFECT TO PRIORITYPOLICY.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIOAS CHAIRMAN OF THE PRODUCTION150UNCflL.1. The priority policy to which the Production council have been working during the last few months is basedprimarily on the decision of the War Cabinet at their meeting on 9th May, 1940 (W.M.(40)116th Conclusions, Minute 1)that &quot;every possible step should be taken to hasten theproduction of anti-aircraft, equipment,  particularly Bofor-s&quot;guns, bomber and fighter aircraft, and fully trained crews,even at the temporary expense of our long-term programme&quot;.2. Effect was given to this policy by the issue on31st May, 1940 of a general Priority Direction to contractors,which at the same time served as a guide to departments and Committees concerned^      An amended Direction was issued on 14th June.      These Directions were designed to secure a vigorous initial impetus in the carrying out of the Government&apos;decision to concentrate on the most urgent defence needs.As a short-term measure,theyhwe been justified by results,and production effort has been rapidly and substantiallyre-directed with satisfactory effect on immediate deliveries^5. But the shortcomings and defects of a general direction to contractors are becoming increasingly evident.      It doesnot in practice afford to contractors the definite guidancewhich it purports to give;    at the same time it causes a quite unnecessary disturbance to the main flow of production,(a) Any general Direction needs to be interpreted;contractors cannot be relied upon to interpretit correctly themselves, and   Departmentalrepresentatives may themselves give wrong orconflicting interpretations.(b) A   general Direction cannot give an individualcontractor the correct guidance as to theorder in which he should tackle the jobs on hisorder book.      Blind obedience to it may in aparticular case be of little or no benefit tothe production in a complete form of the high priority article concerned, while holding up other jobs which,  though in a lower category of priority, are vital to an orderly flow ofproduction.

4. The Production Council therefore consider that the stage has now &quot;been reached v/hen a revised procedure is necessaryto overcome these difficulties and to ensure that priority isgiven to satisfy immediately urgent   requirements while other necessary production goes forward with the maximum of efficiency.5, The Minister of Aircraft Production is not in agreementwith this recommendation of the Production Council.      He has stated that,  in his view, any defects in the working of thegeneral Priority Direction could be eliminated by improvedadministration and by amendments to the form of the Directiondesigned to provide for greater flexibility:    he does not,therefore, support any change in general procedure.6. It has been suggested in the 10th Report of the Houseof Commons Select Committee on National expenditure that the doubts and difficulties of contractors ought to be resolved by the wholesale issue of Priority Certificates in variousgradings, on the lines of the system gradually evolved duringthe last war.      Such Certificates,  issued by a centralauthority would avoid the difficulties of interpretationreferred to at 3(a) above, but would not get over the difficultyreferred to at 3(b).      There was no support on the production council for any proposal in this form.7. The Production Council also considered an alternativeprocedure suggested by Colonel Llewellin M.P.  (Chairman of theProduction and Materials Priority Committee), namely that thegeneral Priority Direction as issued to firms should be withdrawn, that future   priority instructions should be conveyed to Departments    and Committees only, and that industry shouldreceive   guidance on priority in the form of Priority Certificatesto be issued by the Supply Departments:    copies would be sentto the Central Priority Department who would thus exercise ageneral control.      This proposal was designed to give industryclear instructions, while ensuring a real check at the centre.8. After considering the various alternatives the production council decided to adopt the following plan (the Minister of aircraft Production dissenting, for the reasons given inparagraph 5 above) :-(a) the general Priority Direction as issued to firms should be withdrawn and they should be informedthat Priority is in future to be controlled incloser detail:(b) decisions as to the order of priorities, modified as necessary from time to time, should be issuednot to firms,but to the Priority Committees,the Departments, the Area Boards and the RawMaterial Controls for guidance in dealing withallocations and . in framing programmes, etc.(c) Firms should receive any necessary instructions from Departments, who would base such instructions on the general priority decisions and who would act within their allocations of material&apos;and manufacturing capacity.

(d)    Difficulties arising in factories working for more than one department should he resolved asfar as possible &quot;by the Area Boards, otherwise bythe Priority Committees^90 Under this procedure for giving effect to prioritypolicy, the main emphasis is laid on the allocation of materialsas between Departments and on the responsibility of each department for the proper planning of its own production programme.      In so far as individual contractors still need further guidance, this is to be supplied by Area Boards orPriority Committees, to which all the facts of the particular case will be available, and no attempt will be made to resolve such particular difficulties by reference merely to as-^atement of general policy.      Steps are being taken at the sametime to improve and tighten up the arrangements for theallocation of materials in short supply between different departments and uses.10.       The Production Council therefore ask the War Cabinetto approve their adoption of the procedure outlined inparagraphs 8 and 9 above, as they consider that in this way theywill be able most effectively to implement any decisions onpriority policy which may be taken from time to time on theauthority of the War Cabinet or the Defence Committee.(intlldO    A.GCRichmond Terrace, SoW.la21ST AUGUST,  1940.
