SECRET.W^P^G. U40)367.18TH OCTOBER. 1940.COPY NO.TYPES OFTRAINING.TRAINING by industry.TRAINING INGOVERNMENTESTABLISHMENTS.THENEED FORTRAININGCENTRES.WAR CABINET,MACHINE TOOLS FOR GOVERNMENT TRAINING CENTRES.Memorandum b.y the Minister- Without Portfolio.i        ,    At the mooting of the War Cabinet on 24thSeptember I was asked to adjust the demands made for   .machine tools for Government Training Centres&apos;(W.M. (40*)B57th Conclusions, Minute 9)0 ,2* The Minister of Labour advises me that training for the engineering industry is broadly of three different types; &quot; . .(i) Training skilled men to undertake works of the highest degree of .Skill:    this isone aspect of dilution.(ii) Training suitable men and women, most of. - whom have had no previous experience in engineering, by. courses lasting from saytwo to five months to perform operationsrequiring a. fairly high degree. ,of skill.-(iii) Training new entrants to the industry for simple machine - minding processes bycourses usually lasting a week or a fortnight.3.. The Minister considers that training under (i)and (iii) can far better be performed by industry than byany Government Training Scheme.     Many employers haveinstituted training schemes of these types, with the encouragement of his Department, but constant pressure isrequired.     We are all agreed that firms who are working for the Government and are not undertaking training to an extent which is considered,satisfactory, should berequired by order to do so^.4. In the ordnance factories the Ministry of Supplyare co-operating closely with the Ministry of Labour,They are establishing a training scheme which is aiming to turn out 12,000 skilled men per annum.     This correspondsbroadly to training in categories (i) and (ii) above:as demand expands, the ordnance factories will undertakeall the training required in category (-iii).      &quot;TheAdmiralty are arranging to provide 400 electricians forthe Dockyards,  in addition to the large number of skilled men trained in the ordinary way by the Dockyardapprenticeship system and the improvement of unskilled labour.5. The Minister of Labour considers that trainingin category (ii) is better performed in shops or centreswhich are devoted specially to such training. With the modern technique, any such shop or centre-can producej6 This policy has already been endorsed by theWar Cabinet (W.M*(40)262nd Meeting, Conclusion (n))1

The Minister is expandiiig his training centresup to a total of 40 which with full treble shiftingwould represent an output of some 250,000 per annum for all engineering occupations, and considers it essential that this training should-ihe pressed forward at once in order to supply the trained workers whowill be needed for production with the expansion of our programme next year.    The Ministry&apos;s centres trainmen to become not merely machine-operators, butoperator setters, who are in great demands7. The Minister has asked that his Centres shouldacquire some 3,000 machine tools of different types tobe supplied within the next 30 weeks., 750 new tools and 2,250 second-hand tools0    He asks that the2,250 second-hand tools should be allocated to him as required during the next 30 weeks by the machine tool Controller, and that up to this number he should.have absolute priority,    He asks that, until the 750new tools&quot;c^ari -be supplied, he should &quot;&quot;be allotted a Yatrshare of all new tools which become available, say lQfc.8. The Minister of Supply supports this requestgenerally so far as second-hand tools are concerned,and recommends that they should be allocated by the machine Tool Controller for Ministry of labour require-ments as they become available, having regard only toany special claims from the Services where it isclear that vital production would be immediately benefited.He points out that the supply of second-hand tools is limited and that it is doubtful whether the demands ofthe Training Centres can be fully met from this source.As to new tools, he would be raady to make some contribution at the expense of immediate production forwhich he is responsible, if the other production department would take the same line.9. The Minister of Aircraft Production feels very strongly that every single available machine tool shouldbe put into production, and that the utmost pressure shouldbe brought on production firms to do their Own training.The First Lord-of the Admiralty is in general agreementwith the Minister of Supply as to the allocation of second-hand machine tools.    The Royal Dockyards, whosetraining commitments are already heavy, will not, however,be able to spare any tools for training elsewhere&apos;.&quot;;&quot; If thedemand for new machine tools for the Ministry of Labourcentres is cut down to the bare minimum the First Lord isprepared to help with these also, provided, not merely the other production departments do likewise, but also thlany diversion of new machine tools from production department to the Ministry of Labour is strictlyproportionate to the known demands of those Departmentsupon the potential supply of such tools.
^MMENDATIONS.    10. I myself agree with the Minister of labour that, however, much we push on. with factory training,it cannot cover the whole field.      This form of train-ing itself slows up productions    it also requires timeto organise, whereas the Ministry of Labour Centresare already planned and ready to operate as andwhen the machine tools become available for them.      Iam satisfied,  therefore, that unless we can go some wayto meet the demands of the Minister of Labour the long-term production programme will suffer-,11. I consider that every effort should be madeto meet the demand for 2,250 second-hand tools.      Ifthis demand wore to be given an absolute prioritywe should run. the risk of interfering with urgently needed   immediate production in some special cases,and I should prefer, therefore,  to leave discretion tothe Machine Tool Controller to deal with cases of thiskindo     I suggest that a montly report should besubmitted to me showing the extent to which thedemands for second-hand machine tools are being met,and so far as they are being refused,  the nature ofthe production work which has been given preference.12. The Minister of Labour claims that he musthave a certain proportion of new tools,  so that thelatter part of the training can be given on. toolssimilar to those in use in production and capableof working to the standard limits.      One way of helping to meet the demand for new tools would be to modify the training scheme of the Minister of Labour so thatthe training needing new tools eante carried out inthe factories.      This might hot be possible to the full extent;    if the Minister!s training scheme is tocontinue at full strength, it would then be necessaryfor the Production Departments each to make a. smallcontribution of now tools for the Minister&apos;s training scheme for a limited period of time,  at the end of whichthe situation could be again reviewed.      Unless train-ing is pressed forward, the supply of skilled labouressential for next year&apos;s programme will not be forth-coming,      it seems to me,  judging the problem in itswider aspects, that it would be less disadvantageousto lose production during the winter months thanrisk a considerable postponement of production for theGovernment^ war programme next year.      In the last resort, the matter is one of defence policy to be judged by reference to the relative strategic values of immediate and prospective production.Ao Go18TH OCTOBERo  194-0.
