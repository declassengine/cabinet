C.A,BI,NET.MEMBERS OF THJC BRITISH .UNIQN DETAINED UNDER&apos; &apos;     DEFENCE REGULATIONIW.&apos; , REVIEW OF .TSEIR CASES BY THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE APPOINTED INPURSUANCE OF THAT REGULATION^ :Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1.  :. . Towards the end of May, 1940, the Government decided to order the detention of the leaders, both national and district, of theBritish Union because it was felt that the organisation was a potential danger to the security of the. State.     The organisation had shown by its publications and by the pronouncements of itsloaders.that It was opposed to the Government&apos;s policy in going towar, and,was in favour of a negotiated peace, while the leaders &quot;of  -the Movement were known to have had close association with theloaders, both of the&apos; Fascist and the Nazi&apos; systems.      The Movement alsoadvocated,the establishment of an authoritarian system of governmentin this country.In May, 1940, there was of course,  the threat of immediate,invasion of this country, and prompt action had to be taken to^ dealj. with ah. organisation such as the British Union which was capable ofI being used.for purposes prejudicial to the public safety.      There wasno time to investigate the activities, character and history of eachof the scores of men and women who were officials of the Union or taking an active part in organising its branches;    and,it was decidedthat the only effective way of preventing the organisation being usedfor a dangerous purpose: was to order the detention of all those knownto the authorities to have taken an active part in furthering the objects.of the British Union.     For this purpose It was assumed thatall office holders of the Movement had taken such an active part.As a consequence of this decision, some, 400 persons were immediatelydetained, and Subsequently, as the result of further reports fromChief Constables and M.I.5,  the detention of additional&apos;members ofthe Union has been ordered.      In all some 750 persons have been detained in pursuance of Regulation l8B because of their association with the British Union.2,&apos;        On the 10th July my predecessor made an Order under defence regulation 18AA, the effect of which is to make illegal any activitieson behalf of the British Union (including the summoning of meetings,advertising meetings, attending meetings, inviting persons to join the- organisation, or contributing to the organisation).      This Ordertwas made because my predecessor was satisfied that the persons in control of the. British Union were sympathetic with the system of governments of the enemy and that there was a danger of the utilisation of the organisation for purposes prejudicial to the public safety, thedefence of the rea&apos;lr.i, the maintenance of public order and the efficientprosecution of the war.     The Order was not made before July because itwas thought that hidden loaders might come to light to take the places of those who &quot;were arrested in May.
5. Persons detained in pursuance of this regulation have a statutory right to make objection against their detention to an advisory Committee which is presided over by Mr. Norman Birkett.The first of those cases heard by this Advisory Committee was thatof Sir Oswald iiosley;    The Advisory Committee, having satisfieditself that the British Union- Organisation was of the characterdescribed in Defence Regulation/ 18AA, and that there was thedanger of utilisation of the organisation for purposes prejudicial to the public safety recommended the continued detention of SirOswald: and they have made similar recommendations about his. moreprominent supporters0Most of the 750 persons detained under this regulation haveexercised their right to. make objections to the Advisory Committee.By the end of October the Advisory Committee had heard 317 cases and had recommended the release of 199 and the continued detention of 118 personSc    They still have some 400 cases to review and, ifthe proportion of recommendations for release remains the same, itis expected that ultimately the Committee will recommend therelease of about 60% of the persons whose detention was originallyordered because of their association with the-British Union,4..      .  It may be asked-why the Advisory&apos;Committee have seen fit torecommend, the release of so high a proportion of cases. , The answer is that the continued detention of a person under this regulationis not  justified unless it can be shown not only that the personhad. taken part in the activities of the Union, but that by reasonof his or..her activities It is necessary to exercise control over,him.    The examination of the individual cases by the AdvisoryCommittee has shown that a substantial number of the localofficials who- had been detained as a measure of precaution cannotbe regarded as dangerous peopleAt the time of their detent ion-..there was nc prohibition against taking part - in the activities ofthe British union,,  and the Advisory Committee reports that in manycases the persons who have appeared before them have protestedstrongly     and the Oonimittee believe truthfully - that had theOrder prohibiting the activities of the British Union been made atan earlier date,  they would have discontinued any ^association, withthe Union,    Uany of the persons detained had no association or.sympathy with Germany and were unaware of the implications of SirOswald Mosley*s pro-Nazi:-activities.    The Committee are satisfiedthat in a number of oases the persons appearing before them were entirely patriotic an-d-anxious to assist, the war effort in- thiscountry,  some of them &quot;haying been attracted to-the British Unionoriginally by its professedly ultra-British appeal,        A number, of&apos;loni were, before the outbreak of warf and even after the outbreakof war-,  in favour of keeping Grout Britain out of Europeanentanglements .and believed in the possibility lity of a negotiated peace,but &apos;the Committee&apos;&apos;find that many of these have changed their&quot; mindssince, the overrunning of Holland, Belgium and Prance, and now&apos;recognise that it .is the duty of every British subject to -do his utmost-fo secure the defeat of Germany&apos;.-    Toe Committee- report that many of- the persons-detained are men or women of little educationor intelligence with no powers of deader-ship and too Insignificantto be regarded as dangerous.    Cases have come&apos;, to light of. trade unionists who joined- the British Union in the belief that..it was another form of Trade -Union, while in other cases a man detainedbecause he was alleged- to be a leader was.-.shown to be in fact thesolitary member of the organisation in his. district&apos; .--        .. &apos; JFor all these reasons the I advisory Committee are satisfied,that&apos;,  in a large huiiber of individual. oases .which come before them,there is ho necessity, for the continue a detention of the&apos; individual&apos;
5, Among those recommended for, release by the AdvisoryCommittee, there is a number (some 100) whose release is opposed bythe Security Services on the general ground that they are officials of the organisation, that their release may encourage the rank and file who are now inactive and that the result may be the growth ofsome propaganda of a defeatist character,,        These views have beendiscussed by the Home Defence (Security) Executive and theExecutive are of opinion that where release is recommended by theAdvisory Committee and where there are no special grounds fordetention except the fact that the. person detained had been anofficer,or active member of the British Union, the AdvisoryCommittee&apos;s recommendation ought to be accepted.6, All cases, are, of course,  carefully reviewed by the HomeOffice and no member of the British Union is released from detentionunless I am myself satisfied that he can. safely be released,,    Insome cases I have asked the Advisory Committee to reconsider the irrecommendation,While in other cases the persons released are warned that, should they engage in any British Union activities,  they will&quot;be   liable, not only to prosecution under Defence Regulation 18AAwhich prohibits such activities, but also to a fresh order of detention.    In special cases release is made subject to conditionsas to residence and as to reporting to the police,    In some cases Imay find it necessary to differ from the recommendation of theAdvisory Committee,7. The policy of releasing     a high proportion of members ofthe British Union after an individual review of their cases may be criticised on the grounds that the persons released may form cellsfor the revival of the Fascist organisation, that a person who hadonce lent his support to this movement cannot be trusted to be loyalto this country in all circumstances and that the release of alarge ,number of former members of the British Union will give rise to public uneasiness,8.      .   On the other hand the release of those persons who,  after careful examination of all the information, have satisfied theAdvisory Committee that they are not dangerous and that their continued detention is accordingly not necessary in the publicinterests seems to me to be the only policy which it is open to me,as Home Secretary,  to pursue,    I have come, to this conclusion on thefollowing grounds, namel3?&quot;(a) The information obtained by the police and by Mil,5 showsthat the British Union as an organisation is now defunct.    Thereare indications that in one or two places attempts are beingmade to carry on subterranean activities, but these activities are being closely watched with a view to the arrest of the individuals concerned at the appropriate moment,(b) The regulation provides that a monthly report shoudd besubmitted to Parliament as to the number of cases in which theHome Secretary has declined to follow the advice of theAdvisory Committee      If I have to report to Parliament that Ihave refused to accept that advice in a large number of cases,a serious attack may develop on the power,  vested in the HomeSecretary by the Regulation;,,  of ordering the detention ofpersons without trial,,    The only safeguard against invasion bythe Executive of the liberty of the subject is the right of theperson detained to make objection to an independent Tribunal and(whilst I must reserve my re gbt of final judgment),  if theadvice of the Advisory Committee is rejected In a large numberof cases,  it will be represented that the safeguard provided byParliament is illusoryc
(c )     &apos; While the Chairman and members of the Advisory Committee &quot;fuXhvirecognise that the. final responsibility rests with the &quot;Home        y)\: Secretary and ,that special cases may occur in which the HomeSecretary -will&quot;feel unable to accept their recommendation, theycould not be expected to continue their work if there were such, .numerous rejeetions of - their recommendations as to show acomplete. divergence of view or. general principles between the &apos;Home - Sac retary and the Committee.,    If the Chairman and many members of- the Committee were to resign on such an issue, serious difficulty would.be created.It will be noted, that the Committee agree that the british union;was a dangerous organisation and agree that a substantial number of its adherents should remain&apos; in detention.    If thereforethere were numerous rejections of their recommendations,&apos; theinference would be that the Home Secretary could.not trust.theCommittee&apos;to assess the character of the individuals who come before them and to distinguish between those who are dangerous and those who are not.--(d)(e)Although-when the releases are considered in bulk there are .obvious objections to the release of so large a number of. people who have been actively associated with this dangerousorganisation, examination of individual cases in which the&apos;Committee recommend release makes it difficult: to dissent as a ,.general rule from the Committee s view thatihdivi du a! c annotbe re garde d;&apos; as dangerous, that he has: been a dupe of Mosley!s .-propaganda, and that; he is at worst harmless, and unimportant andat best anxious to help the country in.its war effort.The prolonged detention of persons who have satisfied theAdvisor;/ Committee individually that they are not dangerous willgive   rise to a sense of grievance. . The persons detained may be converted from loyal subjects to disgruntled and embittered   &apos;  .--persons and when they are ultimately released they, may form an,..undesirable and potentially dangerous elementanhemnrar.9* I accordingly propose - as- a general policy     to authorise&apos; the-&apos;release of persons whose release is recommended by the AdvisoryCommittee9t notwithstending that this policy may result in the releaseof a high proportion of the persons detained^    The adoption of thispolicy does not,  of course-,- mean that all recommendations will be contrary, as stated earlier, eachconsidered on its merits, and wheneveautomatically^ accepterecommendation will be - care. w.ask the Comm.:re sponsibil 1.1necessary&apos; i shallor shall take theo ceeojto re o c ns i ele rrejecting it.recommendationBritish Union aetivitieunder the Deferme Regulationalso to a fresh order of detemade subject to conditions asthe   oolice-    In most cases are warned that should theythey will be liable not onlyin anyprosecutionwiJicn prohibits such activities butti oiu    In special cases the release isto residence and as to reporting toshall be unconditional,.Advisory Committee thatintent and can now be. toUnion,,however,  it is right that too releasesince .11 is based on the view formed by thethe individual in question has no disloyal-listed to renounce all association with theHome Office,19th hovember
