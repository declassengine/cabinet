THE MAN POWER REQUIRED IN THE ENGINEERING INDUSTRY TO SUPPORT THE PRESENT SERVICE PROGRAMMES.

Report by the Minister without Portfolio after discussing with the Minister of Aircraft Production, the Minister of Labour and National Service, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Supply.

1. We have now discussed this matter further as invited by the War Cabinet at their meeting on 19th November, (W.M.(40)291st Conclusion, Minute 10).

2. Before agreeing that the proposals by the Chairman of the Man Power Requirements Committee set out in paragraph 4 of my note W.P.(G)(40) 296, "provide a basis for action and should be adopted", we consider that they should be amended as follows:-

(i) Paragraph (e) should be redrafted to reads:-

" 575,000 of the additional force of 700,000 required in engineering will need training or experience before they can produce, and this indicates what is required of the Minister of Labour&apos;s complete training scheme.    The Ministry of Labour with its present equipment and programme cannot train directly (in Government training centres or technical institutions) by August 1941, more than about 130,000 persons,  some of whom the employers will then want to train further. As part of the whole scheme, therefore, four-fifths of the training to be given, in addition to up-grading, must be given in the factories.    The Government, through the Ministries concerned, must see that this scheme is carried out and that each part of industry contributes its proper quota."

(ii) Paragraph (k) should be confined to the first sentence, the remainder being deleted.

3. Subject to the above, we agree to recommend that the conclusions of the Production Council and the Economic Policy Committee as set out in paragraph 5 of my note W.P.(G)(40)296 should be endorsed. Unless any of our colleagues intimates a wish that the matter should be discussed further in the War Cabinet, we propose to proceed on this basis.
