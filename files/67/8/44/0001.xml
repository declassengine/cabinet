DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC LxAJESTY&apos; 8 -GOVERN! JJUT&apos;C R E T.JG)(4Q)  244. COPY NO:^ .SEPTEMBER,  1940,7 A R     CABINETMILITARY TRAINING FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for War.My colleagues will recall that when the cabinet discussed the use of Universities in connection with militarytraining - &apos;7.M.(40) 231st Conclusions, Minute 2 - the questionof compulsory military training for students,was considered.The problem presented many difficulties, and it was decidedto drop the idea.     At the same time, it is the view of the vice--Chancellors, and I support it, that it should be made clear to students that it is their duty to prepare themselves for military service.      I propose, therefore, to make thefollowing announcement :-Young men from 18 years of age onwards, who have noother obligations, are urgently needed in Home defence units, and it is their duty to undertake such service,if they can do so.     University students cannot in themain undertake such service without undue interferencewith their studies.     The continuance of certain formsof education to university standards is, however,essential at this time in the interests of the nation,and it is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government thatyoung men should not be deterred from such studies bythe feeling that they should be more actively engagedin national defence.     They have, therefore, decidedto expand the contingents of the Training Corps at universities, so that every student may enrol in thisCorps and thereby obtain basic military training.They place the highest value on service in TrainingCorps at Universities, and they urge Universitystudents to regard it as their duty to enrol and serve in the contingent of the Training Corps at theirUniversity,,The War Office,23rd September, 1940,..
