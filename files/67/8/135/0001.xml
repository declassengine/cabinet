(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTYOF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNIIENT ) .SECRET. .W.P.(G;(aO) 335.   -23RD DECEMBER. 1 9UO.WAR. CABINET., ..RECRUITMENT FOR FIRE. POLICE AND-CIVIL DEFENCE SERVICES.Memorandum. by the Lord President of the. Council..  - - In.accordance with the decision reached by the WarCabinet at their meeting today (W.M.(ko)309th Conclusions,Minute -10) I have discussed this problem with the Ministerof. Labour, the Minister of. Home Security and .the AdjutantGeneral;   and agreement has been reached as follows1o.The advantages of the procedure originally suggestedby the. Minister of Home Security (by which menelecting to join the Civil... Defence Services wouldbe called up for military service and relegatedto Class Wo Army Reserve) are outweighed by the^administrative objections to such a system.     The.  Minister of Home Security agrees to withdraw this. proposals -- 2. The. time available, when a man is registering for  jmilitary service is not sufficient to enable hj.m\to be given a detailed explanation of the \conditions of service in the Civil Defence Servic&apos;^ssThis detailed explanation, and the exercise of adefinite option in favour.of the Civil defence services, must be deferred until the stage atwhich the man is called up for medical examination.3. Full publicity will, hov/ever, be given forthwith tothe new procedure by which a man called up &quot;formilitary service will be given the option to joincertain of the. Civil Defence Services, as atpresent he has an option of volunterring for theRoyal Navy or for the Royal Air Force.The Services to which this system will be appliedare - (a) The Auxiliary Fire Service, (b) police and (c) Stretcher Parties.      It is agreed thatunskilled labour to supplement the work ofRescue Parties can most conveniently be obtained by drawing on the Stretcher Parties and other sources by local arrangements.h. The Ministry of Labour undertake that each man, onregistering, will be handed a leaflet (to beprepared by the Ministry of Home Security) explain-ing the conditions of service in the threeCOPY NO. ^   Vs-
Services-mentioned .In-&apos;the preceding paragraph,   and making it clear that if-he-elects to join any of these Services,and is accepted for enrolment, he will &quot;be regarded asexempt from&quot;military service so long as he continues inthe Service for which he has been accepted.       &apos;-If at the stage of registration a man indicates that he wishes to join one of the Civil Defence Services,the local office of the Ministry of Labour will refer himforthwith to the local authority.At the subsequent stage when a man is called up for medical examination, he will be further reminded of his right to exercise at that stage a definite option infavour&quot;of one or other of these Civil Defence Services.5. The Ministry of Home. Security will devise machinery in consultation with the Ministry of Labour, for diverting-men who volunteer under this procedure to local authoritiein whose areas there are vacancies for full-time personnel in.the Civil Defence Service which the man wishes to join.6. The Ministry of Labour will consider the possibilitof diverting the relatively few men who have alreadyregistered but have not yet been medically examined.      Itis understood that there would be difficulty in releasingto the Civil Defence Services men who have been medically examined and are now waiting to be posted to the Array.7. The Adjutant General will consider sympatheticallythe possibility of releasing to the Police Service acertain proportion of the trained]policemen now serving with the Military Police or the Brigade of Guards.      TheMinistry of Home Security will devise, in consultation witthe Adjutant General, machinery (similar to that already employed by the Ministry of Labour in seeking the release from the Army of skilled tradesmen required in war productfactories) by which they will apply for the release of selected men previously employed by the Police Forces whicnow urgently require their services.     This will have theeffect of spreading these releases over a period, and will thus give an opportunity of training other men to take theplace of those released.8. The Minister of Home Security will prepare specific proposals for legislation designed to apply directcompulsion in the matter of recruitment for the civil defence Services, and will submit these proposals to theWar Cabinet in the near future,J.A.Privy Council Office,23RD DECEMBER,  19^0,
