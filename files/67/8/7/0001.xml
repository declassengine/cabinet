COPY NO.If A r   g a biiei,production   council.holidays.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1.       A further statement of Government policy on holidays has in my opinionbecome necessary .*    The general policy is still governed by the statement of13th June, (see Appendix i) which deprecates &quot;complete stoppages&quot;, even forone-day holidays, either in war industries or in other industries.   This policy was devised with a view to the war situation as it then existed, and at thattime the French Government vere considered likely to be placed in difficultiesby any appearance that this country had any thought of holidays.2.       Since then,  owing to the exhaustion from which workpeople arc suffering,a widespread feeling that some measure of holidays is necessary has become evident among both managements and employees.    It has been found impracticable to interfere with complete stoppages in a number of cases (e.g., in connectionwith Glasgow Fair Yfcek) or with proposals to resume Lancashire Wakes weeks;many inquiries are being received from managements as to Y/hether stoppages forholidays can be officially agi-eed to;    and it has become very difficult todeal with such inquirers by referring them to a Government statement which isregarded as out of date and known to be inconsistent with what has sincehappened in a number of instances or in important areas.3.       The statement of lpth June did envisage the talcing of holidays where these were granted, in rotation, but in a number of cases firms&quot; have submittedrepresentations to the effect that owing to the nature of their organisation or processes a sj^stem of staggered, holidays is impracticable or would involved.isproj5ortionate dislocation, and that from the point of view of output itwould be preferable for the whole concern to close down at one time to allowworkpeople to have the relaxation which they need, and facilitate theoverhauling of plant and machinery.4.       There is a growing accumulation of evidence in my Department and also, Iunderstand, in the Ministries of Supply and Aircraft Production, Ahat some measure of holidays is desirable in order to allow workers who have been undervery groat pressure to have a brcAk before the arrival of the autumn and winter,thus restoring the efficiency of both manual workers and supervisory staff,and reducing the risk of discontent, disturbance of good relations in industry,and a woeutcning of morale as a result of the continuing strain of work.   Ifthis breelc is not given output is likely to go down.5*       Thero is also a danger that holidays will be crowded into the four or fivevrcoks in September and early October, with consequent strain on transport andother facilities, unless the Government announce without dealy that the ban whichit has imposed on complete stoppages does not now hold good where, in theinterests of production, ma^a-geracnts are of opinion that the best plan is to close down for a short period.6*       I accordingly suggest that I should at once, on behalf of the Government,issue a new statement on holidays on the lines of the draft in Appendix II.-   ..

APPENDIX I.15th June, 1940.x 12. Major Sir George Davies - To aslc the Parliamentary-Secretary to the Ministry ofLabour and National Service,whether he is now in a positionto make a further statement with regard to the arrangement of holidays,,Mr. AsshetoUsThe Government have asked for a general cancellation orpostponement of holidays during this period of crisis in orderthat there may be no interference with the production ofmunitions and that transport should be left free as far aspossible for the needs of evacuation and civil defence.      the response has been magnificent and production has been greatlyaccelerated,,     But we must beware of any slackening of momentum.As far as is humanly possible we must for some time to comecontinue at the same high pressure the output of urgent war requirements of every kind,,It must be recognised that seven day working without adequate periods of rest for individuals is not an efficientmethod of production if continued for any length of time.Periodical rest periods for individuals are necessary even onurgent priority work, if output is to be maintained at thehighest level.     Arrangements should be made to provide suchrest periods and they should include the building up as quickly as possible of a staff which will allow one day1 s restperiodically for the personnel,,     The details of thearrangements that may be practicable will vary from industry to industry;    the managements of the various plants - and the associations of employers and workers should set themselves atonce to the. immediate solution of this problem,,As isegards holidays the cance!3.ation or suspension of complete stoppages must hold good0     This will apply not only toholidays extending over several days but also to day holidayssuch as the August Bank holiday, which it is proposed to cancelby Defence Regulation, and other one-day holidays.When it is the practise for holidays to be taken in rotation by individuals and thus to be spread over a period ofmonths, it should be considered whether they v/ould interfere inany way with urgent war requirements or with other urgent rquirements for transport or other essential services.      Ifthey would so interfere, they should not be taken now.     when this is not so, however, it will in most cases be better thatthey should be taken as arranged,,Those spending holidays in the country who are able tohelp in work on the land are urged to make enquiries locallywhether their services can be used in this way0In trades covered by the Trade Boards&apos; Acts, agricultureand the road haulage industry there is a legal obligation to give an annual holiday in certain cases within specified months ofthe year.      Steps will be taken   so far as necessary to extend the period within which such holidays must be given or otherwiseto adjust the legal obligation to the needs of the situation.Questions will arise as to the rate of wages for work doneon days that would ordinarily be holidays,,     It is the view ofthe Government that such questions should be settled inaccordance with any provisions in agreements relating to thismatter.-I- /APPENDIX II
appendix ii.PROPOSED STATEMENT.In a statement made in Parliament on the 13th June,the Government indicated its view that there should not forthe time &quot;being he any complete stoppages of work for holidaysin any establishment, but that where it was the practice forholidays to be taken in rotation by individuals and thusspread over a   period of months they might be taken as arranged, if it appeared that this would not interfere inany way with urgent war requirements or with other urgent rquirements for transport or other essential services.It remains the Government&apos;s view that in presentcircumstances complete stoppages should not take place atestablishments where holidays in rotation can be arrangedwithout detriment to production or essential services.It Is, however, recognised that in certain establishments itmay be desirable in the interests of production or the efficient conduct of the business to close the workscompletely for a   short period and in such cases the Governmentwould not regard a stoppage of short duration as contrary togeneral policy.     The essential consideration in determining the desirability of a short holiday is whetherit will assist in maintaining or increasing production orefficiency.
EXTRACT FROM DRAFT CONCLUSIONS OF A MEETING OF THE&apos; PRODUCTION COUNCIL, HELD ON THE 5TH AUGUST. 1940.&quot;&quot; ( P.X. (40) 9TH CONCLUSIONS) .HOLIDAYS. 1.    THE PRODUCTION COUNCIL had before them aMemorandum (P.X,(40) 45), in which the Minister- of Labour and National Service requested authorityto issue a further statement of Government policy on holidays, on the lines of the draft attachedto the Memorandum as Appendix 11*The Memorandum stated that there was a growingaccumulation of evidence to tho effect that workers who had been under great pressure stood in urgent need of a break &quot;before the winter.     If such a breakwas not given, output was likely to go down.     Itwas proposed to announce that the ban which theGovernment had imposed on complete stoppages of workin factories, etc., did not now hold good in caseswhere, in the interests of production, managementswere of opinion that the best plan was to closedown for a short period.THE CHAIRMAN said that the Prime Minister had asked that the draft statement should be brought before the War Cabinet on the following day.In discussion it was pointed out that it wouldbe advisable to amend the draft in such a way as tobring it out more clearly that there must be noslackening in production or other essential.services.    &quot;Holidays must be given without creating a holiday atmosphere.&quot;    The purpose for which theywere being granted was in order that productionmight be increased, not diminished.     The announce-ment might well end on this note.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that ho entirely agreed.     He would arrangefor the Statement to be amended on the lines suggested.     As regards the date of the Statement,he now thought that it might be best if it weredeferred until the following week.THE PRODUCTION COUNCIL:-(i) recommended the War Cabinet to give ageneral approval to the proposals ofthe Minister of Labour and NationalService in P.X.(40) 45.(ii) invited the Minister to revise thedraft Statement attached to P.X.(40) 45as Appendix II, on the lines suggested at &apos; X* above.(iii) took nbte that it was how the Minister&apos;sintension to issue tho new Statementduring the week beginning the 11thAugust.
