this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government secret .p*(g)(40) u.s.&quot; copy no.    ^28th august, 1940 WAR cabinetagricultural prices for tie season 1940-41Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries.     The Food Policy Committee has been considering agricultural prices forthe season 1940-41.     Agreement has been reached except on two points - Fat cattle and Pigs.2.     Increased prices for agricultural products came into force on July 1stlast. .  They were designed to cover (l) the rise in agricultural wages, (2) therise in other costs and (3) encouragement to maximum effort.     Some of mycolleagues on the Food Policy Committee feel the increase was more than wasnecessary.     I doubt this as the increase in wages has turned out to be greaterthan was allowed for and other costs have increased since July 1st and are still,of course, increasing.     I made it clear, on June 29th in my broadcast that theGovernment reserved full right to fix prices for 1941 either upwards or downwards.Frima facie, however, stability of agricultural prices, is desirable so long as these prices do not damage national interests.3.     I was authorised by the lord President&apos;s Committee to increase fat cattleprices on 1st July up to 15 per cent.     In fact, I persuaded the farmers to be content with llg- per cent, for the months of July and August.     The Minister ofFood has subsequently (August 1st) increased feeding stuff prices by an amountestimated at  7 million a year, of which about  2 million represents an increase on imported feeding stuffs.     The producers of fat. cattle claim that on this groundalone they would be entitled to ask for an increase over the 11^- per cent.4.     The Minister of Food wishes on the contrary to reduce this llg- per cent,to 5 per cent.     The best offer he has since made is 8 per cent.     There is normallya seasonal decline in prices in the autumn and a rise in the spring and to secureregular marketing a range of 10s. between autumn and spring prices is contemplated.The present price (August 25th) of fat cattle is 65s.6d. a cwt. (for the standardgrade).     The Minister of Food&apos;s latest offer would mean a reduction to 59s.6d. bythe third week of October, a fall of 6s. a cwt. compared to the seasonal fall of. on the pre-July scale.5.     Such a drastic reduction in price (when the farmers feel that if anythingthey are entitled to an increase) cannot fail to have serious repercussions on thefood production campaign.     Practically every farmer is interested in a small way or in a big way in the price of fat cattle - even a dairy farmer.     There arethousands of farmers today; members of District Committees engaged in making the farm Survey and in encouraging and directing their neighbours to get on with theincreased food production campaign.     It is not altogether a pleasant task, it involves great calls on their own time and is being done voluntarily and withexemplary good will.     The farming community generally feel today that the Julyprices though not generous are at least reasonable.     Their confidence has been restored.     They are undoubtedly willing and ready today to make the effort required of them.     I submit that it would be a grave mistake to jeopardise this state ofaffairs, for the comparatively small sum of money involved (viz.  1.7 million).6.     Some of my colleagues are impressed, I feel, by the arguments of themembers of the Scientific Committee.     The latter stress the need for maintaining^nd, if possible, increasing our milk supply.     I agree wholeheartedly.   But theygo on to urge that this will be endangered, if feeding stuffs run short, by farmersusing these feeding stuffs for fattening cattle instead of for milk.    My advisershave always maintained there was no evidence to support this fear.     Thescientists&apos; case rested largely on some estimates portending a reduction in thenumbers of our dairy cattle, estimates which have since proved to be wrong.     I donot believe there is any danger such as my colleagues apprehend (unless the prices for fat cattle were raised far higher than they stand today) .1.
7.-    I recommend, therefore, that the prices for beef cattle shsuld be stabilised for the coming 12 months on the basis of an increase of 11-g- per cent,over the pre July figure.8.     As far as pigs are concerned the present price is 21s. a score forbaconers.     The Minister of Pood wishes to reduce this.to 19s. 6d. from October 1st,The farmers allege that 21s. a score is not a remunerative price in view of therise in their costs of production, especially in view of the increase since August 1st in the price of feeding stuffs.     We have always contemplated that some reduction in the total number of pigs would be inevitable this autumn in view ofthe feeding stuffs position.    A price of 21s. a score will, in my view, secure this and should maintain the numbers of pigs at that reduced level.     A drop to19s.6d. may well, in my opinion, result in such grave discouragement to pigkeeping that the numbers will be reduced below the level necessitated by the feeding stuffs situation.     This is primarily a matter for the Minister of Pood.I merely call my colleagues&apos; attention to it in view of the probable publicoutcry.9.     I attach a schedule of the various fat cattle prices involved (Appendix I)and a note on the place of cattle in agriculture, and their importance to the foodproduction campaign (Appendix II).(Intld.)

APPENDIX II.The cattle industry is of widespread importance in   our agriculturalsystem.   It is bound up with many different types of farming.   Farmers who breedstores in Wales and the west and North, the farmers in the Midlands and other districts -who fatten them on the grass and the farmers in the Eastern countieswho fatten them in the yards are all vitally concerned with the prosperity of the cattle trade.however much we accept the views of the scientists that it is moreimportant to produce milk than meat, it must be recognised that it would take manyyears and a large expenditure on buildings, etc. to effect any substantial switchover from beef to milk production over large areas of the country.   In themeantime the financial resources of tens of thousands of farmers and their creditlargely depend on the value of their cattle and the prices they can get for them.In peace time the great majority of farmers in this country arepredominantly concerned with the production of livestock (including livestock products such as milk) and when for war purposes we have to call upon them toincrease and intensify production from the soil by more intensive arable farming and by ploughing up grassland - a process which requires an outlay of manymillion pounds - there are only two ways in which the necessary finance can beprovided;   Either we must fix remunerative prices both for livestock and for the crops that the farmer sells and so give him increased cash resources and improvehis credits or we must lend him the money to finance the increased production.The second alternative is to be deprecated because it will leave faimers with aload of debt which they will not be able to repay if prices fall after the war.Increased food production has hitherto been financed on the basis of renumerative prices, actual in the case of livestock and promised in the case of crops.   These prices have given the farmers extra cash and extra credit.   Thereis still some hesitation among farmers to expand their commitments and production for fear of a collapse of prices at the end of the war, but the prices announced on June 29th, did create a considerable amount of confidence among both farmers and bankers as to the immediate future i.e. for the next twelve months.To reduce cattle prices as is proposed will not only mean that the farmers who have been fattening cattle this summer will get a reduced cash return.It will also mean a shock to confidence.   It is no consolation or help to farmerswho produce meat and who cannot produce milk to tell them that milk producers are going to get better prices.   The result must be a weakening of the cash and creditposition of farmers over large areas of the country.   The proposed reduction willbe the more serious in its effect because it involves a particularly sharp dropthis autumn Just when the grass season ends and farmers have to sell their stockin large numbers.In my view the policy of reducing cattle prices is misconceived.   It is largely based on the idea that if we are to encourage milk production we mustdiscourage beef production.   This view is I think mistaken.   There is no evidenceof a switch from milk to beef production.   In feet the Agriculture Returnscollected in June indicate that dairy cattle have increased in number since 1939.Some measure of price discrimination is needed to modify peace timeagricultural production to meet the particular food requirements of the nationunder war conditions.   If, however, it is carried to a point where it means pricediscouragement of staple products which form a vital element in the economic stability of large numbers of farmers over large areas of the country, the resultwill be a decline in the ability of those farmers to farm their land properly anda consequent diminution in the total amount of food produced.
