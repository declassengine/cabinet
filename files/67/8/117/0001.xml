HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).S Er C. R E T,W.P,(G)(40)317, COPY NO,  H f29TH NOVEMBER. 1940iWAR CABINETV &apos;AIR RAID DAMAGE;    .MQBILE LABOUR RESERVES,Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.It As desired by the War Cabinet (W.M.(40)297thConclusions, Minute 3) I have held a further conference with the Ministers concerned, and submit the following report of the arrangements made or proposed for securing that an adequate supply of skilled labour, with thenecessary supervisory staff, will be readily available-to make good air-raid damage in areas which have sufferedspecially heavy attackt2. The problem of air-raid damage should beconsidered under two heads.     First, the repairs to beundertaken to meet the first shock of emergency - i.e.repairs necessary to enable &apos; roduction to be re-started,and to restore the elementary necessities of civilianlife.     Under this head falls the restoration of publicutility services, into which I was asked particularly to enquire.      Secondly, repairs to houses and clearance of debris.      These operations continue over a longer period,and as a rule are less urgent   - though in certainexceptional cases (of which examples are given., in paragraph15 below) there may be special reasons for treatingthem as more urgent and giving them more than the usualpriority.3. I will deal first with the problem of securingsuch repair of public utility services as is necessaryto meet the first shock of the emergency,WATER.4e Each Regional Commissioner has the assistance ofat least two Engineering Inspectors of the Ministry ofHealth who have special experience of water supplyproblems and a wide knowledge of all the water undertakings within the Region.     When an undertakingsuffers heavy damage and the repairs are beyond its own resources, the Inspectors are in a position to arrangefor assistance (whether skilled labour, supervisorystaff, or both) to be given by other undertakings withinthe Region;    and, if it is necessary to invoke assistancefrom outside the Region, they can obtain it throughthe Regional Commissioners&apos;  organisation.

5-. These Engineering Inspectors must remain responsible for keeping a general oversight over thecondition of water undertakings throughout the Region;and they could not therefore be relied upon to giveundivided attention to repairs in one area, if therewere other localities in the same Region which had suffered severe damage at the same time.     It is recognised, however,  that it might be necessary,when exceptionally heavy damage had occurred, to bring in .an expert from outside either to assist the WaterEngineer of the undertaking concerned or, in an extreme case, actually to take his place if he had been injuredor was for any reason incapable of the tasks confrontinghim in an acute emergency.     To meet this need,  theMinister of Health is forming a Panel of ConsultantWater Engineers who could be sent to any part of thecountry in such an emergency.6. As regard skilled labour, mutual aid arrangements are already in force (as indicated in   paragraph above) by which a water undertaking needing additionalskilled labour for urgent repair work can obtain it from other undertakings within the Region, and, if need be, from undertakings in neighbouring Regions.It is now proposed to supplement this reserve of skilled labour by earmarking men now engaged in industry,especially those who have some technical knowledge ofthe kind of repair work required by public utility undertakings and could, in an acute emergency, be withdrawnfrom their work in the factories to assist in emergencyrepairs to the public utility services.      In someRegions, arrangements have already been made for menfrom the factories to reinforce the Civil defence services of the local authority in the event ofexceptionally heavy air attack;    and it is proposed thatanalagous arrangements should now be developed in all parts of the country which will enable the publicutility undertakings to borrow from industry, during thebrief period of acute emergency when industrial production has been brought to a standstill, skilled men who could help to restore the public utility services to the point at which industrial production could berestarted.     As soon as this point had been reached,  themen withdrawn from industry would return to their workin the factories.      The Departments concerned are proceeding at once to work out detailed arrangementsby which men in industry who could give   such assistance will be specially earmarked, in consultation with their employers and the public utility undertakings,  so thatthey could be called out through the Regional Commissioners&apos;organisation for service in an acute emergency,7. The arrangements described in paragraphs 4 to 6have been made by the Ministry of Health in respect ofEngland and Wales.      In Scotland, where the Departmentof Health for Scotland is the central authority, avery complete organisation similar in character butdiffering Somewhat in detail has been established tosecure the effective pooling of resources, including a high degree of mobility of labour, for repair of damage to water supplies.

8. Where the available resources of civilian labour are insufficient, the military can he called upon to lend their assistance in an emergency:    and instructions have been given  go all concerned throughout the countryregarding the manner in which military assistance isto be invoked on. these occasions.    The Army can provide,through the Construction Companies of the royal engineers, numbers of skilled men competent to assist in the restoration of public utility services.     Theyhave already given valuable help on various occasions,and a regular- procedure has now been established   forsecuring this type of help from the Army whenever it is needed to supplement civilian resources.GAS.9. Arrangements for assisting gas undertakings are less well advanced, but are being developed on similar lines.The President of the Board of Trade is appointingforthwith expert gas engineers to act as advisers to the Regional Commissioners.      It will be their first duty to review the arrangements for mutual aid betweengas undertakings in their Region and to put these arrangements on a regular and organised basis.     Ascheme for inter-Regional assistance will be preparedby the Board of Trade, in conjunction with the NationalGas Council,10.       As regards supervisory staff, each of theseadvisers will be given a list of the professional gasengineers within his Region whose services could bemade available to any undertaking in need of such assistance^11.       As regards skilled labour,  arrangements havealready been made for the release from the Army of skilled men (mainlayers,  jointers and gangers) previouslyemployed by certain gas undertakings (e.g. London and birmingham) which have suffered severe damage in air-raids.The National Gas Council have now been asked to obtain -at once from all the larger undertakings (numbering about100) particulars of the numbers of such skilled menlost to H.M. Forces and the numbers who would be immediately re-absorbed by the undertaking if released from combatant service.     As soon as these particularsare received, arrangements will be made to secure thereturn to civilian employment of all who would bere-absorbed at once;    and, if it is found that there is any considerable number who would not be immediatelyre-absorbed by their previous employers, consideration will at   once be given to the question how their services could be made most readily available in the areas wherethe need is greatest.12.       The Departments concerned are also consideringthe application to gas undertakings of the proposals,outlined in paragraph 6 above, for the earmarking ofmen in industry who could supplement the skilled labour available for the restoration of public utility services in an acute emergency.

15;        The arrangements for military assistance, described in paragraph b above, apply to gas undertakings as toother public utility services, and are workingsatisfactorily.ELECTRICITY.14.        The organisation of electricity supplies underthe Electricity Commissioners and the central electricity 3oard ensures that an adequate supply oflabour and materials is available for any urgent repairsrequired as a result of enemy action.     The measures taken to provide reserves of materials and to ensurethe necessary labour force have proved   fully adequate to secure the continuity of electricity supply in all parts of the country,EMERGENCY REPAIRS TO HOUSES.15.       Emergency repair of houses damaged by air attackis ordinarily a duty of the local authority.      It may,however, be necessary to take special measures to assistlocal authorities - either (a) because, as at Coventry,there wes a shortage of housing accommodation before the damage occurred and it is a matter of urgent national importance;, for production reasons,  to make a number ofthe same houses habitable so that work in vital factoriesmay proceed:    or (b) because, as in London, the numbersof houses damaged constitute a problem beyond the resourcesof the local authorities, and public morale may beshaken if action is not taken by the Government to accelerate the rate of repair.While, therefore, repair of houses is normallyto be regarded as somewhat less urgent than therestoration of public utility services,  there will beoccasion on which it will assume a higher priority inparticular areas and special supplementary measures will then be called fort16.        In London, during October, houses were beingdamaged at the rate of about 40,000 a week, and thetotal force of civilian labour at the disposal of localauthorities was adequate to carry out repairs atthe rate of only about 20,000 a week.      To meet this situation, it was found essential to ask for the releaseof skilled building operatives from the Army;    and, inorder to secure continuous employment for men so released,it was arranged that they should be formed into a central pool., under the control of the Ministry ofWorks and Buildings, which would be used either to supplement labour engaged by the local authorities or to do the work under the control of the ministry in areas where the local authority was unequal to thetask.      It is expected that, within the course of thenext few weeks, something in the neighbourhood of 4,000men will be released from the Army to form this poolunder the control of the Ministry of Works and Buildings.17.       In order to meet the needs of those areas whererepair of houses is a matter of first urgency, it hasbeen agreed that -

(a) The central pool under the control of theMinistry of Works and Buildings shall he held available for use, not only in London,hut in any area throughout the country -questions of   riority being determined by theMinistry of Health.(b) The Ministry of Works and Buildings will atonce consider, in consultation with otherDepartments concerned, what compulsory powers are needed, and what administrative arrangements must be made, to enable them to divert tourgent work on house repairs contractors&apos;gangs engaged on building work on behalf ofGovernment Departments, and to arrange fortheir billeting, feeding and transport.      Itis recognised that the most effective way ofmaking labour rapidly available in any partof the country where it is required is totransfer men already at work on anotherjob, together with their foremen andsupervisory staffs;    and it is consideredthat in special cases (such as occurred atCoventry) contractors engaged on other government work should be required to release a proportion of the;r men and plant,temporarily, to carry out emergency work on house repairs.18.       These arrangements will go some way to meet thosespecial cases where the repair of damaged houses mustbe treated as a matter of special urgency.     The ministers concerned are satisfied, however, that exceptionally heavy attcks on limited targets will produce a situationwhich (as happened at Coventry) calls for more labourthan can be provided from civilian resources;     The .military authorities, while anxious to give: all theasistance they can and ready to help    in meeting thefirst shock of the emergency   would, we understand,be disposed to regard the- repair of houses as notfalling within the emergency measures for which their assistance may be invoked, and in any event doubt whether it is possible for them, out of their existing resources, to spare men for the long periods requiredto undertake this type of work.      It is, however, ourconsidered view that if an adequate supply of labour is to be made available for this work in the areas where it may from time to time be needed, a further contribution will have to be made by the Army, in two ways: -(a) The Ministry of Labour is satisfied that thereis no reserve of skilled building labouramong the civilian population.    If, therefore,the central pool under the control of theMinistry   of Works and Buildings is to be expanded beyond the figure of 4,000 so ferproposed to enable it to give substantial assistance to heavily damaged areaswherever they may be.j it will be necessary(unless we can reduce substantially thepresent building programme) that large numbers

of skilled building operatives now-serving in the Army otherwise than in theirown trades shall be released to join thiscentral pool for continuous employment on house-repair work.(b) Where,  as at Coventry, special conditions makeit a matter of first urgency that damagedhouses should be repaired without delay,we think that this work should be regardedas among the emergency measures for whichmilitary assistance may properly be invokedas a temporary measure;    and we consider thatin such cases military assistance should begiven on the same basis as for otheremergency repair&apos;work.     We have not had anopportunity of consulting the militaryauthorities;    and we recognise that, apartfrom all other considerations, there may be practical difficulties in providing military personnel having the particular type of skillrequired for some parts of this buildingrepair work,     &quot;We are, however, of opinionthat much of the preliminary &quot;first-aid&quot; workon house repairs could readily be carried outby Pioneers, and very valuable assistance could be given if the military authorities could see their way to allow the Pioneers tohelp with this work while considering at thesame time whether other military personnelcould be provided to carry out the moreskilled parts of the work.If the military authorities are ofopinion that they cannot undertake this additional commitment from their existing resources, we recommend that immediate consideration snould be given to thepossibility of increasing the existingestablishments of the Auxiliary MilitaryPioneer Corps and the Construction companies to a point which would enable the Army toassist the civil authorities with this typeof work in the specially critical situationsto which we have referred.In making this recommendation we havealso in mind the very valuable assistance which the Army are giving in the clearance uxdebris from damaged sites.      Although this isnot within our terms of reference, we are aware of the demands which are likely to bemade on the Army for further assistance on this work in areas where specially heavy damage has beensustained and the civilian labour available is inadequate to deal with the situation;    andwe think it important from the point of viewof maintaining public morale- that theestablishment of the A.M.P.C.  should besufficient to enable the military authoritiesto meet those demands without prejudice to theneeds of troops undergoing training.

CONCLUSION.-19,       So far as concerns the restoration of publicutility services, we think that the arrangementsalready made, and the supplementary measures which(as    explained in this Report) the responsible civil authorities are now taking, will together afford themost practical means of ensuring a sufficient mobility of labour resources to deal with air-raid &quot;damagewherever it occurs.     And for this work military assistance is available to supplement civilian resources in an emergency.The arrangements for the repair of damaged houses are* in our&apos; view, more precarious - because of the greatshortage of skilled building labour and because themilitary authorities have not so far felt able toundertake to give any extensive assistance in this field.     Coventry has showh* however, how vital the repair of houses may be to the maintenance of theessential production on which our war-effort depends.After a heavy attack on an industrial town a proportionof the houses may have to be made habitable at once in order that the workers may resume work in the factories.     In these cases the repair of housesought, we think, to be included among those emergency measures for which military assistance may be invoked;and the military authorities should, in our view, beauthorised to put themselves in a position to give assistance in these circumstances in such strengthand for such periods as are necessary to enableindustrial production to be resumed.(Intd.)
