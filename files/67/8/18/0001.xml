grra rjQGUMPW IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERMMBWI.COPY NO.V (ft)fr.Ol 218MISUST 1940. 2.WAR     CABINET.POSITION OP COASTING AND SHORT SEA LINERS.MEMORANDUM BY THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, MINISTRY OF SHIPPING.In the absence of the Minister I submit the following :-The cessation of continental trade and of trade with France, andthe restrictions on any regular traffic through the English Channel,have greatly curtailed the avenues of employment for tonnage of theliner type ordinarily engaged in the coastal and short sea trades.    these ships are not suitable for distant voyages, and the closing of theMediterranean and the French Moroccan ports has further restricted themeans of employing them.The situation of British owners is aggravated by the number of swedish and Norwegian vessels chartered for the French coal trade, manyof which are not fit for ocean voyages.     Some Danish vessels of asimilar class are prizes and a number of small Dutch coasters were alsoobtained.     Apart from our agreements, it would obviously be contrary to policy to throw tonnage back upon the Norwegian or Dutch Shipping Missionsor the friendly Swedish shipowners or seek to prevent its use.     We cannot afford to let discontent arise among the large number of allied and neutral seamen - Norwegians, Dutch, Danes and Swedes - whose services we now secure by offering them continued employment, nor take the risk ofany of this tonnage escaping from our control.     If this be admitted, wecannot escape the financial burden of paying for these ships, even by not using them.     Moreover, in emergency, we may need all this tonnage.While the volume of small tonnage has thus been augmented and theroutes upon which it can ply have been practically restricted to our owncoast, the traffic offering for carriage coastwise by vessels of the Linertype is itself restricted as a result of the competition of other formsof transport.The rise in costs of operation has necessitated successive increases in the rates of freight by coasting liners, which are now above thepre-war level.     This percentage was fixed at a time when war riskinsurance rates stood at 2fo for SI days.     The rate of premium has since been increased to kfi and owners find it difficult to meet expenses andearn any return upon their capital.     The increase in railway rates, whichin many cases were already cut to meet water and road competition in thepast, has, on the other hand, been limited under Government direction to10 j over all, with the result that more and more traffic is being diverted from sea to rail.     in their desire to obtain the cheapest transport for themselves, Government departments, like private traders, have, as Iunderstand, negotiated and are still negotiating special freight agreements with the railway companies, under- which the greater the trafficguaranteed to the railway the lower does the rate tend to be.Other considerations besides cost, no doubt, are taken into account by the departments, including a proper anxiety not to risk cargounnecessarily at sea.     It may be unwise to risk munitions or othershipments of vital importance or exceptionally high value by a second seavoyage, but we should not abandon the use of coastal routes and throw thewhole strain of distribution upon our roads and railways.:    ^6 ^&quot;^?ility of the railways to damage must be considerable and inthe event of the closing or drastic interruption of some of our mapsjrts,
perhaps for prolonged periods, as a result of invasion or repeated&quot;bombardments from the air, the strain thrown upon them might wellbe more than they could meet.     It is, therefore, essential tokeep our small liner tonnage - so useful an instrument for thedistribution of general merchandise from one large port toanother or to the smaller ports round the coast - fully mobile and ready for immediate use in any emergency.    The emergency schemeof diversion has &quot;been devised on the basis that an ample supply ofcoastwise vessels will always be available.The Chamber of Shipping have represented to me strongly thatthis stage of preparedness cannot be counted upon if owners are left without full and regular employment at reasonably remunerativerates.     They will feel compelled to lay up many of their ships and their crews will drift into other service.Various remedies have been suggested -(a) After the last war, when the railways were congested,and there was maladjustment between the level of railway and coasting rates, a scheme of subsidy was introduced,applicable both to export and import traffic, under whichmerchants were required to offer named traffic forcoastwise shipment and permission to forward by rail wasonly given if coastwise facilities were not available.Y/hen the goods were shipped coastwise, the Government paid the difference between the coastwise and the lower rail rate.(b) Short of such a subsidy, it should be possible to transfer to coastwise liner shipping a sufficient volume of cargoowned or controlled by the Ministry of Pood and the Ministryof Supply to keep the vessels fully and regularly employed,although this would mean payment by those departments or their various controls of freights substantially in excessof present railway rates.     This would not be a completeremedy for the difficulties of the coastwise owners withoutfurther increases in coastwise freights.(c) The Government could relieve owners of the cost of insurance against war risk, but this I should be reluctant to recommendso long as the vessels remain free from requisition.     Underrequisition, the Government would assume the liability.(d) There remains the solution of requisitioning the Coastwiseand Short Sea Liners.     This course has not hitherto been necessary.     A system of licensing and controlling freightshas been administratively preferable to full requisitionin the case of a type of tonnage which is constantly in and out of port.     Efficient management and avoidance of delaysare best secured in such circumstances under the watchfuleye of the owner.     If the vessels are taken on time charterby the Government, and hire is paid whether they are used ornot, and whether they are turned round quickly or slowlyin port, it may be difficult to ensure the same results by central control.     The number of vessels affected is between200 and 250.2iy conclusions are :-(1) Coastwise Liner shipping and many of the Short Sea Liners alsoare losing their opportunities of remunerative employment through the cessation of continental and French trades which were open till two orthree months ago, through the restrictions upon coastwise trade, and through the competition of low railway rates,(2) Our system of internal distribution will be overstrained inthe event of substantial diversions of traffic from the ports to whichit is ordinarily consigned.
(3) We cannot afford to see the small Liners laid up and their creTirsdispersed, as is likely to happen in more or less degree if no special steps are taken.(4) Allocation by the supply departments of suitable traffic inadequate volume to employ such vessels is an essential part of any soundsolution.(3) If therefore, effect is given to this principle forthwith, Ipropose to bring the coasting and short sea liners under full requisitionupon suitable terms.I should have been disposed to try the effect of such an allocationbefore proceeding to general requisition, but for recent developments.In present conditions, however, I am satisfied that requisition is unavoidable in order to ensure that all the vessels are kept in commissionand to give me complete control of them, so that vessels can be interchangedand allotted at short notice to whatever service is required, and further to deal equally with one owner and another.Those Lines which trade mainly on the West Coast or to Ireland areexperiencing much less difficulty than others and these branches of thetrande may continue to be remunerative.     Any policy of requisition mustthus embrace the whole tonnage, and so secure equality of treatment between one owner and another.(6) My proposals in paragraphs (4) and (5) are accepted by theMinisters of Supply and Transport and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.A. S.Ministry of Shipping,16th August, 1940.
