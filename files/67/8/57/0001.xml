three years from an output figure of  3g million a yearto  10 million a year in 1.943 with -a post-war output of 8 million a year,,    The scheme envisaged the acquisition&quot;by I.C.I, of steel and ether building materials necessaryfor the extension of their dyestuffs works and plant,and also of raw materials necessary for the productionof the quantity of dyestuffs and particularly thespecial ranges of dyestuffs required to replace Germandyestuffs or dyestuffs from German controlled sourceswhich no longer were freely available to the UnitedKingdom market and the export markets.,10. The Committee referred to the Board of Tradeand the Ministry of Supply, in consultation with I.C.I.the question of the allocation of the steel and other materials required for the proposed development programme.The approval of the Works and Building Priority Committee hasbeen obtained to the issue of the structural materialsrequired by I,CJC  subject to compliance with conditionsdirected to ensuring economy in the use of materials and control over labour, and the materials necessary forthe first stage of the work have been authorised.Similarly steel for plant and appliances has been authorised&quot;and the necessary priority granted,11* In addition LCJo are in direct touch with theMinistry of Supply in connection with the raw material required for the production envisaged in their development programme,.12. The question whether the dyestuffs requirementsof the United Kingdom and Indian textile industries canbe met without recourse to German supplies or sourcescontrolled by Germany during the Interim period until the dyestuffs development scheme could come into full effect&quot;fas referred for consideration to the Board of Trade,Ministry of Economic Warfare, India Office and Foreign Office,I.C.I. explained, however, that they were now satisfied thatthey did not need to import German dyes (which had in factnot been imported into the United Kingdom or Indiasince the outbreak of War).,     As regards the United Kingdomthere remained only the question of the supply of Swissdyes made by a German controlled company, and containingmore than 25 per cent* German material.    In July, however,H.M. Minister in Berne reported that the German interestshad been eliminated, and since then the few consignmentsreleased for shipment to this country have been certified by H.M. Consul to be of less than 25 per cent. Germancontent.    In these circumstances the question of tradeprohibited under the existing provisions of the Trading withthe Enemy Act no longer arises.      As regards India, it isunderstood that, subject to the I0C.I. expansion programmebeing fulfilled, she should be able to dispense with german or suspect dyes,13. To sum up -(a) 1.0.1. have acquired the selling organisationof I.G, in India.

(b) The I.C.I. Dye stuffs Development jero gramme hasmade a start and, subject to unforeseen difficulties,as to materials, should proceed according to plan.(c) The question of importing dyestuffs which require - licences under the Trading with the EnemyAct is in existing circumstances dormant.(int.id,)   HnRi richmond Terrace, S 0 V/ 01,8th October,  1940o
