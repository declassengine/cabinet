Extract.&apos; 1.      HOME FOOD PRODUCTION.&apos;.   (Previous References    F, po.(to)(40) 35th Mtg. Conclusion 4).The Coiaiiiittee had &quot;before them a Memorandum by theMinister of -aircraft Production (W, P. (G)(40) 233) and a joint memorandum by the Minister of -agriculture and Fisheries,  theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State forthe Home Department (P. P, (M)(40) 165)..:In discussion, on these papers the following points were made;-(i) The view of  &quot;he Minister of Agriculture was thatbroadly speaking, if an increase in food production was desired;  i&quot;c would be better to look mainly to the -more .efficient farms-s who, though in a minority, farmed by. far the larger   art of our landn      With the possible exception of pi^ prices, the prices now fixed were regarded by farmers as not unsatisfactory over, a short period, -and if a guarantee could be given that existingprices would be maintained, this would give them an assurance that they v.cv.ld recover the expenditure whichthey must incus:&apos; on inci-eased production,-     Both the Ministerand the Secretary of State for Scotland agreed that such aguarantee should be extended for the duration of the warand for at least one year afterwards.       The Home Office,on the other hand, while agreeing generally with theMinister of Agriculture, considered that farmers inNorthern Ireland would get greater encouragement from adefinite but general statement that the Government -attached importance to the maintenance of agriculture afterthe war on a sound, and healthy basis,      A guarantee of thekind proposed might lead them to fear that there would bea sudden heavy fall in prices when the guarantee expired.(ii) So far as the less efficient farmers were concerned.,,the proposal of the Agricultural Ministers was that county agricultural Executive Committees should either issue instructions to them as to the manner in which their land should be farmed, or should take over their farmsfrom them      This procedure would involve some expenditureof public money, not all of which would be recoverable,but the amount involved was not likely to be considerable.i   (iii)   a survey carried out during the summer showed that much grassland would not be worth ploughing up unlesssupplies of phosphatic fertilisers could be increased.The amount required was a matter for expert consideration,but in addition to importing sufficient raw material tokeep the manufacturing capacity in this country (amountingto 700,000 tons a year) fully employed, it would benecessary to import super--phosphates from the United States,provided that purchase of supplies, all of which were heldby the United States Government, could be arranged.      unless these imports arrived before next Spring, they could not affect food production until September 1942-      Some formof supervision should be exercised through the county agricultural Executive Committees to ensure that suppliesof fertilisers were used to the best advantage.     In orderto secure increased imports of fertilisers,  the Minister ofAgriculture would be prepared, if necessary, to accept,though reluctantly, a reduction in imports of feeding stuffs.
(iv)       It would also be desirable, though not essential, toincrease the number of tractors available and of other formsof agricultural machinery,        a slight increase in the labour supply would also be needed.-(v)        In general; the present agricultural prices were regarded asreasonably satisfactory by Scottish farmers.      In the case of oatssome adjustment (such as the replacement of a standard   price byminimum price) was desired except in the case of marginal andhighland ground giving low yields.        Special consideration&quot;snouuu be given to the position of hill sheep farmers, e. g. a subsidy to cast ewes.      finally, if an addition to the cultivableland was to be made, an intensive and sustained attack would benecessary upon pestss  such as rabbits and bracken.(vi)       The Ministry of Shipping saw no prospect of fulfillingthe import programmes for the Ministry of Food and the Ministryof Supply for the current year.     Losses from sinkings in recent weeks were equivalent to 6^ of imports;    the figure of 14 amentioned in the second paragraph of the Memorandum by theMinister of Aircraft Production referred to combined losses from sinkings and air raids.      If imports of fertilisers wereto be increased; this could only be at the expense of otherimports.      If an equivalent reduction was to be made in theMinistry of Food programme-, every additional ton of fertiliserswould&quot; mean the loss of more than, say, one ton of wheat in viewof the longer hauls involved-,      The Minister of Food would nodoubt consider whether he would prefer to sacrifice imports offood in the immediate future in order to secure increased foodproduction in succeeding yearse(vii)       In the view of the Minister of Food, it would be desirableto increase our imports of fertilisers as an insurance for thefuture.      He also cordially supported the proposal for maintaining a guaranteed price to farmers until at least one year after theend of the war.      The guaranteed market for agricultural productsprovided by his Department should also be similarly maintained.Farming costs had already been to a large extent stabilised;with stable prices and a guaranteed market farmers should &quot;be willing to make every effort to increase production.      It was essential, however,  that the additional foodstuffs producedshould be those specially required to meet the needs of the.nation.      Some definite machinery of control was indispensable to ensure this.      This view was fully accepted by theAgricultural Ministers.(viii)       The Minister of Food did not agree, however, that additional imports of fertilisers must result in a reduction ofthe Ministry of Food import programmer      It might, for example,be possible to increase importing capacity by securing a more rapid turn round of ships.      To keep the people well fed was essential to the maintenance of morale.(ix)       The Committee were informed that the Chancellor of theExchequer would express his views on these proposals when thematter was considered by the War Cabinet.      It was worth notingthat a general statement on the position of agriculture afterthe war had already been made by a previous Minister of AgricultuiThe proposal to guarantee the price of agricultural products mightwell raise similar claims from other industries.      The position ofthe Dominions as agricultural producers must also be borne in mind-
(x) The Board of Trade would feel some concern at theproposal to maintain guaranteed prices unless this was tohe done at the cost of the Treasury.      If food prices in this country were to he maintained after the war at a level far above that of world prices, this would have aserious effect upon our competitive position in world markets.      It was important also to define clearly the period for which the guarantee was to be given.The Committee agreed as follows:-(a) In view of the unfavourable developments inthe shipping situation,, it was desirablethat home food production in 1941 shouldbe increased beyond the programme of expansiondecided upon in August last by the War Cabinet(W. Mo (40) 237th Conclusions, Minute l).Definite control should be exercised in orderto ensure that this increase in production should not be general; but should be such as would increase supplies of foodstuffs speciallyrequired by the nation,(b) In order to secure increased production,  farmers should be- given how a guaranteed price and a guaranteed market for a period covering the duration of the war and at least one yearthereafter-.      The terms of this guaranteewould require careful formulation.      It wouldalso be necessary to consider as a matter ofgeneral social policy how far the cost ofguaranteeing prices should be met by theTreasuryf cr passed on to the consumer.(e) It would be desirable immediately to increaseimports of phosphatic fertilisers,  includingsuper-phosphates to be purchased;  if practicable,from the United States Government.      Supervisionshould be exercised to ensure that supplies of fertilisers were used to the best advantage.It was noted that,  in the view of the Ministryof Shipoing, additional imports of fertiliserscould be secured only by a reduction in other?items under the import programmes of theMinistry of Pood or the Ministry of Supply.(d) Other measures would be required on the lines set out in paragraph 6 of the Joint Memorandumby the Agricultural Ministers (F. P. (M)(40) 165).In Scotland the steps to be taken should include a sustained and intensive campaign againstrabbits and bracken,(e) It was noted that the questions referred toabove were to be submitted to the War cabinet for final decision;  and that in the meantime the Chancellor of the Exchequer reserved hisposition,.
