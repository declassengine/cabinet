secret.P. (G) (40) 2536th October, 1940TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken to ensuresecrecy of this document.WAR CABINETESTABLISHMENT AND PAY OF POLISH LAND forces memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARThe War Cabinet have had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, W.P. (G) (40) 247, dealing with the question^ ofthe rates of pay for the allied forces, and proposing certain modifications inthe present practice. That practice is based on the principle that the allied,forces receive &quot; basic British rates with some adjustments as regards rates of pay for Naval and Air Force personnel to meet the special conditions which apply in those two services&quot;. By basic British rates is understood broadly speaking the initial rate for each rank without addition for length of service,proficiency and for performing particular duties. The memorandum statedthat the application of this principle has caused some difficulty with the Frenchand Polish authorities from whom claims were made for appropriate rates of pay for skilled personnel corresponding to those paid in our own forces, andthat the Allied Forces (Official) Sub-Committee had put before Ministers fouralternative solutions of the difficulties which were arising. I, with the other ministers concerned, expressed my willingness to agree to the following of thefour solutions&apos; proposed:  That, departing from the existing principle referred to above, the Admiralty,War Office and Air Ministry should be authorized to make the best arrange-.ments they can within the limits of their full pay code with each of the allied forces concerned subject to the following provisos:  (a) That service in an Allied Force, prior to the 1st July, 1940, shouldnot count for any increment of pay.(6) That a check on the number of Allied personnel in receipt of higher rates of pay should be enforced by refusing to pay for a greater number of skilled and specially qualified personnel per unit than are provided for in the establishment of a comparable British unit.Exceptions to this rule could be made, where the GovernmentDepartment concerned thought it necessary.I still think that this is the desirable solution, but in view of discussions that I have had with General Sikorski and his representatives I desire theWar Cabinet to have before them more explicitly and in greater detail whatthe effect will be of the second proviso referred to above. Although thatproviso is somewhat narrow in its phraseology, and refers in terms only to&quot; skilled and specially qualified personnelthe intention underlying, therecommendation is that, if the foreign contingents are to enjoy in a large measure the benefits of the full pay code, their establishments should conformgenerally to the British establishments, that is to say they should not have a disproportionate number of higher officer ranks, N.C.Os. and skilled personnelcompared with the British Forces. It would obviously be unfair not only tothe British taxpayer but also to British officers and other ranks if a foreignunit of comparable size contained a larger proportion of higher ranks. Nor,seeing that under the British war code a British officer or N.C.O. retains hisCopy No. 5 printed for the War Cabinet, October, 1940
The&apos;War Office,6th October, 1940(B40/8)   100   10/40   W.O.P.   6357-acting rank only while there are.duties appropriate to that rank to perform,would it be easy to justify maintaining a large number of foreign officers and in.C.Os. not required from a military point of view and holding ranks whichthe actual duties, if any, do not necessitate. .But the application jof these principles to the Polish Army gives rise to considerable difficulty. i hey have in this country some 4,200 officers. they themselves admit that.some 900 or 1,000 are surplus to their requirements andare willing, i understand, to demobilize them provided that acceptable provision is made for their maintenance. But the balance of over 3,200 they desire toretain and pay in their present ranks and they have so framed their proposedestablishments as to absorb these numbers: by British standards, taking a generous view, less than 1,400 should be necessary. Under the Allied Forces(Official) Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendations, the surplus of over 1,800 officers should either be demobilized or should relinquish their commissions and be absorbed in the ranks. General&apos;Sikorski is pressing for their retention, if on no other ground, then, because they should be regarded as a cadre for the Polishpost-war Army.The Cabinet may desire to know how this problem has been dealt with inthe French and Czech forces. So far as General de gaulle&apos;s forces in thiscountry are concerned his establishments are not excessive, judged by british standards. So far as concerns adherents joining General de Gaulle in theMiddle East, it was decided on the recommendation of the Committee onForeign (Allied) Resistance that all volunteers should be accepted in their ranks,but that their numbers should be watched in case an undue surplus threatened.So far as the Czechs are concerned their establishments have been framed on british lines, and their surplus officers are resigning their commissions to serve in a special unit. That is a precedent which I had hoped the Poles might follow,but I understand that there is no likelihood of this. General Sikorski has, infact, made it plain to me in most emphatic terms that it is politically impossiblefor him to do as the Czechs have done.If,, in fact, there is going to be a considerable number of surplus officers whoare not to be retained with the Polish Army, it is clear that, the question arisesas to the terms under which they are to be dealt with. On the recommendationof the Allied Forces (Official) Sub-Committee it was proposed.to.allow to such officers a flat rate of service retired pay of  135 a year if they had not less than15 years full-time service as an officer in their own forces. For soldiers with21 years service it was proposed to allow 14s. a week for privates, with higher rates for sergeants and above with appropriate service in the rank. For officersand other ranks who are not eligible for retired pay or pension it was proposedthat the Assistance Board should make provision under the scheme for PublicRelief of Distress. It is unlikely that these proposals will be regarded as satisfac-tory by the Polish authorities, and they are at the moment being examined tosee whether in some cases more generous treatment could be given having regardto the rules that govern the grant of retired pay and pension to Service personnel.I desire to give the War Cabinet this opportunity of confirming or reviewing the decision which was recommended to them in the paper tq which I have referred, and to which they gave their tacit assent.For my part, I remain of the view that it is on balance the fair decision,but I do not wish to belittle the political and other difficulties inherent in it forGeneral Sikorski.Since writing this memorandum I have received a letter from GeneralSikorski of which I attach a copy.A.

COM!iANDER-in-CHIEF OF THE FOLISIi ARMYLONDON 5th  OCTOBER,1940,My dear Minister,On signing the agreement with the British GovernmentI ?/as convinced that the material situation of our troops willhe in all respects similar to that of H.M.Forces.     Neitherdid I conceive any doubts that our officers who will be used in special officers&apos; units will not be treated on the same footing with-regards to their pay as &apos; their   colleagues holdingofficers&apos; commissions.     I was all the more convinced of theabove in view of the fact that this matter was satisfactorilysettled in France, and the personnel of the &quot;Officers&apos; Legion&quot;,which was being formed there received the same pay as officersholding establishments in other units0We have a considerable surplus of officers.     This isthe obvious result of our having in France an Army of 100,000men.     This Army had to be suitably officered and thus, all our effort was directed on to the thorough preparation of suitableofficers&apos; cadres0.    We therefore endeavoured to evacuatevaluable officers1 material from occupied Poland and neutral countries, mainly Roumania and Hungary.The Polish Army organized in France was a loyal Allyto the comraon causeo     Consequently not only heavy losses wereinflicted to our units but our troops fighting to the lastcould not be evacuated from France to this Country.      This wasthe reason why the number, of officers and N. C 0 0&apos; s. becamedisproportionate to that of; the file,,The present position with regard to the personnel,tiumgh at the present moment may seem abnormal, can prove inthe. nearest future to be extremely opportune and useful.Our Forces in this Country are organized as cadresand are capable of absorbing at any moment a tenfold numberof soldiers.     This acquires special importance in view ofthe fact that the present defensive attitude of Great Britainand her Allies, necessitated by circumstances, will have to alter in the future.At that moment the existence of fully trained,organized and numerous officers&apos; cadres will become particularly important.     Their transfer to the Home Country for the purposeof organizing armed action in a central sector of the continentwill be     decisive value.     Furthermore the question oforganizing Polish units in Canada becomes topical and isprogressing satisfactoriljr.Should I exclude the surplus officers from the Army,I could be rightly accused of shortsighted policy, for it would endanger the future of Poland and would be against our common interests.     I have contracted tremendous responsibility towardsmy Country, and our Agreement providing for the formation of anArmy of a Sovereign State, allows me to settle this problem tothe best of these interests.Hon.Anthony Eden, M,C0 , M.secretary of State for War,The War Office0/ Further,
Further, a number of surplus officers Is necessary!for the carrying out of certain work connected with the needs&apos;of our Country.In view of the above, I cannot agree to the exclusion from the Army of a greater part of our officers.I could only consent to eliminate a few hundred, of elderlymen unsuitable for service in units.     These officers^ forming a separate groups could he paid special.pension which would!enable them, however, a sufficient standard of life.Army bein^be settleclimits of country,grounds.I fully realise that the question of pay for our: now in so very exceptional conditions could notI as 3ret by subordinate Departments within thestandard rules and regulations - in force in this it requires wider bases for settlement on political!The present provisional arrangement, however, see;.to have lasted long enough causing discontent which may affect the morale of the troops,/     In view of this I consider this question as particularly important and urgent,, -This is the reason why I had to approach you onthis matter once more and I would he very grateful if you could kindly give your particular attention to this question and arrange for Its satisfactory settlement, thus creatingnormal conditions of existence for the Polish Forces.Yours very sincerely,(Sgdo)    S.IKORSKI,
