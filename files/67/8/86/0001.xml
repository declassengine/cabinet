WAR CABINET.SUPPLY OP MACHINE TOOLS.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.OUTSTANDING machine tool requirements for the Ministry of aircraft production are in the region of  30 million, representing approximately 26,000machines.  All a.re needed within the next 12 months.2. Of these requirements, orders for delivery during the next six months tothe value of about  9 million have been placed in the United States. Of these machines it is not expected that the United States Administration will releasetools to the value of more than half this amount.3. Of the outstanding French American machines, approximately 3 million may be available to M.A.P.4. The present total yearly output in Great Britain is to the value of 15 million.5. It can be seen that in the present circumstances the Ministry of aircraft production will receive about half of its requirements.6. I ask authority to place forthwith in the United States a further order for machine tools of  10 million value.7. All schemes in this country involving the use of machine tools shouldbe examined and where possible shelved. And all those, including the scheme fortraining centres not already in operation, should be abandoned.B.Ministry of Aircraft Production,November 5, 1940.[21883]JPrinted for the War Cabinet.
