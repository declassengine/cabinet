fTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY &quot;OP HIS BRITANIEEG&quot;ivIAJESTY&apos;S G0V1IRNMENT).SgCEET- . -  COPY NO.October, 1940..T/AR CABINET.GIBRALTAR EVACUEES. &quot;Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies and the Minister of Health.1, As^a result of a Cabinet decision of 19th May, 1940, (W.M. (40) 129th .Conclusions, Minute 9.), there are nov/   in this country some 10,600 civilians       ..compuslorily evacuated from Gibraltar.   It ms clearly understood, &quot;when the decisionms taken that these people should only be accommodated in England temporarily, andthat by the -winter they should-be trans-shipped elsewhere.2, - &quot;- :There are very strong reasons against their retention in London: .-&quot;..the pressure upon available space in London is. increasing as a resultof air raids;the evacuees in.L.ondon will be exposed to. constant and serious risks.froiala&apos;ir? raidsj...&quot;.&apos;. ..    &quot; &apos;  -the conditions &quot;under which the evacuees are acccnflmodate&quot;c  &quot;Were - designed .-.,.. -.-only, to meet a temporary emergency.   They are quite unsuitable for a -stay v sof long duratibni   These people cannot be billeted on private householders, &quot;j&quot;-and it. is impossible to find in the country other suitable accommodation j..from the standpoint of health, medical advisers of the Colonial Office.andof the Ministry of Health, and the Colonial Advisory Medical Committee,have advised that the evacuees should be transferred to approved areas inthe &quot;West Indies -where they mil not be exposed to the rigours of theEnglish climate in winter.   It has been necessary to accommodate the-refugees in large buildings where opportunities&quot; of -crowding,together aremultiplied.   This is in itself a risk, particularly -ds.these people, would possibly be exposed, to a greater risk of respiratory diseases, in thiscountry than in Gibraltar.&apos;  An epidemic disease (e.g.,;jnflu*shz.a) among: -such a oommunity, consisting of a high proportion or the very young and very old, would almost&quot; certainly have the most serious results. &quot;These disadvantages will be largely absent in the West Indies.   In thoseColonies provision for their welfare and happiness can be made far more, satisfactorilyand comprehensively than in London, where - if they remain - a progressive deterioration in their health and   morale seems inevitable.   During the past three...months -arrangements have been in progress for the reception of these people in Jamaica and Trihidad^^BcSsEea;already some  200,000 has been spent in making preparations for housing, etc. onbehalf of H.M. Government.   This plan has not been welcomed by the evacuees,   butthere was no hostility until the disaster to the &quot;City of Benares&quot; and the decision not to proceed with the Children1s Overseas Reception Board Scheme.   The announcementstated that the Government could hot take the responsibility of sending childrenoverseas in present circumstances, and it has had the definite effect of putting thegreat majority of the refugees from Gibraltar in the mood to refuse to sail.St9 Reports which have been received suggest that the evacuees could probablybe persuaded to acquiesce in the re-evacuation plan, if they could be assured of naval protection throughout the voyage for all the ships.   Given reasonable flexibility insailing dates, the Adiniralty see no insuperable difficulty in arranging for theevacuation ships to be escorted through the submarine danger zone, and in our opinion(a)(c)/this
this measure of protection is essential.   But, &quot;beyond this zone, the prospects ofproviding a naval eS:cort are limited to the journey as far as Halifax and even forthis journey are extremely problematical.   These circumstances point to the use ofvessels of the highest possible speed for the evacuees, since the higher the speed of the vessels used, the greater is their potential security after they have left     ^the submarine danger zone.   On the other hand a limited assurance of protection for gart of the journey only is unlikely to assuage the not unreasonable apprehensions of the evacuees, vihatever the speed of the ship employed,5* The question of applying compulsion for their re-evacuation thereforearises.   This raises various issues, namely,compulsion can only be applied if in the last resort recourse ishad to force.it is a strong measure to compel the evacuees to proceed across the atlantic, when as recently as the 3rd October the Government issuedan official statement that they could not assume the responsibilityfor sending English-children overseas.the expulsion of 10^000 British subjects from this country where arefuge has been provided at the public expense for many thousands offoreign refugees, many of ififoom are of enemy nationality, is open toobvious criticism.the effect of compulsion on the male relatives in Gibraltar, and through them on the security of the fortress, is also an important consideration,we are advised that the expulsion of British subjects from the country could not be effected under a Defence Regulation.   An Act of parliament would be necessary.jn! addition there is the real risk of a ship with these refugees being sunk, and livesbeing lost.6. We are in fact, literally, between the devil and the deep blue sea. &apos; Ifthe Gibraltarians (compulsorily evacuated from Gibraltar) stay here, they may sufferheavily from bombing or winter illnesses j but if they are now compelled to undertake the voyage to safety in the West Indies, they may be drowned Qn the way. Paced withthis choice we feel on balance unable, in view of the peoples&apos; own mood and of the &apos;considerations set out in the preceding paragraph, to recommend recourse to compulsoryre-evacuation.7. But it is for consideration whether, especially in view of the decisionon the Children&apos;s Overseas Reception Board scheme, an endeavour could properly  bemade&apos; to persuade   as many as possible of the evacuees to go voluntarily to theWest Indies.   On the whole we think it could.   We understand that some 500 persons arenow prepared to go overseas voluntarily, and this number may grow.   This would atleast relieve the congestion and the dangers in London, and we should avoid forcingthe evacuees to run the risks on the Atlantic,   In view of the seriousness of theissue involved, however, we seek the views of the War Cabinet.L*M.M.(a)(a)(e)24-th Ootober. 1940
