I agree thatthis would be: an entirely appropriate method of public-ation in&apos;India-, and I propose, as has been d one with allprevious statements in this series, to present the text of the statement as a Command Paper to Parliament at about mid-day on 20th November, on which date it has beenarranged, I understand, to hold the debate on Indianaffairs which was to have talren place on 12th November.
TFLSC-RAM from Secretary of State for India to Governor-General, dated 13th November, 1940.personal.   Many thanks for your personal telegram dated10th November, 2.319-S&quot;.   I have carefully considered yourpreference for including in the statement some indication ofthe reasons which led the various parties to reject the offer.I agree, of course, that there would be obvious advantagesif we could be sure of stating the reasons in a way whichwould be accepted as adequate by those concerned.    Nodifficulties would be presented in describing the reasonsas regards the Congress; but the same is certainly not true of the Moslem League and still less of the Mahasabha, who might regard a statement that they had rejected the offer atall as unjustified by the facts; and I am sure again you would agree that Jinnah would- be lively to let slip no opportunity which he saw of charging us with misrepresentat-ion of the League&apos;s point of view.   On the whole therefore Iremain of opinion that it would be best to avoid this difficulty and, as you were good enough to say that you didnot wish to press your view, I am presenting my amendeddraft as you had it to the War Cabinet for approval with aview to publication here and in India on the 20th.   as youare already aware, the Commons Indian debate, which shouldhave taven place to-day, has been postponed.    It willprobably tave place on 20th.   But i will of course telegraphfurther as regards details as to publication.

REVISED DRAFT STATEMENT.On August 8th I published a statement on behalf ofHis majesty&apos;s Government.    That statement reaffirmed the attainment by India of free and equal partnership in theBritish Commonwealth as the proclaimed and accepted goal ofthe Imperial Crown and of the British Parliament.    In orderto remove all doubt as to the intentions of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as to the method and time of the progress towardsthat goal it declared the sympathy of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwith the desire that the responsibility for framing thefuture constitutional scheme of Indian self-governmentshould - subject to the due fulfilment of the obligations-which Great Britain&apos;s long connection with India has imposed on her - be primarily the responsibility of Indiansthemselves and should  originate from Indian conceptions ofthe social, economic and political structure of Indian life.It at the same time empiiasised the concern of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that full v/eight should be given to the views of minorities in the framing of that scheme and made it clearthat His Majesty&apos;s Government could not contemplate thetransfer of their present &quot;responsibilities for the peace and welfare of India to any system of government whose authority was directly denied by large and powerful elements in India&apos;national life.    The method by which these two indispensablylinked objects were to be secured was the setting up onthe basis of friendly agreement of a body representativeof all the principal elements of India&apos;s national life to devise the framework of the new Constitution.    This bodywas to be set up immediately after the war but His Majesty&apos;sGovernment expressed their desire to welcome and promote inthe meantime every sincere and practical step taken by indians themselves that could prepare the way for agreement upon its form and procedure as well as upon the principles and outlines of the Constitution itself.Meanwhile,  in order to associate Indian public opinionmore closely with the Government of India at the Centre andin the hope of promoting the unity of India by the creationof new bonds of understanding through practical and responsible co-operation in the task of governing India anddirecting the Indian war effort, I v/as authorised to inviteIndian political leaders to join my Executive Council, aswell as to establish a War Advisory Council containingrepresentatives of the Indian States and of other interestsin the national life of India as a whole.Outside/
Outside India these proposals, both in their immediate and in their larger ultimate aspects, have heen welcomed asliberal in conception and as representing the best practical solution of existing differences.    In India itself, too,they have met with the support of a large body of opinion:in their more immediate aspect, however, namely the expansionof my Executive Council, I have not secured the responsethat was hoped from political leaders in India.    The reasonsfor which they have been unable to accept the proposals ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government are conflicting and, indeed, insome ways mutually destructive.    However that may be, theeffect is that the major political parties concerned are not,in present circumstances, prepared to take advantage of theopportunity offered them.His Majesty&apos;s Government note this conclusion with sincereregret.    The proposals in question would place real power andreal responsibility in Indian hands.    Their acceptance would afford the most hopeful contribution which Indian political leaders could make at this critical time towards thepreservation of Indian unity and towards an agreedconstitutional settlement for the future.    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not propose to withdraw them, and are stillprepared to give effect to them as soon as they are convincedthat a sufficient degree of representative support is forthcoming.But as that degree of support has evidently not yetmanifested itself, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided thatI should not be justified in proceeding with the expansionof my Executive Council or the establishment of the war advisory Council at the present moment.
