The Tabular statement (Appendix B to W.P. (&amp;)(40) 324) shouldbe read in the light of the following explanation.The column headed &quot;War Establishment&quot; relates to the establishmentoriginally authorised in January, 1939 (and subsequently amended) forthe Civil Defence Services (excluding Fire and Police) of the 220scheme-making local authorities of Great Britain.The columns relating to strength give the numbers actuallyserving on a whole-time or part-time basis on the 30th September last(see paragraph 11 of Cabinet paper).     The gross surplus shewn in thelast column is the aggregate figure comprising the numbers surplus to the authorised establishments of each particular service, takingthe country as a whole.     The surplus consists, however, of part-time volunteers, who of course cannot be transferred to other areas andare not interchangeable in their own area.The gross deficiency is the total of the- shortages in the establishments for the whole country, but the shortages are mainly to be found in important industrial centres where there are labourshortages.     Whereas the surpluses relate to part-time strength, the deficiencies cover both whole-time and part-time strength.
