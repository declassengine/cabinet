Printed for the War Cabinet.  September 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 247.September 25, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.RATES OF PAY FOR THE ALLIED FORCES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.A REPORT by the French Forces (Official) Sub-Committee, dated the5th July, 1940, recommended : &quot; That His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the principle that french personnel serving under General de Gaulle will be entitled to basicBritish rates with some adjustments as regards rates of pay for naval andair force personnel to meet the special conditions which apply in those two services.&quot;By &quot;basic British rates&quot; is understood, broadly speaking, the initial ratefor each rank, without addition for length of service, proficiency, good conduct^or for performing particular duties.2. This recommendation received ministerial approval and, although it wasnot submitted to the War Cabinet, my colleagues were informed of the generalsubstance of the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendations in Paper No. W.P.(G.) (40)181of the 10th July, 1940, which came before the War Cabinet at their meeting heldon the 15th July, 1940 (W.M. 204 (40), item 8). Negotiations with General de gaulle&apos;s representatives and with the representatives of the other allied forces were conducted on this basis.3. During the negotiations claims were made for appropriate rates of pay for skilled personnel both in the Free French Navy and in the Polish Army,corresponding to those paid in our own forces.4. The whole question of rates of pay was accordingly reviewed afresh bythe Allied Forces (Official) Sub-Committee. This review, which was exhaustive,showed that no two of the Service Departments were in agreement as to thebest method of settling this question and, partly for this reason and partly because, in the view of the Sub-Committee, the solution must depend not only on service considerations but also on an appraisal of the political considerations involved, the Sub-Committee submitted to the Ministers chiefly concerned on the31st August. 1940, a memorandum setting out the choice of four alternatives.5. I have now received the views of my colleagues (the First Lord of the&apos;Admiralty. Secretary of State for War, Secretaiy of State for Air and Chancellor11169   [21770]
of the Exchequer) on the Sub-Committee&apos;s memorandum, and they have allexpressed their willingness to agree to the following solution, with which I also agree :  That the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry should be authorisedto make the best arrangements they can within the limits of their full paycodes with each of the Allied forces concerned, subject to the followingprovisos:  (a) That service in an Allied force, prior to the 1st July, 1940, shouldnot count for any increment of pay;(&amp;) That a check on the number of Allied personnel in receipt of higher rates of pay should be enforced by refusing to pay for a greater number of skilled and specially qualified personnel per unit than are provided for in the establishment of a comparable Britishunit. Exceptions to this rule could be made, where the Govern-ment Department concerned thought it necessary.6. In view of the readiness of all the Ministers principally concerned to accept this course, I do not consider it necessary to submit the question to theWar Cabinet for decision and, unless I hear from any of my colleagues in thenext day or two that they see objection to the above recommendation, I proposeto regard it as agreed.H.Foreign Office, September 25, 1940.
