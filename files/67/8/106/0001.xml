The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.November 21, 1940.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons.My peoples and My Allies are united in their resolve to continue the fight against the aggressor nations until freedom is made secure. Then only can thenations, released from oppression and violence, again work together on a basisof ordered liberty and social justice.I am confident that victory is assured, not only by the prowess of the armed forces of My Empire and of those of My Allies, but also by the devotion of theCivil Defence Forces and the tenacity and industry of My peoples. These arenow enduring, where they live and labour, the perils as well as the hardshipsof war.The staunchness of the men of the Merchant and Fishing Fleets has addedlustre to the ancient traditions of the sea.The resistance of My people has won the admiration of other friendlyPowers. The relations of My Government with that of the United States ofAmerica could not be more cordial, and I learn, with the utmost satisfaction,of the ever-increasing volume of munitions of war which is arriving from thatcountry. It is good to know in these fateful times how widely shared are theideals of ordered freedom, of justice and security.Members of the House of Commons.You will be asked to make further financial provision for the conduct ofthe war.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons.Measures will be submitted to you for compensating those whose home or business property has, at any time since the outbreak of hostilities, been destroyed or damaged by enemy attack, and for extending insurance against therisk of such damage to all forms of moveable property which are not at presentprotected.Further proposals for legislation will also be made to improve the conditionsof those who may now or in the future require assistance from public funds.Apart from these and such other measures as may be required for the effectiveprosecution of the war, My Government will take every possible step to sustain the health and well-being of My people in their ordeal.I pray that the Almighty may give His blessing to your counsels.[21921]
