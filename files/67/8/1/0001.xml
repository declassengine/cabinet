I propose, unless any objection is raised, to&apos;inform him that the War Cabinet isprepared to give him the discretion for which he asks, inconsultation with myself, as to actual numbers and otherdetails.L.S.A.INDIA OFFICE.27th July 1940.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated24th July 1940.1491-arrangements in connection with personnel for theexpanded Council or for the War Advisory Council are clearlyentirely dependent on the attitude to any statement that maybe made of Congress, the Moslem League, and-, to some extent,the Hindu Mahasabha, and one can do no more than makecontingent plans at this stage.. I think it may however be ofassistance if I let you know at once certain names I have been considering, more particularly in connection with the war advisory Council.2.       Executive Council.    If the Moslem League are prepared to cooperate, we should, I think, have to have two Moslems, oneMahasabha. Ambed^ar, probably one Sikh, and I think it very desirable :that there should be a Liberal as well.   My comments on the composition of the War Advisory Council which followare in several instances directly relevant to the composition of the expanded Executive Council.3.       War Advisory Council.   Here again everything turns on whether Congress and/or the Moslem League and the Mahasabhaare prepared to co-operate.   I think now. that we shall have to contemplate a larger body than I had originally had in view,possibly 20-25.   My idea has been to aim at a body not so muchreflecting precisely the political strength of the various parties in British India as one which would contain asufficient number of persons of standing and repute throughoutthe country to carry some weight and to represent publicopinion: while I have been anxious, too, if possible, to getrepresentation of functions such as labour and commerce.
If Congress and the Moslem League both co-operate, they arelively to make demands for substantial representation whichmay make it impossible for us, if we accept them, to go asfar as I would otherwise have wished to with the other part-ies and interests.   I doubt at the moment if we shall getCongress in.   If we do not, but Moslem League are preparedto play, and I can head Jinnan off his demand for amajority, or indeed for that matter for any substantialfigure of representation, I should be disposed to aim atsomething on the following lines:(a) Indian States.   The Jam Sahib has asked that theStates should have one third of the total representation;that being the. figure of the States representation in theFederal Lower House.   I told him that my idea for this council was as described above, and think that we shall probably beable to get him on that basis to be content with say threePrinces out of a total of about 20.    The Nizam has howevernow made formal reauest for a separate representative forHyderabad in the event of a War Council (the possibility ofwhich he heard from the Jam Sahib) being established.   Apossible compromise would be to have three princes (one ofwhom would have to be a Moslem), plus Hydari (who isincidentally Chairman of the Committee of Ministers) as representing Hyderabad.    That would have the advantage of strengthening Moslem representation (otherwise likely to benot very large) in body as a whole.(b) Moslem League.   I should have to ask jinnah fornames if he co-operates and would aim at trying to keep himto three, or just.. conceivably four.   Two obvious possibility-ies are Sultan Ahmed arid&quot; Chhatarl, and I think it desirable,subject to what Herbert may say, to have in addition aBengal Moslem.   Military representative referred to belowmight well also be a Moslem member of Moslem League.(c) Mahasabha.    If they are co-operating they would certain inly be entitled to one, and I think probably to two,members of War Advisory Council.    Savarkar has suggested tome as names for consideration in any expansion of myExecutive Council the following:   Moonje, Jamnadas Mehta,Sir Manmathanath Mukherji, Dr. s,P. Mukherji of Calcutta,Mr. L.P. Bhopatkar.    I am disposed, myself, to favourJamnadas for my Executive Council for he is a live man whohas been a Minister and is :sufficiently connected with &apos;Labour to represent that point of view as well.   On that basis I should be rather inclined to consider Moonie andBhopatkar who Maxwell thinks might be of value for War   -Advisory Council.      . ,(d) Sikhs.     We shall probably have to have a Sikh inthe Executive Council and I think certainly one in war advisory Council.   Of old generation Sir Sundar SinghMajithia is probably strongest candidate on merits forexecutive Council though I should not expect to get muchwork out of him.   But he is a man of high standing and muchexperience in Sikh community, and I see little prospect ofthat community producing any agreed selection. * it is toodivided internally.    The other two names which look likemeriting consideration are Sampooran Singh or Ujjal Singh,the history of both of whom will be familiar to the IndiaOffice.    I would not think there is a case for more than oneSikh Member of the Advisory Council-and either of these would probably do.   Another possibility is Sir Jogendra Sirga
(s) Scheduled Castes.    I would contemplate invitingAmbedkar %o jo&quot;in ray&quot; Executive Council.   He is the livostpersonality among Scheduled castes.   Most prominent ofother members of that community at the present time areRaiah and Siva Lai, both from Madras,   Latter is a memberof&quot;the Central Assembly.    I feel little doubt that if wehave Ambedkar in the Executive Council, wise course wouldbe to put Rajah in in War Advisory Council, for no isalleged to represent Scheduled castes in the South, wherethey&apos; are very important, tc a greater extent than doesAmbedkar.    The Community though not politically of very active importance does cover some 60 million people, and isone in which Parliament lias taken particular interest in tiropast and has been at great pains to safeguard,(f) Liberals.    If, as i anticipate. Mudaliar remains in my Executive Council, that would secure-a degree ofLiberal representation there from Justice Party.,   There maybe 2. case for a single Justice party representative in theWar Advisory Council, also possible candidates are Sir A.P.patro and Fumararajah of ChotiinaoJ   Other Liberal nameswhich merit consideration in one capacity or other are 1think Sir Chimanlal Setalvad (old and somewhat controvers-ial, but he has been prominent in National Liberal Peder-ation), Pandit Kunzru from United Provinces, now a memberof Council of State (a good intelligence if somewhatmeticulous, and unlikely to be an easy colleague; particul-arly interested in army problem), N.R. Sarkar, lateMinister in Bengal, though he ought perhaps more properlyto be regarded as a Congress supporter and might be reluctant to accept an invitation if Congress were not co-operating, and&quot;Sir T.B. Sapru.   I would like, if i couldfit one in, to get a Liberal of standing for my ExecutiveCouncil in addition to Mudaliar, and my disposition wouldbe to invite Sapru.   But he is a sick man and rather oldnow, and I would be disposed to give him an excuse fordeclining by mentioning his heal-oh and offering him appoint-ment to the Advisory Council as an alternative.   Of the others, Sarkar, who has been a successful and competentMinister in Bengal, would be a very useful addition to myExecutive Council.   Kunzru is of good quality, but might,, isuspect, be a difficult colleague, and subject to what ihave said above i prefer to suspend judgment for the momentas regards either Executive or Advisory Council until I seeif any other good names come my way from Governors.(g) Minor: minorities.   I think we ought to have a european on Advisory &quot;Council.   1 am disposed towardRichardson of Yules, now a member of Council of State, but would have to tave soundings about this.    If you seeBenthall, I shall be very interested in any suggestion he might have to make.    I think too, given relative importanceof Anglo-Indians, that they ought to be represented, and inthat case Sidney is the obvious man.   Finally, there is, Ithink, a case for an Indian Christian, though 1 have no nameto suggest at the moment.   The community is important,particularly in the south, and that has been recognised bythe appointment of Langanathan as your Adviser, andpreviously Pannir Selvam.    The suggestion has been put to methat Mr. Rafhnaswamy, lately of the Public Service Commiso-ion, is a possible.    I will discuss this with Hope when i see him.    I doubt if Dr. De Souza, now in the central legislature, is quite what we want.
(h) parsis.   Tliev would secure&apos; representation in my council if &quot;Metixa was selected..   -Another very good name fareither Council is Horn! Modi-   Cowasji Jehangir and Hor.iMehta are also possibles lor ordinary Council.   On meritsthesp are a 13  sound people, but i cannot of course overloadeither my Council or&quot;Advisory Council with a very small, ifimportant.: community.   If we can get any of these people,they *auld servo equally as representatives of Indiancommerce, just as European representatives would representEuropean&apos;commerce.-    I have considered Purshofamdas Thakurdasbut am not greatly attracted by the idea.    (One, Maxwell,urges on me &quot;the importance of getting some representative o.fthe Mahrati,as ii possible for ordinary Council,    it is not easy to find a name, but 1 will discuss this with Lumley),.(j) Mlscellanegus.   I think it important to have a soldier on&quot;Advil&quot;ory&quot; Gouncii .    Two names out to me are MajorNawab Muhammad Khan Tiwana or Sir Muhammad Mawas Khan of Kneboth from the Punjab.   I have seen a certain amount of thelatter who is an impressive person and a substantial iandior;Both rsuresent great Mohammedan landowning families; and we might be able to kill two birds in that way.   On the Hinduside equally, 1 am very anxious in present circumstances toencourage great landlords, and 1 would contemplate for theAdvisory Council either Burdwan or Darbhanga or both.   Laboufwould be represented in my Executive Council by jamnadasMehta if 1 could get him.    There may be a case for a Labour 1representative in the Advisory Council from some other part Iof india (I do not want to overload either of these bodieswith Bombay) if I can get a suitable name.4.        Two other names which 1 have had in mind for myExecutive Council are Jayakar (1 am rather averse howeverfrom taking a man out of the highest Judicial Tribunal forthe rough and tumble of ordinary politics) and Piros KhanNoon, who would be very useful indeed (bur here again 1should be reluctant to ask you to spare a successful HighCommissioner if I could make other arrangements).5. I realise that many of these will be little more thannames to you at the present stage, but feel sure that you arethe India Office will be interested in the line along which :my mind is moving, and would welcome any comment that you niajcare to let me have. Meanwhile 1 propose, if you agree, totake certain soundings of the Governors as to possible namesfor the War Advisory Council entirely confidentially.6,        If War Advisory Council is to attract and to carryweight, we shall have to try to do its members well.    I do necontemplate any salary for them, but I would propose, if vouagree, to give them the title of &quot;Honourable&quot;&quot; and to out theiin Article 17 of Warrant of Precedence (which will grade theiwith Ministers in maj or Provinces),   I would also give themfirst-class travelling expenses, besides subsistence allow-ance, for journeys to and from meetings.    If I can manage tosecure so long a gap, I should like to call meetings at intervals of about two months,, to last tor two or possibly three days; and I am disposed to think that it would be well that my Executive Council should be present at them,,    Thevwould take place in camera under rav Chairmanship,    The war advisory Council would be entitled bo make suggestions,raise points, receive explanations; and their function wouldin general bo to reflect public opinion to a degree that isnot, under existing arrangements, practicable.   Arrangements
would have to be made to keep them In touch with developmentsconfidentially by circulation of papers, etc., when notsitting.    I have had it in view that they should take anoath of secrecy.   Broadly, above will, I think, put youpretty well in possession of my intentions.    I need not say how much I should welcome any comments you may care to let me have.    I doubt if we shall be able to get ahead withinvitations to individuals until composition of my Counciland attitude of Congress, Moslem League and Mahasabha is defined.    If the War Advisory Council is to be a manageablebody, it cannot, I think, well exceed about 25 as total,and if it is as large as that we may have to face request from the Princes for a fourth or even a fifth Prince.    imagine that the Cabinet would be ready to give me a certaindiscretion in consultation with you as regards actualnumbers both of Princely representatives and of other::.: but would be grateful for confirmation of that.    If congress were to come in, we might have to scale down representationof interests other than the Moslem League, Mahasabha and the princes, in the interests of maintaining manageable figure.But i think it would be of assistance if in any debatefollowing any statement by me you could bring out that wewere anxious not so much to reflect party strengths as to get a broadly representative body,   as I do not contemplate thatproceedings should be by vote, actual strengths will be of less importance than personalities.
