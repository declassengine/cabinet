SECRET. /W.P.(O)(40) 278. COPY NO  V  029TH OCTOBER, 1940.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED INCREASE IN THE PITHEAD PRICE OF COALAS FROM 1ST    NOVEMBER, 1940.Note by the Minister without Portfolio., At a meeting held this afternoon at which the Presidentof the Board of Trade was present and the Treasury was represented, the Secretary for Mines brought forward the following proposals for increases in pithead prices of coal:-(i)     In the country generally l/9d. per ton(ii)     In South Wales and in Durhamalso if an application ismade from the latter coalfield 2/9d. per ton(ill)      In the Kent coalfield 3/3d. per tonAt the same time the Secretary for Mines handed me amemorandum, a copy of which is attached hereto as an annex,in which he explains why, in his view, it is essential that theforegoing increases should take effect as from Friday next,1st November, 1940.2, In view of the importance of the issues involved andof the repercussions whicii the increases proposed will inevitablyhave on the cost of living index, I felt that this was a matter1upon which a decision must be taken by the War Cabinet itself.3. I accordingly submit this matter to the War cabinet as a question of urgency for decision at its meeting to be heldtomorrow.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurs in thiscourse.(Intel.)

INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF GOAL.Memorandum by the. Secretary;, for Mines..On the 28th September an application was receivedfrom the Central Council of Colliery Owners for an increaseof the pithead price of coal by l/6dd in all districts otherthan those for which an exceptional claim for a larger increase was being put forward (South Wales 2/6d., Kent3/-d. and a possible application from Durham), these increases to date from 1st October.Negotiations have been going on for some time withthe Central Council for a levy scheme whereby the proceeds of a flat rate addition to coal prices were to be applied tothe, special assistance of collieries suffering exceptionalloss of trade including those closed but still maintained and it was hoped that the levy scheme might be introduced atthe same time as the general alteration in coal prices inorder to avoid a double charge.    Various causes have delayedthat scheme, however, and it now seems unlikely that itwill be operative much before the New Year when a further review of coal prices may have to be made.    In the meantimean immediate increase of coal prices is essential if areduction of wages in. many areas is to be avoided on thenext ascertainment and it is proposed that the additionsagreed to on this memorandum shall be effective from the1st November.    Preliminary steps have been taken in antici-pation of an increase but an immediate decision is required if the 1st November is to be the effective date-In order to make clear the bearing which prices have on wages it should be explained that in each colliery districtthere are periodical ascertainments of the net proceeds ofthe district after meeting expenses (under agreed heads).Of these proceeds 85 per cento  (in some areas 87 per cent),is allocated to wages and the balance to the owners, provided,however, that if the 85 per cent, is in sufficient to paycertain minimum rates of wages, the balance is made good outof the owners&apos; share.     This system has continued during thewar with the modification of a national flat rate addition towages based on the increased cost of living.    Where the area is already on the minimum rates of wages any further increase on the war wage addition falls entirely on the owners.During the last war the Government a.ssumed full control of the coal mines but the economic results were sodisastrous (sooner or later) for everyone concerned that onthis occasion all parties sought to avoid it and indeed toavoid also any rigid control of pithead prices.    Instead theCentral Council gave an assurance to the Mines Department thatit would not increase such orices during the war above thegeneral levels of nric.es charged by the-producing areas  at theoutbreak of war save with the -bonsetht  of-^the Department.Two general increases of prices have already beenapproved, the first of 1/- (1/4-d. in Wales) a ton from november, 1939,  and the second of 8d.  a ton from May, 1940.In both cases the basis of the increase was the rise in thecost of ooeration.    No account was then taken of the extentto which the owners had benefit ed  by the levelling up ofof export and&apos; certain inland prices.    On this occasion itwas agreed that account should be taken not only of increases in costs during the war but also of increases jn proceeds - in other words

that the basis of consideration should be the change in creditbalances.The national average of the owners&apos; credit balances per tonhas been as follows in the last few years:-Sod-Year 1935     0o6ido&apos;&quot;    1936     CVll-ido&quot;    1937     1,, 2$do&quot;    1938      lo 4d0&quot;    1939      10    7idoand in recent quarters193819391940,Quarteritiritendediiiiii31st March30th June30th Sept,,31st Declollfdo 2o 0-g-do09  3z Go-UdoGo 3i 1.  l^d0lb 9fd9 2Q  4d,2 o lg do2o l^d.The last few months have shown a striking change in the position,.Ever since the collapse of France and the loss of our main export market Durham and South Wales have found their economic positiongravely affected but more recently ether areas have felt theeffects of air attack, either in direct hindrance to working or in preventing the transport of coal to consumers0With the heavy inland demand August should have been a far better month than in previous years when much short time wasbeing worked in collieries supplying the home marketi,      Itsoutturn this year in the various districts is shown in thefollowing table and alongside are given figures for over twothirds of the pits for September:-Credit or Debit Balances for: the nionrths rSeptera.ber? 19403 ^^^^  p^sjiAugust and district AugD I940o Sept. 19400Scotland + l0    67? * 1. 4Northumberland * 0o    7f - 0o 7Durham &quot; 0o 10 - le 11South Wales &amp; Monmouth - 10    8 - 1. 11Yorkshire * 10    5 + 0o north Derbyshire )         * ln    7-g- ( + 1. 4Nottinghamshire                ) ^&quot; oSouth Derbyshire * io 11*) t 1- &apos;.PLeicestershire ) &quot;!&quot; n rCannock Chase * lo 21 ^ n ViLancashire &amp; Cheshire * 0o 2t - 0o 11North Staffordshire - 0o 1^ t 0. 5Warwickshire * 0o 11g * 2C north Wales - 0, 2f - 0. &amp;South Staffordshire * 0o 3t - i- ^Shropshire &quot;&quot; - ;r0 r-Cumberland - 0o 71 - g0 1Bristol - 23 7-2 - ^0 *Forest of Dean * lo 84- * lo 11GREAT BRITAIN -1- 0*    8  + 0.

The basis of the industry&apos;s application for an increase,l/6d. in areas other than South  /alejs, Durham and Kent was that %in August the general level of credit balances in such areasaveraged l/3d. a ton.      It was known that from 1st October anadditional hid. a ton on the average would be made in the war wage and that Workmen&apos;s Compensation would cost an additional 2d.a ten.     Without any further deterioration of the position,therefore the average credit balance for these areas (he.excluding the three mentioned) would be only 9d3The Central Council claimed that the industry was entitledto an increase of l/6d. a ton from the 1st October, bringing the credit balance to over 2/- a ton.     The validity of the pre-warfigures of returns as a basis of reference was stronglycontested on the ground that the industry was known to be in abad financial position and that the Government had taken action under the Coal Mines Schemes to improve prices generally and to foster the export trade.     While giving &quot;full weight to this lineof argument the Mines Department were disposed to press for a rather lower rate of increase than l/6d, but evidence began topour in as to the continued downward trend of the industry,This evidence is summarised in the table above and showsthat over the whole country the average position worsened betweenAugust and September by no less than 8d. a ton and in the whole area excluding South  /ales and Durham the change was from anaverage profit of l/3d. a ton to 9d,,In these circumstances the Department felt that theclaim for an increase not far short of 1/6d. a ton (though noton the basis of the August results alone) could no longer be refused if the risk of a- reduction of wages on the nextascertainment was to be avoided, but unfortunately (for thereasons given above) the decision to proceed without waiting forthe levy scheme was not reached until it was too late to makethe change effective before the 1st November.      To give the equivalent of l/6d.  increase over the three months v/ould needan increase of 2/3d* a ton in November and December.     While itmay be necessary to contemplate a further review in January itis felt that an immediate increase of this order would have toograve repercussions on industry and the cost of living for it tobe accepted at any rate until events have proved the case for itbeyond any doubt.      Instead I propose - and I have obtained the aquiescence of the Chairman and Director of the Central Councilto this course - to limit our approval to an increase of l/9d.to operate from the 1st November in all areas ether than the exceptional cases mentioned above.     This may be regarded either as an average increase of 1/2. a ton for the quarter or as 6d.extra for October and l/6d* for November and December.,      for south  /&quot;ales I think that *a further l/-, making 2/9d,  in all, is justified by the financial results there and an equally good case could be mr.de out for Durham,  if that district thinks itin its interests, to claim a higher rise in price than thatapplying   to its neighbour and chief competitor, Northumberland.I ask,  therefore, for the authority to approve an immediate increase of pithead prices in the country generally of l/9d.a ton from the 1st November and of 2/9d0 in South Wales andpossibly Durham, with special consideration on merits for thesmall but highly important Kent coalfields(Intdo) DoEoG..s Department,29TH OCTOBER,  1940.
