IjTgjYlfllflfflra is THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; s GOVERNhTENT.  copy no.    \yo(40) 310.(25th November, 1940).war     cabinet.SKILLED WIRELESS PERSONNEL.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. i agree generally with Lord Hankey&apos;s recommendation at 12(a) of w.P. (G) (40) 311, hut I do not tnink an Order enforcing prohibition ofmanufacture for the home market (to which I assume Lerd Hankey&apos;recommendation is restricted) is in fact necessary.     For the nextrationing period of six months, &quot;beginning December 1st,  sales of thearticles in question will be cut down to about 20/5 of the quantity of previous trade in the comparative period last year.      i am advised thatthe stocks are so large that it will take a long time to dispose of them at the rate of 20t;    thus all incentive to new manufacture will beremoved by the restriction,    A monthly census of production is howevertaken,  and i will review the matter when the next monthly returns areavailable.2. The question of manufacture of radio sets for the home market is mainly for the Ministry of Information since that Department is interestedin maintaining the numbers of those who listen to the wireless in this*        country.3. I will have the question of the export trade in radio sets examined in order to see whether any curtailment is possible.     The Ministry ofInformation are also interested in the reception of British programmes in oversea countries.o.L.Board of Trade,25th November, 1940.
