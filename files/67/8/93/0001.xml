SOUTH.,,ATLANTIC,. AIR MAIL.ROUTES ,Memorandum by the Ohairraazi, Standing interdepartmental committee on Censorship^The Committee desire to recommend to Ministers theestablishment, at the earliest- possible date, of a british air Line across the South Atlantic, bet-ween West Africa andSouth America,,This service would have important advantagesfor Britishprestigej propaganda and trade in South Americas      In addition would be of great value to the Censorship and therefore tothe prosecution of economic warfare, which depends to an extent not generally realised on the flow of information obtained by the Censorshipj, and especially on leaving no meansof commum&apos; o otion untapped.?2,        It is the aim of the Censorship to compel neutralsountries, by all means available, and especially by the useof the ship navicert system,  to send their mails only by suchroutes as are open to examination by our censorship organisation,3,        It is clearly desirable,, from the censorship point ofview, to extend this control to the South Atlantic, but airmails from South America can escape examination because of thecontinued operation of the Italian LoAeT0Io Service which runsfrom Italy to Natal (Brazil) via Malaga (Spain) and Sal Island(Gape verde)0     It is also known that a German Lufthansa Service,between Dakar and Brazil-,  is now being organisedok-o       A careful examination has been made of all the measures that might be taken to eliminate the L.AaToIo Service    and toprevent the operation of the projected Lufthansa Service.    Allsteps open to us are already being taken to deprive the enemycontrolled air services of supplies of aviation spirit, andsome success has been achievedo      It is. not, however, possible by this means seriously to impede either service.      In addition,it has been found impracticable, for technical reasons, toattempt forcible interference with the service by naval orR.A0IV aircraft05*       We have reached the conclusion that the only course open to us is the exercise   of pressure on the South american republics to compel them to refrain from sending air mails to europe by enemy controlled services, but the Foreign office are unwilling, on political grounds, that such pressure shouldbe applied unless and until His Majesty&apos;s Government.can offersuitable alternative routes,      It is also evident that unless we can give an alternative service; we cannot expect anywilling co-operation from the Portuguese Government in denyingsupplies to the enemy air lines in the Cape Verde Islands,

6i       We understand that the Air Ministry, while fullyappreciating the importance of establishing a British Air Lineacross the South Atlantic - certain preliminary plans for whichwere made before the War - hare no suitable civil aircraftavailable for this Service.-.     -Moreover:, the civil aircraft which they have in prospect will be repaired for employment on the Service between the United Kingdom and West Africa, theestablishment of which was authorised by the War Cabinet on23rd July last (W*M,(iiO) 210th Conclusions,. Minute 2 (III)),7.       The Committee have no wish to recommend the alterationof the existing priority laid down by the War Cabinet)    they recognise the Vital importance of developing, as early aspossibley by means of the civil air link to West Africa,communications with the Middle East and British Empire countriesin the Par East, &quot;but they would urge that the South AmericanService should be instituted immediately after the link to west Africa, upon which it will,  in fact, itself depend.   .8.       The Committee accordingly recommend that approval inprinciple should be given forthwith for the starting of aBritish Air Line across the South Atlantico     Quite  apart fromthe ether advantages referred to in paragraph 1 above andwhich may well be thought sufficient in themselves to justifythe service,  it should have the effect of narrowing and perhapsclosing the gap in the Censorship netu which is at present provided by the enemy controlled services and which is a seriousweakness in the whole organisation of the blockade.     We are assured that the financial outlay involved would be fully justified by the stoppage of the present contraband traffic in financial instruments and in small but highly valuablecommodities j, by denying to the enemy a means of rapidcommunication with South America which, is of great value to histrade and financial operations and by making available from theneutral mails carried by our service information of the utmost importance for the prosecution of the blockadeo9,       .Lf our recommendations are accepted in principle wesuggest that the following immediate steps should be taken?-(a) His Majesty5s Representatives in the South american countries concerned should be informed of our intentionto start this service as soon as possible, and shouldbe instructed to approach the Governments of thesecountries with a view to securing the necessary landingrights o(b) The Air Ministry,, working through the British overseas airways Corporation, should press on urgently with thepreliminary arrangements, e0go by the earmarking of thenecessary staff, the preparation of the groundorganisation on both sides of the South Atlantic, theworking out of timetables, etcc(c) The Air Ministry should review the possibility of securingaircraft suitable for the operation of such a service,either by diverting them from existing or prospectiveresources, or arranging for the Ministry of aircraft production to place new contracts in the United states for accelerated deliveryDSigned on behalf of the CommitteeWALTER MONCKTON.Chairman,richmond Terrace, S.WAo6th November, 19A.00 -2-
