THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3.-GOVERNMENT.: Secret.rgjG) (40)880.,ifith August, JL540.WAR cabinet copy NO. 5&quot;tTRADE RELATIONS WITH EIRE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.-   At their meeting on the 6 tA of August the War cabinet considered the proposed agreement with Eire.      The mainconcession proposed to be made to Lire under this agreement would give Lire the United Kingdom price for her fat cattle,less a sum representing the pre-war subsidy to home-cattle, in return for certain undertakings by the-producedEireGovernment, of which the most important related to shipping.The War Cabinet asked the Minister of Shipping to circulate amemorandum on this aspect.      This has now been done asWP(G)(40) 213.The proposed agreement has been further discussed the Minister ofthiscattleamongst the Ministers primarily concerned.Food has explained that by the recent increaseyear of the price paid &apos;by the Ministry of food in the home market, Eire producersautomatically benefit.      If pricestheir present level, as desired bythe nett gain to Eire producers ofat about  1,060,000 annually.      Iflevel proposed by the Ministryabout  600,000 annually.      The Minister of Food therefore feels that Eire   farmers have already received sufficient additional assistance since the present negotiations started in April,and that there is no case for a further subsidy by way of increased prices for fat cattle.in Junefor fatof store cattle willwere to be maintained atthe Ministry of Agriculture,r store cattle is estimated? prices are fixed at theFood,  that gain would beOn the other hand,  it is   clear that the eire government will not be prepared to sign an agreement unless there is some direct advantage to be obtained by them and bythe Eire farmers from the terms of the agreement itself.      Theywould maintain that the increased prices paid for store cattledo not operate to safeguard the cattle industry as a whole.It is agreed that the only practicable method of giving Eire whatshe wants is the proposed concession on fat cattle.      It has,therefore, to be decided by the War Cabinet whether theadvantages which would be derived from the conclusion of theagreement as a whole are worth a concession to Eire on fatcattle.     Arrangements could be made to limit the value of this concession to about  500,000 a year.The advantages which the United Kingdom would derive from the proposed agreement may be summarised as follows:-

Si(l) Eire would be required to undertake to facilitate the use of Eire ports for the trans-shipment ofgoods from deep sea ships to smaller ships,  should that course become necessary ovying to therestriction of port facilities    in -Great Britain.The Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Foodattach considerable importance to such an arrangement.(2) From the Board of Trade point of view it isdesirable that the 1958 Trade Agreement with Eireshould be maintained.      That Agreement containedvaluable concessions to and safeguards for UnitedKingdom exports,  for which Eire is an extremely important market, and if is essential that we should avoid giving Eire any excuse for disregarding her obligations to us under the Agreement,      Moreover,Eire&apos;3 economy is complementary to and notcompetitive with that of the United Kingdom, and action should be avoided which would tempt Eirefurther in the direction of economic self-sufficiency.If past experience is any guide, a feeling in Eirethat the prices received for primary produce in theUnited Kingdom market are inadequate,  is liable to lead to a movement towards such self-sufficiency.(3) There are the political advantages which wouldresult from an agreement with Eire,  which were referred to in rny previous memorandum WP(G) (40)  204of the 2nd of August.(ltd!)
