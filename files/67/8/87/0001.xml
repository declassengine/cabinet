2 5 secret.W.P.(G-K40)287a5TH NOVEMBER,  1940.WAR CABINET.100 OCTANE fuel.Completion of the Thornton PlanteMemorandum by the Chairman of the Oil Control Board.,I recommend, that the Thornton ^lant should becompleted because:-10 We ought to insure against bomb damage to Heyshamthe only other large 100 octane plant in the country,,2, It would be wise to reduce our dependence upon &apos;American supplies.     Even assuming full production fromHeysham we should need at least 350,000 tons from theUnited States in 1943^ if we have not got the Thorntonproduction0      Sir Andrew Agnew, who represents theindustry on the Oil Control Board and has just returned from New York, estimates that the U.S.A. production in1943 will be 2,000,000 tons? and that her domestic consumption will by then have reached 1,000,000 tons, if sheis not^at war0     If she is at war, and having regard to^EEeTact That she has no reserves, he estimates that her own needs will be very large and we may have difficulty in meetingthe whole of our requirements03o We ought to err on the side of safety in regard tothis vital war fuel.     No allowance has been made for losses in transit or destruction of stocks04. The work is already well advanced.      Theexpenditure to date and orders placed amount altogetherto  3,500,000, of which I understand possibly  750,000 mightbe cancelled on tej-tfcjSo(Initialled)    GaL.)COPY NO.
