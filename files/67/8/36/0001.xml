SEC RET.W. P. (G) (40) 856c12TH,. SEPTEMBER, 19401COPY NO.WAR CABINET.FAMILY AND DEPENDANTS ALLOWANCES,FOR MEMBERS OF THE FORCES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.At their Meeting on 7th August (W.M.(40)221stConclusions, Minute No.  1) the War Cabinet considered thequestion of family and dependants allowances in relation tothe proposal then before them of increasing pay by 6d.  aday.      They decided, that the former question shohld beconsidered, independently of the latter.The following Tables show adjustments of the allowances which are acceptable to the Service ministers and to myself.Family Allowances.WifeWife andtiitti1254childchildrentittPresent17/-23/-27/-29/-32/-3/-Each extra childDependants AllowancesPresentNet contribution beforeenlistmentExceeding Not exceeding9/- 15/-15/- 20/-20/-Special rate for &quot;lone&quot;Dependantrates12/-17/-20/624/-New18/-25/-30/-34/-38/-4/-Newrates13/-18/-21/625/-Under peace time regualtions the allowances for children are subject to a sliding scale based on cost-of-living changesSuch a scheme cannot in practice be satisfactorily operatedconcurrently  with a system of ad hoc revisions;    (it hasalready caused an anomaly in the present rates whereby the allowance for the third child is less than for subsequent children);    1 therefore propose that the opportunity shouldbe taken of formally abandoning the sliding scale scheme.The War Cabinet expressed the view that &quot;it wouldprobably be better that any increase in these allowances shouldnot take place until, say, the 1st October having regard to the likelihood that the cost of living would rise over the next two months.&quot;     But arrangements cannot be made for introducing-1-

the new rates on the 1st October, and it is proposed thatthey should operate as from the most convenient pay datenear to the 1st November.The cost of the revised rates may he put at approximately  5 million a year for each million men.(Intld.)
