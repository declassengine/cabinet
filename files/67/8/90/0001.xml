Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.SECRET Copy No.:1 1W.P. (G.) (40) 290.November 5, 1940.WAR CABINET.OVERSEAS AIR COMMUNICATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE primary role of British civil aviation in support of the war effort isthe maintenance of our overseas air communications.The rapid conveyance of pilots and equipment required to maintain thefighting efficiency of our squadrons abroad, of secret plans and directives for all three Services, of Staff Officers and emissaries, of personal mail for His Majesty&apos;forces, of couriers and despatches for the Foreign Office, Dominions Office,Colonial Office and the India and Burma Offices, of British newspapers,periodicals and other publications sent out by the Ministry of Information, ofthe business correspondence on which our export trade depends and of overseasmail generally, demands a steady and increasing effort.The Present Position.2. When war began, the main trunk of our Empire air communications ranvia Marseilles, Rome, Brindisi and Athens to Alexandria. Thence one routewent eastwards via Iraq to India, Burma, the Malay States and Australia;another southwards to Khartoum, Kisumu, Lourenco Marques and Durban. Aspur, now of great importance, ran from Khartoum westwards to Lagos andTakoradi, and another (which is still running) north-east from Bangkok to HongKong. This year, a new service is being operated across the Tasman Sea to new Zealand.Durban-Cairo-Sydney.With the entry of Italy into the war, our main trunk route through theMediterranean was severed. Then came the fall of France, which denied to us the landplane alternative which had been planned to run across France to Oranand by a loop through French Equatorial Africa to Khartoum. accordingly the Empire flying-boats were&apos; no longer able to connect with the United Kingdomand have had to be restricted to a &quot; horse-shoe &quot; service running from Durbanto Khartoum and Cairo thence across India to Australia.It remains to link the United Kingdom with this &quot;horse-shoe&quot; service.This can only be done at present by a flying-boat service from the UnitedKingdom to Lagos connecting there with a landplane service using the spurroute from Takoradi across Central Africa to Khartoum and Cairo.
West Africa to Cairo.     .      . &apos;The aircraft at present available, for the spur route across Africa are threeLockheed 14s and three L\H. 86s (which are neaxing the end of their useful life).One more Lockheed 14, one more D.H. 86 and two .J.U. 52s. (which are german aircraft for which few, if any, spares are available) are in course of erection at oron their way to Lagos by sea.  The loads we can carry with this fleet are small.United Kingdom-Lisbon. ....On; the flying-boat part of the route, we have established services from theUnited Kingdom as far as Lisbon, which is now the front door of Europe. This1,000-mile run is done in one hop. At Lisbon, we also connect with the UnitedStates trans-atlantic service. We began the Lisbon service in May, and it nowruns twice weekly with our own flying-boats and four times weekly with D.C.3landplanes chartered from K.L.M. The service may have to be curtailed duringthe winter, months, when daylight is short.United Kingdom-West Africa.From Lisbon southwards, our flying-boats have to make a hop of twice the distance^ namely, the 2,000 miles to Bathurst in Gambia. As five long-rangecivil; flying-boats have been diverted to the R. A.F., we now have only two Clareand Clyde-that can do the stage.    -   -The North A atlantic.The flying-boats Clare and Clyde were temporarily earmarked for flights toFoynes, Botwood, Montreal and New York. Only one has been so employed.Throughout the season one has had to be used on special runs to Lagos. At the close of the Atlantic season in the middle of October both of these flying-boats weremade available to provide a link with Lagos. This will be better than nothing but it will certainly not meet operational requirements.3.   So much for the present position. ^Immediate Needs.4. As regards the immediate future, I am being urged to operate newservices or strengthen existing ones Avhich are important in our war effort. TheForeign Office, for example, want a British service between Egypt and the Balkansfor urgent official traffic. The Ministry of Information have also made demands.Most pressing, of course, is the demand from all three fighting Services, as wellas from the G.P.O., and from the Colonial, Dominions, India and Burma Offices,for a service of greater frequency and capacity on the route United Kingdom-Lisbon-Lagos-Khartoum-Cairo.The British Overseas Airwajrs Corporation have not so far been able tomeet these requests owing to a shortage of aircraft. The position will, however,shortly improve or be capable of imposed&apos;ovement, and I set out below theprogramme which I propose.West Africa to Cairo.   .5. Taking first the route from West Africa to Khartoum and Cairo, it isimportant that a rapid service should be available to carry essentialitems of equipment, such as spares, required by R.A.F. squadrons in the middle east and beyond, as well as to carry back to Takoradi the pilots who will beferrying military aircraft continuously along this route. There is also a heavydemand for the carriage of priority passengers, propaganda material, despatchesand also mails for the Forces.I need hardly emphasise how much the maintenance of morale among thelarge and increasing numbers of British naval; military and air personnel in theMiddle East will be helped by a reasonably quick air-mail service By fast ship to Takoradi and air onwards, the transit time froni England to Egypt is rather-over a fortnight; by air all the way, Cairo could be brought within eight days ofLondon.A conservative estimate of the loads to be carried each way oh this routeis over 8,000 kilos: a week.
1 have fortunately been able to arrange with the Nethcrlahd authorities1 that two of the D.C.3&apos;s of KX.&apos;M. chartered to the British Overseas, Airways Corpora -tion should be flown to Africa for use&apos; on this route (even thouglv this nmy: be&quot;atthe expense of the Lisbon service) arid they are being1 :&apos;m:ade&apos;&apos;avail^ble&apos;!a^ quickly as possible. &apos; ;&quot;:&apos;&apos;&apos;v  :iu/;&apos; &apos;iVMoreover, by arrangement with the Ministry of Aircraft Production, thereare already on order in the U..S.A. for the Royal Air Force 8 LockheedL8des&apos;tars.The Royal Air Force are prepared to loan these aircraft to the Corporation for communication work on the Central African route. I propose that these Lockheedshould be so used as and when they are delivered. 5 &apos;   . 5    1Even with this fleet, requirements will not be fully met. -We have ascertained that the Douglas Aircraft Corporation can promisefairly early delivery of D.C.3&apos;s up to a total of ten. They would be suitable forthe Central African route and would cost about $ 100,000 each; This offer;remainsopen for the moment, but unless an order is given promptly, the prospects of earlydelivery will recede. v &apos;It would be possible to use (and indeed there would be advantages an, using)Armstrong Whitworth Ensigns, of which British Overseas Ai rways corporation have eight available in this country. They are excellent aircraft, having .a.pay-load of approximately double that of the D.C.3&apos;s, but they cannot be used onthe long hauls across Africa until they have been re-engined with Americanengines. The engines and necessary spares were ordered before the war andhave now been delivered.The work of installing them consumes a large number of man-hours andthe Minister of Aircraft Production has hitherto been unable to spare labour for this purpose. But in view of the importance of this requirement I would suggest that this work should now be done.United Kingdom-West Africa.For the flying boat route to Lagos, we shall have, in addition to Clyde andClare, the two and possibly three Boeing Clippers which were recently orderedin the U.S.A. The first of these large craft will be delivered in February next,the second in March and the third, if we get it, in May. They will be anessential reinforcement. They will also be a necessary insurance against therisk that landing facilities in Spanish or Portuguese waters may be denied tous- if that happened, only the Clippers could do the 3,000-mile hop from thiscountry to Bathurst.North A atlantic. . . . .Even if the Clyde and the Clare had not been urgently needed for the service to West Africa they would have had to be taken off the trans-Atlantic run, duringthe winter months owing to the risk of icing and to the fact that, for a goodpart of the winter, the flying-boat base at Botwood is frozen up; and these boatshave not the range needed to enable tihem to. fly straight from Foynes to New York.Nor have they the f ahge to enable them to be used on the South Atlantic route in winter.All the Departments concerned want the transatlantic flights to be resumedas soon as possible; and napid air communication across the Atlantic is ofparticular importance to the Air Ministry and the Ministry of aircraft production in view of the big flying-training and aircraft-building programmes in North America. The United States Authorities also hope that our trans-Atlantic flights will shortly be resumed.Unfortunately, we have not at our disposal at present any aircraft capableof, maintaining an all-the-year-round trans-Atlantic service. If not fitted witharmaments, the Consolidated Bomber B. 24, which is one of the bombers po-w beingmanufacturescl for the United States Army, would be,suitable for such: flights;ahck ^ this type, we should hope to, be ableto make a series of flights across the North Atlantic during the coming months.T understand that : the United States Authorities are willing to releasetp. us not more than six aircraft of this type (without military equipment), whichare due for delivery to the United States Army. It would be a condition of therelease that we should replace them with machines from our own contracts forthis type of aircraft when these fall due for delivery.
I suggest, therefore, that not less than three and not more than six of these aircraft should be obtained for the trans^Atlaiitie service inv exchange for asimilar number from the order for 120 of (his type which has already been placed by the Ministry of Aircraft Production, but none of which is due for deliverybefore next February. &apos;        &apos; &quot;:- &apos; -    ! -       -      &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;&apos;   ;The British Overseas Airways Corporation have the necessary trans--Atlanticoperational experience, and they have agreements for trans-Atlantic services: withthe Governments of Canada, the United States and Eire. -I propose, therefore,that, if a service to be operated with the B. 24&apos;s is approved, it should be run bythat Corporation as are overseas services generally. I propose also that theMinistry of Aircraft Production should have priority rights on the load capacitymade available by this service.The Balkans, Aden, India and the Far East.I come now to the services which radiate from Egypt. Aircraft will be needed for a new British service from Cairo to the Balkans; also for a service from Cairo to Aden which is primarily a military requirement. The antiquatedAtalantas on the route from Egypt to India must be replaced. The D.H.86&apos;soperating from Bangkok to Hong Kong should also be replaced; they are ancientaircraft which will in any case be unable to operate to Hong Kong if Indo-China,is closed to us.The British Overseas Airways Corporation propose to base on Karachi theS D.H.95&apos;s (Flamingos), which they have on order from De Havillands and touse them to operate to Egypt and thence to the Balkans via Adana and Istanbul(or alternatively via Athens) as well as to Aden; they will also be operatedeastward across India and Burma to Bangkok and on to Hong Kong.Cape to Cairo (landplane).There is also a requirement, to which the Air Staff attach high importance,for a landplane service up the centre of Africa from the Cape. The i*e-enginedEnsigns will be invaluable on this route.Sweden.6. This picture of our civil aviation activities would not be complete without reference to the irregular service which we are at present operating from theNorth of Scotland across to Sweden with a Lockheed 14. I understand that this service is of considerable value to the Foreign Office and to the Ministry ofInformation. It will now have to be suspended owing to the approach of winter and the unsuitability of the Stockholm aerodrome in winter conditions for the lockheed 14 which is the only aircraft we have available. I should propose to resume it, in due course, with one of the Consolidated Bombers which the U.S.Administration are willing to release for the assistance of our civil aviation.South America.7. I ought also to mention that the Ministry of Economic Warfare are anxious that a British air-link with South America should be provided in orderto strengthen our hand in persuading the South American Republics to diverttheir mail and freight from the existing Italian air service. The establishmentof a British service to South America would also make it easier to press thePortuguese Government to withhold fuel supplies from the Italian and projectedGerman services. Deutsche Luft Hansa are taking active steps to resume their pre-war service to South America, which may commence at an early date. I amconsidering the possibilities.Summary of ProjJosals.8.   Summarised, my immediate proposals are: -(a) the maintenance of the present service to Lisbon;(b) the provision of a long-range flying-boat service between this country andLagos;(c) a   landplane   service   of   greater   frequency   and   capacity   betweenTakoradi, Lagos and the Middle East;
(d) the re-equipment of the landplane service between Egypt and India andon to Burma, Bangkok and Hong Kong;      .... . - ....(e) a service between Egypt and:the.Balkans; . , , i(/) a service between Egypt and Aden; .,..*.(g) a service up the centre of Africa from the Cape;    ,      /(h) the maintenance of the flying-boat service from Durban round the &quot; borse--    shoe&quot; to Australia; , ,(*&apos;) the maintenance of the trans-Tasman service which is operated jointly.with Australia and New Zealand; ,       .     &apos;.(j) the resumption of trans-Atlantic flights as soon as possible; 1    /(k) the resumption of the flights to Sweden as soon as possible.For these services, British Overseas Airways Corporation will require inaddition to their present fleet and to the Flamingos they already have on order  (i) the 8 Lockheed Lodestars on order in the United States of Amerioa forthe Royal Air Force,(ii) the 6 Consolidated bombers which the U.S. Administration are willingto release for civil aviation purposes. ,(iii) the 10 Douglas D.C. 3s which are obtainable if an early order is placed.(iv) the 8 re-engined Ensigns. ,The only new dollar expenditure involved in these requirements would bein respect of the purchase of the ten D.C. 3s at a total cost of about Si million.A.
