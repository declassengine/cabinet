COPY NO.    ^ ^WAR CABINET.POOD SITUATION,Memorandum by tlio Chancellor of the exchequer on the Note by the Minister of Food (W.P.(G)(40T2149)I much regret that I was unable to be present at the informal meeting of Ministers held in the Prime Minister&apos; room at the House of Commons on Thursday, the 8th August,when the proposals dealt with in the above note were considered.      They raise wide issues which I should have wished to discuss.I am rather doubtful of the utility of a series ofgeneralisations so broad and so capable of varying inter-interpretations as is set out in the paper*      Importantfinancial problems are also raised.Proposition (i) is unexceptionable as a generalexpression, but everything depends on what is meant by&quot;reasonable precautions&quot; and &quot;undue&quot; restriction of food supplies.      The present position, as determined by thePood Policy Committee, Is that the Ministry of Pood is towork to a basic import programme of 15 million tons, witha supplementary programme in which commodities are to beArranged in order of priority,,      The supplementaryprogramme is to be operated so long as, and to the extent that, shipping is available to meet it;    but consumptionis to bo restricted so far as possible to the limitations of the basic 15 millions ton programme.      The idea is that what is provided under the supplementary programme, withthe exception of a relatively small quantity of perishablefoodstuffs, shall be stored, and the&quot;purpose of the supplementary programme is to make use of tonnage availablein excess of the basic programme for the purpose ofincreasing storage.      Is there any sufficient reason forgoing beyond what has already been decided by the Poodpoi i o.v Oomrni ttee?Proposition (ii),      I agree, if it does not imply a direction to increase imports for the purpose of increasingexisting rations.prongsition ( i ii ). relates to an issue which alsoappeared incidentally; &quot;in the Paper W.P. (G) (40)203,submitted by the Minister of Economic Warfare and consideredby the War Cabinet on 9th August (W.M,(40)223rd Conclusions,Minute 4).      i feol great hesitation in acceding to a policy-1-(TrTS DOCUMENT IS T.-IE PROPERTY 0&quot; 111,3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S G0VERNf 3NT. )SECRET.W.P.

of filling tills country with foodstuffs unless the limits of policy are defined by reference to the strictly practical considerations by which we are governed.      We cannot afford to buy such stocks without limit even if they come from the sterling area;    certainly not if they involve heavy dollar expenditure,,      There are limits, also, to our capacity tostore   them even if we can get them through our ports.About proposition (iv) I feel serious misgivings8Notwithstanding the swift and anxious growth of generalexpenditure, we are continuing to subsidise the cost of food at a very expensive rate*     As a &apos;result the cost of essentia!foodstuffs has been kept fairly steady for many months.      to add to that Exchequer expenditure further large bulk sumsis not a course I can easily contemplate.      Nor do I believethat in present conditions greater stability in food prices will prevent increases of v/ages.      The immense pressure forcertain types of labour in vital industries, combined withgeneral effects of the 100% Excess Frofits Tax, will be amuch more potent and continuous cause of wage increasesunless that matter is systematically controlled.      Thepresent course of wages from that cause gives me anxiety.The question of food subsidies is raised in greater detail by a paper L0Po (41)26 of 3rd August submitted by theMinister without Portfolio to the Lord presidents committee and shoiild, I think, be further discussed there.Propositions (v) and (vi)o      I have no observations.(Intlda) K.W.Treasury Chambei^So15th August, 1940.
