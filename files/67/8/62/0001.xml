SECRET.W.P.(G)(UO)  2620ALLOCATION OF CEMENT FOR THE IASTQUARTER OF^gUO.REPORT BY THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO.1. I was asked &quot;by the War Cabinet at their meeting on 2nd September (W.M,(l+o)239th Conclusions, Minute II) toreport to them as to the allocation of cement. I haveinterpreted this as referring to the allocation for thelast three months of 19U0o2.     After a provisional allocation had been worked out,it was reported to the meeting cf Ministers dealing withshelter policy that the shelter position -would he very unsatisfactory on the &quot;basis of the allocation for cementproposed for this purpose, which was little more than a third of the quantity asked for by the Minister of home security.      I explained that efforts were being made toincrease the output of cement, or rather In the firstinstance to reduce to the smallest dimensions the inevitabledecrease under winter conditions7 hut that these measures could not have their full effect during the current quarterjthat some margin was available for an increase in theallocation for shelters, hut that any considerable increase would mean some reduction in the allocations to the bigconsumers, i.ec the Service and war production Departments.I gave it as my opinion, however, that those departments should find it possible&apos;to offset by economies the effectof such reductions so as not to hold up essential worksfland on this basis I suggested an increase of nearly 150,000tons in the allocation for the shelter programme.3.     A table is attached showing the Departmental demands and the revised, allocation which I have now approved.It will be noted that -(1) total demands amounted to roughly double theav ai1ab1e supply;(2) the demands of the Service Departments amountedto roughly two thirds of the available supplyand of the war production departments to roughlyanother third0     To grant these allocations infull would leave nothing to any other Department,whereas the demand of the Ministry of Home Securityalone for the shelter programme was for nearlyanother third of the available supply;lltTH OCTOBER. 19h0.COPYWAR CABINET.\

1 b /(S)    the principle followed, in the allocations hasbeen&quot; to impose the smallest reduction on thehigh priority work of the Service and supply departments, in particular the Air Ministry,and the most drastic cuts on the low prioritywork of other Departmentse4. This gives what is;  in my opinion, the proper priority to the Service demands and in particular to those of the AirMinistry for aerodrome construction.      If I had given themtheir    demands in full and also the amounts required for war production factories, there would have been very little left for the shelter programme and nothing at all for carrying onthe essential life and work of the country,  (mines, power stations etc).     An allocation which had this effect would clearly defeat its own ends,5. Naturally my allocation has pleased nobody and all departments have protested in varying degrees against the quantities allotted to them.      The Secretary of State forAir has brought his difficulties before the V/ar Cabinet inhis paper W.P. (40)415.,.   and   he has been good enough first togive me the opportunity of discussing fully with him possible economies and in particular the possible greater use of tarmacfor runways, etc,6. He told me that only about 2^yo of his programme was forbuildings, etc,, offering a field for economies in the use ofcement comparable to that to be found in factory construction.In this small field ho assured me that his department wouldmake every effort to secure economies in conjunction with theBuilding Research Committee.7. The rest of his demands for cement, i.e. some 570,000tons, are for runways, perimeter tracks., roadways, etc.Experience may show that the thickness and strength of cementused for these purposes can be still further reduced, but no evidence has been submitted to me to suggest that the AirMinistry can, at this stage, be asked to take the risk ofmaking such further reductions.8. The Secretary of State satisfied me that operationalconsiderations make tarmac unsuitable for seme aerodromes and that in certain parts of the country its use is out ofthe question.      He also explained to me that its use in anycase had certain disadvantages;    it involves difficulties oflabour and of the transport of materials with consequentrisk of delays in completion.      I appreciate these difficulties:but I am not satisfied that the Air Ministry have paid properregard to the shortage of cement in deciding in borderline cases which material should be used,      I consider that there couldbe an increase in the number of contracts for the use oftarmac in the latter half o:&apos; the current quarter without unduerisk of delaying the programne.

9. Within the last few days I have been given informationas to the probable supply position which justifies me in increasing the total allocations for the quarter by 50,000tons.     I recommend that this should be added to the AirMinistry allocation thus bringing their total up to h3U,515tons as compared with their demand for 595,000 tons.     Butas essential civil services must be continued, and as the munition factory programme and the shelter programme recentlyauthorised must receive their shares of available supplies,I can see no way of increasing the Air Ministry allocationabove this figure.10.       I therefore ask the War Cabinet to decide as follows:-The allocations of cement for the currentquarter should stand as in the tableattached, with the addition of 50,000tons for the Air Ministry.Any additional supplies that may become available during the currency of the quarter should be made available to .the Air Ministry so far as requiredfor the completion of the approvedaerodrome programme.The Secretary of State for Air shouldbe invited to make good any resultingdeficiency by the increased use oftarmac in borderline cases and bypostponing any work not essential forthe operation of the aerodromes in thefirst instance.11.       The Secretary of State for Air refers not only tocement but to other building materials.     In the case ofthese the principle of priority has been applied on thesame general basis as for cement i,e. the Air Ministry havebeen allotted the largest quantities possible consistent with the maintenance of other war services and the essentialcivil services.     Every effort will be made to make larger quantities available for the Air Ministry, if it is found possible to do so consistently with this principle.     Forthe same reasons as in the case of cement I ask the WarCabinet to endorse this line of action.(Intld, )     A.G.(D(2)(3)Treasury Chambers, S.W.1. ,lUTH OCTOBER, 19*40.
