fTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE.PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.come&quot;)W.P.(94(40) . 272. COPY NO.?^rd October, 1940.WAR CABINET.IMPROVED STREET LIGHTING.Memorandum by Minister of Home Security.The War Cabinet considered the Report of the Black-Out Committee(W.P.(40) 375) on September 20th.     It was agreed (W.M/40/ 255 Minute 7)not to take a final decision upon the Committee&apos;s Report but to authorise a number of preparatory steps recommended by the Committee to be taken.The Prime Minister indicated that the aim should be the introduction of an    jimproved street lighting scheme in November, should that be found possiblewhen the time came without unnecessary risk.The preparatory steps recommended by the Committee were as follows:-(a) A review of the Air Raid Warning system should beundertaken and the possibility of introducing asupplemental system of localised area warnings shouldbe examined.(b) A full scale test of the visibility of differentintensities of lighting should be made in some suitabletown.(c) The views of local authorities should be ascertained andthey should be invited to prepare schemes for their areas.The review of the Warning System has been carried out by a committee under the Chairmanship of Air Vice Marshal Peck, and the Committee&apos;sReport (W.P.(40) 417) has been approved by the Cabinet (W.M.(40) 270 Minute 4)Arrangements were made at Paisley for a full scale test of thevisibility of different intensities of lighting.     On the first occasionweather conditions did not allow aerial observation but it is hoped to repeat and complete the test this week.The question now arises whether or not a circular should be issued tolocal authorities to implement recommendation (C).     In my view it wouldbe wise to postpone this action for a time.     I have reached this view,with reluctance, for the following reasons:-(i) The intensity of air attack has not diminished since the question of street lighting was considered by the Cabinet, and I am afraid that the time has not yet come when we could contemplate the introduction of a lightingscheme.(li) I think it is very unlikely that local authorities or the public generally would be in favour of any brighter lighting at present.(iii) If it is accepted that a lighting scheme is not yet practicableI am reluctant to impose any further work upon local authorities, even of a preparatory nature, when they are so fully occupied with A..R.P. work.

(iv) An improved lighting scheme would, as the Report of the black-Out Committee showed, cost a substantial amount of money.     until we can be more certain of the practicability of a scheme I do not &quot;wanteither to suggest to local authorities that they should bear this expenditure - a burden which they would be most unwilling to assume -or to take up the question of an Exchequer Grant.For all these reasons I suggest that we shall be well advised to defer the issue of a circular to local authorities and furtherconsideration of an improved lighting scheme until the intensity ofair attack is reduced.When the circumstances are such as to make the introduction of ascheme possible, we should be able to introduce it at all events in aconsiderable number of places without serious delay.H.M.MINISTRY OF HOME SECURITY.23rd October, 1940.
