&apos;g!S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)iEGRET.WAR   cabinet future OF THE CHILDREN1S OVERSEAS RECEPTION SCHEME *Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1.     In my capacity as Chairman of the Civil Defence Committee I attach a copy of a letter addressed to me by the Chairman of theChildren&apos;s Overseas Reception Board raising several points which seemto call for immediate decision.2.     My own view is that, having regard to recent experience, nofurther parties of children should be sent overseas under theGovernment scheme in slow convoys;    and indeed I gravely doubt whether in present circumstances we should be justified in allowing children toproceed overseas under the Government scheme even in fast convoys.3.     If this view is accepted by the War Cabinet, it will involve thetotal suspension of the Government scheme for the evacuation ofchildren overseas.      In that event it would seem right that thenecessary ojaatourksexieivt should be made by the Government rather than bythe reception Board.4,     As regards the arrangements for the reception of children in theUnited States, I suggest that the position should be explained fully and frankly to Mr. Biddle.     He will no doubt be concerned to know what are the prospects of our being able to re-open the scheme at some later date;    and on this point I suggest that he should be told thatthe operation of the scheme has been temporarily suspended and that asregards the future no definite statement can be made until it is seenihow the war situation develops.\j?J Qt) (40)246.ifith.

CHILDREN&apos;S OVERSEAS RECEPTION BOARD,45, Berkeley Street,W..1.25th September, 1940.Dear Home Secretary,I am writing to ask if you would kindly advise me as to whatpolicy the Children&apos;s Overseas Reception Board is to pursue in viewof the recent activity of German submarines.You will remember that.the War Cabinet, on the advice of myBoard, decided, that no children could go overseas unless in convoy.At the time we were hoping that escorts might be provided for the fast liners on the North,Atlantic&apos; route.     The adverse development in the War situation&apos; laid more important duties on the ^Admiralty andall naval vessels have been required for other purposes. &apos;   TheLord Privy Seal consequently announced the postponement of the scheme on July 16th, but he pointed out in a Supplementary that therewould be a certain/number of children going where it was possibleto provide&apos; for their.being properly convoyed.   - We have thus been authorised to&apos;use the normal conveys by including slow passengerships to-carry our children. . &apos;Altogether just over 3,000 children have&apos;&apos; left;&apos;   1,811 havearrived and 859 are still en route, and appear to be beyond thedanger zones.      The balance have been torpedoed,&apos;   .In the .1ast fewweeks, however, the risk of proceeding in slow convoy has beenbrought&quot; home to us by -the torpedoing of the Volendam, with 322children on board, and the disaster &apos;to the City of Benares.      Therewere no casualties in the1&apos; former case but in the latter 83 &apos; out of the90 children were drowned.      This means that one in seven of ourchildren sent overseas have been in ships torpedoed, and in perilof their lives, or in terms of ships, two ships have been lost outof eighteen sailing.      As the wintry conditions prevail in theNorth Atlantic we cannot expect boats to be launched with any degree of safety when. a^.ship is torpedoed, and even if the convoyis still maintained we must -expect.-a heavy ^casualty roll.      If a convoy has been broken the chances of rescue arc still more remote,as was shown in the case of the City of Benares.After reviewing all the circumstances my Board recommend thatduring the winter months at any rate no more children be sent overseas in slow convoy.      The Advisory Council endorse thisrecommendation.      My Board further ask that the Government should decide whether or not it is safe under present conditions to sendchildren in fast escorted convoys which are now being tried.     Wehave, for example, been offered over two hundred places in each oftwo ships of the Duchess class in October, and further places inthe Caledonia.Would you also be good enough to ascertain what reply I could make to Mr. Biddle who has been sent over by Mrs. RoosevelfsCommittee to find out the prospects of British children going to america.      I have told him unofficially that there is hardly any chance of children going in British ships in view of the very limited numbers available.      If America sends ships they will cometo Ireland and they will only come if Hitler gives a safe conduct.That is extremely unlikely.     Whether this prerequisite isconsidered vital remains to be seen.      It does seem, however,that the chances of American &quot;Mercy Ships&quot; taking our children are remote.      If this is so Mr. Biddle feels it would be better
to close dovm the American organisation than to allow it&quot;tocontinue and funds to he raised with all the consequent    . . - -disappointment, and perhaps anger, that all their hard work has ,;been in vain. &apos; &quot;-    &apos; ;.&apos;    -Mr. Biddle is anxious that the Guardianship Bill shall, inany event he passed- to regularise the position&quot;-&apos;of the tlipushrids &apos;of British children that have gone out independently or are ;J\vgoing out&apos;under the&apos;voluntary scheme of the American Committee;.I should he grateful if Mr.- Biddle can be given an official reply as the nature&apos; of it may affect -the.. whole attitude of America&apos;-to &apos;our cause,;      - -       &apos;- -  &apos; ---   . -:      . tYours ever, * - -(SIGNED)    Geoffrey Shakespeare, ;The Et, Hon.
