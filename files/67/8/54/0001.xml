Few(TEES DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITMNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERMENT).SECRET Copy No; 5UWP (C)  (W) 2547th October,1940.WAR cabinet air Raid DamageCensorship of Press reports.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.1 *. The aim of this paper is to propose a clearer policy withregard to reports of air raid damage in the Press and on the &quot;wirelessthan has appeared up to date.     The problem is not concerned with the contents of the official communiques issued by the Air Ministry and theMinistry of Home Security: but with the degi-ee of restriction which oughtto be imposed upon the ordinary news reporting of events which areoccurring every day in the heart of our own country.This is a censorship problem.2. The Censorship has received from these two Ministries variousinstructions as to securitjr reasons for suppressing news of air raid damage. Three ,main categories appear:-(a) The nature of the target may be such that its injurymust not be given away, e.g. an armament factory, amain railway station, a power station;(b) The enemy raider may have been so ignorant of hiswhereabouts that even the town or area attacked oughtto be concealed in order that the information may notbe used to correct his navigation. This principle isvery generally applied to night raids (and even today raids) except on London or Liverpool;(c) Even if the town is made public, no objective hit,however harmless, ought to be mentioned as a general rule, for fear of correcting the aim or navigationof the enemy. This is an extension of (b), but very far reaching in its effects.3. The chief trouble has arisen over the application of (c).The Air Ministry have regarded it as a general rule from which exceptionscan be permitted, but they claim that only they should decide what isto be an exception and what not.    Their general line has been to permitspecific mention of damage to some places to which special sentimentattaches (e.g. Churches or Buckingham Palace) or outstanding &quot;news value&quot;(e,g. West End drapers shops or the offices of the Associated Press ofAmerica).4. The results of this practice have not been very satisfactory(1)     It has mystified the public who, unaware of the reasons,  -orany particular release, have been unable to see why someobjectives have been mentioned, and others not. They attributethe non-mention of those suppressed to some sinister desire to suppress details of damage done.
(2)    The objectives released have nearly all been in London.This has aggrieved the Provinces, particularly big cities,which have suffered very heavily but feel that they are beingignored in comparison with London0(3)   It has removed from the Ministry of Information its properfunction of controlling news.   Under present conditions theproblem of stopping or releasing mention of particularobjectives arises, literally, continuously,,   Yet there isno one, however high an official in the Ministry, who is ina position to answer Yes or No to an enquiry whether aparticular objective may be mentioned;    he can merely reply that the matter must be referred to the Air Ministry. It isimpossible to conduct an effective censorship on such lines,5. There is no strong public pressure for the release of morenews. What is wanted is a clear statement of a rule to be followed forthe future with as much explanation of the reason for it as can safely be given0I therefore propose;-(1 )   The Cabinet should decide that the policy of prohibitingmention In the Press or E0B, C.  of particular objectives hitin air raids should be firmly adhered to and that thepractice is to be departed from only in really exceptionalcaseso(2)    The duty of working out&apos;this policy and of deciding uponproper exceptions from It should be entrusted to theMinistry of Infoioation. with the assistance of the AirAdvisers to the Censorship in the Ministry.   Any generalsecuritj&quot; instructions on this subject which the AirMinistry desire that the Censorship should observe mustbe followed., but it is a fundamental principle that the censorship should be responsible for the conduct of itsown worke The present- system. Is the more anomalous Inthat the grounds for exceptional release are entirelymatters of publicity, and the responsibility for deciding&apos; on such cases lies properly with the Ministry of Information,which is in constant touch with nevra0(3)   The Ministry of Information should take steps to see thatthe policy to be adopted is made known not only to the Pressbut to the public with as much explanation as it is reasonably^safe to give., This will remove the present sense of confusion Iand mystification and enable the Provinces to nee that forthe future they will be placed on a parity with London.(4)    The Ministry of Information should, farther endeavour toarrange with the Press a more satisfactory method ofreporting damage to objectives which are not released,For instance circumlocutions which give away the placedescribed to a large number of people, and references toanonymous hospitals arid schools which cause needlessagitation and disti-ess to man:&apos;/&apos; people, ought to be avoidedoIt is impossible to take effective steps in this directionso long as the Ministry is unable to assume any responsibility!in the matter, .4D0C0October 7th, 1940.
