Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.SECBET. Copy NqW.P. (G.) (40) 312.November 20, 1940.WAR CABINET.OVERSEAS AIR COMMUNICATIONS.Report by the Chairman of the Committee on Overseas Air Communications.THE composition and terms of reference of my Committee are set out in annex A.2. We have been unable to reach agreement on the problem before us. i therefore set out below the various considerations which bear on the allocation ofexisting and prospective aircraft to be made for our overseas air communications,together with my recommendations on the issues at stake.3. There is, on the one hand, the considerable importance of maintaining our overseas air communications between the United Kingdom and the Empire,the Middle East and not least the U.S.A. Constant interchange of high priority passengers, official documents and of small cargoes such as spare partsfor aircraft, mails particularly for armed forces and propaganda material all of which require high-speed transportation-has, if possible, to be provided for.*On the other hand, however desirable such traffic may be, our urgent require-ments for fighting aircraft must be met. In this connection, the First Lord ofthe Admiralty drew our attention to the imperative need for further long-rangeaircraft for escort convoy work.4. Accordingly, I have had considered by the Air Staff the suitability forfighting purposes of the new aircraft proposed for our overseas air communications.These aircraft are : 3 Boeing Clippers (on order).8 Lockheed Lodestars (on order).6 Consolidated B.24&apos;s (special release from United States supplies).10 Douglas D.C. 3&apos;s (not ordered).8 Ensigns (but to be engined with American engines) (enginesdelivered).8 D.H. 95&apos;s (Flamingoes) (8 on order; of which 3 delivered, 5 to 1come).* The Secretary of State for War, the Minister of Information, the Minister of economic warfare and the Postmaster-General are all pressing for an increase in all these communications.[21936]
The Clippers, Lodestars, Consolidated B. 24V and Flamingoes will be delivered complete with engines. The new Douglas D.C. 3&apos;s are hot yet ordered;but could be delivered early and would require engines to-be diverted fromMinistry of Aircraft Production supplies in the United States. The Ensignsrequire re-engining with American engines.Use might also be made of certain part-worn civil D.C. 2&apos;s, D.C. 3&apos;s andLockheeds on order in United States by the Ministry of Aircraft Production,which will shortly be available, in addition to or in substitution.of some of theabove aircraft.5. The Air Staff report on the suitability for military purposes of theaircraft detailed above is as follows :  These aircraft fall into 3 groups:  (i) The Clippers. These flying boats might in time be made available foruse on anti-submarine patrol duties. The time required to convertthem, and their exact suitability for the purpose, cannot be predictedwithout fuller knowledge of the structure of the aircraft than is atpresent available. As an example of what may be involved, the3 G-Class civil flying boats which have been taken over by the R.A.F.for operational use will require about 10 months to convert. On this basis, as the first Clipper is not to be delivered until February 1941,it is unlikely that it could be available until the end: of that year;the other 2 Clippers, which are for delivery in April-May 1941. couldnot be made available until early 1942. It would, therefore, be unwise to sacrifice the immediate use of a first-rate transport aircraft for itsproblematical military value at a future date, by which time there is every reason to hope that military flying boats will be coming forward from America in adequate quantities. In passing, it should be notedthat the Focke-Wulf Condor, which has been the aircraft mainly usedfor attacks on shipping in the N.W. Approaches, has a maximumspeed of 250 m.p.h. : the maximum speed of the Clipper isabout 170 m.p.h.(ii) The  Consolidated B.24 is  a military bomber  type.    It  must beremembered, however, that the six now offered for release in advanceof the British contract will be delivered without armament, and thatsome time would be needed to equip them as bombers. Furtherequipment would be required to make them entirely suitable for anti-submarine patrol duties. The possibility of installing this has yet to be established.(iii) There are three types of transport land planes : the Lockheed Lodestar,the Douglas D.C.3 and the Ensign. None of these can be satisfactorilyconverted to military use as fighters, bombers or general reconnaissance aircraft.It would appear, therefore, that only the Consolidated B.24&apos;s will be useful for convoy escort or other military purposes.6. The Minister of Aircraft Production has drawn our attention to the adverse effect of recent enemy air action on our engine production. He informed us that, if he is to meet the demands for fighting aircraft made upon him bythe Admiralty and Air Ministry, no engines will be available for aircraft forour overseas air communications. He states he may even desire to remove the engines from some of the aircraft detailed in paragraph 4 above in order to installthem in fighting aircraft. The Minister of Aircraft Production also informed us that he intends to approach the War Cabinet with a proposal that the wholeof the personnel (pilots, mechanics, wireless operators and so forth) of the british overseas Airways Corporation should be handed over to his Ministry for production purposes.For these reasons the Minister is opposed to the retention or allocation ofany aircraft Avhatsoever to our overseas air communications.
7. The principal-air routes in the order of priority laid down by the AirStall are as followsn&quot;! - , .(i) United Kingdom-Lisbon-West Africa-Middle East.(ii) South Africa-Middle East.(iii) Cairo-Aden.(iv) The &quot; Horse-shoe &quot; service, Cape-Cairo-India-Far East-Australia.(v) North Atlantic Service.(vi) North of Scotland to Sweden.(vii) Bangkok to Hongkong.(viii) Trans-Tasman Service.(ix) Balkan Service.(x) South American Service.The Air Staff are of opinion that the provision of transport aircraft forthe first two of the above services should have equal priority with the provisionof military aircraft. It is, they state, a military requirement that tihese services should be maintained, whether by the E.A.F. or by the British Overseas airways corporation, and neither the B.A.F. nor the B.O.A.C. at present possess thenecessary aircraft.The above, of course, takes account only of Air Staff considerations, buthaving regard to the requirements of other Departments involved all of whichare related to the prosecution of the war I am of opinion that the followingservices in order of priority should, if possible, be maintained :  (i) United Kingdom-West Africa,(ii) The &quot;Horse-shoe&quot; Service West Africa-Cairo-Australia,(iii) Cape Town-Cairo.8. To maintain these services the British Overseas Airways corporation will require 3 Boeing Clippers (already on order).8 Lockheed Lodestars (already on order).8 Flamingoes (already on order; 3 delivered. 5 to come).10 or more part-worn D.C.2&apos;s or D.C.3&apos;s or Lockheeds.I recommend that these aircraft should be made available to the Corporation,the exact number of part-worn aircraft to be determined by the Secretary ofState for Air.The following aircraft, which require engines, will not then be required : 8 Ensigns the Wright engines for these already delivered can there-fore become available for military use and the project for the10 new D.C.3&apos;s should not be proceeded with.9. There remains the question of the North Atlantic Service, which wouldrequire for its maintenance 6 Consolidated B.24&apos;s, which, as is set forth inparagraph 5 above, could be put to military use if they were re-equipped. these aircraft are part of an order of 120 due for delivery in the Spring of 1941, andon balance I am of the opinion that we should accept this reduction in our futurebomber strength in view of the importance of the North Atlantic route.10. The points, therefore, which I submit for the decision of the WarCabinet are : (i) Are the aircraft detailed in paragraph 8 above to be made available tothe British Overseas Airways Corporation ?(ii) Are 6 Consolidated B.24&apos;s to be made available for the North Atlanticservice ?11. So far as the Trans-Tasman Service is concerned, this is an Inter-Dominion Service with aircraft owned jointly with Australia and New Zealand.Before abandonment the implications will have to be examined with these governments.K.
