(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 SGOVERNMENT)secret.P.(G)(40) 358 Copy No. -UK17th September 1940YfAR cabinet india AND THE WAR;    ATTITUDE OF CONGRESSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for India.With reference to the conclusions of the War Cabineton 16th September, I circulate the full text, as receivedby neuter, of a resolution adopted on 15th September by theCongress Wording Committee.   It will be seen that theterms of this resolution are very different from those ofthe intercepted draft on which the Government of India&apos;recent proposals were based.   Consequently no question atthe present moment arises of giving immediate effect tothose proposals.The Delhi resolution of 7th July 1940 as^ed for. the setting utd &quot;t a provisional national government commanding the confidence of the elected members of the Legislature,and declared that, if this were done as an earnest ofIndia&apos;s complete independence, Congress would be able to throw its full weight into efforts for the effectiveorganisation of the defence of the country.   To that extent it involved a departure from the doctrine of non-violence.It is now declared to have lapsed, with the consequencethat Mr. Gandhi is able, as he has been requested to do,to resume the guidance of Congress.I am asking the Government of India for their comments on this latest resolution.   The next step will befor Mr. C-p.&apos;idhi to seeV an interview with the Viceroy.   Thematter has, in fact, been left by Congress in his handstill he is in a position to report his conclusions.Jj. S. ANDIA OFFICE.17th September 1940.

ifcSUTJi&amp; iaiiibbAGE y*MM SIMLA daxed 16th SKPThMffix, 1940.The following is the full text oi the resolution passed by the working committee of the All-India Congress in Bombay yesterday (15th September, 1940);;:The All-India Congress Committee- has given its careful attention to eventsthat have taken place since its last meeting held at poona on July 27th, 1940,and to resolutions passed by the &quot;Working Committee at Wardha in August last.&quot;The Committee approves and endorses these resolutions.&quot;In order to end the deadlock in India and promote the national cause inco-operation with the British people, the Working- Committee, even at the sacrifice of Mahatma Gandhi&apos;s co-operation, made a proposal to the BritishGovernment in their Delhi resolution of July 7th, 1940, which was subsequentlyapproved by the, All-India Congress Committee at poona.;;This proposal was rejected by the British Government in a manner which left no doubt that they had no intention to recognize India1 s independence andwould, if they could, continue to hold this country indefinitely in bondage forBritish exploitation.&quot;This decision of the British Government shows that they will impose theirY/ill upon India., and their recent policy has further shown that they will not even tolerate the free expression of public opinion in condemnation of associatingIndia in the war against Germany against the will of a vast body of people ofIndia and of exploiting her national resources and man-power for this purpose.&quot;The All-India Congress Committee cannot submit to a policy which is adenial of India&apos;s natural right to freedom, which suppresses the free expression of public opinion and which would lead to the degradation of her people ana totheir continued enslavement.&quot;By following this policy, the British Government have created an intolerablesituation and arc imposing upon Congress a struggle for the preservation of honour and the elementary rights oi the people.&quot;Congress is pledged under Gandhi&apos;s leadership to non-violence for xheindication of India1 s freedom.     At this grave crisis in tho movement for nationalfreedom, tho All-India Congress Committee therefore requests him to guide congress in the action that should be taken.&quot;The Delhi resolution, confirmed by the All-India Congress Coiaaittoo at poona,which prevented him from so doing, no longer applies.     It has lapsed.&quot;The All-India. Congress Commit too sympathize with the British people as wellas the peoples of all the other countries involved in the war.&quot;Congressmen cannot withhold their admiration for the bravery and enduranceshown by the British nation in the face of danger and peril.     They can have noill will against then and the spirit of satyagraha (passive resistance) forbidsCongress from doing anything with a view to embarrass them.&quot;But this so If-imposed restraint cannot be taken to the extent ofself-extinction.m&quot;Congress must insist on the fullest freedom to pursue its policy based on non-violence.&quot;Congress has, however,  no desire at the present moment to extend non-violentresistance, should this become necessary, beyond what is required for thoPreservation of tho liberties, of the people.P.T.0.
- 2 -&quot;In view of certain mis apprehensions that have arisen in regard tothe Congress policy of non-violence, the All-India Congress Committoodesires to state this afresh and to make it clear that this policy-continues notwithstanding anything contained in previous resolutions which may have Led to those misapprehensions.&quot;This Committee believes in the policy and practice of non-violence,not only in the struggle for swaraj (home rule), but also in-so-far as this may be possible of application in Iroo India.&quot;The Committee is convinced that recent world events have demonstrated that complete world disarmament is necessary and the establishment of a new and more just political and economic order, if the world is not to destroyitself end revert to barbarism.&quot;Free India will, therefore, throw all her weight in favour of -worlddisarmament and should herself be prepared to give a load in this to theworld.     Such a lead will inevitably depend on external factors and internal conditions but the State would do its utmost to give effect tothis policy of disarmament.&quot;Effective disarmament and the establishment of world peace by the ending of national wars depend ultimately on the removal of the causes of wars and national conflicts.     These causes must be rooted out by the ending of the domination of one country by another.&quot;To that end India will peacefully labour and it is with this objective in view that the people of India desire to attain the status of a free and&quot;independent nation.&quot;Such freedom will bo the prelude to close association with othercountries within the comity of free nations for the peace raid progress ofthe world.&quot;
