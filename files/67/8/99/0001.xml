SUPPLY OF MACHINE TOOLS.

Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio.

In his Paper W.P.(G)(40)286 the Minister of Aircraft Production has raised the question of the supply of machine tools. It has not yet been possible to complete a calculation of the machine tools required for carrying out the approved service programmes and for other essential services, but outstanding machine tool requirements over the next twelve months, for the Ministry of Supply, are in the region of  £25m, while in W.P.(G)(40)286 the Ministry of Aircraft Production requirements are said to be in the region of £30m, making a total of £55m.

2. After making allowance for machine tools which will have to be surrendered to the United States authorities and for late deliveries it is estimated that deliveries during the next six months against outstanding orders of the two Ministries (Ministry of Aircraft Production £9m and Ministry of Supply £6m) are not likely to exceed 50%, say £7½m, while of the outstanding French American machines amounting to £10m not more that £5m (£3m for Ministry of Aircraft Production and £2m for Ministry of Supply is likely to be released.

3. Of the total requirements for the two Ministries of £55m therefore not more than £12½m is likely to be available in the next six months from America.

4. The balance of requirements, viz. £42½m, must be obtained from three sources:-

(a) Home Production over the next 12 months:

(b) America - during the second six months:

(c) Second-hand sources at home, and in the United States of America.

5. Home production over the period from now till the end of 1941 should reach a total of, say, £20m.

6. The total output of United States capacity is estimated to be at least £40m in the second six months of 1941. It is possible that this may be increased by enlarging capacity.

On 2nd November the Machine Tool Controller after consultation with the Inter-Services Committee and the representative of the Treasury, instructed the British
Purchasing Commission to consult the American authorities with a view to placing a further order of  10m fermachines for delivery July-December, 1941.    We are awaiting^confirmation that this order is acceptable.It is estimated . (paragraph.2 above) that  7-gm efBritish-Orders and  5rn of French Orders, i.e.  12-g-m in. all will have Lbeen surrendered or will still be. outstandingat the end :6f June,; 1941* . If the Americans :could be persuaded to. deliver; machines to .the^;value of:i thesurrenders plus the. outstanding.orders in the second sixmenths of 1941; as well as K toolsvtcv the---value pf  iOm,which it is now proposed to order, the total deliveriesfor. that six.months would-be  222m,,,.:  -It is toocoptimistic to expect that this  22^-m. is likely.- $6.materialise.The total deliveries therefore, available from hortfe:and American production to meet the-balance.vof requiremerats:&amp;   42-g-mr:for the two Ministries alone-&apos; (paragraph 4) will certainly be:less than  42^m09.        It is impossible to make an assessment with any degree of accuracy of what can be obtained from second hand,-sources, but it could hardly be of the order  of more than 2 to  3m.   &apos; The shortage which is likely to arise mayindeed be of the order of  15 to  20m. depending upon(a) the amount of American deliveries.(b) the requirements of interests other thanthe Ministry of Supply andthe Ministry of Aircraft Production;and(c) replacements o10.      There is a Machine Tool Control (under the Ministryof Supply) and there, are p fwers to exercise a full control,in pursuance of which it is possible  to:-(a) divert, foreign orders and British production to the most useful purposes irrespective Ofthe date on which orders are placed and ofthe Ministries or Contractors on whose behalfthey were placed:(b) move machines in existing:factories which arenot in full use or which cannot be broughtinto full use within a reasonable time owingto the lack of balancing plant.11.        In opder to make the right use of the statutory authority full information must be available to the machine Tool Controller as to the programmes of the SupplyMinistries, i.e. he must be fully informed as to thenumber of machine tool-.      rtrirsd to complete the approved programmes within the stated dates;    if fullsupplies are not forthcoming part of rthe programmeswi.ll inevitably be delayed.      In deciding what production should be delayed in this way&quot;regard will be &quot;paid to thedecisions of the War Cabinet as to strategic priority.
12. &apos;    The Minister of Labour and National Service hasdealt with the question of machine tools for govern-ment training centres in his Paper W.P.(G)(40)295.Machine tools are at present being allocated forthis purpose in accordance with the decision of theWar Cabinet on 21st October (W.M.(40)274th Conclusions^Minute 5).13. I, therefore, propose that:-(a) All possible support should be given toour representatives in the United states who are trying to secure for us as large a proportion as possible of the orders for machine tools already placed there.(Paragraph 2 above).      Mr. Purvis,Director General of the BritishPurchasing Commission, will be here in afew days and his first hand account ofthe situation will enable us to judge whether a special approach to thePresident or Mr. Morgenthau would betimely and helpful.(b) Every to.fort should be made to putthrough the further order for  10m Americanmachine tools mentioned in Paragraph above.(c) All schemes in this country involving theuse of machine tools should be examined and reviewed and in particular full information should be made available tothe Machine Tool Controller to enable him to verify the machine tool requirementsof the service programmes.    (Paragraphs 10and 11 above).(d) The available supplies of machine tools .should be allocated so that the programmesmay be completed so far as possible by the dates planned.&apos;    any inevitable delays tobe in accordance with the decisions of theWar Cabinet as to strategic priority.(Paragraphs 11 and 12 above).(Int?d) A.G.14TH NOVEMBER.   1940.
