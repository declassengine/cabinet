boeet- copy mo.$$a) 277!9th October, 1940. WAR CABINETIMPERIAL WAR CONFERENCE.PROPOSED MESSAGE TO MR. MENZIES.In the attached telegram our High Commissioner in theCommonwealth of Australia reports that Mr. Menzies has suggested a meeting in London of a conference of Prime Ministers and has indicated that he himself would be willing to come to london for this purpose.It will he recalled that in April last we proposed tothe Dominion Prime Ministers that an Imperial War conference should be held in London this summer.     The replies thenreceived made it clear that such a conference was impracticable.General Smuts expressed doubts as to the desirability of aconference this year and indicated that for political reasons it woula almost certainly be impossible for him to attendhimself.     Mr. Mackenzie King observed that the value of sucha conference in existing circumstances was &quot;extremely proble-matical&quot; and expressed the view that the proper place for him-self, as Prime Minister, was in Canada.     Mr. Menzies, thoughstressing the political difficulties which his absence wouldinvolve, gave us to understand that he would be ready to come.No reply was received from New Zealand, but the position thereis different since the present Prime Minister, Mr, Eraser, wasin London in November, 1939, when he was Deputy Prime Minister.There is no reason to suppose that General Smuts or mr. Mackenzie King have changed their views, and a full con-ference would therefore be impracticable.     From the Union of   &apos;Siouth Africa there is no one whom General Smuts could usefullysend as his deputy, while it is at least doubtful whether mr. Mackenzie King would agree to send anyone with thenecessary authority.There are really two issues with which an ImperialConference might be expected to deal:-(i) Discussion of immediate problems, i.e. the best method,of winning the war;(ii) Preliminary survey of the situation which will arise when the war is over, and the steps that can now be taken todeal with it.As regards (ii), there is force in the argument thatit is yet too soon for a conference to handle a subject of thiskind.      (I) on the other hand,  can to a considerable extent bedealt with in separate discussions, such as the meeting between mr. Eden and General Smuts, and the proposed visit to thiscountry of Colonel Ralston from Canada.     From this point ofview, a visit to this country by Mr. Menzies, even if the otherPrime Ministers could not come, could be of great value andmight
might assist very much in stimulating the Australian war effort.I suggest, therefore,  that we might reply toMr. Menzies pointing out the difficulties of the conferencesuggestion at present, hut indicating that we should welcomea visit by himself to London, and I attach a draft telegram to our High Commissioner on these lines, for con-sideration.CRANBOHNiu.

CYPHER TELEGRAM

COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA

From the United Kingdom High Commissioner in the Commonwealth of Australia.

D. 23rd October, 1940.

R. 23rd 16.06 hrs.

No. 377 Secret.

The Prime Minister dined with the Sedgwicks last night and I was present.

After dinner he brought up the question of an Imperial War Cabinet which is again being given prominence in the press as the result apparently of an article in the London Daily Sketch.

He repeated the view reported in my telegram No. 135 of the 10th May and earlier in my telegram No. 207 of the 20th September, 1939, namely that an Imperial War Cabinet was impracticable because it would be unwieldy, but more especially because the Dominions could not afford to have their Prime Ministers permanently absent, and, so far as he could see, none of them had any one other than the Prime Ministers whom it would be worth while to send.

He went on to say that he did feel however that occasional conferences at which all the Commonwealth Prime Ministers (except of course EIRE) would be present would be most valuable, and he thought that it would be desirable to hold such a conference at a quite early date.

Important events might occur at any time in the Middle East in which Australia and New Zealand and, to a less extent, South Africa were vitally interested. There was undoubtedly a feeling (which he did not himself share) in Australia that United Kingdom was keeping the Dominions a bit at arms length in the conduct of the War policy; and a meeting of the kind suggested, especially if it were known that others would be held from time to time, would, he was sure, be extremely well received.

Furthermore it would impress upon the world the solidarity of the Empire. He himself would be most willing to attend such a conference, whether in London or Canada or the Union of South Africa: it would he thought, be particularly appropriate if they were to meet in the city which the Nazis claim to have devastated. He felt sure that the Opposition could be trusted to keep quiet during a temporary absence of this kind.

He expressly asked me to transmit these views to you adding that he was sure that the suggestion for such a conference ought to come from the United Kingdom and not from the Dominions.

DRAFT TELEGRAM TO THE UNITED KINGDOM HIGHCOMMISSIONER IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.No. Secret.We have considered question raisedjin your telegram of23rd October, No. 377.Would you please let Mr. Menzies know that we should bevery glad indeed to see him in London, and hope very much that he will be able to come.He will remember that in April last we suggested themeeting of an Imperial Conference in London this summer,but it was then found impracticable to arrange such aconference, since both Mr. Mackenzie King and General Smutsfelt it impossible to attend themselves, and moreover feltdoubts as to the advantages to be derived from a fullconference in existing circumstances.     We have no reasonto suppose that their views on this point have since changed,and while we should still welcome the holding of a conferenceat as early a date as would be reasonably convenient to allconcerned, we doubt whether anything would be gained by putting forward now the suggestion that a conference mightbe held forthwith..But even though a full conference seems at presentimpracticable, we should warmly welcome a visit byMr. Menzies himself to London, as we are sure that there area number of problems which could best be dealt with by personal discussion.
