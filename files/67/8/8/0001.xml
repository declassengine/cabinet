W.P. (G)( AO)208.&apos;7th August,  19u1.-WARCAB I N E T.FOOD    ANDTHE    BLOCKADEMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of Economic Warfare.1. The present policy of H.M.C-.  is to &quot;blockade enemy and enemy occupied territories, including &quot;unoccupied&quot; France.,and to prevent the entry into this Enslaved Area of any goods which would aid the enemy in his war effort.    Such goods,of course, include foodstuffs. .2.. It is now proposed by some persons, whose opinionsare entitled to respect,  that we should relax the blockade tothe extent of allowing foodstuffs, in considerable Quantities-,to enter &quot;unoccupied&quot; France.    Other- persons are conductingan agitation- in favour of piercing other holes in our-blockadein order to permit the entry of food into other sections ofthe Enslaved Area.    This agitation rests upon a combination of sentimentalitys  ignorance and producers&apos;  self-interest.Unless firmly handled soon, it may . develop into a formidableobstacle to British victory. &apos;3. It is my considered opinion that our present policy should not be varied and that the blockade should-be maintained in full force.    But we must take active steps to removeignorance, particularly in. America.    We should also, I think,soon make a clear and positive declaration on the conditionsin which we will. .allow food into Europe. - - -li. There will only be &quot;famine&quot; and &quot;starvation&quot; in Europethis winter, if the Germans deliberately starve some sectionof their victims..    The Germans have, in fact, boasted of their ability to feed the enslaved territories and in a broadcast ofJune 27th, stated--that, while Mr. Hoover&apos;s plan for relievingFrance, Belgium and Holland deserves commendation&apos;,  the german forces had already.taken all the necessary steps.    They have  ,also declared that Germany herself had a reserve of seven million tons of bread-grains at the end of June.    There was a furtherreserve of some two: million, tons in the enemy occupied areasat this date.    If the Germans distribute this reserve, plus ...this 37-ear&apos; s harvest, &apos; equitably among the populations under their control,, there &quot;will be, even if the harvests are verylight., enough grain and potatoes to sustain life, with a margin of calories in hand, throughout the Enslaved Area until the harvest of .1941 is gathered.Further, condensed.and dried milk suitable for childrenis produced in large quantities in the Netherlands., and insmaller quantities in Switzerland, Germany and France.    Mostof this product- was imported into the U.K. before the war, andis now ail available for&apos;consumption in the Enslaved Area.The plain truth is that there, will be no famine in any part ofthis Area, unless either.the. Germans snatch away food whichis there now, or .refuse to allow food which is not far away&quot;to be moved-to where It is most needed.    The responsibilitytherefore, for local famine,-if such should occur, will be Germanand/
Nor do. I believe, that it. is possibles, anywhere, within, theEns 1 ave d Are a,&quot; to&apos;, prevent&apos;, accretions of food from&apos; without.&apos;, being used, to feed the German army and selected. elements in the- Gerir.33&apos;population, if not-directlythen indirectly by enabling other supplies to be diverted.Moreover, from a propagandist point of view, I believe thaito start on these experiments of letting food through theblockade and then to stop - and I am sure that before long weshould have to stop - would be much worse than never to startat all.6. Nor can we hope to keep the case of unoccupied Franceseparate from the more general case of the Enslaved Area.    the repercussions of any concession would be most formidable.    If wfrelax for the French, how can we refuse appeals for the bravePoles, or for the Norwegians, Dutch and Belgians, or - when we have been pushed that distance down the slope - for theinnocent German victims of Hitler&apos;s tyranny and our blockade?Nor can I see any quid pro quo for a concession by us tounoccupied. France.    Of course, if there were, somewhere in theFrench Overseas Empire, a Free French Government fighting a tour side, and if that Government were to ask that concessionsshould be made for Petain&apos;s France,  that would be a new situation to be reconsidered on its merits.    But we are notthere yet.7. I have argued that, on the facts, there will be no famineunless the Germans make it.    But, no doubt, throughout the-.Enslaved Area there will be.a shortage of food below habitualstandards and in particular a shortage of fats.    (Fats, however]are a most -dangerous import, since they can be made intoexplosives)    The populations will live on a depressing andmonotonous diet, well below the optima devised by scientists.Even so, incidentally, have many British unemployed and their families lived for many years.    The effect of this low diet inEurope will not be mass starvation, which would naturally revolfAmerican humanity, but a lessening of physical and mental energjja weakening of the will to go on fighting, a greater inclination!towards discontent and even violent revolt;    in short, a general)lowering of morale.    Do we or do we not desire this state ofthings?/^* &apos; fx&apos;&quot;   i. r     -   r&apos;&apos;   &apos;       - &quot;ft.&apos;;&apos;-&apos; f-r&apos;      ;&apos;r&apos;; ^ v . 1anoLvnot rB&apos;rlrti&apos;sh, - It&apos;mi gh-t b -! p6intedibu1i&apos;( to - those desirous ,... on vhumanecgrbunds, of&apos; feeding. Ife^t^i^&apos;&apos;!; that&apos; the &apos;f bodlfsuppi:.u3of Europe&quot; are0^subfetaniiialiy larger- per hfea^-of cpopU^^those of\ r,dia, Africa, Japan, China or probably Russia, alsothat somev&apos;mil.liqns of American citizens are undernourished^5. As regards &quot;unoccupied&quot; Prance, it is said that thepopulation of this area is largely swollen by refugees.    But why should not the Germans let these people go home?    It is alsoy/orth noting that, although H.M.G.  have decided to subject FrencNorth Africa to Contraband and Enemy Export control, we have not,in fact, the naval means to prevent traffic between French north africa and unoccupied France.    The North African harvest, nowgathered, can therefore pass freely across the Mediterranean.It is argued that, if we allow some food ships from america to pass Gibraltar and unload at Marseilles, we shall both win ticgood will of the French population and also be able to preventthe food being taken by the enemy.    I do not believe that either of these arguments is well based.    There is no free Press inunoccupied France, and no effective means of letting theseunhappy people know where their food comes from.    When recentlythree food ships were allowed by us to unload at Marseilles,the local Press boasted that they had &quot;escaped the Britishblockade&quot;.
things?   Surely the answer must &quot;be &quot;Yes&quot;, and our policy a.ecidedaccordingly.    Stubble will only burn easily after a dry spell.8. i think, however, that the time has come when a clearjglfclaration should be made by H.M.G.  that we are imposingthe blockade and imposing it firmly, solely with a view toshortening the war and diminishing the total sura of humanmisery which. Hitler will have caused.I propose that we should further declare that it is our intention not only to permit, but to arrange in advance for,the entry of food into any part of the Enslaved Area, when thispart at least has been wholly cleared of German forces and hasgenuinely regained its freedom.    Lot us declare that food shallgo in when, but only when. Hitler&apos;s hordes go out.    We must not,of course, be caught in any obvious trap, such as the pretended&quot;independence&quot; of Petain&apos;s France or of any other area, which,though nominally evacuated by the Germans, would remain in effectunder their control.    But if we could build up, best of all-Lif this country, large stocks of food, which could be advertisedboth to Hitler&apos;s victims and to American citizens, and perhap seven partly paid for by the latter, to be held in trust forthe Free Europe of to-morrow, such a provision might inspirea great propagandist and moral appeal, on both sides of the atlantic.I propose to my colleages that we should ask the PrimeMinister to make a declaration in this sense at an earlydate.e.d.7t.h August,  1940.Ministry of Economic Warfare
