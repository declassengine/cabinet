THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOMPENSATION FOR WAR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.FOLLOWING the announcement by the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons on the 5th September, I have reviewed, in conjunction with a smallexpert committee appointed for the purpose, the existing Government under-takings in regard to compensation for war damage to property, and I have examined the possibility in present circumstances of the inauguration of an insurance scheme.The policy of the Government has hitherto been that, after the war, whenthe extent of the damage was known, it would pay such compensation as our thenfinancial circumstances permitted. Those circumstances were to include boththe resources at our disposal and the claims upon them not only for the serviceof war pensions and of the much-increased national debt, but also for reconstruction in various directions. Reasonable as such a policy may have beenfrom a general point of view in the circumstances then contemplated, it may meanhardship in the case of many individual house-owners, in that, where a housecannot be repaired with the help of Government loans under the Housing(Emergency Powers) Act, an owner receives no assistance towards the cost of alternative accommodation. It has also been objected that property owners ingeneral are left uncertain as to the amount of compensation they will ultimatelyreceive.2. The problem of reconciling the interests of the general community, manyof whom will have suffered war losses in other ways, with those of the owners ofhouses and other property is not an easy one, and it is clear, I think, that, if thelatter are to be assured of full compensation for their losses, they must themselvessubstantially contribute towards the cost. A real insurance scheme, based onactuarial estimates of the risk of damage, is still impossible. The only practicablecourse is to exact contributions from the property owner, with assistance fromthe State in certain eventualities, on some basis which, while necessarily somewhatarbitrary owing to the absence of adequate data, will commend itself as generallyreasonable and in the interest not only of the owners but of the State itself.3. After examining a number of alternative schemes I have come to theconclusion that the one set out in the Appendix to this Memorandum will afford the most satisfactory solution of this difficult problem. The scheme has been considered by the Lord Presidents Committee, and to meetsuggestions made in that Committee (and also in my Consultative council at the Treasury) I have introduced the provisions described under (b) below, andin paragraph 5 of the Appendix, whereby payments on account of the property owners&apos; contributions will be collected during the war.Printed for the War Cabinet.  October 1940.secret copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 251.October 1, 1940.WAR CABINET.[21764]B
The main points in the scheme,1 so far as its affects immovable property (i.e.,buildings and fixed plant) are as follows :  (a) All&apos; persons interested in property-e.g&apos;., owner-occupiers, lessors and-,\ lessees, mortgagors and mortgagees-will receive full compensationfor war damage according to their respective interests.   Where the.&quot;      damage is total, the amount of compensation in respect of any,.; , property will be its pre-war value; in the case of partial damage, itwill be the  estimated  cost  of  repair.   This  provision will  be retrospective.(b) The funds to pay such compensation in respect of damage up to the31st August, 1941 (i.e., for the first two years of war) will be provided in the first place by a charge of 3 per cent, on the capital value of allproperty. If the proceeds of that charge are insufficient, the state will meet the deficiency up to an amount equal to the proceeds of the3 per cent. Any remaining balance of the deficiency will be met in. equal parts by the State and by a supplementary levy. If the 3 percent, is more than sufficient to cover the damage, the surplus willinure to the benefit of the property owners. The charge for any period after the 31st August, 1941, would be reviewed and considerednearer the time and appropriate provisions made.A charge of 3 per cent, is estimated to bring in a sum, say, ofrather over  200 millions. If the damage to August 1941 exceededthis figure, it would not be until it had reached an amount twice as great (i.e., at some point over  400 millions) that any further contri-bution would be called for from property owners.Owing to the impracticability of ascertaining the capital value,of all real property in the country speedily under war conditions, thecharge of 3 per cent, will in most cases be finally liquidated after thewar; though it will be collected in full during the war (i) in every case where a property changes hands for any reason, (ii) as a deduction from compensation paid, in all cases of war damage.   It has been represented to me that it would be desirable to make a beginning withcollecting payments in all cases during the war.   I agree that this isdesirable notwithstanding the hard circumstances of many property owners; the difficulty centres on finding a practical plan.   I am satisfied that it would be hopeless to set up entirely new machineryduring the war and we are limited to the use of some method of collection already to hand.   No entirely suitable machinery exists,but after considering all possible alternatives, I have reached the. conclusion that the least objectionable plan would be to use that forthe collection of Schedule A income tax.   In the majority of casesthis involves payment in the first place by the occupier, who thendeducts the tax from the rent he pays to his lessor.  An unsatisfactoryfeature of the Schedule A machinery for present purposes is that,while 13 million properties are assessed to Schedule A, the tax is notcollected in 5 million cases, because the persons concerned are notliable to tax, or are given tax allowances which would absorb any payment.   Nevertheless, if it is held that the admitted advantage ofmaking some collection at once outweighs the disadvantages of workinga difficult plan, I should propose that an extra 2s. in the   should be levied under Schedule A, doing the best that circumstances permit to make the collection effective.  A special plan will be needed to dealwith mines, docks and some other types of property not subject toSchedule A.   In theory such a tax should produce from  24 millions a year upwards, but in practice, owing to evacuation, loss of rents bylandlords and many other reasons which affect the yield of Schedule Ain war time, it is difficult to make precise estimates of what may be collected.   The collections under Schedule A would represent only aninstalment of the sums&apos; due under the 3 per cent, charge, and&quot;/ - 1   1,1;    particularly if the war extends beyond August 1941 a large part ofthe charge would remain to be collected at the close of hostilities.Property owners would then have the option of discharging theirliability, by a single payment, and where this is not done power wouldbe taken to collect the sums due over a short term of years.
An alternative scheme.would be to invite the persons whose property is made liable to the charge of 3: per cent, to liquidate the ,charge (in whole or in part) during the-war, and there is some reasonto think that many owners of property would respond to such an invitation. It may, not be physically possible to arrange for finalvaluations as the basis of the charge in all such cases, but it could nodoubt be arranged to accept payments on account on the basis of provisional valuations, subject to fin ah review as and when possible.Unlike the Schedule A scheme/this proposal is of a voluntary nature;it is quite impossible to estimate how much it would yield,(c) The time at which the compensation will be paid will require carefulconsideration in each individual case. It will be paid at once if itis in the public interest to rebuild or repair the property concerned and the necessary labour and material are available or if suitablealternative accommodation can be purchased. But rebuilding orrepair of a damaged property should also depend on how far propertymay be, required for the maintenance of essential services (e.g.,munitions, food production, export trade, housing and other civil. needs) and on the degree of priority to be accorded to it in theallocation of labour and materials. If payment of compensation isdeferred, interest at 2^ per cent, per annum will be payable in themeantime.It is proposed that such, important questions as the time atwhich, and conditions on which, rebuilding and repair should becarried out in individual cases shall be settled by a War DamageCommission, which I would propose to set up to supervise generally the operation of this new scheme and of other arrangements for compensating the victims of war damage. In deciding all such questions as the above the Commission would, of course, work in close touch with the Departments concerned (e.g., Ministry of Supply,Ministry of Food, Board of Trade).id) At the same time it must be recognised that where payment of compensa-tion is deferred the interim payment of interest will not, in manyoases, afford adequate relief to owners of small houses or smallbusiness premises. They will often be unable, even with such interimpayment, to meet the rent of new accommodation. Since the State isproviding a scheme to replace the assets which they have lost, it isdesirable that they should derive the fullest possible benefit when their need is greatest. It is therefore proposed that the War DamageCommission should have power to supplement the interest payment&apos; with advances (not exceeding  500 in all) on account of the compensa-tion ultimately payable where such assistance is necessary to enablean individual to carry on his business or to house himself and his family.The Commission would also be given similar discretion to make:   advances on account of the compensation due to any interested partyin cases where it proved necessary; an example would be that of amortgagee who has made advances on a property which has been demolished and who is in urgent need of cash to meet his liabilities.4. The definite provision of compensation given under the scheme willenable the relations of mortgagors and mortgagees of damaged property to be clarified and, where necessary, adjusted. At present, while a mortgagor isrelieved by law of his liability to repair damaged premises, his personal covenantto pay the interest on, and principal of, his debt remains, and that covenant maybe a source of much anxiety to him. The most important change proposed is that where the mortgagor cannot enjoy the use of the damaged premises, he shouldbe relieved of his liability to pay interest on his debt and be afforded, pendingpayment of the compensation, a moratorium on repayments of principal. Themortgagee will, however, receive from the State interest at *2\ per cent, on hisshare of the compensation, and that share will, when paid, pro tanto satisfy the mortgage debt.&apos;5.   I must point out that this scheme primarily relates to private, industrialaad commercial property from  whom  a considerable  contribution  can  be[21764] B 2
obtained. There still remains the question as to whether&apos; anything can be done for churches, hospitals, schools, museums, town halls, &amp;c., which have recentlysuffered considerably, and I am giving consideration as&apos;to how, if at all. these canbe dealt with.6. In the further examination of this scheme I have also come to theconclusion that some further provision is necessary to supplement the schemealready in existence for free compensation for loss of furniture, &amp;c, to persons with incomes below  400. I have in mind a scheme of voluntary insurance atspecial premiums for furniture and personal possessions which could be workedthrough the Fire Insurance Companies for persons above these income limits.7. I am endeavouring to work out a plan, similar to that applicable toimmovable property, to cover movable plant, machinery, &amp;c.8. Legislation will be necessary to carry out these proposals, and in orderthat it may be prepared I should be glad of the War Cabinefs approval of theproposals in principle. I propose, in order to obtain, if possible, general agree-ment, to consult the various parties and members in the House who are especiallyinterested in the subject. I must, in particular, be assured, as laid down by thePrime Minister in the House of Commons, that the condition he made that sucha scheme is confined to physical war damage is generally acceptable. The draftBill will in due course be submitted to the Home Policy Committee.K. W.Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, S. W. 1,October 1, 1940.APPENDIX.Draft Heads of Scheme for Immovable Property.ALL immovable property will be subject to a charge which will be provisionally fixed at 3 per cent, of the value of the property as at the31st March, 1939. If this charge does not cover the total compensation payable in respect of damage done up to the 31st August, 1941, the Treasury will contribute the excess cost of such compensation up to a sum equal to the total net proceeds of the charge. Should these combined amounts still not suffice tomeet all claims, then a further levy will be made of an amount equal to one-halfof the deficit and the Treasury will contribute the other half. If the provisionalcharge of 3 per cent, more than covers the total compensation for the period upto the 31st August, 1941, the surplus will either be repaid direct to those whohave paid the charge or be applied towards meeting the compensation payable inrespect of any damage after the 31st August, 1941. The amount of the charge to be levied in respect of such damage will be settled nearer the time.2. Subject to the provisions in paragraph 5 for payments on account, thecharge on any property will be finally payable at the following times :  (a) In the event of the property changing hands* immediately.(b) in the event of the property being damaged by deduction from thecompensation when it is paid; and(c) in other cases after the war and either by instalments spread over such period not exceeding 5 years as the Treasury may determine oroutright at any time at the option of the owner.3.   The charge will be payable by the following persons :  (a) in the case of freehold properties not subject to any lease or tenancyother than a short-term tenancy by the freeholder;[* Note : &quot; Changing hands &quot; includes (i) any transfer by way of sale or mortgage of the fee simple of land ; (ii) the grant of any lease of land for a term of seven or more years ;(iii) any transfer on sale of any such lease ; and (iv) any transfer on death.]
(b) in tfhe case of leasehold properties-by the lessor in receipt of the rackrent, subject to provision, in the case of a chain of leases, for passing-&apos;    on the charge to superior leasees.[Note.-Every holder of a lease with a remaining term of 40 years or more will be responsible for the payment of the whole charge.If the remaining term is under 40 years the charge will be dividedamong the interested parties according to fixed rules.](c) in the case of mortgaged properties by the mortgagors and mortgageesaccording to their respective interests in the properties as determinedby fixed rules.4. The valuation which is the basis of the charge will be made whenever theproperty changes hands* or on damage occurring or (in other cases) as and whenpracticable, by the Valuation Branch of the Inland Revenue.5. In the meantime, in order to secure some payments during the war onaccount of the charge, it is proposed to levy an additional income tax of 2s. inthe   under Schedule A on those persons who are at present assessed to tax under that Schedule and to regard the persons who pay the additional tax as havingpro tanto discharged their liability to the 3 per cent, charge on their properties.[As an alternative method to the above of securing some payments during thewar, those liable to pay any portion of the 3 per cent, charge might be invitedto liquidate their liability either in whole or in part during the war, either onthe basis of a final valuation or, where such a valuation is not possible, by a payment on account based on a provisional valuation and subject to final reviewlater.]6. Claims to compensation will be assessed (a) in the case of total damage on the basis of the market value of the property as at the 31st March, 1939,and (&amp;) in the case of partial damage on the basis of the estimated fair cost ofreinstatement at the earliest date at which repair becomes practicable andpermissible.Where there is more than one interest in a damaged property and the damage is total, the interested parties shall agree among themselves as to the division ofthe compensation; failing such agreement, the division shall be settled by theCompensation Board. When the damage is partial, the compensation shall be payable to the party carrying out the repairs.7. Compensation shall be payable equal to the amount of the assesseddamage in the following manner :  (a) In cases of total damage, payment of compensation will be made whenthe War Damage Commission, after consulting the appropriated departments, are satisfied that it is in the public interest to make it.The Commission would be entitled to attach conditions to any payments made, e.g., as to expending it in rebuilding in situ or in. aparticular locality or in purchasing alternative accommodation.(b) In cases of partial damage, payment of compensation shall only be madeas and when the repairs are actually effected.(c) Under both (a) and (b) interest at the rate of 2\ per cent, per annumshall be payable on the compensation money for the period between thedate of the damage and the date of payment of compensation.(d) Where the Commission is satisfied that, in addition to the payment ofinteiest under (c) above, a claimant needs assistance to enable himto meet the rent of alternative accommodation or to restore hiseconomic activity, it will have discretion to make advances from timeto time (not exceeding  500 in all) on account of the compensationultimately payable to him. The Commission will also have discretion to make similar advances to any interested party where it is necessarysuch as to mortgagees who need assistance in meeting their obligations.* See note on page 4.
8. Where a property is mortgaged, special provision will be necessary todeal with the contract between the mortgagor and mortgagee. (At present, whilethe mortgagor is relieved of his liability to repair the damaged premises, his personal covenant to pay interest on and principal of his debt remains.) Thefollowing provisions are suggested :  (a) Where the property is, by reason of the damage, not habitable and cannotbe or is not rendered habitable, the mortgagor should cease to be liable for interest on his debt. He would at the same time be given thebenefit of a moratorium on any repayments of principal which falldue. The mortgagee will receive interest oh his share of thecompensation until it is paid, and that share, when paid, willpro tanto satisfy the mortgage debt.(b) Where the property is not immediately habitable but is repaired so asto be habitable, or where the property remains habitable and repairsare carried out, the repairs should in each case be carried out by themortgagor, who will receive the appropriate cash payment. He willcontinue to be liable for the interest on and principal of his debt as before the damage. The mortgagee will in those cases receive noshare of the compensation.(c, Where the property remains habitable but repairs are not carried out,the mortgagor will remain liable for the interest on and principal ofhis debt, and he should receive the interest during the war on bothhis own and the mortgagee^ share of the compensation. The repairsshould ultimately be carried out by the mortgagor, who should thenreceive the whole of the compensation, his original liabilities to themortgagee remaining unaltered.(d) Further legislation may be necessary after the war to say how farmortgagor and mortgagee shall share losses due, e.g., to the differenceunder (a) between the total mortgage debt and the compensationreceived by the mortgagee and that under (b) and (c) between thecost of the repairs carried out by the mortgagor and the compensationreceived by him.9. Special arrangements may have to be made for property owned byreligious and educational bodies, Local Authorities, &amp;c.10. Legislation will be necessary immediately to impose the proposed charge on property (including the valuation on which it will be based) and anycompulsory payment on account, to provide for the apportionment and payment ofthe compensation, and to cover the proposals in paragraph 7 (a) to (c), aboutmortgages.
