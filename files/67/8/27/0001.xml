It was then decided that theprices authorised were to apply only to this year&apos;s harvest and to livestock marketedfin the three months following the Committee5 s decision;   and that the (kJvernmentiwould retain a free hand to revise these prices ilupwards or downwards&quot; for theBlivest of 1940-41.3. The Lord President&apos;s Committee also decided that one of the principleslupon which the revision for 1940-41 should &quot;be based was that the price of livestock-should &quot;be so adjusted as to give agriculturists an incentive to avoid any appreciablediminution in the output of milk, while the production of fat cattlehand.sheepshould &quot;be maintained so far as this was consistent with the maintenance of milk production,,40 The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries now urges that while the priceifor milk and potatoes may be increased, the price of fat cattle should not &quot;be decreased.In other words, revisions may be upwards but not downwards, which is contrary to thedecision of the Lord President&apos;s Committee, and contrary to the public announcement which was made following that decision,,     The Treasury and the Ministry of Food areof opinion that the price authorised last June for fat cattle is excessive, and they-.are of opinion that if the price that is now in operation (which Is above thelevel of June last) were reduced to Q% above June last it would still be a satisfactoryiaad remunerative price for the farming industry,     If the llg$ increase is tocontinue it will mean an additional and unnecessary subsidy from the taxpayer ofmm millions per annum.The memorandum of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries appears to meexaggerate the effect of the reduction in cattle prices which the Minister ofI considers necessary.     At this time of the year prices always fall.   In spite oti the lowest point on the new scale, if the Minister of Food&apos;s proposal were)ted, would still leave farmers who have grass-fed cattle to sell with a Prlceper live hundredweight more than they expected when they purchased or reared the[e cattle which they are now fattening.     They have had to &quot;bear little or no ^-eased oost on these animals due to the rise in wages which came into effect innor have they incurred any substantial increase in their costs due to the rise&quot;eedingstuff. prices.     Moreover they are mainly the same farmers who, during[ and August, have been receiving a windfall increase of about 5/- to 9/- per cwt.There is another reason why the Ministry of Food considers that cattleies should be reduced.     The Lord presidents Committee, as explained above, gavef priority to milk production.   Milk Production is, however, being reduced.   Thepifio pood Committee share the view of the Ministry of Food that so long asjes for fat oattle are out of line with the price of milk it will not be practicable
to prevent a further fall in milk production.     From the point of view of thenational health the production p% milk is of greater importance than theproduction of beef, of which ample imports can be obtained from overseas.Milk products, on the other, hand, owing to the occupation of Denmark and holland by Germany, must remain ijin short supply for the remainder of the war.7,     To sum. up, the Minister pf:Fpodsees no necessity for maintaining cattleprices at their present high Ipt^eXj which was only sanctioned as a temporary measure,,     He considers that to dp so would not only result in the unnecessaryexpenditure of money by the Exchequer, but would definitely prejudice themaintenance of milk production which should be the first aim of.; our foodproduction policy 0(Intld.)
