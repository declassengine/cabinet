REGRET.w.p. (G. ) 0+0)231;T1ST AUGUST e  191+0.copy m.oSWAP. CABINET.THE MANUFACTURE OP AIRCRAFT IN INDIA.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister without Portfolio.The proposal to manufacture aircraft in India and todevelop the resources of the Empire outlined in the memorandum circulated &quot;by the Secretary of State for India (W.P. (G. ) (1+0) 219)must he judged by the criteria:-(a) whether the scheme advanced is the best that can be designed;(b) whether it is likely to have severe adverse effects upon aircraft production in this country or for import into this country.2. Both the Government of India and the Secretary ofState for India are satisfied that the scheme and the types of aircraft that it is intended to produce are suitable to the    Ineeds of India.     The scheme is necessarily a compromise betwdthe objective of    securing the greatest possible development cIndian resources and that of obtaining the most rapid possiblydelivery of aircraft.      If time were not of the essence of theproblem,  it might conceivably have been desirable to have givenpreference to an alternative project put forward by the Tatainterests, which would have relied to a greater extent on indian resources.      But, since both the real needs of thesituation and considerations of political and psychologicalexpediency require rapid results, it has been thought best to rely on the project put forward by Mr. Pawley.      It is partof his scheme progressively to make more and more use of Indianresources, and to depend less and less upon imported parts and non-Indian technical assistants.3. There is no doubt that Mr. Pawley has shown a remarkable ability to produce aircraft under difficult conditions in China.      One of the fighters   built at Loiwinghas recently been inspected in Rangoon by the Director of CivilIndia, and he was satisfied as to Its constructionThe experience that Mr. Pawley has gained in thesimilar in outlookAviation in and design.manufacture of aircraft with labour broadlyand capacity to that which can be recruitedan extremely valuable asset to the scheme;certainly give him a considerable advantage which the work can be put in hand and in thein India, will beit will almostin the speed withavoidance of the initial mistakes and delays which are normally encountered in introducing a new industry into such a country as India.

da4o The scheme mustc then,, be judged largely by itsrepercussions upon our own output or upon that of theUnited States for delivery to us,     While the Minister of aircraft Production has not expressed in detail hisobjections to the scheme., it is understood that they arise from a conviction that there will be serious repercussionsupon deliveries of aircraft to this country from UnitedStates sourcese      It is important, therefore, to examinethe^methods that would probably be employed by Mr, Pawley.It is fair also to bear in mind how small in the aggregatewould be the demand of India on the United States inrelation to the vast orders placed by the Ministry of aircraft Production,;      The number of aircraft to be delivered under the Government of India1&apos;?, scheme averageonly about 7 per month for the eighteen months over whichdeliveries   are expected to take place.5. Ere Pawley would, it is understood;, propose to start by building aircraft from parts imported in partly manu-factured form into IndiaD      Thus, so far as it may be truethat extended aluminium sections or the preliminaryfabrication of aircraft parts form an important limiting factor to the total output of the United States, he will beat least in partial competition with our demands and those for the United States rearmament programme.,      If Mr. Pawleyproposes only to manufacture aircraft frames and to fit tothem engines purchased complete in the United States, hewill necessarily be in competition with our own demands andthose of the United States programme.:      If, on the otherhand, Mre Pawley imports unmachined engine parts from theUnited States for completion in India, there still remains the possibility that his demands for engine parts, and forthe particular types of alloy steel required, some of whichare in short supply, will conflict with the demands of theMinistry of Aircraft Production;6c To some extent it will be necessary for Mr, Pawleyto depend upon imports of machine tools from the UnitedStatesp but he is confident that, with the assistance of his associates in the United States, he can obtain rapiddelivery,,      There has however, been some discussion of thepossibilities of moving equipment from Loiwing, and Mr.Pawley is further believed to have some control over certainequipment that has been lying for some time past at Rangoon.To the extent that either of these courses is possible, hewill be making available to meet British and Empire needs,resources which would not otherwise have been open to us.7. As regards materials, Mr.- Pawley will probably need to depend in the initial stages upon imported semi-manufactured partse      But it is hoped by degrees to dependmore and more on local supplies.      The Aluminium ProductionCompany at its works near Calcutta hopes to begin rollingaluminium from imported ingots by about December 1940,  to bein a position to utilise a plant now under construction toproduce aluminium from imported alumina sometime during1941P and at some later time., probably within three or fouryears? to refine locally mined bauxite0      The company hasalready made arrangements for the supply of alumina.      Forthe special steels required it would also appear likely that Mrc Pawley will depend initially upon United Statessources.      But&quot; the Tata works possesses the equipment and scientific staff necessary for their production, and there

is no reason why some or all of the necessary supplies shou!4lnot he obtained from India sources-8, It is evident, therefore, that the Government ofIndia&apos;s proposals-cannot be wholly without repercussionsupon the supplies which the Ministry of Aircraft Productionmay be hoping to obtain from the United States.     But that does not in itself necessarily condemn it.      If, as isargued in the memorandum of the Secretary of State for India,India&apos;s air defences are perilously weak, the projectadvanced will strengthen them with a considerably lesscurtailment of our own programme than would be involved by meeting the Same needs from our own production or fromthat of the United States for our usey. Thus the issue that requires decision is whether ornot broad strategic considerations (including the politicaland psychological effects upon Indian opinion) justify a strengthening of Indian air defences at a cost of somepossible interference with the deliveries of aircraft to thiscountry,,     That interference is likely to be small inrelation to the projected total output of aircraft in thiscountry and the United States.     The scheme proposed willhave the effect of developing our resources in a part of theEmpire far less vulnerable to air attack, and will diminish the extent to which the security of India and the Par Eastis dependent upon the maintenance of communications withthis country,,     I feel, therefore, that on balance it wouldbe advisable to proceed with this scheme.(Intld.)     A.GCTreasury Chambers, S.W.1,51ST AUGUST, 1940.
