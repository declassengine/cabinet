COPY HO.-      &quot;__21st December 194Q.-&apos; WAR    CABINET.THE ROYAL MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE FOR CIVILIANS.Memorandum by the Minister of Hone Security,1. I think I should bring to the attention of the Vvar Cabinetsone of the difficulties in working out a practicable scheme for .sending a Royal Message of Condolence to the next of kin of allcivilians killed by enemy action.2. This subject came, before the Committee on the Grant of Honoursin Time of War, in&apos; September, 1940.      They.-reported that theextension of the Royal Message to the next of kin of all civilianskilled as a result of ;enemy action might reduce the value of the message which was already being sent.to the relatives of thosekilled in the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Merchant Navy, and thatthey would have preferred a more limited extension.      On the factsbefore then the Committee came, however, to the conclusion that, if desired.,&apos; % fairly satisfactory scheme for civilians could be devised under which the Registrar-General would despatch the message to the next of kin as disclosed in the information given on registration of death.3. On this Report, the- War Cabinet recommended on the 25th September(W.M,:(40) 244 .Conclusion. 4) that the Royal Message should be sentto the next of kin of&apos; all civilians, killed by enemy action.     TheKing approved the recommendation and the text of the message,which was to be sent on Home Office (or Scottish Office)notepaper, was as follows:-&quot;The.Home Secretary (or Secretary of State for Scotland)is commanded by the King to assure you of Their Majesties&apos;heartfelt sympathy with you in your sorrow&quot;.4. In the course of designing a workable scheme,  so many difficulties have&apos;been revealed that it seems desirable to havethe matter considered again.      The&apos; main difficulty arises Inregard to the means of ascertaining the next of kin.     Deathsdue&apos;to war operations may be registered, either (a) in theordinary way by relatives or other persons having knowledge of thefacts or (b) under Defence Regulation 30 by the Clerk to the LocalAuthority, or. by .Officers in charge of Service Establishments.In either case, but more particularly &apos;ih case (b), it may be verydifficult, and&apos; in- many cases impossible, to ascertain the next ofkin of the deceased...     In case (a), the informant would usually bea relative, but not necessarily the nearest relative.     There isno legal requirement on the&apos; informant to supply particulars of the
next of kin,.&apos;..ey.en. if known, and although the -Registrar nightask for such particulars, It does not necessarily follow thatthe information so obtained would be&apos;reliable.      In case (b)the Clerk to the Local Authority is dependent for hisparticulars on such.information as the mortuary superintendentnay be able to obtain from the person identifying the body.The latter may be, &apos; and no doubt frequently.. i s, .-the - next ofkin, in which cose no difficulties will arise.   , Oh the otherIpand,; particularly where several members, of one family -become casualties---together,;&apos;the business of&apos; Identifying the body and seeing to the disposal of the effects nay be carriedout by a neighbour or other, person having very little-- knowledgeof the deceased&apos;s family affairs.   .. ., ;a-o p&apos;:::.&apos;e:  &quot;&apos; :-5. It fellows from the above..that there&apos;&apos;would be delays whilethe Local Authority endeavoured to ascertain the. next of kinand there is: no doubt - that unavoidable mistakes would be madein issuing the Royal Message. -   The Message might be addressedto the wrong per son, - or&apos;; to a deceased person; . of it might bewrongly addressed-.    &apos; In a great many cases no message couldbe sent out because particulars were not&apos; available.     Errorsand omissions would, cause great distress to bereaved&apos; persons,and they would be attributed to.official Inefficiency andcallousness.      It is fearea that.the mistakes might be sofrequent as to bring the whole procedure.into disrepute.6. Other difficulties are not of the same order of importance,but perhaps deserve mention.      Is the procedure-to&apos; applyretrospectively b.. provide for the sending:.: of -messages tothe next of -kin of the&quot; 20,000 or . so. civilians who have alreadybeen killed by enemy action?     Should&apos; aliens, be -included,since nationality is not normally required on registration of death?     Are members of the Fighting Services killed off duty to receive the message-?-    Must&apos; special machinery be devised for deaths occurring outside territorial waters which.are notrequired to be registered v/ith the. Registrar of Deaths?7-  It appears therefore that if the decision of the25th September is to&apos; be implemented, an elaborate organisation will be required, arid even sodelays, mistakes, omissions, andother distressing occurrences will be inevitable.     Moreover,State Departments and local authorities are working at very high pressure.      In my view we should consider whether asubmission should not.be made to His Majesty, pointing outthe difficulties in the. way of sending the Royal Message to civilians, and suggesting that it should be abandoned.8. At the same time, I would make the following proposals foran alternative form of recognition which would no doubt be acceptable to relatives of air raid casualties:-(i)  the keeping of careful records by the- RegistrarGeneral of all civilian deaths due to enemy action,and of deaths among civil defence workers on duty,so that books of remembrance or rolls of honour can,if necessary, be compiled after the war is over.
(ii) appropriate steps to be taken to encourage,so far as practicable, the keeping ofrecords of the graves of war victims,, theproper care of - graves,. the erection ofmemorials in cemeteries, etc.(iii) consideration to be given to the practicability of the publication by local authorities, ifthey so desire, of monthly lists of casualties among civil defence personnel, showing, deathsand admissions to hospitals.H.M.MINISTRY OF HOME SECURITY
