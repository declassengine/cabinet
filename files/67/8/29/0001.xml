Topham,Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Office.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had been invited bythe War Cabinet at its meeting the previous day &quot;to enquire,-inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, into the adequacy ofthe measures now being taken for the relief of distress, the accommodation of persons rendered homeless, and the repair of  .damage caused by air-braids.&quot; . .--THE MINISTER OF HEALTH described the steps which, were taken in cases where persons were rendered homeless.    There were three stages.    In the first place the householders were conductedto centres which had been specially prepared for this purpose in suitable buildings in the locality..   This part of the system was -on the whole working well.    The arrangements for sleeping were not entirely satisfactory, and these were to be improved.    Secondly,usually the next day, the householders would either go to^relafcivesor friends, or would be put up in households in the district.People were responding generously in taking in homeless people,hut more could he- 4one in this direction.    It had been suggestedthat lists should.be compiled of householders, who would be willing to billet persons for the critical two or three days ofthis second stage.
The third stage was the more permanent arrangement and the real problem here was in the case of persons whosehouses were completely destroyed or not worth repairing.The proportion of these houses was in fact very small.MR. GEORGE (Ministry of Health) estimated that it was only8 per cent, of the houses damaged (excluding those in whichglass only was broken);    on a subsequent estimate he put the figure at 5 per cent.      Nearly all the repairable houses were made habitable within 48 hours.      The procedure in thecases where houses were not worth repairing was that the localAuthority put a number; of occupants into Council house while others found their own.accommodation.      There remained a   -number of people who.could not,house themselves and in thecase of these., the local Authorities exercised their powerto requisition empty houses.      The above had up to datedealt adequately with the situation.      If it were to fail to do so, the only satisfactory, course.-would be to put up new buildings.    Here, of course, there would be thedifficulty of materials, and of time, and the problem wouldhave to   be solved by crowding up and&apos;perhaps removal toother areas of persons not required -in the area for essential work.A das cussion ensued in which&quot; the following points were made:-(i) There was at present no shortage of glass.Contractors, Local Authorities, and theGovernment itself, all had large stores,  theOffice of Warks having 82 depots throughout the country with about 1,000,000 square feet of glass. - * :Arrangements were also made for ample supplies&quot; of substitute material.(ii) Stocks of tiles were also good.     Many tiles weresalvaged from houses which were found to be not worth repairing.(iii) While there-were a number of empty houses ins&quot;evacuation&quot; areas, there might eventually be difficulty in accommodating people in .&quot;reception&quot;-areas.-  - (iv) Local Authorities would &quot;ordinarily operate only within their own boundaries.    If collaborationwere to be needed between adjoining localAuthorities, the Regional representatives might      .be able to assist in procuring this.MR. REID (Assistance Board) then gave a description of the scheme whereby advances in respect of war damage tohousehold furniture or personal clothing were made to certainindividuals on account of (and to be deducted from) anycompensation payable to them after the war, and said that thescheme was working smoothly.    To qualify for advances underthe scheme, the gross income of the claimant was not in the caseof furniture, to exceed  400 a year ory in the case of clothing 400 a year if he had dependants, or - 250 a year if he had nodependants.     The scheme contemplated three types of payment,first an immediate payment cOuld be made with a maximum of 15 for furniture and a further  15 for clothing.   .( 10 inthe case of clothing where the claimant had no dependants).Secondly, there were intermediate payments after the.InlandRevenue had assessed the damage, with-a maximum of -  50in the case of furniture, and, in the case of personal clothing:&quot;(1)  10 to a person without dependants;(2)  20 to a person with one dependant if the.clothing of the claimant and the claimani? s      - 1dependant was lost or damaged;(3)  30 to a person with more than onedependant if the clothing of the claimantand tv/o or more dependants was lost or damaged.
The third ,type of payment was. the daf erred..payment- made after the war.It was pointed out that the.. scheme at present onlyapplied to household furniture and would not cover tools.MR, MATTHEWS (Assistance Board) said that theywere highly satisfied with the working of the scheme.There had not been a single complaint at Croydon,,SHE LORD PRIVY SEAL mentioned a particular point which had been raised in the Cabinet, namely, theprovision of. floors for Anderson shelters, either inbrick or some other material,,THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, Ministry of home security, said that provision had been made for theprovision of flooring where shelters were in an area wherethere was a danger of flooding,,     The Local authorities were empowered to provide brick or concrete floors, andit was made clear that expenditure in this respect wouldrank for granto     There had been no such instruction withregard to shelters generally,  and shortage of materials would stand in the way of any such instruction.      In somecases, Anderson shelters had been removed,  and brickshelters put up in their places?SIR THOMAS GARDINER (Ministry of Home Security)mentioned that some of the new shelters erected since last year had been put up rather hurriedly and had notbeen tested in the same way as those which were therelast winter.As regards the provision of shelters in the country generally, the Parlaimentary Secretary said that, withthe exception of the North Western area,  it was fair tosay that in many areas the provision of shelters was reasonably up to the intended standards      They badly needed more materialscMR. OSMOND,  (Ministry ,of Home Security) said th\atin the North Eastern region, the local authorities hadbeen circularised and a considerable amount of detailed examination of shelters, had taken place.     A high proportion had been scheduled for concreting.MR. ROSE (Scottish Office) said that theinformation given about England applied also to Scotland.He had been unable in the time available to obtain detailed figures but his understanding was that it had been foundpracticable to cope with these problems in Scotland.      Ifdamage occurred on a more extensive scale, the general shortage of house*s in Scotland might create a difficultyin finding accommodation for persons; displaced..Mft0 REID mentioned the need for more voluntaryhelp in evacuation areas in connection with the care ofhouseholders, pending getting them settled in their newhomes.     There was, for obvious reasons,  a shortage of voluntary help in the evacuation areas.     The Ministerof Health undertook to enquire into the question whetherthe Women1 s Voluntary Service had mobile units which could afford the kind of assistance required.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.29TH AUGUST,  191+0.
