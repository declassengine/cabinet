MEMBERS OP THE HOUSE OP COMMONS.I thank you for the provision you have made towards-the increasingly heavy costs of war.    The readiness ofMy people to accept these burdens confirms Me in My belief that they will think no financial sacrifice too great toensure the triumph of our cause,MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OP THE HOUSE OP COMMONS.I am glad that despite the heavy preoccupations ofthe war My Government have found it possible to promotevarious measures for improving social conditions in thiscountry.The frustration of German plans for the invasion .of Britain,the attacks upon the sources of German military power, the firm defence of Egypt and the Sudan and the successful attack upon the Italian Navy give proof of our strength, and justify our confidence in final victory.The present war is not only a struggle between nations.It springs from the clash of fundamental ideals.    We shall notfalter or lay aside our arms until the high   purposes, to whichwe have pledged our faith, are achieved.I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labourso
