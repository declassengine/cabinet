Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.The office of Agent to the Government of India in SouthAfrica was established in 1927 for the ourpose of co-operating with the Union Government in regard to problems arising from the presence of a large Indian population inthat country.    The appointment has proved a success, and the agent (or Agent-General, as he is called) who acts on instructions from the Government of India has been in effect the latter&apos;s representative with the Union Government inregard to these matters.The Government of India have now proposed in the telegram of which a copy is attached that the status anddesignation of this appointment should be changed into thoseof a High Commissioner.   They state that General Smuts hasbeen informally consulted and is entirely in favour of theproposal on conditions which the Government of India are ready to accept.   The Government of India deal direct withthe Union Government on a number of matters, including trade questions; and an Indian High Commissioner would be the solechannel of communication between the Government of India andthe Government of the Union in all such matters, exceptquestions of war supplies on which the Government of India&apos;supply Department would correspond direct with the SouthAfrican authorities.The proposal does not involve any very great change,since the most important questions with which the HighCommissioner would have to deal are those which are alreadyhandled by the Agent-General, but it does offer certainpractical advantages - for example by increasing the prestige in the Union of the Government of India&apos;representative and also by providing a channel for thediscussion of trade questions without the necessity of having to appoint a seoarate trade commissioner.   In so faras it may be regarded as marking India1s advancing statuswithin the British Commonwealth it should have a goodpolitical effect in India as well as upon her inter-imperial relations.For these reasons I feel that it would be very desirableio accept the Government of India&apos;s proposals, and, if theoaomet approve, I would propose to do so and authorise themproceed with the necessary arrangements in directcorrespondence with the Union Government.^QtlL October 1940.L.S.A.secret.P.(G)(40) 258 WAR CABINET Copy No. &amp;10th October&apos;1940 INDIAPROPOSED CONVERSION OP POST OP aGSNT-GENERAL TO THEGOVERNMENT OP INDIA IN SOUTH AFRICA TO THAT OP AHIGH COMMISSIONER

TELEGRAM FROM GOVERNMENT OP INDIA, DEPARTMENT OFEDUCATION, HEALTH AND LANDS TO SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR INDIA DaTED 20th SEPTEMBER 1940.36o5Fait owing the appointment oT Canadian HighCommissioner in the Union of South Africa, question of changing status and designation of our Agent General tothat of High Commissioner has been engaging our attentionAgent General consulted informally General Smuts who is entirely in favour of the change.   Functions proposed bySmuts for High Commissioner which appear to us to be entirely suitable are as follows:&quot;(a) the incumbent of post would be the representativeof the Government of India and it would not be appropriate for him to act as spokesman of Indian community in Union,as Indian Agent-General has done.(b) As representative of Government of India it wouldbe appropriate for him to make   representations to UnionGovernment on matters of common interest to his government -ment and to Government of Union.   Such representationswould however only be made on instructions from hisGovernment, and not at instance of Indian community inUn ion.(c) The High Commissioner would not enter directlyinto discussions, as Agent-General has done, withsubordinate authorities, such as Provincial administratively-ions,   He would only tave up matters with Union Govern-ment, which might however in certain cases find itnecessary to arrange for a discussion to ta1re place between him and one or other of such subordinateauthorities&quot;.In view of growing disunity among Indians in SouthAfrica (a) would relieve our Representative in Union of embarrassment of identifying himself with any particulargroup though he would still maintain contact with allIndian leaders who may be willing to use him as a channel of representation to Government of India; (b) in effectrepresents present position as on all questions of import-ance Agent acts on our instructions after prior consulation with us; (c) would not affect his effective-ness in dealing with matters of provincial importance aseven now he depends for success of his intervention on good offices of Union Government.   Finally proposed change will have excellent political&apos;effect in thiscountry as raising India&apos;s international status.Z-     Informal understanding has also been given to UnionGovernment that in the event of proposal being accepted, -Indian High Commissioner, live British High commissioner and Canadian High Commissioner, will be sole channel ofcommunication between Government of India and Governmentof Union in all matters including trade.    Exception will however be made regarding war supplies; necessity for urgent communication ma^es it desirable that supply department should correspond direct with South Africanauthorities.   This procedure will not involve anyinconvenience.We therefore strongly favour change and hope thatyou will approve.    If you do so formal consent of UnionGovernment will be secured by us.   No change inemoluments of post is contemplated.
