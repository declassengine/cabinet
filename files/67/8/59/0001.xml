THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOV-ggjMiJNJJ.SECRET.W.P,  (C)X40 )-259^ICth October, 1940.WAR   CABINET.THE   MEANS   TEST.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.Y/hen considering the proposals recently approved by the Cabinet for anincrease in the unemployment assistance scales, I became convinced that mereadjustments of these figures will not solve the problem and that something more drastic is necessary.     The question is certain to be raised inParliament in the near future when the amended Assistance Regulations come upfor approval.The household means test has always been greatly disliked by workingpeople.     The feeling of irritation has in recent weeks been increased owingto the movements of population and consequent dislocation of family life.The extension of the means test to old age pensioners has greatly widened thefield of its application and has created new sources of criticism anddiscontent.The alternative which we ought to consider is a personal means test,limited as closely as may be to the personal needs and resources of theapplicant and those who are definitely dependent upon him^     Such a test wouldrequire careful definition but I have made some preliminary inquiries whichlead me to believe that it is possible to construct and adrninister a personalmeans test in such a way as to meet all the legitimate objections to thepresent household, means test.If my colleagues agree, I propose that we should at once have thedetails of a personal means test such as I have described worked out by a departmental Committee and brought up as soon as may be for consideration bythe Cabinet.     I should mention that the means test applies to supplementaryold age and blind persons pensions as well as to unemployment assistance andthat the cases under the former head are about five-sixths of the total in number and rather more than two-thirds in cost.I ask also for authority to say -in the House of Commons, when the newAssistance Regulations come up for approval there, that the whole question ofthe household means test is under- examination by the Government-COPY NO.    h, U(Initd.)   E.B.10th October, 1940.H.Q.228-75 J.J.
