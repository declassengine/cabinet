g DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SAE C R B TcW.P.(G)(40)250.-28TH AUGUST,  1940,COPY NO.  &apos;-5 -JWAR CABINET&apos;.EFFECT OP BOMBINGS AND AIR RAID WARNINGS on production,Memorandum &quot;by the Minister without Portfolio.In my paper W,P,(G)(40)172 of the 3rd July I outlined the effect up to that date of air raid warnings and bombings on production,      I now submit this further report covering theperiod 1st July to 19th August,.     (Since then there have been further severe bombings),There have beer, some heavy attacks during the sevenweeks under review, but the effect of damage on the programme Jproduction has been slight, though regrettable.There has, of course, been some loss of time due both to actual raids and to alarms.      This loss is difficult to assess,but it has certainly not been serious,      The Admiralty and theMinistry of Aircraft Production put it at probably not greaterthan In Royal Ordnance Factories the Ministry of Supplyput it at less than l-g$ and in Filling Factories less than 3$on the average.      In Ministry of Supply contractors&apos; factories,except where there has been actual loss of capacity due to damage, the estimates of loss of time vary from 6% to 7% upto a maximum of 15$,I attach the following Appendices:-Appendix A - Damage toIIIAircraft FactoriesDockyards and Principal ShoreEstablishments.III ShipyardsIV Admiralty Contractors&apos; WorksV Ministry of Supply Contractors&apos;Works,Appendix BAppendix Ccment by the Admiralty.- Statement by the Ministry of Supply as regardsRoyal Ordnance Factories,I think it will be agreed that the effects of enemy action upon production during this period have been much lessthan might have been expected.      It is a safe assumption thatthe new warning system adopted early in July saves considerable time in the factories, but some reports mention the danger ofthe warning tending to come too late and of bombs falling withoutany warning.., The morale of the workers appears to be high,  and Ithink the way in wmch difficulties have been overcome and production restored after damage has been suffered reflectsgreat credit upon all concerned and gives ground forconfidence in the future.SwyAT9hamDers^ S.W..1., (Intd. ) A.G.8TH AUGUST . 1^40,

The aircraftcomponent work is now in production at a new factory at Melton Mowbray.    notwithstanding the destructive effect it was possible toretrieve a number of jigs and parts and theloss of production can be estimated at notmore than 30 sets of Oxford fuselage sides,floors3 front doors and gun turret mountings.Factory badly damaged. The jigs on one sidewere not destroyed and have been recovered.Work is already proceeding at a new locationand full production will be going within six weeks of damage.

APPENDIX B.Statement., by Admiralty.General.Attack on coastal areas has been severe, hut theeffect of damage on the programme has teen negligible.Loss of time is difficult to estimate, but its effect would appear to be a loss of production probably not greaterthan 5 per cent.The effect on morale is not serious in most areas, butthere is a tendency to enhanced fatigue which may increase.The new warning system saves considerable production-time, butthere is serious risk to morale if the &quot;red&quot; warning tends tocome too late.     Visible active defence greatly braces morale.Voluntary A.R.P. workers are usually the best type oflabour and frequently key men.     The effect of this fact on production during air-raids will need to be watched.Dockyards and Principal. Naval rSAore Establishments,xDAMAGE.Damage to Dockyards has had little if any effect on work except at Portland and Portsmouth.      At the latter thecompletion dates of H.M. Ships have been put back 2-7 days.There has been no damage at Greenock (R.N. Torpedo Factory) orHolton Heath (R.N, Cordite Factory).TIME LOST.Loss of time was nil at Rosyth.      At other dockyardsit averaged about 2 hours a week,      At Devonport the effect was negligible, as it was made up by working overtime.     There was noloss of time at Greenock..     Loss of time at Holton Heathaveraged 3 hours a week, with slightly greater effect on production than the figure suggests.SUMMARY.Damage effect nil except at Portland and Portsmouth.Time lost unimportant,II.Naval CpnstvuctoLon, Merchant ShipbuiIding and Repairs.xDAMAGE.Six shipyards were damaged during the period underreview.      in most cases the damage was slight and production was hardly affected.      In only one case (Hall Russell of Aberdeen)has evidence been received of retardation of programme(Corvettes).x For details of     damage see Appendix A.-k-

LOSS OF TIME.In most cases reports are only available for the lasttwo weeks.      In general, loss of time owing to raids seems toaverage about 3\ hours a week at present;   but it would appearto be heavier in the important area -of the Tyne.Absenteeism after raids and night alarms is at mostports negligible;   but according to reports from centres whereraiding has boon severe, it would seem that the effect of raidsmay be reflected in enhanced fatiguej, in a tendency to stand aboutand discuss the raid, and in unwillingness to work in exposedpositions.summary;.! Neither damage nor loss of time have as yet had anyserious effect on the programme.III.Admiralty contractors works other than Shipyards.DAMAGE?Of the 1,500 main Admiralty contractors, excludingshipyards, only three were damaged by air attack in the period under review, all of minor importance to the Naval Programme.In only one case was production interrupted for a few days.LOSS OF TIME.In the Clyde and Scotland generally loss of time is atpresent negligible.      A careful   survey spread over the NorthWestern Area gives an average of half an   hour per week.     estimates of loss in the Tyne area range from 2.\ hours per week to 10 hours(night work).      In London (where a quarter of the leadingAdmiralty contractors are concentrated), loss of time has beenslight.     There is insufficient evidence from Birmingham to forman estimate.    In Cardiff there has been a 10 per cent, loss ofproduction;   but this is not a very important area from theAdmiralty point of view.     The Department of Torpedoes and Miningreports a loss of production among their contractors in all partsof the country of 3 to 5 per cent.SUMMARY.Damage is negligible.     Loss of time, though appreciable,has as yet had hardly any noticeable effect on supply.For details of damage see Appendix A.

Greater interference hasbeen experienced in the Filling Factories, some of whichstop work On the yellow warning, than in the engineering and Explosives Factories, but even so the loss in outputhas been small.
