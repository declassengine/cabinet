(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 07 HIS BRITANNIC KaJSSTY1 3GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(G)(40) 237,WAR CABINET14th September 1940.INDIA AND THE WAR;ATTITUDE OF CONGRESSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate to the war Cabinet three telegrams in whichthe Government of India indicate that the Congress may comeinto open conflict with them in the next few days.    They asvauthority in that event to tave immediate and comprehensiveaction against the Congress as a whole, including the arrest of Mr. Gandhi and all Congress leaders, and the promulgationof a Revolutionary Movements Ordinance which has alreadybeen prepared to deal with such an emergency.It is not yet clear whether the draft resolution whichthe Government of India have intercepted is sponsored byMr. Gandhi, or whether its terms will be accepted as they stand by the All-India Congress Committee on the 15thSeptember.    The Viceroy in his personal telegram No.1842-Srefers to recent correspondence with Mr. Gandhi in which thelatter has sought, and the Viceroy has agreed to, an inter-view on the present situation; and it is still possible thatMr. Gandhi may as^ to see the Viceroy before anything&quot;irrevocable&quot; is done.I am generally in full agreement with what the Viceroysays in his personal telegram.    The War Cabinet authorisedme an the 1st June to permit the Viceroy to enact theRevolutionary Movements Ordinance in any emergency in whichhe satisfies me that the necessity for it has arisen.    I have accordingly sent him a telegram, circulated herewith, agree-ing that if the Congress passes a resolution in terms such asthose contained in the intercepted draft, it would be preferable to tavc immediate action to paralyse the movementrather than wait further to see how the&quot; situation develops.At the same time I have stressed the importance ofbasing our action on the specific ground of the threat of anti-war activities, and of avoiding a procedure which coulbe interpreted as an attack on Congress as a political orgaisation irrespective of its attitude towards the war.   I h;accordingly suggested a variation in procedure which shoulunot however in any way lessen the Government of India&apos;s povfto taire comprehensive action as they propose.    I may explaithat the main powers that would be conferred by theRevolutionary Movements Ordinance, over and above those already provided by the Defence of India Act and Rules orother existing Acts, are the power of the Central Governmentto proscribe an organisation as illegal without being tieddown to definitions of illegal activities, and the power toconfiscate the funds and generally to break the machinery ofsuch an organisation.   These powers could equally well betaken by new rules under the Defence of India Act which, as stated in my telegram, would serve to stress the relation ofthe Government of India&apos;s action to the effectiveprosecution of the war.Copy No.

The Viceroy also proposes to issue an explanatorystatement if the emergency arises,    I am in correspondence with him over the terms of this statement and will circulate the text as soon as it is agreed.7     O    f\INDIA OFFICE.14th September 1940

I940omai^ XXXPersonal.,,   i-leuse see Home Department telegram Noo3480of to-day.   In preparing that telegram my Advisers have had before them the personal correspondence (? between) Gandhi and myself which has been repeated to you in my telegram of September 1st, Nos81763oS and 1764-Sj.September 8th N0.1814S, and September 11th, Kb.1843, and full account has been taken of that correspondence in framing our recommendationsthough, as it has been personal in character, I have thought it preferable to refer to it in n^r present separate telegram.2. His first letter is dated August 29th i090 2 days later than letter to Rajagcpalachari referred to in Home Department telegram,,Both in that letter and in his subsequent letter of September 6th he suggests that he will do nothing irrevocable without seeing me and it isconceivable that there may have been some mild change of heart since August 27th though there has beon not the least indication of that.,   &quot;hatI air, clear about, howeverv is that we must be prepared to strike at once and with the utmost vigour if Congress now challenges.   &quot;bile much of thedraft resolution is no doubt isors window-dressing, the statement in thelast  sentence of praagraph Ifo0l if embodied in any resolution which nayemerge from the All India Congress Committee would of course be actionableand could not be allowed to pass if made:   while reference to &quot;resistingactivities of. the British Government which are injurious to the Nation&quot;is also objectionable and reference in para.Kbo4 to Katngarh resolution is consistent with a decision that Congress must iiow resort to civildisobedience,,     But the essential thing is to leave Congress , if theyoverstep the mark, and force us to act against them, no time to organise,and to deal with them without a moment*s delay if they make it clear(as they would if they passed a resolution open to objection on groundsjust indicated) that they are out for trouble:    and I think it mostimportant., and I am. sure you will agree, that Cabinet should be apprised ofposition in advance and that we should if possible, get contingentauthc ity from thorn to deal with the situation which may result,,    I am sure tnat we can rely on your assistance in this.3. I find it hard myself to reconcile terms of draft resolution with &amp;andhi *s suggestion that he would see me before   anything:irrevocable is done, and we are oi course aware that- pressure is being brought upon him by sympathisers at home not to take the plunge without first discussing with me0   But if resolution of this nature were passedwhich contained, definitely objectionable and challenging matter suchas that to which x have referred to above it clearky would not be possiblefor me to hold my hand while Gandhi, resolution having been published,made ilia way to Simla to discuss it, and we should have to take immediateactions,

XXX,3480.    -7s have just seen an intercepted letter from Gandhi toRajagopalackariar dated August 27th enclosing the draft of a resolutionprepared by several members of Congress Working Committee to be passed by working Committee at its forthcoming meeting on September 13th and presumablyto be confirmed at meeting of All India Congress Committee to be held onSeptember 15 oh.   Full text of his draft is contained in my telegram Number.3492B20 We have no doubt whatever that if a resolution in this or similar terms Is passed tho only possible answer is the immediate and comprehensive action against Congress as a whole including the arrest of gandhi and all Congress leadors and putting into full effect the plans ofaction already agreed upon   between ourselves   and the Provincesc    You maynot yet have received copy oi ray letter of August 2nd to eJ 1 provincial governments which was soht &quot;bo India.

Prompt action would bo welcomed by considerable sectionof public opinion.   Delay would be interpreted as weakness, would loss ussupport and would lead to greater trouble and wider repression later on,Tou are aware of extent to which   military forces for internal securityhave already been depletedo11, For all these reasons we (? ask for) contingent butimmediate -approval of Hie Majesty1&apos;a Government to promulgation of revolutionary Movement Ordinance should decisions of Congress at theirforthcoming meetings render such a course in our opinion necessary-0   Wehave no doubt that terms of draft resolution would (? amount) to launching of a Revolutionary Movement as defined in that Ordinance avon if no   more precise form of Satyagraha is laid down than refusal of &quot;every kind of participation in war and in icon and money&quot;.   Such refusal would completeunlawful acts.   It is clear from reference to ifcmgarh resolution in para,.So.4 of draft that   .- &quot;Sataygraha&quot; means &quot;civil disobedience&quot; and this is confirmed by exhortation in paragraph No.I to take further steps indirection of non-co-operation and to resist activities of British Govt.40 Wo havo decided, if Ordinance is promulgated, that itsshort title should be changed to &quot;Emergency Powers Ordinance 1940&quot;, thisavoiding ass of word revolution, which might produce misleading impressionif reported without further explanation in other countries. * (OnriLssion)ofOrdinance should be accompanied by statement by His Excellency in terms which are being communicated separately.-,* Cable and Wireless are being asked for a repetition of this portion,,

Cypher telegram from Secretary of State toGovernment of India, Home Department.Dated 13th September, 1940.     (No.  of words  374). *5445.Immediate.Your telegram No,3480 of 12th September.    If Congressshould now embark on a programme which clearly aims atimpeding India&apos;s war effort,  I agree that it would be preferable to take immediate action to paralyse themovement rather than wait further to see how the situationdevelops.    A resolution by Congress which for examplecontained a passage (such as that telegraphed in your No.3492) clearly inciting to the refusal of every kind of participation in the war either in men or money would be ofsuch a character and would presumably be covered by the definition of revolutionary movement in Clause 2(2-);(b)(i)of the draft ordinance.    Since text in your 3492 is only adraft which may be modified I should like to have anopportunity of seeing precise terms of whatever1 resolution is actually adopted before finally authorising action.Terms of Ordinance are however primarily directed against movements which however extreme are ostensiblypolitical in character.    I suggest that in the present case it would be much more desirable to base our action on the specific ground of the threat of anti-war activities andalso that in any published statement we should make itclear that this is the motive of our action (I amtelegraphing separately certain comments from this point ofview on your telegram No.3491 of 12th September).    I suggestthat if we concentrate on this issue we shall find betterground for our initial blow against the Congress organisationthan if we were to fasten on the (perhaps intentionally)ambiguous passages in the resolution which seem to contemplatesome form and measure of Civil Disobedience or on passageswhich relate to the dissatisfaction of Congress with recentconstitutional announcements.    In other words I suggest thatit would be preferable to adjust our plans so as to stress thewar motive of our action as necessitated by threatened anti-war activities, and if possible to avoid a procedure whichcould be interpreted as an attack on Congress as a political organisation Irrespective of its attitude towards the war.Prom this point of view it is the basis of our initialaction which is important.    I quite agree that the Ordinancewould be the most suitable instrument for dealing with a sustained emergency as soon as the initial excitement hassubsided and could appropriately be promulgated at that stage;but I would like you to consider very urgently whether,  forthe purpose of the initial step of proscribing Congress andarresting the leaders, you could not obtain the requisitepowers by the immediate notification of rules under theDefence of India Act which would serve to stress relation ofyour action to the effective prosecution of the war.    Forexample, would there be any insuperable objection to theimmediate framing of new Defence Rules (assuming that they donot already exist) which would enable you to proscribe any-association which was planning acts directed to opposingeffective prosecution of the v/ar and in the case of an association so proscribed to take such measures as are essential pending promulgation of the Ordinance.
