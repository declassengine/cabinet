rglS DOCHMENT IS THE PROFERTx OP HIS BRITAJNNIC MAJESTIES GOVSRIfjSNT.COPY MO.   ^ bW.P.fG)(40) 336.T/AR   CABINET.27 th December, 1940. .4 MAN-POWER FOR&apos;&apos; THE ARMED FORCES-.- &apos; &apos;Memorandum.by the-Minister of, Labour and&apos;National Service.      &apos; -I desire the authority of the War Cabinet to submit to His Majesty afurther Royal Proclamation and tp; register and call up further age classesunder the National Service (Armed Forces) Act.Tne age&quot; classes covered by the&apos; existing Royal Proclamation will all,with the exception of a fraction of the 1903 class, have been registered withthe registration of the 1904. class on. the 11th and 18th January next. .&apos;&quot; Withthose registered on &quot;the&apos; latter dates we shall have sufficient men to meet thedemands of the Armed Forces on their present programme up to the end o.fMarch, 1941. &apos; We shall then,, however.,&apos;have in, hand only, about one month&apos;supply of men for the Army (100,000) and not much more than a month&apos;s supply,for the R.A.F. (25,000);    the Navy will have nearly three months&apos;&apos;&apos; supply (20,000)in hand.-    These reserves will be. materially reduced.if substantial numbers areenrolled in&quot; the Civil Defence Services under proposals&apos;now being considered.7/ithout-further legis.la.tipn, the .men required to meet the future-needs ofthe Armed Forces can be found from&apos;only&apos;two sources:-. \   \.;   .-.(a) the age groups 18 and 19 and 37 to 40, for whom a new Royal Proclamation   ,.will be required; - ,(b) withdrawal of exemptions under the Schedule of Reserved Occupations (by -substantial raising of ages in many occupations) and review of deferments. .My Department is already engaged in preparing proposals for a drasticrevision of the Schedule of Reserved Occupations for immediate discussion withthe Departments concerned, r. : It is unlikely.however, that any substantial, numberscan be released, from the Schedule before April,:.and accordingly it will benecessary from February,onwards .to. .register additional, age classes, in order tohave an adequate working balance from the,.end of March. &quot;.. .        ...    .- ,  ,I therefore ask the authority of the War Cabinet(l) to submit to His Majesty the draft of a new Royal Proclamation to he fiearly in January covering the remaining age groups 18 to 40 liable to!service under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act;.(2) to register and call up in the order shown the men of the following ag.19,    37,   38,    39,   40. ,;   ; .The numbers likely to be obtained from these age groups are:-Age 19.       Ages 57 - 40.Navy 32,000 7,000Army ( General Service 60,000 75,000( Tradesmen 30,000Air Force 64,000 10,000I should refer to the pledge given in connection with the calling up of menunder 20 during the passage of the National Service (Armed Forces) Act throughthe House of Commons.     This pledge was to the effect that men under 20 wouia1.
be amongst the latest classes to be called...    As, before calling on themen of 19, we shall have called men up to age 36, I think that pledge canbe regarded as having been amply fulfilled.     On the merits of the proposalto call up the men of 19 before those of 37 and&apos;upwards, there is room fora difference of view, but I believe that public opinion generally would prefer to see the younger men called up first.These two proposals will not do more&apos; than meet the present demands ofthe Army till about May.     If the full programme of military expansionstands, we shall probably be driven both to call up the men of 18 before theend of 1941 and to make revisions of the Schedule of Reserved Occupationswhich wi11 cause serious disturbance in industry.     To make the disturbanceas little harmful as possible, the projected changes of the Schedule should beagreed and announced at the earliest possible moment.     I aim at submitting areport on the proposed changes to the War Cabinet by the middle of January;but the date depends naturally on the course of discussions with theDepartments concerned. &quot;. -    1In respect of the men of 19 and 18 there is another pledge - that theyshould not be used for service abroad.     Hie Secretary of State for War may think it desirable to seek release from this-pledge, unless he considers thatan Army of the size now proposed can be. organised on the basis that men ofthese ages are not to be sent abroad.I take the occasion of referring to the memorandum of the Man--Power   .Requirements Committee approved by the Production Council that the rate of calling-up shall be adjusted to the rate of equipment.     If, as I hope, theproposal is approved by the War Cabinet, it should be followed by a; carefulsurvey of the prospects of equipment, so that both the military authoritiesand the National Service Department may have a definite programme of monthlynumbers to work to. ^I should emphasise that whatever other steps may be taken we must proceed at once with the arrangements for&apos;proclaiming and registering the five age-groups 19 and 37-40.     Otherwise we shall be in-danger of having&apos;no men available for calling up. in the early summer.(Intd.)   3. B,Is try of Labour and National Service.I December, 1940..H.Q,608-80 L.J.2.
