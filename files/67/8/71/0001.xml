Ms DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).C R E T.pjG) (40)  27-1. COPY NO.     48?nd October 1940.&quot; &apos; WAR   CABINET.LONDON TRANSPORT IN THE WINTER MONTHS.Memorandum by the Minister of Home Security.1. The Minister of Transport has called attention to theeffect of darkness and air raid warnings on passenger transport in London during the winter months.     Even without air raidlearnings it would be difficult to clear the Central London area in customary hours by the public services available.     Warningsor actual raids during the peak hours create a serious situation;services are liable to delay and interruption and large crowdsof people may.be exposed to considerable risk without adequateshelter or means of movement.     With the shorter days more peopletry to get home before dark and the peak movement becomes moreconcentrated.      The task of dealing with.the peak traffic is madeeven more difficult by the numbers- of people seeking shelter inthe tube stations early in the day.2. The immediate problem is to reduce as far as possible thenumber of persons travelling to and from the centre of London andto eliminate all unnecessary travelling, without in either casedisturbing unnecessarily the national war .effort.     Whatever stepscan be taken in this direction it will still be necessary to spread the numbers to be carried as evenly as possible over daylighthours and to provide the best possible transport services,particularly in the evening.     The problem has been examinedurgently by an Inter Departmental Committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of Transport, to whom I am much indebted jot the speed and thoroughness with which the report has been prepared.This Committee have now put forward certain interim proposals andthey will continue to investigate what further steps might be takenin the event of an even more serious situation arising if transport is dislocated on a more substantial scale.      The proposals have,been considered and generally approved by the Civil defence executive Sub-Committee, and action is already being taken to put them into effect.The action proposed is as followsi-(i) Evacuation.The Minister of Transport&apos;s Committee recommended that the&apos;Government should consider whether certain classes of business and profession should be required to leave London.      It is proposedto encourage this form of evacuation without prejudice to the needsI.   of the homeless and of mothers and children.     At the beginning ofthe war many firms in Central London earmarked accommodation fortheir staff in reception areas.      The Office of Works have a note of plans.made by nearly 900 firms engaged in commerce, insurance and finance.     Where evacuation was postponed there may now be
difficulty in ensuring that the accommodation which v/as ear-marked is still available or does not encroach upon that required for other purposes, but I propose to write to the firmsindividually about the need for evacuation.      Also, the Treasurywill discuss the matter with the Banks and financial interestsand the Board of Trade will consider the possibility of evacuating the Patent Office, and certain firms engaged inwholesale trade.(ii) Early closing and avoidance,of peak hours.In order to ;.encourage-the early return home of shoppersand the large numbers of persons employed in the retaildistributive trade, in Central London,, :I am arranging to discuss with the interests; concerned thd closing of shops at aprogressively;earlier hour not later than 3 p.m. at - the extreme.I shall however ensure that there is least interference with thepurchase of food and other essential commodities. -&apos;The Stock Exchange-has already limited its hours of,business and it is not anticipated that,it will be difficult for most people associated with it to avoid peak hour travellingThe Minister of Transport proposes to curtail the hours ofavailability of cheap day return tickets so that., for,example,:shoppers are encouraged to return before shops close.     &quot; , -(iii) Sleeping at place of business. - - &apos;      )P&apos;It is obviously desirable that&apos;no more -persons should be concentrated in the centre of London than-is absolutely essential, but if the London transport system cannot cope withpassenger traffic businesses must be prepared to keep a proportion of their staff on their premises overnight.      Ipropose to ask firms with suitable protected accommodation tomake this- provision without prejudice to the needs of publicshelter.(iv) Alteration of day or- half day holiclay.(v) Adjustment of hours.The Minister of Transport&apos;s Committee recommended (a) aAfferent day or half day holiday for different trades orbusinesses,   (b) a five day weekcspread ever six days - or a sixday week with shorter hours on each day,   (c) an adjustment of hours to enable staff to leave early while avoiding the releaseof staff at the same time.These proposals will be discussed with the retail trade.The Treasury and Board of Trade will  also discuss them - informal!with banks and insurance companies.      i propose to discuss them
generally with organisations of employers and with the T.U.C(vi) Summer time.Summer time will be continued throughout the winter.This proposal has the support of organisations of employersand employed persons.(vii) Transport services.The Minister of Transport has taken up with the london passenger Transport Board and the Railway Executive Committeecertain proposals for the improvement of transport facilitj.es.e.g. by informing travellers of alternative routes, provicingrelief express bus services and increasing the speed of trainsHelmets will be issued shortly to drivers and. conductors.(viii) Private cars.Car drivers will be asked to carry as many passengers aspossible.J. In the interests of security it is undesirable to givepublicity to the further evacuation of businesses and we she 1&quot;!ask the Press not to refer to this action.      Other measures will however not be fully effective unless a public appeal ismade to employers, and I propose to make a broadcast statement on the subject and to explain the proposals to the Press,H.M.MINISTRY OF HOME SECURITY.22nd October, 1940.
