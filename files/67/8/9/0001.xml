bSEC RE T.W.P.(Go)(ML.g09,,6TH AUGUST, .I9M.COPY WO.WAR CABINET.PAY,.,OF :tHE FIGHTING SERVICES -Memorandum by the %ance 11 or: of the Exchequer,1. My colleagues will be aware that there have beenstrong representations, shown in the number of questionsasked in the House and in the Press, for relieving membersof the Forces from the additional taxation imposed sincethe beginning of the war on tobacco  and beer and from thehigher postal and railway charges.      The Secretary of Statefor War has also experienced a certain amount of pressure tcincrease further family and dependants&apos;  allowances.2. A free issue of tobacco on the scale issued to thetroops in France would cost some  10,000,000 for each millijmen.      A limited sale of &apos;j0 cigarettes per man per week,at the prices ruling before the Budget of September, 1939,would cost some  2,500^000^     Any concession on beer, postageor railway travel would cost further substantial sums.   Itwould be possible to make a concession in respect, for instance,of tobacco but this would no doubt soon be followed by demandspostage,., etc.      Accordingly the suggestion hasmembers&apos;&quot; of the armed Forces should be givenpay of 6d. a day to compensate them for the.. Shinwell has made this specificsuggestion inaletter to &apos;the Prime &apos;Minister^      A general increasein the scales       family and dependants&apos;  allowances, whichhas been proposed by the Secretary of State for War, might amount to anything between  10 - 15,000,000 per million men.in relation tobeen made thatan increase in higher prices3. Clearly the Exchequer cannot afford a series of concessions on the various items in regard to which therehas been pressure ror improvement; yet each particularconcession has its own protagonists, and if one concessionis made, pressure for the others is likely to becomeintensified.    On the assumption,, which appears  to be well founded,  that concessions in certain respects could notbe avoided, the idea of   rover&apos;ng  all claims (includingclaims for increased family and dependants&apos; allowances)by an increase in pay of 6d. a day becomes attractive.The cost of such a concession is in the region of 93000,000 for each million men and,  substantial thoughthat figure is,  it is almost certainly less than a seriesof piece-meal concessions.    It would also have  the effectof countering&apos; to some small extent the agitation about the pay of the troops which has been caused independently bya comparison with the inflated wages drawn by munition workers, and might enable the Government to stave offn1

claims for increased pay to the i;&apos;orccs which will almost certainly ho pressed in the coming months.k. I have obtained the views of Ministers ofthe Service Departments on the whole question, inparticular on the suggestion of meeting all claims &quot;byan increase in pay of 6d. a day,,    i understand that theFirst Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of Statefor Air accept the suggestion,,    The Secretary of Statefor War doubts whether 6d. a day would be accepted ascovering family and dependants&apos; allowances but, subjectto the concurrence of the Army Council, agrees toco-operate with the Treasury and the other service departments in an effort to hold this line.    In thesecircumstances I propose to adopt this course.5. In announcing the concession I propose to emphasize that it is the fairest way of meeting all claims now put forward on behalf of the Forces.    TheGovernment obviously cannot afford more than a certainamount in meeting these claims and by   granting anincrease of pay it leaves the soldier free to determinew&apos;here   the shoe pinches him most. i,e0 whether on theprice of his tobacco or- on the impact of higher cost ofliving on his family on dependantsc    It is thought thatthe total cost of the concession, which will be in the region of  30,000,000 pen year, will be sufficientlyimpressive to damp down pressure for further concessions.(Intld,) k1&apos;,foTreasury Chambers , S 0.7.1.6TH AUGUST, 19^0.
