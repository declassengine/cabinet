(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET.W.P.(G)(4Q) 528o23RD DECEMBER,  19400 COPY NO.WAR CABINET.TRANSPORT OF COAL.Memorandum, &quot;by the Lord President of the Council.(Previous Re-ports W.P. (g)(40) 269).1. SiJecial efforts were made throughout the summerto build up reserve stocks of coal near the point ofconsumptiono     as a result? coal stocks at the beginningof the winter period were higher by about 10 million tons than they normally are at that time of year.Consumers are beginning, however, to eat intostocks;    and reserves will not meet the situation unlesscurrent deliveries are brought nearer to requirements for current consumption.2o       The problem is most acute in London south of the thames, and in the three Southern Divisions.    Duringthe three months September to November, 1939, deliveries to the Metropolitan area as a whole averaged 1*48 million tons per month.      During the  corresponding period in1940 they fell to an average of 1.16 million tons per month - a reduction of 22 per&apos; cent.      The fall indeliveries to the Southern Counties generally cannot be precisely measured in the absence of figures of rail-borne supplies, but the extent to which stocks are beingdepleted suggests that the fall was no less than in theLondon area03.       This decrease is mainJIy due to transport difficulties arising from the intensification of enemy attack.Sea-borne deliveries are substantially reduced by shipping losses, by the delays inseparable from the convoy system and the.need for de-gaussing, and by delays in the turn-round of ships arising- from enemy action,black-out, and other war circumstances.     Under presentconditions sea-borne deliveries, particularly toChannel ports, must be regarded as precarious;    and itwould be desirable if a larger proportion of the coal forthe South could be conveyed by rail.

9 0 0But there are limiting&apos; factors which make itdifficult for the railways to increase their contribution.They are carrying substantially more than they did beforethe war;    and at the same time their Carrying capacity is being materially red\iced, not only by actual damage from air-attack, but also by interruption of services on account of unexploded bombs and by loss efficiency in working during air-raid warnings at night.     And apartfrom these general factors, rail-borne deliveries ofcoal to the South are subject to two special limitations -(a) Air-raid conditions have substantially reduced the capacity of the exchange lines from North to South ofthe Thames in London, For a long time it was down to something like 30,$ of normal, though there has been a material improvement in the last two weeks.      (b)    the diversion of shipping to western ports has caused  seriouscongestion, especially on the Great Western Railway.This not only reduces very materially the amount ofcoal carried eastwards by that railway, but also make sit very difficult to get coal traffic from the Northernlines across the Great Western Railway to the South.To reduce the burden on the railways, all possible use is being made of canals for the carriage of coal.But the canal system can make at best only a smallcontributiono      It has, moreover, proved vulnerable to air attack.Road transport cannot profitably be used for the carriage of coal, except for short hauls or in a periodof grave coal famine.4.     Unless,, therefore,  some special priority were givento coal traffic, we could not expect our transport system to carry the same tonnage of coal this winter as it didin peace-time years   Any priority must be at the expenseof other traffic, and a general priority for coal traffic would prejudice the carriage of goods essential to our war efforto     Moreover, a general priority for coal couldnot readily be justified while (a)  stocks generally are so much in excess of normal, and (b) actual shortagesare local rather than general      The movement of population since the outbreak of war &quot;-which has not yetbecome stabilised - has materially affected thedistribution of demand for coal;    and for this reasonalone it would be wrong to apply general priority measures designed to maintain a supply of coa3. into all areassufficient to meet ordinary peace-time requirements.5.       I have therefore sought means of improving theexisting position (a) by general measures designed toreduce the delays impeding the flow of the existingtraffic, whether en route or at terminal points, and(b) by special measures to meet acute shortages inparticular areas?

At the outset of my enquiry into the coal situation,there as considerable congestion of coal wagons through-out the railway system - both in marshalling yards and atthe terminal points.. Special machinery was established to deal with this congestion, and the movement of-rail-borne coal was thus acceleratedo Delays in the dischargeof.sea-borne coal have also been materially reduced.6.       Having satisfied myself that all practicable steps had been taken to improve the general flow of the existingtraffic, I have concentrated attention on the areas whereactual shortages of supply were developing.(a) As mentioned above, rail-borne traffic across the thames in London was reduced during October and November toabout 30% of normal;    and as a result there was dangerof acute coal shortage in South London.     To meet this situation special arrangements were made to increase thesupply of sea-borne coal to ports on the south bank ofthe Thames, and also to introduce a new means of deliveryby railing coal to tipping stations on the north bank,taking it across the river by barge and carrying it on by rail and road for distribution in South London, Kent andSussex^(b) Close analysis of existing supply and estimateddemand indicated that in Kent, Surrey and Sussex currentdeliveries of coal fell short of current consumption byabout 30,000 tons per week,      To meet this deficiencysteps are being taken to run 16 additional coal trainsper day.     This will involve the suspension of some, andthe curtailment of other, suburban passenger services.(c) In Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire,Devon and Cornwall there is a gross deficiency of 14,700tons per week.      (The deficiency would have been greaterhad not arrangements already been made to carry coal fromthe North-Eastern coalfields by sea &quot;Northabout&quot;, and by rail to Cumberland ports and thence coastwise to smallports in North Devon, Somerset and Gloucester.)      Themethod proposed for meeting this shortage is to run fiveadditional trains per day from the Midland District andone from South Wales.      The addition of these trains will inevitably involve the curtailment of certain suburbanpassenger services in the neighbourhood of Birmingham,and may also make it necessary to take off some short-distance passenger trains on other parts of the Bristol-Birmingham line..      The inconvenience caused may beappreciable - particularly in- view of the dispersal of population following recent air attacks on Birmingham - and before any service is suspended the Ministry of transport will v/ish to ensure that no serious interference with thetransport of workers will result.

%Q- &amp;o u Q(d)    The congestion on the Great Western  Railway hasmaterially reduced the flow of rail-borne coal from SouthWales.    Arrangements have now been made to ship coal from south Wales to ports in North Devon and Somerset and torail it on from there to destinations in the Southerncounties.     Additional supplies of 5,000 to 6,000 tons aweek should be obtained by this means;    and it is hopedby this route to give some relief to the anthracite mines,which have suffered severely from the loss of theiroversea markets.The supply of rail-borne coal from South Wales is limited by the bottle-neck at the Severn Tunnel.    I have asked that operational experts shall make a specialenquiry into the possibility of increasing the number of mineral trains passing through the Tunnel, whether byaccelerating the rate of flow of traffic or by other means.70      I hope by these measures to meet for the time beingthe deficiencies in areas where it is likely that acuteshortages would otherwise develop.      The position through-out the country is being kept constantly under review, and where other deficiencies disclose themselves similaremergency measures will be taken to meet them.It should, however,  be remembered that our coal supplies still depend to a large extent on sea-borne traffic.As stated earlier in this memorandum,      sea-borne suppliesmust in present cirumstances be precarious;    and, if thetonnage of coal which can be brought to the South ofEngland by sea is materially reduced for any substantialperiod as a result of enemy action, it will at once benecessary to consider again the possibility of givingsome general priority to coal traffic on the railways,during the difficult winter months, even at the expenseof other important freights, in order to supply theessential needs of industry and the public utility service as well as domestic consumers.(lnt&apos;d) J.A.PRIVY COUNCIL OFFICE.23RD DECEMBER,  1940c
