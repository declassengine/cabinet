SECRET.W.P.(Q)(UP)259.20TH SEPTEMBER. 19U-Q.WAR CABINET.INSURANCE AGAINST PERSONAL INJURY IN AIR RAIDS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Lloyds&apos; underwriters, the Eagle Star InsuranceCompany and (it is believed)  a number of other leadinginsurance,.companies are undertaking to insure anyoneagainst death or certain severe injuries from enemy action.In the form offered by Lloyds, the policies are monthly andthe premium is one shilling per month per  50 insured.The Eagle Star Company appear to he issuing insurancesfor longer periods and I have seen a draft policy for aperiod of twelve months.     This Company have made arrangements by which employers can insure all their employees for any capital amount they wish, and no doubtother insurance companies will follow suit,2. I am told that pressure is developing on employers in certain industries, particularly those in whichemployees are asked to work under air raid conditions,to effect such insurances for the benefit of theirworkpeople;   most of the important newspapers have, Ibelieve, already insured their staffs in this way with theEagle Star Comp-any.      I am being pressed to say whetherthe premiums on these policies will he allowed as an expense in computing the employer&apos;s liability toExcess Profits Tax, and though I have so far refrained from answering this question, I am advised that if the policies are taken out in an appropriate form thepremiums will, as the law stands, he a proper charge incomputing Excess Profits Tax.     This means,  of course,that in the case of firms liable to this tax theinsurances will be effected at the cost of the Exchequer.The Eagle Star state that if they are given a favourableruling on the Excess Profits Tax point they expect largenumbers of armament firms and others to,effect suchinsurances,3. If this type of insurance is allowed to developalongside the State arrangements for compensation forwar injuries, it is likely to have the most serious financial and social effects.      It may be expected to spread like wildfire amongst firms liable to ExcessProfits Tax, since employers will be able to offerattractive policies to their workpeople without costtc themselves.     But even if the law were altered so as tirelieve the Exchequer of the cost of the premiums, therecan be little doubt that once the scheme becomes known,many employers will be under such pressure from theirCOPY NO.   k-6

workpeople that they would he hound to take out these policies even at their own cost.      If, as a result,workers in (for instance)  aircraft factories are insuredby their employers we may expect the dock workers^railwaymen, bus drivers and many others who are being askedto continue at work during raids, to press strongly to begiven similar security.     Undertakings such as therailways and the London Passenger Transport Board are inno position to add insurance premiums to their costs and we might soon reach a position in which stoppage of work during air raids on their undertakings could only be avoided if the Government were willing to take over thecost of insurance.     We should then have the State, atone and the same time, paying compensation for injuryunder its own scheme and paying large premiums to private insurance companies for insurance against the sameinjuries.4. It is difficult to see where matters will stop ifthe scheme is unchecked.      Those workers who are able to force their employers to insure them will become aprivileged class,  and we may expect the demand for insurance to spread to A.R.P. workers, hospital workers and perhaps,  indeed, the Armed Porces and even ordinary civilians.We may end up with something like universal &quot;insurance&quot;.The resultant cost would be enormous and could not be faced in addition to our existing and prospectivecommitments.5. For these reasons it seems essential that this form of insurance should be stopped and that it wouldappear not enough merely to legislate to prevent the deduction of premiums in computing liability to ExcessProfits Tax.      I could inform the underwriters and insurance companies privately that the continuance ofthis type of insurance is not in the national interest,and ask them to issue no more policies, and I think itis likely that this request will suffice, hut I think ifthis is done I must be ready to tell them that, ifnecessary, the Government would take powers to give therequest the force of law.      I am advised that this couldbe done by Defence Regulation.6. I should be glad to have the approval of the WarCabinet for the course proposed.(Initialled)      K.W.Treasury Chambers,Whitehall, S.W.1.20TH SEPTEMBER,  19h0.
