Baudouin&apos;s broadcast speech of the 22nd August, 1940.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,August 26, 1940.[21683a]Printed for the War Cabinet. August 1940.

. (Mr-this document is the property of his britannic majestvs government copy No.M. BAUDOUIN&apos;S SPEECH.IN his speech in Parliament Mr. Winston Churchill addressed himself, so itwould appear, rather to the English people than to world opinion, in view of thequality of the arguments and the passionate form of the speech. He repeatedaccusations against France to deal with which it is my duty. Mr. winston churchill reproaches France for having ceased to fight, but these accusationswe shall not cease to oppose to the repetition of lies, the repetition pfthe truth. . .In June 1940 in Metropolitan France, France s armies, dispersed, encircledand (decimated?) could only oppose to the invader the breasts of their men.Mr. Churchill affirms that two million English soldiers are at present ready forthe struggle. What I can affirm without&quot; fear of being refuted is that in themonth of June two English divisions, that is, 50,000 men, were fighting on our side. It is only one-tenth of the British Air Force that flew, at very rareintervals, over a battlefield that became increasingly long and vast.How can Mr. Churchill affirm that we had, outside Metropolitan France,sufficient forces to continue the struggle? The total of our overseas forces didnot reach the complement of one Army. If the English Premier has got tojustify himself before his public opinion for the serious setback in Somaliland,whom will he convince that the 5,000 men of our Jibuti garrison could haveaverted it? How far could the setback to his country have been prevented, hadour four divisions in North Africa and our 60,000 troops in Syria continued the fight at the time of the armistice ? It remains the truth that it was impossibleto continue the war, either on the metropolitan or on the external front.For Mr. Winston Churchill the &quot; crime of the statesmen of Vichy &quot; consists in not having abandoned French territory and not having continued the strugglein the Colonies. But it is to the honour of the Government of Marshal Petainthat not for one moment did it separate the chief of the country from the countryitself. To leave the soil of France would have been cowardly conduct, and a vain-glorious attitude. The first duty of the Government was to remain on the spot.Now, for having taken the painful decision of the armistice, the Government has toswallow a reproach (as if the English Premier had had authority to speak fqr thecombatants themselves ?).... All the combatants we have interrogated, voicedone reproach only, and that was not addressed to Petain&apos;s Government. This wasthat they had been far too strongly blinded to be able to become aware of the deficiencies and draw conclusions from events. We have been defeated because we did not know how to deserve victory. This is the reason why Britain at presentruns counter to France. France awaits her revival from herself alone. She means to rid herself of her errors to be able to reconstruct herself in body and soul, topurify herself and to become worthy of her past. What Winston Churchill callsthe &quot; prostration of the French people &quot; is the calm with Avhich she rebuilds hermoral strength, the gravity with which she understands the necessity of sacrifice,and the way in which she pulls herself together in preparation for a new order.France and the world ardently wish for that order.World dedicated to enslaved struggle.Winston Churchill dedicates not only the English, -which he has the right todo, but also the world to an enslaved struggle.Before his eyes the years pass like a programme of destruction 1940, 1941and 1942! If it were to be thus, if the war is to continue its ravages all overEurope and the world during so many months, it will be misery that will reign.No statesman conscious of his duties to his people, conscious of his responsibilitytowards Europe, can even in his thoughts adhere to this fatalism of destruction.There is another passage in Mr. Churchill&apos;s speech which claims the attentionof the people of France. That deals with the naval blockade, the terrible heraldof famine. As a matter of fact, many of our reserve stocks had been destroyed and, to live, France needs the produce of her Colonies. This we feel already andwe shall feel still more this winter. Fats, sugar, coffee, meat, are accumulatingm our overseas ports since the English Fleet is opposing their free passage: It[21683]
is known to you that Germany gave us a promise that these foodstuffs would be reserved for our civil population. You also know that, covered by this promise,on the 2nd August, I addressed precise proposals to London. The Premier of britain replied to them after three weeks of silence with a &quot; no discussions, it isimpossible! &quot; This is a refusal. It is necessary that you should appreciate all its gravity. This refusal is an act of hostility, worse perhaps than the painfulattempt at Mers el Kebir. The French Government will not bow before thisinterdiction; it must do all that is possible to spare to France the suffering ofhunger. It will fulfil this duty by the firmer determination as it regards thisdictatorship of famine, inhuman, * unworthy of a Christian country, inefficientand, finally, disastrous also for the country which establishes it. One can forgetthe horrors of the battle, but the pictures of the woman and the child sufferingis engraved on a generation&apos;^ memory.Pitiless weapon of blockade.Who does not feel that this pitiless weapon, striking the small and weak onesfirst, deals a blow at the vanquished before exhausting the conqueror. Who wouldnot feel that the food blockade casts its shadow and its effects far ahead into thefuture, without solving the problems of the present hour. It is the future ofwhich all of us have to think, we, members of a Europe which struggles at presentin a dark night, but which must rapidly organise itself, which must preserve itssplendid possibilities which it has not yet wished or dared fully to exploit. As Ihave already told you, an order of things died on the 10th May and we have betterthings to do than to regret it. To retrace one&apos;s steps is a folly; it is wisdomto look ahead.I have been searching in Mr. Churchill&apos;s speech for a conception of thefuture, for an indication as to the construction of a new social economic andpolitical edifice which would lead us out of the convulsions since man has notbeen wise enough or imaginative enough or brave enough to work in peace to suchan end.It will not be by abusing certain privileges in Gibraltar and elsewhere thatEngland will be able to justify herself; and not by claiming innocent victims thatshe will justly attain within the Order of to-morrow that place that belongs tothe English people Avith its admirable material and moral qualities. Within that order the peoples of the Continent will be united in a growing solidarity. Byinflicting upon a large part of Europe the privations of hunger, Mr. winston churchill excludes England from this necessary solidarity which alone wouldmake possible the creation of a juster, more charitable and more peaceful world.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,A ugust 26, 1940.
