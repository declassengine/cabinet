SECRET.   &apos; JW.P.(G)(4Q) 289.    .. . COPY NO. j5TH NOVEMBER.  19400WAR CABINET.     .:   &apos;:&quot;OUR IMPORTING CAPACITY IN THE SECONDSYEAR OP THE WAR.Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio^I have -been in consultation with the Minister ofTransport and the Minister of Shipping with the object ofestablishing .in the light of the experience of the last fewmoriiiKs how far our importing capacity is likely to ho affected.in the coming months by congestion of port and transport&apos; fabilities in this country.     &apos;    :&apos;.&apos;\&apos; .-&apos; 20   &apos; Al-tihad been my intention &quot;to arrange for this matter to-be disctissed in the Economic Policy Committee but in view of the, fact.that the Minister of Shipping has now&apos; circulated a paper(W.P. (40)411) in which from the purely shipping point of view heexpresses doubt as to our capacity to achieve the import programmes to which the Departments are working, I have thought that it wouldbe of advantage if the Cabinet had before them at the same timethe conclusions which I. have reached by approaching the sameproblem from a different; anglen    These may be summarised, asfollows:- r(i) The capacity of our west coast ports, talcing no account either of discharge overside into coastersand lighters or of improvements now in hand,may be estimated at 37o5 million, tons per annumunder optimum condition^    The capacity inSeptember.was at the.rate&apos; of about 31o5 million tons per annum&quot; and is: now probably- :rid,more than 2705million tons*   To these figures should be added some million tons p-er annum in respect of dischargeoverside.(ii) The capacity of our east coast ports under normalconditions is at least 40 million tons per annum*This greatly exceeds, however,  the weight of imports&quot;        -      passing through these ports in recent months and.the weight which ih present circumstances it wouldbe practicable to pass through them   The use whichwe can to-day make of-east coast ports is limitednot by their capacity but by the difficulty and......danger of taking ships northabout and by.the vulnerability of the Port of London to air attacks(iii) If, under conditions similar to those obtainingwe make full use of our west coast ports and of discharge overside into coasters and- lighters weshould require, in order to fulfil the import programme of &quot;43 million tons , to which departments are now working, to take at least 13 million tonsof imports into east coast ports.    This is more than half as much again as was achieved in August by the ports northwards from Grimsby, and about equalto the amount taken by the whole of the east
coast ports in that month   What additional imports we should be forced to table  northaboutwould depend upon the extent to which conditions   ,at west coast ports deteriorated in:consequenceof air attacks, . railway congestion, etc.,.What further imports- we elected to&apos; sendnorthabout would depend upon our assessment of the risks involved, the advantages of keeping,a margin .of unusedcapacity on the west, and the convenience of unloading cargoes near eastern consuming centres.(iv)On the most unfavourable hypothesis as to the effectiveness of air attacks, which- in-the lightof recent experience, it would be prudent tomake, the west coast ports will be able tomaintain throughout the second year of war a rateof importation not far short of the August rate.&quot;If this were the only factor involved, it would imply that the most that the east coast portsJneedbe called upon to do should not greatly exceed theirrate of performance in August, since total imports during August (corrected for seasonal variations)were at the rate of 42 million tons per annum andwere thus onlyi million tons short of the presenttotal programme for the second year of war.   But . &apos;if the west coast ports cannot improve upon theirperformance in August, when there was still a largemargin of unused capacity,, the east coast portscannot be. expected to maintain their rate of     ;&apos;.performance in that month if as little use ismade of the port of London as in recent weeks.(v) There is a real danger that port and shipping difficulties taken together may set a lower&quot;limit. &apos; &apos;    to our importing capacity that we have so farthought it necessary to contemplate0(vi) This danger as regards ports, warehousing andtransport arises chiefly from the followingcontingencies:(a) The risk of serious damage to the Merseyports and to a less extent the risk toother West Coast ports;(b) the risk that the Port of London mayremain closed, for long periods;(c) the risk that the movement of shipsnorthabout may be subject to interruptionthrough increased enemy pressure;(d) the risk of internal transport congestionowing to shortage of vehicles (particularlyspecial types of railway waggons), enemy action, and difficulties of reception and storage at works and warehouses^Our estimate of port capacity in the second year of war must depend upon how high we rate thesecontingencieso &apos;   -
(vii) If, as is likely, port congestion, becomes moreaggravated during the winter, and shipping lossesdiminished, we might meet the situation to someextent: --(a) by sending ships on longer voyages so as to relieve the ports and take advantage ofsupplies offered to us on specially favourable terms;(b) by making additional provision for thedischarge of cargoes by using berths normallyused for loading exports,(viii) Our port capacity at the end of the second year ofwar can hardly be as great as it will have been overthe average of that periods     The same will be true of shipping capacity, both because of continuedsinkings and of possible military needse    Theprospect of a continuing contraction in port and shipping capacity makes still more urgent the need to build up stocks of imported foodstuffs and materials-for future use through present economy,(ix) In September total irfrports (excluding tankerimports) fell by 900,000 tons as compared with august and amounted only to 3 million tons.Entrances of shipping with cargo during the monthsof September and October were on the average some20 per cent,  lower than in August,,    This would point to an average monthly rate of importationoVer these months of 3,1 million tons, a fall of800,000 tons a month as compared with August.    after making an allowance for seasonal corrections, for continued sinkings, and for new construction, this represents an annual rate of irrrportation of not morethan 33 - 34 million tons(x) We may, I hope, assume that on the average duringthe second year of the war&apos; we shall be able to do better than in October last;    but I foaL that thesituation is such that the present import programme .of some 43 million tons should at once be reviewedsuch a manner as to ensure that, if in the courseof the year, we are unable to import more than 35million tons- of raw materials and foodstuffs, theimports which we do secure are those which we most urgently require for the prosecution of the war.The broad results of this revision should, I suggest,be submitted as soon as possible to the economic policy Committee by whom any points of major importance could be referred to the War Cabinet for decision.(Intld) A.
