SECRET.W.P.(GUUO) 211.9TE AUGUST.  19^0.COPY NO. t/WAR CABINET,BREVITY.Memorandum &quot;by the Prime Minister.To do our work, we all have to read a mass of papers.Nearly all of them are far too long.      This wastes time,while energy has to be spent in looking for the essentialpo int s.I ask my colleagues and their staffs to see to it that their Reports are shorter.(i) The aim should &quot;be Reports which set outthe main points in a series of short, crispparagraphs.(ii) If a Report relies on detailed analysis of some complicated factors, or on statistics,these should be set out in an Appendix.(iii) Often the occasion is best met by not a full-dress Report, but an _consisting of headings only, which can be expanded orally if needed.submittingAide-memoire(iv) Let us have an end of such phrases as these:&quot;It is also of importance to bear in mind the following considerations......&quot; , or&quot;Consideration should be given to thepossibility    of carrying into effect.....&quot;.Most of these woolly phrases are mere padding, whichcan be left out altogether, or replaced &quot;by asingle word.      Let us not shrink from using the short expressive phrase, even if it isconversational.Reports drawn up on the lines I propose may at first seemrough as compared with the flat surface of officialese jargon.But the saving in time will be great, while the discipline of setting out the real points concisely will prove an   aid toclearer thinking.W.S.C.10, Downing Street.&apos;9TH AUGUST,    19h0.
