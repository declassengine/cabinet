Bill to extend the duration, g the present Parliament,,Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1.     The life of the present Parliament expires on the 25thovember and legislation to extend its duration ought to be introducedithout delay. &apos; ;2.     In the course of the last war five separate Acts were passed,ach extending the life of Parliament for short periods, ** theumulative effect being that the period was prolonged from five years eight years.3..    A draft Bill is attached prolonging the life Of Parliament forne year..    As one or more further prolongations may be required, itfluid,.. I think, be convenient to make provision in the Bill for.fecting such further prolongations without further legislation.     Ar&quot;&apos;ng, Lords and Commons are ^11 concerned in the prolongation nfrliament, it is proposed in the Bill to make provision for suchirther prolongation by means of an Order in Council made after anhjliress presented by each House.4.     The alternative clause in square brackets fellows &quot;the precedentt during the last war, but if this form be adopted, a fresh Bill11 be required for each further prolongation.     As under warPcumstances there may be from time to time difficulties about meetingsParliament, there are, I suggest, advantages in following the firsturse and avoiding the need for the several stages of a Bill mi eachCaslon,H.M.e Office,&apos;th October, 1940,
