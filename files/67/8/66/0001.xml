266.iy*h October. I94QaWAR CABINET.SALE OP VESSELS ORDERED BY THE GO^BBIOaBMT. TO EKEKMQSBS. WHP H&amp;M LOSTMSIORaiNDUli EC THE MINISTER OP SHIPPING:pi pWhen, on 4th October, the War Cabinet discussed this subject withreference to paper W.P. (G) (40) 216, I was asked to submit a further note.I appreciate the force of the points raised in that discassion,but it is necessary to bear in mind that the Government have, as adefinite part of their settlement with shipowners for the hire of ships under requisition, formally recognised the vital importance to owners,as \vell as to the nation, of an effective policy for replacing the mercantile Marine.The terms of the undertaking given in the White Paper, Command 6218,will be found in the Appendix to this Memorandum.   There is no question to which shipowners attach more importance than that they should been abled to replace vessels lost in the war, so that they may be able to compete with the shipping of foreign countries immediately the war is over.   Our shipowners would suffer a grievous disability, and the economic strength of the nation would be seriously impaired, if they are not ableat once to apply their skill and experience in recovering for the country a large share of the carrying trade on the main shipping routes of theworld.   Handicapped to some extent they must be, by their losses and thetemporary abandonment of certain trades, but we can reduce theirdisabilities by enabling them now to make good the gaps in their fleet and thus maintain their organisations in full readiness.   The Governmenthave emphasised their sense of the importance of maintaining theBritish Mercantile Marine in adequate strength, and in a position of fullcompetitive efficiency, and have said that they will keep this matter inmind.An immediate step which can now be taken is to give those ownerswho have lost ships by war or marine risks the opportunity of purchasingships ordered and constructed by the Government.    If we do not take this step, which is so clearly open to us, I fear that shipowners will begin to doubt the value of the assurances which we have given, and to pressme for some definition of the Government&apos;s attitude.   It seems to me thatany scheme for ensuring replacement of tonnage would have to include, as animportant feature, the allocation of the vessels constructed during the war to those owners who had suffered losses.Apart from this, I should welcome any current action which is likelyto ease the problem of liquidating after the war the standardised ships which we sha.il have constructed and the old foreign tonnage which we havepurchased.   There could, I think, be no advantage in retaining these vessels in Government Ownership, until the end of the war; we shall have complete control over their operation by bringing them under requisition as soonas they are commissioned.It must be borne in mind that we are bound to pay the shipownerscompensation for ships lost.   It must surely assist the public financesif owners are willing t? accept payment for their lost vessels in kindinstead of calling upon the Exchequer for the cash compensation to whichQ they are entitled, while the Government is left to pay, also in cash,for the ships which it constructs.R. H. C.IjHlSTRY OF SHIEPHT&amp;.17th October, 1940

(APPENDIX)His Majesty&apos;s Government felt bound to take the view that ratesof hire to be paid for the use of requisitioned vessels during the war should be based upon a proper allowance for running expenses, a proper provision for current depreciation and a reasonable return upon capital,,They were unable to agree that it would be proper to include in these rates, the cost of which would fall on the community during the war,any allowance towards making good past arrears of depreciation (apartfrom the allowance for accruing depreciation) or towards building upprovision for replacement in the future.   At the same time His Majesty&apos;sGovernment recognise that their predecessors in office in 1939 found itnecessary to formulate a number of proposals for according financialassistance to British shipping which they invited Parliament to authoriseby the British Shipping (Assistance) Bill, 1939.   The progress of this legislation was interrupted by the outbreak of war, but the necessityof maintaining the British Mercantile Marine in adequate strength andin a position of full competitive efficiency is recognised no less stronglyby His Kaje&apos;sty&apos;s Government to-day.   They will, therefore, keep thisquestion constantly in mind as one with which it will be necessary toask Parliament to deal in due course.
