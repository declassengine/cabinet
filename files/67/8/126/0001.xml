THE   CONTROL OF FACTORY API). J3TORAGE.., SPACE..Report by the Lord President&apos;a Committee.1, The expanding renuirernents of essential productionand the damage caused by enemy air attach are togetherproducing a growing shortage of accommodation for (a)manufacture and (b) storage.     Government Departments and private firms are engaged in a competitive scramble for the limited amount of space available, and as a result theexisting accommodation is not being put to the most profit-able and economical use.     The position has been fully investigated by Committees of the Production Council and theEconomic Policy Committee, and all Departments concerned are agreed that there is urgent need for an effective controlover the allocation of factory and storage space,2. A detailed scheme of control has been worked out.The following are its main features, for which we ask theapproval of the War Cabinet:-(a) A Controller-General of Factory and StorageSpace will be appointed:,Factory space and storage space overlap -factories may be used for storage and warehouses may have to be used asfactories - and it is essential therefore that there should be unified control.The Controller-General will, however, be assisted at Headquarters by two Controllers,one dealing with factories and the other withstorage .(b) The Controller-General will be responsible tothe President of the Board of Trade,Air-raid damage and schemes of dispersal willtogether make it impossible to find factors&apos;space sufficient to meet the needs of vitalproduction except at the expense of firms engaged in non-essential production;    andthe executive v/ork of the Controller-Generalmust therefore give effect to the generalpolicy underlying the Limitation of SuppliesOrders.      The allocation of storage space must also be directed in accordance with ageneral policy regarding the war-time organisa-tion of industry.      In both cases theresponsibility for policj/ rests with theBoard of Trade.(c) It will be the    uty of the Controller-General toprepare a comprehensive Register of Factory and at  or a ge Premi se s.Much information is already available,  in theIndex of Properties maintained by the Ministryof Works and Buildings, and in the Register of factories held by the Ministry of Labour.    TheController-General will &quot;be able to make an effective start on the basis of the information which can be made immediately available to him;

but in order to discharge his full function he willhave to pixt in hand a special survey to collect more detailed information about factory and storage accomodation throughout the country including * forexample, capacity,  suitability for the variousprocesses of manufacture or types of storage,availability of labour, housing, transport and power,and the use to which the premises are already being put.    It need, not take long to complete the essentialparts of this survey; and from the informationalready available the Controller-General will be ina position at once to give valuable advice to departments and firms desiring accommodation.    TheController-General, in consultation with the approp-riate Departments, will also make such surveys ashe may consider necessary of accommodation whichcould if necessary be adapted for use for storageor factory purposes.d) The Control will derive its authority from two sources -(i) Government Departments will be required, by thedecision of the War Cabinet, to obtain theauthority of the Controller-General (either at headquarters or, in suitable cases, through hisRegional Officer mentioned in the following paragraph) before (i) requisitioning any premises for the purpose of manufacture orstorage or (ii) requisitioning for other purposes any premises ordinarily used for thepurpose of manufacture or storage.Provision will bo made, &quot;by agreement withthe Departments, for this rule to be waived inthe case of requisitioning for temporary user(e.g. temp or a r 3&apos; quartering of troops in an emptyfactory, or temporary storage of goods salvagedfrom buildings damaged, by air attack).(ii) Private firms will be urged at once not totransfer their premises from one part of thecountry to another, except as part of an approved scheme of dispersal or otherwise atthe request   of a Government Department.   At alater stage it is contemplated that private firms will be required, by a Defence Regulation,to obtain the licence of the Board, of Trade beforeacquiring premises, by lease or purchase, forthe purpose of carrying on therein a business or manufacture or storage not carried on thereimmediately previously.    The exercise of thislicensing power will be delegated to theC ont roller-Gene ra2.e) The operation of the control will not involve delay.The Controller-General will be able to help Departmentsneeding accommodation with information of premisesavailable which meet their requirements, and will thus make it unnecessary for them to spend so much time and trouble in looking for accommodation them-selveSo   Moreover, the fact that the accommodationhas been allocated by the Controller-General willprotect the Department or firm concerned againstcompeting claims or displacement by other departments or interests.

Tito Controller-General will appoint in each of theCivil Defence Regions whole-time officers whowill have full power to act on his behalf inall matters which can       fl^^lt with locally.These offices will work in close co-operationWith the Regional staff of the Ministry of V/orks?^d^B^i^4in B.-r*ho exercise powers of requisitioningon behalf of the civil, hepartments, andyWith the   gI-ivisional Controller of the Ministry of labour on the labour aspe:ts of any proposal.(f) The Controller-General and his officers will not carry out the formal process of requisitioning.The Controller-General and his staff will have full power to determine the allocation of premises (subject to the priorities and appealsmentioned below), and will be able to put theDepartment or firm in possession of the premisesallocated to it a    The legal and financial pro-cesses involved - settlement of which follows and does not precede the requisitioning - will,however, continue to bo carried out by theDepartments already exercising requisitioningpowers (i.e. the Ministry of Works and Buildingson behalf of the civil Departments, the service departments and in emergencies the Ministry of aircraft Production) who have built up expertstaffs experienced in this complicated work.Here again no delay is involved by this division oflabour.    In an emergency, the local representativesof the Controller-General, the Ministry of works and Buildings end the Department requiring the accommodation could together complete on the spot(in consultation, as necessary, with the area board or the Joint Committee mentioned in thefollowing paragraph) all the essential processes of allocation and requisitioning necessary toenable the Department to take possession of thepremises it re quire dn(g) In the allocation of premises the Control will haveregard to priorities determined either by agree-ment with the Departments concerned or, in theevent of a dispute, by appeal to the Chairman ofthe Production council I,For this purpose the Controller-General will havethe assistance at Headquarters of a Committee of senior officials of all the Departments interested(including; not only the Service and supply departments but also the Ministries of Transport,Shipping and Labour and the Health Departments),This Committee will be mainly concerned with questions of priority, and will assist theController-General in the settlement of disputesover the allocation of particular buildings.    Inany case where the Controller-General cannot settlea particular allocation by these means it will be his duty to refer the matter to the President ofthe Board of Trade, by whom it will be submittedto the Chairman of the Production Council for final settlemento

Advisory machinery will also he established locally forthe assistance of the Regional representatives of theController-General,      The Area Boards will ordinarilybe used as a nucleus for this purpose.      But the local officers of the Controller-General will also co-operate with the Emergency Reconstruction Panels established bythe Ministry of Aircraft Production;    and, where the panel has been expanded, with any Joint Committee suchas those established at Coventry, Birmingham and southampton.3. We should draw special attention to the fact that, if theseproposals are approved by the War Cabinet, two consequences will follow:-(a) The earmarking of buildings entered in the Central register of Accommodation maintained by the Ministry of Works and buildings,which was designed to secure a lien on thebuilding for the earmarking Department on the basis of&quot;first come, first served&quot;, will be abandoned so far as concerns factory and storage space as from a date to befixed when the new control is in effective operation.After that date all factories and warehouses earmarkedbut not already taken up will cease to be reserved forthe Department which earmarked them unless that department has before the appointed date established a claim, to the satisfaction of the Controller-General, to continue tokeep them reserved for its use.(b) The decision reached by the War Cabinet on the 9th December(W.M.(40) 302nd Conclusions, Minute 7) will need to be modified so far as concerns the procedure of the Ministryof Aircraft Production in securing buildings required inconnection with the removal or dispersal of aircraft factories, though no question of priority will necessarily be affected.      The Ministry of Aircraft Production will,like all other Departments, avail themselves of theservices of the Controller-General and his staff for thepurpose of finding the accommodation which they require,and the Controller-General in allocating accommodation will act in accordance with any general instructions as topriorities which may be laid down by the Production council or the War Cabinet.4, Finally, we think it necessary that, pending the establishmentof a complete system of control, an authoritative statement should beissued on behalf of the Government discouraging uncontrolled transferof industry away from bombed areas.      Such unregulated transfers may develop into a refugee movement of industry which would endanger theindustrial life of the country without giving any compensatingguarantee of security for the firms which move.      Apart from transferscarried out on the advice of a Government Department or in pursuanceof an approved scheme of dispersal, we should insist upon a &quot;stayput&quot; policy for industry;    and it should be made clear that, in the interval before the establishment of a comprehensive -control, no firmshould transfer its factory from one part of the country to anotherwithout first seeking the advice of the Controller-General.-SIGNED ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEEJOHN ANDERSON.Chairman.   .richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.20th December, 1940. -4-
