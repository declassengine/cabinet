&apos; .....133rs DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTY &apos;S government.-.2,101,(40) 249. .    -v Jftth September&apos;. -1940. COPY NO.      W&apos;WAR CABINET.HORSE   RACING.Memorandum by the Minister of Home Security,1. I desire to obtain the decision of the War Cabinetupon the question whether Horse Racing should continue to be permitted.2. The present policy is to allow racing unless, in thecase of a particular meeting, there are reasons on military grounds or on account of air raid risks why it should not beheld.    The racing programme for the autumn and winter is,,however, much curtailed compared with the normal peace timeprogramme.    There is also an understanding with the JockeyClub that, if the circumstances so require, a meeting mayhave to be cancelled at short notice.3. At present race meetings are not being -permitted inthe neighbourhood of London, e.g. at Hurst Park and Windsor,A meeting at Newmarket was also cancelled recently at therequest of the military authorities.   Meetings have, however, been permitted at Manchester and Edinburgh.4. I understand that it is the view of the militaryauthorities that this ad hoc policy should be discontinued and thatit is now desirable, on general grounds, to abandon racingaltogether,5. It should, however, be remembered that,  subject tocertain restrictions, football matches and greyhound meetingsare being permitted, and football grounds and greyhound tracksare generally on more central sites than race courses.6. I am still of opinion that, purely from the securitypoint of view, it is unnecessary to depart from the policydescribed in paragraph (2) of this Memorandum,    I recognise,however, that other Departments have special interests in thequestion and that there are   general considerations which haveto be considered.7&apos; On the one hand, the continuance of racing is of assist-ance in maintaining the country&apos;s morale, and is of advantage in bringing money from abroad.    On the other hand, there must always be some risk in the congregation of a number of people in one place especially at advertised times, and the holding of raceI   meetings may in present circumstances create road and rail trafficI   difficulties.    It may also be considered that racing is, at themoment, unseemly.8. Accordingly, while I see no reason from the point of viewof my Department to recommend a change of policy, I think it rightto submit the question to the War Cabinet for a ruling.^of Home Security.
