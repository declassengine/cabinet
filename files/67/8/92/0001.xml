S EC E ;ETW.P,(G) (4-0)292.5TH NOVEMBER, 1940.COPY NO.   ^/WAR   CABINET100 OCTANE FUEL.COMPLETION OF THE THORNTON PLANT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.The question raised &quot;by the Minister of Aircraft Production in his memorandum W.P.(G)(40)281 on the subject of 100 octane fuel is a difficult one.It may assist the War Cabinet in reaching a decision if I set out the supply position as I see it.2. It is estimated that the force at which we are aiming will consume850,000 tons of 100 CGvane fuel per annum0 To meet this requirement it is likely that the following quantities will be available from sources other than the U.S.A.:Heysham (Government Plant)Trinidad (Government Plant)Billingham (I.C.I.)Stanlow (Shell)Abadan (Anglo-Iranian)Aruba (Standard Oil of N.J.)Palembang (Standard Oil of N.J.)Pladjoe (Shell)150,00080,00015,00055,00050,00050,00050,00050,000tons,tons,tons.tons,tons,tons,tons.tons.Total500,000 tons.We shall thus require a further 350,000 tons per annum, and if we discount thelast two of the plants mentioned above which are in the Dutch East Indies the requirement would be increased to 450,000 tons.3. It may be argued that the U.S.A. should be able to supply this quantitybut we do not know what American consumption will be, what her plans are for the accumulation of reserves, or what increased commitment she may have to foreigncustomers other than ourselves.     Moreover the purchase of this quantity of fuelwould involve a substantial dollar commitment.4. The term &quot;100 octane&quot; as used in the U.S.A. corresponds to 90 octane onour standards.     Special tests have therefore to be imposed on American fuel.Some firms have been unable to pass these tests, and the quality of the product of others on whom we might have to rely is at present untested,5. We ought to ensure against interruption of production at the Heyshamplant,I     6. It is estimated that the Thornton Plant would produce 200,000 tons perannum towards the deficiency.     In view of the uncertainties of the position, Ithink we should be well advised to continue its construction.A.H.M.S.Air Ministry,5th November, 1940,
