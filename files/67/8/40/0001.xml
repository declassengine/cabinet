THIS rXXMKEHT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT./SECRET.      &apos; &apos;&apos;  &quot; COPY -HO.   S&quot;bW.P.(&amp;) (MO)2hD.     &apos;21 at September, 1940.ft - -. . - - IIAR     CABINET.. - . PURCHASE OP MACHINE TOOLS IN AMERICA.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.I should like to bring to the.attention of the War Cabinet theserious setback which our munitions programme will reoeive unless theUnited States Government can be persuaded to take a more favourableview of our Machine Tool requirements.The number of machines for which orders placed by the UnitedKingdom have not yet been fulfilled is 12,500 (approximate value 16,000,000).     There were also orders placed by Prance before thecapitulation amounting to 12,712 machines (approximate value 0 65,000,000),After the capitulation of Prance these orders were taken over by theUnited Kingdom, but the programme was reduced as follows:-1. U.K. orders on American manufacturers were reduced to the extentof 1 ,&quot;167 machines.2. French orders on American manufacturers were reduced to the extentof 2,047 machines.     The British Purchasing Commissionalso diverted some machines to the Dominions and other uses.The result is that the number of machines available fromthe original French orders is believed to be under 10,000.The whole position has, however, been altored by the action ofthe United States Defence Advisory Committee which on July 21st statedthat our total orders including those taken over from the French covered6Qfi of the machine tool capacity of the United States available untilthe end of 191*0 and expressed the opinion that this was in excess ofUnited Kingdom vital war needs.     They therefore opposed the export of machine tools into areas exposed to bombing, oxcept where such topiswere required to round off facilities in existing units or units nearing completion.     As a result of the Committee&apos;s action the whole of the exports from America were put under licence and we are required to justifyeach purchase.     It is clear from cables and telephone conversations that theUnited States authorities take a different view of the orders originallyplaced by this country from that which they take of those originallyplaced by the French.     Our prospects of obtaining the latter machinesappear to be distinctly less favourable.In these circumstances we have made certain proposals whichare set out in the attached copy of telegram No.75 Pursa.     The resultof this arrangement would be to give us in addition to our own purchasesapproximately 8,000 of the French machines.     We have also suggestedthat a certain proportion of the future American machine tool outputshould be reserved for this country.     Sir Y/alter Layton will naturallyfgt press our point of view on this vital part of our war programme-nme and Iam making arrangements at once to send a machine tool expert to america to help him and the British Purchasing Commission.     I feel, however, that/we
.w.o. should., neglect no opportunity to bring home to the United StatesGovernment the seriousness of any substantial reduction in the numberAmerican machines made available to this country - it would cause atotally disproportionate reduction in our war output, for in certain cases the use of existing productive capacity would have to be entirely suspended.I feel that I have taken all possible action within mysphere and I shall now be glad if the War Cabinet will considerwhether any further special action can be taken.(Intld.).   H.M.Ministry of Supply.September 21st, 1940.L.902.
Cypher telegram to Mr. Haggard, (New York),Foreign Office.      14th September, 1940, 5, 10 p.m.No. 75   PlffiSA.HOST IMMEDIATE.For Purvis and Layton from Salter.Your Pursa 87.1 * Please refer to memorandum on machine tools given by machine tool Controller to Layton Section 5 for account of United Kingdom andFrench Machine tools already released by us.     Thi3 lias resulted from ourcontinuous survey of requirements.2.Z We would point out that whereas the expansion of American Armamentproduction is largely in the planning stage and in many cases the need formacnine tools will not therefore, be presumably immediate, all toolswhich can be obtained now for this country can be utilised immediatelyfor production of munitions from existing plant or plants approachingcompletion to meet our critical needs.3. We understand American reluctance to part with toolsaccentuated by accounts of enemy attack indicating destruction of toolssent here.   Layton will be able to explain from his experience remarkablylimited damage done by air attack to factories and tools.    Nothing thathas happened since he left materially alters situation as he knew it.4. As stated in previous telegrams we must maintain vital rightto United Kingdom orders placed and accepted over long period,    Itt&amp;leFrench tools might be considered in a different category, nevertheless wegratefully accepted assignment since our needs had increased proportionately wiwith French collapse.5. It should be remembered that in accepting French contracts wehad to take them as a whole and machine tools constituted large part ofinducement to us to do so.6. In order to get definite and co-operative agreement we authoriseyou to settle on following lines.     All tools whether British or Frenchorders scheduled for shipment from works during the next few months to be shipped here.     With regard to tools scheduled for shipment from works after an agreed date, all British tools to be sent to us as ordered subject to our undertaking to review our needs carefully and continuously -with a view to considering any urgent American claims.     All French tools scheduled for shipment after the agreed date to be released to United States of Americasubject to American administration giving similar undertaking to consider oururgent claims.7. Over and above this arrangement it is necessary that we should&quot;be assured reasonable proportion of future output of expanded Americanmachine tool industry to meet our strict necessities as war proceeds,8. In proposing these arrangements we have appreciated that Americanprogrammes are in effect joint programmes.9. We 7i&amp;ll leave you to negotiate the agreed date doing the best you can.     In any case it is absolutely vital that the date should not be earlier than 1st November,   You will, of course, understand phrase &quot;scheduled for shipment&quot; to mean tools expected or promised to be completed in addition tothose ready for shipment.
