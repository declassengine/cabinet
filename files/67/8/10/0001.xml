(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.W.P.(G)(40)  810. COPY NO.  6 O7th AUGUST, 1940.W A R        CABINET,gJUgT, ON FOOD. PRODUCTION CP MILITARY ANDAIR PREPARATIONS AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY*0F INVASION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,1* I wish to offer some observations on the Memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries  (WoP0(G)(40)  206)of 3rd August about the effect on food production of Militaryand Air preparations against the possibility of invasion.2. At various times since the menace of invasion became a real one the attention of the Military Authorities has been drawn, both in letters from Headquarters, Home Forces, and ia]letters from Sir Findlater Stewart, Chief Civil   Staff Officdjto the Commander&quot;in-Chief, to the necessity that the Militaryshould observe commonsense, restraint and courtesy in their tdealings with the agriculturists,,      I would not deny that therehave been instances in which subordinate officers have notfollowed these precepts in practice;   but if concrete instances of abuse are brought to the notice of the Military Authoritiesprompt investigation will be made and,  if the alleged abuse isauthenticated, disciplinary action will be taken.3. In the last few weeks the issue had been, to someextent, complicated by the fact that a campaign for theobstruction of potential enemy landing grounds was inauguratedunder the auspices of the Civil Authorities, i.e., the regional Commissioners acting through the medium of borough councils, Local District Councils, etcAs a result, however, of an answer given by the lord privy Seal in the House of Commons on Friday, 2nd August (acopy of which is attached as Annex l) it has been decided thatthe ultimate responsibility for the direction and planning ofall obstructions shall rest with the Service authorities concerned,.Service Authorities will consult with the localAgriculmaral Committees but I must insist on the full recog-nition of the principle that the orders of the MilitaryAuthorities are paramount in matters of defence0At various t imes instructions about the size of fieldsto be obstructed, the type of obstacle to be used and so forth,have been sent to the Air Force, the Army and the civil authorities,      The instructions are now in process of beingconsolidated;    when the agreement of all concerned - Air Ministry,

Home Forces, the War Office, the Ministry of home security and the Ministry of Agriculture - has been secured,    they will receive a wide distribution toall concernedo4. As I have said above, it is not possible merely by sending out orders to ensure that they areintelligently interpreted in every instance, but itis the policy of the Military Authorities to dealseverely with any authenticated contraventions of their orders which may be brought to their notice5. With regard to the Minister of Agriculture&apos;desire   that the vital role of agriculture shall berecognised, I do not think that there is any difference of policy between him and myself.;      He will agree that,in the last resort. Military necessities must beparamount, just as i recognise that the maintenanceof agriculture is one of our most vital services atthe present time,.,     As instances of the fact that theMilitary recognise the point of view of the agricul-turist I would cite the fact that instructions havebeen sent to Commanders that livestock has not, asa general ruley to be evacuated from coastal areas and   only to be slaughtered as a last resort, thatin any defence works likely to affect drainage works the Catchment Authorities are to be taken into full consultation and that agriculturists are not to becalled on to carry out Local Defence Volunteer duties which would interfere with their work for agriculture.The preparation of this country against attack must inevitably involve some interference with agriculturespread as it is over a vastly greater area than anyother industry but,., allowing for the admitted mistakesthat have occurred in certain Instances, I am confident that the issue of the consolidated instructions towhich   I have referred will remove the grounds forcomplaint by agriculturists while ensuring that thereIs no interference with essential defence measures.My colleagues will recall that our defence arrangements had to be carried through at high speedat a time of grave emergency.     Errors were no doubtcommitted, but the defences were built and this wasthe   paramount need of the hour.     Had we failed topress forward with this work with all speed, evenrunning the risk of mistakes here and there, we shouldhave failed in our dutyDI should like to take this opportunity ofmaking it plain that as a general rule the militaryauthorities   have received most helpful and under-standing co-troops^abion from all the Departments onthe home front(Intld.)     AcEo&quot;War Office.7th August    1940,,Sichmond Terrace.. So&apos;./,l.7th Augusts 1940,

MR. do ROTHSCHILD asked the Prime Minister who is responsiblefor carrying out measures to render agricultural land proof against landing by enemy aircraft;whether it is the &quot;War Office;    the Air Ministry;the rural district councils the parish council, orwhether it Ls left to members of the Home Guard; and what steps aro being taken by whichever authority is responsible to consult with the Ministry ofAgriculture- on this matter? in order to ensure that measures are taken which are not likely to impair the productivity of the land? as in many districtsagricultural land has already had its food producingpotentialities seriously reduced as a result of the ill-advised methods of protection which have beenadopted?MR. ATTLEE:    The position has boon reviewed,  and for the future the ultimate responsibility for the obstruction of possible enemy landing grounds will be divided between the Army and the Royal Air Force.    Each ofthese authorities has its sphere of action clearly defined.    The work will?  so far as possible? becarried out by the Army and the Royal -^ir Forceauthorities themselves? or by contractors working under tneir direction.    Should they require anyaddition to their labour force, it would be suppliedeither by voluntary labour? or by paid labour? bothof which would be under the auspices of the localauthority;    but the planning of the work would be under the general direction of the Service authorities.I wish to make it clear that civilian authorities willnot undertake any works of obstruction which are not covered by the particular or general instruction  ofthe Service authorities.    A strict instruction to consult with the County,War Agricultural ExecutiveCommittee has been issued? and it has been impressed upon those responsible that? subject to over-ridingmilitary necessity? fullest consideration must begiven for the preservation of our agriculture.MR. GRANVILLE;    Will the individual farmers have an opportunityof giving their advice as to where obstacles shouldbe put in their fields? particularly during the harvest season?MR. A BEVAN:    Is the right hem. Gentleman aware that all over thecountry farmers have almost entirely ignored theinstructionsoMRS. TATE;        That is absolutely untrue.MR. BE VAN t__and that it is only necessary to go ona short car journey? or to look out of any railwaycompartment window?  to see fields in which there areno obstructions?MR. de ROTHSCHILD: Willxthe Lord Privy Seal institute anarrangement whereby the Ministry of Agriculture willbe  represented by a person who will go round the

fields and see that agriculture is respectedand that the productivity of the land is notin any way reduced;    and is he aware that theagricultural..committees as at present constituted are composed of farmers who haveno authority in relation to the military andair authorities;    and is it not essentialthat a representative of the Ministry ofAgriculture should be consulted?ME. ATTLEEt Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will put that point to the Service Ministries concerned.The arrangement at present is that the orders of the military authorities must be paramountin matters of defence9 but they are instructedto consult with the local agricultural committees.    I cannot think that it would bepossible to have a representative of theMinistry of Agriculture dealing with individual cases all over the country.SIR J. LAMB: Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that large numbers of farmers have been visitedby inspectors and forced by them to take their men from the work of cultivation to erect the obstacles, and to whom are theyto apply for compensation?MR. ATTLEE:      I ask the hon. Member to put the question on the Order Paper.
