1,    Soon after the enemy started dropping mines on land in the london area, it was decided, largely at the instance of the Admiralty and theMinistry of Home Security, that public reference to this new form of attack- would be undesirable,0,    By now, the reasons for complete secrecy have lost their force andcertain references to the new use to which the enemy has put thisjeapon have, in the meantime, found their way into the Press.     A gooddeal of information on the subject has probably also reached neutral countries by channels which censorship cannot control.5.    In these circumstances, we consider it desirable to issue an -fficial statement for the guidance of the Press, while at the same time^ &apos;giving the censorship directions which will ensure the continued secrecy of those aspects of this form of attack and of our counter measureshich, in our opinion, ought to be kept from the enemy.     We accordinglysk for approval to issue immediately the draft statement annexed tohis memorandum,f    Thereafter, we should propose to allow the Press a free hand inealing with this subject, with the proviso that the censorship shoulde instructed to prevent the publication of the following information(a) That many of the mines have failed to explode,(b) That these mines which have exploded have often had avery severe effect,(c) The exact localities in which mines fell and their effect upon transport and communications.(d),   Anything which betrays our knowledge of the nature ofthe mechanism and the methods which are used to render it harmless:    this prohibition to include any referenceto the fact that Naval personnel have been engaged onthis task,* The technical officers of the Admiralty consider that mines shouldot be referred to as mines in the press statement,* , We suggest that the censorship authorities should consult theJniralty and the Ministry of Home Security before permitting theblication of any material which presents a border-line case underhese instructions.HsMoA.V.A.kp.fG&quot;)(40) 288,- COPY NO._;_j6th November, 1940,WAR    CABINET.Publicity with regard to.

The German Governments through its official statements and air raid commUniques; is-repeatedly at pains to deny that german air attack $n this country is mainly based on terrorisationAf the civil population by random and indiscriminate bombingPtf towns and cities and of rUral districts.Many facts have for some time disproved the Germancontention, notably the height from which their bombs arereleased, especially at night, which makes aimed bombing withany degree of accuracy impossible, and also the fact that bombs are repeatedly dropped at random through thick cloud whichrenders the ground invisible from the air.The Germans themselves, however, have completely destroyedtheir own case.     This they have done by the wanton use on land of a 3q$a*b: which in the first place is the largest size theycould compass, and secondly is impossible to aim at, or to direct to, any particular targetsThese missiles are dropped by parachute.     They have been seen descending.     These parachutes, or their caps, moreover werenot entirely destroyed by the explosions.     Hence their naturecould be clearly established.Being released in this way from great heights, in windssometimes as strong as forty miles an hour, aiming is impossible.The borafas did in fact fall at random in urban districts, doingdamage -to house property and oausing loss of life to civilians.The savagery of such attack needs no emphasis.The people of this country themselves know better thananyone, that this barbarous weapon has utterly failed in its object of terrorism.     To complete the picture, it can be addedthat its effects on war production have been insignificant.
