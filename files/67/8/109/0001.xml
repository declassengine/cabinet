Category,  that is,  the category of persons who before Junej19^0, were exempted from internment but not exempted from the special restrictions applicable to enemy aliens.      There was no genera],internment of German and Austrian women in the C. Category, and therewas no general  internment of Italian women.      (The only Italian womeninterned are some 17 against whom there was special information).Amongst the German and Austrian women who have been interned becausethey were originally placed In the B. Category there are no doubt some&apos;vho could safely be released.      Their cases are at present under reviewa special Committee in the Isle of Man under the Chairmanship of theChief Magistrate of the Metropolitan Police Courts, Sir Robert Dummett,ind they are being released unless this Committee finds that there is such doubt about their loyalty that it is necessary to continue theirdetention,5- The main problem concerning the men internees amongst whom thereare many known or believed to be friendly to the Allied cause.

his cause there is no reason to doubt.      On the other hand any measures0r the release on an extensive scale of these aliens may be regarded as-ejudicial to security.      Last week the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committeebmitted to the Chief of Staffs, and the^Chief of Staffs referred to thedme Defence Security Executive,  the following recommendations :-&quot;(a)     That there should be no relaxation of the principles and regulations under which the internment of aliens was originallycarried out.      In all cases where aliens are released from internment the ruling f actcr.. must always be the security andmilitary needs of the country;(b)     That the number and categories of aliens at large shouldbe periodically reviewed with the object of putting every possible obstacle in the way of the establishment by the enemy of agents in this country;(d)      That due publicity should be given to the underlyingreasons for the continued internment of large numbers of1   aliens.&quot;The problem of trying to reconcile security considerations with the equitable treatment of aliens who are friendly to our cause has beenery carefully studied by the Asquith Committee..     This Committeeecently submitted to me a report on a recommendation made by the Lyttonouncil to the effect that there should be released persons &quot;who canreduce evidence sufficient to satisfy a tribunal that they are soriendly towards this country and so sympathetic towards the allied causehat they can safely be released without prejudice to the national interest&quot;.      The Asquith Committee say that they entirely agree thatbrsons proved to be friendly to this country should not be kept innternment.      &quot;We think this principle is equitable and indeednexceptionable.      The crux of the matter lies in the word &apos;proved&apos;&quot;.he Asquith Committee point out that if a tribunal were appointed toply such a test of loyalty as the Lytton  Council    suggest, the majoritythose interned would claim to pass it,  and that it would need 10ribunals working 5 days a week for the best part of a year to examine11 the applicants.      Even if the practical difficulties of constitutinguitablc tribunals and enabling them to function could be surmounted,  thesquith Committee conclude that the results would be quite disproportionateo the labour involved.     Probably after this lengthy and laboriousinvestigation only a small proportion of the aliens would be able toischarge the onus of proof suggested by the Lytton Council.The Asquith Committee point out,&apos; however, that there are alreadyn the White Paper categories of eligibility for release based directlyp indirectly on a loyalty test and that these categories cover a largeercentage of the internees.      In addition to those who are.eligible forelease under Category 19 ( i..o. , persons who over a period of years haveaken a public and prominent part in Opposition to the Nazi system,  etc.)r under Category 22 (i.e., persons who have lived for at least 20 yearsn the United Kingdom and can show that their interests and associations?e British and that they are friendly towards this country), there is aird category more important as regards numbers than any other, namely,Jategory 12, which covers all internees who are accepted for enlistmentjn the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps.Hitherto only about ly7fp men have offered to enlist and this isQt a large proportion of tne eligible men.      The Asquith Committeeonsider that many may be hanging back in the expectation that there maye some enlargement of the categories which will enable them to claimelease without joining this Corps,  and they recommend &apos;that steps should.e taken to dispel this idea.The Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps is open to men between theges of 18 and 50.      As regards men who are over the age of 50 or are/rejected

rejected on medical grounds for the A.M.P.C.,  the Asquith CommitteeFl0y that the numbers of such men would probably be not more than 2,000aiid that the examination of 2,000 cases by a Tribunal is uracticable.n-jiey accordingly recommend that there should be a new category oflligibility for release covering &quot;any male person who has reached hisfiftieth birthday or who, having applied for enlistment in the A.M.P.C.,has been rejected on medical grounds, and in regard to whom a tribunalappointed by the Secretary of State for the purpose reports that he is opposed to the Nazi system and is actively friendly towards the allied cause, and the tribunal is satisfied that he will remain steadfasttowards that cause in all circumstances&quot;.Effect could be given to this proposal by enlarging the terms ofreference of the tribunals which already deal (a) with Germans and austrians and (b) with Italians who claim to have been prominentopponents to the Nazi or Fascist regime or to have been resident in theUnited Kingdom for 20 years and to be friendly towards this country.7.     I am at the present moment having an occupational census taken ofall internees with a view to picking out and releasing from internmentthose who are qualified to undertake specialist work for which thereis a shortage of skilled workers, provided of course there is nosecurity objection   to   release    in any individual cases.      Thisarrangement,  combined with the existing arrangements set out in theWhite Paper for the release of scientists,  research workers, and so on,will provide,  generally speaking, for the release of such internees a shave special qualifications of which the best use could not be made inthe A*M,P,C.      As regards the remainder,  I think the proper course is,as suggested by the Advisory Committee, to expect that those who arefriendly to this country and anxious to help the war effort will offerthemselves for enlistment.      If they do not do so, there can,  I think,be little ground for complaint about their continued detention,,I propose,  therefore,  to adopt the recommendation of the AsquithCommittee as regards men over 50 and men who are medically unfit for theA.M.P.C. , and when announcing the scheme for allowing such men to come before a tribunal to make it clear that the Government does not contemplate any further enlargement of the categories of eligibility for release;    so that those who are eligible for the A.M.P.C and arehesitating to enlist in the hope that they may secure release by someother method will recognise that the best way of demonstrating their(friendliness to this country is to join this Corps.I should hope that if amongst the aliens who have joined theA,i:,P.C. ,  or may join it in the future,  there are persons whose special qualifications would make them more useful in some civil employment,the Military Authorities v/iil be willing to pick out and discharge such persons for such employment.R.     It is important that the policy to be adopted towards aliens ofGerman, Austrian and Italian nationality should be understood and accepted by the Military Authorities,      If these authorities areuneasy about the alien position,  their uneasiness spreads in widecircles and creates alarm amongst the general public.      At the presenttime the vocal elements of public opinion are in favour of a more liberal policy, but the elements which are at present vocal represent only a part of the public,  and there is always a risk that at any time &quot; public excitement caused, for example, by intensive bombing or a threat of immediate invasion, the oendulum may swing the other way.9.     It must not be overlooked that there is an element of danger inreleasing from internment persons for whom satisfactory arrangementsfor their maintenance and accommodation cannot be made;      Many of the internees lived in areas now declared to be aliens protected areas andthe return of large numbers of them to important military areas will inevitably give rise to a sense of disquiet.      Nor would it be asatisfactory solution from the point of vie.&quot; of national security to release any considerable number&apos;of internees who have no prospect of/obtaining

(obtaining useful employment but would use up both living and shelter(accommodation urgently required for our own people.Subject, therefore,  to the approval of the War Cabinet I would3ropose to make a statement in the House of Commons indicating that thegovernment unreservedly accept the principle that aliens should be released whoso loyalty to the Allied Cause is demonstrable, pointingDUt the difficulties of giving practical effect to this principle as[shown by the careful study of the Asquith Committee, announcing the new scheme for men over fifty and medically unfit for the A.M.P.C., andknowing that as regards the remainder those who are friendly to the[llied Cause can secure release under the existing and proposed arrangements,  including the arrangement for admission to the A.M.P.C.A copy of the White Paper is attached.H.M,20th November, 19U0o
