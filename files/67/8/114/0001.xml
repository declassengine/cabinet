MEMORANDUM AGREED BETWEEN THE AIR MINISTRY AND THE MINISTRY OPINFORMATION.1. Great difficulty has teen experienced in definingprinciples by which to decide when to permit publication inthe Press or by wireless of damage inflicted by enemy air raids.The difficulty has partly been in dealing fairly with theprovinces in comparison with London, but mainly in reconciling,particularly In the London area, the conflicting claims in individual cases of security and publicity,       So many and various have been the objectives damaged in these raids that decisions in individual cases to release items inevitably resultin logically irresistible claims for the release of other news.In the result,  in the view of the Air Ministry, concurred in bythe Censorship Division, it is probable that we have releasedtoo much in that the enemy has obtained information useful tohim.2 In addition to the difficulty of defining principles bywhich the censorship ought to be guided there has been difficultyin working out a practice which will avoid unnecessaryinequalities and leave to the Departments concerned their properresponsibilities.3. The follov/ing principles and practice have now been agreed with the Air Ministry i(i)     The policy of prohibiting mention in the Press or B.3.C.of particular objectives hit in air raids will be firmlyadhered to and will be departed from only in reallyexceptional caseso(ii)     The duty of applying this policy and of deciding uponproper exceptions from it should be performed by the censorship at the Ministry of Information with theassistance of the Air Advisers to the Censorship.     the performance of this duty by the Censorship does notderogate from the right of the Air Ministry to the &quot;lastword&apos; on a question of security;    nor does it preventthe Air Ministry placing an absolute ban on some particularobjective, if they consider that security requires it.(iii) The Censorship should pursue a policy of &quot;scrambling&quot;in releasing objectives; that is, releases will be made atvarying intervals of days after the event but withoutindicating the nature of the interval.      In any event norelease will be made until 4 days after the damage hasoccurred, unless there has been an official Air ministry and Ministry of Home Security Communique specificallymentioning the objective hit.(iv) The Ministry of Information should take steps to seethat the policy to be adopted is made known to the press and that such explanation as it is reasonably safe togive is afforded to the public.(v) The Ministry of Information should further endeavourto arrange with the Press a more satisfactory method ofreporting damage to objectives which are not released.For instance, circumlocutions which give away the placedescribed to a large number of people, and references toanonymous hospitals and schools which cause needlessagitation and distress to many people, ought to be avoided.

4. The essential feature is that in the working of the censorship the Chief Press Censor should make the decisions.The present state of confusion is largely due to ad hocdecisions toy higher authorities, decisions reasonable enough in themselves when individually considered, tout having effects on other cases not foreseen or envisaged toy those who order therelease of a particular otojective damaged.

AIR RAID DAMAGE1*   The general rule is that mention should not &quot;be made in the Press ofparticular places damaged or destroyed or of the spots where bombs havefallen so long as the news is recent enough to matter. This general rule isworked out as follows .   No place where bombs have fallen is to be mentioned in such a way as to identify it for 28 clear days after the date of the event except(i) if a place of exceptional interest or importance is involved anywhere in the country, the Censorship may release it -vri.tb.in a few days so longas the actual date of the occurrence is not mentioned^   The period ofdays allowed will be deliberately varied;(ii) where places of business have been damaged or destroyed and it isnecessary in the interests of the business to give notice of the fact,the notice may appear in the Press after 10 clear days have elapsed,provided that no date is given.   This liberty does not apply to any1&apos;works or factory of national importance, damage to which must not be mentioned in the Press.   Any doubt on this point should he referred tothe Censorship for advice.,   In very exceptional cases the Censorship may give a release under the 10 days, if the advertisement is submitted.3.   When 28 clear days have elapsed any particular place damaged or injuredmay be mentioned without submission to Censorship unless it is a&apos;militaryobjective or the place has only suffered one raid within the period.Military objectives should not be mentioned at all: places which have suffered only a single raid should not be rentioned without the approval ofthe Censorship which may be withheld in exceptional casesoA military objective means any Dockyard, Naval, Military, Air Force orother Government establishment, munition factory or other factory engaged on work of national importance, railway, dock^ shipyard, bridge, railway ortransport station, waterworks, reservoir, sewage works, electricity stationor transmission line, mine, oil installation or gasworks,,If an Editor is in doubt as to whether a particular place which hedesires to mention ought to be regarded as a military objective or not, heshould submit the matter for the advice of the Censorship on the point.ij-.   At no time may the actual dates when damage was caused be given: and at no time should Editors print, without the approval of the Censorship,catalogues of damage in any particular town or area or of damage to particular classes of buildings in a defined area.
