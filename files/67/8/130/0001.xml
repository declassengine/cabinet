7TS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)?0RET. AjCToU40) 550. COPY NO. pfriJDe c emb e r. 1940 war    CABINET.IMPROVED STREET LIGHTING.Memorandum by trie Minister of Home Security.At the meeting on the 25th October, the War Cabinet  (W.M.(40)277th Conclusions Minute 6) agreed that a Circular should not beissued to local authorities, but that I should ascertain theirviews on the matter by personal &quot;consultation.      I have accordingly been in touch with the three Associations of local authorities concerned, the Association of Municipal Corporations, the urban district Councils Association, and the Association of Cities of CountiesinScotland.      The view of the members of the Associations representinglocal authorities in England, is that during the present period of intensive air activity, it would be undesirable to introduce.any system of improved street lighting.      In the case of the urban district Councils, some doubt is expressed whether, even under more normal conditions, local authorities would be prepared to. undertake the additional expenditure.As regards Scotland, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are opposedto any improvement on the ground of the risk involved, but in Glasgowthe matter is still under consideration^I had already ascertained that as regards London, the borough councils would be opposed to the scheme, both from the point of view of safety and of expense.The War Cabinet also invited me to take such steps as were possible to proceed with preparatory measures, without howeverincurring any substantial expenditure.      In view of the decision to defer any Circular to local authorities,  it has not been possible todo more than complete the full scale test at Paisley referred to inmy previous memorandum (W.P.(G) (40.) 272,    Observation was limited by weather conditions to one occasion only, but this showed thatthe experimental lighting installed at Paisley was not visible atmore than 8 miles at 5,000 to 6,000 feet.      So far as it went,this air observation confirmed the theoretical calculations supplied to the Black-out Committee,      The intensity of the lighting was ofthe order recommended by the Black-out Committee  (i.e. of the orderof .02 foot candle), and the visibility was within the limit of15 miles which that Committee considered to be necessary.In the absence of information as to probable requirements considered that it would be premature to take up the question of theproduction of the necessary lighting fittings,In view of the continuance of intensive enemy air activity, andof the views of the local authorities,  I am forced to the conclusion       \that it would be undesirable to attempt to obtain any improvement of street lighting during the present winter.      There is no doubt, fromthe representations which reach me, that the public attach the gratest value to the maintenance of as complete a black-out as possible,and there have in certain cases been demands for the extinction of even the present &quot;star&quot; lighting in streets.      I would also point
out that unless-a--decision were taken now to authorise, the improved lighting,  it would not he practicable to get the lighting installed before the end of the winter.I recommend therefore, that this matter should now be deferred until next summer, when it can be reconsidered in thelight of the conditions then obtaining.H.M.
