THTfl DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GQVg^lOCT.ORET.CEPY NOcSeptember, 1940.WAR    CABINET.BRITISH MISSION TO SOUTH AMERICA.Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping.The request for a British ship to be placed at the disposal of this mission has been discussed between my Department and the Department of overseas Trade who say that ships in port in South America are a centre of social life in a way unknown in this country and that if the Mission is toserve its purpose, a first class ship must be used and that nothing short ofa Blue Star ship would do, if there were no better ship available.   It isessential, in their view, that the Mission should cover all the countries inSouth -America including Columbia and Venezuela in the Spanish Main and thatit should begin its work in the more important countries on the East Coast.The Department of Overseas Trade state that there is no air or complete railservice from the East Coast to the West, i.e, from Buenos Aires to Valparaisoor between the various countries in the West and the North, and the Missionmust therefore have a ship at its disposal for the whole journey -which vrauldoccupy about four months in all.The &quot;ALMEDA STAR&quot; is available in this country to sail on the14th September.   Her gross tonnage is 14,935 and her passenger accommodation is 150 first class.     According to the owners, her speed is 15 knots.If this ship is used, she will nave to be held for the purpose and theMinister of Food will lose an importing capacity of some 11/15,000 tons inrefrigerated space.     The ship will in fact be carrying no cargo at all.As regards cost, it may be assumed that the &quot;Almeda Star&quot; would run notless than  150,000 for four months.The question whether the vessel should be escorted during her voyagehas been raised direct with the Admiralty. 1 am, however, bound to urge that no escorts should be withdrawn from the regular convoys for this purpoE...Apart from the actual loss of carrying capacity for the ship itself, ithas to be remembered that the passenger carrying fleet has been depleted bylosses and by heavy requisitions both for service as armed merchant cruisers and other essential naval purposes and for the trooping programme to theMiddle East which are making it necessary drastically to interfere with thenormal sailings.There is also a yet unmet demand by the Admiralty for fast oceanboarding vessels amounting to about a dozen vessels out of a total of twenty.Losses generally at the present time are severe.In short there is no margin of tonnage of the requisite type for thispurpose and the allocation of a special ship to the Trade Mission can onlybe effected at the direct expense of the trooping programme or urgent navalrequirements, or, if. they have to be met in full, by withdrawing yet anothership from importing service.
Its has to be borne in mind that the Ministry of Shipping maybe called upon during the coming months to carry more troops to theMiddle East than is now contemplated.    Owing to the length of the voyage this can only be done by making serious inroads into our commercial programme.We have urged our Allies, and they have well responded, to putall their fine and fast vessels at our disposal for essential carryingtrades and it may strike them unfavourably if we now detail one of ourown for a prolonged propogandist mission.The War Cabinet are aware of the difficulties in meeting essentialdemands for shipping and I feel unable to authorise the allocation of alarge refrigerated ship for so long a period for such a purpose withouta deoision from the War Cabinet, taken with a knowledge of all thecircumstances.RoHoCoMinistry of Shipping.10th September 1940.
