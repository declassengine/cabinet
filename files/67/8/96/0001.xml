w.p. (g. ) (AQ) 296013TH NOVEMBER,  1940 iWAR CABINET.INDUSTRY TO SUPPORT THE PRESENT SERVICEPRO GRAMMES.Note by the Chairman of the production council and the Economic Policy Committee,At a joint meeting held yesterday afternoon, theProduction Council and the Economic Policy Committee had under consideration:(a) a report by the Man Power requirements committee on the numbers required in theengineering industry in February,  1941 and      JAugusts  1941 respectively,  in order to supportthe present Service programmesj(b) a note by the Chairman of the Man power requirements Committee    indicating the actionwhich would require to be taken if the .necessary increases in the engineering industry were to &quot;be achieved by these dates.2. The Committee estimated the needs of the supply departments, of Exports and Home Consumption as follows:-

In presenting the report the Chairman, Sir william beveridge, drew attention to the following conditions:-(i)    the Military programme requires a net additionin 16 months to December, 1941, of 1,741,000men of military age and about 75,000 women tothe Defence Services;sThe Admiralty made a Reservation in the report to the effectthat in their view the figures 1+22 and 455 respectivelywould be nearer the mark.

(ii)    the Munitions Programme requires a netaddition in 12 months from August, 19A0,to August, 191+1, of 700,000 people to thelabour force in the engineering and alliedindustries, with a transfer of another100,000 from engineering production for thehome market,  and with a possible furtheraddition up to 275,000 in these industriesif there is serious land fighting;(iii)    in addition to the numbers required in engineering and allied industries therewill be needed for filling ammunition by august, 191+1,  an additional 100,000 work-people, with a further 75,000 if there is serious land fighting;(iv) having regard to the other calls on maleman-power it is likely that more than halfthe additional 800,000 in.engineering and allied industries, and filling, and nearly all the possible addition of 350,000required in the event of serious fighting inthose industries or in filling ammunitionmust be women;(v) the number of men proposed to be withdrawnfrom industry in the four Defence Servicestogether to the end of 191+1 is a million and three quarters less than the totalnumber withdrawn in the last war, when thenumber of men of military age was a million less;(vi) the full demand for women in munitions(assuming serious fighting) by August, 191+1;is 800,000,  as compared with 700,000 womenundertaking munitions work in the last war;(vii) the required increase in engineering and allied industries in 12 months to August,19^+1,  is more than twice that achievedunder incomparably easier conditions in 12months before.      Much more than half ofthis total increase is required in thefirst six month to February, 191+1, ofwhich two months have passed already.A.. Sir William Beveridge indicated that in hisopinion the practical problems involved were the following:-(a)     realsiation of the Military and MunitionsProgrammes depends on solution of fourpractical problems relating respectively toa)  supply of skilled men;    (b)  supply of semi-skilled and unskilled   men and women;(c) obtaining men for Defence Serviceswithout stopping other essential work;    (d)maintenance of output per head under conditions of aerial attack;

2fj f-l(d)    the general problem of skilled men in engineering must he solved, and can be solved, by dilution, enabling every threeskilled men to cover the ground formerlycovered by four such men.      Dilution tothis extent is practicable but must be general.      The whole labour force in theengineering industry must be treated asa single pool;(c) within the general problem of skilled labour is the problem of two special classesof skilled toolmakers and machine setters,forming the hard core of the man-power problem.The probable requirement for these is135,000 as compared with a visible supplyof about 90,000.      This problem can be solved only by up-grading within the factories.      There must at the same time be the maximum of economy in the use ofsuch men by avoidance of every avoidablechange or variety of design, and everyavoidable discontinuity or multiplicationof contracts;(d) the limits of transfer of engineers fromother work to munitions work have beennearly reached and even the closing down of engineering and exports would not bring us within sight of a solution;(e) 575,000 of the additional force of 700,000required in engineering will need trainingor experience before they can produce.The Ministry of Labour with its presentequipment and programme cannot traindirectly (in Government training centresor technical institutions) by August, 1941,more than about 130?000 persons,  some ofwhom the employers will then want to train further.      Four-fifths of thetraining in addition to up-grading must-he given in the factories, but the government through the Ministry of Labour must see thatthis training is given;(f) the additional force, mainly women, has tobe fitted into the existing engineeringoccupations, now mainly filled by men.This involves a revolutionary change inthe practice of most managements;- h -

(g) the training scheme of the Ministry must herelated to the occupations required and to v/hatthe employers may he doing;    there is risk ofa glut of male fitters later;(h) the additional labour force has to work inspecified places.      For the staffing of each new factory there must be a definite plan worked out in advance to fill it with semi-skilled and unskilled labour as it gets ready to go into production, and to overcome in turn everydifficulty, as it arises, of housing and transport and life outside the factory;(i)    new factories should be located with primaryregard to the supply of labour;(j)   provision of men for the Defence Services willprobably involve the calling up of most of theyoung men of 18 and 19 and,  in addition,substantial revision of the schedule of reserved occupations, depriving industries of men hithertotreated as indispensable.      Haing regard to this the additional men drawn into engineering may need to be largely over hO;(k)    to keep the loss of output per head throughinterruptions by aerial attack down to theirreducible minimum is an objective of first-rate importance.      The Government, with thisobject, must directly undertake both provisionfor the maximum security of the workmen in thefactory and for his needs (transport,  sleep,food and ease of mind as regards his family)outside the factory.      Every front line needs anArmy Service Corps.5. The joint meeting of the Production Counciland the Eeonomic Policy Committee agreed:-(l) that the Report of the Man Power requirements committee and the proposals for action thereonrelating to dilution, the recruitment of women,large scale training in factories, etc.,  submittedby the Chairman of the Committee provided abasis for action and should be adopted,   and:-(a) that the measures required to give effectto these proposals should be put in handforthwith;(b) that the scheme depended for its successon the whole hearted co-operation of allthe Government Departments concerned;

(c) that the Minister of Labour should forthwith approach the EmployersFederation and the Trade Unions inthe Engineering industry in orderto secure their full and immediateco-operation;(2)     to invite the Man Power requirements committee to continue their investigationswith a view to submitting further proposals;(3)      to take note:-(a) of the assurances of the Minister ofSupply, the First Lord of theAdmiralty, the President of theBoard of Trade and the Minister ofLabour that,  subject to any minor adjustments which might be foundnecessary on points of detail, thefullest co-operation of their respective departments will be forthcoming in giving practical effect to themeasures referred to above;(b) that the Minister of Aircraft Prodctionwould state his point of view at theWar Cabinet;(L)      to invite the Minister without Portfolioto submit the foregoing conclusions to the War Cabinet for their approval.6. In submitting the foregoing, I should make itclear that what is now desired is that the War cabinet should endorse the Conclusions set out above so that theMinister of Labour can, at once, indicate the necessary action with the knowledge that it represents thepolicy of the War Cabinet and that in carrying thispolicy into effect he can rely on the v/holehearted &apos;co-operation of all the Departments concerned.(Intd.)
