THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC M A.IESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 268.October 18, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PROPOSAL THAT HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT should provide A SITE FOR A MOSQUE IN LONDON.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary ofState for India and the Secretary of State for the Colonies.FOR many years interest has been shown in certain quarters, both in thiscountry and in Moslem countries, in a proposal to construct a mosque in london for the use of the Moslem community and of the many Moslem visitors and students who normally come here every year. The small mosque which already exists at Woking is inadequate in size and too far from London.It has been ascertained that there is now a sufficient body of support for thisproposal and that the necessary funds for the construction of a mosque (about 250,000) would be forthcoming from Moslem sources within and outside theEmpire, if a site could be provided by His Majesty&apos;s Government. There are several sites available, and it is estimated, after consultation with Messrs. Knight,Frank and Rutley, that a suitable site would cost not more than  100,000 and notless than  80,000, and it has been suggested that the good impression which theprovision of a site by His Majesty&apos;s Government would make upon Moslemopinion throughout the world would be well worth the sum involved.In order to fortify this suggestion, His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Cairo,Bagdad and Jedda and several other authorities who know the East and the moslem world well were consulted, and the balance of the opinions which they expressed was found to be definitely in favour of the proposal. It was pointedout, inter alia, not only that London contains more Moslems than any other european capital, but that in an Empire which actually contains more Moslemsthan Christians it was anomalous and inappropriate that there should be nocentral place of worship for Mussulmans. The gift, moreover, of a site for amosque would serve as a tribute to the loyalty of the Moslems of the Empire andwould have a good effect on Arab countries of the Middle East.In these circumstances, we strongly recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should, if possible, provide a sum for the acquisition of a site for a mosquein London say, a sum not exceeding  100,000. His Majesty&apos;s Government could then inform the Moslem promoters of the proposal that they are prepared toprovide a site on which the construction of a mosque can begin as soon as thenecessary funds have been contributed and conditions in the building trade allow.H.L.
