sjTpfftJMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .SECRET.y,P.(fl), 40 215*------------ ^29th October. 1940. -     COPY NO. _.WAR CABINET.AIR RAID SHELTER POLICY.Memorandum hy the Minister of Home Security;1.      I have in the near future to make a public statement upon thepolicy of the Government in regard to air raid shelters.      Sinceassuming office it has been one of my principal tasks to examinehow far, in the light of recent experience and in continuation ofthe work done by my predecessor, existing policy calls for modification or amplification, and I am anxious to put myconclusions before the War Cabinet .in order to obtain theirendorsement before making any pronouncement.2.     The general considerations which have hitherto governed theconstruction of shelters are(a) that raids would be comparatively short and sheltersmust consequently he readily accessible and need noihe provided with elaborate amenities;(b) that shortage of time and materials precluded large scale construction of shelters which would be proofagainst a direct hit.3.      Prolonged night raiding has, however, led certain sections ofthe public to seek shelter, irrespective of warnings, towardsnight-fall and stay there until the morning.      This has not onlyput an immense strain on the capacity of the shelters but hasraised many fresh problems.      In these circumstances, accessibilityceases to he a criterion.     Many people will travel long distancesto reach shelters which they specially favour, sometimes without proper regard to the reality of the protection afforded.      some people prefer the Tube stations and other large shelters whichare cheerfully crowded and free from the noise of the raids to thesmaller brick and concrete shelters, and direct hits on the latterhave of course become more widely known than hitsi on sheltersunder buildings.    As a result there has been considerable over-crowding in shelters notwithstanding the fact that the public hasbehaved extraordinarily well.4.     To remedy the situation,action has been taken and is continuingon the following lines(a) To increase the comfort of all shelters hy providingbunks, lighting, improved sanitary arrangements and,in the case of larger shelters, arrangements for control and for medical assistance.(b) To popularise the small shelters hy the provision ofthe same amenities, by publicity and if necessary by insisting on families keeping to those shelters whichhave been allotted to them,(c) To reduce the numbers in the over-populated sheltersby dispersal and by issuing tickets for reserved places.(d) To increase the amount of shelter as much as possible,

Extensivedevelopments in this direction must inconveniencepresent occupiers but it will naturally be my object toreduce this to a minimum.5t     These are palliative measures which can be carried outwithin the scope of the present policy.      I have also considered whether a departure from the existing policy infavour,of more heavily protected or deep shelters is called for.6.     The considerations which, as I have indicated, have hithertogoverned shelter policy are not now-entirely valid.     Inparticular the difficulty of providing &quot;adequate,, access to deepshelters, which was an argument upon which Lord Halley&apos; s,-,Conference on shelter policy placed great weight, has ceased&quot;tobe important in places where people spend the whole night insheltersi     We still have, however, to contend with a shortage ofmaterials and we cannot envisage a quicker large-scale programme.Strongly protected shelter must take the form either of deeptunnels or of massive structures of reinforced Concrete aboveground.     In considering whether to adopt these forms of construction, I have had both considerations in mind and I feelthat they rule out the possibility of adopting any widespreadpolicy of deep shelter which would be applied evenly over thevulnerable areas of the country.      I am convinced, however, thatit would not be right merely to dismiss the possibility of deepshelter.     We want as much shelter as possible and we want to get it as quickly as possible, and where natural features or existingconstruction allow deep shelter to be provided quickly it shouldnot be ruled out because it provides a higher standard ofprotection than that already in existence.7*    In London,  I intend to start on a programme of tunnellingwhich would be linked to the Tubes.     I recognise that there aredisadvantages in providing a small amount of first rate shelter,but the Tubes are already being used by some 120,000 people and if,as i have said, the new construction is represented as one phase of the extension of shelter which we are all seeking^ I do notconsider that it would have embarrassing repercussions on otherparts of the shelter programme.     I have been advised by the bestprofessional opinion that in London, subject to satisfactory pro-visioh of labour-, materials and equipment, it would be possilbe within about six months to drive tunnels to hold some 100,000people at a cost of  15 a head.-&apos;     These figures are tentative,but represent, I consider^ a reasonable and practical proposition.8.      In the provinces,  I am advised that there are places wheretunnelling could be carried out with economy in materials, and Ipropose to have all such cases investigated at once With a view toauthorising this form of shelter where it is needed.     Both inLondon and the provinces, new tunnels would, if possible, be driven where they might hereafter be of some use, but I do not want to lose too much time in exploring such possibilities, which are probably limited.9.     I am not yet in a position to pronounce definitely on the praticability of building shelters of massive construction.      Itseems probable however, that they would require ten times theamount of cement and steel per person sheltered than we are nowusing, and it may be that they should be ruled out on these grounds,The same argument applies to what are known as two-stage shelters

which begin with the standard of protectionof existing sheltersbut can be adapted for further.strengthening at a second stage.Without pronouncing Conclusively against such shelters, it .is not clear that they offer any substantial advantages quite apart from the demands that they would make on materials.10.      I ask, therefore, for the approval of my doileagues&apos;for apolicy of providing additional shelter by tunnelling.     InLondon, the construction would be linked to the Tube system.. In the provinces, tunnelling would, be carried out where thereare natural, or other features which lend themselves torapid completion of the work and reasonable economy in materials.MINISTRY OP HOME SECURITY.29th October, 1940.
