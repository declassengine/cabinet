13th October, 1940oSECRET COPY KO.gg.Wo P. (ft) (40)&apos; 264.15th October, 1940,.WAR   CABINET.THE   MEANS   TEST&apos;.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.and the Minister of Health,1*/    We have read with interest the paper on this subject by the Ministerof Labour*   In any such examination as he proposes the household means testas applied in the ease of supplementary payments to old age pensioners would,as he points out, have to be included,,   The supplementary pensions scheme has;now been in operation for two months, and we were collecting reports from thevarious areas with a view to examining the working of the means test as wellas other features of the scheme,,2.     But there are other elements in the situation, in addition to those mentioned in the memorandum which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has circulated.An alteration of the means test for the purpose of unemployment assistance and supplementary pensions would probably provoke a demand for a similar alterationof the law relating to non-contributory old age pensions, since this system is in effect, though not in form, based on a household means test.   Moreover,if by altering the means test the Central Government abandoned the presentsystem as being out of accord with modern sentiment, it would be difficult to resist a popular demand for the extension of the new system to public assistance,though it is more than doubtful whether the public assistance authorities themselves would welcome the additional burden on their rates.3*     Therefore, whilst we agree with the Minister of Labour&apos;s view thatany practicable proposals for a personal means test should be examined forthwith,we urge that all these elements in the problem should be included in the examination,E.B.M.M.
