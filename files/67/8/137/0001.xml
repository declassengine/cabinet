THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1940.SECRET. . Copy No.    5ftW.P. (G) (40) 337.December 27, 1940.WAR CABINET.THE INDIAN POLITICAL SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.IT may be convenient that, at the end of the year, I should submit to theWar Cabinet a brief summary and analysis of the development of the indian political situation since the outbreak of the war.Already before that it was becoming increasingly doubtful whether theAct of 1935, so far as its federal scheme was concerned, could be put into effect.Congress, of course, professed to reject it root and branch as an insult to Indiaand to democracy. But it is, at any rate, possible that, just as it took office inthe Provinces, it might have come in eventually, trusting to its organisation to overcome the weightage given to the States and to the Moslems at the Centre.What was really more serious was that neither the Princes nor the Moslems, once they realised what Congress government meant in the Provinces, were preparedtoenvisage the possibility of Congress domination of a Central Legislature and executive vested with such wide powers of control and interference as was given .to it by the Act.To show its rejection of the constitutional position implied in India&apos;sautomatic participation in the war, the Congress Central Executive, in October1939, called out the Congress Ministries in all the Provinces under its control.Ministers went out very reluctantly, and their going, so far from creatinguniversal indignation, met with general indifference or even mild satisfaction.On the other hand, the method by which they were called out, with its evidenceof the autocratic and irresponsible character of the Congress Executive, onlyintensified Moslem apprehensions and widened that breach between Hindu and moslem which is now the real crux of the whole Indian situation. The clashcame to a head in March with a resolution of the Congress, which reiterated inits extreme form the demand for Indian independence under a constitution tobe framed by a Constituent Assembly elected by universal suffrage, in other words,controlled by the Congress Executive. The Moslem League, which had already-celebrated the resignation of the Congress Ministers by holding a &quot; DeliveranceDay &apos;&apos; on the 22nd December, now for the first time officially put forward the jdemand for the complete breaking-up of India into separate Moslem and Hindunations.From the first the extreme elements in the Congress, led by Mr. JawaharlalNehru, were eager to follow up the resignation of the Congress Ministries byresort to civil disobedience on a formidable scale. Carried out by massdemonstrations, organised on semi-military lines, such a policy, ostensibly directedonly against Government&quot;, would inevitably have led to wholesale clashes with corresponding Moslem organisations, and to something dangerously approachingcivil war over a great part of India. It was the realisation of this danger which no doubt led Mr. Gandhi to exercise such restraining influence as he could exerciseconsistently with his policy of keeping Congress from either breaking upinternally or losing its hold on the public as an active, agitating force. but while the immediate situation remained, to this extent, in uneasy suspense, thegeneral prospect was one of grave anxiety.  The increasing tension bet^en Hindu[22058] W
and Moslem implied no corresponding easing of the situation between either andthe Government. The Congress Left were all for provoking the widest possiblebreach with the Government. The Moslem League, under Mr. JinnaiYs direction,dreaded the possibility of some eventual Government deal with Congress.Prepared, in that case, for a straight fight against Government, it, in themeantime, advised its members not to participate in the provincial and districtWar Committees.In contrast with this progressive deterioration of the political situationpublic opinion in India has throughout been unanimous in its detestation ofNazism and in its desire for our victory. Indeed, the more serious the militarysituation became, the clearer was the realisation of the danger to all India&apos;s hopes of political development, and the more genuine Indian sympathy with us in ouranxieties and Indian admiration of our stubborn resistance. So strong was thewave of emotion throughout India after the collapse of France, and so widespreadthe impatience with the manoeuvres of party leaders, that the Viceroy himselfconcluded that the moment had come for an intervention which might straightenout the situation. Up till then he had been doubtful of the wisdom of making any move in view of the fact that all his patient efforts in October of the preceding year, and again in January, both to meet the Congress view by offering are-examination of the Act of 1935 at the end of the war and by an immediateexpansion of his Executive, as well as to bring the conflicting parties together,had met with no response. His conclusion was endorsed by the War Cabinet inthe shape of the statement issued on the 8th August.That statement embodied both a major declaration of policy with regardto the time and method of India&apos;s future constitutional advance and an immediateconcession to the demand that Indians should take a more direct and responsiblepart in the conduct of the war, in the shape of an expansion of the Viceroy&apos; executive and the formation of an All-India War Advisory Council. This latteroffer was, in fact, both generous and far-reaching, for the collective influence ofa Council with a substantial Indian majority, even if in theory only responsible to His Majesty&apos;s Government, would have been great, and the step, once taken,was irrevocable. But, in substance, it had already been made in the previousOctober, and the only hope that it would be more acceptable in August lay, on theone hand, in the public attitude towards the war and, on the other, in the newbackground created by the wider constitutional declaration. This hope, nevermore than very slender in the case of Congress, came very near realisation in thecase of the Moslems and of the other Hindu parties, but was frustrated, for thetime being at least, by the intransigence of Mr. Jinnah and by the pressure hewas able to bring to bear upon Moslem leaders, who were personally only tooanxious to join in. Without responsible Moslem participation the immediateexpansion of the Council was of dubious advantage. The project was conse-quently dropped, for the time being, to the genuine disappointment of Indianpublic opinion. The offer remains open for reconsideration, but there seems little prospect of such reconsideration in the near future.As an evidence of sectional narrow-mindedness as well as of reluctance to face responsibility the failure of the more immediate offer is regrettable. It is,however, I believe, a relatively minor and temporary issue compared with themore lasting effect upon the whole Indian situation of the major declaration of constitutional policy set out in the Viceroy&apos;s statement. That declaration wasinspired by a twofold purpose. In the first instance its object was to make clear to India and to the world outside the sincerity of our repeated pledges with regardto the goal of British policy in India. It met the constantly reiterated demandfor a constitution framed by Indians for themselves, and left it to Indiansthemselves to secure the attainment of that constitution at the earliest possible moment after the termination of the war. That such a constitution must besubject to certain limitations arising out of our historic connexion with India,more particularly in regard to defence and in consequence to foreign policy, aswell as in regard to our obligations to the Indian States, arises, not so much from a British reluctance to transfer authority, as from the inevitable facts ofthe situation. On the other hand, the statement explicitly laid down that sucha constitution had to be arrived at by agreement between the main elements inIndia&apos;s national life, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared to lend themselves to the coercion of powerful minorities under a constitutiondictated by a mere numerical majority.   This was a categorical rejection of the
Congress demand for a constitution framed by an elected constituent assembly,and a definite assurance to the minorities, and more particularly to the Moslemsand tihe Princes, that they would not be handed over to Congress rule by some future bargain between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Congress leaders.The effect of this was immediate in the decision of the Moslem League toallow its members to take an active part in the War Committees as well as ofthe Khaksars, the dangerous semi-military Moslem organisation, to obey theGovernment orders against military drill and uniforms. It is, indeed, not too much to say that, apart from Congress, our wider declaration of policy has met with approval from every section of Indian public opinion and appreciablystrengthened our moral position.What is more : the whole issue has been shifted to a truer perspective. Thequestion of the transfer of authority has been definitely relegated to its properplace as dependent upon the possibility of finding a constitutional framework forIndia to which authority can be transferred without general anarchy and civil war. For that the responsibility is now primarily laid upon Indians themselves,and, for the first time, Indian political leaders have been put on the defensive inthe eyes of their own public and of the outside world. It should become increasingly clear that we have, in fact, offered all we can offer withoutprecipitating an internal conflict in India which could only end in disaster. Weare now fully justified in &quot; standing pat &quot; on our declared policy, provided alwaysthat we make it clear that we are sincere in our expressed desire to help tobring about agreement in India, and are not merely using existing disagreementas a plea for inaction.It is in this spirit that Lord Linlithgow has again expressed his willingness to help in any movement designed to bring the parties together. For such an effort there is evidently widespread sympathy in India, voiced both by moderateleaders and by the Press, and we should give it every possible encouragement.But it would be a mistake to expect much in the way of positive result in the nearfuture. The principal party leaders are far too much concerned to manoeuvre forposition to be interested in finding a real solution of the constitutional problem.The best hope, indeed, of such a solution would be if a few public spiritedindividuals outside the ordinary party ranks would sit down to the serious study of a uniquely difficult problem and think it out afresh in all its bearings, franklyre-examining not only the basis of representation or the relative powers of theCentre and the units in the federation, but also the even more fundamentalquestion of the suitability of a parliamentary majority executive to Indianconditions. Such a study must, in the first instance, come from Indians them-selves, though it may be doubted whether it will get very far without some initialimpulse from English brains, or come to a final conclusion without some eventualdecisive action by His Majesty&apos;s Government.It is in the iight of the broad effect of our policy upon Indian opinion thatwe should judge the present limited civil disobedience movement launched byMr. Gandhi. It is, in the main, a purely tactical manoeuvre directed against thedisintegrating effect upon the Congress organisation of interest in the war. onthe one hand, and of our policy on the other. It is impossible to judge how far the effort to keep Congress alive by a series of minor martyrdoms of protest islikely to prove effective. Up to the present Indian public opinion seems to havebeen unexpectedly irresponsive, and even the very severe sentence upon Mr. Nehruhas awakened very little real interest. The possibility of serious trouble is alwaysthere. But the Government of India can only go ahead, dealing firmly andpromptly with the direct challenge to its authority, and at the same time retaining the psychological initiative in its own hands, not only by keeping its own positiveconstitutional policy before the Indian public, but also by the vigour, vision andcourage with which it throws itself into the war effort.S L.
