hTHIB DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET .-&apos;fc.toU4Q) -313. COPY NO v1 nth August, 1940,,W A R - 0 A B I NETBritish. Nationality Bill.&quot;Memorandum-by the Home Secretary. .le I circulate a draft of a Bill designed to provide special facilities for the naturalisation of French nationals who are giving their service to the Allied cause, in acaordance with them pledge to General De Gaulle on behalf of the Government, reaffirmedin a letter from the Prime Minister on the 7th instant. ;2. The persons to.whom it is desired to give special facilitiesI to- obtain British nationality,, although they&apos;have not the residence!j qualifications of five years required by the ordinary law, fallI into three categories;-(a)   Frenchmen&apos; who are or nay be serving as-members ofHis Majesty*s Armed Foroes.(b ) Frenchmen who are or may be serving in a french force; recognised by His Majesty, including civiliarpersonnel who may be attached to that Force..(c)&apos;French civilians abroad, notably in-Egypt and someof the French&apos;Colonies,When a previous draft of the Bill came before the Home -Policy Committee on the 8th instant the view was expressed thatit might be criticised in the House of Commons on the ground thatthe privilege was to be conferred upon Frenchmen &apos;only, and not,for example, upon refugees from Germany,&apos; Austria or Spain willingto assist the Allied cause.     At the same time it was felt that anyproposal to naturalise refugees generally would give rise to acutecontroversy.      On the whole, I think that the course open to leastobjection would be to confine the Bill to Frenchmen as it was onlyin respect of them that a specific pledge was given by the PrimeMinister.^ The Committee were of opinion that the proposals would be ...less likely to meet with criticism if the privilege of british nationality were confined to persons already serving at the timewhen the application is made, and they strongly recommend that this limitation should be adopted in the case of service in the armed forces...     The privilege cannot be confined to those serving in theHpirmed foroes, since the persons whom it is desired to naturaliseI   include certain French civilians abroad, particularly personnelJ   connected with the administration of the Suez Canal.     A limitation to persons actually serving would be ineffective as applied toSn&quot;^!^1^ W /r service because the persons engaged in such serviceT-S -    not  (unless industrial conscription were applied) be held to-heir engagement in the same way as soldiers.     Clause 1(b) cf thepill is drafted accordingly.
The Bill enables the Secretary of State in his discretion to grant a certificate/of -British nationality to any person whoappears to &quot;him, to&apos; be; a. French national or to have, &quot;been a -&quot;Fi*4&amp;iMb.national at the outbreak of war (although he may since then have:been deprived of. French: nationality)&apos;,   &quot;- The certificate -may -begranted to any such vpe&apos;rsori ^provided that- the Secretary of State&apos;is satisfied - ,.(a.t;hat he &apos;is of good character ;(b)   that- he is. a member of the- armed forces engaged inthe prosecution of. any war in which His- Majesty-Usengaged at the time of the application, - or is aperson&apos;able and willing-t&apos;6&apos;giv:&apos;e valuable -assistancein the prosecution of such a war in some othercapacity;   -and(c.)    that &quot;it is expedient in&apos;the interests Of the&apos;prosecution of such a war to .confer british nationality upon him-The residence qualification required for certificates ofnaturalisation in the ordinary way is, of -course, not applicable.The Bill makes provision for the inclusion .df wives and childrenon.the same basis as the ordinary nationality-law, and also forthe revocation of certificates&apos; granted under the Bi.ll.The Bill has been drafted as a self-contained measure andnot as an amendment of the British Nationality and Status of aliens Act, 1914,&apos; since It is thought very desirable to make&apos;it.quite clear that this is a temporary measure, occasioned by thewar situation, and. so to minimise, as far as possible,&apos; the breach in the principle &apos;that there shall be no alteration in thecommon ,code of British nationality ,law-except with.the concurremof the Dominions..    The provisions of the Bill will not haveeffect.&apos;in Canada, the Union of South&apos;.Africa or Eire on accountof the Statute of Westminster and&apos; wi 11 not 7 if clause 3 (2), ofthe Bill .is retained, have any effect in -Australia., or New-..

Itwill be for the Dominions themselves to decide whether&quot;-they.willpass corresponding legislation to give effect, to the provisions in this Bill in territories within their jurisdiction,-J,ASHOME OFFICE.JLOth August, 1940B
