secret^R^l^^ll^^Qk Copy No.2nd Aurrus !., 1940, JL-R . cabinet trade    RELATIONS    WITH    EIRE-.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.For some months past discussions have been taking place with aview to making a conprehensive agreement v/ith Eire on a number of purchase, supply and shipping questions.      The discussions began in April when with Cabinet approval the Eire Ministers of supplies and of Agriculture were invited to London.      Substantial agreement was reached or was within sight on a number of points, Includingthe coordination of Sire&apos; a import programme with that of the UnitedKingdom, the expansion of storage and shipping facilities in Eireports, the purchase and allocation of imported foodstuffs, and similar matters.      Difficulties however arose in settling theprices at which the United Kingdom Government could buy butter,cheese and bacon from Eire.      The Ministry of Food was not preparedto offer higher prices than those paid for corresponding productsIfroK the Dominions.     The reason for this was that if Eire received[higher prices the Dominions, whose imports are on a very much(larger scale, would expect to be given the same prices, although their costs of production would not    justify this.The Eire Ministers did not dispute the reason given by theMinister of Pood but they represented that the Eire farmers wouldbe obliged to reduce their output unless higher prices could begiven.      The United Kingdom Ministers took the view that it was desirable on general grounds to make an agreement and various methods of giving Eire a make-weight for the lower prices offered for butter,  cheese and baron in comparison with the United Kingdomprices were proposed.       .A   meeting of officials over which Mr. Eden,then Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs presided,  was held onMay 2nd to discuss the proposals.      For one reason or another?sometimes coming from one side, sometimes from the other, allthe     proposals were found unacceptable,  with one exception.This exception was a suggestion that in respect of fat cattle thepniittL Kii^domprice should be paid less a prewar differential v^xropitcentcdaprewarsubsidy to home produced cattle. The advantage of this proposal was that theexport of fat cattle is of primary importance to Eire, but fatcattle do not come from the Dominions.      Therefore if the plan were[adopted there could be no demand from the Dominions for similar treatment.I have set out briefly the facts stated at much greater length in a memorandum which has &quot;been seen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the President of the Board of Trade, and the Minister of Pood.      TheChancellor of the Exchequer takes the view that the proposal is really to pay a subsidy, which is likely to be of the order of^OGjOOO to Eire to secure her goodwill,  though he agrees that if!&quot;-ch a subsidy is to be paid,  this is  the best way of doing it,he Minister of Pood holds a similar view and suggests also that,fhile the advantages to Eire take the form of hard cash,  those to&apos;e secured by the United Kingdom are vague and intangible.      the resident of the Board of Trade is prepared to accept theroposal.      The discussions have dragged on a long time and theMinisterb3

Minister of Pood and I have &quot;been repeatedly pressed by the EireHigh. Commissioner for a definite answer.    If the proposal immediatelyInQuestion is not approved the all-round agreement will not be made,and we shall lose whatever advantages are likely to be derived from such an agreement.      In that event the political relations of the two^countries would be likely to suffer.      I should not attach so much importance to this last point, if it were not the case that these discussions have continued for a long time in the hope of arriving atfsome suitable methods of providing an offset for Eire as against theflower prices for dairy produce in comparison with United Kingdomprices.     Every suggestion that has been discussed has involved a^compensating payment of some sort or another and the search has beenyjor the best methods of doing it.     After having led Eire to thinkfbhat when agreement was reached on this point, no further difficulty would arise, and the larger agreement would be completed, I feel itIs hardly possible now to tell Eire that on financial grounds wecannot contemplate any form of compensation.%   One additional point may be mentioned.     Even assuming that theUnited Kingdom Government draw no substantial advantages from theIrest of the agreement, relating to trade and shipping matters, there is some benefit In having a &quot;nearby larder&quot; as fully supplied as possiblupon which we can draw and I am informed that the prices offered forSire primary -products are so low in comparison with the cost   ofproduction - apart from the proposed compensating price for livecattle - that they will have an adverse effect upon the level ofproduction in Eire./    I fully appreciate the view taken by the Chancellor of theExchequer but I hope that approval will be given to this proposal,so that the coiaprehensive agreement may be closed without further delay,(ltd.) Cofnd August, 19k0.
