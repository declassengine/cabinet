The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.November 20, 1940.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons.For over a year My Forces by sea, land and air have been defending thecause of freedom. My people everywhere, enduring with fortitude in their homes and work places, and at sea, the brutal attacks of the enemy, have noblysustained the common effort.By calculated treachery and violence Germany has brought under her yokemany free nations devoted to the arts of peace. I have been happy to receivehere the Governments of countries thus overrun. I rejoice that their armed forces, together with brave men of other nations, are now fighting side by side with My own.In the early summer France, overtaken by military disaster, felt compelledto sue for terms of armistice. Taking advantage of French misfortunes Italyseized the opportunity to range herself with the aggressor and has now launcheda wanton attack on Greece. I welcome in the struggle against tyranny a newcomrade to whom My Empire will bring all possible aid. By her courageousresistance Greece is proving herself worthy of her glorious past.My Forces in the Mediterranean are prepared to give a good account of themselves in all emergencies, and My country enjoys, in that region, the benefitof valued Treaties of alliance with Egypt and Turkey.It was with gratification that I learnt of the decision of the Government ofthe United States to transfer fifty destroyers to My Navy, and I trust that thegrant to that Government of defence facilities in certain territories on the atlantic seaboard may equally serve to defend the heritage of free men.Members of the House of Commons.I thank you for the provision you have made towards the increasingly heavycosts of war. The readiness of My people to accept these burdens confirms Mein My belief that they will think no financial sacrifice too great to ensure thetriumph of our cause.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons.I am glad that despite the heavy preoccupations of the war My Governmenthave found it possible to promote various measures for improving social conditionsin this country.The frustration of German plans for the invasion of Britain, the attacks upon the sources of German military power, the firm defence of Egypt and theSudan and the successful attack upon the Italian Navy give proof of our strength,and justify our confidence in final victory.The present war is not only a struggle between nations. It springs from theclash of fundamental ideals. We shall not falter or lay aside our arms until thehigh purposes, to which we have pledged our faith, are achieved.I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.[21920]
