I 26THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S CXWERNMENT.SECRET. .... ..      WAR CABINET.I.P. (G)(40) 205.jrd August, 194-0*SHIPS BELONGING TO THE BALTIC STATES.Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping. jIt is believed that thoro arc thirty-nine Estonian ships, (80,000 gross,tons), outside the Baltic of which twenty-eight, (54,000 gross tons), are in!bound for British ports.     There are also eighteen Latvian ships, (about 54,000gross tons), outside the Baltic of which five, (about 15,000), are in or nearBritish ports.     In addition to the 69,000 gross tons in or bound for british ports, a further 10,000 gross tons are on British charters but in or bound forneutral ports.The vessels arc mostly handy ocean-going cargo carriers.The Governments in Tallin and Riga have ordered all Estonian and Latvianvessels through owners agents and by telegrams direct to the ships to proceedto Latvia or Estonia or to Murmansk or vladivostock, and not to go into british or United States ports.     The severest penalties are threatened to mastersdisobeying these orders, and to their families.     Apparently, it is not intended to take account of existing commitments of the vessels.Since the 1st August messages have been sent to the ships ordering them tohoist the Rod Flag,The Anglo-Soviet Shipping Agency, (representing the Russian Charteringorganisation in the United Kingdom), has asked tho Ministry of Shipping forinformation as to the whereabouts of Estonian and Latvian vessels.     This was refused on the ground that it was contrary to practice to disclose such information.It seems olear, therefore, that the Soviet Government intend to bring these vessels under their own control forthwith irrespective of their presentcommitment s.COPY NO.    h(-It is submitted that we should not permit the Soviet Governmentarbitrarily to withdraw the vessels chartered to us without taking steps toprotect our interests.     In the absence of any assurance as to the future ofBritish financial and commercial interests in the Baltic States, it may boadvisable that wo should secure control of as many as possible of the ships ofthe Baltic States so as to strengthen our bargaining position, apart from theactual value of the shipping to us.The Estonian and Latvian Legations intervened last week with the ForeignOffice and tho Ministry asking for steps to be taken to protect the interestsof the owners of the vessels.     It ie also known that many of the crews of thevessels do not wish to put themselves in the power of the Soviet Government,The Estonian and Latvian Legations, however, have no power over the ships andno authority from the agents of the owners to charter their ships to theMinistry of Shipping in defiance of the orders from Tallin and Riga,Since the 29th July Estonian and Latvian ships have been prevented from leaving British ports on administrative pretexts pending clarification of theposition.     Tho official nature of the delaying action is obvious, however, anda formal protest has already been received by the Ministry of Shipping from therepresentatives of the Russian Chartering authorities.
The following action is proposed;-1.     To detain in British ports all ships belonging to the Baltic States.2. To bring into British ports, by persuasion or, if necessary, by force as many more of these ships as possible. Ships intercepted at sea shouldbe brought into British ports under armed guard.5.     In order to prevent the complete immobilisation of the vessels inBritish ports, they could be requisitioned under the Defence Regulations and put into service under the British flag.     It is expected that a substantial proportion of the crows would be willing to continue to serve at any rateunder forco majeure.This action will certainly call forth protests from the SovietGovernment and it will then be for consideration whether any of the ships should be released, having regard to the attitude of the Soviet government towards British financial and commercial interests in the Baltic Statesand to their willingness to permit a proportion of the vessels to remain inour service, on charter.The Foreign Office has been consulted and support the foregoingproposals.Lithuanian vessels, of which at present we have no information, andwhich are negligible, would be treated on similar lines.R.H.C.Ministry of Shipping,3rd August, 1940.
