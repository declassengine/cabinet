V7AR    CABINET&quot; &apos; &apos; &apos;&quot; : &apos; RECRUITMENT FOR FIRE,  POLICE AND&apos; &quot;*   ^ .    CIVIL DEFENCE SERVICES. &apos;       -0     ;;&apos;-&quot;&apos; ;&apos;&quot; &apos;.&quot;,&apos;. - ;,; - -&apos;;Memorandum by the Secretary of. State for War.. 1.  - The requirements of the Minister of Home Security*- as set out&apos;in&apos; his Memorandum W.P.(G)(hO) 32I4 are numericallysmall in relation to the size of the Arrny and its futureintake, and I raise no objection to the principle of his proposal which as tc&quot;divert to the &quot;Civil Defence Organisationsome 16,000 men who would otherwise pass&quot;into military service.If the existing system of recruitment for Civil Defence doesnot produce sufficient numbers&apos; In -the important localitiessomething must be done to remedy the shortage, and the methodproposed in paragraph 15(a)  of the paper may be the bestinterim.solution, though I take leave to question whether theexisting voluntary system can remain in being side by side witha system of semi-compulsion.2. Assuming,  therefore,  that the requirement is limitedto the numbers stated and that the Minister does net anticipatea consequential fall in the number of voluntary part-timefiremen which would involve a further and more serious drainupon the conscripted classes,  I accept the proposal in paragraph15(a), which indeed is but an elaboration of the planmentioned in paragraph 5(c) which is already in operation.3. I regret, however, that I cannot accept the proposal in paragraph 15(b).      So far as concerns the discipline ofthe Fire Fighting Service, nothing would be gained by adopting the formula of enrolment and relegation to Class W of theReserve.      The provisions of the Army Act cannot be appliedto members of this Reserve in respect of non-military service.Moreover,  there could be no justification for undertaking thefruitless clerical work which would, be involved, and it mustbe -obvious that the Army cannot afford to carry any considerablenumber of totally untrained men on its Reserve.km I see no r eason why the difficulty should not \ie met by arranging for a deferment of calling up notices to such men as have volunteered and been accepted for this work afterregistration.5. The proposals in paragraph 15(c) and (d)   clearlyraise a question of wide political bearing.      To  extendcompulsory service into the field of civil defence is buta short step from industrial conscription.      I do not condemnthe possibility of doing so on that account, but I suggestthat the implications of the wider measure must be faced beforelegislation is drafted on the minor issue.
6. In paragraph 10 of his Memorandum the Minister rnakejsoecial reference te -the Police Service and tc releases of trained oolicemen from-the Army,      I am prepared to consider with him&quot; the release of such men for particular localitieswhere, the need for this form, of assistance is clear.      I must point out, however,  that of...the 2-, 600&apos; police reservists now serving in the . Army - about^OOjL&amp;re in the Corps of MilitaryPolice&quot;a&quot;hd. most of the rest&quot; are in the Guards.      I cannot afford to release any from the Corps of Military Police, nercan I spare any important /-proportion of those who are in theGuards (many of. whom are- non-commissioned officers), representthe equivalent of nearly 2 battalions.      Already 100 policereservists have been released and 200 more have been offere-&quot;1tc the Home Office.      Any proposal based upon the universalrelease of policemen from the Army is one which could only beaccepted at serious risk tc the organisation and discipline of the Army as a whole.,.. -.      .,7. Pin-ally, as regards firemen,  I have already releasedno less than 3,300 and I am prepared to release any other menwho were whole time and fully trained firemen before they join the Army. .   I- could not, however, release, trained -soldiers fortraining asofiremen. ,A.-E..:The War Office,20th December,  19^0,
