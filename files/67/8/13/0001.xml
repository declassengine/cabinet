C - L-soPROPOSED AGREEMENT WITH EIRE.SHIPPING- FACILITIES.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Shipping.1.     In a Memorandum on Trade Relations with Eire, (W. P. (&amp;) (40) 204),submitted to the War Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,it was stated that substantial agreement had been reached, or was withinsight, on a number of points, including, amongst others, the co-ordination of eire&apos;s programme with that of the United Kingdom and the expansion of storage and shipping facilities in Eire ports.     After considering theMemorandum, the War Cabinet invited me to circulate a memorandum showing theadvantages it was hoped to obtain from the expansion of storage and shipping facilities in Eire.     If the offers already made by the Irish negotiatorsunder this head were inadequate I was asked to set out the extent to whiohI would wish to see those offers improved.2,     The requests which were put forward to the Eire Ministers, and theadvantages to be gained from them, were as follows:-(l) Confirmation of the existing arrangement whereby Eire charters allher shipping through the Ministry of Shipping charteringorganisation.     This practice, by eliminating Eire competition forneutral ships in the open market, enables Eire as well as ourselves to charter on more favourable terms than might otherwise be possible.(2) The planning of Eire&apos;s import programme to fit in with that of theUnited Kingdom so as to reduce the amount of shipping space requiredfor the combined Eire and United Kingdom programmes.(3) The Eire Government&apos;s agreement to our use of storage and transhipmentfacilities at Eire ports in case of need.     This would (a) reducethe danger of congestion in United Kingdom ports, (b) enable us tomake fuller use of the smaller United Kingdom ports which cannotaccommodate the large vessels, and (c) relieve the pressure onstorage facilities at United Kingdom ports, and on inland transportfrom those ports.(4) An increase of merchant ship repair facilities in Eire in order to relieve congestion in United Kingdom ship repair yards,3.     The Eire Representatives agreed to the proposals for chartering ships and the joint planning of import programmes.     They agreed to investigate thepossibilities of placing storage and transhipment facilities at the disposalof United Kingdom interests on the understanding that all transactions wouldbe regarded as purely commercial transactions and as far as possible would be conducted between private individuals.     They also agreed to explore thepossibilities of increasing ship repair facilities.4.     Military developments since the discussions with Eire Ministers haverestricted the storage and port facilities in Eire which could conveniently be used, but it would still be possible to use Dublin for storage andtranshipment and Lough Swilly for overside discharge.     Facilities fortranshipment would help to relieve the heavy concentration of large vessels-1-Secret. WAR CABINET. COPY NO.    g  W.P. (G) (40)21312th August, 1940.
which is a source of anxiety, for example, in the Clyde.     If our own port facilities -were seriously restricted &quot;by enemy aotion, the commercialadvantages ef using Eire port facilities would of oourse be greatlyincreased, provided that the Eire ports could be safely used from a navaland military point of view.The question of ship repair facilities is for the Admiralty, but Iunderstand that the only development which now appears practicable is there opening of a small dry dock at Dublin, and this would probably have tobe undertaken by a United Kingdom firm.5.     I do not wish to put forward any further proposals, but in making any agreement we should require that what so far has been a promise to investigate possibilties should be translated into a definite undertaking that the Eire Government would facilitate the use of their ports andwaters for storage and transhipment, and any practicable increase ofship-repair facilities.R.H.G.Ministry of Shipping,12th August, 19V).
