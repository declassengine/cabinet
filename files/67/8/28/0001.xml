The Government took control of the four main lineSailways and London Passenger Transport Board last September.Outline of financial arrangements was settled in February 1940(cmd. 6153).      They may be revised by agreement after the endthis year,2.      A net pool profit of  40 million is guaranteed, baseon 1955/56/57 average for Railways and year ended 50.6.59 for.P.T.B.     They are running Just over it at present.5.      If they earn another  5% million, they keep it.     Over 45  million they keep half to a total of  56 million which is1921 standard revenue for Railways, plus standard interest onBoard 0 Stock.      (This means a total net profit of  63^- million)4.      Agreement is based on the principle that the concernsare to be self-supporting and charges increased to meet provedincreased costs due to the war (costs, not expenditure) outwiththeir control,      (The alternative of subsidy was rejected).5.     Charges may be increased with or without reference tothe Railway Rates Tribunal acting as a Consultative Committee,which may recommend the incidence of increase, i.e., not whethernor how much;    only how.6,      Critics say the undertakings get it both ways -increased receipto from war traffics and war costs refundedthrough increased charges.     The answer given is (a) if charges were not increased, increased traffic might show no profit;(b) they are entitled to remuneration for extra work done;(c) if charges were not increased the concerns would be economically unsound at the end of the war;    (d) it would be unwise to subsidise railways and not roads.

7,     A further criticism - why should they have a guaranteedminimum of  40 million and a chance of earning up to 556 million?The answer given is that this was the price paid for government control - including the right to direct the concerns to adju.st services to war needs and to pool receipts so that those benefiting mostby war traffic sustain those who benefit least or even lose -e..g. L.P.T.B.     4-0 million is only about o% on capital involved,and it was felt that rights under Railways Act 1921 and. london passenger Transport Act 1935 could not be wholly ignored.8.     The Agreement was debated and severely criticised hutaccepted by implication in the Hou.se of Commons on February15 and April 25.II.9,      increased costs of  22 million to 51.5,41 were provedin April.     A 10fo main line increase was authorised (without reference to the Consultative Committee) from May 1, to produce 18 million in a year,  end (via the Committee)for L.P.T.B. of 2 million from July 1.10.     Charges were not increased till 8 months after control;there was then a lag of  8-g&quot; million to be made up.11.     A further application was made by the railway executive Committee in July.     The total claim from 1.9.59 to1.10.41 was  48 million of which  46 million was proved, and tomeet it the Committee suggested an increase on the lCfi of6.8;-o (total 17.5%).12.     This was referred to the Consultative Committee andits recommendations are expected by mid September with a viewto adoption on October 1.     The Railway Executive Committeesuggested an all-round pro rata increase;    the consultative committee might recommend differentiation.15.     There is evidence from all parts, but particularly inLondon, of organised protest of substantial importance andi-vrgehcy.

There are the following alteratives :-(l)   Preserve no subsidy principle and. Agreement terms,i.e. standing fast, accepting consultative committee*s recommendations for charges increase(with, or without modification).(S)   Preserve no subsidy principle, but try to modifyAgreement in favour of users, e.g. by reductionof profit chances (with or without quid pro quosuch as increase in annual  10 million for war damage).     This involves accepting presentincrease as in (l), but reducing possibilityand extent of future increases,(3)   Abandon no subsidy principle, meeting presentincrease by subsidy, (or anyhow any further ones),and negotiating modification of terms,(4)    Appoint a small committee to report on Agreement:whether it should be continued, modified orcancelled, present increase being held upmeantime.(5)    Irrespective of what is done about present increase,proceed at once with plans for bringing therailway system under Government ownership by wayof public corporation, as part of a comprehensive plan for co-ordination of all formsof transportation on similar lines,(Intd.)
