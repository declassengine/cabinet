Augustpresided over by theLord Privy Seal it was decided that: -&quot;Subject to the possibility of providing the necessaryfertilisers,  the Minister of Agriculture should,after consultation with County Agricultural Executivedotnmittees, submit for the approval of the WarCabinet a programme for ploughing up between 1 and million additional acres,  it being understood thatno precise figure should be specified in any public announcement made on the subject.&quot;The farm survey although not completed is nowsufficiently advanced to enable me to estimate the amount ofgrassland that could be ploughed up without undue difficultyin each county.As a result I propose a programme of ploughing upabout lV3 million acres.      Scotland and Northern Ireland eachcontemplate a programme of about 250,000 acres.      The total forthe United Kingdom will thus be between ijr and 2 million acres - a little less than last year.Included in this figure will be an increase in the potato acreage of about 200,000 acres, of which Scotland and NorthernIreland  will be responsible for 20,000 each.The new fertiliser programme should be sufficient.As this figure corresponds with that contemplatedat the meeting of the 8th August I request authority to issue the necessary instructionsa(Intld.)
