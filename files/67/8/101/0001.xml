THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO vEHTOdENT.SECRET.TAP. (G) (40)  501.15th November, 1940.WAR     CABINET.CHRISTMAS BREAK EOR WORKERS ON WAR PRODUCTION.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1.     With the approach of Christmas, it is becoming necessary to decide whether workers employed on work of national importance be given a break,and if so, what will be the best way of doing it.     Production must still remain our sole aim but I am convinced that it will help and not impedethat aim if one or two days rest is given at Christmas.     If announcedwithin the next week or two the prospect of it is likely to act as an incentive to workers to increase their output and assist in keeping them at their posts in bombed areas.2.     If a break is given I think it should be one worth having, e.g.,  threeclear days.     Care will, however, have to be taken that a whole week is notlost, as Christmas Day falls on a W wednesday this jeejr.     There are various alternatives, possibly the best being to close down on Monday, Tuesday andWednesday, 23rd to 25th December; in this event the workers would probablywork up to and including Sunday, 22nd December.     This would give them threeclear days away from their work and allow time for overhauling machinery andcleaning boilers, work which in many cases is becoming an urgent necessity.Similar arrangements would have to be made in the following week for aNew Year break for workers in Scotland.3.     Most industrial agreements make provision for additional pay (oftendouble time) for working on Boxing Day.     If the Christmas holiday is given before Christmas as suggested above, it will be necessary to adjust these agreements unless Boxing Day is altered to the Monday or Tuesday before christmas Day.     The alteration of industrial agreements is not easy andthe alteration of Boxing Day may have to be faced, a matter which affectsother interests such as the banks, and on which my colleagues will have &apos;be consulted.4.     It will be necessary before coming to a decision to obtain the advLof the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations on the question whether the]should be a break at Christmas and if so, what is the best method of doi] -it.     All, therefore, that I ask for now is authority to approach theJoint Consultative Committee of Employers and Trade Unions on the subject.When I have their views, I will bring the matter up again.(Initld.)
