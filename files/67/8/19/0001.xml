secret^p^XGKigj 21921st August 1940Copy No.WAR CABINET;        THE MANUFACTURE OP AIRCRAFT IN india memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.1. .    The Government of India recently submitted for theapproval of His Majesty&apos;s Government proposals for themanufacture of aircraft in India.   The broad outlines of thescheme are as follows:-(a) Mr. Walchand Hlrachand, a well-known Bombay businessman and owner of the ScIndia Steam Navigation Company,would establish a new Rupee Company with a paid upcapital of Rs.75 lakhs ( 562,500).(b) On the technical and production side the Company&apos;business would be in the hands of Mr. W.D. Pawley, whohas for six years been engaged in the manufacture of aircraft for the Chinese Government and whose latestundertaking In-China is the Loiwing Aircraft Factory.Cc) Mr. pawley &apos;Is in a position to manufacture american aircraft of several types and is in close touch withthe Curtis Corporation with which he has been associatedin the past.   The Company would establish at once a factory costing about&quot;Re.50 lakhs ( 375,000) and wouldimport the tools and materials required for the&apos; manu-facture of selected types.   The Company would alsoemploy about 22 American technicians, many with experience of Oriental labour,(d) The Government of India would place an order with theCompany for aircraft valued at some ten million dollars,including 10 per cent, for spare parts to be deliveredwith the aircraft.   Assuming a programme of 30 trainingaircraft, 60 C.W. 21 B. fighters.and 30 Martin TwinEngine or other suitable bombers, which wouldapproximately meet the Company&apos;s requirement and wouldalso suit the Government of India, the training aircraft would be delivered from the seventh to the sixteenthmonth from the date of the order and the-fighters fromthe eleventh to the eighteenth month from, the date ofthe order.   The delivery date of the bombing aircraft is less certain, but Mr. Pawley estimates&apos;that theycould be completed by the twenty-fourth month from thedate of the order.2.        These proposals have been discussed in considerable detail between the Government of India, Mr. Walchand Hirachandand-^Mr. Pawley, and the Government of India are now convincedoi the soundness and practicability of the scheme.   Tney areimpressed by Mr. Pawley&apos;s enterprise and&apos; capacity and by hisachievements at Loiwing under conditions of far gre-ateraiificulty than .exist in India.   They believe that he is in aposition to carry out his undertakings to the Company and to^nemselves.   Moreover, with the restriction of war supplies tq^yma, Mr. Pawley may well be obliged to transfer his energies-ere; and it ls considered that his ability and experiencwouia be a great asset to India and to the Empire as a whole.
3.        It is understood that the Air Ministry estimate tnat itwill be impossible to supply the air forces in India with any new aircraft before the spring of 1941; and it is impossibleto say what aircraft will be available for transfer to india at that date.   Meanwhile India1s defences remain perilouslywe a1&apos; and there is an insistent and increasing demand from both Indians and Europeans in India that immediate steps should be ta^en to strengthen them.    It is therefore a consideration of the greatest importance that the deliveryprogramme of the proposed factory holds out the prospect ofIndian manufactured aircraft being ready in a comparatively short time.   The Government of India have examined various schemes for manufacturing aircraft in India, but none whichoffers the possibility of such early deliveries, and nonewhich has the same advantages both financially and in thematter of professional competence.   The scheme carries with itevery intention of the progressive- utilisation of Indianresources, and its adoption would do much to convince loyalopinion in India, not only that energetic measures are beingta^en to fill gaps in India&apos;s defences, but also that proper use is being made of her resources in the general war effort,4.        The Government of India have also drawn special attention to the- advantages which would be derived from theestablishment of an aircraft factory in India for the repair of aircraft in case of hostilities directly involving thatcountry.   The strength of the staff at the Karachi AircraftDepot is sufficient to deal only with the normal numbers ofdamaged aircraft which have to be rebuilt..   In the case ofhostilities, these numbers are likely to be greatly increased,and an established aircraft factory would be of invaluableassistance in helping at its depot to do this major repairworv.   On the outbreak of hostilities between China and JapanMr. pawley&apos;s factory was extensively called upon to establishrepair depots for the reconstruction of Chinese aircraft whichhad received major damage; and the. factory succeeded in maintaining its new construction programme as well as in restoring to active service a large percentage of otherwiseunserviceable aircraft.   The Government of India are therefor of the opinion that their proposals should be considered fromthe point of view of maintaining their existing Air Force incase of hostilities, as well as from that of producing newmachines.5.        Information has been received that the AluminiumProduction Company of India Limited hope to be able to start the production of ingot aluminium from imported alumina inSeptember 1941.   They do not expect to be able to make aluminafrom locally mined bauxite in less than three or four years,but another company may be doing so at a comparatively earlydate.   This venture should also come in useful in connectionwith the scheme for aeroplane manufacture, and -is evidencethat India should become progressively independent of imported materials.6.        The programme outlined in paragraph 1(d) above is a modest one, and not of such dimensions as could interfereseriously with United Kingdom purchases in the United States,either directly, or indirectly by putting up prices.   On theother nana, it would not be practicable to restrict theprogramme further, for example, to manufacture training air-crait only; since an essential condition of the proposed agreement is an initial order to the value of ten million dollars.
7       The Government of India&apos;s proposals have been placednpfore the Minister of Aircraft Production who, however, is unable to agree that their adoption would not interfere withhis own demands on the United States market.   I am unable toaccept his view.   I therefore submit these proposals for thegeneral approval of the War Cabinet.INDIA. OFFICE.21st August 1940.
