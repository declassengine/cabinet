(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).It is ig^F, C R E T.W.P.(G) (40)327.15TH DECEMBER,   1940. OOPY NO.      0 *jWAR CABINET.SKILLED RADIO PERSONNEL.Progress Report by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.I,    INTRODUCTORY.1. Within the last week or two considerable progress has been made with the arrangements for securing skilledradio personnel for the Fighting Services and the RadioIndustry.     The plan has taken shape, and the War Cabinetmay .like to be informed as to the general lay-out.2, Memoranda were recently circulated to the WarCabinet by the Minister of Labour and National Service, theMinister of Aircraft Production, the President of the Boardof Trade and myself, W.P.(G)(40)298, 307, 310 and 311respectively, stressing the importance of co-ordinating thesupply of skilled radio personnel to the Fighting Servicesand the Radio Industry respectively.     These Memoranda were discussed at a conference at Montagu house, under theChairmanship of the Minister of Labour and National Service,on 11th December,     Complete agreement was reached on all points and appropriate action was concerted for carrying outthe decisions, as described in Section IV of this Report.3, In other directions however, besides labour andindustry, developments have taken place which have not yetbeen reported, e,g. in the Fighting Services themselves, inthe Universities, and with a view to the tapping of canadian and American sources of supply.     The moment5 therefore, isopportune for a general conspectus.4, It is necessary at the outset to emphasise that sometime must elapse before the various sources of supply can give their full yield.     In the meantime the need is insistent.The effiamy&apos;s   air attacks by night on this country continue,thougn fortunately on a reduced scale for seasonal and other reasons.     As yet these attacks have not reduced our war effort to a dangerous extent.     Nevertheless the losses to human life,shipping, docks, factories, communications, utility services,public and private property and ancient monuments are in theaggregate considerable.     At present their effects on publicopinion are counter-balanced to some extent by the goodnews from the Mediterranean.

But we are not yet in sight of the infliction on enemy aircraft of those heavy losses which are so important from the point of view of their effect on the German AirForce, our own war effort and our people&apos;s morale.     Wecannot feel easy in our minds, and we shall not escapecriticism until we are bringing down enemy aircraft by night on a scale that bears some comparison to what wecan do by day.      It is unnecessary to labour the pointfurther because the Prime Minister has twice emphasised the importance of&quot;the whole sphere of R. D. F. with its measurelesspossibilities&quot;from the point of view of material and personnel, and has put it in the first order of priority. /5. The supply of the necessary apparatus has begun, andin some items is already outstripping the numbers of personnel sufficiently skilled to use it to full effect,,and unless drastic action is taken this condition will only right itself gradually.     At the end of this Memorandumprovisional steps are suggested for alleviating the situationpending full operation of the plan described in this Report.II,    THE GENERAL SCHEME.6. The Fighting Services maintain establishments fortraining personnel for the various forms of R. D. F. . and otherradio development, for which they are respectively responsible.These establishments are and must remain the principal sources of supply of skilled personnel for the Services.      Leadingfirms engaged in the Radio Industry also have their owntraining arrangements, some of them of a high order of efficiency.7. The present difficulties in the Fighting Servicesarise from the rapid march of science in the hot-house ofwar,conditions, resulting in considerable recent improvements in the apparatus which had been in course of developmentbefore the war.These advances have necessitated -(a) A very rapid expansion of personnel.      In the Army,for example, one highly skilled officer may berequired for each G. L. set.(b) A much higher standard of electrical knowledge than before.      Some of the latest Marks of R.D.F.apparatus require a knowledge of andskill for. installation, maintenance and operation that, in normal times, would only be obtained after someyears of training and experience.The available sources of personnel with these highqualifications are limited, and a good deal of it is only tobe found in the industry which is making the apparatus and cannot be released without permanent injury to supply.8, The greater the electrical knowledge of the personnel on entering the Service training establishments, the shorter will be the time within which it can reach the/   W.pe.

be useful In some forms of R0D0F. with a minimum oftraining,     Consequently my colleagues and I have devotedour efforts firstly towards discovering available sources of men and v/omon. with a good background of the righteducation and experience, and secondly, in providing themeans by which young people can be given useful training before they reach the age at which they become availablefor the Fighting Services and industry.9. The immediate plan, therefore, is to find personnelwith training and experience enabling it to be absorbedrapidly into this side of our war effort, and the long-rangeplan is to provide training facilities which will enablethe necessary personnel to enter the training establishments of the Fighting Services and industry with a sufficientbasis of knowledge to enable them to reach the properstandards as rapidly as possible.III.    HOME SOURCES OF SUPPLY.10,        For highly skilled personnel the most promising-source was the B.B.C. with its television experience, butthe utmost that they could spare at the present time withoutgrave detriment to broadcasting was 17 men, composed ofspecialists and men suitable to become officers at once.Thanks to the good offices of the Minister of Informationthese men have been made available to the R0A.F.11. A second and invaluable source has been the PostOffice which promised hOO men and 50 women at once, and an addition of 1,600 men and 19000 women later0      It isanticipated that this source will provide mainly operatorsand few if any of the much needed radio-mechanic category.Some, however, may be able to replace and set free forhigh-grade work personnel in other branches of radio work(e.ge  the &quot;Y&quot; Services)D      Colonel Angwin of the PostOffice px^esides over a Committee that is working out details.12. A third source from which considerable numbers ofmen are hoped for is a &quot;comb-out&quot; of the Army - the other services have already &quot;combed&quot; their ranks,      This processof &quot;combing&quot; has been assisted by the Radio Manufacturers&apos;Association, which recently produced a list of 6,000 men with electrical experience who they had reason to believewere not being utilised to full advantage.      The WarOffice and Air Ministry have followed up these lists and obtained several hundred men for radio work,     Mr. Rosen,The Vice-Chairman of the Radio Manufacturers&apos; Association,informs me that a number of additional men should now become available owing to the calling up since the submission of his last list of additional age groups andhas offered co-operation in ascertaining their whereabouts.At ray request the officers concerned (Brigadier Chapman ofthe War Office and Group-Captain Rodney of the AirMinistry) have resumed their contact with Mr, Rosen andMr. Abbott of the Board of Education, and will continue their work as a Sub-Committee in association with my ownComnittee.35     From this &quot;comb-out&quot; appreciable numbers ofthe essential mechanic class have been, and may continueto be drawn,,je   The valuable work of this group in securingtraining facilities from the Radio Manufacturersis described below in paragraph 18.

13.       As to the officer category, Mr. Brundrett of theAdmiralty has obtained from the Universities and elsewherea number of specialists for research and similar purposes in the Navy and Air Force.    The Ministry of Supply ishelping the War Office to obtain 1,000 suitable men, drawnpartly from the schoolmaster class, to be trained at a WarOffice training establishment near London.    One of the universities has sent in a list of men already in the Army,whom they believe to be &quot;misplaced&quot;.    These names are being followed up by the Wireless Telegraphy Board.   The otherUniversities are being asked if they can help in this way.A large yield for immediate service, however, is not expected from this source.14.       For the future supply of the Officer Class forRadio services however, the Universities and UniversityColleges, which have been approached through the Committeeof Vice-chancellors, (Chairman, Sir Franklin Sibly) arerendering yeomanservice.    They have agreed in principlethat the third year men graduating in physics and lightelectrical subjects shall work on an agreed syllabus (whichhas already been drawn up) with a view to training them forR.D.F. work, and some 300 should become available inMidsummer 1941.   Another 250 drawn from those taking theirdegrees in mathematics and certain other scientificsubjects will, it is hoped, in Midsummer 1941 undergo a post-graduate training in a selected University, and shouldbe available a few months later, if selected, for commissionsin the radio branches of the Fighting Services.   TheTreasury have approved the scheme in principle, and it isbeing worked out in detail with the Universities as fast aspossible.15.       In present conditions parents are somewhat reluctant to send their young people to Universities when they leave their secondary or public school.    Consequently the futuresupply to the Universities of suitable personnel for thespecial courses to qualify them for radio work in future years requires consideration.    This point is in the pro-gramme and will be taken, up as soon as the plans for 1941are complete.IV.    THE RADIO AND LIGHT ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES.16.    The Radio and Light Electrical industries are bothpossible sources of supply and competitors for the skilledwireless personnel required by the Fighting Services.    the skilled personnel is useless without the apparatus and theapparatus is useless wither&quot;-, the skilled personnel.    The twomust be balanced.     Some assistance is also being obtained fi-o&quot;the light electrical industry     As already mentioned in para-graph 2 this matter was discussed at the Ministry of Labour on11th December.     The results are given below.17.       In order to increase the supply of personnel fortheradio-mechanic category of skilled wireless personnelthe Ministry of Labour and National Service has alreadyraised the age of exemption for electrical tradesmen from23 years to 30 years, as recommended in my note of 21stNovember (W.P.(40) 311), Conclusion 2.    In order to ensure

that these men shall be used to the utmost possibleadvantage in the national interest, the Minister ofLabour and National Service has undertaken to arrange that every suitable man becoming available, who is not already sufficiently trained, shall, so far as possible,immediately be put into training for this special workand not allowed, when he becomes redundant, to driftinto other industries,,   The necessary arrangements arebeing worked out and a preliminary panel of industrialadvisers has been selected018.     The Ministry of Labour and National Service will no doubt take into account a scheme of training for the radio-mechanic class, which has only just come to mynotice.    The officers of the War Office, Air Ministry and board of Education mentioned above in paragraph 12 have worked, out with Mr. Rosen (Vice President of the RadioManufacturers&apos; Association) a scheme of training forradio mechanics.   Some twenty Technical Colleges(including polytechnics) have been selected, to which men will be sent by the War Office for preliminarytraining.    The instructors have been chosen in co-operation with the Radio Manufacturers&apos; Association and given a short course of training at Cranwell.   A certainamount of suitable apparatus has been supplied by the manufacturers.    All details have been worked out.    Thescheme has received Treasury approval and is to come intooperation for the Army this month.   The Air Ministry hasnot yet applied the scheme, but has reserved its right todo so.19.       The above plans, it is hoped, will before longproduce personnel of the radio-mechanic category with agood grounding for the War Office training establishments,20.       The suggestion for the prohibition of manufactureof certain articles of electrical equipment (W.P. (G)(40)311.,paragraph 8 and recommendation 2) has not been adopted, asthe President of the Board of Trade reports that his department already exercises control over the industrythrough restrictions on raw material, and that, asmanufacturers are already not permitted to sell more than20 per cent of their pre-war output, there is noinducement to manufacture beyond their quota.    The objectof the suggestion, therefore, is already substantiallyachieved.   Manufacture must languish and some personnelwill be obtained from this source.21.       A companion recommendation that the question ofthe possible curtailment of the manufacture of radioapparatus for export trade and the home market should be examined (W.P.(G;(40)311, Conclusion 1) is being taken upby the President of the Board of Trade in consultation withthe Minister of Information.    The principle of the re-striction of manufacture of radio sets for domestic use was accepted by a representative of the Ministry of information at the meeting held at Montagu House on 11th December on condition that the maintenance of existing sets is

4J 7 8assured,      A suggestion that any shortage in civiliansupplies should he met by a redistribution of existingsets is being examined by the two Departments,      It wasagreed that no restriction should be imposed on themanufacture of sets for export.22.       Another proposal for the setting up of a scheme forthe centralised servicing of domestic wireless sets inorder to release skilled men, and which I have already discussed in a preliminary way with representatives of theindustry, will also be examined by the Ministries ofSupply and Information.23. In addition, the Minister of Labour and NationalService has undertaken an investigation into the labour employed in. the radio industry.2k..      &apos; The apportionment between industry and the Servicesof the available labour supplies resulting from all this action and investigation has been allotted to me.      Thematerial &quot;for a scientific apportionment is not at present available, as the total requirements of the Fighting services are only now taking shape, and those of industry are notyet known.      The Ministry of Labour and National service is undertaking to ascertain from the Supply Departments their requirements for additional labour up to the end of March,1941, and to collate the demands of the Admiralty and ministry of Aircraft Production with their own for presentation to my Committee.     Until&apos;the complete figuresfor demand and supply are ascertained, and I have material to reach a conclusion on their apportionment, it has beenagreed that I shall act on my own suggestion that theavailable labour shall be distributed equally between theServices and industry, subject to exercise of discretion in any particular case.v&quot;    PERSONNEL FROM OVERSEAS.25.       Efforts are being made to obtain skilled radiopersonnel from overseas.      The Dominions were firstconsidered.      I was informed that Australia, New Zealand .and South Africa required the whole of their availablepersonnel for their own needs.26, Canada, however, has already rendered valuable assistance to the Navy and Air Force, and efforts arebeing made to obtain the loan of further personnel..27.       An approach has been made to the Headquarters of theCanadian Forces in England, who have made a favourable response, and who are discussing details with the WarOffice,      In the event of any difference between departments on the use of any men obtained from this source I have undertaken to decide0

3 i 9280        In addition, an officer of the R.A.F.  SquadronLeader Russell, has recently visited Canada with a viewto obtaining some further assistance and has obtained a promise of two or three hundred -men.29.       With the approval of the Prime Minister and of allthe Ministers   concerned departmentally, a telegram, was sent to Washington on the 12th December asking the opinionof His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador on a proposal to attract8,000 radio mechanics from the United States of America for service in the first instance in the Canadian Forces, butultimately, it was hoped, in this country in order to helpmeet our need for radio mechanics for servicing andmaintenance of radio apparatus.      The death of the Marquessof Lothian, so deeply regretted on wide grounds, is a severe blow in this matter of radio personnel, as I had discussed the matter with him on the eve of his departureand enlisted his interest,,      Nevertheless, we must hope thatthe Minister in Washington and Lord Lothian&apos;s successor maybe able to help us,30P        I have already been in touch with the High Commissionex-for Canada and General McNaughton on some of the abovematters, and, by arrangement with the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and the High Commissioner, I am also intouch with Colonel RalstoncVI.    IMMEDIATE NEEDS.31.       The sources mentioned above will in due course supplyand maintain the needs of the Services in skilled radiopersonnel.,     Although the data are not yet available for asatisfactory balance sheet, there is every hope that in theofficer class and the operator class the necessary personnelwill become available before long.      As yet, however, inspite of the arrangements described, the numbers being obtained are too few especially in the category of mechanics,,Some kinds of R. D.F. apparatus are already coming forwardfaster than the personnel to service them, and instanceshave come to notice of the failure of these secret devicesfor lack of proper installation, adjustment and servicing.Unless some drastic action is taken to meet the present emergency our anti-aircraft and other applications of theR.D.F. principle will not produce their full result for sometime for lack of personnel sufficiently skilled to maintainthem in a state of efficiency.320       Tv/o suggestions have been made for improving theimmediate situation in this important respect.(i)    That selected personnel from the Fighting services should be sent to manufacturing firms for a fewweeks&apos; training in sex-vicing and operating thematerial on order.(ii)    That the manufacturing firms should make arrangements,Y/herever this is practicable, for servicing orassisting to service the apparatus they aresupplying, as I understand, is already thepractice in some foirns of armament.     This propos--3&quot;would have the double advantage of increasing theefficiency of the servicing ax-rangements and ofgiving the f ixrnis an insight into the use and working of the apparatus they are installing,which at present they lack, and which might easily lead to improvements in manufacture.

33*       Both the above proposals and especially theformer are in operation to a limited extent and indifferent ways in the three Services (discussion paragraph 18)but not on any considerable and systematic scale.    Theyare remedies, which lie in the hands of the Servicesthemselves, each of which knows the firms which aresupplying its material^    The circumstances of the Serviceshowever, differ in detailQ31)..        I strongly recommend that each of the FightingService Departments should adopt suggestions (i) and (ii)and apply them with vigour and with the least possible delay according to its needs035*       If this suggestion is adopted I trust that my committee may be informed as to details, as a certainamount of co-ordination will be necessary in this as inaH   other branches of the subject.36.        I trust that the above plans will commendthemselves to the War Cabinet, and above all that thetwo proposals mentioned in the preceding paragraphs foralleviating the present position in the radio-*iechaniccategory will be adopted by the Fighting Services.(Sgdo )    hankey.55, Whitehall, 8.117.1.15TH DECEMBER, 19^0*
