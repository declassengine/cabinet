I have practically completed a personal visit to all County war agricultural Executive Committees in England and Y/ales.   I feel I must call mycolleagues&apos; attention to the very serious effects which military and airpreparations against the possibility of invasion have already had on foodproduction.   These effects are likely to become increasingly serious unlessdrastic steos can be taken at once.   As far as one can gather we have to face the possibility of two main types of enemy action(i) Invasion accompanied by an aerial blitzkrieg directed at military objectives in this country and at our factories and towns.(ii) Siege -conducted by submarine and aerial attacks on our shipping andaerial attack on our ports, docks and internal communications.2. Certain Ministerial Committees are making preparations to meet thefirst of the above dangers.    Others appear to be taking steps to meet the second of these dangers.    On the one hand the Military and Air authorities are engagedin preparing defence works and obstructions over a large part of the country tomeet the danger of invasion,,   At the same time the Agricultural Departments arebeing instructed to plan as great an increase in food production as possible tomeet the danger of siege from the aerial bombardment of the ports and docks.   Theimmediate danger is invasion, but if there were any serious difficulty inclearing goods through the ports increased home production of food would becomeof supreme imoortance and in fact the Agricultural Departments have been instructed to consider providing for a situation in which clearance of foodthrough the ports for internal consumption might be reduced from its present rateof 20 million tons to a figure considerably less.3. At present the Government&apos;s plans-for meeting the two dangers appearto be pursued independently without regard to each other.     They are often in conflict and at present it is proving quite impossible to secure any reasonabledegree or even semblance of co-ordination.4. An immense amount of havoc is being caused to food supplies and foodproduction by the preparations being made to meet the danger of invasion by air and sea.   Some part of the damage is of course inevitable but a great deal ofit is quite unnecessary.    The question also arises as to the extent to whichprecautions against invasion (which in any case cannot give 100 per cent,insurance) should be carried at the expense of our food supplies next winter andspring.    It is at least arguable that some of the steps being taken by Military,Air and Civil authorities cause damage to food production out of all proportion to any real security they give against sea or air-borne invasion.   I have found,for example, that various Military and Air Commanders have expressed to myWar Agricultural Executive Committees very different views about what isnecessary.   This not unnaturally is having a very serious psychological effecton the farming community who cannot reconcile the demands for increased foodproduction next year with the wanton damage they see being done to crops whichthey had been expecting to harvest this yearQ5, Similarly there is at present a lack of co-ordination between theactivities of the Ministry of Home Security designed to protect the civilpopulation against the dangers of bombing or invasion and the need for maintain-ing food production near   aerodromes, along the coastal belt and in theProtected and Defended areasn

6. It was hoped that the establishment of the Home Defence Executivewould provide the necessary means of co-ordinating the various aspects ofnational defence including food production,,   This body, it was understood,was to consider military requirements, the safety of the civilian population and the need for carrying on essential war industries and to reach decisions.It has succeeded in achieving a large measure of agreement and co-ordinationat headquarters.   Its work however has in many cases been rendered nugatoryby the failure of local commanders and authorities to carry out instructionsdesigned to safeguard food production.   Each Regional Commissioner, eachCommand and indeed each unit, seems to be a law to itself, and Contractorsworking under the Military authorities have disregarded the decisions issued from headquarters.7. Another weakness has been the difficulty of co-ordinating the policyof the Military authorities and the Air authorities in regard to deterrents to enemy aircraft landings and of securing uniformity in practice.   some machinery appears necessary to bring the Military and Air authorities together on this subject and secure clear rulings on the scope and character of themeasures to be taken08. The following action seems to be absolutely essential to overcome thepresent confusion.,(i) A decision by the Y/ar Cabinet that food production in this country isa vital war industry which must be carried on in all districts regard-less of risks to farmers or workers as long as possible, i.e. untilactual invasion occurs in the immediate vicinity.(ii) Prom this decision it would follow that Military, Air and civil authorities would be told that it is imperative that damage to orinterference with agriculture should be reduced to a minimum.   And itwould be the function of the Home Defence Executive to secure thenecessary co-ordination between Military requirements and the needs offood productions    The R./-.F. should be linked with the work of the HomeDefence Executive to secure some degree of uniformity between the plans of the R.I.F. and the Army in regard to obstructions.(iii) When decisions have been reached by the Home Defence Executive clearinstructions must be sent to all local officers, Military, Air and civil, and these officers must be made to obey them.(intld.)
