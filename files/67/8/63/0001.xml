COPY NO.   3 &amp;WAR CABINET,THE MEANS TEST.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.The proposal made &quot;by the Minister of Labour in his memorandum of the 10th October (war.(G)(hO) 259) raisesnot only a matter of great financial importance but aquestion of major policy, with wide social and political implications.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggests that in thefirst instance the matter should be examined by a Committeeof officials under a Treasury Chairman.     It appears to methat while such a Committee, if given a definite reference,would be a useful instrument for working out and presenting the financial and administrative implications of any proposedalterations in the basis of the Means Test, it would bebetter if the matter were first of all discussed by aCommittee of Ministers in order that the issues of social policy might be considered and specific proposals be madefor detailed examination,,.(Intld.)
