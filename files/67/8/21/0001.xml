C R E T.^(AO^ 381.AUGUST.1940,COPY NO:WAR     CABINET.USE OF UNIVERSITIES FOR ARMY PURPOSES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.At their meeting on the 26th July (W.I,l(40) 213,Conclusion 9) the War Cabinet approved my proposals, ,contained in W.P(G)(40)198, for a scheme to give six monthstraining at certain selected universities to potentialofficers of the technical arms.     Agreement has beenreached with the Treasury as regards the financing of theseproposals, and I now circulate a draft Press announcement,setting forth the details of this scheme, for approval bythe War Cabinet.In accordance with the Cabinet decision mentionedabove further discussions with the Vice-Chancellor andPrincipals of the Universities have taken place on thequestion of compelling university students to join thetraining corps.     The general feeling was that compulsionwas desirable, but that it should be done by the Governmentand not by the University authorities.     The possible methods of Government compulsion are being examined.A.E.The War Office,19th August, 1940.

Amm to v/np. (g) (40) 221.DRAFT PRESS AlTIIOUMCEliENT .At a moment&apos; v/hen the Army is expanding with unprecedented,speed it is necessary to ensure well in advance that every branch;0f the Service, and particularly the more technical branches, aresupplied with fully skilled leaders.      This means that the supplyIf young men with the necessary mathematical and scientificqualifications, available ,for training as officers of the royal engineers, R6yal Corps of Signals and Royal Artillery, must.beincreased. - .In.order to ensure a steady flow tg Officer Cadet -Training Units of young men with the qualifications required, ascheme has been drawn up by which 1,200 men will be trained.atselected Universities every six months at Government expense..plie number concerned is, of course,  only a small fraction ofthe total requirements of officers for these branches of theService..: IExaminations, conducted by the Civil Service-Commissioners, will be held twice yearly in June and November,&apos;either concurrently with or shortly after the Navy Entrance-Examinations.     Successful candidates will be notified ifIfinally selected under the scheme and, after being attested, will serve in the ranks of an Other Rank Training Unit or YoungSoldiers unit for three to four month so   . Thereafter, if satisfactory, they will proceed to one or other of the selectedUniversities for six months    Whilst at the University they willIbe relegated to Class W of the Reserve and will serve in the -funiversity Training Corps?     On completion of this course, andlif still recommended, candidates will be posted to an 0,C.T.U. of the arm of the service -they select for..,graining as officers.The age limits ror uiose wisnxng oo taice tne examinationfare 18 year&apos;s to 18 years and 6 months on 1st January, 1941, for those sitting in November 1940 ? and on 1st July, 1941, for thosefitting in June 1941c.The following is an illustration of what should be thenormal experience of a candidate for a commission in the RoyalCorps of Signals.     If the candidate is successful in November andpn the first of January 1941 is 18 years and 2 months old, he willle enlisted in December or January and will join a unit.     He goesp to the University at 18 years 5 months and will be 18 years.1 months when he leaves to go to the O.G.T.U.      There he will dohe cadet course, which is 6 months,, and will be ready forornraissioning at the age of 19 years 5 months..   In the present circumstances it is clearly necessaryhat the scheme which is calculated to increase the efficiencyf the Army shall be put into force without delay.     Next Octobers the earliest possible date at which the first series ofourses can begin, and the first series will begin then.     but here will not be time to hold an eliminating examination for he first Course before October.      It has been decided thereforeo fill these Courses with candidates who, being between the agesf 18 and 19 years on 1st June, 1940,, are nominated,byeadmasters and selected by the V/ar Office.      Any young man,hether he is at School or has left School,  or who is servingn the Army, e.g. Home Defence units, is eligible provided hiseadmaster or late Headmaster nominates him.      Particulars havesen sent or are being sent to all concerned./ In
In order to ensure that the scheme will mobilise forthe purposes required the best brains regardless of whether theyoung man can afford a university education or not, the coursewill be.free, and the Universities concerned will be given agrant to cover expenses.These Courses are intended to supplement the somewhat similar scheme already in operation for training young tradesmen.These are enlisted at 18 years and after training as soldiers andtradesmen are available to take their place in Home Service unitsor organizations till they reach the age of twenty.     Thepossibility of selecting certain of the best of these youngsoldiers for the University Course is now being explored.The purposes and nature of the new scheme may besummarised as follows :-(1)     The Army is great and growing.     When it reaches its full stature its every limb must be properlyarticulated.(2)     Provision must be made against any possible lack of efficiency in any section of what will be the nationin arms.(3)     A measure of pre-selection of men possessing inembryo certain qualifications is necessary.(4)     These men will be selected on proved merit.     their qualifications will be character and aptitude only.-   -      The scheme is neither plutocratic nor aristocraticbut technocratic.      It aims at getting the right menin the right places in the Army of the Machine Age.
