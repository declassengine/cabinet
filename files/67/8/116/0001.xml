The War Cabinet invitecl meK and the Ministers in   jcharge of the Supply Departments to ascertain Mr. Purvis&apos;!views on the proposal that a... additional order for machine tools, value  10 millions, should he placeddirectly by the Ministry of Aircraft production in theUnited States.2. Mr. Purvis&apos; s views having been ascertained, I called,a meeting which whs attended by the Minister of Supplyand the Parliamentary and. Financial Secretary to theAdmiralty (on behalf of the First Lord).     The Ministerof Aircraft production was invited but did, not attend,He had, however, previously intimated to me that he wanted,the matter put again to the War Cabinet.3. Of the  12-il- millions likely to be available during the next six months from previous orders (seeparagraph 2 of w.p. (&amp;) (40) 299) , the Supply departments are getting appropriate proportions&apos;.4. The float order for  10 millions authorised, on 2nd November (see paragraph 6 of W.P. (C-) (40) 299) and. nowbeing placed for delivery in.the second, half of 1941 was for appropriate division also.5, Mr. Purvis is sure that the Ministry of aircraft production cannot place a further order for  10 millionsdirect, but he feels that it might be possible to channela further  10 millions through the British PurchasingCommission, for delivery in the second, half of 1941,without prejudice to the  22-g- millions referred to inparagraphs 3 and. 4 above.6. Both the Ministry of Supply and. the Admiralty wouldclaim their appropriate share of this further  10 millions^7. I recommend that authority be giver, for a furtherorder for  10 millions, for appropriate division &quot;betweenthe  aipply Departments, to be channelled through the BritishPurchasing Commission.(Intd.)
