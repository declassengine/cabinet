secret.P.(G)(40) 260 WaR CABINET Copy No. Ia Ifllth October 1940 . . india memorandum by the Secretary of State lor india with reference to my memorandum W.P.(G)(40) 252,dated 3rd October, I now circulate to the War Cabinet an appreciation by the Governor-General of the position whichhas arisen from the refusal of both the Congress and theAll-India Moslem League to be parties to the plan of appointing Indian political-leaders to his Executive Coun-cil and of setting up a War Advisory Council.   As will beseen from the telegram, the conclusion at which, after full consideration, he has now arrived is that in thepresent situation the plan should be held in suspense, andshould not be implemented unless and until such degree ofgeneral support may be forthcoming as would- ensure that   .the expanded Executive Council and the proposed war advisory Council were reasonably representative.   He alsosuggests that the decision should, be announced in a reasoned statement such as.he outlines in-paragraph 7 ofhis telegram.&apos;2.      As the War Cabinet will have seen from my previous memorandum, and from telegrams subsequently circulated, I myself, until the receipt of this telegram, had been definitely disposed to favour the policy of going ahead with the scheme notwithstanding the refusal of the two main parties to cooperate.   I dislike the idea of allowingCongress and the League between them, on purely sectionaland incompatible grounds, to put a veto on our consideredpolicy for immediate Indian cooperation in the conduct ofthe war, and to that extent letting down those who wouldbe orepared to worv with us.   Moreover we have (as was stated in the closing paragraph of the Viceroy&apos;declaration of August 8th) regarded the cooperation of indians in India&apos;s war effort as helping to create thatatmosphere of practical accommodation and give and tavein which alone the problem of India&apos;s constitutionalfuture can be approached.   To that extent the suspension of our immediate programme of entrusting Indians with realadministrative responsibility involves a setback to- thefuture solution of the problem.   All the same&quot;T:feel itimpossible to suggest that the Cabinet should overlook theViceroy&apos;s considered views.   He has very carefully weighedthe alternatives and is clearly in the best position togauge correctly the many conflicting influences at worvand the personalities behind them.It may be that the situation will undergo some changwhich would enable a sufficiently representativeExecutive Council to bo formed later on.   In any case ouiidisappointment in this respect should not be regarded as iin any sense a failure of the policy of which the offer ofIndian participation in the Executive Council is a part.The offer itself has demonstrated to the world our earnes\desire to secure the active co-operation of Indianpoliticians and our readiness for this purpose to maveforthwith a constructive advance towards representative government at the Centre.   More important still, the
underlying condition of our policy for the future, namely that constitutional progress must be based on compromiseand agreement between the main elements in India&apos;national life, has reassured Moslems, Princes, and Hinduminorities that their fate is not to be settled over their iheads by a deal between the British Government and congress.   It is by that reassurance that we have secured the withdrawal by the Moslem League of itsrefusal to permit its members to join.provincial WarCommittees, and the acquiescence of the Moslemvolunteer organisation ^nown as Khalcsars, who in therecent past have given considerable trouble, in theban on quasi military drilling..   We can, I thinv, loo1&apos;to general support from Moslems and other elements in indian public opinion to support us in any measureswhich we may be compelled to tave by Congressintransigence.   Our general policy is one on which, inspite of this disappointment, we can afford to standfast and, if necessary, act -with firmness, with general approval from reasonable opinion in India and outside.3.        I therefore recommend that the War Cabinet should authorise me to inform the Governor-General that theproposals contained in his telegram are agreed to, andto request him to furnish for consideration by theCabinet a draft of the statement for publication whichhe has outlined in his paragraph 7.L.S.INDIA OFFICE11th October 1940.
2072-SMy secret and personal telegram of September 22nd,1933-3.   You will bave had the resolutions passed byMoslem League at their Bombay meeting, and you will also have had part of resolutions passed by Mahasabha on 21st-23rd September.   The Congress position remains as before,though since my telegram of September 22nd I have had discussions with Gandhi which I have reported to youseparately.   So far as minority parties go, we have had from Aney an indication that he would serve on an expandedCouncil, and SiHis remain as anxious as before to get into one although no offer or commitment of any sort has beenmade to them.    The Scheduled Castes equally remain readyto serve in an expanded Council.2.       We have now to consider what our policy is to be inthe light of the refusal not only of Congress, but ofMoslem League to cooperate in an expanded Council and aWar Advisory Council on terms which we could accept, anaof the fact that the Mahasabha, while still I.am quite certain very anxious to come in, have demanded that if the moslems are to receive two seats in Executive Council, and five In War Council,-the Mahasabha should receive sixseats in Executive Council (one for 3ivhs and one forScheduled Castes) and fifteen in War Council on a population basis.3.       I set out in my telegram, of, 22nd September the three main alternative courses which.at that stage seemed to melively to merit consideration in the event of moslem league declining to cooperate, and while refraining fromformulating any view of my own, I brought out very .definitely in paragraph No95 the strong arguments that could be urged against allowing our proposals of 8thAugust to lapse.   At time when telegram was prepared it -was still impossible to judge what was lively to happenat Moslem League deliberations, and in particular thecircumstances in which, if they did decline to cooperate,they would so decline, he. whether there would beinternal differences or even an internal split.4.      Events have shown that jinnah has been able tosecure complete bacving from Moslem League, and that is ofthe. first importance in relation to the .decision we now have to ta^e.   He has been successful in overcoming any-opposition from the majority provinces, and both Sivendarand Nazimuddin (Fazlul Huq being absent) personallysubscribed to the unanimous decision reached by theLeague.   Neither Craiv nor Zafrullah Khan think thatSivendar could now be detached (Jinnah having met himover participation by members of the League in.War .Committees).   There, has been general support from suchMoslem press as there is for the line taven by Jinnah andby the League and there is not the least sign of anyrevolt against him.   Nor would! anticipate an earlyrevolt. . While fortunately he did not make   the non-transfer of defence to an Indian Minister his pretext fordeclining to accept our proposals, he has with great s^illbased his rejection of them on communal grounds which arelively to appeal to the ordinary Moslem constituent and onwhich it would be most difficult for Punjab and Bengal(even if they want to, of which I see no sign) to come out against him.   He has further aggravated position as against-TELEGRAM from Governor-General to Secretary of State forIndia, dated 8th October 1940.
the ;Congress and Mahasabha, and reduced the livelihood ofany amicable agreement between these parties at a later stage, since in effect what be has claimed has beenimplementing of the &quot;two-nations&quot; theory and recognitionof full equality between the Hindu and Moslem &quot;nationals&quot;in this country.5.      I am satisfied after most careful consideration andin the light of such soundings as I have been able to tavethat, given the present solidity of Moslem League behindJinnah and on the programme chained out in BombayResolutions, there is no prospect (a) of a split inside the League of which we could tave advantage; (b) of our being able to detach a couple of sufficiently represent-ative members of the League for inclusion in my ExecutiveCouncil nor, even were it easy (and I do not thin1&quot; itwould be) for us to endeavour to stimulate a split inside the League, do I thin1r that that, on a long view ofpolitical situation, would be wise or desirable.It is I :suspect of real importance to veep togethersome authoritative mouth-piece of general Moslem opinion in this country (and there is nothing that in any waycompares with League for that purpose at the moment - its authority and its cohesion have been consolidated out ofall recognition during last 12 months) more particularlyin view of possible post-war constitutional discussions.Nor do we want, at a time when we may have to tave theCongress on, unnecessarily to antagonise the main .organ-isation of second largest party and community in &quot;thiscountry.6.      On assumption then (a) that we cannot hope for-anyMoslem support or representation in my Council or war advisory Council (both Craiv and Zafrullah Khan agree asto this); (b) that it would be impossible to claim that&quot;expanded Council if it contained neither Congress nor the moslem League (nor possibly the Mahasabha) was at allreasonably representative of general opinion in this country,I have again carefully reviewed the whole situation.-  I have discussed the position individually with members of my ownCouncil, I have also been able to consult Craik and&apos;JamSahib,- and I have taven a variety of other soundings,recognising as I do the seriousness of:the issue, and difficulty of decision we have to ta1re.7,      The conclusion, to which with the utmost regret I amdriven, is that we cannot wisely, in the circumstances that confront us, go ahead on the basis of eitheralternative (1) or alternative (2) discussed in my  &apos;telegram of 22nd September.   At the same time while, it islamentable that reluctance of parties here to acceptschemes universally recognised outside as generouslydrawn should make  .it impossible for us to proceed with them,it would I thinv be a mistake to accept defeat to the extentof dropping our proposals altogether.   The course I would,in the circumstances, advocate would be a modification of alternative (3) in my telegram of 22nd September, underwhich the scheme as sketched out in my statement of 8thAugust would remain in being as our considered offer toIndia but would be held in suspense and would not be implemented until we get such degree of general support as would ensure that expanded Executive Council and war advisory Council were reasonably representative.    I should regard that degree of support as constituted by adherence to our scheme of either of the great parties - Congressor Moslem League.   In any announcement I would suggest that
leiwe should recapitulate what has ta^en place, set outconflicting claims put forward by Moslem League, theMahasabha, and Congress, reiterate the value and import-anee of our offer, which in fact represents beginning ofCabinet Government and the end of bureaucratic government at the Centre, express our regret that through circum-stances for which we could ta^e no blame there was clepr&quot;.yly no immediate prospect of our putting together an expanded Central Council sufficiently representative tojustify our making the change; and proceed that while itwas with sincere regret that we were forced to thatconclusion, His Majesty&apos;s Government still remained ofopinion that the scheme they had put forward represented the -only really sound and practicable line of advance,that they did not therefore propose to withdraw thescheme, which would hold the field as the consideredproposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government, iand that theytrusted that further reflection and a fuller appreciation of the value of what had been offered would lead to asufficient readiness to tave advantage of the scheme tojustify its being implemented.8.       In reaching this conclusion, I have not exceptedthe very serious arguments against.   Those are set outin more detail in paragraph 5 of my telegram of September22nd, and. points there emphasised (though we are nowdealing with a slightly different position from thehypothetical position that we were examining at thatdate) have lost little of their force.   By putting ourscheme into, cold storage we. must inevitably incur some loss, of prestige.   We do run very near admitting that ifthe two great, parties in British India are opposed to aparticular.scheme and.decline to wor1^ it, their refusalmust be taven as final.   We are to some extent going bac^. on our statement that if we could not get everyone to worvwith us whom we wanted, we would:worv with those who were-prepared to cooperate, and as you. will remember, I gaveJinnah to understand that-we were going ahead (though theattitude of Mahasabha, though not subsequently declared,and. the fact that... if it will not come in on terms offeredwe-have all three major parties -standing out, could be advanced as a new.factor since that conversation).   BothAney ana Ambed^ar will have an understandable grievanceagainst us .(1 am not much concerned about the Mahasabhasince they have to some extent put themselves out of court, by their unwisdom in putting, these exaggerateddemands). -Most important of all, the reflection on the capacity of India for self-government will be a veryserious one; and, equally grave in terms of the future,we shall have accepted a situation which brings out, inthe most emphatic way, the extreme improbability of its being possible at any. future time to secure agreementbetween parties here as to constitutional progress forInd ia.Finally, there is the point which I have alwaysregarded as one of real danger, that if we abandon ourpresent proposal and carry on as at present with abureaucratic Central Government, with a leavening of non-officials, we shall sooner or later find ourselves understrong pressure at home and here for a different solutionof the Constitutional problem based probably on our schemeof August 8th as a jumping off point.
9.       On the other hand, in favour of course which I haveadvocated there are following considerations:- (a) As I have explained above, it is clear now that there is no hope of ourgetting any really representative Moslems who- will disregard the League&quot;s decision - and Jinnah&apos;s victory at Bombay and   ihis roping in of Si^endar and Nazimuddin entitle   him to claim that he has Moslem opinion solidly behind him, as indeed!I believe he has.   I have been impressed in this connectionbv representations I have had from Chhatari who is essentiallthe type&quot; of moderate Moslem who has been most anxious to cooperate throughout.   Ke strongly urges abandonment of expansion in the present circumstances.   He represents thatMahasabha if taven into the Council without Moslems, would bring us.no strength because they have no following; thattheir inclusion.at the same time would certainly irritate tneMo si em s;-: that introduction of Moslems from outside the moslem league would be regarded as an affront to latter, and mightinstead of bringing further support to our war activitiescreate difficulties for us, and finally that there would berisv in such circumstances of a Congress-League coalition inthe Assembly.against expanded Council.(b) There is no hope In present circumstances ofexpanded Council, even if in addition to Aney and scheduledcastes we have Mahasabha, getting anything even remotelyapproaching a wording majority in-Central Legislature and thais a point of real importance.- I thinv myself too that thereis force in Chhatari&apos;s apprehension I have just - mentioned -&apos;(and I touched on same point- in paragraph 4 of my&apos;tel eg ran:of 22nd September) that there&quot;might be a. determined effort on the part of both majority.parties in Assembly to combineagainst new Government or.try to/raa^e it ridiculous.&apos;(c) Expansion of Council by addition of Aney,Ambedvar,a .Siv&apos;h and a Mahasabha would leave me (if, as 1believe to be the Case, we could secure no representativeMoslem) with one Moslem member only (and&apos; he from a sect hotwell.seen by orthodox-Moslems) out of-11.   While Moslemswould have, themselves, to- than^ for that, that would be unlikely to secure -us from acute Moslem criticism andJealousy.of so marked, a Hindu preponderance. . The closerelation&apos;of Mahasabha with Congress (compare Moonje&apos;sstatement In. paragraph 4 of my telegram of 17th September,-No. 1889-S.,- as to his conversations with Pa tel, while&apos;he has just appealed publicly to -Congress to join the Mahasabhaagainst.the pretensions- of- the Moslem League) would add tothis.   It is arguable too that mere addition of Aney,Ambed^ar,- a Si^h and even a Mahasabha would have little effect on character of my Council where non-official opinion is already represented byMudaliar and Zafrulla and that whatis really required Is presence of representatives of theleading and major political parties.(d) I am deeply impressed by the general assumption inthe press and in political quarters so far as I:have been ableto sound them, that in the circumstances that now confront us the scheme would- be dropped, and by quite surprising lac^ ofdisappointment at that possibility.   One would indeed almostbe justified in -saying that the general feeling is one of &apos;relief.   Every party, is I suspect secretly at ease that itsopponents-should&apos;not have, got into power while it itselfremained outside; secondly, that it has-been able to shuffleoff responsibility for taking a share of the burdens of theGovernment.   As I have mentioned above the general sense ofmy colleagues accords with public opinion and the press -that we should do better, as we can get no support that matters, not to go ahead.
(e) While I felt it important earlier in the summerthat we should ma^e a move and show our&apos;anxiety to associate Indians more closely with the responsibilityfor the conduct of the war and give such assurances inrelation to the constitutional advance as could safelyand appropriately be given at such a juncture, I feelthat we are now in a position to say that we have made c1^own bona fides, and our own anxiety to associate Inaianson a practical basis with the conduct of the war, clearbeyond any question.We can claim to have put forward proposals whichworld opinion and opinion.at home res accepted as beingwholly reasonable and that if we have failed to secure acceptance of those proposals&apos; it is through no fault ofour own.   The reflection on Indian political capacity andon their readiness to.accept the burden of responsibilityis indeed a very grave one.   The omens for Indians being able to get together on any basis of agreement after thewar in relation to the future constitution of thiscountry are again disquieting to a degree.   Since we must&quot;face that and much as we may resent the attitude of congress, the Moslem League and even the iviahasabha thereis no question about it that the first two bodies dorepresent political opinion in this country.   Every effort,that has been made to*break their control has failed:the moderates are of no importance in my judgment andhave never been able to stand up to the Congress machineon the one hand or Moslem League machine on the other.  ,I do not myself believe that we can hope now or in thefuture to put through a ..scheme. whether constitutional orother to which Congress (so.long as it retains its presentimportance) and Moslem League (so long as it retains itspresent cohesion and.solidity) are- opposed.   That is of very great importance in relation to future constitutional .development since development   towards which we have beenendeavouring to - move&apos; has been one under which there would- \be a much greater delegation to India itself ofresponsibility for controlling its affairs.   But I need-   -----not develop that-point now.    I would- only add that I-&apos;   &quot; .--regard political parties as being much more concerned&apos;at   &apos;the moment to maintain their position against one another&apos;both immediately and in relation to any post-warconstitutional discussions than to work together in a&quot;national&quot;-Government, or on a basis of unity.(f) So far as war effort is concerned, I doubt if now-that profound divisions between parties and against one&apos;another have again been emphasised, we are likely to beany worse off after breakdown of our proposals- if we carry,on very much as at present than if we were to endeavourto force our scheme, or some modification of it through.I am indeed apprehensive that effect on war effort of trying to force the pace might-be unfortunate, forCongress at the moment show increasing signs of concentrating on industrial labour, while Gandhicomplained bitterly to. me of our scheme for compulsory insurance against war.risks.   Their tactics may well&apos;prove to be an attempt at interference with war manu-facture and production and while I am satisfied that wecan deal with this successfully, I do not want more on my hands in doing so than we could help.(g)/ ,     -  -
(e) Finally (and&apos;&apos;this is an aspect of the situation that hasdefined itself precisely in these last few days) we do not Wiowwhere we shall stand in the near future in relation to Congress.We might very well have trouble with them though i snail ofcourse do my utmost to avert it.   If however we do have troublethere is everything to be said for not having alienated the moslem League.   I suspect that the League would be quitecontent to remain out of Office on the basis of their lauestresolutions with a mild grievance against us for not concedingtheir impossible demands.   Apart from that I do not thmv thatour relations with them are lively to be any worse tnan theyhave been in the past.   But an endeavour to split them, todetach prominent personalities from their ranvs or to go ahead with expansion leaving the League out might very well produce,a different state of things.10.     Let me discuss one further point and that is the risVthat we shall in the inevitable development of events find ourselves before long under renewed pressure here and at home to make   some further advance starting probably from our proposals of August 8th.   When I drafted my telegram ofSeptember 22nd I was disposed to taVe the risV of pressure of-,that type from the Indian end rather more seriously than on thewhole l do now.   That we shall get that pressure th.-.re can be noquestion.   It would be too much to hope that political, parties would be content to remain static and acquiesce in an indefinite continuance of the.present state of things.   But inthe light of the press reactions to the Moslem LeagueResolutions and to the terms of those resolutions, and of the revised resolutions of Mahasabha, I am less inclined than Iwas to worry unduly about political pressure here.   that pressure I would now judge to be lively to continue as atpresent to be essentially in terms of politics of particularparties.   Congress would continue to press for independence and for majority democratic rule with all that it implies.The Moslems (so far as they want any change) will continue,to urge that&apos;it can only be on the basis embodied in theirlatest Bombay resolutions and on the two nations theory.    The .Mahasabha will be concerned essentially to secure that no scheme shall be accepted of a character that would be livelyto satisfy Moslems,   In other words there would be no. unitedpressure for a common scheme; and parties will, as at present,remain deeply committed to demands wholly inconsistent with one another and incapable of realisation unless we were totave sides and baO one party against the rest.   We may, onthe other hand, at this end anticipate a certain amount ofunmanageable criticism, more particularly from &quot;Statesman&quot;,which without quite appreciating what is involved ordifficulties to be overcome has for some time past beenadvocating a &quot;national&quot; government, and that without such agovernment Indians war effort cannot really properly be developed.   That however I see nothing for it, but to face.11.       I cannot of course judge how much pressure may beanticipated on His Majesty&apos;s Government from home end.   ButI should have hoped that, given pains they have been taking to try to satisfy all reasonable demands, and complete lacvof any response from major parties, public opinion generally would be satisfied that we have done what we can and wouldbe more prepared than previously to acquiesce in stalemateposition in which we find ourselves.   As for any further advance I am sure that I am interpreting your mind and thatof Cabinet in saying that I tave it as axiomatic that wemust stand entirely fast on offer of 8th August, and thatthere can be no question of any improvement or extension of
that offer.   On proposals I have made above it would remain in shop window but it would be clearly understoodthat there is no intention to make   it more attractive inany way and that it represents limit to which we aresatisfied that we can wisely go in present conditions and that clearest indication of impossibility of goingfurther is constituted by reactions to it of majorIndian political parties.12.        I fear War Advisory Council must go the way ofexpanded Executive Council.   We could not hope to secureCongress membership of it.   Equally we could not hope tosecure Moslem League: while demands of Mahasabha interms of seats are preposterous.   I am certain in anycase that War Council by itself would not really fill the bill.13. We shall have carefully to consider terms ofany statement to be made once Cabinet have settled policy,   if you and they agree with my recommendationsabove, I would not be in any particular hurry to announce.   There is a good deal of speculation as towhat we are going to do, but not much pressure behind it,and there might well be much to be said for postponingany announcement until late in month.14. Our announcement when it comes will of course have to reiterate our readiness to help to get peopletogether.   I have again considered whether there is anything to be said for mentioning in it our anxiety tosee preliminary discussions started between the partieswithout further delay with a view to clearing the ground for post-war constitutional discussions.   But to do soat a time when parties are again wholly and publicly atodds with one another and when there is no sign whateveron the part of any of them of a readiness to scale downand adjust their mutual conflicting claims seems to meto be lively to be misunderstood, and on the whole there-fore I would be against any such reference.   I would ofcourse be most ready to revert to this suggestion whensigns are more propitious.

MOSLEM LEAGUE RESOLUTION OF SEPTEMBER 28th, 1940Working Committee of Moslem League in Bombay meetingon September 2nd after considering the Viceroys letter dated August 14th to the President, containing specificoffer regarding expansion of Executive Council and establishment of War Advisory Council had reauested viceroy to reconsider the matter and had authorised President toseev further information and clarification of controversyon points set out in resolutions before Committee could dealwith the offer,   as result of communication of theseresolutions to Viceroy he invited the president to meet him&apos;on September 24th and after full free discussion of points arising from those resolutions sent formal reply dated september 25th.   After giving most earnest carefulconsideration to the whole matter, Committee notwithstandingdesire from the very beginning to help the prosecution ofwar and the defence of India, regret inability to acceptthe present offer for the following reasons:(1) inclusion of only two League representatives inexpanded Executive Council of which neither total strengthnor number of additional members has yet been definitelydetermined, gives no real substantial share in authority of central Government..(2) No indication has been given of position of Leaguerepresentation, if any other party later decided to assistprosecution of war and Government agreed to associate it with Executive Council which may involve substantial modification and reshuffling of Executive.(3) Government do not yet propose to appoint non-official advisers in Section 93 provinces.   Committee feel that without the association of League representatives in theadministration of those provinces real effective cooperationof Mussalmans impossible.(4) proposed War advisory Council is yet in.embryo, andno information is available regarding constitution,composition and functions, except that there will probablybe about 20 members, and that the question of setting it up will be considered after expansion of the ExecutiveCouncil is complete.(5) That of various points in Committee&apos;s resolution ofSeptember 2nd, only one relating to panel has been satisfactorily met.HINDU MAHASABHA RESOLUTION OF SEPTEMBER 22nd, 1940.In view of opportunity that present war offers forgeneral militarisation of Hindus and organisation of systemof India on sound modern lines so that India may be converted into self-contained defence unit, Mahasabha isprepared wholeheartedly to wor1^ out schemes of expansion of executive Council and War Advisory Council but on honourableterms of equity and justice as follows:(1) In view of Moslem League&apos;s declaration that partit-ion of India is only solution of India&apos;s future constitutionMahasabha urges Viceroy to make clear and definite declarat-ion that Government has not approved or accepted any such scheme.
(2) .    In view of reported understanding between viceroy and Moslem League that League, would receive two seats onExecutive Council and five seats on War Advisory Council.Mahasabha claims six seats on Executive Council and fifteenseats on Advisory Council on population basis.   Of these sixseats one should be given to Si^hs, one to Scheduled Castes,and remainder to Mahasabha nominees.(3)      Committee considers Moslem League demand of 50 percent, representation on Executive Council and elsewhereundemocratic, unconstitutional, unreasonable and preposterousand urges Viceroy to assure Mahasabha that no such demand would be entertained.
