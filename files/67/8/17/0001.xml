Nol,.P.(G) (40)817, August, 1940.WAR CABINET.INDIA AND the WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate herewith for the information of mycolleagues a summary prepared in my Office of comment inthe British Press and American reactions with regard tothe recent White Paper on India.L o S o A (19th.August,  1940.

- INDIAN WHITE PAPER *of 8th August ,1940. .Survey of Comment- in the British Press (London,Provincial and Weekly) and American reactions.Comment in the British Press is almost uniformly favourableand,  in many cases, enthusiastic, v...- \The concensus of opinion. is that,  in making, the present offer to India,&apos;a great: and notable step forward has been taken and it.is agreed that,  in present circumstances,  the-, assurance given by government could hardly be more explicit.       * * -The difficulty of settling constitutional issues.in the midstof the present conditions is recognised, but it is hoped that theoffer to associate Indian public opinion with the war and to expend the Indian Cabinet to. include party representatives will prove acceptable to India. . ,.As regards the American Press,  the British Library ofInformation (New York)  has telegraphed that the general reactionappears to be one of &quot;approval and a recognition of thedifficulties of British administration in India, tempered bycynicism regarding Britain&apos;s past promises and anomaly ofautocratic India in democratic war.      India is warned of worseplight if Britain loses *     Unfavourable Indian reaction isanticipated.uLONDON PRESS.THE TIMES states that the pronouncement made by-Mr. Amery isa &quot;substantial advance&quot;  on the policy of prcvi. us governments.    Itdraws particular attention to the desire to establish the now status&quot;under a new Conotituti n framed by Indians.&quot; This is a real,concession t - the spirit of &quot;the doniands of Indian leaders... .      THE. TIMES,however,  points out that consent to a new form of Constitutionmust be obtained from the majority of the people.    Therefore,  theConstituent Assembly suggested by Congress cannot be accepted asit does not command &quot;ge,neral assent&quot;.      If the proposal made bythe Viceroy is accepted,  there will be a unique opportunity forIndians to co-operate in framing a now Constitution.     .Theprocess will give  to India the dignity of free association enjoyed by the other Dominions of the Commonwealth.THE DAILY .TELEGRAPH emphasises that the White.Paper concedesthe main &quot;Congress demand that any new Constitution should be framed by Indians.    Indiars right of self-determination isacknowledged while India&apos;s security is guaranteed.&quot;. The steptaken &quot;goes to the utmost length consistent with reason andprudence&quot; and affords a magnificent opportunity to Indians to resolve their differences.      It also gives them the status towhich they have long aspired.THE DAILY EXPRESS says that.Mr.. Amery has made another step towards home rule for India.    &quot;Dominion Status has been offeredbefore but&apos;.Mr. Amery is a man who -keeps his promises.&quot;THE DAILY MAIL feels that the;- move is of great importance inthat it:is &quot;an attempt.to fuse the warring elements in indian political life into a body charged with prosecuting, harmoniouslythe greater war which threatens them all.&quot;THE/
THE DAILY HERALD admits that the &quot;offer to India&quot; goesfarther than the offer made last October, but does not satisfy the demands of Congress.     It considers that Mr. Amery&apos;s statement is a shelving of the &quot;new Constitution&quot; until after the war huthalf-heartedly admits the value of the new War Council which itis proposed should be set up.    It considers that the BritishGovernment is &quot;playing off the Moslem leaders against Congress&quot;.LATER COMMENT.Referring to the Congress President&apos;s statement that hefinds &quot;no scope for further discussion&quot; in the British offer, the&quot;Daily Herald&quot; (13th August,1940)  asks whether &quot;if it were made clear to him that an offer is put forward as a basis of negotia-tion, that there is no question of &apos;take it or leave it&apos;  wouldha then find &apos;scope&apos;?&quot;   The paper says:  &quot;Britain will win thewar.    But victory would be brought immensely nearer if, even now,she could obtain the whole-hearted collaboration of India.&quot;The Congress leaders are ready to give that collaboration.But they state terms.     And the British Government&apos;s latest offerfalls far short of those terms.&quot;What, then,  is to happen?   Must we accept deadlock? Cannotthe parties come.nearer to one another, since each so clearlyrealises the value of agreement, the folly of dispute and the wastage of delay?...... .The &quot;Working Committee of Congress is tomeet next Sunday.    It will then draw up its formal reply to. theoffer.&quot;Every indication at present is that the reply will be a refusal.&quot;The British Government should make on attempt to forestallsuch a reply,.&quot;It should indicate clearly that the last week&apos;s offer isnot its last word.&quot;THE NEWS CHRONICLE&quot; says the step which the British Governmenthas taken my &quot;with goodwill on both sides hasten the day on whichIndia achieves Dominion Status.&quot;     The moment chosen for the change is &quot;propitious&quot;..   Unlike the changes made by the totalitarianleaders, the white Paper shows that we can make changes for the betterment of mankind.     The step token furnishes grounds for indian progress and development and,  if accepted by indian leaders, the Executive Council proposed may form &quot;the nucleus of a body which will draft at least the lines along which theConstituent Assembly shall be selected.&quot;LATER COMMENT.Urging an offer of immediate discussions that would quicklylead to Dominion Status, the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; (13th August,1940)writes: -&quot;It is true that, when Britain has won this war, India willfaave a more certain opportunity of that ;complete autonomy shedesires than she has ever had before,      It is equally true that,  .if Germany were to win, that certainty would not even he a hope. . i&quot;All the more reason,  therefore, why Britain should putIndia on our side beyond all argument;    and why she should puther there now     An offer of immediate discussions that wouldquickly lead to Dominion Status would he interpreted by all but our enemies as a sign of great moral strength^  and do more than anywords con even hope to do to convince the world of our sincere
P&apos; oboPROVINCIAL . PRE S3THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN says that &quot;the proposals ofGovernment mark a new advance with regard to the making and thecharacter of the new Constitution&quot;c      The &quot;representative Indians&quot;who are to be asked to work with the Government will be enablednow to determine the method by which the &quot;new Constitution&quot; willbe chosen.      The terms of the White Paper&apos; appear to meet thedemands of all friends of India in this country*      It affords anopportunity to bring about agreement which will have far reachingresults.This paper considers the interim proposals as less satisfactory&quot;.    Instead of the Viceroy &quot;inviting&quot;  representativeIndians? it would prefer that they be &quot;elected&quot; by their owncountrymen, in which case they would be truly &quot;representative&quot;.Congress should realise the importance of the essence of theproposals which is &quot;the promise of a post-war Constitution whichIndians will themselves devise&quot;.THE LIVERPOOL DAILY POST says the announcement &quot;represents a most important effort to give unity of direction to politicalfeeling in India.     Although Indian politicians are    not verytractable and are divided among themselves, the circumstancesof the time ought to favour the acceptance of the far-reachingoffer&quot;.     There is now &quot;an opportunity of making sure of thedevelopment of India on democratic lines.     What Britain offersrepresents a tremendous experiment&quot;.THE BIRMINGHAM POST speaks of the. new declaration as &quot;perhaps the most generous single approach we have ever made to India&quot;.-THE YORKSHIRE POST says the declaration &quot;represents asincere and enlightened gesture on Britain&apos;s behalf to India&quot;.;Indian leaders should &quot;recognise that this is no grudgingconcession.    It represents the will - of the British people&quot;.By withholding full support from Britain&apos; before obtainingcomplete independence, Congress &quot;is in grave danger of throwingaway the substance of political freedom which the Viceroy&apos;declaration offers, for the shadow of an independence which couldnot be maintained&quot; without the protection afforded by membership of the British Commonwealth.THE GLASGOW HERALD says that the declaration made by Mr.   -Amery is &quot;full of good sense and approaches the future of india as a dominion of the British Commonwealth in the only way thatis politically realistic&quot;.If the pronouncement had been made at the beginning of thewar it would probably have been accepted by Congress,  out theleaders have now &quot;drifted nearer to complete non-co-operation,and it may not be very eary for them to accept Lord Linlithgow&apos;invitation&quot;.      However, they realise the menace of Hitler andalso, of Japan, and the White Paper gives them almost everythingthey can reasonably ask if &quot;they will consent to work for it&quot;.\ &quot;THE SUSSEX DAILY NEV^ points out that&apos;, &quot;if Indian politicsare confused at the moment/the Indian war effort Is firm andconcentrated&quot;.THE/desire to create a better world for all men.      It is not too latefor real statesmanship to grasp this opportunity and turn it to account.11
THE SHEFFIELD TELEGRAPH expresses appreciation of theBritish Government&apos;s offer which amounts to an appeal forco-operation at the time when &quot;while the future of the world isat stake there is neither time nor opportunity to devote to working out a Constitution.     Much of what Britain has done forIndia has been overlooked both here and in India.    India isoffered something definite and immediate on the road to self-government&quot; .THE WESTERN MAIL (Cardiff)  welcomes the offer and says itaffords &quot;a sound and substantial basis on which Congress andall the other interests can work for the common aim of all&quot;.Governments policy of forming a War Advisory Council representa-tive of all Indian interests, will enable India to take an&quot;effective part in the prosecution of the war ... The firstreactions from some Indian politicians are not as encouragingas they might have been, combat after mature deliberation andin further talks with the Viceroy they ma3A come to realise thatthey are offered a plan of free and orderly development whichit would be a betrayal of the best interests of Indians to reject&quot;.THE NEWCASTLE JOURNAL says the sincerity of the Britihoffer should help Indian leaders to realise that co-operationwith us is &quot;preferable to taking the&apos; risk of the totalitariandomination they have condemned&quot;.   This paper characterises thewhite Paper on India as &quot;an appeal to reason delivered at a mount when the freedom of the future of every individualin that great country is menaced by the common foe.&quot;THE DAILY DISPATCH (Manchester) says the offer will be a test of Indian statesmanship to make the step taken &quot;as big astride as   possible&quot;.THE WESTERN DAILY PRESS    (Bristol)  says &quot;though LordLinlithgow&apos;s offer goes beyond any previously made,  it can be implemented only if the parties consent to abandon the extremepositions which they hove hitherto taken up.   For the congress party, Lord Linlithgow1s offer means the concession in principleof one of its most important demands, for the Moslems it means a reinforcement of the guarantees against the undue use  ofpolitical power to their detriment... There is nothing &quot;butpolitical obduracy to prevent all sections co-operating forthwith in the work of the Central Government and helping to direct itsconduct ofthe war&quot;.THE EVENING NEWS (Portsmouth)  says Britain is willing &quot;asthe head of a great Imperial family to set India on its feet&quot;but must act as a trustee for all the parties.      It advisesIndia to regard the present world conditions in a. realisticspirit and to act accordingly.WEEKLY PRESS.THE SUNDAY TIMES.    Mr. J.A.Spender, writing in this paperbelieves that        Amery&apos;s pronouncement &quot;will be generally taken as proof of our serious resolve to make India an integral partof the free world which is the goal of our effort&quot;.After pointing out the difficulties inherent in providing a suitable  form of self-government for India owing to trhemultiplicity of languages, religions and   peoples in &quot;different-stages of culture and civilisation&quot;, Mr. Spender says,  &quot;v?e know from experience that to leave unsolved minority problems &amp;o anewly-constituted Federal Assambly, would be to doom it f roomthe/
the outset,  and are therefore obliged to say that theirsettlement in advance and if possible by Indians themselves,is a prior condition of any successful Constitution11.&quot;The chief merit of the Viceroy&apos;s proclamation is that it takes a substantial step forward on the road to partnershipand equality of status.     Looking to the future it promisesBritish aid - not British dictation - in forming a constitution which shall be essentially Indian in the sense that it will bereached by agreement between the Indian parties...   We may look for an immediate response from important and responsible mennot committed deeply to Indian party politics and after thiskeep the door open to increasing co-operation as the realities of the situation are better understood.     It does not appearto have occurred to Mr. Gandhi that realisation of even a partof Congress&apos;s aspirations is only possible if we prevent theEuropean dictators from becoming masters of India...    If the conviction comes to India,  as it will,  that her salvation, likeours, depends on winning the war, her fighting races, whetherHindu or Moslem, will not be content with the part of peacefulspectators behind the British shield.&quot;        Therefore &quot;theViceroy must not wait on Gandhi but must push forward&quot; withthe new scheme   and &quot;enlist the best men he can, to whateverparty they may belong.&quot;THE SUNDAY OBSERVER says, &quot;The question for India is whether it will be better for India to be outside or inside theBritish Commonwealth of Nations.     As a member of the Common-wealth with Dominion Status there would be all the essentialsof independence with the added security and hope enjoyed bythe other members of the Commonwealth...    The time has come toforge an immediate link of Anglo-Indian co-operation in bothwinning the war and in sharing the fruits of victory...    It isa remarkable illustration of the elasticity, vitality,  andsoundness of the British Commonwealth, that so momentous a step forward in constitutional development, can be formulated inthe middle of a war in which that Commonwealth itself is fightingfor its    life.&quot;   Tribute is paid to the &quot;wisdom&quot;, courage, and confidence of Mr. Amery with his deep and comprehensiveknowledge of the Empire as a whole.      It is fortunate, too,that Mr. Churchill,  at a moment when his energies are strained,should, with sure judgment, divert his driving power tolaunching what may well prove in the later stages cf the war to be a decisvely contributory factor to the triumph cf theCommonwealth and its ideals.&quot;      India may play an essentialrole in this war&quot;both geographically and politically.   As an integral part of the British Commonwealth she may help to savecivilisation itself.&quot;THE NEW STATESMAN AND NATION,  while admitting the advancewhich the present white Paper makes on anything which came from lord Zetland, considers it seriously inadequate and that it willprobably not achieve the reconciliation of India.      Incommenting upon the announcement THE NEW STATESMAN says:  &quot;Itsgood points deserve, none the less, to be underlined.      Itstone  is friendly and it avoids the magisterial manner thatIndians specially resent.      It frankly faces the fact that thegulf between Congress and the Muslim League cannot now bebridged.     It abandons the disastrous policy of using theirdisagreement as an excuse for indefinite delays.     What the.British Government will grant,  it gives at once without exactingunanimity among Indians as a preliminary condition.    There isalso an advance in the terms of the promise of the future constitution,  for we take its meaning to be that a representative body of Indians shall draw it up, following a procedure of theirown choosing.       That is a real advance, though we hold thatthis/
this representative body should he got together before theend of the war&quot;.THE SPECTATOR considers that the Viceroy&apos;s statement is .&quot;potentially of capital importance&quot;.    It. narrows the gulfbetween the demands of Indian nationalists and the concessions which Britain has hitherto felt able to make.      Theannouncement comes at a time when India realises the Nazimenace and is &quot;conscious of her own defencelessness&quot;,Membership of the British Commonwealth moans more thanindependence?, for with independence go the &quot;benefits of freeco-operation&quot;.     All this is offered to India.One important thing about the present announcement is thatit is free from the vagueness1 of previous statements.   Thoessentials aro present, i.o. &quot;a fixed goal. Dominion Status; a fixed date, the end of the War;   and a fixed method,  the adoption of anew Constitution by a representative Indian body&quot;.    Tnisproposal should &quot;open the way to a new and unreserved, co-operation with Indians in the war effort&quot;.AMERICAN REACTIONS.THE NEw YORK TIMES says:  &quot;India deserves well of britain in view of her restraint.&quot;      It describes the Viceroy&apos;sassurances as &quot;improvements over vaguer promises of the past.Indian leaders themselves,  even those of tho Congress Party,must realise by now that Dominion Status confers  greateradvantages than full independence itself.      As long as Britishsea power can be maintained it can protect a free Indiandominion from the rapacity of German and Japanese conquerors,who would otherwise pounce on India like jungle tigers.      Thislatest British pronouncement gives a golden opportunity toIndia to find her own salvation if Britain survives this war.If the opportunity is lost it may never occur again.&quot;THE NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE AND THE NEW YORK SUN,   reviewing the Viceroy&apos;s concessions,  express appreciation of thedifficulties of the British position and also of Indianrestraint.      THE NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE says:  &quot;To reconcileCongress may well prove an impossible task.    Indians have shownhearty appreciation of the basic causes of the present war andreal sympathy with the British in their conflict with the Nazisand Fascists.&quot;THE ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH says:   &quot;Britain&apos;s intentionto give India free and equal partnership in the Empire afterthe War must be appraised in terms of past promises and thepresent extremity.      India&apos;s loaders must realise that  India&apos;future will be far more secure if the British win.    Otherwisethey will face a period of anarchy.&quot;THE OAKLAND TRIBUNE after citing difference of internalfactions,  of more than 200 languages and dialects,  concludes,&quot;It is confusing, but to Britain it is clear that she musstnot lose  &apos;&quot;ndio now.      It should be equally clear to India.nnationalists that no matter how just their democratic cauzse,they cannot break off from Britain in this war year,  if ttieyhope to retain oven their present degree of independence.&quot;THE BOSTON HERALD says:. &quot;The  offer is an effort-to persuade Gandhi and his followers to wont a British victory.The Indian problem is one of the most complicated the Britishhave ever faced... Their gesture towards India will be applaudeQdin the United States, regardless of the urgency of the occasionFROM/
