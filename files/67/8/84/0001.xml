MINISTRY   OF   LABOUR  AND   NATIONALSERVICEREPORTby theCommissioner for Man-Power Survey Sir William H. Beveridge, K.C.B.-with Annexed MemorandaOctober, 1940
To the Right Hon. the Minister ofof Labour and National Service.Sir,I have the honour to submit a Report on the Survey of Man-power which I undertook at your request at the end of June, 1940&apos;In obedience to the Prime Minister&apos;s Ordinance for &quot; Brevity &quot; jhave prefixed to the Report a list of Salient Points and I haveframed the Report itself in numbered paragraphs in which con-elusions are stated with a minimum of evidence and argument. Tosome, perhaps to many, of those who have to consider my Report,some, perhaps many, of the conclusions will appear unacceptable.&apos;I hope that any reader who finds any of the conclusions unaccept-able at first sight, before finally rejecting that conclusion, will readalso the appropriate supporting evidence as set out in the Memorandaannexed to my Report. Four of these Memoranda, described asPrincipal Memoranda, are printed at the end of the Report. Ofthe others, described as subsidiary, only brief summaries are printed;sufficient copies of each have been made for distribution to thosewho are likely to need them. Some of these Memoranda werewritten at an early stage of the Survey and have not been revised in view of later information. They bear the initials of the officers who wrote them.My Survey had to be planned and conducted at a time of extremepressure in every branch of wartime activity. As suiting the times,I adopted a self-denying ordinance against asking any persons engaged in the practical conduct of affairs, as managers of business,as trade union leaders, or as civil servants, to furnish special returns,reports or memoranda for the purpose of my Survey. The onlyexception to this is the report described in Memorandum F whichI obtained from each Divisional Controller of the Ministry of Labourand National Service, as to new factories in his Division, where he anticipated difficulties in the housing or transport of the necessary labour. Apart from this, all the official material used in my Surveyconsists of data collected by the Ministry of Labour, and certain other Departments, in the course of administration. Most of thenew material used in my Report and set out or summarised in - the memoranda, has been acquired through local surveys organised by Mr. G. D. H. Cole and conducted by investigators, of indepen-dent position, not already immersed in administration. The names and qualifications of these local investigators with the instructionsunder which they acted are set out in Memorandum S; they gavetheir services in all cases without remuneration; they were assisted in their task by welcome readiness of all concerned to place facts and experience at their disposal. No doubt many of the complaintsmade to the local investigators as to the actions of various Depart-ments of the Government can be met by satisfactory answers. Nodoubt particular statements appearing in their reports can be chal-lenged as incomplete or incorrect; they had neither time nor oppor-tunity to verify all the information supplied to them. But theywere&apos; asked to report only facts that appeared to them to be estab-lished, and they are responsible people.  There need be no hesitation
219in accepting the local surveys as fair general pictures of conditionsin Britain in July, 1940, and of the feelings and experiences of thevarious sections of the community. In addition to local surveys,special investigations were made by members of my staff at head-quarters into the possible openings for additional labour on the land,or in salvage operations and other special topics.In the main my Report is not statistical. The data essential fora statistical comparison of resources and requirements of man-powerare not available to-day; the task of making this comparison hasrecently been referred to a Committee of the Production Council,under my Chairmanship, and the new material needed is in course of collection. There are many special topics such as wages and earn-ings or hours of work or movement of labour -well suited to statis-tical study, and some new figures bearing on these topics will beavailable shortly. I hope to submit an analysis of these figures andof the result of the July exchange of books and the Industrial Regis-tration Order made last August, in a Supplementary Report. Mean-while, whatever the balance of resources and requirements of man-power, it can be assumed that any avoidable waste of man-power in war is an evil, a weakening at once of war effort and of civilianmorale. On this assumption, the Report which I now present dealsless with quantities than with problems of organisation.A Report of this nature is of necessity critical. In so vast astructure of administration as. that which is concerned with mobilis-ing the economic strength of the people for war, it is inevitable thatsome gaps and some weaknesses should appear; it is my business,if I can, to call attention to them, rather than to the strong points which need no attention. It would be superfluous for me to praisewhat has been accomplished in so many months of strenuous thought and action. Any practical value of my Survey must lie in suggest-ing, if possible, the ways in which yet more could be accomplished.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient servant,w. H. beveridge.5th October, 1940.
SALIENT POINTS IN REPORT OF MAN-POWERSURVEY(i) There is a substantial waste of man-power and other produc-tive resources in Britain to-day (para. 1 and Memorandum A).(ii) Some waste of man-power is inevitable in war, through misfitsand bottle-necks (para. 2 and Memorandum A).(iii) The actual waste of man-power is greater than is inevitable and could be decreased1 by changes of organisation (para. 3).(iv) The present organisation of war production leads to waste ofman-power, some of which appears to be avoidable, in the followingrespects:Location of new factories without sufficient regard to labour requirements (para. 5).Disproportionate building of new factories or extensions in place of adapting existing buildings and plant (para. 6).Over-centralisation, discontinuity and needless tendering in placing of contracts (para. 7).imperfect co-ordination of different factors of production(para. 8).Particularism of the units of production (para 9).(v) Organisation of production in war should be approached as a problem of converting the whole of the industrial capacity of thecountry (factories, machinery and labour) to national purposesrather than of placing contracts as in peace (para. 11).(vi) Dilution and the recruiting of women are still very limited in scope (para. 13).(vii) The general shortage of skilled engineers is accentuated inthe case of two super-skilled types, tool room workers and setters, whoare hard to train. Rigid economy in the use of such men is essential and depends upon the service and production departments and the managements. Training of those who can be trained is almost themost important task in the organisation of man-power; it must bedirected to definite objectives and in the right proportions (para. 14and Memorandum C).(viii) The high natural immobility of British labour and the ten-dency of workpeople to return home after a short absence are serious limitations to labour transfer. All citizens, not fighting menonly, must be prepared for suspension of family life in total war(para. 15)(ix) The State must take responsibility for a considered consistentpolicy on wages, incomes and the standard of consumption. Peace-time methods of determining wages do not suit the conditions of war,Control of employment pre-supposes control of wages (para. 16 and memorandum B).(x) The terms of civilian employment in war should differ fromthose of military service, but the principle of service should besubstituted for the motive of personal gain in each alike (paras, 17-18 and Memorandum B).
27225(xi) There must be effective unity of control over all labour questions exercised through the Ministry of Labour and NationalService, but based on intimate co-operation of the Ministry and theSupply Departments, and on stronger regional organisation (paras.19-21).(xii) The change of industrial structure involved in war calls for a strengthening of Employment Exchange organisation, to pro-mote change of occupations (paras. 22-23).(xiii) The State should undertake directly the organisation of surplus man-power in land reclamation and land improvement whichwill not otherwise be performed (paras. 24-25).(xiv) There is an unsatisfied demand for recruits in some of theWomen&apos;s Services. This does not present a serious problem to-day,but may do so in the future, when the demand for women in muni-tions grows. Adequate voluntary recruiting of women for the defence services may then prove impossible, unless measures are taken to keepthe terms of civilian employment and the terms of service in justrelation (para. 26).(xv) Creation of unemployment by restriction orders is an unsatisfactory way of obtaining labour and should be replaced byregistration and transfer direct from employment (para. 28).(xvi) London contains nearly one-fifth of the armament produc-tion of the country, other than shipbuilding, and more than one-fifth of the skilled engineers not already on Government work. Con-tinuing use, under nightly aerial attack, of this great productivecapacity can be assured only by measures of large scale evacuation of useless mouths and communal feeding and organised shelterhousing of those who are required to remain (paras. 29-33).(xvii) The peace-time economic and political structure has been continued into the war with too little change. Even at this late hour,large changes in the economic basis of our armament industriesduring the war would be worth while, in order to break down the wasteful particularism of the units of production and to make all men conscious servants of the community (paras. 33-36 and sViemo-randum D).

221I.-report . There is a substantial waste of man-power and other pro-ductive resources in Britain to-day.   In relation to man-power thisis shown  most  conspicuously  in  registered  unemployment,   as .analysed in Memorandum A, for not more than 85,000 of the j730,000 registered in August can be dismissed as unemployable; fit is shown in other less obvious ways (a) in the occupation ofpersons on unessential work;  (b) in the idleness of persons not normally occupied for gain but now offering themselves for nationalservice; (c) in failure to make the best use at all times of scarceforms of skill.    In relation to other productive resources, it is illustrated by Section on &quot; Unused Industrial Capacity &quot; in Memo-randum A, showing for two important Divisions of the country inJune, 1940, the large numbers and proportions of firms prepared toundertake additional government work.2. Some waste of man-power in war is inevitable. Passage frompeace to war involves a large and sudden change of industrial structure-ture and of occupations, to be carried out under conditions of scarcityand of dislocation by enemy attack. In these conditions, it is unreasonable to expect any system of organisation of the country&apos;economic life, however carefully planned, to be able to securecontinuous employment for all persons at all times. Some waste ormis-use of man-power, some unemployment due to the misfits andbottle-necks described in Memorandum A, is inevitable in war andis not a proof of faulty organisation.3. The actual waste of man-power and of other productive re-sources in Britain to-day is greater than is inevitable and could bereduced by changes of organisation. The main points in respectof which the present organisation appears capable of improvementare set out below under the four heads of Organisation of Pro-duction, Organisation of Labour, Machinery of Administra-tion and Use of Idle Manpower. The first two heads are different aspects of a single problem. Separated below for purposesof exposition, production and labour must be dealt with as a wholeby a single closely-knit organisation. To the four heads .namedabove, I have added a short section on London Life and Labourunder Air-Raids and a Conclusion of a general character as tothe conduct of total war.ORGANISATION OF PRODUCTION.4. Under the present organisation of production in war, waste ofman-power which could be avoided arises under several heads setout in paragraphs 5 to 9. The design of any complicated mechanismof war, whether it be an aeroplane or a system of organising man-power, cannot be expected to be perfect before trial. Nothing butexperience in either case can test it. In each case, experienceinvariably discovers weaknesses and suggests changes.
5. Location of new factories without sufficient regard to labour requirements.Concentration of large proportions of the total war productionin particular limited areas involves acute congestion of housing andtransport facilities, as well as strain upon organs of distribution and public service. Coventry is the leading instance to-day andillustrates excellently the choice of evils which is usually the most that war allows. Concentration of so large a part of new armamentproduction in an established engineering centre like Coventry was due, no doubt, among other reasons, to the hope of each firmconcerned that it could more readily find there the highly skilled labour required. But this means importing semi-skilled and un-skilled men and women to dilute or assist the skilled men, in numbers making their housing and transport a problem of the firstmagnitude. An alternative plan of building some of the new fac-tories in places where the less skilled labour is abundant andmoving some of the skilled men to them, would have avoided this difficulty. Parts of Lancashire and Cheshire may present evenmore difficulties in a few months&apos; time than Coventry. similar problems arise not as to whole areas, but as to particular factories which have been placed in remote and inaccessible districts, with-out adequate housing and transport facilities.From reports of the Divisional Controllers and of the Surveyinvestigators, a list of factories in respect of which difficulties areanticipated, has been prepared and is set out in Memorandum F.The existence of these difficulties does not mean that no attempt wasmade to prevent them from arising. There were regular arrange-ments for consultation of the Ministry of Labour by the production department, as to the most suitable location of factories, having re-gard to the supply of labour. If, nevertheless, difficulties of labour supply through location have occurred or are anticipated, this can be explained by several reasons. First, strategic considerations dictatedsome shifting of industry-the emptying of certain regions of thecountry and crowding of others. Second, consultation in practicewas not equally effective with all the Production Departments orbranches and by all of them objections made by the Ministry ofLabour were sometimes over-ruled on other grounds. Third, even when the general region within which the factory was to be placedwas agreed on as suitable, the precise site chosen and the scale andlayout of the factory itself have sometimes been such as to make thetask of getting the necessary labour to its place of work needlesslydifficult. Fourth, and perhaps most surprising of all, there appearsto have been no power of any kind to control the location of a factoryby a private firm; several of the cases of exceptional difficulty nowanticipated relate to factories placed in this way without consultationwith the Ministry of Labour or in defiance of its views. Fifth, theextent of the difficulty of transferring labour under war conditionswas probably not fully appreciated even by the Ministry of Labouritself and has become apparent only through experience.
Having regard to this experience, in so far as it is still possibleto reconsider locations or lay-outs which may lead to difficulty, thisshould now be done. In so far as the sites of new factories cannotbe changed, there is now no escape in some cases from the loss of productive power which is involved either in building additionalhouses near the site for the workers or in organising transport forthem and occupying a substantial portion of their time in travel. Allthat can be done in such cases is to reduce the loss to a minimum,making it the responsibility of some one department, with adequatepower, to see that all the problems of getting the workers to and fromtheir work under conditions of black-out and aerial attack are con-sidered in advance and that solutions are found.6. Disproportionate building of new factories or extensions in placeof utilising existing buildings and plant.In a war, every person responsible for each particular piece of munition production (whether for aeroplanes or guns or ammunition)prefers, if possible, to have a new factory, placed and plannedaccording to his desires, instead of taking over and converting anold one. That is most advantageous for each item of productionconsidered by itself. But it is not the best way of getting maximum production of all kinds. It may lead, and under conditions of war-time scarcity does lead, to an attempt by the country as a whole toincrease its capital equipment in war to an impossible extent, and towaste of existing equipment and skill. The list of new factories orextensions now building or proposed for building is formidable inmore senses than one. To-day some factories, taxed to capacity,are crying out for additional labour or machines; not a few of thesethrough their situation, will find needless difficulty in meeting their requirements. At the same time, the owners of other factories arecrying out for contracts to use the labour or the machines that theyhave. The issue raised in the last war, between moving workpeoplefrom the factories where they were at work to other factories and distributing work to the factories where the workpeople were tobe found, is being raised once more. No doubt many small firmsunder-estimate the difficulties of the work which they desire to perform. No doubt also some transference of men from the places in which they are now working to new factories is inevitable, but every transfer involves a definite loss to set against the expected gains.Moving of men to the work rather than moving work to the men,means waste of factory space and, except in so far as it is possible totransfer machinery as well as the men, it means waste of machinery.It loses the organising and directing power of their present em-ployers, and the team spirit and goodwill of the establishment. Itmay cause unnecessary unemployment. Where the new place of em-ployment is at a distance, transfer of workpeople raises also difficultieseither of housing or of transport and lowers the efficiency of pro-duction, as well as increasing the cost through additional expenditure for lodgings or travel. Such transfers in many cases involve diffi-culties about wages through differences of the rate between differentdistricts. Finally, through breaking up of home life, either by livingapart or by excessive hours of work and travel, they lead to unsettle-ment and discontent.
7. Contracting Methods.The reports of Local Investigators contain many criticisms of con-tract policy, under the three main heads of over-centralisation, dis-continuity, and needless tendering. Details are given in Memo-randum I. Not all these criticisms are well founded; some of them have been met in part by changes of methods since the early days of the war. Collectively, they support the thesis that organisation ofproduction for national purposes in war requires something different from the method by which the Departments obtain their supplies inpeace, that is to say, from the method of placing of contractscentrally with a limited number of main contractors. The increased demands of war compel these contractors to farm out to sub-con-tractors a great deal of the work which they undertake. But thelarge firm in war is not a good channel of communication withthe small firms with which it has competed in the past and expects to compete again. The two parties start on a basis of antagonism.The large firm tries in the first instance to aggrandise itself, hoard-ing labour and materials, placing sub-contracts discontinuously to suit its convenience and in ignorance of what other contractors or government Departments may be doing. Organisation of produc-tion in war should mean harnessing the whole of the industrial capacity of the country, in small firms and large, converting it froma peace basis to a war basis. This involves a regional organisationof the production departments much stronger and more responsiblethan anything that they have yet developed. Failure of these departments to set up such an organisation is one of the majorweaknesses in our economic planning; it is not easy to understand,in view of the known possibility that enemy action would seriouslydisturb our inland communications.8. Failure to co-ordinate different factors of production.Valuable materials stand unused because the firms possessing them have not the skilled labour or the machines. Skilled labour standsunused because the firm has not the materials. Machinery is idlebecause a factory cannot be completed. To some extent such failuresof co-ordination are inevitable in war. They have not yet beenreduced to the irreducible minimum. The reports of our local investi-gators contain instances of valuable machinery or skilled men stand-ing idle for weeks through some trifling hitch in one case delay in sending a few tons of steel to complete a factory extension whicheffective local organisation should have been able to overcome at once.9. Particularism of the units of production.All difficulties due to lack of co-ordination in supply of the differentfactors of production (men, machines, materials) are intensified bythe organisation of production in so many independent firms. War-time economy becomes like the game of &quot; happy-families,&quot; in which one player has two of the four cards required to make a family,while another player has the other two; each player clings to his twouseless cards in the hope of collecting the cards that will make them
223useful. So, for any given piece of vital war production, one firmmay have the materials; another the machines and some of the skilled men; while a third has the rest of the skilled men required.Each clings to what it has in hopes of getting work and nothing is produced. In so far as production of armaments is more com-plicated than &quot; happy-families &quot; and the factors of production are more than four in number, the opportunities of delay through par-ticularism in a time of scarcity are greater than is suggested here.The particularism* of firms is perhaps one reason leading supply departments to place contracts, so far as possible, with large firms.But for reasons already indicated, all war production cannot be con-centrated on large firms without risk of serious loss.io. How far short the nation was in June, 1940, of harnessing itswhole industrial capacity to the purposes of war, under the methodsadopted till then for organising war production, is shown by thefigures extracted from the Survey of Employment which are sum-marised in the Note on Unused Capacity in Memorandum A. Ineach of two important Divisions of the country, about half thenumber of firms covered by the return were available to undertakefurther Government work. This does not mean, of course, that all of them were capable of undertaking such work. As with the registered unemployed, some of these under-employed firms wouldlack the particular qualifications required; their unused capacity is acase of misfit idleness. It may be said that this was probably true of most of them, but such an assertion can hardly be accepted withoutinvestigation; it is not likely that so large a proportion of the engi-engineering firms of the country are incapable of munitions work. Inany case it is clear that up to June last the economic system of thecountry was working with a margin of unused productive capacity in engineering, as it was working with a margin of unemployment.It will be a matter of great interest to see how the figures on thispoint will have changed in the similar survey of employment whichhas just been made for the month of September.11. All these criticisms are illustrations of a single theme. Organi-sation of war production by a nation which faces all the implications of war should be approached as a problem of converting the wholeof the industrial capacity of the country factories, machinery andlabour to serve the aims of war. It requires something different from the process by which defence departments obtain their supplies in peace, either in their own factories or by placing contracts. it requires synoptic vision and unity of economic control. It requiresalso a break with the practice by which those who organise produc-tion in peace normally do so without considering where those whom they propose to employ will live and shop and get their recreation,*&quot; Particularism&quot; is defined in the New English Dictionary generally as:&quot;Exclusive attachment or devotion to one&apos;s particular party, sect, nation, etc. :exclusiveness,&quot; and in relation to politics as: &quot;The principle of leaving each state in an empire or federation free ... to promote its own interests,without reference to most of the whole.&quot; The term thus covers all the slightlydifferent conceptions of pursuit of one&apos;s own interest, lack of co-operation, and limitation of view. The best, but inferior, alternative terms for the present purpose would be &quot;individualism &quot; or &quot; mutual exclusiveness.&quot;
and how they will travel to and from their work. If it is assumed thata threatened war will tax to the utmost the energies of the wholepeople, so that any failure to use capacity or man-power is a dan-dangerous weakness, then organisation of war production must be on a planned basis, with a comprehensive plan covering all the varieties ofproduction required and taking account of every element in the pro-blem, of labour as well as machinery and materials. Planning for thepresent war has not been on that basis. It has been departmentalor sectional, rather than comprehensive: neither the Ministry ofSupply nor any other agency of Government had a generalmandate. It has been limited by lack of power and by instructionsto avoid interference with normal trade; some of the firms which nowseek Government contracts in vain, refused them before, so as tocontinue more profitable private business.The problem now is not of making or executing the best plan but of making the best of an existing situation. Even on that basis, thereis room for improvement, by proceeding, so far as is now practicable in each case, on each of the following lines:  (A) Better distribution of work between areas in relation tojthe existing supply of equipment and the potential resources oflabour.i (B) De-centralisation of the placing of orders for production,!j so as to utilise local knowledge and the capacity of firms of all]&apos; I       sizes and kinds in many areas.(C) Re-consideration of the tender and contract system with a Iview to replacing it by capacity organisation.(D) Association of firms so as to use their productive capacity Iwithout the obstruction of particularism.(E) Closer co-operation of the different Supply Departmentsamong themselves and with the Ministry of Labour.(F) Organisation of special means for treating bottle-necks,te.g., mobile squads of particularly scarce types of labour orcentralised reserves of particularly scarce materials. IORGANISATION OF LABOUR.12. The organisation of labour has many aspects, dealt with at length in Memoranda annexed to this Report. Here five points areselected for emphasis, namely (i) the small extent to which&apos; dilutionof skilled labour with less skilled workpeople, and particularly withwomen, has proceeded; (2) the acute shortage of men possessingcertain types of skill which it is difficult or impossible to acquirerapidly; (3) the difficulties of transferring workpeople from one place to another, and of keeping them in the place to which theyhave been transferred; (4) the need for a considered, consistentpolicy in regard to wages, and (5) arising out of this, the need fora new definition of the terms of civilian employment in war.13. Small extent of Dilution and Recruiting of Women.The slow rate at which dilution of skilled labour is proceeding andhas proceeded is mentioned by most of the local investigators. Re-laxation of trade union restrictions to admit new types of male labour
22ito engineering and allied industries has been authorised by a seriesof agreements between associations of employers and employeesbeginning in August, 1939; under these agreements each individual,case of relaxation has to be registered. The number of registrations M.P to date is very small, having regard to the scale of the industries]concerned. The great bulk of the 170,000 male wage earners addedto the engineering, motor vehicle and aircraft industries between thebeginning of the war and June, 1940, were engaged without registra-tion of relaxations, that is to say, for work customarily performed by men of their qualifications; no doubt in many cases processes havebeen altered and work divided, so as to increase the proportion of thewhole that could be performed by men without special skill. In thecase of women, no agreement for relaxation of trade union restric-tions was made until 22nd May, 1940, and the total number ofwomen recruited by the engineering, motor vehicle and aircraft industries up to June, 1940, was just over 41,000. This is two-thirds of the number of women added in the same time to the register ofunemployment and about one-fifteenth of the number who have joined the Women&apos;s Voluntary Services. To-day the principle ofrelaxation of trade union rules for the period of the war, subjectto registration of relaxations, has been accepted. The procedure is sometimes criticised as cumbersome and sometimes proposalsfor relaxation encounter local opposition. In the main, if dilu-tion still proceeds slowly, this must be attributed not to tradeunion opposition, but to other causes. In Memorandum M on theSubstitute Employment of Women, the view is expressed thati obstacles to dilution arise as much from the reluctance of employers: as from resistance of the men. A great deal has still to be done to convince employers generally that the precise types of labour whichthey have been accustomed to use in peace are not likely to beavailable in war, that war is an affair of substitutes and second bests.As this comes to be realised, the process of diluting skilled labour with women, as with less skilled men, will be hastened. But thereare two causes which are likely to delay for some time to come the recruiting of women for armament work on the scale of the last war.First, the type of armament work on which women are most easilyemployed, namely the making and filling of ammunition, bulks atpresent less largely than it did in the last war in the total productionof armaments. Second, dilution and the use of semi-skilled or un-skilled labour depend to some extent upon solution of the priorproblem of finding the highly skilled labour required to set machines and make tools.14. Acute Shortage of Certain Types of Skill.The general characteristic of the labour market in war is thatthe labour required is largely of one kind (with special skill, mainly in engineering) while that offering itself is largely of another kind(without that skill). Within this general shortage of skilled engineersthere is a special shortage of a limited number of highly skilledtypes: tool room workers and setters of machines. No closestatistical estimate of the degree of this shortage can be made atthis moment, but it is certain that these two classes of men represent
the most important bottle-neck through which the munitions pro-gramme must force its way. A sufficient number of such men tomeet the requirements on established methods of production do not exist; a sufficient number of tool room workers on that basis cannotbe trained within the limits of time available, while the problem ofmaking enough setters is only slightly less intractable. This doesnot mean that this or any other problem of war is insoluble. Itdoes mean, first, that methods of organising production must be adjusted to the fact of these particular shortages. Every unnecessarydiscontinuity of contracts or production and any avoidable changeof design wastes tools and jigs and the skill of those who make them;economy here depends on the service and supply departments. Othereconomies depend on the managers of factories; their thoughtsmust be directed to devising methods of production which willeconomise skill of every type. It means, second, that some ofthe new factories cannot be started, unless a sufficient number of key men of these types are transferred to them from other factories which are already on Government work. It means, third, that^training is almost the most important task in the organisation ofman-power for war; it is dealt with at length in Memorandum C.The largest and most critical part of training must be given by employers in their factories, but they need the help and the stimulusof the Government. Training must cover on a consistent plan andwith immense drive the Government Training Centres, the factories and the technical institutes. It must be training for definiteobjectives and in the right proportion of each type of skill as determined by careful estimate of requirements. It is easier toproduce fitters in large quantities than to produce the much smallerquantities of men of the types most urgently required, but it is idleto produce fitters who cannot be put to work till there are enoughtool-makers or setters of machines.15. Difficulties of Labour Transfer.Nearly all the local investigators in one way or another emphasise the natural immobility of British labour. As late as August, 1940,nearly half the men who had been unemployed for a monthexpressed themselves as unwilling to accept transfer to other dis-tricts and in nine cases out of ten those who refused were heldby interviewing panels to have good reason for their attitude. the mobility of women, particularly married women, is materially lessthan that of men. The tendency of men and women alike, iftransfer has meant leaving their homes, to return home at thefirst opportunity and undo the Employment Exchanged work of transfer is sufficiently common to call for remedy. The practicalinferences to be drawn are: (a) the need by wise distributionboth of new factories and of munition contracts for reducing to aminimum the transfers required, (b) the importance of not adding to the unavoidable difficulties of transfer any difficulties that couldbe avoided and (c) the importance of providing antidotes for home-sickness. Among the avoidable difficulties of transfer mentioned by the investigators and discussed in Memorandum J are wage
differentials, excessive or unequal travelling costs, lodging allow-ances which are felt to be too small in view of the charges made forlodging, inadequate arrangements for housing or transport, and,in some districts, over-generous treatment of unemployed personswho refuse unreasonably to transfer; where the transfer is witha view not to immediate employment but to training, there arecomplaints of inadequacy of the training allowance. Preventionof home-sickness means taking thought not only as to conditionsin the factory, but as to lodging and the time outside the factory;men and women cut off for months from their familiar domesticsurroundings need some alternative social life. More important than any of these practical problems is the psychological problemof securing that necessary civilian employment in war is regarded by all citizens as a duty not to be refused or abandoned lightly,to please oneself or one&apos;s family. War is no respecter of family life;all citizens, not fighting men only, must be prepared for its suspension-sion while the war lasts.16. Need for a Wage Policy.The need for a considered consistent wage policy is critical and urgent. As is pointed out in Memorandum B, a wage systemestablished in peace has no relevance to the changed conditions and values of war. The State cannot effectively require citizensto accept work and stay at work as directed in the national interest,without taking responsibility for the terms of their remunerationin the work to which they are assigned. To leave this matter eitherto collective or individual bargaining leads to exploitation andexcessive earnings in some cases and injustice and insufficientincome in other cases; it fosters both harmful immobility and waste-ful movement. Extreme inequality of earnings for similar tasksis inconsistent with the effective distribution of man-power. Butextreme inequality with its resultant waste of man-power and illfeeling cannot be prevented in war except by the action of theState. &quot; I would like to draw attention to the difficulty which con-fronts us and will confront us as long as the wages vary in thedifferent factories in this locality from approximately  5 to  16per week.&quot; This observation comes from the Chief Labour SupplyOfficer in one of the largest armament centres of the country, whereat this moment production is being reduced by needless persistentchange of jobs. Remedy is required and can be applied only by the State; control of employment in the national interest pre-supposes control of the wages paid in employment. This does not mean that, in regard to wages and conditions, the State or any government Department on behalf of the State should act other-wise than after consultation with the established organisations ofemployers and employees. It does mean that the ultimate respon-sibility for deciding what standard of life is possible under war conditions for varying types of workmen cannot be escaped by theState and that any attempt to escape this must lead to confusion and waste. This was the experience of the last war and the experi-ence is in process of being repeated in this war. A policy in regardto wages implies also a policy in regard to incomes other than wages.
17. Terms of Civilian Employment.The question of wages is part of the wider question of the terms of civilian employment in war. There is no cause or need to assimilatethe terms of civilian employment to those of military service. Threevital distinctions are suggested in the discussion of this issue in Memo-randum B; they are the avoidance of criminal sanctions for factorydiscipline, administration of controls by an authority other than the employer, and a right of appeal. Subject to these distinctions, thewhole man-power of the nation cannot be harnessed to the purpose ofwar, except on the understanding that it is the duty of every citizento undertake whatever work may be assigned to him upon whateverterms the Government deems to be just after reasonable considera-tion of all the circumstances. The motive of service much be suh-stituted for the motive of personal gain in industrial employment for national purposes, as fully as in the fighting forces or in the servicesof civil defence. This is the intention of the Emergency Powers(Defence) Act. It remains to make that Act effective. The nexus ofcitizen and State in war is not cash but patriotism. I18. This conclusion applies to all total war. It applies with specialforce in the circumstances of the present war, when in a small island,subject to aerial attack and threatened by invasion, the fighting menand the members of the civil defence services stand under disciplinecheek by jowl with the industrial army. Success in this war depends upon all three indispensable partners in the war remaining continu-ously at work under conditions of risk. There is reason for hoping that the actual damage to our factories and industrial equipment bysuccessful bombing can be kept within limits not seriously affectingtotal output. The main problem one of the most critical issues of thewar is that of maintaining continuity of work and output by night,as well as by day, in factories which are threatened but not hit.There are three sides to this problem. The first is that of giving tothe men themselves when at work the best possible protection andwarning of imminent danger; this is a matter of organising a warning system on the basis of men in vital work being treated like men in theFighting Forces. The second side is that of making suitable provisionfor the workmen&apos;s families and homes; this is considered below withspecial reference to London (paragraphs 29-33). The third side ofthe problem concerns the workman&apos;s view of his relation to his work.The safety of the country requires that workpeople engaged on vitalwar production should act as if they were in the front line, shouldtake its necessary risks, should not retreat from their line except under orders to avoid excessive risks. They will be more ready toact in this way if they regard themselves as servants of the Statethan as employees at a bargained wage. The industrial workers ofthis country are of the same metal as those enrolled in the fighting forces and in civilian defence; they would be as ready under trustedleaders for service and sacrifice; there is no need to lure them to national tasks by hope of personal gain. Looking back, it seems clear that we should have done best by placing a large proportionof our armament production upon a National Service basis fromthe beginning: with the works taken over for the period of the warand the remuneration of the shareholders fixed; with the managerial
staff on salaries; with wages standardised, and all inequalities due totravelling and lodging costs evened out and all the special risks fully and fairly covered by compensation or insurance. What it wouldbe possible or advisable to do to-day, after so long a start on wronglines, is not so clear. But the question of wages cannot be left as itis, without needless friction in the use of man-power, without riskof growing inequalities and recurring discontent. The framing of adefinite wage and income policy, after consultation with the respon-sible organisations of employers and employed and in the light of allthe facts, should no longer be neglected. The lines on which this problem might be approached, are suggested at the end of Memo-randum B.MACHINERY   OF   ADMINISTRATION.19. The administrative conditions for bringing about with themaximum possible speed the necessary labour readjustments are,first, effective unity of control over labour questions, and, second,decentralisation of executive responsibility. Effective unity of controlof labour means control through the Ministry of Labour and national Service. There is a single pool of labour; there are manysupply departments with limited responsibilities. Nothing must bedone by the officers of any supply department to weaken theauthority of the officers of the Ministry or to encourage employers in resisting inspection, dilution, acceptance of trainees, and so forth.No instructions of any kind affecting the use of labour should begiven to employers otherwise than through or in agreement withofficers of the Ministry.20. Though the Ministry of Labour should be the sole officialorgan of the Government for dealing with labour questions, this does not mean that supply departments have no legitimate interestin such questions and no right to be continuously consulted. Theorganisation of production and the organisation of labour areinseparable. As compared with the war of 1914-18, the machineryof Government to-day is stronger, in including the long establishedcomprehensive organisation of the Ministry of Labour and the Em-ployment Exchanges; the last war began with no separate Ministryof Labour and a weaker system of Exchanges. As some compen-sation, there was greater administrative unity, since munitions labour questions were dealt with in the Ministry of Munitions itself; therewere also fewer separate supply departments. To combine the advan-tages of the last war with the advantages of this war, the completestpossible co-operation of that Ministry and of the supply departments at all stages from the top to the bottom is essential. The labourquestion is one. Equally, it cannot be divided from control ofproduction.21. Administrative co-operation must extend to the regions as wellas to the centre. Labour readjustment is a hand-made job, to beundertaken factory by factory according to the circumstances of themoment. It must be carried out by local officers personally and not by orders from Whitehall. Steps have recently been taken tostrengthen the regional and local organisation of some of the supply
departments to match the regional and local organisation of theMinistry of Labour. Whether or not these have gone far enough,and whether sufficient responsibility has been devolved may well be doubted.22. To its established machinery of Employment Exchanges, theMinistry of Labour, within the past three months, has added an extensive organisation of Labour Supply Committees, Inspectors ofLabour Supply, building inspectors, and so forth. It has by theIndustrial Registration Order of August, 1940, put itself into a positionto know exactly what numbers of workmen possessing various types of scarce skill are available. The problem of labour readjustment,however, is not one simply of economising those types of labour which are scarce, but of making full use of other types of man-power which are abundant and available for conversion to war purposes.This process of conversion is something quite different from ordinaryEmployment Exchange work. The function of an employment exchange in peace is to submit for any vacancy, if possible, a personwell qualified to fill it. It is not concerned with bringing about achange of occupations. The criticisms of the Ministry of Labourmachinery, reported by the local investigators, relate predominantlyto this new field, of conversion from one type of work to another.In the field for which it was constructed the machine has stood the strain of war remarkably.23. Conversion from one occupation to another is a new taskcalling for a development of existing machinery under several heads.First, many professional and managerial workers and many unoccu-pied persons not normally dealt with by Employment Exchanges areavailable either for employment or for service. The ExchangeService needs to be strengthened by appointment of officers whoseprimary task should be the conversion of professional and unoccupiedpersons to working for the national needs. This task calls for special qualifications and experience and time to consider each individual case. Second, workpeople highly skilled in unessential trades be-come available for transfer to munition work. In printing, wood-working, boot and shoe making, hosiery, there are men and womenused to machines of one kind, available to learn machines of anotherkind. This conversion is important in view both of the restriction of civilian consumption and of evacuation and war damage. Tt shouldbe the function of the Ministry of Labour to take thought as to howall men and women displaced from their previous occupations canbe converted as speedily as possible to the occupations needed by war. Economic mobilisation in war is not in the main a problemof placing contracts or building new factories, but of using capacity.For this purpose also special officers are needed. Third, conversionof labour to new occupations requires in some cases a substantialperiod of training. As is stated above, training for munitions work is one of the most critical tasks before the Ministry of Labour; it forms the subject of one of the principal memoranda annexed to thisReport. Training, however, may be needed, not only for muni-tions work, but for other occupations among which agriculture isimportant.
227TO24. The primary objective in organising man-power is to secure thelargest possible output of things vitally needed in war armaments,ships, food and shelter. A second objective distinct, though less important is to preserve civilian morale by preventing idleness.To find employment for all the energies of the people is worth doingfor its own sake. This is not now being accomplished and thedifficulties of accomplishing it, as indicated in Memorandum A, mustnot be under-rated. It is not likely to be accomplished completely,except by development of direct State action in setting citizens towork and serve. There is at least one field which offers opportunityboth of securing the performance of work which next year may proveof vital importance to the country, in increasing the production offood, and of using energies at present unused. This is the field ofland reclamation and land improvement dealt with in MemorandumP. The scope for some types of such work is limited in war by factorsother than man-power, such as the supply of fertilisers. But forother types, in particular drainage and ditch cleaning, the scopeis not so limited and such work should be undertaken. TheGeneral reserves of man-power which exist now in the form&apos; ofunemployment and idleness among British citizens will be diminishedas the war proceeds; they may even vanish completely. But inaddition to the general body of persons unemployed or unoccupied,they are special reserves of man-power among friendly aliens and among conscientious objectors to military service which it is unwiseand inhumane to neglect.25. The most generally available form of unused or ill-used general   -gies is not here but among young people between the ages of 16-20.They are mobile and adaptable in the highest degree, but to makethe best use of them requires organisation by the State. Young menbefore they are wanted for the Fighting Forces would be betterengaged in a Youth Labour Service undertaking to do whatevercivilian work is required of them on the land or in industry, in Iforestry, in salvage or defence, in training for munitions or for agriculture, than in filling for a short time the places of men called to the Colours, which might in many cases have been filled by olderwomen. A memorandum outlining a scheme for a Youth labour service is annexed to this Report. To some this may appear to be ,too much like taking a leaT out of the book of the enemy, yet 1sometimes it is necessary to learn from him for the purpose of thewar. In reality the proposals made in Memorandum Q resemblemore closely President Roosevelt&apos;s Civilian Conservation Corpsthan they resemble any kind of Fascist or Nazi youth organisation.To relate the youth of the country directly to the service of the state is important both for what they can do and for the effect upon their minds.26. While the number of women seeking employment still exceeds the demand in most industries, there is one field for women&apos;s activitywhere demand exceeds supply. This is the field of the women&apos;services, as to which some particulars are given in Memorandum R.Of the three women&apos;s services attached to the fighting forces, two-27223 a 6
the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service and the Women&apos;s Auxiliary AirForce Service have usually been able to obtain, though not alwaysin overflowing numbers and not always with the required technical qualifications, the recruits they require. The much larger AuxiliaryTerritorial Service, attached to the Army, has experienced at timesboth difficulty in getting its full numbers and considerable wastagefrom its ranks. This is certainly not due to unwillingness of women to render service where their financial circumstances permit, as isshown by the phenomenal growth of the Women&apos;s Voluntary Ser-vices. It is possible that women dependent on their earnings andaccustomed to contribute from these to a joint family income find the absence of any system of dependents&apos; allowances a hindrance.But, with the present limited demand for women&apos;s work in other fields, it is difficult to believe that the 10,000 or so additional recruitsrequired would not be forthcoming on the existing terms. At mosta revision of recruiting and welfare arrangements may be requiredto deal with the present situation. It is necessary, however, to look forward to a changed situation, when the demand for women in munitions work becomes immense and urgent, when, at the sametime, the demand for men to fight increases and makes it imperativeto maintain or to increase the proportion of women in the defence services. Recruiting of women for these services is voluntary andmust presumably remain voluntary; compulsion for the small num-bers required would be so selective that it could hardly be made to appear just. But without compulsion will enough women be obtained for the defence services or retained in them, if the managers of muni-tion factories are left free to offer for women at public expense what-ever terms they think fit or are driven to concede in bargaining? Theterms for women in the services must be governed by the terms formen there. The issue of bringing into fair relation the terms of defenceservice and of civilian employment may thus be raised in regard to women even more acutely than it is now raised in regard to men. a nation which persists in trying to burke this issue may find itself usingconscript men for want of women volunteers to do work in thedefence services which women can do and are doing now.27. Looking back it seems clear that full preparation of the war would have included the development of the Ministry of Labour intothe Ministry of Labour and National Service in the full sense of thelast three words. That is to say, the Government would have estab-lished an organ for utilising energies a&quot;hd offers of service of every kind in every locality for every conceivable purpose; sooner or later all capable citizens not absorbed by domestic duties wouldhave found themselves absorbed in some activitiy designed forwar purposes. As regards one class, that of women who can afford to give help without remuneration of any kind, this work of organising energies has been admirably performed by the Women&apos;sVoluntary Services, but this covers only part of the total field andwisely limits its scope. To set up a comprehensive organisation atthis stage might be inappropriate and lead to overlapping. Butthrough the Ministry of Labour and National Service, or through some other organ, the Government should still be prepared to actwhenever occasion arises.
28. While some unemployment in war is inevitable a necessaryeVil the making of unnecessary unemployment is indefensible. Theapplication of Limitation of Supplies Orders, designed to bring aboutthe contraction of unessential industries should be governed by this consideration: the practical implications of this general principle inregard to particular industries are discussed in Memoranda G and E.In so far as limitation of supplies by restriction orders is necessaryto conserve materials which are urgently needed elsewhere or whoseimportation throws burdens on our shipping or foreign exchange,the orders can be justified, in spite of the loss that they cause. As a means of making labour available for national work by first throwingit into unemployment, they cannot be justified unless no better plan is open. There is no difficulty in suggesting a better plan, throughuse of the compulsory powers now given to the Minister of Labour.The limited classes of men of whom there is a shortage can be dis-covered by requiring their registration, as has been done for engineersby the Industrial Registration Order; they can then be transferred,voluntarily or compulsorily, when jobs are ready for them. A sub-stantial part of the demand for munitions labour is still in the future.The munition factories should be filled as the fighting forces arerecruited: by registering in advance men and women of the classeswhom they will ultimately require, by exempting those who arealready engaged on work of national importance, by leaving the others in their present work till they are needed and calling them up as the munition factories get ready to receive them.LONDON LIFE AND LABOUR UNDER AIR-RAIDS.29. The London Division of the Ministry of Labour contained inJune, 1940, 419,000 wage-earners engaged on Government work inthe chief armament industries other than shipbuilding (that is to say we engineering, motor vehicle and aircraft construction, chemicals and explosives, electric cables and apparatus, scientific instruments and a few others); this was just under one-fifth of the total of2,i6o;ooo in Great Britain. The London Division in August, 1940,contained 84,000 skilled engineers not wholly on Government work;this was rather more than one-fifth of the total number in GreatBritain, enrolled under the Industrial Registration Order. Manyessential services and important reserves of man-power other thanthose named above are in the same area. What action in regardto them is suggested by consideration of the latest developments of aerial warfare ?30. It seems probable that against precision bombing in daylightLondon is as defensible as any other part of the country. I under-stand that this view has recently been expressed with authority, andthe corollary has been suggested that there is no reason why arma-raents work should not continue to be located in London, even in greater proportions than at present. Before such a corollary is drawn, however, regard must be had to the fact that workmen havehomes and families as well as places of work. Security againstprecision bombing by daylight is consistent with the prospect that theworkmen&apos;s homes will be made physically or psychologically unin-habitable by air attack in the hours of darkness. At present, the27223 A 7
German planes are over London for nine or ten hours every night;as winter approaches, they may be there sixteen hours. We may hope to improve the defence against night raids as against day raids,but we must be prepared for the possibility that raids sufficient tomake home life impossible at night in London will continue without serious interruption almost indefinitely. What course of action is indicated, if we fairly face this possibility?31. The first practical inference is that we cannot look to london as a source of labour supply to any other district unless we-move,not only the skilled workman, but his family; that is to say, if we wish to draw on the reserves of skilled labour in London to feed new factories in the Midlands or the North-West, we must either transferonly single men, giving them the preference of escaping from London,or we must arrange to move married men and their families as well.The second inference is that we cannot expect men to stay at theirworkplaces in London either by clay or by night unless their familieshave reasonable security. This means either (a) that adequate shelterswith sleeping and night feeding facilities are provided not only for themen but for their families, or (b) that shelter facilities are providedfor the men in London and their families are removed to conditionsof reasonable comfort and safety outside London. The third infer-ence is that we cannot regard the family as the organisation for feedingand attending to the other human needs of those at work. This isobvious on alternative (b) above, of removal of families. Practicallyit is as true on the alternative (a). The difficulty of cooking in london is already serious in man3&apos; areas through cutting off of heating. Thelengthening hours of raiding in the winter months will prevent cookingaltogether for a large part of each 24 hours. Any home on which aparticular workman depends for his feeding and shelter may be destroyed in a moment.32. From these three separate inferences there emerges the prac-tical conclusion that the Staie must be prepared do undertake com-munal cooking and feeding for all that part of the London populationthat is not removed from London, as it must undertake to provide that all who stay in London have registered and reserved sleepingaccommodation in a shelter which is felt to be safe. On no otherterms can the continuance of work be demanded or expected. unless and until invasion happens London is the front line, with East andSouth London as forward trenches. This should now be recognisednot in words only, but in deeds. The Government must fairly andsquarely undertake the responsibility of seeing that life is made possible for those whose continued presence in the front line isrequired for the safety of the country. The front line is not a litenvironment for family life.33. At the moment London is the favourite target of the enemvfor indiscriminate night bombing. But it is not the only target. Whatis suggested above for London may be needed in time for other indus-trial centres. The Government should prepare everywhere to providecompletely for those who have to stay in vital industrial centres and to disperse all unnecessary people away from these centres tosafety.
34. Passage from peace to war involves a change of industrial structure and occupations too violent to allow the man-power of thecountry to be put at once and continuously to its new uses. Theactual use of available man-power in Britain to-day is less completethan it need be, mainly because the peace-time economic and politicalstructure of the country has been carried on with too little change into war. There has been too much reliance on individual capitalismwith its accompanying machinery of wage bargaining, even thoughthe excess profits tax and other financial relations between the Stateand managers of businesses have deprived both private capitalismand wage bargaining of their logical basis. There has been needlessreliance upon the motive of personal gain as the sole basis upon whichworkmen can be expected to render service to the State. There hasbeen too little readiness of the State to take responsibilities and decisions in the economic sphere and to respond to the desire of citizens to be told what their duty is and to do it on whatever termstheir trusted leaders in the Government declare to be just. TheEmergency Powers ^Defence) Act of May, 1940, represents thesettled wishes of the people but not yet the practice of the Govern-ment.35. In spite of this, the achievement of the nation in preparing forwar, while waging war, is remarkable. The difficulty of suggestinglarge changes of policy or of endeavouring to plan ahead in a timeof instant crisis is manifest. It may well be asked whether, even ifdifferent methods of organising our economic effort from the begin-ning would have yielded better results, it is worth while to-day tomake any considerable change. This is the question which Memo-randum D, by Mr. G. D. H. Cole, on the Structure of Industry inPeace and War, is designed to answer.36. In the standing debate between price mechanism and Stateplanning as the best methods of organising and guiding productionin time of peace, there are strong arguments on each side. In this debate the science of economics gives no clear lead; decision is amatter of judgment; decision depends on psychological and politicalvaluations by which different reasonable men may well be led to different conclusions. In war the conditions of the problem arechanged; the price mechanism does not function; State planningbecomes inevitable and proves effective in proportion to its com-pleteness. Private enterprise for private profit at personal risk is agood ship and a ship that has brought us far on the voyage of risingstandards of life. But it is a ship for fair weather and open seas. Totake the shocks of war, we need a vessel of another build, more sturdyif less swift, a Fram not a China clipper. We need State planningon national account. We have private enterprise largely at publicrisk, a mixture of two designs missing the virtues of each design.Even at this late hour, it would be worth while to make large changesin the economic basis of our armament industries, in order to breakdown completely the wasteful particularism of the units of production,to pool labour and all resources, to make all men consciously servants97223 A 8
of the State, working for the community and not for personal gain.A steady move in that direction is the economic measure which, morethan anything else, would most help to ensure success in war. It is ameasure which could and should be taken without prejudice to thefuture.   War is not peace and peace is not war.37. The ultimate problem of man-power is psychological. In one way or another, we need to make general among industrial workers and their managers and foremen the spirit which animates those who,night after night, contend with fire and wreck in London, regardless of pay and danger. Is there any change of economic or politicalsj^stems, any sacrifice during war of old ways of thinking that we ought not to be prepared to make for such a purpose ? The art ofleadership is making common men do uncommon things.II.   PRINCIPAL MEMORANDAA. Unemployment, Idleness, and Unused Capacity in War.   (W.H.B.)War-time types of unemployment.The occurrence of unemployment and other forms of unwilling idleness inwar is not as surprising as many people suppose. This can be seen, by con-sidering how and why unemployment occurs in peace. Broadly speaking, inpeace-time there are three main causes of unemployment. First, unemploymentmay occur through general difficulty of making profits, as in cyclical depressionsof trade. A second cause of unemployment lies in the changing fortunes of individual employers, leading to interval unemployment while men are passingfrom one employer to another or waiting for the next job to come along intheir own trade and place; a special type of this interval unemployment is therecurrent idleness of men in casual occupations, working one day and standing in Teserve the next day. Yet a third type of unemployment may be described as misfit unemployment; the labour offering is of the wrong type or in the wrong place to meet the demand.The first type of unemployment does not exist in war. There is an immenseinsatiable demand by the State for goods and services, backed by adequatepurchasing power, regardless of costs and profits. Nothing less catastrophicthan a war or Communism appears to be sufficient to arrest the course of cyclicalfluctuation, which rolls over New Deals like a Juggernaut, but there is nodoubt that modern wars are capable of making this arrest.The second type of unemployment, described as interval unemployment, tends to diminish in war, as employers come to work more and more to meet urgentnational demands. But some irregularities in the flow of work cannot be avoided even under war conditions.The third type of peace-time unemployment, described as misfit unemploy-ment, tends to increase. Change from peace to war brings &apos;a change in the kinds of goods and services demanded and calls for a corresponding change ofindustrial structure and occupations. This change, on the one hand, sets upa demand in excess of the available supply for workmen possessing certain kinds of skill, and, on the other hand, diminishes the demand for other classes olworkmen, skilled or unskilled, and causes unemployment among them, unless and until they can be trained to meet the new demand. The changes of indus-trial structure required by war may have further consequence of developing the new demands for labour in particular places, while the available supply oflabour is in other places. Misfit unemployment is thus of two main kinds, arisingfrom misfits of quality and of place respectively. In a country liableto invasion from the air or otherwise local unemployment may assume largeproportions.
There is yet a fourth kind of unemployment, special to war, due to the factthat the demand for labour is always a joint demand; is a demand, not for labour alone but for labour of a particular kind, to work with particular equip-ment on given materials. If the materials and the equipment are not there,the labour, though it may be available, cannot be employed. Peace-timeeconomy works with a reserve of equipment and materials, as it works with areserve of man-power. If the reserves of any particular equipment or materialsbecome exhausted, indeed long before they reach exhaustion, an effective stimulusis given to make up the deficiency. Only rarely does unemployment of labouroccur in peace-time through lack of materials or equipment. In war the posi-tion is changed. The demand for particular materials or equipment is increased;simultaneously many of the normal sources of supply get cut off by enemy action; the deficiencies cannot be made good rapidly and sometimes can hardly be made good at all. There arises, as an important element of war economics,a type of unemployment hardly known in peace, which may be described as&quot; bottle-neck &quot; unemployment. For any particular class of workmen bottle-neck unemployment may occur through lack, not of equipment or materials,but of some other class of workmen without whom they cannot be set to work.It is easy from this brief review to see how and why unemployment occursin war, in spite of an immense unsatisfied demand by a purchaser not looking for profits and able to make every demand effective. And in addition to unemployment such as gets registered in peace-time at the EmploymentExchanges, large resources of man-power of all kinds become available in war,through desire of citizens to give up their peace-time occupation or retirementor education and undertake national service in one form or another. But the mere fact that these citizens offer their labour does not create a demand fortheir labour. They offer one thing; the potential employers are apt to demandanother. They may offer it one place while the demand is in another. their offer may be subject to conditions which, however reasonable in themselves,make their services practically unavailable.It is easy to explain unemployment and unwilling idleness in war. It isdifficult to cure it. Cyclical unemployment disappears and interval unemploy-ment can without difficulty be reduced. But it is impossible to get rid of allirregularities in the flow of work at particular places of employment, and bothmisfit unemployment,, arising from misfits either of quality and of place, andbottle-neck unemployment increase. Misfit and bottle-neck unemployment inwar can be prevented only by careful planning and execution on the economicside of war and by removing all frictions which impede the occupational andlocal mobility of labour.Unemployment Statistics by Divisions and Sexes.This brief summary of the ways in which unemployment and other forms ofunwilling idleness may arise in war can be illustrated by examination of the statistics of unemployment.The &apos;&apos; unemployment percentage,&apos;&apos; derived by comparing the count of insuredunemployed each month with the numbers insured as determined by or inferredfrom the numbers of unemployment books exchanged in July, ceases under war conditions to be a trustworthy figure, whether in application to the wholeinsured population or to any special class of workpeople. This is due to the rapid changes in the numbers of insured persons brought about (a) as regardsmen, by calling up for the fighting services, and (b) as regards all classes, by changes of local and industrial distribution.The effect of the war on registered unemployment is shown in general terms in Table i attached giving (a) by Divisions and (6) by four principal age andsex groups the numbers registered as unemployed in August, 1939, and August,1940, respectively, with the figures for August, 1940, expressed as percentages01 those a year before.The table brings out clearly, in the first place, the influence of place onunemployment.   Taking all groups together the London and Southern Divisionsboth show an increase in the number unemployed during the first year of war,while the Eastern Division shows a relatively small decrease.   All the other27223 A 9
Divisions in Britain show substantial decreases, which are largest in the midlands and in the North Western Division. As a consequence, the three first-namedDivisions (London, Eastern and Southern) which, in August, 1939, contributedr8-g per cent, or less than one-fifth of the total unemployment, in August,1940, contributed 34 - 5 per cent, or more than one-third of the total. .Taking all Divisions together, Table 1 shows an even more marked contrastin the experience of unemployment as between the sexes. Registered unemploy-ment among men has been reduced to less than one-half, and that among boysis little more than three-quarters of what it was a year ago. On the otherhand, unemployment among women has increased by 25-9 per cent, and that among girls by 30 per cent. The decline of unemployment among men is due in part to the calling-up of men to the fighting services. This cannot account for the decline in the number of boys, and the fact that unemployment amongboys has decreased while that among girls and women has increased, suggestsa tendency to replace men called up for service by boys rather than by womenor by girls. Another feature of the table is that decline of unemployment among boys is less than among men, while increase of unemployment amonggirls is greater than among women. This may be due to changes in the agecomposition of the population as the result of the rapid fluctuations of the birth-rate in the years immediately succeeding the last war.Taking separately each group and Division, the differences of experienceare emphasized. While every Division shows a decrease of unemployimentamong men, eight of the eleven British Divisions show an increase of unemploy-ment among women; only in the Midlands, North Western and North EasternDivisions are there fewer unemployed women in August, 1940, than a year before and in one of these the decline is very small. Looking at the column ofpercentages for men, it is seen that in London unemployment has fallen byless than a fifth, to 82-5 per cent, of the 1939 figure, while in the Midlands ithas fallen by five-sixths to 16-4 per cent. The figures of unemployment amongwomen in 1940 show a range from 223-2 per cent, of the 1930 figure in London to64 - 3 per cent, in the Midlands.Another significant point is the change in the number of persons registered as unemployed but not claiming benefit or allowances. These figures are givenin a monthly table showing the composition of unemployment statistics (as atpage 217 of the Labour Gazette for August, 1940, and page 301 of the LabourGazette for August, 1939). Taking only uninsured persons on the Registeraged 16 and over from July, 1939, to July, 1940, the men show a slight increase(from 19,368 to 22,815), boys shows a rather large proportionate increase (from1,005 &quot;to 1,428), girls show a still greater increase (from 2,149 to 3,692), whilewomen show an increase disproportionately greater than that of any othersection (from 15,173 to 71,850). This increase is nearly large enough to account for the total increase- of registered unemployment among women. It representspersons who have not recently been in the insured trades (i.e., have not beengainfully employed or have been working at an uninsured occupation like indoordomestic service) but now seek employment. Persons who apply only for warwork or service are as a rule excluded from this registration.Unemployment by Industries.Unemployment, to be understood, must be analysed by industries as well as bydivisions and age or sex groups. This has been done by comparing for each ofthe 109 industries of the Labour Gazette classifications and for males amifemales separately, the -numbers unemployed in July, 1939, and July, 1940,respective!)&apos;, and showing the percentage changes between those dates. Theseindustrial figures relate to insured persons only, that is to say they exclude the large addition to the women&apos;s register represented by persons not claimingbenefit or assistance. They are confined to persons already in the industrial field. Among males increases of unemployment are shown only by six of the109 industries, namely Slate Quarrying, Tin Plates, Dressmaking, Hats and Caps,Paper and Printing and Bookbinding; nearly all the others show large decreases.Among females the experience is altogether different, more than half theindustries showing an increase of unemployment.   The figures in many industries
are small, as women play little part in them. Leaving out of account 49industries where the unemployed females in July, 1939, were less than 500, ofthe remaining 60 industries, 38 show an increase of unemployment and 22 adecrease; of the 22 industries with reduced unemployment 15 are textile ormetal industries. The 38 industries with substantial numbers of women andmore unemployment in July, 1940, than in July, 1939, are set out in Table 2.4s is stated above, the figures used here are confined to women already in theindustrial field. In view of this, the widespread increase of unemployment shown by Table 2 among females at the end of the first year of war emphasizes theslowness with which industry is being readjusted to&apos; war needs. It shows alsothe small extent to which the calling of men to the fighting forces-the mainfactor in decreasing male unemployment is leading as yet to employment ofwomen as substitutes. Among males and among females alike, the experience ofdifferent industries is widely different. The changes of unemployment in thefirst vear of war range for males from a rise of 144 per cent, in Slate Quarryingto a fall of 85-2 per cent, in Artificial Silk; for females (taking only the 60 in-dustries with substantial numbers), the range is from a rise of 209-5 Per cent, in paper and Paper Board to a fall of 59-8 per cent, in Cotton Manufacture. Itmust be realised, however, that figures of unemployment by themselves showonly one side of the picture. They must be completed by a survey of employ-ment when full details of the exchange of unemployment books in July, 1940,become available.Extent of &quot; unemploy&quot;ability &quot; among the unemployed.The suggestion is sometimes made that a large proportion of those whocontinue in war to register as unemployed must be personally unemployable;otherwise they would be absorbed by war-time needs for labour. This clearlydoes not explain the unemployment among women, now forming a large pro-portion of the total register. ISIor can it apply to men only temporarily stoppedor standing idle in casual occupations or to men who have been at workrecently. With a view to determining the industrial quality of the insuredunemployed, the Ministry of Labour has arranged for men on the Register tobe seen personally by panels of interviewers familiar with industrial conditions.The actual procedure has varied slightly from one industry to another. In coal-mining all men wholly unemployed were interviewed. Of 18,699 such men,6,191 or practically one-third were adjudged to be not suitable for employmentin coal-mining. Among seamen, all those registered were interviewed unless they were known to be on the point of going to sea again shortly. Of 3,991men interviewed, 3,487 or 87 per cent, were adjudged to be suitable for seagoingemployment. In other industries, interviewing has been limited to men who hadbeen unemployed for at least one month and the work of interviewing is notyet complete. The results reported up to the end of July and August, covering86,976 men, show 66,002 as fit for ordinary industrial employment. Theremaining 20,974 or 24 Per cent, of the whole included some who in the viewof the panels were likely to become fit after a period of trial employment orreconditioning.What proportion this 24 per cent, not immediately fit is of the total unemploy-ment among males cannot be determined exactly, since information as to theperiod of unemployment in individual cases is not available for any recent date,except May, 1940. In that month, 46-2 per cent, of all applicants had been registered for less than six weeks, a proportion not very different from the41-6 per cent, recorded a year before in May, 1939; the proportion among menalone would be less. A reasonable assumption from these figures is that themen who had been unemployed for a month at least in July and August, 1940,would be about 66 per cent, of all the men unemployed. On this assumption,men adjudged by the panels to be unsuitable for ordinary industrial employ-ment would be 24 per cent, of 66 per cent., that is to say, 16 per cent, of allunemployed men. Among unemployed seamen the proportion judged unfit to pursue their calling is lower, at 13 per cent. Among coal-miners it is higher,at about 33 per cent., but a proportion of those held to be unfit for coal-miningwould be fit for other forms of employment.   An over-all figure of 20 per cent.
or one in five of all unemployed men, as the proportion disqualified for ordinaryemployment by age infirmity or other personal causes, is a maximum figure;one-sixth is probably nearer the mark. Even some of those judged by thepanels to be unfit for normal industrial employment might prove capable ofrendering useful service in war. It is clear that personal unemployabililyaccounts only for a small proportion of total unemployment of both sexes.One-fifth of all the men unemployed in August, 1940 (excluding agricultureand Northern Ireland), is less than 85,000.   One-sixth is about 70,000.An enquiry of the same type into agricultural unemployment leads to similarresults. Of 1,018 men who had been unemployed for more than one month and whose normal occupation was agriculture, 444 or about 43 per cent, were regarded as not suitable for agricultural employment, in most cases on accountof age or physical or mental disability. This is a larger proportion than in industry of the men unemployed for more than one month, but on the otherhand the proportion of unemployed in agriculture who had been umemployed for more than one month was small. The actual figures were 1,018 men whosenormal occupation was agriculture and 503 for whom agriculture was analternative occupation. This is only 30 per cent, of the total numbers on theagricultural register as unemployed. On these results the proportion ofunemployment in agriculture which can be regarded as due to unemployabilityis only 43 per cent, of 30 per cent., that is to say 13 per cent, of all registeredunemployment.Mobility of Labour.The interviews throw light also on mobility. Of 68,230 men classified for thispurpose, 34,777 or 51-0 per cent, expressed willingness to take work in other districts than their own with lodging or travel allowances. 30,293 or 44-3 percent, expressed unwillingness for reasons judged by the panels to be justified,and 3,160 or 4-7 per cent, were unwilling without good reason. Thesepercentages relate to men; the proportion of women able to accept transfer wouldcertainly be less. Immobility is a far more important cause of war-timeunemployment than personal unfitness.Unused Industrial Capacity.The question of how fully the industrial capacity of the country is being usedfor national purposes, can be approached also from another angle, by use ofreturns obtained by the Ministry of Labour in June, 1940, for its survey ofEmployment in Engineering and allied trades. In this return each firm was asked to state whether or not it had facilities for undertaking (further) Govern-ment work. The answers to this question for two important Divisions (North-Eastern and Midlands) are summarised in the following table :  Firms.	North-Eastern.		Midlands.		Number.	Per cent, of all firms.	Number.	Per cent, of all firms.Able to take further Government work. Able to if labour could be found ... Not able No answer ...	452 67 389 .67	45-6 6-8 39-2 8-4	422 96 380 118	4i-5 9-5 37-4 n-6	991	100-o	1016	100-o
In each case nearly half the firms had capacity available for Government work,but not being used for it.In the North-Eastern Division, the 452 firms able without additional labour to take further Government work, employed 28,407 persons, 63 per firm, ascompared with 107,800 or an average of 109 per firm in the Division as a whole.In the Midlands Divisions the 422 firms able without additional labour totake further Government work employed 46,933 persons; an average of in perfirm as compared with 208,000 or an average of 205 in the Division as a whole.That is to say, in each Division, such firms were smaller on an average thanthe rest, but were not confined to small firms. Their total capacity wassubstantial.These returns show how far short the country was in June, 1940, of harnessingthe whole capacity of its engineering industry to the purposes of war, under themethods adopted till then. They show reserves of capacity among firms, asthe statistics cited above show reserves of man-power. In regard to capacity,as in regard to man-power, the same problem of misfits arises. What proportionof the firms offering to do Government work had, in fact, the qualifications for it, is uncertain.Summary.From this brief review of unemployment and other statistics, the followingfeatures emerge:  (1) War-time unemployment is not to any large extent due tounemployability; the persons unsuited for ordinary industrial employment are   not more than one in five of the men, and a very small proportionindeed of the women, less than 85,000 altogether, out of 729,000 registeredunemployed in Great Britain in August, 1940.(2) The qualitative and local nature of war-time unemployment isemphasized by the widely differing experience of different districts and industries.(3) The slow rate at which industry is being re-adjusted to war needs and conditions is illustrated by the widespread increases of unemployment among insured females.(4) Bottle-neck unemployment is illustrated both by the unemploymentof women (including the large number of new claimants) and by theidleness of substantial numbers of employable men; until the skilled menare there to start the new factories, the unskilled men and the womencannot be set to work.(5) A substantial proportion of all firms in engineering and allied tradeshad capacity available for additional Government work, in June, 1940.

Wage Policy and the Terms of Civilian Employment in War.    (W.H.B.)The Policy of Self-Determination in Industry.In peace-time wage rates are determined in most industries by collective bargaining between associations of employers and employees. The collectivebargains usually provide for rates varying from one district to another. In most highly organised industries there is objection on the part of employers and work-j,eopie alike to any statutory regulation of wages, such as applies to agricultureor industries subject to Trade Boards; there is objection also to compulsory arbitration.   This objection has been modified in war, insofar as employers and
workpeople have agreed that where collective bargaining fails to lead to agree-ment, there shall follow arbitration about wages in place of stoppage of work by lock-out or strike. Apart from this, up to the present, the general policy has been to preserve as much as possible the peace-time practice of self-deter-mination in industry, even in the application of the new measures of controlrequired by war, such as the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act of May, 1940,and the conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order, 1940.Under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act of 22nd May, 1940, defence regulations can be made &quot; requiring persons to place themselves, their servicesand their property at the disposal of His Majesty &quot;. Regulations made thesame day authorise the Minister of Labour and National Service to &quot; directany person in the United Kingdom to perform such services in the UnitedKingdom as may be specified by the direction, being services which that person,is in the opinion of the Minister, capable of performing &quot;. The services are tobe performed upon such terms as to remuneration and conditions of service asthe Minister may, in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, direct.Then comes a provision of great importance. &quot; In determining the terms uponwhich any such services are to be performed, the Minister shall have regard toany rates of salary, fees or wages for the performance of those services which appear to the Minister to be usual, and, in particular, in the case of servicesusually rendered under a contract of service, shall have regard to any determina-tion relating to the remuneration and conditions of service of persons employedin the district in the capacity and in the trade in which the person to whomthe direction relates is to serve, being a determination contained in an agreementbetween organisations representative of employers and workers or in a decisionof a Joint Industrial Council, conciliation board, arbitration tribunal or other similar body, or, in the absence of any such determination, shall have regard tothe remuneration and conditions of service in practice prevailing among goodemployers in that trade in the district &apos;&quot;.This proviso is intended to secure that remuneration of all kinds for civilianservice or employment in war shall continue so far as possible to be determinedby the same machinery as in peace. The same principle underlies and limits the provision of war-time arbitration in place of stoppage of work, in the caseof trade disputes.The Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order 1940, which came into force on 25th July, 1940, was based on recommendations of a Con-consultative Committee of persons representing employers&apos; and workmen&apos;s organisa-tions, which include among other things the following: &quot;The machinery of negotiation existing in any trade or industry for dealing with questions concerningwages and conditions of employment shall continue to operate. Matters in disputewhich cannot be settled by means of such machinery shall be referred to arbi-tration for a decision which will be binding on the parties and no strike Orlock-out shall take place.&quot; In accord with this recommendation, the Orderprovides that either party to a trade dispute may report it to the Minister,but that if there is in the trade or industry concerned collective joint machinery which is suitable for settling the dispute, the Minister must refer the dispute tothat machinery. The arbitration tribunal enters only after breakdown of the collective machinery.The policy of the Control of Employment regulations and of the national arbitration Order is clear: to preserve so far as possible self-determination in industry and to avoid so far as possible any direct Government responsibility orinterference in regard to wages and terms of employment. The policy is natural.It is in accord with the ideals of self-determination in industry and the growingimpt)rtance between the two wars of collective bargaining. It is a recognition by the Government of the great services which associations of employers andworkpeople can render and are rendering towards the mobilisation of industry for national purposes. But it may be doubted whether this policy carried topoint indicated above is a good policy for war, or takes account of the funda-mental distinction between the economics of war and of peace.Difference of War and Peace Conditions.In peace-time self-determination of wages has the economic justification of allowing the remuneration of those engaged in each industry to be related to its
prosperity, which, in theory is some indication of its importance to the com-m unity and of the desirability either of attracting additional labour to it orof reducing its total labour force. In war-time the position is different. Thecontinuance in war of peace-time methods of determining wages sets up un-uecessary frictions in securing the most effective use of the man-power of thecountry.First, differences of local wage rates established in peace-time on the assumption of a relatively stable local distribution of the population, are obstacles to the rapid changes of local distribution required in war. The low wage ratescharacteristic of certain mining areas whose production it would be in thenational interest to develop at this moment are an obstacle to attracting minersfrom other districts where for many reasons less labour is required. The highwage rates characteristic of London hinder transference of labour away from london, though this transference is urgently needed for many reasons. Thedifficulty here is not one of wage-rates alone; London is a region also of highrents and lodging allowances which may be sufficient for those who move fromother towns but insufficient for the maintenance of two homes, when one is inLondon. This consideration reinforces the general conclusion as to the unsuit-ability of peace-time systems of remuneration to the requirements of war.Second, the differing wage rates established for different industries in peace-timebear no relation to the relative importance of these industries in war. some industries which should be contracted have relatively high rates, which those used to them are unwilling to abandon as long as questions of personal gain are allowed to play their present part in the selection of civilian work. some industries with relatively low wages are among those in which the retentionof their full present labour force, or additions to it, are required in war; iron-stone mining, food processing, agriculture, are obvious current illustrations.Third, over a substantial and growing part of industry, bargaining between employers and workpeople about wages has lost its logical basis, because theState rather than the employer will ultimately foot the bill for wages. ExcessProfits Tax at 100 per cent, make this position general in nearly all expandingtrades. In industries directly concerned with armaments, where existing firms have been commissioned to establish new factories at Government expense, theyhave until recently had no means of collecting the necessary skilled labour, except by offering financial inducements; though restricted as a rule in regard to time-rates they have been able to give such inducements by way of special bonusesor exceptionally liberal piece-rates, or abundant overtime.The Fixing of Piece-Rates.A report made in May, 1940, by an Inter-departmental Committee on MunitionsWages shows clearly the course of events:  &quot; Although the policy embodied in the Piece-Work Agreement, to whichall federated engineering firms subscribe, is to fix prices in such a manner as to ensure to the average worker at least 25 per cent, above his basic rate,it is common knowledge that current earnings are generally far in excessof that figure.&quot; Piece-work bonus earnings in the majority of old established firms(allowing for the increased effort to meet present needs which has raised the average figure from about 30 per cent, to between 40 and 50 per cent.)are not very different from what would have been expected. The newerfirms and firms which have only recently undertaken large scale armamentproduction as well as shadow factories, however, have fixed piece-workprices which allow their operators to earn a bonus of 100 per cent, or more.This Sub-Committee feels that such percentages are the result of a deliberate high rate-fixing policy.&quot;There has been a well-marked distinction in certain districts of policy between&quot; aggressive &quot; firms seeking to attract labour at any cost at the cost of theGovernment for new factories and large extensions, and older firms endeavour-ing to keep to the normal relation between time-rates and piece-work earnings.This method of collecting skilled men by poaching from other employers, what-ever its advantages to the individual firm, is useless as a general policy and
has now been checked,, to some extent, by the Undertakings (Restriction ohEngagement) Order requiring that in certain industries all engagements mustbe made through Employment Exchanges. As is shown below, control of move-ment and even of poaching through this Order is far from complete and earlierpoaching practice has already established the possibility of making very highearnings in certain types of armament work, particularly in repetition workrequiring skill, but not skill of the highest order. Whatever view may be held as to the proper distribution of the total national income between wage earnersand others in peace time, this particular development has two disadvantages in war. In the first place, high money earnings cannot be made general except by inflation, that is to say, by raising all money wages and prices in the face of a necessarily diminished production of commodities; this deprives all wage earners alike of any real advantage from their nominal increase of earnings.Those who now have these high earnings will find their expectations of prosperitydefeated and will be discontented; alternatively, if the general rise of wagesand prices is prevented, these particular workpeople will have a privileged posi-tion, causing resentment elsewhere. There is no escape from this dilemma.In the second place, reliance upon the motive of personal gain to secure men for the performance of necessary work in war, rather than on motives of service,places upon a wrong psychological basis the attitude to industrial work. Itleads to perpetual movement of workpeople from one place to another in searchof high earnings. It encourages the view that a workman in war is free to leavehis work, whatever its importance, to please himself or to please his wife.Inequality of Earnings.The high earnings of certain limited classes of armament workers are un-doubtedly a source of weakness in our economic organisation to-day. The maintrouble, however, is not high earnings, but inequality of earnings; there are many cases of low or reduced earnings to set against the  10 or  12 earnings of some munitioneers. From the different practice of different firms in regardto piece-work there have resulted large discrepancies between the earnings opento men of equal skill doing work of equal importance in neighbouring factories.These discrepancies have been increased by variations in the extent of over-time and Sunday work, which has continued to be treated on peace-time lines as occasion for double-pay. Since men cannot for any length of time work forseven days a week this has led in some cases to men working Sunday and taking another day off instead. Firms which did not offer the chance of Sundaywork have found men leaving them or refusing to come to them.To-day, while some men have a prospect of unexpected prosperity, others,whose work is as essential in the national interest, find that their work leads to much lower earnings, or even to heavy loss, by those who undertake it.The main feature of the wage situation to-day is not excessive earnings, butextreme inequality of earnings, bearing little or no relation to the importanceor the difficulty of the tasks to be performed.Responsibility of Government.The Government cannot organise man-power of the country for essentialcivilian work as well as for military service without taking direct responsibilityfor the remuneration and the terms of employment in each case. It cannotbring about with sufficient speed the change of industrial structure required,while leaving the peace-time wage structure and bargaining machinery. Tokeep people at their present jobs at a loss of wages causes resentment. Tomove people from their present jobs to other jobs at a heavy loss of wagesis liable, with the present psychology, to cause such resentment that it has notbeen attempted. In practice, in one form or another, the Government, if itwishes to organise man-power, must take responsibility in regard to wages.It has been driven to that in regard to agriculture; it should be prepared todo it systematically and openly. This does not mean discarding the wholepeace-time machinery for determining wages, but using it subject to Governmentdirections in accord with the general plan. It does not mean that the greatassociations of employers and workpeople which make industrial democracy in
peace have no part to play in war. It means only that they, iike the privatecitizen, should become the organs not of private or sectional interests but ofnational policy.National policy in respect of wages in war is the responsibility of the Govern-ment. No one else has the requisite knowledge or power. Wages have beendiscussed above only under one aspect that of removing friction in the use oflabour and securing justice and content among wage-earners. There are wider aspects no less important. The treatment of wages is inseparable from thetreatment of other issues, of prices and of the financing of war. What happensto wages affects all these other problems, as their treatment affects wages.There is no need to discuss more fully in this memorandum these wider aspectsof the wages problem, because they have already been the subject of memorandafrom other sources. Here wages are considered essentially in relation to theorganisation of labour.In this aspect, the problem of wages in war is part only of the general problemof the treatment of civilian employment in war. In order to put forwardits whole strength in total war, the Government must in practice and notmerely in theory secure that every member of the industrial army goes where he is wanted, and stays where he is wanted; does not refuse a transfer withoutgood reason; does not make a transfer or cease work without good reason.The industrial army must have the unity that marks the fighting forces andthe same spirit of obedience and sticking to one&apos;s post.Civilian Employment and Military Service.This does not mean that the industrial army must be subject to military discipline. In three important respects the treatment of those who serve ascivilians in employment should differ from the position of those who serve inthe fighting forces :  (a) There is no need to establish for civilian employment discipline byfines and imprisonment, administered by courts of law, such as the Muni-tions Tribunals of the last war. The existing methods of industrial dis-decipline within the factory are those to which workpeople are used andshould be sufficiently severe.(&amp;) All powers required for controlling the movement or distribution oflabour outside the factory must be exercised not by the employers butby the impartial authority of the State. When, for instance, it is clearthat some of the skilled men working for an employer should be trans-ferred by the Ministry of Labour to work elsewhere, the selection of men for transference should be made, not by the employer, but by a Ministryofficial after consulting both employer and workpeople. In a free com-munity workmen do not belong to an employer and cannot be &quot; released &quot;by him. Their services belong in war willingly to the State. Again,the well-founded objection to the &quot; Leaving Certificates &quot; of the last war was that they had to be given in the first instance by the employer and,though subject to appeal, could be used and even more widely, could besuspected of being used as an instrument of oppression on behalf of an individual employer, rather than as an instrument of regulation in thenational interest.(c) Any individual whose freedom in regard to keeping or leaving civilianemployment is affected by an Order of a Ministry of Labour officer shouldhave the opportunity of appeal to an impartial tribunal. There is no timefor appeals in the fighting army; there is time in the industrial army.The industrial army includes many people who, however patriotic and self-sacrificing, cannot be as mobile as the men of the fighting forces; one needmention only the married women who have a duty to their homes as wellas to their country. In the use of compulsory powers in industry theremust be adequate safeguards against hardship.Subject to those three conditions, organisation of man-power does mean thatworkpeople should be expected to go without question to work to which theyare told to go, and to stay at that work if they are told to stay, on termslaid down by the Government.This principle is implied in the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, but themethods of applying the principle are open to criticism in addition to what is said
about wages. At present under the Undertakings (Restriction on Engagement)Order, movement of labour is controlled in two ways. First, workpeople cannotbe engaged for employment in certain industries building, civil engineering, con-tracting, general engineering except through a local office of the Ministry ofLabour. Second, workpeople normally employed in agriculture or coal-miningcannot be engaged for employment in any other industry except through alocal office.Neither of these provisions directly prevents a man from leaving the work onwhich he is engaged, however important it may be. But under the emergency powers Act a workman who has left a job can be directed to return to it.Labour Turnover in Coventry and elsewhere.None of the current statistics now obtained by the Ministry of Labour makeit possible to say how large is the labour turnover in the munitions industries as a whole. A special return obtained by the Ministry of Supply from 133 firmsemploying 228,606 persons at 24th August, 1940, shows that in the four weeksending on that day 10,410 workpeople were taken on while 5,565 left, that is tosay, the outflow was more than half the inflow. The immediate unsatisfieddemand for workpeople, i.e. those who could have been got to work at once,if available, was 11,457. Of the 5,565 who left, 3,918 left for reasons other thanbeing called to the armed forces or at the request of a Ministry of Labour official.This unnecessary movement, while affecting a small proportion of the total labour force, 1 - 7 per cent, a month or about zo per cent, a year, is obviouslysufficient to make the continuity of work less than it need be.In particular towns, such as Coventry, the leaving of jobs in pursuit of higher earnings elsewhere is reported as a common event. In this town duringthe week ending 21st September, 83 men wishing to change their jobs wereinterviewed by the Labour Supply Committee. Of these, 47 were told to returnto their firms, while 36 were released for other employment. Of the 83 wishing to change their jobs, 55 did so because they were not satisfied with their wages.In the following week 109 men wishing to change their jobs were interviewedby the Committee. Of those 66 sought higher wages, 15 wished to return home,28 put forward other reasons; 55 were allowed to change, and in most cases, were directed to their new jobs, while the rest were directed to return to their oldemployers. These interviews represent only a part of the total turnover; inspec-tors, Exchange managers and trade union secretaries are kept busy with manycases which do not reach the Labour Supply Committee.The Chief Labour Supply Officer comments as follows: &quot; I would like to draw attention to the difficulty which confronts us, and will confront us, as long as thewages vary in the different factories in this locality from approximately ^5 to ^16per week.&quot; The Exchange Manager confirms this range of earnings as applying to skilled fitters, naming the factories in which the maxima and minima occur.Variation in the production earnings affect the toolroom earnings, under thearrangement which, by relating the wage of the skilled tool makers to theaverage of the production shop, was designed to remove some of the seriousgrievances of the last war. Variation of production earnings from factory tofactory involves a corresponding difference in the pay of toolroom workers,amounting to at least is. an hour in this same town.Whatever the scale on which unnecessary movement of men from job to jobtakes place, it must have some harmful effect by disorganising production. Thefact that most men stick to their jobs suggests that a general rule directed to stopping unnecessary change, subject to safeguards against hardship, would meet with general acceptance. As appears from the information given aboveabout Coventry, the Labour Supply Committees succeed in sending back to theirpresent jobs a fair proportion of the men who wish to leave them. But it is open to question whether the procedure now in force is the best that couldbe adopted. The industries named in the Undertakings (Restriction onEngagement) Order are by no means the only industries where movementof men from their present jobs may seriously impede war effort. even within the scope of that Order, the method of control attempted presentsdifficulties. The right of any man at any time to leave his job howeverimportant, is nowhere challenged.   After he has left, it falls to the Exchange
Manager to persuade him to return, with a threat of compulsion in the background. This plan seems more likely to cause resentment that a straight-forward regulation, making it the duty of men to remain at their work unlesseither they are authorised by the Exchange Manager to leave it and go elsewhere,or having been refused authorisation by the Manager, they are able on appeal toan independent tribunal to establish a good cause for leaving. In this form,control of employment directed to secure continuity on vital work would not he open to the substantial objections raised against the leaving certificate ofthe last war. It could be limited in the first instance to employments specifiedas of national importance.Control of Employment presumes Control of Wages.But it has to be repeated that any prohibition of free movement of menfrom one job to another will cause justifiable discontent if the State makes no attempt to secure that, whatever the job on which he is engaged, the workman receives a remuneration that is fair, having regard both to the costof living and to the opportunities of other workmen. A sense of fair treatment in such a matter is essential. The British people in war are capable of under-standing the need for discipline, but with discipline they must have justiceWhatever the responsibility of the State for securing social justice in peace-time,it cannot escape that responsibility in war.It is easier to describe the present and prospective difficulties in regard towages than to present a clear cut list of remedies. Assuming, however, that theGovernment came to the conclusion that it was dangerous to allow the present policy to continue, the first step would naturally be to consult the representative organisations of employers and workers as to the possible lines of an alternative policy, involving greater State responsibility for dealing with wages and incomes.The programme laid before these organisations as a basis for discussion might include the following suggestions:  (i) that the established machinery for negotiating wages and conditionsof employment should continue, subject to the condition that any generalchange of wage rates should require the approval of a wages tribunal to beestablished by the Government;(2) that it would be open to the organisations who were discussing wage* questions before reaching an agreement to consult the tribunal;(3) that the tribunal should apply a general policy laid down by theGovernment;(4) that in all &quot; controlled undertakings &quot; there should be control on behalfof the Government both of salaries and of individual piece-rates, bonusesand special conditions.(5) that the earnings that could be made by men of equal skill doingsimilar work in the same district should, so far as possible, be standardised.The difficult question would still remain whether in any revision of wages therewould need to be levelling down as well as levelling up. It is hard to see how,if justice is to be secured, some levelling down of the extreme cases of highearnings could be avoided. Probably this could be brought about with leastfriction if it were part of some general reconstruction of the financial relationsbetween the State and the factories and involved a taking over of factories.c. Training for War-Work.   (G.H.H.C.)   (8th August 1940.)It is increasingly apparent that the two really serious shortages in the supplyof labour, apart from local or temporary shortages, are, first, the shortage oftoolroom workers able to work to very high degrees of precision, and secondlythe shortage of competent setters of capstan and automatic lathes and othermachine tools. Reports came in from one firm and area after another thatif these two main deficiencies could be remedied very much larger quantitiesof unskilled or relatively unskilled labour could be employed in the munitionstrades. It is the shortage of these types of workers and not, as a rule, a shortageof suitable labour for the less skilled jobs that is seriously holding up productionand will prevent any large-scale absorption of fresh labour into the munitions industries unless it can be put right.
It follows from this that it will be useless either to make broadcastappeals for unskilled recruits to munition-making or to train large masses ofunskilled workers as machine operators unless and until adequate supplies ofsetters are available and toolrooms are able to meet the demands made upon them for an increased output of tools, jigs, etc., to match the desired expansion in the production departments. Nor can it be easy in practice to train largenumbers even for relatively simple machine operations without a big increase inthe supply of competent instructors.a.These considerations suggest that, in drawing up an amended and expandedtraining scheme to meet prospective needs, special attention ought to be givento these three aspects of the problem. Training schemes will inevitably break-down unless prompt measures are taken (a) to expand the capacity of toolroomsto cover a larger total volume of output, (6) to increase greatly the supply ofpersons capable of setting up machines to be operated by less skilled workers,and also the supply of workers capable of setting up their own jobs; and (c) toprovide an increased body of instructors capable of undertaking training of thesimpler types designed to turn out competent machine operators. These threeproblems present very different degrees of difficulty, and need tackling largely by different methods.i. Toolrooms. The toolroom problem is much the most difficult, becausecompetent toolroom workers capable of working to high degrees of precisioncannot be quickly made either out of unskilled workers or even out of quiteskilled production workers who do not possess the requisite degree of highintelligence and adaptability. Even with long training, only a minority of the skilled men in the production departments of works could be made into goodtoolroom workers. It follows that the selection of men to undergo training fortoolroom work requires the greatest care, and that nothing in the nature of mass-training for this purpose is even remotely possible. The men suitable for train-ing will be among the very best now in the production departments, and willnot be easy to replace by other workers in their existing jobs. They can, in fact,be replaced only by the successful application of dilution and substitution ofother types of workers in the production departments.This being the case, the toolroom problem is clearly a problem of trainingonly in part. The first indispensable thing is to make the existing supply of skilled toolroom workers go as far as possible. This can best be done by ensuring the greatest possible continuity of output in each works or department, so as toreduce to a minimum the skilled labour of making jigs and tools for new jobs.This depends largely on the policy followed in distributing&quot; contracts and sub-contracts, and is the subject of a separate memorandum.Even if everything possible is done to economise in the use of toolroom labour,the problem will remain serious.   It can be handled only in two ways(a) by taking suitable skilled production workers, and putting them through a short course of toolroom training, either in the works in whichthey are employed, or in a Technical College or similar institution possessingthe necessary equipment and staff of highly skilled instructors;(b) by recruiting highly skilled workers who are accustomed to working to fine limits from trades not essential for war production, and putting suchworkers through a course of training, similar to that proposed in (a), butusually somewhat longer. This type of training will need to be given, asa rule, in a Technical College or similar institution, and may have to begiven in the area to which the men belong rather than in the area where theywill be called upon to work after they have been trained (e.g. it will benecessary to train Londoners in London, even if they are likely to be sentelsewhere after training).(c) by finding and transferring from non-essential branches of engineeringwork the skilled men of high cjuality who have been used to measurementjobs on centre lathes and other machines, such as the best type of garagehands, men from the maintenance departments of local authorities andother institutions and from big works in non-essential industries, where necessary giving such men intensive short courses in toolroom work.
23(d) by training juvenile workers of a high type of intelligence for certaintoolroom jobs which can be so arranged as to require only a very narrowrange of skill, such as school-leavers from higher grade schools have shown themselves able to acquire very rapidly, when proper training facilities havebeen provided.The provision for these four forms of training is at present quite inadequate;indeed, except in a very few firms, it hardly exists in any systematic shape.A good many firms doubtless make some sort of rudimentary provision under(a), and a very few under (d); but (6) and (c) are practically non-existent.It should be an important function of the authority responsible for training to ensure both that big works make adequate provision for training toolroomworkers from among their own skilled craftsmen, on a basis of careful personalselection and also when possible for training high-grade juveniles on the lines suggested, and further, that facilities for toolroom training available in technical colleges and similar institutions be sought out wherever they exist and affordedwhere they do not exist by the provision of the requisite tools, machines andstaffs of highly skilled instructors.This is well worth doing, even if the instructors have to be taken largely from among the scarcest types of toolroom workers and the trainees selected from among the most skilled men in the production departments. By no othermethod can the output of munitions of types requiring large numbers of specialtools and jigs be increased in the long run. The very slight slowing down of immediate output which might be caused by the temporary removal of the menconcerned from direct employment on current production would be amplyrepaid a few months later, when the additional supply of toolroom workers would make possible a great increase in the employment of less skilled grades of labour.II. Setting-up. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is useless to trainlarge numbers of machine minders who are unable to set up their own jobsunless this process is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the supplyof setters. Now, setting-up is not in itself a job that necessarily calls for avery high degree of craftsmanship. What it does require, in the majority ofcases, is intelligence and the ability to work from scale drawing, and to under-stand blue prints. Moreover, the qualifications needed for setting up a singlemachine are of a different. order from those required of a workman who may-be called upon to set up jobs of many different kinds on many differentmachines. The latter type of setter cannot be produced quickly in largenumbers, any more than toolroom workers can be quickly mass-produced. But,given the right material, workers capable of setting a single type of machineon a fairly narrow scope of jobs can be trained very rapidly, and can be usedto increase output in many branches of munitions work. It is important thattraining of fully qualified setters of the first type should proceed rapidly, inthe main by selection from the existing body of fully skilled or nearly skilledcapstan operators; but in view of the inevitable slowness of this process, it is indispensable that there shall be an immensely increased provision for trainingsetters of the second, single-purpose type.On certain types of light work on small machines the material for this second type of training is most likely to be found among young workers of high educational standard and general intelligence, recruited from Secondary,Central and Junior Technical Schools at or after the age of 16, and put throughintensive courses either in special training shops established in big factories,or in Technical Colleges or similar institutions. For other types of work themain fields for recruitment will be found (a) among highly skilled craftsmendrawn from industries other than engineering and possessing high intelligence and the habit of using it in the handling of difficult machines (e.g. in the printing or textile or boat trades, or in metal trades not directly useful in thewar effort, or in woodworking); (6) among adults drawn from the professions andpossessing mechanical aptitude as well as high educational qualifications; (c) anyupgraded workers who are not quite good enough to become all-round setters-up,but can be trained to set up a single type of machine for others as well as for themselves.One important means of discovering the right workers to be trained as settersof either of the above types is to ensure that workers now operating machines
are given every possible encouragement to learn to set up their own jobs,and that no obstacles shall be put in the way of their doing this on grounds of traditional practice. Night-shifts, at present commonly very much under-manned for lack of setters, provide many opportunities for helping operatorsto learn how to set up their own machines; and learning to do this may bein many cases the first step towards selection for special training as regularsetters-up.It is important that the encouragement to workers to learn to set up theirown machines should be extended to women as well as men, and that factoriesemploying women in substantial numbers as operators should have specialwomen&apos;s training courses through which the right individuals can be chosenand taught how to set up their own machines. It is nonsense to say that womencannot be taught to set up. A considerable number did so successfully in thelast war; and some, though very few, are doing so to-day in face of malescepticism.One great obstacle to a rapid increase in the number of setters-up is thatthe job is apt to appear much more difficult than it really is, when it is firstput before a worker unpractised in working from drawings. It is in fact much easier to make single purpose setters-up out of intelligent persons with littlecraft-skill, but possessing a capacity to read drawings and to do simple mathe-matics, than it is to make a good setter-up out of an experienced operator wholacks these educational qualifications. Part of the battle in training setters-upis to help the trainee over his or her initial fears of inability to do the job;when confidence is fostered it is not difficult for intelligent persons, especially if they are young and adaptable, to be trained very rapidly, provided that thepurpose is only to train them to set up a single type of machine.III. Instructors. A greatly extended supply of instructors is needed, not only for training the types of workers discussed in I and II, but, even more, for the mere training of less skilled types of machine operators who will be neededas the supplies of setters and toolroom workers are increased. Instructorscapable of undertaking the forms of training described in I and II cannot bemass-produced. They must be drawn from the staffs of existing TechnicalInstitutions or from the ranks of the skilled workers in engineering and kindredoccupations. This makes it the more important that men capable of givingthese highly skilled types of instruction shall not be wasted in instructing jobswhich can be done by persons of lower skill or qualifications.It is, therefore, necessary to provide a large new body of instructors capable,with some help from instructors and technicians of superior grades, of under-taking the major part of the work of training unskilled workers in short coursesdesigned to teach a sufficient dexterity in simple machine operations which do not involve setting-up of the job by the operator. It would be falseeconomy to seek to choose these instructors exclusively from the ranks of the skilled engineering craftsmen, who cannot be spared in anything like sufficient numbers from productive work.There is accordingly an urgent need for special courses designed to traininstructors of this second type. One important source of trainees for this par-ticular job is to be found among handicraft teachers and instructors accustomed to training workers in processes outside the engineering trades, e.g. in &apos;wood-working, printing, and many other non-essential trades. These types ofinstructors, already attached for the most part to technical institutions andtrade schools, or working under the local authorities, should be mobilised and rapidly trained in the requisite knowledge of the machine operations for whichmass training is needed. Similarly, many mechanically minded persons includ-ing some teachers of non-craft subjects, could readily be given the degree of machine knowledge and skill required to enable them to apply their ability to teach to the special purpose for which they can be most useful in time ofwar. Suitable persons for training as instructors in this field could also be-found among foremen and supervisors released from non-essential trades, and among compositors and other craftsmen outside the metal industries who possesshigh intelligence and machine aptitude. Instruction of this type, given a certain minimum of technical knowledge, is more a matter of ability to teach andgeneral intelligence than of practical craftsmanship in the engineering tricks.
2IV. A Mobile Squad of Instructors.-lt is suggested that one of the bestways of relieving rapidly the at present acute shortage of setters would be toorganise a mobile squad of instructors, who could be sent from factory tofactory for the single purpose of increasing the number of men capable of setting their own machines and also the number capable of being employed as setters of machines operated by other workers. It has been pointed out to how serious an extent the shortage of setters is preventing the institution of adequate manning of shifts, especially night shifts. Clearly the quickest wayof relieving this shortage is to recruit more setters from among theexisting employees of the factories concerned. But the setters now employedin these factories are much too busy to take on the job of training others to relieve them, except on a quite inadequate scale. A mobile squad of settinginstructors, organised regionally and moving from factory to factory at need,could, it is believed, help greatly in relieving this pressure.Naturally, the members of such a squad would need to possess a high degreeof skill. But they need not be physically very strong; for they would not haveto stand the pace of modern wartime production, nor need they be employed for very long hours. They could be recruited largely from highly skilled oldermen now working in small establishments or on maintenance, or retired; andit is likely that the new Industrial Registration Order will make it possibleto recruit a squad of this type without taking skilled men off essential production.It would of course be necessary to give the skilled men selected for this job aspecial course of refresher training, which could be of varying length accordingto the needs of each individual. The members of the squad could be enrolledon a basis similar to that of the War Munition Volunteers in the last war, sothat they could be sent wherever they were most needed. But it would be preferable to work the scheme largely on a regional basis, owing to local and regional differences in engineering practices and products and in the types of machines chiefly used.B.These three aspects of the training problem have been put in the forefrontof this memorandum both because they are the keys to the wider problemof training as a whole, and because they have been hitherto very generallyneglected. If these three parts of the problem can be satisfactorily solved,the remaining aspects will present relatively little difficulty, beyond thatof large-scale organisation and the building up of the appropriate forms ofenergetic co-operation between the Ministry of Labour, the Board of Education,the Technical Colleges, Polytechnics and other technical institutions, and thetraining departments or sections established in the factories themselves.The main forms of training still to be considered are (a) the training of semi-skilled workers to take the places of fully skilled workers required for operations which demand the highest types of skill; (6) the training of unskilledor nearly unskilled workers, as semi-skilled machine operators possessing afair degree of adaptability to a variety of processes and machines; (c) thetraining of skilled workers from non-essential trades as skilled or semi-skilledmachine operators for munitions work; and (d) the mass training of unskilled workers as machine operators or feeders on automatic or semi-automatic machinesset up by more skilled workers. A fifth problem (e) the training of skilled men byway of several years&apos; apprenticeship, is not dealt with in this memorandum,which is confined to the special problems which have become urgent in viewof wartime needs.V. Upgrading of semi-skilled workers. The upgrading of semi-skihed, crnarrowly skilled workers to jobs normally done by fully skilled craftsmen isnot in the main a problem of training in the ordinary sense of the term. it comes rather under the heading of dilution (which is discussed in a separate memorandum), and it is a (matter to be handled mainly in the works.Where, however, close relations exist between a factory and a Technical Collegeor similar institution, or when such relations can be established, it can beof very great help to send men selected for upgrading to part-time coursesoutside the works, where they can be taught to work from drawings and given some knowledge of the basic properties of the materials handled, and perhaps
some simple mathematical instruction. Alternatively, these forms of instructioncan be provided in the works, where the requisite facilities exst; but the worksable to undertake these tasks are likely in present circumstances to be few,and it seems desirable to make the fullest possible use of outside technicalinstitutions.Often, of course, upgrading may involve dividing the job, so as. to separate the more and less exacting processes hitherto in the hands of the skilledcraftsmen. Where this is the case, there is a specially strong reason for doing the practical part of the required training in the works, in order that it maybe directly related to the actual processes which the upgraded worker will becalled upon to undertake. This part of the subject will not be discussed furtherhere, as it will be dealt with more fully in the memorandum on dilution.VI. Training of semi-skilled workers. The training of semi-skilled workers on lines designed to produce men possessed of a fairly high degree of adaptabilityto different processes and machines has been the main work in recent yearsof the Government Training Centres, identified hereafter by their initials asG.T.Cs. It has taken the form of courses of high quality extending overseveral (usually six) months; and though, under pressure of the rapidly expandingdemand for trainees, something is now being done to shorten courses as well asto increase the number of Centres and provide for their more intensive use,it is clear that the courses cannot be greatly shortened without destroying their essential character and cutting away the source of an exceptionally usefultype of semi-skilled labour. It may be desirable to make use of some ofthe G.T.Cs. for certain parts of the training provisions outlined in sections &apos;I to IV;but it would be a calamity if the G.T.Cs. were driven to alter the essentialcharacter by being converted into mass-training establishments of the type con-templated in section VII. They are not suited for this work, and to use them for it would be to waste their excellent equipment and staff, and to divert them from this very necessary task of turning out semi-skilled tradesmen for industry or for the armed forces. It is to be hoped that energetic resistance will be offered to all attempts to use the G.T.Cs. for very short courses designedmerely to train machine-minders in a single process or machine.The experience built up over a period of years in the G.T.Cs. makes it unnecessary to discuss at length the problems arising in respect of the trainingof semi-skilled workers of a fairly high degree of adaptability. It is clear-that this type of training should be such as to offer the trainee who successfullyfinishes the course a reasonable prospect of permanent employment in the industry for which he has been trained, not merely while the war lasts, but also in timeof peace. This has always been the function of the G.T.Cs., and it is entirelyinconsistent with the aim of training single-purpose machine-operators with adirect view to the wartime needs of a particular factory. The G.T.Cs. shouldbe expanded as rapidly as possible, and courses of a similar type should be instituted under Scheme M in Technical institutions and perhaps also in factories,etc., not fully engaged on essential work. As dilution proceeds, there will beample room for all the trainees of this type whom it will be possible to produce,in face of the shortage of skilled instructors and machine tools, and of &quot;theclaims of the other forms of training described in sections I to IV. This typeof training must not, however, be confused or muddled up with the inferiortype required for the mass-production of single-purpose machine-operators indirect relation to wartime needs.VII. Training of skilled workers Transferred from non-essential Industries. Certain special problems arise in connection with the training for munitions work of workers already highly skilled whose skill is not directly usable forwar purposes. One aspect of this problem is the adaptation of skilled workers to war processes fairly closely related to those on which they have normallybeen employed. Examples are the training of plumbers as lead-burners, ofsilversmiths as coppersmiths, and of workers in the brass trades for cognatework on other metals. These specialised forms of training clearly require special arrangements, which must be worked out in each case in consultation both with the Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations concerned and with TradeSchools and Technical Institutions familiar with the processes involved.   These
questions are not discussed here, as they are highly technical, and generalisa-tions about them are of little value. It is, however, clearly important thatadaptations of this type should be made wherever there are practicablemeans of relieving shortages of skilled labour, and that it should be the businessof the Training Department to co-ordinate and foster arrangements in co-operation with the trades concerned.Somewhat different methods are necessary where it is a question of trainingskilled workers in a technique radically different from their own e.g., com-positors as metal machinists, or woodworking machinists as metal machinists.Here the foundation on which the new technique has to be built is rather the intelligence of the skilled man, and his familiarity with machine technique ingeneral, than knowledge of a closely related process. Enough has alreadybeen accomplished in the printing trades to show that large opportunities for transfers of this second type exist; and the fostering of arrangementsfor the training which is necessary should play an important part in the activi-ties of the authority responsible for the promotion of training as a whole.Here too, however, the problems differ so much from trade to trade thatgeneralisations are not of much use. Certain of the appendices* will serve to indicate both what has been done in these two fields and what are the obstacles to a wider development of these forms of transference. As employersrealise that it is impossible to satisfy their full demand for skilled workers of the types they would like to get, arrangements for the adaptation ofdifferent kinds of skill to wartime uses will necessarily acquire an ever-increasing importance.VIII. Mass Training of Machine Operators. It has already been made clearthat the extent to which the mass-training of machine-operators on simpleprocesses can be pushed depends (a) on the success achieved in overtakingthe existing shortages of toolroom workers and setters-up, and (b) on a great increase in the number of available instructors. It is also clearly dependenton the supplies of machine tools and of materials, which, together with skilled labour, set the final limits on the possible expansion of war output. In thissection, it will be assumed that these problems are in process of solution, andthat there is accordingly room for a big increase in the employment of unskilled workers, not only in shell filling and similar operations, but also on automaticand semi-automatic machines.Clearly, the existing resources of the Government Training Centres and of most of the Technical Colleges and similar institutions (or at least of theseengineering departments) will be fully required for the higher forms of trainingalready discussed, and will accordingly not be available for training of thisinferior kind. Provision for it must therefore be made elsewhere; and clearly the right place for it, at any rate in a very large number of cases, is in the works in which the workers are likely to be employed after they have been trained.There are several reasons for this. In the first place, training in the workscan be more directly related than training outside to the particular processeswhich the workers will be called upon to perform. Secondly, the trainees willbe learning the factory atmosphere, and will more easily adapt themselves tothe routine of production when the period of training is over. Thirdly, it willbe easier to select and to reject at an early stage those who are and are not suitable to the particular jobs waiting to be filled. Fourthly, the carrying on of the training in the factory will give the trainees a greater sense of being on war work, and will make them keener to do well and to learn quickly. Fewerwill give up in face of early difficulties. Fifthly, it will be easier to economiseon materials by the use of factory scrap, and also to put to manufacturing usesuch part of the product of the trainees as reaches a satisfactory quality.Sixthly, it will be possible to mix training both with the watching under factoryconditions of the processes which are being learnt, and with practice on machineswhich are temporarily idle owing to absenteeism or any other cause, or whennightshifts are thinly manned.It will not, however, be possible to conduct nearly all the training of thissimple type in the factories in which the trainees are to be employed.   The* Not printed but available in typescript as appendices to Memorandum N,
chief reason for this is that in many cases the trainees will have to be drawn from areas in which there is a surplus of labour, either unemployed or released from unessential trades, whereas the subsequent employment will be in areasin which labour is short. It would be most unwise to attempt mass transference of workers for training to the areas in which they will be needed, both because there is already an acute shortage of accommodation in many of these areas,so that it is most undesirable to increase congestion a day sooner than is absolutely necessary, and because by no means all the workers who begintraining will prove to be suitable or will in fact stay the course.It is therefore necessary to contemplate a large provision of training facilities in areas in which considerable unemployment either exists already (e.g., London)or is certain to arise as the non-essential industries are forced to contract then-output (e.g., Leicester, Nottingham). Even in areas where there is a shortage oflabour, it will be necessary in large towns to provide training facilities reasonablynear the homes of the trainees (e.g., where the expanding factories are situatedoutside the town in one direction, whereas the main surplus of labour is somemiles away on the other side, e.g., Birkenhead). When training of the typenow under discussion is organised apart from the works in which the traineesare likely to be employed, it is important to give it as far as possible in a factory atmosphere, and where possible to relate the product of the trainees toactual war needs, by providing for its use when it is up to standard in factoriesengaged on actual war production. Factories released by the contraction ofnon-essential industries will often be the most suitable places for the establish-ment of training courses of this type; and in some cases it will be possible toarrange with the management of the factory which is in danger of closing down a co-operative scheme for the rapid training of its existing personnel for thenew type of work, even where the factory is not suitable for conversion into a regular production unit for war purposes. Garages can also be used for this type of training; but in the writer&apos;s opinion there is a tendency to overstresstheir probable utility for this purpose. Of course, the extent to which convertedfactories can be used depends, like everything else, on an adequate supply of machines for use in training.Training in factories at present engaged in non-essential forms of production has the great advantage, when the existing personnel is to be trained, of building in the initial stage on the habits of collective work already developed in theestablishment, and to some extent easing the transition by securing theco-operation of the existing management. The maintenance problem is alsoeased when a factory is not being closed down, but is reducing its normal output,as the same maintenance staff can largely be used both for the parts of thefactory which continue the normal kind of production and for the parts devotedto training.Courses of the type considered in this section will normally be quite short from two weeks to two months at the very most. Their duration will vary from one individual to another, as workers can be transferred to direct production as fast as they acquire the necessary dexterity. The problem of providing theinstructors needed for such courses, especially where they are to be held outsidethe factories in which the trainees will find employment, has been discussed in sections III and IV.Training in the works may take various forms. Some establishments, especiallyvery large ones, will prefer to set up special training shops, whereas others willconduct works training in the various production departments. When a special training shop is set up, it will commonly be best for the trainees not to spendall their time in the special shop, but to be given an increasing chance as thecourse proceeds of operating machines under supervision in the productive depart-ments, as well as of merely watching. Where training is carried on in the worksitself, without a special training shop, it will often be best to attach each traineeto a particular machine and its regular operator, and similarly to give the traineeincreasing opportunities of actually working the machine during the trainingperiod. Training under these conditions merges into the normal process accom-accompanying  the engagement of new unskilled labour, and is liable to be perfunctory,unless care is taken to make provision for skilled and intelligent supervision.
2A separate training shop &apos;has great advantages where room can be found for it;but it is important that it should not be isolated from the rest of the works,and that the worker undergoing training should be given the opportunity of getting used to the regular routine of the productive departments.C.IX. The development of extensive schemes of training on the lines con-templated in this memorandum will give rise to many difficult financial andadministrative problems. On the financial side there will arise (indeed there hasalready arisen) the problem of the allowances to be paid to the workers duringthe period of training, both where absence from home is involved and wherethe training takes place near the worker&apos;s home or in his or her regular placeof employment. There arises also the question who is to pay the costs oftraining. Is the cost to be met by the Ministry of Labour, as in the caseof the Government Training Centres? Or, in the case of Works Schemes, is the employer to pay, and to recover the cost from the Supply Departments? Or,in the case of Technical Institutions, owned or supported by the LocalAuthorities, is part of the cost to be met through the Board of Education?It is not proposed, in the present memorandum, to attempt any detailed dis-cussion of these financial issues. It is, however, necessary to emphasise their importance and the danger that, if training schemes are allowed to develop with-put proper co-ordination of financial policy, most awkward financial complicationswill certainly arise, and serious discontent will be caused among trainees whofind themselves in a relatively unfavourable position. Clearly, the financial conditions applicable to the G.T.Cs. cannot be applied without large modifica-tions to the very different types of training here contemplated; nor can the same conditions be applied to the higher as to the more rudimentary forms of training.Recent circulars issued by the Ministry of Labour and by the Board of Educa-iion have by no means solved the financial problems involved in the greatexpansion and diversification of training facilities which are now contemplated;but these problems need to be solved speedily if a dangerous situation is notto arise.Nor have the administrative problems yet been solved.Training is so important that it ought to be regarded as the major labourproblem of the war at its present stage, and to be placed under the unifiedcontrol of an organisation centred in the Ministry of Labour and National Service (working of course in close collaboration with the Board of Education) and equipped to deal with every aspect of the problem and with all the agenciesnow at work upon its several parts. Government Training Centres, technical colleges and Institutes, Polytechnics and other more general Institutes possessingsuitable departments, Technical departments of Schools and Universities, and allkinds of specialised training branches and establishments, ought to come underthe unified control of this single organisation, which should deal also with workstraining, and with the special problem of providing new training facilities for various types of labour made available by the closing-down or contraction ofnon-essential occupations and by the narrowing of the channels for ordinaryemployment open to school-leavers in areas in which a large proportion of thenew entrants to employment have hitherto found work in such occupations.If it is argued that all these various aspects of the problem of training arealready being dealt with by one agency or another, the answer is twofold. It is,fust, that they are not in certain cases being dealt with on a nearly sufficientscale, and secondly that it is most unsatisfactory to have them dealt with byseparate agencies, when what is needed is a single organisation able to give itsundivided attention to the problem as a whole. Unless it is handled in this way,it will be impossible either to get a properly proportioned scheme, or to secureadequate attention to the many difficulties presented by the problem in its rela-tion to the siting and equipment of new factories, the arrangements forgeographical migration of workers, and the right relationship between schemesof training and the actual workshop conditions under which the trainees willsubsequently be called upon to work. Moreover, only by unified handling ofthe problem can the very difficult matter of providing competent instructors be somanaged as to put the available supply of such instructors to the most economical
use. Only by unified handling can training be so arranged as to interfere as little as possible with current production; and only by unified handling can itbe assured that the output of workers undergoing training is as useful as possible and is rightly adjusted to the demands of the supply departments.The case for a unified training department, in charge of all aspects of theproblem, is overwhelming. But it is also of the greatest importance that thisdepartment should proceed on the basis that training is not one problem but many, and that its different aspects require different, though inter-related,methods. It has been the principal purpose of this memorandum to bring outthe nature of these different aspects of the problem, and to suggest in broad outline the methods by which each of them can be best handled. The conclusionsherein reached are based in the main on the reports sent in from all parts of thecountry by the local investigators who have been working on the Local Man-Power Surveys conducted during July, and this memorandum is merely intro-ductory to the extracts from their reports which are available as an Appendix to memorandum N. With practical unanimity, these local investigators deplore the inadequacy of the existing arrangements for training of nearly all types, the misuseof Technical Colleges and other available institutions, and the lack of co-ordination between the various agencies or of any connected plan for dealing withthe training problem as a-whole. No doubt, some improvement has occurred during the past few weeks; but very much still remains to be done if the available supplies of man-power are to be put to effective use in meeting the needs of thewar industries.If the available man-power in Great Britain is to be fully used, there mustbe a great expansion in the employment on munitions and other essential workof men and women who have at present no skill in, or training for the engineering and other occupations in which this expansion will have to occur. This labour will be provided largely, though not exclusively, from the less essential occupa-tions, in which employment has shrunk already and will shrink much faster asthe additional measures for restricting normal consumer purchases produce their full effect. It would, however, be an entirely false economy to displaceworkers from the less essential occupations faster than they can be absorbed in more useful firms of production. So far from contributing to the war effort,a restriction on consumers&apos; supplies going so far as to cause unemployment wouldbe a positive waste of man-power, and would moreover weaken the nationaleffort by imposing unnecessary hardships on the consuming public.It has, however, already become evident that any really large transference ofworkers, beyond what is proceeding already, into the munitions industries de-pends on a much more effective utilisation of the limited supplies of highly skilled labour, by enabling this labour to set in motion a greatly increased number of semi-skilled and unskilled workers, above all women. This is in parta matter of moving skilled workers out of the less essential industries and services, or out of establishments in which they are being wastefully used to an exceptional extent. These parts of the problem are now being dealt with by theLabour Inspector and Labour Supply Committees, whose hands will be greatly strengthened when the new scheme of Industrial Registration of skilled workershas been carried into effect.This, however, is only a part of the problem; for transference does not of itself augment the labour suppty, though it can be used as a means of compellingfirms to press on with dilution, and may thus indirectly create considerableopenings for employment. It can be effective, if it is carefully applied, in bringing about a large amount of upgrading of semi-skilled workers to jobs pre-viously done by skilled men, either by simple replacement or by so dividing the jobs as to narrow the range of skill required. It is, however, most unlikelyof itself to bring about that fundamental revolution in workshop practices whichthe existing situation seems to demand.Such a revolution is necessary if we are to contemplate the prospect of at alla prolonged war. This prospect requires that Great Britain shall husband its financial resources for the purchase of essential raw materials and foodstuffsabroad, and shall produce at home the largest possible quantity of the mamr-factured products needed for war purposes or, secondarily, for export. This,however, cannot be done on the scale that is needed without a. tremendous
movement of unskilled labour into the essential industries a movement far inexcess of any that is likely to be brought about by the processes of dilution, asordinarily understood. Dilution and training are complementary problems; and.the restriction of ordinary consumers&apos; expenditure which is admittedly necessary under war conditions will speedily result in large-scale unemployment and waste of man-power, unless the question of training, as well as that of dilution, isenergetically taken in hand, on the basis of a comprehensive and diversifiedplan under unified administrative control.jy_The Structure of Industry in Peace and War.   (G.D.H.C.)In times of peace, decisions about production that is, about the use of plant,materials and man-power are made mainly by those responsible for the directionof individual firms. Where closely organised cartels or trade associations exist,these decisions may be governed by quota arrangements, or by other methodsof sharing out work among the members of the association. But even in thesecases, the quotas are usually maxima, and there are often arrangements forthe transference of quotas between firms; so that decisions as to the actualamounts to be produced still rest largely with the individual firms, subject to regulations designed to keep total production of all firms within the desiredmaximum amount.Thus, under normal conditions, the firm is the unit in respect of which theessential decisions are made. The firm may, of course, consist either of asingle plant or of many; and where one firm owns a number of establishmentsthe degree of independence accorded to each may vary within wide limits.Broadly, however, it can be said that the decisions taken about the quantityof production are in the same hands as the financial control of business enter-prise, and are dependent on considerations of profit. The firm aims at producingthe quantity of goods, and at employing the quantities of labour and other factors of production, that seem likely, all things taken into account, to yieldthe largest possible profit not necessarily in the short run, but after short and long run considerations have been weighed in the balance.The conditions of war-time production, at any rate in the essential industries,are, or should be, entirely different. For in war certain things must be pro-duced in very large amounts, not because firms find it profitable to produce them,but because they are needed in the national interest. Of these necessary goods,a large proportion is bought and used by the Government itself armaments,food for the armed services, and so on. A further large supply is boughtby &quot; Controls &quot; acting on behalf of the Government, and re-sold to industry or to traders for approved uses. In all these cases, the Government fixes theprices which it pays for the goods supplied, and the profit accruing to the producers as a result of the Governments price-fixing decisions. In some cases(eg. agricultural goods) the prices are fixed for the purpose of influencing theamounts produced, and to that extent the profit-motive remains in operation as a determinant of the quantity of output. But in most cases the Governmentwants as much to be produced as can be produced with the available plant and materials and supply of labour, without undue interference with other formsof production which require the services of the same factors. Wherever this isthe case, profits, even though they continue to exist, cease as act as determinantsof the volume of production and become mere controlled consequences of theGovernments policy.Moreover, in those branches of industry in which the Government is not themain purchaser of the output, the quantities produced in war-time also largelycease to be governed by profit-expectations, and come to be determined by theamounts of materials, plant or labour available. Plant and materials are diverted from normal production to war work, leaving less to be used in ordinary civiliantrades. Labour is similarly diverted; and any of these three factors, or all ofthem, may set a limit of output much below what would still be producedif profit were the determining factor. Of the three, the limitation of thesupply of materials is the most obvious in its operation, because the Govern-ment directly controls the supply of most of the essential materials of theindustry and can thus, by rationing, set absolute limits to the production ofany industry.   The plant factor operates plainly in industries where equipment
is readily convertible to war uses, but probably does not operate at all in other cases, where there is likely to be a considerable surplus of inconvertible plant.The labour factor operates in two ways first, through the transfer of skilled workers whose skill is adaptable to war work, and secondly through absoluteshortage of labour caused by the enlistments in the armed forces and by thetransfer of less skilled workers to the war trades, as openings for their employ-ment can be made through dilution or through the enlargement of the skilled labour supply by other means. This second process is, however, in most casesmuch slower than the first, as the absorption of less skilled workers in wartrades is governed by the available supplies of skilled or trained workers.Nevertheless, the profit motive remains in operation over a wide field, thoughit ceases to affect to any appreciable extent the quantities produced of thevarious types of goods. Where the total supplies of materials, and possibly oflabour, are restricted, some firms will be unable to carry on at a profit, andwill be compelled to close down, and their trade will be transferred to com-competitors who find themselves better able to adapt themselves to the changed conditions. In the less essential trades, the struggle to survive will in manycases become keener than in times of peace; and there will be a heavy mortalityof small businesses killed by the loss of normal markets and supplies. This pro-cess will be very haphazard, and will be certain to cause much suffering andto work very unfairly between one firm and another. The unfairness can beto some extent mitigated by rationing raw materials on the most equitablebasis that can be devised; but, where man-power is also scarce, the claims of equity may conflict seriously with those of economy in its use, for, the morebusinesses are kept alive, the smaller will be the release of labour (includingskilled labour) for more essential uses.In industries whose product is largely destined for use by the Governmentthe situation is somewhat different. The leading firms in such industries willlie working wholly or mainly to Government order or on other work regarded by the Government as essential (such as exports); and most of these firms willbe &quot;controlled establishments&quot; under the Ministry of Supply or one of thesupply departments. This, however, does not apply to the much more numerousfirms which are employed wholly or in part as sub-contractors. Most of thesefirms have no assurance that they will be kept fully and continuously employedon Government work. At the same time they will be endeavouring to securewar contracts and scrambling for a share of the remaining civilian trade in their normal types of production. Unlike the big firms engaged on main contracts,they will depend largely for their success in getting war work, as well as civilianorders, on the prices they are able to quote, as well as on the quality of theirworkmanship and their ability to offer fixed dates for delivery. The profitmotive will therefore remain important to them and the volume of output ofeach firm will tend to be determined not so much by its efficiency in doing aparticular job with the minimum use of scarce factors of production, such ashighly-skilled labour or machine tools of which there is a shortage, as on itsreadiness to take risks by quoting low prices to the main contractors, on itsknowledge of &quot; the ropes &quot; and its ability to establish effective contracts withthe firms likely to give out sub-contracts suitable to its plant and experience.As for the main contractors working directly for the Government, output isalmost entirely unaffected by questions of costs or prices; but profits are ofcourse very greatly affected thereby. Under the system of E.P.T. at 100 percent, this may seem not to matter; but in fact it matters a good deal, becausefirms which are in no danger of their profits falling below the pre-war standardare left without any incentive to economise, and indeed with every inducement to inflate costs not only by raising wages in order to retain or attract labour,but also by charging up renewals and improvements against current costs andin general by relaxing their efforts to keep costs down to a competitive level.In such a situation as has been described, there is a danger of getting the worst of both worlds. The competitive pressure, which is expected underordinary conditions to eliminate the unfit, works, broadly speaking, only in theless essential trades and among the smaller firms, and is apt in these cases towork both unfairly and almost at haphazard, eliminating not the unfit but the unfortunate and keeping a considerable amount of valuable plant and man-powerwastefully underemployed.   Upon the larger firms in the essential industries, oil
2the other hand, competitive pressure ceases to work at all; and in its absencethe normal incentives to efficiency disappear and are replaced only by the motive of patriotism which inevitably works much more effectively in afew great matters than in the host of details involved in the keeping down of factory costs. The consequence is apt to be wasteful production, in large firmsas well as in small ones, not merely in a financial sense, but in the much moreimportant sense that scarce real factors of labour and plant are not being put to the best possible use in the interests of the nation.For, under war conditions, the vital factor, in essential and non-essential industries alike, is not the financial, but the real cost of production that is,the amount of scarce factors of production that are being used up. It may bedesirable in wartime to make a commodity by methods which would be regardedas inefficient in time of peace where these methods though commercially lessproductive, can be applied by less scarce types of labour, operating less scarcetypes of machine. Even more evidently, it may be false economy to plan fora theoretically optimum scale of output where it is likely to be impossible, whenthe plant is ready, to get the large force of labour, especially skilled labour,necessary for its efficient working.These considerations suggest that the attempt to conduct a war economyon a basis which leaves1 practically intact the separate existence of each firm,as it existed in time of peace, has serious drawbacks. The Government, throughthe various supply departments, continues to deal with each firm as a distinctunit; and indeed each supply department may be dealing independently withthe same firm in respect of its own contracts. The main contractors, in their turn, deal independently with a host of sub-contractors, who may have relationswith a number of different contractors. Throughout, the firm remains the unit, except where a particular industry is so closely concentrated that the cartelor trade association in effect deals with the Government as a united body whichis apt to mean that Government control is ineffective, and that the leadingfirms in the trade in fact control both themselves and the smaller firms whichdepend on them.The only other exception is where the small producers themselves form some sort of combine for the purpose of securing contracts or sub-contracts and dis-tributing them over the members of the group. Organisation of this kind seemsto have been exceptional so far during the present war, though not unknown.Its possibilities have been in part explored in another memorandum (I. ContractPolicy).Leaving these exceptions aside, we find that the policy of the supply depart-ments has been based hitherto on separate dealings with each large individualfirm or business unit, and with some small firms, whereas other small firms have been left to be dealt with by way of sub-contract or even sub-sub-contractmade practically without Government supervision or control. The first question that arises is whether this method of handling the larger firms is the most efficient that could be designed.From the standpoint of man-power, it has clearly very great disadvantages.In all the main centres of munition-making, but above all in Coventry and birmingham and certain parts of Lancashire, the shortage of skilled labour isacute. It would be very much easier to put the available labour to the best use if the entire skilled labour force in an area could be regarded as forming a single pool, available for transfer at any time to the point at which the needfor it seemed most urgent. It is true that machinery does now exist for com-pulsory or voluntary transfers of labour on the basis of reports made by theLabour Supply Inspectors or on the direct authority of the Divisional Con-trollers of the Ministry of Labour. But this form of transference is cumbrousand not easy to apply on a large scale; and transfers made under it are usuallydesigned to be permanent. This is a very different thing from treating all thelabour in an area as forming a pool so that key men could be ordered to go toa particular factory for a few days or weeks only without any formal change ofemployer, or alternatively work from an overloaded department of one factorycould be sent without formal sub-contract to another factory where skilled labour and suitable machinery could be made available for immediate use.It is recognised that there would be difficulties in the way of this policy,on the managerial as well as on the financial side.   But it seems clear that the
administrative difficulties would not be insuperable if the financial problemscould be solved. Indeed, the one solution would to a great extent carry with itthe other. If the firm were not working, in war as in peace, as a distinct profit-making unit, problems of distributing costs between two firms co-operating inthis way would be unimportant and the management, no longer regarding itself as the servant of a particular board of directors or body of shareholders, wouldbe able to adopt a different attitude towards schemes of collaboration with itsrivals in the same trade.There is only one effective way of breaking down the barriers between firms which still stand in the way of thorough co-operation in the war effort. Thisis to remove entirely, for the period of the war, all connection between productionand profits, and to make each establishment definitely part of a public wartimeservice. A brief outline of a method by which this could be done is addedas an appendix to this memorandum; but clearly there are many alternativeways in which the general principle could be applied, and it might be desirableto use somewhat different methods in dealing with different types of undertaking.What matters is, first, that both the managerial and technical staffs and theworkers employed shall cease, for the period of the war, to regard themselves as the servants of a particular business, and shall feel themselves to be as muchin the service of the State as those enrolled in the armed forces, and, secondly,that it shall become possible to re-group units, to arrange for co-operation betweenplants, and to transfer labour or work either temporarily or permanently with-out running up against endless difficulties arising out of the differing financial conditions of the separate firms or the divided loyalties of those employed in them.One very great advantage of the pooling of industrial capacity here suggestedis that it would make possible a coherent wage-policy. Under existing con-ditions, one of the greatest difficulties involved in the transfer of labour fromfirm to firm arises out of the differences of wage-conditions and earnings, even where wage-rates are nominally standardised over a whole district. difficulties are of course even greater where transfer involves migration from a high-wageto a low-wage area; but this is a distinct problem which could, however, bemuch more easily dealt with if there were some coherence in the wage-structurewithin each district. Given a pooling of the firms in an area (say, Coventryor Birmingham) under unified State control, it would become possible to introducemuch greater uniformity of wage-payments and conditions, and thus to avoidmany of the awkward questions which now arise when labour has to be trans-ferred from firm to firm (see Memorandum K for a consideration of these difficulties).The importance of introducing more coherence into wage policy can hardly be overestimated. Wage-raSes are no doubt regulated for the most part in each district by collective agreements, which prevent serious anomalies from arising,except where labour has to be transferred from one district to another; andmany agreements also make provision for the regulation of piece-work prices.This, however, does not suffice to prevent serious inequalities, both becauseof the very uneven incidence of overtime and week-end earnings, and becausepiece-work prices fixed under different conditions from those now prevailingmay work out so as to yield much higher earnings to some groups of menthan to others of equal or greater skill. Merit bonuses, designed to correctanomalies of this kind, can also become abuses when they are used to attractor retain men by the offer of abnormally high earnings. As long as earningsfor similar work are allowed to vary widely from firm to firm it will be impossibleto prevent a sense of grievance from developing wherever workers know thatwage-conditions are better elsewhere than in the establishments in which theyare employed; and these grievances will be felt most keenly in cases of com-pulsory transfer which involves a reduction in earnings, even if the lower ratecan be regarded as reasonable in itself. This is not, for the most part, becausethe workers wish to profiteer at the national expense, but because it is naturalfor men or women to feel themselves unfairly treated when they are faringworse than others who are doing similar work near at hand.The attitude of the workers is, moreover, very much affected by what they believe about the treatment meted out by the Government to other classes.A national wage policy would be accepted much more readily if it were accom-
5ioanied by measures fixing salaries for managers and supervisory workers and making them direct servants of the State, and if in addition &quot; capital &quot; alsowere put on a fixed salary for the duration of the war. It may be argued thatthis is precisely the effect which E.P.T. at 100 per cent, is meant to have; butthe answer is that this is not its effect in practice, nor is this believed to be its effect by the great majority of people. As long as companies continue to declare varying dividends and profits based on their war work, the great majorityof the workers will continue to believe that the profit system is still fully inoperation.Besides its effect in making practicable a more rational wage policy, the taking over by the State of the principal establishments engaged in war production would make much easier the mobilisation of the smaller firms and of factories in less essential industries which are suitable for adaptation to war uses. Forhaphazard arrangements between individual main contractors and small firmsit would become possible to substitute a rational system of planning, wherebyeach sub-contractor would be enabled to work continuously either for a singlelarger firm, or for a number of firms requiring supplies of a single type ofcomponent. This would tend to a much better use of the facilities available inthe smaller firms, which are often now underused or dissipated on account of the lack of continuity in the placing of sub-contracts, or of placing without due regard to the productive capacity of the firms concerned. In some xases, it mightbe desirable for the State to take over completely important firms regularlyengaged in work on sub-contract (e.g. for the Ministry of Aircraft Production).Whether or not this should be done would be a matter for decision in each individual case; but the benefit of more rational distribution of contracts would extend not only to firms brought directly under Government control, but alsoto other sub-contractors, who would be enabled to deal with a single orderingauthority in each area, instead of having to canvass for orders among a host of independent main contractors scattered over the whole country.The disadvantages of the existing methods of allocating contracts and sub-contracts have been set out in another memorandum in this series (I. ContractPolicy). The&apos;conditions therein described, as well as the anomalies of wage-payment under the existing system (see Memorandum K) and the notoriouslyunsatisfactory working of E.P.T., are ample enough to call for a radical recon-sideration of the entire basis of the existing forms of State control.The fundamental weakness of these forms of control is to be found in the attempt to preserve the pre-war business structure, even when the incentives to action and the checks on inefficiency which enabled the system towork economically under peace conditions have been in the main removed.In wartime, the profit motive is out of place as a stimulus to production; for it is necessary to increase output in some directions and to reduce it in others,irrespective of the effects of either increase or reduction on the prospects ofbusiness profit. The profit motive therefore remains in operation as for themost part an irrelevant intruder into the system of wartime planning; and its effect is rather to impede the efficient planning of output, especially in the caseof the smaller firms, than to make any real contribution to economy in thearrangement of productive processes or in the use of the scarce factors ofproduction.Indeed, the only rational case that can be advanced in favour of the retentionof the existing system of control is that it exists, and that it is undesirable tomake drastic changes in it at a time when short-run considerations are naturallyforemost in people&apos;s minds. This consideration can, however, be dismissed asunworthy of attention, if it can be shown that the change is necessary in orderto maximise the war effort. As for the view that it is undesirable to make changes now, even if they can be shown to be expedient in principle, on accountof the danger of dislocation during the transition, it can be shown that no dis-location need in fact occur. If the principal contractors were taken over, thereneed be no interruption at all of contracts already planned, except where aredistribution could be shown to be desirable, or a closer relation could be made between orders received and capacity to execute them by a given date. Norneed there be any disturbance of existing sub-contracts, except for the samereasons.    All that would happen would be that future contracts and sub-
contracts would be more rationally allocated, and that there would be muchmore pooling of work between firms and much more interchange both of skilled labour, and, where necessary, of machinery also. The tasks of the various&quot; Controls &quot; responsible for the allocation of scarce materials and instruments of production would also be immensely simplified, if war industry as a whole were organised so as to work in accordance with a regular plan of continuousand highly-specialised production.Against such a reorganisation what argument is there, beyond a largely irrationalhostility to &quot; State interference &quot;? However industry is organised in wartime, the State is bound to interfere at almost every point. It is bound to ration scarce materials, to license imports, to control the supply of new buildings and machinery, to regulate prices, and to prevent the acquisition of abnormalprofits, at any rate beyond a limited amount. The chief danger is that theseforms of State control will be merely superimposed upon the pre-war industrial structure without due recognition of the fact that their presence is bound torender inoperative the pre-war incentives to efficiency, and to cause the units ofprivate business control to behave in very different ways for example, in respectof wage policy and of the choice-between alternative methods of production.The view advanced in this memorandum is that, from the standpoint of the most efficient utilisation of the available man-power under war-conditions, direct Stateemployment would be greatly preferable to the existing hybrid arrangement,above all because it would (a) break down the barriers between firms, and thusmake possible a better pooling of resources, and (6) lay the foundations for acoherent wage policy, which is indispensable to any extensive scheme for thetransfer of labour in large quantities either from occupation to occupation or fromdistrict to district.Appendix.Provisional Heads for taking over Establishments.i. Every main contractor, whose establishment or establishments have, duringthe three months preceding the date of the order, been engaged on government work in respect of 50 per cent, or more of the total output of the establishment,shall, from the date of the order, place his establishment or establishmentsentirely at the disposal of the Government.2. From the date of the order, every worker in the establishment shall receive a wage or salary from the Government, and no payment of wages or salariesshall be made, except in accordance with a rate approved by the appropriateGovernment department.3. From the dat.. of the order, all balances standing to the credit of the com-pany or firm owning che establishment shall be transferred to Government account,and all outstanding debts in respect of materials supplied to the establishmentshall be similarly transferred. The necessary adjustments in respect of suchdebts and credits shall be made by the department concerned, subject to appealto the tribunal hereinafter mentioned.4. Where an establishment taken over under the order forms part of a business or firm including establishments not so taken over, the necessary adjustmentsshall be made by the department concerned, subject to appeal to the tribunalhereinafter mentioned.5.

III.   SUMMARY OF SUBSIDIARY MEMORANDAE. Labour Reserves in Less Essential and Declining Trades (J.F.G.).(i) Labour reserves in industries not mainly engaged in war production are considered from two points of view: to discover (i) what reserves of labourcould be withdrawn from these trades if they were needed, (2) what reserves of labour already exist as surpluses in declining industries.(2) Needs of new war factories make the first consideration important inthe North-Western, Midlands, and Wales Divisions. The decline of civiliantrade and foreign export and limited supplies of materials make the secondimportant in the London, Eastern, North Midlands, and Scotland Divisions.Other Divisions involve both considerations.(3) The distributive, clothing, textiles, furnishing and other woodworking,printing and paper manufacturing, hotel and catering, chocolate and sugarconfectionery trades would provide a source of labour in all or a great numberof the Divisions. The withdrawal of large numbers from these trades (e.g.,the distributive) would in most cases require a carefully considered reorganisation -sation of the industry to protect the interests of the public and the smallowner.(4) There are developing surpluses of labour in such declining trades ashosiery, ladies&apos; garment and lace making, textile, clothing, boot and shoe,woodworking and furnishings, carpeting, printing and paper, box-making, hoteland catering, docks, tobacco, sections of the building, pottery, and chocolateand sugar confectionery trades in, among others, the London, Leicester,Nottingham, Norwich, Northampton, and Dundee areas.(5) The Limitation of Supplies Order, market factors, and shortage of rawmaterials have produced these surpluses in localities where there is little alter-native employment. There should be no official restriction of production inthese trades unless employment opportunities exist or unless there is anunavoidable shortage of materials.(6) Section (2) of the memorandum consists of a detailed report of the posi-tion in selected trades and localities in each of the eleven Divisions.F. Location of Industry in War.   (G.D.H.C.)(1) In view of the great difficulties of moving large bodies of workers fromone district to another and of keeping them in the district to which they havebeen transferred new factories and extensions should be placed with special regard to labour supply, i.e. so as to reduce transfer and travelling to a minimum.(2) In view of this it is remarkable that apparently even to-day the state has no control at all over the location of new factories for war work by private employers. In the case of the Supply Departments, particularly the Ministryof Supply and the Admiralty, there have been arrangements for systematicconsultation between these Departments and the Ministry of Labour as tolocation of new factories, but these consultations have not always led to suitable placing of the factory with regard to labour conditions.(3) A list of factories or extensions where special labour supply difficulties have arisen or are anticipated (given in an appendix to the memorandum) showsthat out of 22 such cases there were five cases (mainly those of private firms) onwhich the Ministry of Labour was not consulted at all, and eight cases in whichobjections made by the Ministry of Labour to the proposed location wereoverruled.(4) In some cases the difficulty of labour supply arose not through the choice of the general region in which the factory is situated, but through the choice of site and the size and layout of the factory.(5) The history of the Ministry of Labour&apos;s efforts to bring new factories to areas of heavy unemployment is a story of conflict between two ideas: (a) thatof placing the factory where the greatest number of workers to be used (mainly
unskilled) would be found and importing the smaller number of highly skilled men, and (b) that of placing the factory where highly skilled men were to befound (if they could be drawn from their present employment) and trusting tothe unskilled labour coming along and being housed somehow. The former plan was favoured by the Ministry of Labour, the latter as a rule by the supply departments and the employers. Occasionally a third plan, of removing thefactory into a country district remote from both kinds of labour and possibilitiesof poaching by other employers was adopted; this plan has least to commend it.q_Restriction of Unessential Trades.    (g.d.h.c.)(l) The desire to do war work is widespread, and it is not enough recognisedthat the character of war work to-day offers fewer openings for unskilled workersthan were available in the last war. This makes it difficult to transfer quicklylarge numbers of workers from ordinary civilian occupations; and this means that dissatisfaction arises when volunteers for war work find that their services are not at present needed.(2) The possibility of recruiting large bodies of less skilled workers for munitions work depends on the progress made with dilution and the trainingof workers for skilled jobs. This means that extreme restriction of the ordinaryconsumers&apos; trades may result in large-scale unemployment if! it is carried throughbefore the war trades are ready to absorb the workers who are thrown out oftheir regular jobs. It cannot be economical to throw workers out of work whenthey cannot be absorbed in more useful employment, unless this is made necessary by shortages of raw materials. To keep people in employment is an important contribution to the maintenance of the nation&apos;s morale.(3) The consumers&apos; trades must, however, be compelled to release by sub-stitution of less skilled and older workers as much as possible of the skilled labour that is needed for more urgent work. Subject to this, care must be taken not so to contract the consumers&apos; trades as unnecessarily to cause wholesale ruinof small businesses, or to bring about mass-unemployment in certain parts ofthe country-notably London, the Eastern Midlands, and East Scotland.(4) There are great difficulties in the way of mass transference of labour outof these areas, and accordingly it is desirable to place a larger proportion ofwar contracts in of near places in which the restrictions on consumers&apos; tradesare likely to create big surpluses of labour.(5) The existing regional allocation of war orders is examined in the light ofthis principle, and serious discrepancies are revealed. The Midland area, which contains 10 per cent, of the insured workers, is shown to account for over 20 percent, of the prospective demand for labour, whereas the London region, with21 per cent, of the insured workers accounts for only 14 per cent, of the prospective labour demand. Similar disproportions are revealed elsewhere, andthe conclusion is drawn that in view of the extreme and increasing difficulties involved in a policy of mass-migration of workers to new centres of employment,a determined effort should be made before it is too late, to readjust contractpolicy so as to place contracts with more regard to the supplies of labour locallyavailable, and to avoid the construction of new factories, or large extensions ofexisting factories, in places in which either there is already an acute shortageof local labour and no means of bringing labour from relatively near at hand, orof accommodating it when it has been brought .... The utmost possibleeffort should be made to use all usable labour near the present homes of theworkers, to adapt existing factories in these areas, wherever possible, insteadof building new factories elsewhere, and to invoke the help of employers and workers in the threatened areas in working out plans of collective adaptationin co-operation with the supply departments. Otherwise, total output will bemuch smaller than it could be; and grave damage will be done to the spiritof the people both by the creation of unmanageable congestion in some areas and, in others, by the frustration of the will to service.(6) To the extent to which supplies of materials can be made available, it ishad policy, from the standpoint of war finance and of the effects on the spiritol the people, to close down or restrict the. consumers&apos; trades any faster thanemployment can effectively be found in more essential industries for the workersdisplaced. .....
H. Conversion of Vacant and Under-Used Plant.   (J.F.G.)(i) The decline of certain non-essential trades has produced a vast amount otredundant plant of all kinds and sizes throughout the country.(2) Because of the shortage of building labour and material to construct new works, the problems of housing and transporting workers in declining tradeselsewhere, and the desirability of maintaining so far as possible existing personnelunits, an extensive effort to convert premises now redundant or rapidly becomingredundant to war work is recommended.(3) It would be the business of Departments concerned to weigh in evervcase the advantages of altering and re-equipping existing plant against those of constructing new plant altogether. To make effective use of small factories and workshops, co-operative associations with pooling arrangements (discussed insubsidiary memorandum I) would be necessary.(4) The hosiery trade of Leicester and Nottingham and the jute trade ofDundee are instances of large declining industries where a considerable amountof under-used factory space is becoming available. London has the largest number of premises and stands in the greatest need of a programme of con-versions. These firms, most of which are small, include wood-working, metal-working, wire-working and small engineering and machine shops which could be turned to press tool and metal and assembly work.(5) The appendices consist of reports of vacant premises to be found throughoutthe country. For London there is a sample detailed list of firms, giving their size, present work, and suggested types of work.I.- Contract Policy.   (G.D.H.C.)Under this heading three separate memoranda are included, one on sub-contract policy drawn up before the final reports of the local investigators hadbeen received, and two later memoranda on contract policy and on priority policy.All three are prefaced by a statement of the conditions under which the variouscomplaints made to the local investigators were received and reported by them.The investigators were instructed not to report complaints which appeared to haveno real substance, but it was impossible for them in the time available to seekindependent verification in each case. Some of the complaints reported may therefore be ill-founded but it is of value to those concerned with organisingproduction to know of all grievances, since even ill-founded grievances maydelay production until the answer to them is given.(i) Sub-Contract Policy (30th July, 1940).Attention is drawn to the misuse, or under-use, of the man-power availablein relatively small firms owing to defects in contract and sub-contract policy.It is pointed out that for such firms continuous specialisation on a narrow range of products is indispensable if low real costs are to be obtained, and if scarcetypes of skilled labour are not to be wasted in unnecessary making of tools andjigs-The following recommendations are put forward :  (1) Wherever possible, firms now not mainly engaged on direct contracts for the supply departments (especially small firms, but not excluding largerfirms normally engaged on non-essential work) should be encouraged toform pools or associations with which the supply departments could makedirect contacts. The firms joining such associations could then arrange to share out the work, each firm specialising on a single part or group ofprocesses. The associations should be of such a nature as to be able tomake firm contracts on behalf of their members.(2) Contracts with associations of the type mentioned should be made 011a basis which will allow continuous production, and provide for long termspecialisation and adaptation of plant and labour with an adequate assurance of continuous orders.
(3) Re-tendering should be eliminated wherever possible, either by fixingorders well ahead on a fixed price basis, or by taking over the concernson a basis of fixed wages and salaries, plus fixed fees for plant and equip-ment for the duration of the contract.(4) The scheme should include provision for the concentration of plantin the establishments in which it can be most effectively used, and forthe pooling of the supply of labour, especially skilled labour, between the firms joining the associations.(5) Consideration should be given in the case of the smaller establishmentsto the possibility of pooling maintenance and repair staffs in order to spread the supply of skilled workers more thinly over the firms concerned.(6) There seems to be need for local and regional officers authorised tonegotiate collective arrangements of this type on behalf of the supply depart-ments, and for close contact between these officers and the local and regional organisations of the Ministry of Labour.(7) In view of the shortage of building labour and materials and the inevitable delay before newly constructed factories can begin full production,there seems to be a very strong case, for using, wherever possible, existingfactories and factory space. This is likely to be achieved to the best advantage by local pooling arrangements on the lines suggested above.(8) In certain cases, it will be desirable to establish assembly factories,either under direct government control, or within the proposed associations,to assemble the products of factories and workshops included in groupschemes. In other cases, assembly could be undertaken by the proposedassociations or by main contractors. It would be best for the associationsthemselves to undertake most of the assembly, except where parts have tobe made in different districts. In any case, the fullest possible use shouldbe made of existing factory space, in order both to reduce the demand forconstructional labour and materials and to employ workers as near theirown homes as possible, and thus reduce the necessity for long distancemigration or for travel which is bound to impair efficiency during working hours.(9) In view of the large amount of factory space and equipment and oflabour which it will be difficult to move, available in Greater London andin districts regarded as vulnerable, it seems desirable to reconsider the policyof placing as few contracts as possible in such areas, especially as these areas include large numbers of small firms eminently suitable for poolarrangements of the type proposed.(ii) Contract Policy (nth September, 1940).The opening stages of the war were fought on the principle of &quot; business as Usual.&quot; This involved a desire to interfere as little as possible with theorganisation of existing firms, and to use existing Trade Associations as far aspossible as agents in operating the various &quot; Controls.&quot; It also led to a policyof placing the expanding volume of contracts as far as possible with existing government contractors, with the consequence that there was too much sub-contracting and sub-sub-contracting. Moreover, the choice of sub-contractorswas largely haphazard, and most small and even some large firms had to spendtoo much time and energy in hunting out main contractors who could give themwork. This competition for sub-contracts did not in fact reduce prices for theGovernment because it resulted in great waste of labour, especially of highly skilled types, and in discontinuous production.The memorandum summarises the criticisms of contract policy made by thelocal Man-Power investigators as follows:  (1) Sub-contracts are too discontinuous and too small to keep most firmsregularly employed.(2) The placing of contracts is haphazard and unfair as between firm andfirm, and tends to leave much valuable plant and man-power inadequatelyused. This occurs especially in the case of the smaller firms, among whomjoint action has been much too little encouraged.(3) Discontinuity leads to the retention of skilled workers whom a policyof continuity would release for other essential work.
(4) Tendering and re-tendering are criticised as wrong policies under war conditions; and it is alleged that too little time is often allowed for tenderingand that specifications are often unnecessarily rigid, and delivery datesinsisted on with too little relation to the difficulties about supplies of rawmaterials and sub-contracted parts.(5) It is alleged that the supply departments are too slow in dealing withoffers of work, and that inspection is often too much governed by routinemethods which take no account of the emergency. There are also complaints about cancellation of orders after tools and jigs have been made; but itis recognised that these may have been due to unavoidable changes of design.(6) Attention is drawn to the ignorance of small firms about the pro-cedure needed for getting contracts, and to the widespread belief thatsuccess demands the employment of lobbying agents in London. there seemed also to be a fear that, if the complainants made their grievances&apos;oiown, they might be boycotted for future contracts.(7) In general, complaints concerning the supply of materials were notiso numerous as had been expected; but there was a widespread desire tobe allowed to hold small stocks in reserve, instead of having to secure eventhe smallest supplies in connection with each particular contract.(8) Stress was laid on the need so to place building contracts as to keepin existence local firms whose services would be needed in repairing air-raid damage.(9) The desirability of placing a large proportion of contracts with fairlysmall firms was emphasised as a precaution against the possible con-sequences of intensive air attack.(10) It was urged that consideration should again be given to the use ofdockyards and ship-repairing centres for munitions production at times when their man-power was not fully needed for their regular work.(11) Finally, it was urged that greater attention should be paid to; relatingthe placing of contracts to the industrial capacity of the contracting firms,in order to avoid both under use of available capacity and excessive pilingup of sub-contracts.(iii) Priority Policy in Relation to Labour Supply.Priority for one thing over another cannot be absolute; it must be a matterof relative quantities of different kinds of goods.The system of priorities should be uniforrm for all factors, e.g., a firm enjoying,in respect of materials, a certain priority for a particular contract should, as faras is practicable, enjoy a corresponding priority in respect of the supply of machine tools, or of labour.There should be, under the Production Council of the Cabinet, parallel butclosely co-operating bodies dealing with the various factors relevant to a correctdetermination of priorities materials, industrial capacity (including buildingcapacity) and labour supply. ,J. The Problem of Moving Labour.   (G.R.M.)(1) There are two sides to the problem of moving labour the worker&apos;s resist-ance to transfer and the inadequacy of lodging and travel accommodation inthe locality to which he is to be transferred.(2) Unless the worker&apos;s entire family can be moved, and this is a practicalimpossibility in large scale transfers, the worker is bound to keep two establish-ments going. He objects to this partly on financial grounds and partly because it interrupts family life. Homesickness is the cause of many &quot; desertions &quot;among transferred workmen.(3) In certain cases, e.g., in London, workers resist transfer because they are strongly attached to the life of the locality.(4) Other objections to transfer are difference in rates of pay for the same or similar types of work in various localities (especially, in the skilled grades), thesubsistence allowance, absence of guarantees of re-instatement, and possible lossof pension rights.
fs) In the Birmingham-Coventry area, there are already acute problems of housing, lodging, and travel accommodation. In an area lying north-west of theindustrial West Midlands and stretching through Lancashire to the West Ridingof Yorkshire, the bulk of new war factories are being constructed. The evidence is that the same problems are bound to arise there.(6) The magnitude of these difficulties has not been foreseen and the facilities to meet them are even now inadequate. There should be a co-ordinatingauthority in the principal localities large enough to undertake the two problemsof housing and transport and solve them connectedly. Most local authoritiescover too small an area; nor are they in a position to consider rail and road transport on the scale required.(7) The problem would be eased by bringing the work to the workers.Facilities for daily travel have broken down in a great many cases, but this problem is more easily managed than that of housing. It is clear that workpeople(married women excepted) prefer a large amount of daily travel to transfer toa new locality.K._Wage Difficulties and the Transfer of Labour.   (G.J.W.)(1) Obstacles to the smooth transfer of labour arising from regional and occu-national differences of earnings fall under four main heads:  (i) Skilled men from &quot; non-essential &quot; trades can only be accepted in theengineering trades at lower rates of pay as trainees or unskilled workers.(ii) Firms in civilian trades, or firms only partly occupied on government work are finding difficulty in retaining essential labour against the attractionof the larger wages to be earned working systematic overtime, night work,and week-ends, in the plants of controlled establishments or successfultenderers.(iii) Subsistence allowances are paid to married men transferred underofficial schemes since January 1st, 1940. This discriminates against thosetransferred before that date; those moving on their own initiative, andsingle men.(iv) In the case of London, hindrance to transfer is greatest. Londonwages are higher than in the Provinces and so are rents; and the proportionof unemployed craftsmen is high.(2) Some of these impediments can be removed by minor adjustments re-arrangement of rates of subsistence, payment of rent allowances to Londoners,and the revision of contract policy. But the re-employment of highly paidcraftsmen as unskilled or semi-skilled engineering workers raises a major issue of wage policy.L. Hours, Shifts, and Conditions of Work.    (W.H.T. and G.J.W.)(1) A fair amount of overtime is being worked because there is a shortageof skilled labour. The shortage of skilled workers is preventing the establishmentof three eight-hour shifts. Some firms cannot work a double shift. Others havea very small night shift. Several arms factories, especially in the Birminghamarea, could employ thousands of additional workers if they could get small numbers of skilled workers.(2) Some employers are offering overtime in order to retain their workmenand /or to attract new workers. Under the &quot; cost plus &quot; percentage system thereis no incentive for employers to cut costs, and some employers are keeping menidle during working hours and overtime. So long as employers could inflatetheir wages-bill at the expense of the Government they were not unduly worriedat their inability to find the men anything to do. Some firms are offeringovertime to attract workers.(3) There is strong opposition from employers and trade unions to week-endworkers. Employers maintain that the spasmodically trained, inferior, and un-disciplined worker would be expensive and rising &quot; overheads &quot; would be accom-panied by falling output. Trade union officials assert that if &quot; outsiders &quot;received the special rate of pay there would be endless friction and discontent.There would be more accidents, spoilt work, and broken machinery, and week-end
work also imposes extra strain on skilled workers. Week-end work requires tactand shrewd organisation. Position under factory acts, and stamping of cardsneeds clarifying.(4) The effects of long hours are rising sickness, accidents and absenteeismrates. Absenteeism is strongest among married women. Men take a day off to get a rest. Enthusiasm for long hours has weakened and firms are, returning to a shorter working day.(5) Heavy strain placed on transport facilities and the waste of workpeople&apos;s time could be minimised if factory hours were staggered. Position is worst in birmingham where companies are short of &quot;buses and drivers owing to demandsof military authorities and where firms are returning to a two-shift system.M. Substitute Employment of Women.   (G.J.W.)(i) Women are required in increasing numbers both to provide for expansionof munitions output, and to take the place of men withdrawn from munitiontrades.(2) Dilution through the employment of women has hardly begun. In mostareas, progress still lags behind that achieved in the last war.(3) Resistance arises from the lack of imagination of employers, more than from the obstruction of the men.(4) The major impediment to transfer is geographical. Women are being released by the contraction of civilian trades, or are available, though unoccupied,in Divisions such as the North Midlands, the Northern and Wales. The factories and the demand for their services are in other Divisions, such as the Midlands.(5) Even where factories have been erected in regions having (or expecting)a surplus of women, as in the North-Western and North-Eastern Divisions,difficulties of access to plants impede the complete absorption of the availablefemale labour.(6) Expansion of factory employment among married women demands some provision for relieving them of the burden of household duties and family cares.Day nurseries are an urgent need, communal feeding must be undertaken andso on.(7) The pool of women available for employment is steadily rising. To make,use of this source of man-power, more attention must be given to the labour situation in the location of new factories. The women must otherwise be moved into the towns and regions where they are wanted.(8) There are many obstacles retarding the full movement of women. Marriedwomen cannot be shifted.(9) To make migration of single women a success, great attention must bepaid to the welfare of the women in the reception area.(10) Welfare cannot be confined to the factory. A reasonable standard of com-fort in living quarters must be assured, and some provision made for their livesoutside the factory. Otherwise the incidence of nostalgia may defeat attempts to move the population.(ii) In some cases, girls&apos; incomes may have to be made up to an adequate sum.N. Training Allowances.   (G.J.W.)(1) Men and women undergoing training are being paid at different rates.(2) Rates in Government Training Centres were till recently determined byscales of unemployment benefit. These allowances were adequate so long as thetrainees normally were persons wholly unemployed.(3) Pay at this rate (even after the recent increase) is insufficient to inducemen from other trades, particularly highly paid craftsmen, to undergo training as engineers, or to tempt semi-skilled men already in engineering to give up piecework to train for skilled jobs. Even unemployed London craftsmen are better offon benefit than as trainees, since statutory benefit is supplemented by Union pay.(4) The scope of payment should be extended to include all persons receivinginstruction under approved schemes.
(e) Allowances cannot compensate for all that a man, skilled or experienced inone trade, risks when volunteering for training as ah engineer, but a scale of pay more generous than unemployment benefit is indicated. Firms organising train-ing schemes themselves usually pay the minimum day wages.q_Mines and Quarries.   (W.H.T.)(i) By February, 1940, the workers employed in the whole of the ironstoneindustry had fallen to 8,587 compared with the pre-war total of 9,594. Workersincluding &quot; key-men &quot; have been lost to. (a) armed forces, (b) A.R.P., (c) public and government contract works, other better paid jobs. Two sources of supply,i e , agricultural workers and Irishmen have dried up. Rate of output has risen from 14 million tons (pre-war) to 17J million tons. This is explained by increasedmechanisation, the working of overtime, and sacrificing holidays. Rising sickness and absenteeism rates are expected to get worse in the winter. The Clevelanddistrict requires 1,000 men almost immediately, and the Leicester and North-ampton district, 300. It is proposed that (1) all ironstone miners in the armed forces should be released, (2) the industry should be &quot; protected,&quot; (3) unemployedDurham coal-miners should be transferred to the Cleveland iron-ore mines,(4) local committees should settle the problem of wages and conditions for the transferred workers. It may be necessary to guarantee weekly wages till the menare proficient enough to go on piece work; guarantee work for several months or for the duration, and turn large empty houses into fiats and build temporaryhutments.(2) The Durham coalfield and the Welsh Anthracite district have been badlyhit by the loss of markets. Unemployment is rising. There appears little likelihood-hood of any improvement. The South Yorkshire coalfield could employ afurther 1,200 men and boys and the Nottingham coalfield a further 600-700.(3) The labour force of the Cornish Tin/ and Wolfram mines has been depletedby (a) calling up reservists, [b) workers moving to defence works and govern-ment jobs to ea,rn better wages. Wages are low. It is proposed that all thetin miners should be placed on the list of reserved occupations and some of the older unemployed miners, as in the last war, should be employed. This requiressome arrangement between the government and the assurance companies to cover the risk of employing men slightly affected by silicosis.P. Openings for Labour on the Land.    (A.M.)(1) In spite of increased activity in the past year there has been little generaldemand for agricultural labour, although there are instances of local demand for skilled workers. The employment of additional unskilled workers has been negligence-gible and the Women&apos;s Land Army has been comparatively little used.(2) At the same time, many farms have long been and still are badly under-staffed and underworked. There is scope for the employment of at least 100,000workers on the improvement of existing farms by ditching, draining, hedging,the repair of buildings and roads, etc.(3) There are also more than, 1,000,000 acres of idle but potentially productiveland which have been lost to crops and grass since 1920 but could be brought back into cultivation even within the next two years by draining, ditching,clearing and so forth.(4) Many farmers are unwilling to incur the costs involved in improving their land, but without improvement the vicious circle of underfarming, decreasingreturns and further underfarming cannot be broken. Much less are farmers pre-pared to bear the cost of reclaiming land at present derelict.(5) Nor is it suggested are County War Agricultural Executive Committeesgenerally suitable bodies to undertake large scale reclamation of land; they are fully occupied with their present duties.(6) The State should set up a &quot; Land Reclamation Commission &quot; to employmobile gangs of workers on land reclamation in every part of the country.(7) In addition, directions should be issued to farmers ordering them to carryout all important improvements to their land. The Commission could use itspools of labour to do the work, on credit if necessary, payment being made by farmers on a rising scale of instalments over a period of years.
(8) Unskilled workers under skilled supervision have been proved equal to allagricultural operations. Some classes of person can hardly be given employmentexcept by means of a State agricultural scheme. There is wide-spread agreement among agriculturists on the need for a scheme of this nature, and on the useunder it of such persons of the 16-20 age group as are at present inadequatelyoccupied.(9) Market garden production could and should be greatly increased both in rural and urban areas. A large number of unskilled workers could be used underskilled supervision to effect the increase.(10) An efficient distributive organisation is essential to any development of market gardening. A &quot; Home Produce Distribution Board &quot; would solve these difficulties and could also deal with the produce of land farmed by a LandReclamation Commission.(n) Not less than 3,000 workers are required by the Catchment and LocalDrainage Boards for both large and small scale drainage work in England, andmany more are wanted for drainage work in Scotland.(12) The Forestry Commission also requires at least 8,000 workers for timberfelling, hauling, and processing, and for clearing and re-afforestation.(13) Serious problems of accommodation must be met in providing for labour on the land, but this can be done by billeting, taking over empty houses, repair-ing dilapidated buildings and erecting sectional huts.(14) Energetic and imaginative action by the State is not only essential to thewar effort but would be of lasting benefit to British agriculture.Q.-Youth Labour Service.    (W.H.B. and G.D.H.C.)(1) The case for a Youth Labour Service rests on two grounds: (1) theabsence of opportunity to serve the nation among young people of military again blind-alley and non-essential employment, those pursuing higher education,those whom employers are reluctant to employ because of prospective calling-up,and those unfit for military service, (2) the bad effect on national morale whichfailure to bring young people into the war effort produces.(2) The Service should be constituted on independent lines with a NationalCommissioner for Youth whose office would have close relations with thelabour, education, health, agriculture, and Scottish departments.(3) Schools, training colleges, youth organisations, and Employment Exchangeswould be used for recruiting for the Service. The terms of service for full-time members would be for one year, the member agreeing to go anywhere to any work as directed. Except where a member was regularly employed in industry,he would receive keep and pocket money from the Service.(4) Full-time members would be accommodated in camps, organised at schools,country houses, and around the existing facilities of various youth hostel andcamping organisations.(5) The work of the Service would be: (1) the cultivation on a group basisof land now little used; ditching, hedging, and land clearance; forestry work,(2) clearance of damage after raids, (3) salvage and the collection of scrap,(4) training for war industry.(6) At the outset the Service would be conducted on a limited scale with amembership of 10,000. In addition to full-time members, the Service wouldenrol adolescents giving part-time service while continuing their education and /orundergoing military training. For the leadership of the Service, it would bepossible to draw on scoutmasters, schoolmasters, and older professional men who now find no outlet for their willingness to serve.(7) An appendix to the memorandum sets out a detailed scheme for theorganisation of a Youth Labour Service.R. The Women&apos;s Services.   (J.M.)(1) Each of the three Women&apos;s Services attached to the Defence Forces(Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service, Auxiliary Territorial Service and Women&apos;auxiliary Air Force Service) have broadly similar conditions of pay and servicenot including regular separation allowances for dependants.   In each Service,
while the undertaking to serve is for a definite period/ the undertaking is notenforced by any penalty and some wastage through withdrawals occurs.(2) The establishment of the Auxiliary Territorial Service has been fixed at4o,ooo; that of the other Women&apos;s Services varies according to the changingdemand of the fighting forces to which they are attached. The desired intakeduring the second half of 1940 for the three Services together was about 28,500.(3) The Auxiliary Territorial Service had in July, 1940, vacancies for about10,000 additional recruits. The other Services do not normally find difficultyin filling their general numbers but experience shortages of persons with special qualifications.(4) The Women&apos;s Land Army is a voluntary organisation working under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and training women forwork with farmers. Its present strength is about 11,000, of whom 8,400 are in permanent agricultural work. The demand by farmers has been somewhat dis-appointing.(5) The Women&apos;s Voluntary Services work on an entirely voluntary basis inconjunction with local authorities, undertaking many miscellaneous duties placed upon them by the authorities.   Their present membership is about 650,000.(6) The following suggestions are made: (i) the three Services would benefit from a training scheme organised outside the Services to provide cooks, teleprin-ters, telephonists, etc., (ii) a general scheme of dependants allowances would aidrecruitment, (iii) the welfare side of the Services and the Land Army could be expanded, (iv) further sanctions may have to be applied to ensure carrying outof enrolment contracts, (v) the list of reserved occupations may require alterationto free women of age for the Forces who may wish to join and are prevented from doing so by Reservation.S. Local Man-Power Surveys.   (G.D.H.C.)In connection with the general Man-Power Survey conducted from London, itwas decided to undertake during July a series of Local Surveys, wherever these could be arranged rapidly and put into the hands of skilled investigators whowould not have to be taken away from essential work. It was not intendedto cover the whole country by means of these surveys, but only to selectcertain areas, including both those in which the most difficult problems were known to have arisen and enough others to furnish a reasonably adequate sampleof different types of area. In practice, most types of area, except primarilyagricultural areas, were adequately sampled, subject to the fact that it wasdecided not to include any area in Kent or Essex, outside Greater London, onaccount of the special difficulties likely to be encountered in such places at thetime when the Surveys were undertaken.It was possible to secure skilled investigators in a number of areas chieflybecause the end of the University term had released for the time being a supplyof University teachers and research workers who had not been absorbed into other Government services. These University teachers and also, teachers incertain Technical Colleges and a number of other highly qualified persons were found very ready to sacrifice holiday time in order to undertake the work; andthey in turn were able to enrol a large number of skilled helpers. In no casewere any salaries or fees paid to local investigators, who did the work free of charge to the Government, apart from necessary expenses incurred in connectionwith the Survey.The nature of the Local Surveys is explained in the instructions sent out tothe investigators, an abridged copy of which is appended to this note.A full list of the principal investigators in the various areas is also appended.It has not been possible to compile a similar list of the assistants who took partin the work under the direction of these investigators; but a few names havebeen mentioned where particular assistants were fully responsible for a particularpart of the report. In the London area, where the work had to be sub-dividedlargely by districts, a full list of the area as well as the regional investigators,is given; but this does not include many persons who gave valuable help in thevarious districts.
The full reports of the investigators, which have formed the main basis of most of the Memoranda, are filed at Montagu House and have been consulted notonly by officers of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, but also by officers of other departments, such as the Board of Trade and the Ministry of mines. They are much too bulky for reproduction in full; but it is believed thatthey will remain for some time useful for consultation as further questions oflocal man-power arise.Instructions to Local Investigators.I.The object of the survey is to discover (a) what local resources of man-power(men, women and juveniles) are at present not being used, or not being usedfully and to the best national purpose, (6) what are the main difficulties in theway of full use of man-power and (c) what steps should be taken to overcomethese difficulties.Local Surveys covering these points are being undertaken in a number of towns so as to obtain as definite a picture as possible of the situation.Investigators should establish contact with local officers of the Ministry ofLabour, educational authorities and heads of local universities, colleges, andtraining colleges, social and educational settlements, the local Trades Counciland the important Trade Unions, the local Chamber of Commerce, labourmanagers of local firms, and employing departments of the Local Authority or authorities.In general, the investigator should (a) avoid asking statistical questions whichcan be anwered from published material or through the local employment exchange; (b) avoid duplicating questions which he knows to have been asked by other enquirers, to whose results he can get access; (c) avoid asking manyquestions at once, at any rate until he is quite sure of his reception; [d) trustlargely to his memory (and write out his notes immediately after an interview)rather than present elaborate written questionnaires or take copious notes whileinterviewing.It is important that the investigator should not ask for information which isnot willingly given and should not present himself in any way as an officialinspector with powers to require information. Labour Supply Inspectors arebeing appointed by the Ministry to visit factories in connection with the readjust -ment of labour and the reports of these inspectors will be available to theCommissioner for Man-Power Survey. There is no need to attempt to duplicatesuch reports. It is important that any statements, particularly statements ofa critical nature as to misuse or waste of man-power, should be substantiated.In reporting such statements the investigator should make clear the authority on which they rest and whether or not they have been verified in any way.The investigator should bear in mind that, in the time and with the resources available, no elaborate survey is practicable. The purpose of the local surveysis rather to suggest lines that can be followed up than to provide detailedanswers to the questions supplied to him. .II.Scope of Survey.The main purpose of the survey is to discover what sources of man-powerexist in the area and are at present either not being used, or not being usedto the best national advantage. The chief potential sources are: unemployed workers, unoccupied persons, young persons leaving school or attending schools and universities and not in full-time gainful employment, persons engaged in domestic services, persons employed in unessential or not very essential industries and service, persons not fully employed, persons employed part-time.The next problem is to find out what local openings exist for the available supplies of additional labour. This has two main aspects the availability of skilled workers for the necessary supervisory and skilled jobs, and the avail-ability of plant. It also covers the availability of materials where suitablematerials could be supplied locally, e.g., by re-opening disused mines or quarries,
the like. Classes of labour here concerned are: skilled labour, less skilled labour, clerical and administrative labour, week-end labour, urban land workers,agricultural workers.0 Availability of plant.This question covers a wide field. The investigator should study, not onlythe opportunities for shift working and fuller use of plant in the essentialndustries, but also the extent to which there exist in the area unused, disusedor under-used, and also misused, factory buildings and equipment suitable oradaptable either for war or civilian production, or for use as training establish-ments for fitting additional workers for essential forms of service. Disused crunused mines, quarries and other sources of material should be included. Inaddition, it should be found out if there exist, e.g., in evacuated schools, work-shops and equipment which could be used for training purposes, and what arrangements are being made for their use.Availability of materials.In face of the shortage of supplies from normal sources, and of the exceptionaldemand for certain materials, it will be necessary to make increasing use of substitutes. Particular attention should therefore be given to local opportunities for the production of substitute materials to be used either in local factoriesor elsewhere, and to the adaptability of local plant for the use of such substitutematerials.Availability of accommodation.This applies especially wherever it will be necessary, in order to expandproduction, to bring in labour from other areas, e.g., London. The investigatorwill have to find out to what extent immigration of labour into the area undersurvey is expected, and to what extent adequate accommodation is, or can bemade available, at short notice, for the labour as it arrives. Clearly anunregulated flow of labour into areas already overcrowded may give rise to veryserious difficulties, and it is important to discover how far this is realised, andwhether measures afe being taken in anticipation of probable movements duringthe next few months.In general, it should be understood that the purpose of the survey is not confined to the discovery of additional man-power available for the productionof munitions, but is directed at least equally to the possibilities of usingadditional labour for the maintenance of civilian supplies. Moreover, civiliansupply must be understood as including the production of substitutes, by theuse of substitute materials and by resort to substitute processes and methods ofproduction.III.Apart from these specific questions, the investigator should include in his report some general comment on the conditions in the area under survey, inthe following, among other, respects :  (i) Are the local employers and workers broadly satisfied with the measuresso far taken to secure the effective use of man-power in their areas? Ifnot, what particular complaints do they make?(2) Are the local arrangements between employers and Trade Unionsworking smoothly, and, if not, what are the causes of any friction thatexists?(3) Are the local arrangements between employers, workers, and theMinistry of Labour working smoothly, and, if not, what are the causes ofany friction that exists?(4) Are the arrangements between main contractors and sub-contractorsworking smoothly?(5) Is there any trouble between local workers and workers brought in from outside, or introduced under schemes of dilution or substitution?(6) What is being done by local Technical Colleges, Training Colleges, etc.,to make their students useful for part-time or vacation work, and toorganise the use of their students as they finish their courses?(7) What arrangements are being made by Secondary and other schools in the area both for part-time and vacation work and for the effective use ofthose leaving school?
(8) What local arrangements exist for the use of Czech, German, belgian and other refugee labour, both skilled and less skilled, for replacing workerswithdrawn or withdrawable for war work, and to what extent has productionbeen affected by the internment of refugees or other aliens?(9) Where additional labour is theoretically available under any of the heads included in this memorandum, what are in practice the principalobstacles in the way of its use?Lists of Areas and Chief Investigators.(The places mentioned are the centres from which the local investigatorsoperated.
