The Ministry of Supply is already responsible for almost all motor transport production. If the Air Ministry&apos;s needs in this respect are also putinto the keeping of the Ministry of Supply, the whole production will be unifiedunder one control. It will then be possible to extend the manufacture of standardtypes of vehicles, so as to cover the requirements of the Air Ministry. This willmake for economy and speed in manufacture.3. I have consulted Sir Andrew Duncan, who is agreeable that this pro-duction should come under his Ministry.B.Ministry of Aircraft Production,December 21, 1940.[22043]
