IS TDOUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.3GRBT.&apos;298.COPY NO. -7)Uth November, 1940.WAR   CABINET.Skilled Wireless Personnel.MEMORANDTJM BY MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE.I1,     I understand that Lord Hankey has been charged by thePrime Minister to make an urgent enquiry into the problem of making good the large deficiency of skilled wireless personnel in theServices, and that for this purpose Lord Hankey has set up aCommittee under the Chairmanship of Lord Falmcuth consisting ofrepresentatives of the three Service Departments, the General PostOffice and the Wireless Telegraphy Board, as well as representativesof my Department.     This Committee now has proposals under considera-tion for dealing with the problem.2.     The increased production of radio equipment is not less important than its proper use in the Services, and will need to a large extentto draw on the same classes of personnel as those with which lord Falmouth8s Committee is concerned.     Unless there is properco-ordination of the demands for personnel on the two sides, there willbe an unregulated scramble for the available supplies and a consequent reduction in total efficiency.     My Department will be withoutauthoritative guidance in deciding relative priorities.3.     I suggest therefore that immediate arrangements should be madeto ascertain the personnel requirements for production, and toco-ordinate them with the requirements of the Services.14th November, 1940.(intd,)   E.B.H.Q,332-80 K.J.!1
