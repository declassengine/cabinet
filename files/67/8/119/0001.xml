TrffS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTEY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.C RJ T40) 319 Copy No.;th Decemberi 1940.WAR CABINET.RECONSTRUCTION OP TOWN AND COUNTRY.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I annex a Memorandum on the proposals put forward by the iiinister of works and Buildings for the reconstruction of Town and Country in W.P.(G) (4^) 321.liiy views can &quot;be summed up under the following heads:-1.   The first thing is to decide to what use is land to be put after the war -whether to agriculture, forestry or building development.2.   The agricultural use of land after the war will depend on the agricultural policy eventually adopted,5.   This policy will be decided by considerations, domestic and overseas, into whichtown planning can hardly enter.4.   We cannot afford to see good agricultural land lost to urban development ashappened after the last war.5. The inclination of Local Authorities is always to favour industrial and builddevelopment in order to secure increased rateable values.6. Any Central Authority or Government Department primarily concerned with builddevelopment assisted by an Advisory Council on which agriculture would only hone among many other interests represented could not be a suitable means for \preserving a proper balance between agricultural and urban considerations in 1use of land.7.   The planning of the proper use of land reserved for agriculture and fpre airy should remain a matter for Agricultural Ministers in consultation with the forestry commission.J8.   The planning of the remaining (and much smaller even though more valuable)areas could well be a matter for the Minister of Works and Buildings^9.   The first question therefore is what is the right body to decide what extentof agricultural land is to be devoted to building etc.     Possibly a smallimpartial Tribunal would fill the bill.(intld.)

1.       The iiemorandum on Reconstruction of Town and Country, if.P. (6) (40) 321, bythe Minister of Works and Buildings proposes the creation of machinery, including a central Authority and Regional Offices, to plan the utilisation of land and is naturally directed predominantly to the problems of industrial and urban reconstruction and development.     Plans, however, will also have to be made for the agricultural useof land after the war.     This will depend on the agricultural policy eventually adaptedand this in turn will be decided by considerations, domestic and overseas, into which   -town planning can hardly enter.     It would, I think, be generally agreed that any scheme for the control of the use of agricultural land must remain a matter forAgricultural ivdnisters and that the decision whether land is to continue to be used foragricultural purposes or to be diverted to industrial or urban uses cannot properly beentrusted to a Central Authority or Department which is primarily concerned with[industrial and urban development.2.      Since 1918 a million acres have been taken from agriculture in England andJwales, of which a large proportion was fertile land.     We cannot continue to risk ajresumption of this indiscriminate waste of our limited national capacity to produce[food.     iven more serious is uncontrolled industrial or building development in agricultural districts regardless of the labour and public services available in those districts.     Such development may dislocate agriculture and divert agricultural land[from its proper agricultural use for a radius of many miles round the land that is actually developed for industrial or building purposes.     Experience has shown thatthe poorer agricultural land is often unsuitable for &quot;development&quot; owing to bad   land drainage, contours, absence of services such as water supply, electricity and gas,railway and siding facilities and roads.     Obviously in any post-war planning the poorer agricultural land should be segregated and made suitable for &quot;development&quot; by(Supplying all the necessary services which it at present lacks, leaving the good-classagricultural land as agricultural.     Existing cities and towns should not be allowedto encroach on good agricultural land on their outskirts.     Development should takeJplace by means of new towns and villages sited on poor agricultural land in districts where they will not cause dislocation of agriculture.5.       It is true that the Minister of Works and Buildings in his Memorandum referso the need for planning the utilisation of the land to the best advantage but theubjects into which he suggests investigation should be made with a view to planningre nearly all connected with urban and industrial development.     He proposes thenation of machinery including a Central Authority or Department with Advisory and search Councils and Regional Offices for the purpose of planning.     The Centralthority or Department is to &quot;frame and be responsible for execution of a nationallan for best use of land - in widest sense - in national interests, covering thebcation of industry and development of areas, with adequate public utility and socialrvices, the main arteries of communication and of power services, and the reservationf national parks, coastal areas, etc.     Necessary functional responsibilities to be;sted in this Authority.       Local Authority machinery is to be responsible forIetailed planning of Local areas.4.      Planning on these lines and by this machinery would be quite unsuitable forgricultural requirements.     The Central Authority or Department and the Regionalthorities proposed by the Minister of V;orks and Buildings would have their attentiongely concentrated on the executive work of urban reconstruction and development andluid not be expected to hold an impartial view about the utilisation of land as!gtween agricultural and urban purposes.     Nor would the proposal to use Local^thority machinery for the detailed planning of local areas provide adequate safeguards1^ the proper use of agricultural land,     Experience has shown that Local Authoritiesjpays think in terms of rateable value and will always encourage any building or industrial development which will increase the rateable value of their area, howeverlch against the general national interest such development may be.II 5.       These considerations are re-ini&apos;orced by the fact that no amount of planningI &quot;lachinery for planning will secure an effective control over the utilisation of land.f crux of the problem is the need for control and in particular control over the sting right of the owner of agricultural land to sell it at an enhanced price fortdustrial purposes or building.   It will, I believe, be necessary to continue in somejpi the present war-time, control over the uses to which existing agricultural land mayfeput, but I feel sure that this can only be done as part of a general agriculturalficy which will provide a profitable use for the agricultural land of the countrych is reserved in the national interests for continued food production.
6.       I suggest, therefore, that if the Government is prepared to contemplate apolicy involving acceptance of the principle of control over the utilisation of land,the appropriate course would be to appoint an independent Central Tribunal quitefree from other executive functions to decide whether existing agricultural landis to be used (a) for agriculture, (b) for forestry, (c) for industrial or urban development, or (d) for public works, amenities, etc.     Such a Tribunal should beappointed by, and responsible to, a minister without departmental duties, e.g. theLord President of the Council or the Lord Privy Seal.     The placing of control inthe hands of such a Central Tribunal would not, of course, preclude the delegation to any central Department or to Local Authorities of the right to plan specifiedareas for building or industrial development. It would, however, prevent the ear-marking of particular districts or land for byilding or industrial development with-out the consent of the Central Tribunal.7.       Under this arrangement the proper utilisation for agricultural purposesof land reserved by the Central Tribunal for agriculture would remain a matter forAgricultural Ministers.     It would be based on the Land Utilisation Survey and thenew Farm Survey (which is being extended to provide a second Domesday Book) inaccordance with general agricultural policy.     Questions of rural housing,electricity, water supplies, transport, etc., in so far as they raise agriculturalrather than purely social considerations would continue to be taken up by agricultural Ministers with &quot;the other Departments concerned.     The forestry commission would be responsible for planning land reserved for forestry.     the planning of the remaining (and much smaller) areas scheduled by the CentralTribunal for industrial development, building, public utilities and public workswould be a matter for the Minister of Works and Buildings in conjunction withany Regional Authorities which he may appoint and with existing Local Authorities.HI2.
