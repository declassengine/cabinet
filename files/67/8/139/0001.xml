THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET &apos;W.P. (G) (40) 55951st December,, 1940.WAR&apos;  CABINETMEAT SUPPLIES AND THE MEAT ration memorandum BY THE MINISTER OF FOOD.1.        I propose, subject to the approval of my colleagues, to reduce the meat ration to Is. 6d. as from 6th January, pork and offals to be included.2.        Stocks of rationed meat in store and undischarged from ships in portare estimated at 36,500 tons on 6th January,&apos; including offals and pork.This working stock,should under no circumstances be further reduced, and ought to be increased at the earliest opportunity.5. Subject to war risks, arrivals of imported meat should average about18,000 tons a week, which is within the discharging facilities provided thelatter are not damaged by air attack. Of this, 16,800 tons will be rationedmeat. Home-killed supplies cannot for January be estimated at higher than12,500 tons per week of rationed meat. No measures to increase homeslaughterings can be effective in time to enable a higher meat ration to bemaintained.4.        Total supplies of rationed meat are estimated at 29,300 tons per week,of which the Services will absorb 4,000 tons after reducing their requirementsby 20 per cent.     This leaves 25,300 tons for civilian consumption, which is equivalent to 80j&amp; of the normal amount needed on a ration basis of is. 6d.5. In order to increase stocks, which are dangerously low, I propose thatthe ration should be is. 6d. and that only 75 per cent, of their nominalrequirements should be issued to butchers.     There are several souroes fromwhich butchers can supply their registered customers&apos; requirements with suchan allocation:-(a) the supplies drawn by the retailers for sale to catering establishments ;(b) corned beef issued by Area Meat and Livestock Officers, incases of proved necessity, for redidential catering establishments or institutions;(o)   sales hitherto made in excess of the ration.6.        The ration of is. 6d. which I propose is equivalent overall to ig- lbs.meat with average bone;   during meat rationing in 1918 the ration was, exceptfor two months, below 1 lb.     It is the absolute maximum which can be achievedwith present supplies, and I am running some risks in not proposing a lower figure.     In particular, if discharging facilities are damaged by air attack,imported supplies will fall short of my estimates,7.        In my opinion these are risks which are justified under presentcircumstances, and I therefore ask for approval;-(a) to reduce the meat ration to Is, 6d. as from 6th January;(b) to include pork and offals on the ration.This position may be improved when home-killed meat is more plentiful.COPT NO. S/fy
8. When the question of reducing the meat ration was before theFood Policy Committee on the 19th December it was decided that special consideration should be given in consultation with Ministry of FoodT. U. C. Advisory Ccmmittee to the needs of heavy workers in industryand the possibility of providing a supplementary ration of neat forsuch workers. This is -proceeding; but it will not be possible to inaugurate a system of supplementary rations, if decided upon, inthe immediate future.W.Ministry of Food,S.W. 1.31st December, 1940.
