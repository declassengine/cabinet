(40) 283.October 31, 1940.WAR CABINET.AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.IT is necessary that agricultural production in Britain should be increasedforthwith.The obligation falls heavily upon us on account of the enormous losses of foodstuffs sustained in transit by sea during recent weeks. We have alreadylost 14 per cent, of our planned import.It is therefore urged that the Minister of Agriculture should be directedforthwith to take the following steps to increase food production at home : (1) Import 200,000 tons of fertilisers from the United States, with a direction to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to supply the requiredamount of currency, and an order to the Minister of Shipping to bringthe fertilisers home.(2) Give a direction to the county agricultural committees to carry out such schemes of assistance as may in their opinion be necessary in order toimprove the output from neglected farmlands in their area.Questions relating to livestock should be determined later.B.Ministry of Aircraft Production,October 31, 1940.[21867]
