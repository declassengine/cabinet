WAR CABINETRECONSTRUCTION of TOWN AND COUNTRY.Memorandum by Minister of Works and Buildings.I.      INTRODUCTORYI, I was bid &quot;consult Departments and organisations concernedwith a view to reporting to the Cabinet the appropriate methc sand machinery&quot;.2.     The Special Areas and monstrous growth of London showed theneed for some control of the distribution of industry.    There ismore to it than questions of employment.    On grouping and densityof population depend the organisation of public utility and social services.      For a recent authoritative survey, see Report of royal Commission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population(Cmd.  6153 of 1940)*3.     Hitherto there has been no national direction of the use anddevelopment of land, nor co-ordination of information and research on the subject.      Planning is limited.    It is not concerned withthe distribution of population between areas or the promotion ofemployment.     Agriculture is excluded from its purposess  transport is not fully within its scope*    The Bressey Report,  thoughregional,  is an example of departmental planning,  and theRestriction of Ribbon Development Act of overlapping^betweenauthorities central and locale4.     Planning is essentially local, with little regionalapplication.      The primary authorities are boroughs and urban anjrural districts, and,  chough a number of joint committees havebeen formed, their work is handicapped by expense and lack of central direction.     Provisions for compensation and betterment jhave deterred authorities from embarking on effective schemes,5,     The system is not positive in the sense of securing thathousing development takes place as and where needed,      It doesnot control the growth of towns, with traffic congestion, lor? -travelling to and from work, and high site values.      Powers huvebeen used slowly, extent and skill of operation varying widely;in some areas not used at all.6.     On return to peace the problems of industrial location and social environment will be intensified by abnormal wardevelopments and by lag in prevision of normal services.7.     Public attention is now directed on prospects of reconstruction not just because of opportunities in restorationof damaged property but in hope of a fresh start in a new spiritof co-operation and with the high objective of a better Britain.8. Submitted below are basic objectives (II) and principles (ill),also the preparatory work (IV) which should be put in hand,II. BASIC OBJECTIVES9.
