THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT. )SECRET.W.P. 4-0)51121st November, 1940.COPY NO.WAR CABINET.SKILLED WIRELESS PERSONNEL.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.1. I agree with the views of the Minister of Labourand National Service and of the Minister of Aircraft Productionthat there must be proper co-ordination of the demands forpersonnel on the two sides of the question, namely,   productionof radio equipment and personnel enrolled in the services for its use.    That is one of the principles that I have kept in mind from the first.2. For this very reason I have taken as a guide thefollowing extract from a Note by the Prime Minister dated october 15th, 1940,  entitled &quot;Priorities&quot; (v.p.(40) 416) -&quot;The very highest priority in personnel andmaterial should, be assigned to what may be called the radio sphere.    This demands Scientists, WirelessExperts, and many classes of highly-skilled labour and high-grade material.    On the progress made, much ofthe winning of the war and our future strategy, especiallyNaval, depends.    We must impart a far greater accuracyto the A.A.  guns, and a far better protection to ourwarships and harbours.    Not only research and experiments,but production must be pushed hopefully forward from many directions, and. after repeated disappointments we shallachieve successThe Prime Minister, it will be noticed, lays equal stress onpersonnel and material, and I have been particularly careful to avoid placing one higher than the other.3. I am hoping to circulate in the near jreport setting forth in detail the arrangement!prowess for providing the skilled wireless no:future an interimwhich are insonnel recurredby thefutureServices, which will lirequirements.is still be in- awaitedCertain&apos;om Governmentelude not only immediate but alscmaterial vital to that reportcanDepartments, but Ianticipateat issue.it in this notefar as is necessary to the roint4. The most importipermit, might be tapped 1the Services for skillednt sources which,  if ci:or supplying the inanediatewireless personnel are acum stance sneeds offollows :-The Postmaster General, who has adopted a very helpful attitude, and who has just promised a largocontribution.A comb-out of the Army,  the results of which arenow being formulated in the War Office and which isprobably the largest single source of supply.The B.B.C., from which,  thanks to the good offices of the Minister of Information,  we are on the point ofobtaining a small number of very important key men for the higher grades in the Air Force.

The Radio Security Services on which I amin contact with the War Office.The British electrical industry, includingthe radio industry-,5. Preliminary inquiries by Lord Falmouth&apos;sCommittee, which has been helping me by exploring all sources of possible supply,  did not encourage rne to entertain any-Treat hopes of securing largo numbers of skilled wirelesspersonnel from the British electrical industry for immediatetransfer to the Services, for the very reasons given in the memoranda that are before the War Cabinet.    NevertherlessI have felt bound to explore it, and before seeing thememorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service I had arranged to meet representatives of the Departments concernedin this branch of production.    The result of this meeting,which was held on November 19th, confirmed my anticipations.6, Put briefly the position is that the FightingServices arc about to make, through the Supply Departments,very large demands on the radio industry for radio apparatusconnected with anti-aircraft and other defence requirements.Until these demands have been formulated it is impossible tosay whether personnel can be spared, from the industry or not.The figures that have been mentioned at my meetings, however,will make great olemands on the resources of the firms and could probably only be met by the curtailment of home production and export trade,  in which the Minister of information and the President of the Board of Trade respectively are closely interested.    In any event the bottleneck of productionof radio apparatus, whether for military or civilian purposes,seems likely to be found in the output of valves andcondensers, both of which arc under consideration by 1heauthorities concerned.    Until the position on these pointsis cleared up decisions on the various questions of poll cy willbe difficult to arrive at.7. In the circumstances I have reached the conclusionthat it would be unwise at the moment to make any demand onthe radio industry for the immediate requirements of skilled,wireless personnel for the Services.8. There are, however,  two steps which, I submit,ought to be taken at once.    There are a certain number ofarticles of electrical equipment being produced, the manufactureof which,  I understand, from the Board of Trade, could be shutdown without detriment to our war effort.    They include suchitems as the following:-(l) Domestic plate washers.(2) Pans with motors not exceeding 1/lOth horse-power.(3) Hair waving and hair drying machines.(4) Laundering machines.(5) Domestic vacuum cleaners.(6) Refrigerators with a storap-e capacity of notmore than 12 cu. ft.(7)    Common domestic electrical appliances, such astoasters, irons, plate warmers and kettles.

The actual list, however, is obviously a matter for thePresident of the Boo.rd of Trade to determine.9. If the War Cabinet will approve in principle theprohibition of further manufacture of these items it willrelease a certain number of men for radio purposes.    Forthe most part they will not be highly skilled but will havea basis of electrical knowledge enabling them to be rapidlytrained.10. The second step which I .surest is the raising of theage of exemption for electrical tradesmen, which is atpresent fixed at 23 years.    This would release a certainnumber of men with a foundation of electrical knowledge.11* The data are not yet available for a scientificapportionment of the men so released.    In these circumstances submit that the provisional decision should be of anempirical character and should be subject to adjustment whenthe requirements of the Services and of home production and exports have been settled ((c) below).SUMMAPY OF CONCLUSIONS.12. My recommendations are as follows(a) That the War Cabinet should sanction theprohibition of the manufacture of the articlesof electrical equipment mentioned in paragraph 8,and that the question of the possible curtailment of the manufacture of radio apparatus for exporttrade and the home market should be examined.(b) That the age of exemption for electrical trades-men, which is at present fixed at 23 years,  shouldbe raised.(c) That the Ministry of Labour and National service should be. instructed for the present to allot themen obtained by the above proposals in theproportion of 50% to industry and 50^ to theServices, but that this should be subject toadjustment when the requirements of the Servicesand of home production and export have been settled*(Signed)    HhNKEY.55, Whitehall, S.W.I.,21st November, 1940.
