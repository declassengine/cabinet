(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .SECRET. COPY NO.   Jjrf JQW.P(g)(40)  552.21st December, 1940.WAR     CABINET.RECRUITMENT FOR FIRE, POLICE AND CIVIL DEFENCE SERVICES.-Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service. \I have considered the proposals made in the Memorandum W.P. (g) (40) 324-of the Minister of Homo Security.I assume that the necessity for the reservation of the number of menasked for must be accepted. It should be recognised that the numbers tobe called up from other sources must be correspondingly increased.I am opposed to the method of indirect compulsion involved in callingthe men up for military service and then passing them to the Reserve.     Thismil be resented and will have dangerous repercussions.     If compulsoryrecruitment for the Civil Defence Services is necessary, it should be imposed directly and in a Parliamentary way.The alternative in present circumstances is to rely on voluntaryenrolment coupled with reservation.The detailed arrangements for enabling men to express their optionought to be capable of settlement Departmentally.     It will be essentialto avoid creating a pool of men reserved merely on the basis that theyhave expressed an -option and the arrangements must not be such as to upset the rest of the registration procedure.     Probably it will be best to allowmen to express an option when called up for medical examination if theyhave not joined one of the Civil Defence Services before that date.Consideration may have to be given to the question of extending tothe other Civil Defence Services the Order now applying to the AuxiliaryFire Service that men cannot resign except with consent.     There is a danger that such a step might not only prejudice further voluntary recruiting and temporary transfer to these Services but might be regarded as a breach of faith, particularly in the case of such bodies as the Demolition andRescue Squads.(Intld.)   E.B.Ministry of Labour and National Service.21st December, 1940.H.Q.507-80 L.J.
