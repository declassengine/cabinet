aTTP -nnp.Tn.TONT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S &amp;QVERMLENT,SECRETiFith August. 1940.WAR     CABINET.COPY NO.SALE OF VESSELS ORDERED BY THE   GOVERNMENT TO SHIPOWNERS WHO have lost VESSELS DURING THE WAR.Memorandum &quot;by the Parliamentary Secretary.In the absence of the Minister I submit the following1,       Subject to licence, private Shipowners have been allowed, sincethe outbreak of war, to place orders for merchant ships.     Ships orderedon private account before the war will continue for some time to be delivered to, their owners,     But since the 3:rcL September, 1939, few privateorders have been placed and merchant shipbuilding orders have been almostentirely dependent on Government action.2.       Unless owners who have lost tonnage are put in a position toreplace at least part of such losses, their post-war position will be muchmore difficult, and there is a risk that they will be forced substantially to reduce their technical staffs.     The mere receipt of war riskcompensation does not enable them to continue their business.3.       The Government could help the shipping industry by offering to dispose now of tonnage being built by the Admiralty on account of theMinistry of Shipping.     Experience after the last war shows that it is undesirable to unload on the market, on the conclusion of hostilities, alarge volume of Government tonnage;    an orderly sale to private shipownersin war time would reduce the risks of an unfavourable liquidation.     Thesale of such ships would not remove them from the financial and othercontrol of the Government during the war, because, like other ocean-goingliners and cargo tramps, they would be placed under requisition, oroperated at controlled freight rates on licensed voyages,k.,       A further advantage of sale would be this.     To the extent towhich the Ministry&apos;s offer is accepted, the Exchequer will be relieved of the cost of merchant shipbuilding;   while owners will not require toraise any large amount of new capital, as they will apply the moniesreceived as compensation for the lost vessels.5.       The acceptance of the scheme of sale would not involve any departure from the declared policy of the Government as regards the ownership of vessels built to Government account.     On the 7th February last,the then First Lord stated that merchant ships built by the Admiralty wouldbe delivered to the Ministry of Shipping, who would arrange for theirmanagement.     He added that the ultimate fate of those vessels rested withthe Ministry of Shipping.I6.       Nor would the proposal appear to run counter to the general policyof not replacing in war time property lost by private citizens as the resuliof war damage.     In this case, physical replacement cannot be postponed and&apos;the Government have already made provision, under the War Risks InsuranceScheme, for the payment of compensation for ships lost by war risk partly byImeans of an immediate cash payment to the owners and partly by payment intoa fund held at the owner&apos;s disposal, which can be drawn upon as soon as heplaces an order for new tonnage.7.       In view, therefore, of the advantages of enabling owners toreplace their losses now, with consequent relief to public expenditure andavoidance of part, at least, of the difficulties of post war liquidation,I seek the authority of the War Cabinet to announce that, as part of theGovernment&apos;s shipping policy, shipowners who have lost their ships by war
or marine risk and have not themselves placed an order for replacement, vd.ll be given the opportunity, in order of dateof loss, to purchase new Government built ships to replacesuch tonnage.The price at which the vessels will be offered will bethe actual contract price as paid by the Admiralty, plus anyaddition necessary to cover overheads, interest on outlay and war risk or other liabilities during building,     If at any time it appeared that shipowners who had fraught vessels completed since3rd September, 1939, were tending to claim for insurance purposesbasic values, which are recoverable in cash under the GovernmentTonnage Replacement Scheme, in excess of actual first costs, I might have to consider whether I should continue to offer vesselsat prime cost.80      Before making an announcement, I propose to give the associations of shipowners an opportunity of commenting on thearrangements for determining the order of priority in which these facilities for replacement by purchases are to be offered.9.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer agrees with this proposal.A. S.Ministry of Shipping,13th August, 194,0.
