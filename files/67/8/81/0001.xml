Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 281.October 30, 1940.WAR CABINET.100 OCTANE FUEL.Completion of the Thornton Plant.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.AVIATION fuel of 100 octane content is now a necessity for operational aircraft.2. Three British plants for the production of this fuel are in course oferection at Heysharn, Trinidad and Thornton. The first two will be completed in 1941.   Thornton cannot be ready before the last months of 1942.3. The estimated cost of the erection of Thornton is  9 million. an expenditure of  1^ million has already been incurred. Its output will be200,000 tons a year.4. Our requirements of this fuel for 1941 are covered. But in 1942, after allowing for purchases already made and the estimated output from Heyshamand Trinidad, we shall have to find 600,000 tons from other sources to meet our needs.  These will increase in 1943.5. America is the main outside source of supply. And we shall need topurchase at least 350,000 tons from the United States in 1942.6. The potential output of the United States has been reliably estimated at\\ million tons a year. Domestic consumption is now not more than 500,000 tons.Even allowing for increased consumption owing to military preparations, thereshould be an ample surplus available to meet our demands in 1942 andsubsequently.7. A decision is now necessary on whether we are to continue with theerection of the Thornton plant.B.Ministry of Aircraft Production,October 30, 1940.[21864]
