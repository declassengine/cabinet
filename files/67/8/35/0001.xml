DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.COPY. NO.   * IWAR CABINET. -RECRUITMENT OF PART-TIME VOLUNTEERS FOR CIVIL   DEFENCE.-Memorandum by,.the Minister of Home Security.1.     Recent experience has shown that the organisation of theCivil Defence Services is based on sound principles.   For themost part reliance is&apos; placed on part-time unpaid volunteers-, butin the more vulnerable areas a nucleus of whole-time paid-volunteers is maintained.    In general, the numbers of part-time volunteers are adequate;, though steps are being taken wherever possible to increase, the reserve in order that an undue strainshould not be.put upon the personnel with a conseauent risk -::of interference with production and loss      efficiency.2.     There are,, however, certain areas in.which the response to the appeals both national and local has not been satisfactory,and additional part-time volunteers, are required not only to.provide reserves, but to bring the establishments&apos; up to strength.These areas - include some important industrial centres,. e.g.B    Birmingham,. Liverpool and Coventry, where industrial workers arealready working long hours.    It is considered that even in -these areas there are still large numbers of persons In other A-occupations Who could reasonably be. expected to give part-time,service.    They have, however, failed to respond to the urgent    ;appeals and it has been represented in some-quarters that - -powers should be taken to compel selected classes of persons ,to be trained In air raid precautions and .to undertake part-time,unpaid duty in one of the Civil Defence Services.3.      I am advised that fresh legislation would be necessaryfor the purpose Of applying compulsion for part-time unpaidservice.    Under the plan that has been considered such compulsicwould hot be applied generally throughout the country, but onlyin areas where additional&apos;recruits were needed.    The localauthority would be required to register.men in specifiedclasses and after training to allocate thorn to particular services.    Compulsion would not -be applied to women and the service to be rendered would be limited .to a possible weekly minimum of four hours and a weekly maximum of twelve hours.     Persons sorecruited would be&apos; required to obey orders, and part-time volunteers already in the service would be asked to acceptsimilar conditions.    Compulsion would not be applied to personsworking long hours on essential war production, and provision would have to be made for individual exemption on personalgrounds.4,     It -would, of course, be possible to limit the exercise0&quot; compulsion to men over military age.    There- would, however,probably be considerable public support for the application01&apos; compulsion to workers in certain reserved occupations whoseajjL C R E T.22j--h September, 1940.
retention on their civilian work is regarded as essentialbut who are not necessarily working long hours... .:1&apos;-have.- inmind particularly certain clerical and professional occupaand men in supervisory posts in a variety of-.trades.    TheMinister of Labour wduMJ be ready- t:0; advise- on&apos; the selectiof reserved occupations from which men might be selected aable to give part-time service in Civil Defence ,without::personal hardship or interference with production.5.      It. must, however, be borne in mind that to compel aman to.give&apos; service without remuneration is :a*&quot;Strohg measure and that the Civil Defence Services have been established onthe voluntary principle.    The introduction of compulsionwould be a considerable departure from the conception of theService as a duty undertaken by. the citizen as part of-a-co-operative organisation for protectinglife and-&quot;property inhis district.    Moreover, there are obvious objections to theapplication of&quot;-compulsion -on a- local basis -according to the sior failure of a local authority to obtain volunteers. &apos;  Those iare pressing for compulsion are not familiar with the serious difficulties in. the preparation and administration .of. a icheiof compulsory/unpaid--part-time service, and.it is by no. means certain that there is-any-strong body of opinion in&apos;supportof it, either    publicly or among the local authorities...6. - In the circumstances, while I think the Cabinet, -shoulibe.aware :of the form in which the problem has arisen,. I, suggested,that: it would be- better to exhaust the alternatives beforeundertaking.-.legislation of this character. - The first is thatareas where more volunteers are needed the Ministers concernei(The Home Secretary and Minister of-Home Security,&quot; the&apos; minister,.bf- Health and. the. Secretary- of State for Scotland) should arrin. conjunction with the. Minister of Labour and. National Ser.?i?for a personal appeal, to be addressed to men in selectedreserved occupations who might-be expected by reason of; their occupation to be in a positionytd give part-time. serviceV.&apos;;.&apos;.These would be men who&quot;have already registered under the. . &quot;rMilitary Service Act and. the necessary particulars would..&apos;,;&quot;.&apos;,,therefore :be available to enable a personal&apos;&apos;appeal to be.&quot;jpacfeThe appeal would not-only extend to&apos; the-A.R.P. Services, by;would cover, where necessary, the&apos; A.F.S&apos;., Special Constables,Ambulance and First Aid -Post Services &quot;and Stretcher Bearers&apos;2.Casualty Hospitals.    There, is-also the possibility; of reciproarrangements between the Home Guard and the Civil defence services, and this I am examining with the Secretary of Statefor War in the light of    the recent discussion in the WarCabinet.    If such arrangements -are practicable,  special attencan be given to co-operation - in those areas&quot;where&quot;there arcdifficulties in maintaining the Civil Defence Services.   ,J.A.Nil? 13 TRY OF HOME   SECURITY.11th September. 1940.
