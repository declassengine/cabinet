(THIS DOGUMMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)S I 9 R E T. COPY NO.W.P.(G,)(40) 269.2^rd October., 1940.W AH     CABINETTRANSPORT OF COAL.  ...Memorandum by the Lord President.1.     At their Meeting on the 9th October the War Cabinet invited me to review the question of coal supplies (W.M.(40) 268th Conclusions,Minute 11).       I have held a number of meetings with the ministers concerned,  aid I think it will be convenient if I submit to the WarCabinet at this stage an interim Report dealing with the transportof coal to London and the South of England.2.     I do not think it necessary to trouble the War cabinet with a detailed statistical review of the position.    ,  Throughoutmy discussions I have proceeded upon the basis that every effort should be maae, between now and the onset of winter^ to bring South -and particularly into the London area - the maximum amount of coal which our transport system can carry without prejudice to other vitalsupplies.       The importance of avoiding a serious coal shortage this winter is admitted on all sides^    and our aim has been to make such arrangements as will secure that during the coming weeks we shall bring into London and the South every ton of coal that can be carried by all available means of transport.3-     Transport by rail.       Since the beginning.of September theintensification of air attack has involved considerable congestion and delay in the delivery of coal into the London area  and beyondLondon to the South.       Damage to railways has prevented coal fromgoing forward to its destinations in Central London and.through london to the Southj   and damage to consignees&apos; premises..has, in some cases,prevented coal from being delivered to them.       This has causedcongestion of coal wagons in marshalling yards,exchange sidings andstabling points, with the result that the traffic has tended to becomeblocked right back to the pits.Our first task therefore was to seek effective means ofrelieving this congestion of coal wagons in., and in the neighbourhoodof, the London area$   and the biggest problem was to find a ready meansof disposing of coal which was held up on the railways because it couldnot be delivered to the original consignees.       Arrangements have nowbeen made to deal with this difficulty - (a) by more effective andexpeditious machinery for finding an alternative consignee who willtake delivery of coal which cannot be accepted by the original .consignee!   and (b) by ensuring that., if coal so delayed cannot besent at once to an alternative consignee, it will be diverted withoutdelay to Government dumps in the London area, where it will remain until it- can be transferred, by road transport if rail is not available, to
the consumer.The Mines Department have set up a Standing Committee to dealwith the diversion of coal wagons.       This Committee includesrepresentatives of the coal trade and a railway expert attached tothe -Mines Department.       It meets daily, and special arrangements have been made to ensure that it shall receive without delay full particulars of coal which cannot be delivered to its originaldestination.       It has been agreed that,, if the Committee cannotwithin twenty-four hours designate an alternative consignee for coal so delajredj the coal shall be diverted without further delay to a Government dump.The Mines Department have already established a number of thesedumps in the London area, particularly in the East and North-East.The railway companies have represented, however, that the position could be further eased if a number of additional dumps were provided on the North and North-West.       The Mines Department are taking stepsto establish further dumps in this area without delay.To facilitate the arrangements described above, the trade has agreed, at the request of the Mines Department -(a) to ignore all but essential differences of quality(e.g. between gas or steam coal and household coal)j(b) to rationalize distribution from local depots and thussave transport and labour    and(c) to examine the possibility of adjusting the prices of household coal by local pooling schemes.4.     The arrangements described above relate to the disposalof coal which has been brought into the London area but cannot be delivered to its original destination.       The Mines Department areconcerned also with the problems which would arise if the railway situation within the London area deteriorated to a point at which coalcould not readily be handled by rail inside the area.       To meet sucha situation,, it is proposed to establish large dumps on the peripheryof the London area, so that coal can be brought by rail to the. peripheryand delivered thence by road transport.       For these dumps it will benecessary to provide long sidings, capable of accommodating a -wholetrain, and to equip them with the necessary handling plant.       Theestablishment of dumps on this scale, and the provision of the plant, must take some considerable time    and it is doubtful whether any of these dumps can be established in time to relieve the situationthis winter - at any rate in the earlier part of the winter.       But^although these dumps do not form part of our plans for the immediatefuture, every effort is being made to ensure that they shall be provided and equipped with the least possible delay.       It will be necessary toensure that priority is given for the supply of the requisite materials,mainly steel.5-     Transport by sea.       During the summer months from april to June, when special efforts &quot;were being made to build up stocks ofcoal in the London area, the tonnage of coal delivered to London by sea from all areas averaged 250,000 tons per week;   but during theautumn and winter months we cannot expect to bring to London by seamore than a maximum tonnage of 225,000 tons a week.       During august the average weekly delivery was 195,000 tons.    and from the end ofAugust up to the end of the first week in October the average weeklydelivery v/as I65..OOO tons.       In recent weeks, therefore, there hasbeen a deficiency of 60,000 tons per week.       The Admiralty and theMinistry of Shipping have agreed to take all practicable steps to remedy this deficiency - (a) by increasing the number of vesselsallocated to the London coal trade and (b) by making every effort,
8.     I am keeping the position constantly under review, and will report again to the War Cabinet upon the &quot;progress of &quot;the variousin co-operation with the other Departments concerned, to accelerate the turn-round of coal ships in docks in the London area.     Inparticular, it has been agreed that in the last resort coal reaching the Thames or the Medway may be discharged into barges requisitionedfor that purpose so that the shipping may be freed more rapidly forthe return voyage.       The Mines Department will be responsible forarranging that coal thus discharged into barges shall be sent eitherto alternative consignees or to Government dumps.6.     Coal brought to the Thames is only part of the seabornedeliveries to the South of England.     During the period from april to July, 1940, 40,000 tons per month were delivered by sea throughports between Gravesend and Margate, and 100,000 tons through portsbetween the Lizard and Gloucester.       If the rate of deliverythrough these two groups of ports (in addition to the 100,000 tonsdirect to Channel ports) were maintained, there would still be a deficiency of 35*000 tons per month to reach the minimum seabornerequirements for the South of England, viz. 275?000 tons.The Ministry of Shipping hope to be able to maintain the 40,000tons per month delivered through the Gravesend/Margate ports.The Lizard/Gloucester ports appear to hove the capacity todeal with 135,000 tons per month under favourable conditions.The effect of the Admiralty Order restricting approach to within three miles of the coast in hours of darkness and the navigationallighting restrictions at the ports will, however, severely curtailthe use of the ports in winter months, particularly at those times when both tides fall in hours of darkness.The Ministry of Transport have undertaken to press forward as rapidly as possible with the provision of equipment whichwill increase the capacity of some of these ports to handle coaltraffic, as well as other goods.       During the winter months, however,the restrictions imposed by the Admiralty on defence grounds will seriously limit the effective use of this new equipment^    and We mustbe prepared to find that the tonnage delivered through these portsduring the winter may fall considerably short of the 100,000 tons per month achieved in the period from April to July.7.     In addition to transport by rail and by sea, I have exploredthe possibility of increasing the amount of coal -which is now beingcarried by canal.       There is reason to believe that at least 100,000tons of coal per year could be brought to London by canal, in additionto the amounts already convej^ed by this meansj    and I have asked the mines Department to proceed wj th their efforts to increase the carriage of coal to London by canal.The Minister of Transport is also considering, at my request,what steps should be taken to ensure that, in an acute emergency,road transport shall be available for the transport of coal in theLondon area.
-measures which&apos;, have already been taken to deal with the situation.&apos;l&apos;..will at the. same time report the result of the investigationswhich I am making into the coal position in other centres of population apart from London and the South of England.J.A.PRIVY COUNCIL OFFICE.23rd October, 1940.
