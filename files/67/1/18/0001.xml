COPY No.^,^,;.?.Cr)  (59)18.WAR CABINET.RESTRICTION OF IMPORTS FROM CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary   of   State forDominion Affairs.In accordance with the conclusions of the ,/ar cabinet held on the 20 th September,  I telegraphed to the United kingdom high Commissioner in Canada regarding the proposed restrictionson imports of apples and tobacco from that Dominion.      I attach a copy of my telegram and of the High Commissioner1sreply which has  just been received.It will be seen that the Canadian authorities have so far reacted very unfavourably to these proposals.      This isnot unexpected;    and the High Commissioner urges that our action should be suspended pending a further reply from the canadian government after they have had an opportunity of consideringthe matter in more detail.As I anticipated, the Canadian authorities make thevery important point that it is unsatisfactory that we shouldbe taking action in respect of these two commodities in which canada is particularly interested and of which she is a largesupplier when the whole question of handling the dollar resources problem in relation to Canada has not yet beendiscussed with the Canadian Government in detail.The

J-he position as to this is as follows.      In thePrime Minister&apos;s message of LJep-teuiber 5th to Mr. Mackenzie- Sing,in reply to the latter&apos;s enquiry how Canada could best help.,it was stated,  inter alia,  that if dollars were available theUnited Kingdom Government would wish &quot;Do increase largely our normal imports from Canada of certain foodstuffs and rawmaterials,  in addition to finished   munitions,  air-craft etc.,and that perhaps the most valuable immediate assistance which canada could give in this field would be any steps which were possible to assist us in the financing of the desired purchases -The Canadian Government have not yet returned a definite replyto this proposal, but are,  it is understood,  anxious to discussthe matter in detail as soon as possible with a FinancialRepresentative of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United KingOamArrangements fcr sending such a representative are in fact un(it-ir-consideration, but he will not,  it appears, reach Ottawa for another fortnight.It will Du understood, that,  with matters in this position,  a sudden decision on our part to prohibit or limitimports from Canada into the United Kingdom which are ofspecial economic and. political interest to Canada,  such asapples,  is bound to have an extremely bad effect on thegeneral atmosphere.      The Canadians will obviously feel thatit is wrong that we should be pressing them to supply andoven finance purchases in Canada essential to our interestswhile we are taking unilateral action which must damage their essential interests.      Clearly there is a strong case for considering both sides of the question together.In the circumscances, I would most strongly urge that our proposed action    should be suspenaed and that itshould

should be re-examined on a.more comprehensive basis.     I confersto being- very apprehensive that immediate action may befound in the long run to have done us more harm than good,.Our requirements from Canada by way of finance are certain to be very large  in view of the magnitude of our essential requirements from Canada on the supply side;    we must there-fore be most careful not: to start the delicate financial negotiations in an unfavourable atmosphere.      It will be seen from Sir Gerald Campbell8s telegram that he regards it as of the greatest importance in this connection    that thefinancial   discussions should start with the least possible delay.      The instructions which the United Kingdom Financial!Representative will receive will presumably be co-co-ordinated with the supply side,  and it seems to me very important thatthese instructions should take account also of the Canadiandesiderata as regards their exports to us which they regard as essential to    themselves.A     T.1A        aopinions Office.22nd September,  19 39.Since the above was prepared I have received theattached further telegram from the Canadian Governmentdirect,  which emphasizes and re-inforces the considerations put forward above.

CYPHER TELEGRAM.

CANADA

From the Government of Canada.

Dated 21st September, 1939. Received 8.12 a.m. 22nd September, 1939.

PRIORITY IMPORTANT.

No. 82 Secret.

Canadian Government are seriously disturbed by the economic and financial problems presented by certain aspects of United Kingdom plan for war time purchases from Canada. They fully appreciate the importance your Government attaches to conserving the dollar exchange and recognize that this may require some restrictions on less essential imports from Canada. Our ability to co-operate with your Government in meeting these problems depends, in part, on degree to which war costs can be equitably distributed between different parts of Canadian economy and on maintenance of public confidence that primary producers in Canada will receive equal opportunities to sell at prices as fair as may be negotiated with any other Empire or foreign suppliers.

2. As you are aware, we have been endeavouring to work out the most effective means of co-operation with the United Kingdom in the economic as well as in the military field. We feel certain that your Government fully share our view of importance of such close co-operation and in shaping your programme as to purchases of supplies full consideration will be given to broader aspects of policy involved.



g.   Clearly our ability to assist in financingexpanded United Kingdom purchases in Canadian market will beeffected by terms and estent of United Kingdom pu.rchas.es ofapplesj tobacco, wheat, cheese;, bacon and other agricultural products.     Curtailment of such purchases&apos; would compel theGovernment to finance domestic holding and distribution ofthese products for which alternative markets are not available.4.     We feel that transfer and credit problem presented byanticipated expansion of United Kingdom purchases mast be viewed as a whole and are worried by apparent tendency ofvarious United Kingdom supply organizations to offer arrange-ments on widely different terms of payment with differentCanadian interests, e.gv, proposals for purchase of base metalsat a guaranteed sterling exchange rate must embarrass   considera-tion of proposals to purchase farm products without assuranceagainst effect of fluctuating exchange, &apos;    Similarly proposals&quot;for financing purchase of certain products by partial blockingof sterling proceeds appears to us to complicateunnecessarily the general dollar-sterling exchange position,5*,   What we urgently re quire f and what we have beenendeavouring to secure, is knowledge of your plans in respectof purchase of all primary products and also war supplies from&apos;Canada.     We would   then bo in a position to discuss credit facilities in various forms on a substantial scale,,     In thecircumstances, suggest immediate advisability of UnitedKingdom arranging for a representative or representatives todiscuss with Canadian Government the whole range of theproblems connected with the purchase and finance of UnitedKingdom requirements in Canada including question of shipping.60

today by Sigh Couniasionar for united Kingdom, we stronglyurge t/Ziac un^xx t-nere mg oeen an ooport unity &apos;;,or direct negotiations on wider problems, a final decision should notbe reached nor any public proclamation made in regard to imports of tobacco and fruita
