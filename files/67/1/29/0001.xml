SECRET CoPy No.    (0WbP.(G)(39) 29,W AH     C A B I N E TINDIA AND THE WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(previous Reference: Memorandum W.P.(G)(39)24)&quot; The following telegram from the Viceroy,describing his interview with the President of theIndian National Congress, Mr. Rajendra prasad, and withMr. Jahawarlal Nehru, is circulated for the informationof the War Cabinet.Z.INDIA OFFICE.5th October 1939.Telegram from Viceroy, No.2I57-S, dated 3rd October 1939.Frivate and personal.    I saw Rajendra Prasad andNehru for Z\ hours to-day but fear that no advanceproved possible.   Rajendra.Prasad was, I would judge,1open to some degree of conviction and was merelyrepeating a set piece.   Nehru was as impervious toargument as Hitler and pretty clearly has made up his mind on demands extensive to a degree which we couldnot contemplate.2.       I have told them both that I must think the matter over in the light of what they said, and consult with theleaders of the other parties, and that if they wish inthose circumstances to adjust their time table and to(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s1 Government)

- 2 -postpone the meeting of the Working Committee, etc., theywould no doubt let me know, though I recognise that thedecision on that point must be for them.    I emphasisedthese were matters on which I could not accept the claim of Congress to be the only party or interest to be consulted, and that so far as I was concerned and quite apart from the obligation on me to refer back to HisMajesty&apos;s Government, I had to ensure that I was inpossession of the mind of all the other important partiesincluding the Princes.3.        Claim as stated to-day with great emphasis byNehru is briefly for: (a) Declaration which Nehru wishes to be &quot;full-blooded,   positive and unambiguous&quot;, whichmust use the phrase &quot;absolute freedom&quot; for India at theend of the war, and provide also for her unfetteredliberty to frame her own constitution by means of a constituent assembly,    (b) Such declaration to be accompanied by the immediate share of power at the Centrethough he admitted that he was not too clear as to the precise machinery involved.   Neither prasad nor Nehrudisplayed the least anxiety to face up to complicationsof their proposals in terms of reactions on Moslems,i Princes, etc.    It was interesting to see, however, thatI  they are clearly profoundly disturbed by possibility of&apos;an all-parties conference.    I asked them whether, if Iwas driven to have one, they thought Congress would attend.4.        They replied that while they could speak only for themselves and (?as yet) ad referendum, they were disposed to view that Congress would not attend.    I will telegraphfurther as soon as possible in greater detail but think you will wish to have this immediate resume of essentials,Question of representation of India at.peaceConference was mentioned by Nehru but in general termsonly, and whole discussion was on general lines.

5.        I have had to-day a long protest from BombayLiberals, Scheduled Castes represented by Ambeokar,Mahasabha represented by Sarvarkar, and Parseesrepresented by Cowasjee Jehangir. against any settlement which does not take full account of their interest andon which they are not consulted,    I propose to haverepresentatives of all four up here in the next 4 or 5days and also to take advantage of the Chancellor&apos;sreadiness to come and see me again.6.        My Impression is still that while there is no grealdesire on the part of Congress to break, they may find themselves driven into doing so by Nehru&apos;s pressure.There is also now I am sure considerable Left Wingpressure from Subhas Lose who has himself telegraphed tome to-day protesting against the operation of ordinancesin Bengal, and who,I have little doubt, is anxious tomake himself a martyr as soon as possible in interests ofembarrassing Right Wing.   Main general impression left onme by this morning&apos;s conversation is of deplorable gap in quality between, my interviewers and Gandhi.
