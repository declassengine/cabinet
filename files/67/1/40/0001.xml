(TTTTS^pCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY15 GOVERNMENT)q 3 C R E T. I / COPY NO.    ^ ^WAS CABINETThe Press and Censorship Bureau under the supervision of Sir Walter Monckton.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1.    The decision of the Government that each Department shall be responsiblefor issuing its own news and that responsibility for the exercise of censorshipover individual items of news shall rest with the Department concerned with thesubject matter, leaves unsettled the question of Ministerial responsibility forthe staff of the Press and Censorship Bureau and for certain general questionsrelated to the functions of this staff which are distinct from questions related to the is.&apos;3&quot;CU2?.g cr censoring of particular items of news.2.    In the absence of legislation creating some statutory body to perform thefunctions of the Press and Censorship Bureau,  the staff must be attached to comedepartment and must be the servants of some Minister,    This Minister must beresponsible for seeing that the staff is adequate and not excessive, is properlyselected and competent for its duties and is properly organised.    This Ministermust also be answerable for things done cr left undone by the Bureau, except sofar as such acts or omissions are consequent on the decisions of the various departments which are responsible for issuing particular items of news or for the censorship of particular items of news.   He must also defend the expenditure onthe Bureau in Parliament and his Department must account for that expenditure.3.     The following illustrations may be given of the responsibilities which will fall on the Minister to whose Department the staff are attached:(a) Although each Department is responsible for issuing its own news,the arrangement by which news is also distributed from the Press Bureau involvesproper co-ordination between the Departments and the Press Bureau.    Complaintshave ariseri&quot;&quot;beCause news has been issued by seme Departments to certain PressAgencies before it reaches the press Bureau where it is issued to other Agencies.The Minister responsible for the staff of the Bureau will have to deal with thismatter.(b) This Minister must also deal with general representations to theeffect that the staff is not well qualified for its duties, that more trainedjournalists should be employed and so on;    with general complaints about delays;and with other general complaints about methods as distinct from particularcomplaints about the withholding or censoring of a particular item of news.Moreover he must be answerable for errors made by the staff as distinct fromerrors resulting from instructions issued to the staff by other Departments.(c) General questions will arise about the position of the Press Bureaum connection with propaganda articles in newspapers and pamphlets.    Some of thisPropaganda will not be related merely to the subject matter of one particular department, such as the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, the War Office or the AirMinistry, but will be related to the general war policy of the Government;    and questions will arise as to how far the Press Bureau is to attempt to exercise anycontrol over such propaganda,        i  (d) General questions will arise about the censorship of films.    To seeiat films do not convey information which should not be made public is a^Paratively simple matter and it will be for the Department concerned with theuoject matter to say whether a film should be disallowed or &quot;cut&apos; or altered.PrU   Sti011S about propaganda films will arise which cannot be dealt with asoblems, for the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry or Foreign Office. Questions/will

will also arise as to whether the British Board of Film Censors which has been acting as agents for the Ministry of Information in this matter is asuitable body for censoring of propaganda films.4.     It is proposed by the Treasury that the Home Office should be made responsible for the staff of the Press and Censorship Bureau.   Before adecision is taken to this effect, it seems desirable that there should be aCabinet decision as to the nature and scope of the ministerial responsibility which will be placed on the Home Secretary by this arrangement.   Is it agreedthat while the arrangement will place on the Home Secretary no responsibilityfor the issue of news by Government Departments (each Department will beresponsible for issuing its own news) and no responsibility for the censorshipof particular items of news (the Press Bureau in censoring items of news will act on the instructions of the Department concerned with the subject matter),the Home Secretary will by becoming responsible for the staff become responsiblefor     general   questions as to the suitability of the personnel and as to theorganisation of the Bureau and for all such questions relating to its functions and activities as are not placed on other Departments by the decision that each department is to be responsible for its own news and for the censorship of items of news falling within its subject matter?J.A.HOME OFFICE,17th October, 1939.
