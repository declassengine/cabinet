J Q R E To^fQ)(39)46oCOPY NO.AS AWAR CABINET.URGENT MEED FOR CHA^BiUnG NEUTRAL TONNAGE,(First Lord&apos;s Paper Y/.P. (G)(39)57)o(Minister of Food&apos;s Paper \7.P. (G)( 39)42).Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.At a conference at the Treasury this afternoon withthe Minister of Shipping and Sir Cyril Hurcomb,  with the-Minister of Food and Sir Alan Anderson (Chairman of the cereals Control Board of the Ministry of Food), with admiral Burrough, Deputy Chief of Naval Staff and withMr, Butler representing the Foreign Office, we endeavoured to ascertain the essential data in this matter withparticular reference to the need for increased freight spaceto carry wheat and other cereals to this country now andin the immediate future,2, The essential facts are as follows.      In normal circumstances 500,000 tons of wheat are imported into thiscountry per month?    300,000 tons of other cereals (mostlyfeeding-stuffs) are normally imported per month.    Thus, in normal circumstances,  the need is for freightage for cerealcargoes at the rate of 800,000 tons per month,3* The Ministry of Food, in estimates andcalculations made as at the end of September last,ascertained that they then had secured freightage for importing during the next two moths (first October to 30thNovember) a total of 1,031,000 tons of cereals - 626,000 tonsbeing ^sheat  and 303,000 tons being maize.      Since then    theposition has been slightly improved as they have beenprovided with another 306,000 tons in round figures.      Thus,for these two months, the provision up to date totals1,337,000 tons, whereas our normal requirements for twomonths would be 1,600,000 tons.      So far the shortage is

263,000 tons    But to this must he added a deficiency inthe month of September of 131,000 tons.4. Thus, the deficiency to he provided against between now and the 30th November    is, in round figures, 400,000 tons.A certain amount of tonnage has already been secured for subsequent months, but naturally the additional amount to bemade up increases as the period is more distant.   JThe-monthof December is so near that the shortage of provision forthat month (now 450,000 tons) is very material.    If weinclude December,  the total shortage of cereal freightage atthe present moment is about 850,000 tons.5. The above figures do not allow in any way forsinkings en route or losses due to air attack in port.   T7eascertained that some of the figures in the Ministry of PoodPaper which was before the War Cabinet this morning wereswollen Toy an assumption (apparently dating hack a long way)that we ought to allow for one ship out of four being lost through enemy action.    Admiral Burrough agreed that thiswas manifestly much too high, but he pointed out that upto the present we had experience of &quot;U&quot; boat attacks but none of surface attacks or attacks on merchant shipping from theair at sea or in port.    Instead of attempting to deduct a percentage which must be pure speculation, it seems much better to take the figures as they stand, while rememberingthat a suitable allowance must be made for losses by enemy action.6. The problem therefore is how best to secure the filling up of the gap of freight space for 400,000 tons ofcereals down to the end of November, and an additional450,000 tons if we go down to the end of the year.

70 In considering this, it must he remembered thatfreight space for cereals is by no means the only claim whichthe Ministry of Shipping has to meet, though it is probably the biggest single clairn0      In fact, cereals constitute about half the total tonnage required by the Ministry of Food.Meat, of course, requires refrigerated space and specialshipso     The two reamining items of chief importance aresugar and oil seedsa      To all this must be added the overseas needs of the Ministry of Supply0      It is,  of course,Impossible to estimate these by reference to pre-war figures which is our principal guide in the case of food estimates.80 There are two other propositions to be studied inthis matter before the necessary  : 1 ;:.v...:&apos;?t3 have been set out.The above figures as to our needs in importing food are onthe assumption (1) that consumption will remain the same as before the war and (S) that existing stocks in this country are maintained intactc     We have no stocks in store of maizeor barley;    in the case of barley we of course have thisyear&apos;s harvesto    But in calculating the home harvest of barley or of wheat it must be remembered that the crop instack is not immediately available and that large demandsare made upon it for animal feeding and seedoIt is evident that if we had to make good the wholedeficiency of       weeks&apos; supply at present in prospect to31st December out of our available stocks, we should, after weeks of war, have reached a dangerous scarcity,9. It is obvious, therefore, that the urgency ofsecuring neutral tonnage is extreme0      The Minister ofShipping gave a full account of the immediate prospects.When the Norwegian deputation comes hack at the beginning of next week, it is confidently expected that they will be inthe mood te a^g^tlate and a bargain promptly struck with them

will make an immense difference.     The number of iforwegiantramps is very large,     Admiral Burrough pointed out thatif a limited number of Morwegiaa ships made the voyagesuccessfully under British protection, the effect on neutral shipping generally would be very great.     It is a fur-thcj?argument for making a prompt bargain with the hbrwegiansifor unless agreement is rapidly reached, freight rates may go up further.     On the other hand, if we needlessly give&quot;panic&quot; prices, we are setting a standard for other neutralsand for British ships as well which may well endure for thewhole of the war.10*       Another important consideration was pointed outby Sir Alan Anderson.      &quot;.heat from Canada, when it reachesthese shores on a c.i.f. contract costs about  8. 6. 0. aton.      If the -wheat comes from the Argentine, the correspond-ing price c.i.f. is A6* 16. 0. a ton.     Even after allowing for the longer haul, therefore, it might pay us to acquire the use of neutral shipping to bring over the large stocks of&quot;wheat already acquired in the Argentine and awaiting shipment^even though the freight charges brought up the normalArgentine price substantially.11.        As reagrds the Greeks, the Minister of Shipping gave an account of his interview with the Greek Minister thismorning and Mr. Butler has already seen to it that thedespatch is going to our Minister at Athens to bring allpossible pressure at the other end.(Intld.)
