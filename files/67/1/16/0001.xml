(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAlTlTIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT^.     &quot;  &quot;   /(39)16\/ COPY NO.   ^rKWAR CABINET      vControl of Sale and Purchase of Wireless Transmittersand certain other Electrical Apparatus.Memorandum by the Postmaster General.1.In the Government War Book - Part I Chapter X 4F -the Post Office is directed &quot;to prohibit the sale orpurchase of wireless sending apparatus as detailed in a schedule to be published&quot;.2.     The method of carrying out such a scheme wasconsidered by the Control of Radio TransmissionSub-Committee of the C.I.D., on which the Defence Services,the Home Office, the Board of Trade, the B.B.C. and thePost Office are represented.     This Sub-Committee recommended the adoption of a scheme on the following lines(1) The sale or purchase of articles which form anessential part of wireless transmitting apparatusshould be prohibited - except with permission ofthe Postmaster General - even if such articlesare required for purposes other than wireless telegraphy.     A list of such prohibited articleswould be published at the time of the putting into force of the regulations.(2) Persons wishing to purchase any articles in theprohibited list would have to make application tothe Post Office for permission to do so giving thepurpose for which the article was required andnaming the firm from which the purchase was to bemade,(3) Each application would be scrutinised by the PostOffice Engineering Department, who would if deemed necessary make enquiries locally and also consultother Government Departments (e.g. M.I.5) as tothe standing of the applicant, or as to thedesirability or otherwise of acceding to theapplication.896/39

(4) In the case of persons such as registered medical practitioners, hospital authorities, collegeautaorities and firms of repute permission topurchase reasonable quantities of equipment wouldhe granted as a matter of course.(5) The list of prohibited articles should be subjectto revision from time to time but at the outsetit is recommended that it should comprise thefollowing articles(a) Complete wireless transmitters or essentialparts for use with such transmitters.(b) Line Carrier Equipment.(c) High frequency equipment including MedicalApparatus and Eurnaces.(d) Electronic valves capable of an anodedissipation exceeding 10 watts.(e) Piezo Electric Quartz or Tourmaline Plates orCrystals cut to oscillate at any specifiedfrequency.3.     The Sub-Committee have recommended that thePostmaster General should issue an Order under Regulation55(1)(a) of the Defence Regulations, 1939, prohibiting thebuying, selling, letting, hiring, supplying or acquiringwithout a Post Office permit of any of the articles specifiedin paragraph 2(5) above, -which virould be included in a listembodied in the Order,     The Sub-Committee emphasised theimportance of ensuring that the scheme should be operated insuch a way as to put no hindrance in the way of purchase of equipment either by firms and organisations working forGovernment Departments or by other authorised users of wireless telegraphy or wireless telephony in war time.4.     The scheme is directed not merely against the useof wireless apparatus for illicit transmissions but alsoagainst the use of certain types of electrical apparatusin such a way as to give a &quot;beacon &quot; to enemy aircraft.    Thecontrol exercised under the scheme would not be complete;but the action taken would, it is considered, be ofconsiderable

Illconsiderable use in supplementing the other measures thatwill be taken to detect any illicit use of wirelesstransmitters or other electrical apparatus.5.     The Minister for the   Co-ordination of Defence hascirculated the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendations to theMinisters whose Departments were   represented on theSub-Committee and in addition to the Minister of Health whoseDepartment is concerned.    The only suggestion made for anychange in the scheme was that of the President of the Boardof Trade, who expressed the view that it might be foundnecessary to extend the scheme to include the control ofimports and possibly also the requisitioning of existingstocks of apparatus so far as might be practicable. He agreed,however, that there was no objection to the scheme beingproceeded with on the lines proposed, leaving any extension to be considered later if found necessary.6.     I am accordingly arranging, at the suggestion ofthe Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, for theintroduction of the scheme as soon as the necessary preliminary arrangements have been completed.   Every effort will be made by my Department to avoid placing any hindranceor undue delay in the way of purchase of equipment for anylegitimate purpose.7.      It will be some weeks before the scheme can bebrought into operation.(Intld.) G-.C.T.General Post Office,23 September, 1939.
