CHANGE OF MEET TNG PL^CE OF PARL LAMENT.CONCLUSIONS OF A CONFERENCEHELD IN THE SPEAKER&apos;S LIBRARY,HOUSE OF COMMONS ON MONDAY, 2NDOCTOBER * 1959, AT 6 p.m.PRESENT:The Lord Chancellor tllQ Chair)The Attorney General.The Earl of Lucan.Sir Henry Badeley.Sir Granville Ram.Sir Oscar Dowson.Mr- Speaker-The parliamentary secretary to theTreasury.Sir Claud Schuster.Sir Gilbert Campion.Sir Rupert Howarth.Mr.C0J. Harris.1. The purpose of the Conference was to considerthe question of the change of the meeting place ofParliament at a time when the Houses stand adjourned,withoutbringing the session to a close, if it should become impossible owing- *ic e.itemy action for the Ho-vis^tfto continue to sit at Westminster.       Those presenthad before them a Note by Parliamentary Counsel dated28th September, 1939, on the constitutional and practical aspects of the question.       A copy of this note is, for convenience of reference, annexed to these conclusions.2.       It was explained that the Note by parliamentary counsel represented the conclusions reached by an informal Committee of Officials which had considered theconstitutional position on the assumption that (apartfrom the arrangements mentioned below) no procedure

for effecting the removal of Parliament from Westminster willhave &quot;been laid down in advance either ly Act of Parliament, or0y Defence Regulations or &quot;by Resolutions of the Houses.      Thequestion of privilege involved is not one of the privilege of either House hut of the privilege of Parliament.      The positionof &quot;both Houses in this matter was therefore identical.      an examination of the precedents had confirmed the ancient and well established constitutional rule that it is for the Housesthemselves to decide on the time of their adjournment and thatany action on the part of the Crown which savoured of anattempt to induce or compel the Houses to adjourn, when theydid not wish to do so, has been continuously and successfully resisted in the past.      Every Session of Parliament is, however,held upon the basis of the prerogative Writs summoning the parliament and in those Writs Westminstc3r has been named as theplace of Meeting.      In practice,  therefore, action loth ly theCrown and by both Houser of Parliament was necessary ^efore theHouses could constitutionally adjourn to a. place other thanWestminster.3. In the concluding paragraph of the Note provision wasmade for the very improbable contingency of the Houses &quot;being unable to meet at Westminster for the purpose of adjourningthemselves to H. K.      The Law Officers had approved the draftProclamation attached to the Note to le used in that eventand had expressed the view that should it become impossibleor impracticable for the Houses to hold meetings at which to adjourn themselves, there is power under the prerogative todeal with the matter in this way.

4o       Lastly there was the question9 mentioned ui thefourth paragraph of the Note, of the interpretation ofthe expression &quot;at Westminster&quot; i,e.9 - did this havethe wider meaning of anywhere within the boundaries ofthe modern Ciiy of Westminster or did it have the more limited meaning of the existing Parliament &quot;building andits precincts?5o       The Attorney General thought that it was mostImportant to maintain unimpaired the inherent rights and privileges of the Crown as to the place of meeting ofParliament and that in particular no doubt should &quot;beoast on the necessity of obtaining the Crown&apos;s consent to the place to which it is proposed to adjourn.60       Mro_Speaker strongly emphasised the view that whatever might be the true position today in regard tothe prerogative power of the Crown to change the meetingplace of Parliament during a session it would be most unwise and undesirable to tai-ce any action which might be interpreted as an attempt on the part of the- Crown to adjourn the House of Commons without their consent,  aprivilege which the House had enjoyed and zealouslyguarded for centurieso7o       He (Mra Speaker) declined to contemplate the contingency of it being impossible or impracticable forthe Houses to meet at Westminster in order to adjournthemselves and in his view the expression !&apos;at Westminster&quot;meant the present   Parliament building and its precints,80       The views of Mr, Speaker met with general concurrenceand the Lord Chancellor expressed the opinion th..t the riskof it being impossible or impracticable for the Louses tomeet at Westminster to adjourn themselves was one which inthe circumstances it would be justifiable to take-

9o The Conference then discussed the procedure to &quot;befollowed on the assumption that the Houses would meetonce again in the Palace of Westminster or its precinctsfor the purpose of adjourning themselves to H.K.After examining various alternatives it was agreedthat the most satisfactory procedure from the points ofview of constitutional propriety, the convenience of theCrown and the Houses and expedition would he one on thefollowing lines -(i)      In pursuance presumably of a decisionof the War Cabinet a submission would he made to His Majesty by the Prime minister that messages under the Royal Sign Manualshould he sent to &quot;both Houses0     The -Attorney-General suggested and the conference agreed that  me operative uart of each ofthese Messages might be to the effect thatHis Majesty considering that in presentcircumstances the House may not he ablo^safelyand conveniently to continue to meet at,i.Westminster is graciously pleased to&quot;declareHis Consent&apos; to the House meeting at sin the event of any adjournment of theHouse jiduraJigi the oprc^cnt Session ofParli raento(ii)     The Message would be announced in the Houseof Lords &quot;by the Lord Chancellor5 and in theHouse of Commons would he delivered at the bar of the House by the Prime Ministerand read to the House by the Speaker orthe Deputy &quot;Speakers,(iii)     Each House would then send an Address thankingHis Majesty for His Gracious Message,(iv)     Each House would forthwith adopt a Resolutionadjourning itself to H*K. to meet thereat an hour and on a date named in theResolution-.(v)      Finally in order to give notice to the publicof the changed meeting place of parliament and to place the whole matter on a formalbasis9 a Royal Proclamationshould he issued as soon as it would heconvenient for His Majesty in Council to approve the Proclamation,,&apos;*   Naming the place designated by the letters H.K.

10.       With reference to (iv)  above the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury warned the Conference that incertain circumstances it night, he difficult to securethe acceptance by the House of Commons, at all events in the first Instance, of a Resolution to adjournforthwith to Ho PL       For example the quorum might consist mainly of members representing London constituencies who might, in the circumstances, well be reluctant to agreeto an adjournment to H,k1     While he did not anticipate that this difficulty   tou.1c\ .j.n fact arise * the possibiiiijy-of its doing so could not be altogether ignoredo      TheConference agreed that in. this event it would be necessaryto re-introduce . the adjournment &quot;Resolution? ...-11*       The Conference also agreed that the above conclusions should be communicated to the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for Home Affairs and Ministerfor Home Security,,12o       The conclusions reached by the Conference may besummarised as follows -(a) Apart from the arrangements specified in(b) and (g) below,,-  no procedure for effecting the removal of Parliament fromWesouJnster should be laid down in advanceeitheo by Act of Parliament or &quot;by defence regulations or by Resolutions of the Houses.(b) The consent both of ibe Crown and of theHouseo is necessary before the Houses canconstitutionally adjourn to a place otherthan Westminsterc(c) The contingency that it might be impossibleor impracticable for the Houses to meet^at westminster in order to adjourn themselvesto some other place could be disregarded.

CHANGE OF MEETING PLACE OF PARLIAMENT,NOTE BY PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL.The Government has envisaged that if London isbombed a decision may be taken to change the meeting placeof Parliament from Westminster to a provincial town des-cribed by the code letters H.K.      This decision might betaken either because the Houses of Parliament had beenactually -destroyedi or because the danger of their being destroyed was so imminent as to make it too risky for theHouses to continue to sit at &quot;Westminster, or because theremoval of Parliament from Westminster was necessary inconnection with a decision to evacuate the Administration.(The latter decision might not necessarily be necessitated by the physical destruction of Wndtehallj...butJby the factthat, owing to the constant interruption of work by air raid warnings or because of the difficulty in the way ofcivil servants getting from their homes to their Offices,the competence of. the government-gnachinery would be seriously impaired by keeping it in Whitehall).The arrangements for transporting the members ofParliament to, and for housing them at, H.K.  have been made and the question of the constitutional procedure for effecting the move has been under consideration.      This questioninvolves consideration of the relations between the crown and Parliament, both as regards the respective rights and privileges of the Crown and parliament in relation to any .move from Y/westminster, and as regards the administrative arrangements to be made for communication between theCrown and parliament in this matter.Different considerations arise according as thenecessity to move Parliament arises while the Houses standadjourned during the session or while Parliament stands prorogued-8-

at the close of sessiom     The latter case is not ofgreat urgency, becsmse there is no immediate prospectof bringing the session to an end;    and except thatthe Law Officers have advised that it is within theRoyal Prerogative to change the meeting place ofParliament during the period of prorogation, detailed consideration-has not   yet &quot;been given to this side ofthe matter.     The urgent question is what is to bedone for the purpose of changing the meeting place otParliament at a time when the Houses stand adjourned,without bringing the session to a close.The Speaker of the House of Commons has strongly expressed the view that, whatever prerogative power the King may have at the present day to change themeeting place of Parliament during the session,nothing should be done which would appear to weaken the resistance which the Commons have always shownin the past to any attempt on the part of the Crown to adjourn the Commons without their consent;    and thatthe proper procedure would be for the House to meetonce again at Westminster and to pass a resolution,with the King&apos;s consent, adjourning the House to 11.K,This involves the proposition that the Houses,  in meeting

gro&amp;rio motu somewhere in Westminster, but not within theprecincts of the present Parliament building, would not beinfringing the Royal Prerogative.    Obviously, it is arguable that when one is dealing with the question of the meeting placeof Parliament,  &quot;Westminster&quot; ought to be construed as referring to a smaller area than the present city of Westminster.    Onthe other hand, it is difficult to see where to draw the line between the original Westminster (vhiiah was a strip of landabout 400 yards square comprising the Abbey and the Palace of westminster) and the local government area which at presentconstitutes the city of Westminster.    As the present parliament was summoned in 1935 to meet at the city of Westminster, there ismuch to be said for the view that this summons would not bedisobeyed by the Houses meeting anywhere in the present city of westminster.If this view is correct and if, as it probably canbe, it is assumed that the Houses will meet once again at westminster for the purpose of adjourning themselves to H*K*,the question then is what procedure should be adopted for obtaining King&apos;s consent to the adjournment and for communicatingthis consent to the Houses.    In giving his consent, the Kingwill of course be acting on the advice of his Ministers, but it.is not felt to be necessary that the consent should be given by theKing in Council.    A submission would presumably be made to HisMajesty by the Prime Minister in pursuance of a Cabinet decision.The consent, would be conimunicated in the House of Lords by theLord Chancellor, and in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister,announcing that he had it in command from His Majesty to acquaint the House that His Majesty had consented to the adjournmentQf the House to, (naming the place described as H.K.)This statement would -be -immediately followed by the passing ineach house of a resolution adjourning the House to that place-There would be no objection, from the point of view of secrecy,

to mentioning the new place of meeting by name in theseproceedings5 for arrangements could no doubt be made thatin any report of the Parliamentary proceedings the newplace of meeting should be referred to simply as H.K..In the unlikely event of it being impossible forthe Houses to meet anywhere in the city of Westminster forthe purpose of adjourning themselves to HoK0s it is feltthat the change of meeting place should be effected underthe sanction of a proclamation in the terms of the draft attached to this note.,      The Law Officers have approved thedraft and have expressed the view that should it become impossible, or impracticable for the Houses to hold meetings at which to adjourn themselves5 there is power under the prerogative to deal with the matter in this way.September a 1959 -
