DESPATCH OF PERSONAL MESSAGES OP CONDOLENCE.Memorandum, by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence.On the 31st August the Question was raised as to what action should be taken in regard to thedespatch of Personal Messages of Condolence duringthe war.      It was decided that it would be appropriate that the matter should, in the first instance, be explored inter-Departmentally, with a view to its consideration later by Ministers.The matter was accordingly remitted to an inter-Departmental Conference, held under the Chair-rnanship of Sir Herbert Creedy.      It will be observedthat this Conference in its Report dated 6th September(Annex I) reached the conclusion that., in view of the magnitude and complexity of the problem, it was forconsideration whether any satisfactory method for thedespatch of Royal Messages to individuals could be devised.The Report of the Inter-Departmental conference was brought to the notice of the Ministers primarily concerned.      While the majority of the ministers concerned expressed agreement with the Report of theConference, the First Lord of the Admiralty expressedthe view that the time-honoured procedure of sending

10 0Royal Messages of Condolence should not be abandoned.     An extract from a letter from theAdmiralty dated 12th September, setting out theFirst Lord&apos;s views, is annexed.   (Annex II)*The matter was accordingly again remitted to the Inter-Departmental Conference, and a copyof its Second Report, dated 20th September, which contains a statement of the pro&apos; s and con1 sin thisquestion, is annexed.  (Annex III).The matter is clearly one for Ministerialdecision and I accordingly circulate these Papersfor the consideration of the War Cabinet.(Intld.)    0.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,25th September, 1939.

Army Officers.The Keeper of the Privy Purse sent a telegram tothe next of kin of officers and nurses, who were killed,died of wounds or died of disease,  in the following terms:-&quot;The King and Queen deeply regret the loss you and theArmy have sustained by the death of your ............in the service of his Country.    Their Majesties trulysympathize with you in your sorrow.&quot;3.     Army Other Ranks.The notification of death to the next-of-kin bythe Officer in charge of Records on an Army Form B.104/82was accompanied by a printed slip which,  in its latestform, bore the Royal Arms and the block signature of theSecretary of State for War&quot;and said -&quot;The King commands me to assure you of the truesympathy of His Majesty and The Queen in your sorrow.He whose loss you mourn died in the noblest ofcauses.      His Country v/ill be ever grateful to him-3-

for the sacrifice he has made for Freedom and Justice&quot;.4. The Admiralty procedure both as regards officersand men was practically identicalsPuture Prjcedure.5. The Conference was impressed by the great change inthe circumstances since the late War caused by thedevelopment of Air Power,    There is a vast service of A.R.P.which will be liable to the same risks of death as the personnel of the three Fighting Services.    The Police, theCivil Service,  civilian employees of the Government, munition workers and many other categories may all be regarded as inthe front line and the ordinary man and women in the streetmay lose their lives by enemy action.,6. They recognise that the final determination of thequestion is a matter of high policy, but they are all agreedthat it would seem impossible for a Royal message to be sent by telegram to any considerable number of persons owing tothe congested state of the telegraph service and itsliability to rupture.-    Further,  they consider that it wouldbe impracticable to differentiate between the Fighting andthe Civilian Services,  the representatives of the Ministryof Health and Ministry of Home Security pointing out thatthey had no central machinery for notifying individualcasualtiesc    Such casualties would be notified locally fromthe hospital concerned,    The Conference was unanimous in thinking that any scheme of a Royal telegram was not workable.7. Alternativelyj  the King might be pleased toauthorise the Ministers of the three Fighting Services to incorporate a message of Roy a.&apos;, sympathy in the officialnotification of the death to the next-.-of-k-in. .The representatives of the Ministry of Health andthe Ministry of Home Security pointed out, however,  that service and civilian casualties might occur simultaneously and-4-

that one hospital might contain individuals of all categories whose inpuries might prove fatal.    Anydiscrimination in the matter of messages might prove a source of embarrassment which the representativesof the fighting Services recognize while naturallyrather favouring the despatch of some Royal message to their Services.8.       In view of the magnitude and difficulties of theproblem, it is, then, for consideration whether any satisfactory method of the despatch of Royal messages to individuals can be devised.    If this view were accepted,  the Government might wish to make a publicpronouncement so that those who had recollections of royal messages in the late War might appreciate thereasons for the decision taken.9.       On a subsidiary point, the representatives of theService Departments favoured a uniform method of officialnotification of death in a message conveying the sympathy of the Board or Council,  signed by the Secretary or  thePermanent Under-Secretary of State.(Signed on behalf of the Committee.H.J.  CREEDY.War Office,6th September,  1939.

ANNEX IIExtract from a secret letter, dated 12th September, 1959,from Sir Archibald Garter, Admiralty, to Sir Edward Bridges,War Cabinet&apos; Offices.&quot;The First Lord of the Admiralty is of opinion thatwe should not abandon the time-honoured procedure of sending Royal messages of condolence.      In these days themachinery of a telegram from the Palace is probablyimpracticable, but there seems no sufficient reason whythe appropriate department should not be authorised to convey a message of Royal sympathy.Any abandonment of this tradition in the case ofthe fighting services would,  in the view of the First Lord,be deeply to be regretted.The First Lord agrees that under the conditions ofthe present War it would not be possible to confine Royalmessages of sympathy solely to those serving in the NavyPArmy and Air Force. He considers that they should be sentto all who are killed on duty, whether they be members ofthe fighting services or civilians.No doubt the problem of who is to be regarded as a civilian on duty is not entirely free from difficulty butit seems likely that it ought to cover not only CivilServants, in the ordinary sense of the term, but all thosewho are for the time being employed by the State, such asambulance drivers, fire fighters, A.R.P. wardens, and the like.The First Lord considers it important that theRoyal condolence should only go to those who are on dutyat the time they are killed.

There is one class of individuals intermediatebetween those killed while directly in the employ of theState and the ordinary civilian, namely, those who arekilled while employed at the works of Contractors.     TheFirst Lord has not made known hi-s final views as regardsthis category, hut .1 think he is inclined to the view that itwould not he possible to include them.It is, of course, slightly invidious that Royalcondolence should go to a workman who is killed in a royal Dockyard and not to a workman killed while in theemploy, let us say, of Vickers.      But the practicaldifficulties of extending- the condolences to those employedby Contractors seem,  so far as can be seen in the Admiralty,insuperable, since there would be immense difficulty indealing with such cases as Sub-Contractors or Contractorswho are partly employed on Government work and partly on commercial work,&quot;

ANNEX III.DESPATCH OF PERSONAL MESSAGES OP CONDOLENCE.Report of second Meeting of InterdepartmentaO. Conferenceheld on 20th SEPTEMBER,  1939, &quot;&apos;1. At the request of the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence, I presided to-day over a further meeting of the interdepartmental conference to consider the question ofthe despatch of personal messages of condolence.      Theconference was composed of:-Sir Herbert Creedy The Y/ar Office.Mr. H. Eastwood The Admiralty.Mr. J.B. Abraham The Air Ministry.Mr. K. McGregor The Ministry of Health.Mr. T.B. Braund The Ministry of home security,and had been instructed to draw up a statement setting out the pros and cons of the matter for consideration byhigher authority.2. The Committee agreed on the following list of prosand cons.Pros.The precedent of the lastT as regards the Fightingrvices, and the historicalElection of the Fighting ServicesLth the Crown.The absence of a Royalsage may cause surprise and^appointment to the bereaved,ho often keep and frame suchUsages.Cons.The development of air warfarehas created a new situation.I,    Personnel concerned.The whole country is a potentialbattlefield and the vast majorityof the population may be regardedas a source of potentialcasualties.    It is difficult inthese circumstances to differentiate between:-(i) The Fighting Services.(ii) The Civil Service and civilian employees of theGovernment.

1-iO(iii)    Police5 Fire Brigade., HospitalsA.R.P.5 etc,j personnel.(iv)    Employees of Government contractorsor siib-contractors.(v)    Members of the general public who may be killed either when helpingothers or as victims.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggests thatthe message should be sent only to those who are on duty at the time they are killed.      (This wouldexclude (iv) and (v) above,, )     The duty criterion,howevers  is open to the following difficulties:-(l)     The difficulty of justifying a distinction &quot;between workers on munitionsemployed by Government or employed bycontractors.(S)     The. difficulty of distinguishing,, inthe case of Category (iii) personnel,when they are on duty and when not.Even in the case of the Fighting Servicesit v/ould be difficult to maintain the distinction and in practice it wouldprobably be found that messages wouldbe sent to the next of kin of allpersonnel of the three Services who were killed.There may also be civilians killed in theexecution of the moral, but self-imposed, duty of helpingtheir neighbours.IIo    Practical Piff,i,culties.(a)    Telegraphic communications will be loadedand will be liable to rupture, and for this reason theCommittee recommend that Royal condolences should in no case be sent by telegram.

Hi(b)    The Civil Departments stress theextreme difficulty, if not impracticability,of applying any such procedure to civilianair raid casualties, which might unhappilybe on a very large scale.     Victims of air raids might -(a) die at their homes,(b) die in the streets and be taken to amortuary, where the bodies may be eitherclaimed by relatives or buried by apublic authority, or(c) die after admission to a casualtyhospitalcAll these categories differ as regardsthe machinery of notifying both public authorities and next of kin and make the delivery of a Royal message both difficult and uncertain-,     Moreover, there are likelyto be difficulties as regards the identification-tion of the victim and the tracing of thenext of kin which do not arise in the FightingServices.These are the reasons which moved the Committeein their previous report to recommend that there shouldbe no Royal message.     The only practical alternative would seem to be to confine the message to the three FightingServxces.    There are, however, serious objections to thiscourse in that its adoption might well cause dissatisfactionand disappointment to the various categories of civil defenceworkers and other civlians.Signed on behalf of the Committee.H.J. CREEDY.War Office,&apos;*th September, 1939. -10-
