THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET.COPY NOW.P.G.(39) 36.WAR CABINET.&quot;STOP THE WAR&quot; PROPAGANDA.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1.     There are at present three main groups of persons conducting&quot;stop the war&quot; propaganda^(&quot;b) The Communist Party.     Until a few days ago the Communist party were in favour of waging war against Hitler, while at the sametime continuing the attack on capitalism.     Within the last fewdays they have changed their view and are now maintaining thatthe war ought to be stopped.(c)   The Peace Pledge Union,There are also individual publicists who maintain that the main objectfor which the war is being waged is the prevention of the spirit ofagression and that their object cannot &quot;be attained by warfare, (this isthe theme of Mr. Bernard Shaw&apos;s article in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; ofOctober 7th).2.     This propaganda is conducted (a) by means of articles innewspapers, including &quot;Action&quot;, the organ of the British Union ofFascists, and the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, the organ of the Communist Party;(lb) by speeches, incla&amp;ing speeches at open-air meetings by both Fascistsand Communists;    (c) by leaflets;   and (d) by the posting up of smallbills and &quot;stickybacks&quot; and the writing of slogans on walls,3.     The Defence of the Realm Regulation 39B provides that &quot;no person shall endeavour either orally or otherwise to influence publicopinion.......in a   manner likely to be prejudicial to the defence ofthe realm or the efficient prosecttion of the war&quot;.     Prosecutionscannot be taken under this Regulation in England or Northern Irelandexcept with the consent of the Attorney General,      In Scotland allprosecutions are subject to the control of the Local Advocate,(a) The British Union of Fascists. Their slogans arePeace&quot;: &quot;Why shed British blood for the Poles?&quot;: &quot;&apos;being waged in the interests of Jewish finance&quot;.e &quot;Mosley for&quot;The War is

- 3 -4-..    Certain cases have &quot;been reported by the police where personshave been found distributing leaflets or writing up slogans or have beenheard making anti-war speeches, and there has &quot;been some consultation betweenthe Attorney General and the Home Office as to the action to be taken inthese cases.     In many such cases the question to be decided is notmerely whether the information   available as to the circumstances ofthe offence shows that there are sufficient grounds in law for bringingproceedings, &quot;but also whether   it is expedient on grounds of policy for a prosecution to be taken.     7/hile the responsibility for deciding whethera prosecution shall be taken rests with the Attorney General, it has &quot;beena long-recognised practice that he shall, &quot;before taking action in casesof this kind, ascertain the views of the Government on questions ofpolicy.5.     It has &quot;been felt by the Home Office that in selecting the firstcases for prosecution   care should be taken to find as strong a case aspossible and that it would &quot;be preferable that the first proceedings shouldbe in respect of propaganda inciting persons to withhold their co-operation in the war effort.     There has however been, hitherto nothing which could be interpreted as a direct instigation to persons not tojoin the Army or not to make munitions.6.     No doubt if prosecutions are taken in respect of &quot;stop the War&quot;propaganda which contains no incitement to abstain from helping in thewar effort the defence will be that the defendant has done nothing to prejudice the efficient conduct of the war, that he recognises that ifwar   is to be waged it must be waged with vigour, that he has not sought to dissuade persons from engaging in national activities requisite for theconduct of the war, and that his sole object has been to persuade people&quot;by constitutional means that the Government are mistaken and that a peacepolicy should be substituted for a war policy.     It is perhaps unlikelythat such a defence would be accepted by a Court;   but prosecutions may,especially if they are directed against the activities of the PeacePledge Union, excite some sympathy for the defendants amongst people who, while they support the Government war policy, nevertheless dislike,even in time of war, the introduction of what they will regard asdictatorial methods of suppressing liberty of speech.7.     Several questions of policy have be be considered;(a)   Whether it is better to take action by way of prosecution now or to wait for a time.m   Whether prosecutions should be directed against all forms of anti-war propaganda including speeches and newspaper articles or only against certain types, such as leaflets and posters at thepresent stage.

(c)   Whether, if prosecutions are to be started, cases should bebrought against agents of the Fascists, the Communists and thePeaoe Pledge Union alike,8.      (a)   On the first point it is difficult to be certain whetherthejxopugairla  in question is having any substantial effect.     Ifit is causing little mischief there is less need for repressiveaction.     On the other hand, if measures of suppression are tobe taken, it would be better that they should be taken beforethe agitations have reached any large dimensions.(b) It is suggested that a distinction can be drawn betweenleaflets, posters and writings which are thrust upon people&apos;attention willy nilly, and propaganda by means of books or paperswhich people need not buy or by means of speeches to which they need not listen.      It must, however, be recognised that ifprosecutions are taken only in respect of notices and leaflets,they will generally be directed against the subordinates and not against the principals.     It will be argued for example that ifprosecutions are taken against those who distribute Fascistsleaflets, a prosecution should also be taken against Mosley andthe leaders of the British Union of Fascists.(c) Since the change of policjr on the part of the CommunistParty, the new   &quot;stop the war&quot; policy has been advocated in the&quot;Daily Worker&quot; but no leaflets advocating this policy have cometo the notice of the Home Office.     The former Communist leaflets were directed to showing that war should be conducted vigorouslyagainst Germany while at the same time there should be oppositionto the existing Government.     Probably Communist leaflets of a&quot;stop the war&quot; character will now be issued, and if this is doneprosecutions might be taken both against the Communists and theFascists .9.       It will then be necessary to take similar action in respect of leaflets issued by the Peace Pledge Union,,     This Union was founded by the rev. Dick Sheppard, and the present Secretary is Canon Stewart Morris, acanon of Birmingham Cathedral,     It is believed that George Lansbury isstill the President of the Union, and amongst the members of the Gbunciljust prior zo the outbreak of war were Vera Brittain of the IndependentLabour Tarty, Laurence Housman, J. Middleton Murray, Arthur Ponsonby,Maud Royden and Andrew Stewart; it is not known whether any of them haveresigned recently.Andrew Stewart is the candidate who has been standing in the EastStirl ingshire election rm.fl his candidature was supported by Mr. Maxton andLord Ponsonby.10.     Regulation 39B is very wide in its terms and care must clearlybs taken as regards its application.      To launch a number of prosecutionsin respect of newspaper articles or speeches which advocate a &quot;stop theWar&quot; policy would, I suggest, be inexpedient at this stage at any rate.

On the other hand, a3 regards &quot;bills or written notices and leaflets, ifproceedings are limited to any cases where there is a direct incitement to refrain from co-operation in the war effort, I fear this may be toonarrow a restriction.     It is important to check from the startpropaganda which by its reiterated and cumulative effect tends tocreate a defeatist spirit.     Moreover, since the last announcement bythe Prime Minister showing that   there is no basis for a negotiatedpeace, the grounds for proceedings against exhortations to stop the war are stronger.11.     In selecting cases for the first prosecutions, it is desirableto show that the law is being applied impartially and that proceedings are being taken as a means of giving general warning to members of thepublic.     It is accordingly suggested that if the Attorney General isprepared to take proceedings in respect of leaflets or notices whichadvocate stopping the war, or proclaim that the war is being carried on for no good or sufficient purpose, there are no sufficient grounds ofpolicy why such proceedings should not be taken.     It would, however, bedesirable to wait a few days to see if any Communist leaflets of this character are produced, so that when proceedings are taken they may betaken in respect of Communist leaflets, Fascist leaflets, and PeacePledge Union leaflets.J.A.home OFFICE14th October, 1939.
