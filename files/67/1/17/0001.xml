The Prime Minister has nowapproved the following arrangements : -It has been decided that a number of these Committees and Sub-Committeescan be wound up or put into abeyance (see List &quot; A &quot;).It has also been decided that it would be more appropriate that a numberof Committees of the Cabinet or Sub-Committees of the Committee of ImperialDefence should be retained, not as War Cabinet Committees, but under the aegis of the Department most concerned, which would be responsible for assembling theCommittees, when necessary.   These Committees are set out in List &quot; B.&quot;The remaining Committees of the Cabinet, and Committees or Sub-Committees of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which it is decided should beretained as part of the War Cabinet organisation, together with War cabinet committees set up since the outbreak of war, are set out in List &quot; C.&quot; for convenience of reference these Committees are shown in groups according to theirsubject-matter.In a certain number of cases it has been found necessary to make adjustments in the terms of reference of these Committees. The terms of reference as soadjusted will be found in the second column of the list.Ministerial War Cabinet Committees and Chiefs of Staff Committee will,of course, report direct to the War Cabinet on matters which require decisions bythe War Cabinet. In the case of other War Cabinet Committees the procedure should be that, when the Committee desires to submit a matter for decision bythe War Cabinet, it should be submitted by the Chairman of the Committeethrough a Minister, who normally should be the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence.It may be desirable to revise the composition of some of the Committees shownm List &quot; C.&quot; As it is desired to issue a revised list of War Cabinet Committeesand Sub-Committees, showing personnel and terms of reference, as soon aspossible, Secretaries of Committees are asked, in any cases in which it appearsnecessary and desirable to do so, to confer with their Chairmen as to modification01 (a) composition, and/or (b) terms of reference, of their Committees and to notify the War Cabinet Offices (Colonel S. R. Shirley, M.C., 6 Richmond Terrace,tel. 5422), at the earliest possible date.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES, Secretary.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,September 21, 1939.[20012]R
