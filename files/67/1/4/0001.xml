THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;^---&apos; &quot; GOVERNMENT.   &apos; &quot;&quot; &apos;secret.P.(G.)(39) 4.CABINET.AFGHANISTAN:Proposed   AgreementJoint Memorandum by the Secretaries of State forForeign Affairs and for India,It has been the accepted policy of His majesty&apos;s government that the preservation of the independence andintegrity of Afghanistan as a buffer State between russia and India must be regarded as essential to thedefence of India and the Empire.   This policy wasreaffirmed by the Cabinet in 1923 and again in March1934 (CP. 9(34)).    The question how far and in whatterms we could safely and properly inform the AfghanGovernment of our policy has frequently been discussed in recent years as a result of Afghan requests for an assurance of support from us in the event of russian aggression, but for various reasons His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have not considered it desirable to enterinto too definite a commitment to the Afghan Governmentin regard to this question.    The Afghan Government were,however, confidentially informed in December 1932 thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India. would regard a Soviet attack on Afghanistan as an attack -on British and Indian interests which would force themto take the steps normally taken by the Government of aState when its interests are seriously threatened;    itwas also stated that in the event of a serious invasionCOPY NO. r?/.

of Afghan territory by Russia, and provided that suchRussian action were clearly unprovoked by any action onthe part of the Afghan Government, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared, if their previousdiplomatic intervention had failed, to break offdiplomatic and official commercial relations with theSoviet Government;   but it was added that this was thefurthest length to which His Majesty&apos;s Government wereprepared to go towards defining their attitude inadvance, and the question whether any further action could be taken, should the case arise, would depend .entirely upon circumstances at the time.2. The Afghan Government appeared to be satisfied with these assurances in 1932, but the violent changesin the world situation which have occurred since thattime, and the fate of weak nations such as Abyssiniaand Czechoslovakia have lately caused Muhammad Hashim,the Afghan Prime Minister, to renew his requests forsome more definite assurance of support by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment against aggression.   As in the past thePrime Minister still has Russia in view as the potentialaggressor, but, apart from this, it is clear from a recent despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabulthat amour propre is an important factor in influencing the Afghan Government&apos;s present desire for some form of closer association with His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Thefollowing passage, quoted from the despatch just mentioned, seems very aptly to describe their attitude in this respect:-&quot;High politics are being discussed throughoutthe world, alliances contracted and guaranteesgiven, but no mention is being made of afghanistan.   Par from being pleased at the

security implied, by such omission, the youngermembers of the Government are, I feel certain,disappointed and see in it uncalled-for neglectand a belittling of the Afghan position in world affairs.&quot;It seems evident that the Afghan desire is for some form ofagreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government which could bepublished.    It may be mentioned in this connection thatthere have been other indications recently that the AfghanGovernment no longer entertain their former fears of theeffect upon their own tribesmen and public opinion of openco-operation with Kis Majesty&apos;s Government and theGovernment of India.3. In the present war it will be very important toHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India thatAfghanistan should be on their side, at least to the extentof benevolent neutrality.   The Germans are already thelargest foreign colony in Afghanistan, and owing to their employment in various technical capacities under the AfghanGovernment they are widely distributed all over the country.It is certain that German (and probably also Italian)agents will attempt to use Afghanistan as a base for hostileactivities directed against India (as they did. in the last war) and to do everything in their power to inflame the feelings of the frontier tribes against us.    The firmco-operation of the Afghan authorities in combating   such activities would be very valuable to us.   Moreover, quite apart from the special dangers which we should have to face-in time of war, the continuous and friendly co-operation ofthe Afghan Government would be useful to us in dealing withour own tribes and in keeping the frontier peaceful.   a third consideration is that, though Muhammad Hashirn, thepresent Prime Minister, is our friend, his position, though

stronger than it was, is none too secure.   There is reasonto believe that an open assurance of support from HisMajesty&apos;s Government would greatly strengthen his position vis-a-vis his own Government and people.   This is a consideration of some importance for there is no doubt that german intrigue will be directed to undermining and ifpossible overthrowing the present regime in Afghanistan,and there is a possibility that Amanulla, the ex-King of afghanistan, might be used, perhaps with the connivance ofRussia, for this purpose.   An agreement between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Afghan Government providing   -for mutual co-operation and support might help both tostrengthen the internal position of that regime and to confirm their friendship towards us.4.        With these consid considerations in mind and afterconsultation between our two departments we addressed a telegram to His Majesty1s Minister at Kabul on 21stAugust, asking for his views on the possibility of conclud-ing a bilateral treaty with the Afghan Government on thefollowing lines:-(a) A preamble stressing the friendly relationsexisting between His Majesty1s Government in -the United Kingdom and the Government of india on the one side and the Afghan Government onthe other, and recognising their common interest in mutual security.(b) A non-aggression clause.(c) A Clause providing for mutual consultation,in the event of any international dispute orthreat of aggression likely to involve theinterests of either party, with a view toconcerting such measures of mutual assistance as might be required.(d) a Clause providing for continuous co-operation in matters of mutual concern.    (This proposalcontemplates co-operation, not only in anemergency but also in normal times, in Indo-Afghan frontier and tribal matters, the scopeof which would have to be defined - possibly by an exchange of letters - after consultationwith the Government of India.)

A copy of the telegram to Kabul is attached below,together with copies of Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler1s reply ofthe 26th August and of his subsequent telegram of 29thAugust.    It should be noted that the German-Soviet Pact ofnon-aggression was signed in the interval between thedespatch of our telegram and the receipt of the Minister&apos;reply.5. It will be seen that, while Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytlerconsiders that our proposals do not go as far as the AfghanGovernment would wish, and that they would probably like adefinite guarantee of support against aggression, he ishopeful, on the assumption that the present Russianattitude of non-aggression towards Afghanistan is notaltered by the signature of the Pact with Germany, that hecould persuade them that these proposals go to the limitthat can at present reasonably be expected.   As regards theRussian attitude, there has in the recent past been noreason to anticipate that Russia would adopt an aggressivepolicy towards Afghanistan.   But in view of possibilitieswhich might result from the Russo-German pact such an assumption can no longer be safely relied on.    Indeed, if that pact should: be followed by some form of military alliance, we should have on the contrary to take- seriousaccount of the risk of Russian aggression against Afghan-istan.   As regards the attitude of the Afghan government themselves, according to the information given in the Kabultelegram of29tlr August the present indications are thatthe effect of the German Soviet Pact has been, if anything,to increase their anxiety for closer association with and support from His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governmentof India.

6.        One very important factor which limits our abilityat the present time to undertake too definite an obligationtowards the Afghan Government is the fact that the Army inIndia is not in a position to defend Afghanistan against russia without the support of Imperial Forces, which are unlikely to be available in view of His Majesty&apos;governments&apos; numerous other commitments.   A telegram of 1stSeptember is attached from the Government of India inwhich they state their views on the proposals described inparagraph 4 above and on Sir K. Fraser-Tytler&apos;s telegram of26th August.    It will be seen that, with reference to theproposal to include a mention of mutual assistance in theagreement to be offered to the Afghan Government, theGovernment of India desire that it should be made quite clear, so far at any rate as they are concerned, that no military support by armed, forces is involved.    This is apoint of importance to which we return below.7. It will be seen, however, from the last paragraphof Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler1s telegram of 26th August, that he does not think that the Afghan Government would suggest oreven welcome any idea of a plan for military support byarmed forces from India.   In his view they would besatisfied with advice and assistance in preparing theirown forces to defend their country.   Moreover, our Ministerdoes not anticipate that the conclusion of an Anglo-AfghanAgreement on the lines suggested would in itself lead tofurther demands from the Afghan Government for financial andeconomic assistances in addition to what they are alreadyhoping to receive from His Majesty&apos;s Government and theGovernment of India as the result of proposals which arenow under consideration.

&apos;8.        In view of the extreme urgency of the international situation we would now propose, subject to the approval ofour colleagues, to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabulto make an immediate approach to the Afghan Government withan offer of a bilateral agreement on the lines sketched outin paragraph 4 above, with the following amplification.In view of His Majesty1s Minister&apos;s opinion that the AfghanGovernment would probably desire a more definite assurance of support against aggression, the proposal in paragraph4(c) above might be amplified, so as to give&apos; the AfghanGovernment a definite promise that in the. event of anemergency His Majesty&apos;s Government will not stop short atconsultation with them, but will at once proceed to thefurther step of concerting measures of mutual assistance.Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler would be at the same timeinstructed to explain orally that the measures to be takenwould have to be worked out according to circumstances andwould not necessarily involve plans for supporting theAfghan Government with our own military forces.   In thisconnection, however, we desire to draw the attention ofour colleagues to the importance of the point brought outin paragraph 6 above.    If the Afghan Government on thestrength of a clause in a written agreement providingwithout qualification for mutual assistance should at anytime request military assistance by British armed forces,any assistance of this type which it should consequentlybecome necessary to afford could not be provided from india and would consequently have to come from thiscountry or some other part of the Empire.9. At the same time, it is also proposed that our minister should give the Afghan Government orallyassurances of some measure of assistance and advice of thekind suggested in paragraph S of his telegram (as to which

the Government of India concur with certain qualificat-ions), such as some form of military mission to Kabul andsome assistance by training Afghan officers and bylending technical advisers.   The exact nature and extentof such advice and assistance as could be offered willhave to be worked out with the Government of India, whowould of course be very much concerned with this aspect of the matter.10. Moreover, if the Afghan Government raised thequestion of financial assistance at this stage, Sir KerrPraser-Tytler would be authorised to let them know that a preliminary allocation of  250,000 has been made to afghanistan under the new Export Credits Act, and thatthey could have credit to this amount a-tr-teast, regard-less of commercial considerations, for purchasing goodsin this country, including arms and munitions.    If,however, they could be induced to accept the proposedpact without raising such questions, so much the better.SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS.11. The proposals which we submit to our colleagues are that the British Minister at Kabul should be instructed on the following lines:-(1) To approach the Afghan Government immediatelywith the offer of a bilateral agreement containing(a) a preamble stressing the friendly relations between His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the Afghan Government and their common interest in mutual security,(b) a non-aggression clause,(c) a clause, or clauses, providing for mutualconsultation and for concerting measuresof mutual assistance, in the event of any international dispute or threat of aggression likely to involve theinterests of either party,

(d) a clause providing for continuousco-operation (not only in an emergencybut also in normal times) in matters of mutual concern such as Indo-Afghanfrontier questions.(2) To explain orally to the Afghan Governmentthat the measures of mutual assistance provided for in(l)(c) above would have to be worked out according to circumstances and would not necessarily involve plans for supporting the Afghan Government with our ownmilitary forces.(3) To give the Afghan Government oral assurances of our immediate willingness to give them advice and assistance in such forms as -(a) the despatch of a military mission to Kabulto advise them on their plans,(b) the training of officers of their Army andAir Force, and,(c) the loan of technical advisers.The details of such forms of advice and assistance wouldbe worked out in consultation with the Government of India.(4) To inform the Afghan Government, if theyraise the question of financial assistance but not otherwise, that a preliminary allocation of  250,000 to afghanistan has been made under the new Export Credit Act,and that they could have credit, to this amount at least,for purchasing goods in this country including arms and munitions.H.Z.7th September 1939.

72. Your despatch No.59 of 7th July and Governmentof India&apos;s telegram of 6th August, 1086.   Question offurther assurances to Afghan Government against aggression.2.        I am grateful for useful exposition of PrimeMinister&apos;s attitude contained in your despatch.   I feelthat it would be difficult to take with Afghan Governmentline suggested in paragraph 4 of Government of India&apos;telegram and for reasons of general policy I consider it essential that we should explore possibility of entering into some sort of political engagement with them.   a bilateral agreement seems preferable to a unilateralundertaking both from our own point of view and from thatof Afghan Government.   Latter if published - and I gather that some form of open assurance is what AfghanGovernment desire - would be more likely to give rise tocomplications with Soviet Government which it isessential to avoid at present juncture.   It also seems possible that a bilateral agreement might be more attractive to Afghan Government themselves on score of prestige.    In any case there are objections from military point of view to our undertaking now toodefinite an obligation in view of His Majesty&apos;governments numerous other commitments.3. We are therefore considering tentativelypossibility of bilateral agreement on following lines:-SecretCypher Telegram from Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to His Majesty&apos;s Minister,Kabul, Repeated to Government of India,dated 21st August, 1939.

(a) preamble stressing friendly relations existing between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theGovernment of India on the one side and AfghanGovernment on the other, and recognising common interest in mutual security.(b) A non-aggression clause.(c) Clause providing for mutual consultation in eventof any international dispute or threat of aggression likely to involve interests of either party with a view to concerting such measures of mutual assistance as might be required.(d) Clause providing for continuous co-operation inmatters of mutual concern.4. I should hope that a bilateral agreement on theselines which could be represented as being in general interests of &quot;peace bloc&quot; in opposing aggression by axis power would not cause any difficulty with SovietGovernment.   With reference to sub-paragraph (c) ofparagraph 3 above compare Article 3 of the Saadabad Pact.This clause would cover case of present situation vis-a-visAxis powers (for example use of Afghanistan by hostileagents as base for activities directed against India orpossibility of internal trouble instigated by Axis againstpresent regime in Afghanistan.)     Prom Afghan point ofview, it would also cover possibility of Soviet aggression against Afghanistan at some future date, though I considerchances of such aggression negligible in presentconditions and probably for many years to come.   Sub-paragraph (d) would cover co-operation in Frontier andtribal affairs generally in time of peace as well as war.5. Please telegraph your views as soon as possible(without however making any further approach to the AfghanGovernment in the matter at the moment) on suggestion of negotiating an Agreement on above lines.    In particular Ishall be grateful for your opinion on following points:-(a) Would Agreement involving only obligationsindicated above be likely to prove attractive to Afghan Government?

91*l 1SecretTelegram from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Kabul toSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, IndiaOffice, repeated to Government of India,dated 26th August, 1939.Addressed Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,repeated to Foreign Simla,   Foreign Office telegram No.72,21st August.   Anglo-Afghan Agreement.2.       Since your telegram issued German Soviet pact hasintroduced new factor into Central Asian politics.   Untilsituation is clearer it is impossible to tell what willbe Afghan reactions, but, however non-aggressive pact maybe in regard to third States, effect seems certain toincrease Afghan fear of possible aggression aimed atIndia by Soviet Government at German instigation.3.       Effect of this may be (a) to make Afghan Governmentmore than ever anxious to be for British support, or (b)to change their attitude towards establishing closer relations with Great Britain, at any rate of overt nature,for fear of exciting German and Russian hostility.4.      On assumption that they will adopt first of these-attitudes, proposals outlined in paragraph 3 of yourtelegram will not, I think, go as far as Afghan Governmentwould wish.   They would probably like definite guarantee of support against aggression.   At the same time clause(b) Do you anticipate that conclusion of such anAgreement would in itself lead to further demands for financial and economic assistance in additionto Afghan desiderata referred to in paragraph 17 ofyour despatch No.51(E) of 16th June, which is atpresent under consideration?

outlined in paragraph No.3(c) of your telegram amountsvery nearly to such guarantee and, if present Russianattitude of non-aggression is not altered by signature ofpact with Germany, I should be hopeful of persuadingAfghan Government that your proposals go to limit that can at present reasonably be expected.5. I realise however that as Russia apparently nolonger belongs to &quot;peace bloc&quot; effect on them of proposed agreement with Afghanistan may have to be further considered.6. As regards your paragraph No.5(b), I anticipate &apos;   -that in discussions, Afghan Government would require from us assurance of assistance, to be undertaken immediately on signature of Agreement, in preparing their defencesto resist aggression from the North.   Such assistance might take the form of (a) drawing up strategic plan(b) assistance in putting such plan into force, if required, by (1) training of officers of Afghan Army andAir Force; (2) supplementing their present armament, (3)loan of technical advisers on tactical dispositions, etc.7. I do not think they would suggest or welcome any idea of a plan for military support by armed forces from india nor do I anticipate that they would on the strengthof this Agreement make requests for further economic assistance in addition to.that already asked for.   But theywould require advice and assistance in preparing their own forces to defend their country and act as an advance postto the defence of India.Fraser-Tytler 76, August 26th.

SecretTelegram from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul toSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, IndiaOffice- repeated to Government of India,dated 29th August, 1939.Addressed to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsrepeated.to Foreign, Simla,   Reference paragraph No,3 ofKabul telegram No.76.2. Attitude of Afghan Government, as verified ininterview granted on 26th and 27th August by primeMinister to Air Officer Commanding in India and theDirector of Intelligence Bureau, indicates that effect ofGerman-Soviet pact has been, if anything, to increase their anxiety for closer connection with and support fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government and Government of India.Eraser--Ty tier 79.   August 29th.SecretTelegram from Government of India, External AffairsDepartment, to Secretary of State for India, repeated to Kabul, dated 1st September, 1939.1285. Addressed to Secretary of State for India, repeated to Kabul 225.Foreign Office telegram No.72 and Kabul telegramNo.76, Anglo-Afghan Agreement.2. We concur in your proposals for a bilateral agreement as set forth in paragraph No.3 of your telegrambut would prefer that clause (c) should be in the same terms as article 5 of Saadabad Agreement.    If however HisMajesty&apos;s Government and Minister at Kabul consider itdesirable that some mention of mutual assistance should beincluded we should be willing to agree provided it is madequite clear that any assistance from us will be strictly

limited to items mentioned in paragraph No.6 of Kabultelegram No.76 and that no military support by armed forces is involved.3. We will have to discuss frontier implicationsfurther with the two frontier administrations.   Subject to result of discussions our provisional view is that there isno objection to clause (d) though it will be important toobtain some definite objectives, possibly by means ofexchange of letters.   We thin]-: co-operation in frontiermatters should not be interpreted as meaning ordinarilymore than (a) exchange of information (b) measures toprevent our tribes interfering in Afghanistan and vice versa, and (c) control of refugees or other elements usingtribal territory on either side of the frontier for activities subversive of either or both contractingparties and, if necessary, removal from vicinity offrontier.In peace we anticipate that weakness of ourweapons for control of anti-Afghan propaganda in Indianpress will continue to cause embarrassment to relations.4. We concur in forms of assistance suggested inparagraph 6 of Kabul telegram No.76 subject to followingremarks:    (a) the proposals involve the despatch of some-thing in the nature of a military and air mission to Kabul.As Turks already have a mission with Afghan Army weconsider they should be taken into confidence unless, ofcourse, any serious change in our position vis-a-visTurkey is anticipated in the near future; (b) though we might be able to find necessary personnel required,armaments if required in immediate future must&apos;be supplied by His Majesty&apos;s Government as there is nothing to sparein India;    (c) so far as financial aspect of proposals isconcerned we are willing to add to Afghan fund the total of

five lakhs (repeat five lakhs) which have been contributedshort during last two years and to credit the full contribution in future years.   The incidence of any expenditure which cannot be covered by fund when sosupplemented to be met in accordance with principlesaccepted in enclosures to Despatch No.l (External) 18thJune 1936.More generally we would wish to add (a) Agreementif it is to be of real value to India should in ouropinion be published and no secret treaty.   Prom Fraser-Tytler&apos;s telegram No.79 dated August 29th 1939 it is to be hoped Afghans themselves may now desire this,(b) Assistance to Afghanistan under agreement should be understood as ordinarily covering only assistance toarmed forces of the Afghan Crown as limited in this telegram and not extending to trade negotiations or economic assistance which would be dealt with as separateissue.   To this end credits offered by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment only in so far as they can be utilised for purchase of armaments would be linked to agreement andsame would apply to our contributions from Afghan fund.Subject to further consultation with Minister we would beprepared to keep back portion of Afghan fund annually for economic assistance.   But trade negotiations would remain for settlement on basis of mutual commercial advantage.
