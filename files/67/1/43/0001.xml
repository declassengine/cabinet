piQ DOCUMENTED THEvPROPERTY OF HIS BRITANpC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT)S3CRETl,PJG) (59)45.COPY No.^4WAR CABINET.QUESTION OF THE TRANSFER TO THE UNION OF T.IE GOVERNMENT OFTHE HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES IN SOUTH AFRICA.125Memorandum .by^the. Secretary of Stateror .Somin 1 on......Af Pairs.In memoranda submitted to    the Cabinet last year(Nos, CP.28 (38) 61 (38) and ISO (38)) the position was explained in regard to the discussions and correspondence wilierhad been proceeding with General Hertaog as to the question ofthe transfer to    the Union of the Government of the high commission Territories in South Africa.It will be recalled that in the joint statement issue-by Mr. MacDonald and General Hertzog on the 29th March cf lastyear it was explained that it had been arranged that the UnionGovernment should prepare a memorandum setting out the termson &quot;which they would propose that transfer would take place ifdecided upon.    The Union Government had only finally settledthe form of this memorandum just before the outbreak of the warand after the change of Government in the Union 1 was informed by our High Commissioner that General Smuts had agreed that thepublication of the memorandun should not be proceeded with andthat the whole question of transfer should be allowed to remainin abeyance for the present.I have now however received further telegrams from thHigh Commissioner, of which copies are attached,  stating thatGeneral Smuts has asked Colonel Reitz,  the Minister for NativeAffairs,  who is now on his way to this country,  to take up withnie the question of early transfer, with special reference to thicase

144case of Swaziland.      It will be seen that General Srriuts has&quot;been partly influenced in this matter by his fear thatGeneral Hertzog will move in the Union Parliament at the next session for an Address to the King under Section 151 of theSouth Africa   Act praying for the transfer of the Territories.I had hoped that this was a matter which it wouldbe possible to avoid pursuing in&quot; present circumstances outGeneral Smuts&apos;s political difficulties will,  of course, be appreciated.      I have indicated my general views on the subject in the telegram to the High Oo.,;..iissioner of which a copy is annexed, and would propose if my colleagues agree to take theline indicated in this telegram when discussing the matter wit:-.Colonel Aeitz.      It will be seen that what is proposed is thatif General Smuts feels that the matter must be pursued,  itshould be continued on the lines previously agreed withGeneral Hertzog viz. the next step should be the publication o?the Union Government&apos;s memorandum,  so that the inhabitants of the Territories may be enabled to appreciate what the positionwould be in the event of transfer.General Smuts is evidently anxious that ho should beable to secure at least the transfer of Swaziland.      In a previous Memorandum to the Cabinet CP. 37 (197) Mr. MacDonaldpointed out that it seemed probable that the process of transfer,if and when it becomes practicable, would best be carried through in stages and that the process might begin withSwaziland,  which was formerly a protectorate of the SouthAfrican Republic,  and to which the Union Government have undoubtedly stronger historical claim than go the other two territories.      Swaziland is also the one Territory where the paramount Chief has in the past indicated that he mightpersonally be prepared to consider transfer on ter^s.      TheHigh

Richmond Terrace, 3.W. 1.19th October, 1939.High Commissioner feels that an offer on the 1ines foreshadowein the first of the enclosed telegrams is one which the Swaziswould have to consider most seriously and it would of courselease the position very greatly if there was any chance of theUnion Government offering terms which would make the idea of transfer acceptable to the natives.      It is howeveradmittedly very doubtful whether even if the Paramount Chiefhimself favoured transfer there would not remain a large bodyof native opinion in the Territory strongly opposed to suchaction.      Though I have included a warning on this point inthe telegram to the High Ccrimissionei   there seems no need to discourage the Union Government from making as attractive an offer as possible.(Intld.)

w O 8RAPHRASS TEL.SOUTH AFRICATELEGRAMFrom the High. Commissioner for Basutoland, Beohuanalandprotectorate and Swaziland.Dated 12th Oct.  1939Received 7-0 pm 12th Oct.   1939No.  123 Confidential.      Part I.Please refer to my telegram of the 19th of SeptemberNo.115.    Reitz came to see me yesterday for a talk in view ofhis early departure for the United Kingdom.    He surprised me by saying that one of the subjects which Smuts wished him to take up with you was early transfer of High Commission Territories.I had not taken it very seriously when Smuts (see telegram under reference) had spoken of war as possibly providing a convenient opportunity for proceeding with transfer, but apparently he has&quot;been turning matter over in his mind.intimated to Smuts that if no progress were made by next session, he contemplated moving in Parliament for an Addressunder Section 151 of Act of the Union (see my telegram secret no.   lhl of 18th of August)  and Smuts thought that he might now make the same motion from Front Opposition Bench in which case whole House of Assembly, irrespective of Party, could not fail to support him.    This would create a disastrous situation.On the other hand Smuts thought that during the war our Houseof Commons would take less interest in question and it shouldbe easier to put through transfer at any rate of Swaziland or possibly Swaziland and Bechuana1and protectorate.Reitz told me that Hertzcg before splittin,g had

I ventured to suggest that Smuts was mistaken on this latter point and that Members interested in Territories ^owing  d be more likely to draw ? uncomfortable contrast between our chivalrousattitude toward small nations in Europe and somewhat high harde;procedure apparently contemplated in respect of no doubt smalic-nations in South Africa.     In any case we could hardly ignoreour pledge of consultation with natives.Later in the day I had to see Smuts on another matterand mentioned my talk with Reits.    we had no time to discussthe question at length but the same points were toncned on.Smuts&apos; standpoint is naturally influenced by very great political advantage which would accrue to him if he could mikeprogress with transfer question in contrast to Hertsog&apos;srepeated failure to solve it.PART TWO FOLLOWS.

PARAPHRASE TELEGRAMSOUTH AFRICAFrom the High Commissioner for Basutoland, BechuanalandP rote c term   te and Swaziland.Dated 12th October, 1939.    Received 8.5.  p. m.   12th Oct.  1939No.   125.    Part II.I expressed our sympathies with his point of view but thought it best not to minimise difficulties.    This morningSecretary for Native Affairs came to see me and said thatReitz had been thinking over oui&apos; talk of yesteraay.    He had come to the conclusion that they must concentrate uponSwaziland and Swaziland only, since there the Union Governmentwould be able to make a really substantial contribution whichmight induce Swazis to acquiesce in transfer.    I understood from Sin it that Union Government would be prepared not only tooffer purchase of land for enlargement cf Reserves but also toconsider question of a through railway and reduction of nativetaxation.    Smit. added that Reitz would discuss matter when hewas in England from stanapoint of securing your agreement tohis entering into negotiations with Sobhuza and I promised toinform you in advance so that you might have time forreconsideration before Reitz arrives.    Obviously as matter now stands proposition is a great improvement upon what Smutsoriginally had in mind; and if when Union Government get downto details they feel able to make as generous an offer as - theyforeshadow at present it is one which Swazis would have toconsider most seriously and might one hopes accept.

Siait has been authorised by his Minister toinform Priestman that since my interview with Smit question   -was further discussed by Reitz with Smuts to-day.    Last namedwhile in general agreement with policy to concentrate onSwaziland has instructed Reitz to raise also question, of transfer of Basutoland and Bechuanaland Protectorate on theground that if His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom were faced with demand for transfer of the three Territoriesthey might find it easier to convince British public of necessity for agreeing to transfer of one as compromise solution.

y. 6/352.PARAPHRASE TELEGRAMSOUTH africa to the High Commissioner for Basutoland, the bechuanaland protectorate and Swaziland.(Sent 12 midnight, 18th October, 1939).IMPORTANT.No.144 Confidential.Your telegrams Nos.123 and 124 of 12th October.It has come as an unpleasant surprise to me that General Smutswishes to raise question of transfer again at this moment..You should let him know that I shall of course be ready todiscuss matter with Reitz but I think that you should explain to him at the same time that,  subject to the views of my colleagues whom I propose to consult before Reitz arrives,my present feeling in regard to matter is as follows.    entirely share the view which you have already expressed tohim as to the attitude of the House of Commons here and itwould certainly be wrong to assume that parliament would beindifferent to the matter if there was any suggestion of trying to make use of the present preoccupation of publicopinion with the conduct of the war to force through the transfof any of the Territories,  if there should be strong opposition from the native inhabitants.    General Smuts will appreciate that while we fully recognise the significance of Section 151of the South Africa Act our position is also governed by the pledges to Parliament and the inhabitants of the Territorieswith which he is familiar and that we could not contemplate

making any prior bargain for the transfer of Swaziland aloneas a compromise solution as seems to be suggested in yourtelegram No.124.If it is felt that in view of possible action byHertzog in the Union Parliament the question must be pursued,it ought, I think,  to be continued on the lines agreed withGeneral Hertzog and indicated in the joint statement ofMarch 1938 viz. the next step should be the publication ofthe Union Governments memorandum as to conditions on whichthe Union Government would propose that transfer should takeplace if decided upon.    It would be for the Union Governmentto consider whether they would be able to include in such amemorandum conditions in the case of Swaziland such as youmention with a view to making the idea of transfer more attractive to the inhabitants of Swaziland.    But we cannotof course guarantee that even the most favourable offer whichthe Union Government can make would not leave a large bodyof native opinion in Swaziland strongly opposed to transferor that the issue of the Union memorandum might not provokedemonstrations on the part of the natives in the three territories against transfer.I imagine General Hertzog could hardly press mattersstrongly in Union Parliament    if action was being taken on thelines indicated above (i.e. issue of Union memorandum) whichare those which he himself had previously agreed with us andhad announced.    I appreciate,  of course, General Smuts&apos;difficulties and am as anxious as he that Union opposition should not push   matters to the point of moving for an address to the King.    It is indeed only from this point of view thatI would suggest proceeding with publication of Union memorarvd;rr..,

since I am naturally anxious in present circumstances, when our activities must he so largely devoted to matters connectedwith the war,  to avoid administrative difficulties in the territories which may, I fear, result from publication of thememorandum.Subject to your observations I should like you to speak to General Smuts in this sense as soon as possible so that hemay be aware how I regard the matter before Reitz opensdiscussions here.
