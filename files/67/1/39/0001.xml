EXTRACT PROM TIE CONGLusiOSs OF THE FOURTHMEETING OF THE MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ONECONOMIC POLICY HELD OI-T 17TH OCTOBER,  1959.AT g,0 P.M.IIT THE       1.        THE COMMITTEE Had &quot;before them the conclusions reachedINDUSTRY..by the Interdepartmental Committee on Economic Policy at ameeting held the previous day (Committee Paper E.P.   (M)(39) 16) on the subject ,of wages in the coal industry,  theposition respecting which was as follows:-(i) The Mining Association had agreed in principle with the Mineworkers Federation to grantan increase in wages subject to the Governmentagreeing to a corresponding increase in thepithead price of coal;(ii) The Mining Association had not committed themselves o the amount of such increase,but had agreed that it should be determined&quot;after consideration of the increased cost ofliving51;(iii) The demand made by the Mineworkers federation was for an immediate increase of 1/- per shift(or 6do  for employees under 18);(iv) It was agreed by both owners and miners thatthe new advance should be incorporated in their normal wages system and should be merged in one form or another in any future advances whichmight result from the operation of theirexisting wage agreements^THE COMMITTEE agreed:-(a) that in view of the extent to which the Mining-Association had committed themselves in discussion with the Mineworkers Federation itwas impossible to avoid some immediate increasein wages in the coal industry;(b) that whatever increase was granted, every effort should be made to prevent it from being linkedin public with the increase in the cost ofliving;(c) that in view of the fact that the increase inthe cost of living had throughout formed the basis on which the proposed increase in wages had been discussed between the owners and the men it was essential that due consideration should be given to the following:-

The cost of living Index stood today at 165as compared with 155 at the outbreak of war -an increase of 10 points..    Of this increase.6 points was attributable to increased taxation on sugar, and this portion of theincrease in the Index should be entirelyexcluded from consideration,,      For the purposeof discussion with the Miners therefore? theincrease in the cost of living Index amountednot to 10 points but to 8 points (fractionsbeing disregarded in the Index)c      On this basis the percentage increase in the cost ofliving since the outbreak of war should bo taken as 6o      If wages in the coal industry were tobe advanced in strict proportion with this increase, an addition of 7d per shift would need to be made.that in view of the fact that (as reported that morning by the Mining Association to theSecretary for Minos) the owners proposed intheir discussions with the Minors to suggestan increase of 6d*  a shift and hoped to reach agreement on a &quot;basis of ode a shift, therewould be no Justification for letting the mine owners understand that, if necessary,  theGovernment wore prepared to advance prices topermit of the acceptance in full of the mens1demand (he,  an increase of 1/- a shift);in any communication made by the Secretary for mines to the Mining Association care should betaken to avoid giving the owners any grounds for shifting the refusal of the full demand ofthe men on to the shoulders of the Government;that at his forthcoming interview with the mining association,  the Secretary for Minos,  after having explained fully the considerationssummarised in Conclusions (a) to (c) above should proceed on the following lines:&apos;-(i) the Government wore prepared to take into account a reasonable increase in wages when fixing the new pithead price for coal, but any such increase in wages would need to be merged in any subsequentwage increase which might become due inaccordance with existing wage agreementsunder subsequent ascertainments;(ii) having regard to the fact that in thevmr of 1914 - 1918, no increase in wageswas given until January 1915, and no increase comparable to those suggestedbefore June 1915, and to the extremelygrave repercussions on industrial wagesgenerally which would result from thegrant to the coal industry of an increasein wages equivalent to 5/6d a week, andhaving regard also to the fact that

tho present difficulties were due to the actionof the Mining Association in allowing thepresent position to develop without prior consulation with the Government, it was now the Association^ duty in the national interestto secure the agreement of the MineworkersFederation to the smallest possible increasein wages in the coal industry
