I,  INTRODUCTORY,1* Tne lighting restrictions imposed at the out-break of war were the result of a long series of experimentsconducted by the Air Raid Precautions Department in conjunc-tion with the Air Staff, the railway authorities, the police(in connection with road traffic), industrial undertakings,(particularly those whose processes produce glare) and the gas and electric lighting undertakings.      The regulationscover a very wide fields since in order to secure a com-prehensive blackout it is necessary to regulate the externaland internal lighting of buildings and the lighting requiredfor transport both by railway and road.      In approaching this problem it is therefore of especial importance to realise that the lighting restrictions should be judged as a whole,since they are all directed to a single purpose and many ofthem are interdependent.      For example, the intensity ofthe lighting of vehicle lamps and traffic signs has been fixed at a level which/sufficient against a background of a completely blacked-out street..      If street lighting of any appreciable intensity were permitted immediate adjustment of the intensity of vehicle lights would have to be made.The standard then necessary for vehicles would not be lowenough if street lighting were extinguished on receipt ofan air raid warning.2. The restrictions undoubtedly cause loss of life,dislocation and inconvenience.    On the other hand there is evidence that in many parts of the country even the existingrelaxations which have been permitted for special reasonsarouse resentment on the part of the public and we believethat public opinion, which has been firmly impressed with theview that the restrictions are an essential element in thedefence of the country from air attack, would be more thana little puzzled if these restrictions were substantiallyrelaxed when there has not been even one night raid.-1-

II.    SURVEY OF LIGHTING RESTRICTIONS.3&quot; In the following paragraphs we set out thepresent position as regards each of the various classesof lighting restriction,, indicating under each head theextent to which these restrictions have either been modifiedsince the outbreak of war or shoulds in our view9 now be modified.(a) lighting restrictions in relationto supply problems.(i) Internal lighting in factories.4. The restrictions on the internal lighting of factories and similar buildings imposed at the outbreak ofwar led to certain difficulties, mainly of a local ortransitional character.      Difficulties under thefirst head,  affecting production by day9 can be met by thecomplete exclusion of daylight9 coupled with an efficientsystem of artificial light.      Where this course has beenadopted the results obtained have been satisfactory.Difficulties of the second class, affecting night work,are mainly temporary in character, being due to the factthat on the outbreak of war manufacturers had not completed their screening arrangements and were forced for the moment to fall back on temporary screening devices.     Where completeexclusion of daylight is for some reason impracticable,, theuse of removable shutters of approved types constitutes asatisfactory substitute.5. Special problems are presented by industrialprocesses involving the use of furnaces and other plantsthe employment of which produce a glare visible from a great

distance.      These processes are generally continuous,and cannot be shut down at nigh-,.      Suitable measures todeal with these problems are3 howevers in process ofadoption on lines agreed upon by the Air Raid PrecautionsDepartment and the industries concerned.(ii) External lighting for buildingarid QtnBr cojistructionaT&quot;wd&quot;fE.6&quot; Provision was made in lighting instructions issued on the outbreak of war to enable urgent constructional workof vital national importance to be carried on out-of-doorsduring the hours of darkness0      For this purpose reducedlighting was permitted, provided that, it   was properlyscreened and was capable of being switched off on receiptof an air raid warning.      The power to authorise speciallighting of this kind rests with the police;  and it is pos-sible that in the first- few weeks of the war the police mayhave been too sparing in the grant of these authorisationssbeing influenced often no doubt by the strong local public feeling against any relaxation.      Since our appointment afurther scheme permitting restricted lighting has beenagreed upon by the Government Departments concerned and circulated to all Government contractors.      It is believedthat this scheme will provide sufficient lighting in allcases except possibly those where certain fine work has tobe carried out at night.        To meet this contingency9arrangements have been made to consider applications forthe grant of permission to use temporarily even higher standards of lightings in order to make up arrears in cer-tain processes.70 Relaxations in the regulations described abovehave on our recommendation been applied not only to muni-tions factories and similar works but also to the lightingof other constructional undertakings of vital nationalimportance9 e.g.  the building of hospitals9 wheat silos, etc.

(iii) Light on proofing ranges.8. Considerable difficulty was experienced   at the outset ofthe war in the use of proofing ranges at night owing to the lighting restrictions imposed.      In this case also a revised scheme has been drawn up and sent for comment to the rangesconcerned.      No criticisms have since been received, and it may therefore be assumed that the proposed standards of lightinghave met with general approval.(h) Lighting restrictions in relation to railway Transport.(i)    Lighting of passanger trains.9. The very low standard of lighting permitted in railwaycarriages has undoubtedly caused great discomfort and hardship to passengerSo      The whole question has been examined in great detail since oar appointment and as a result a scheme hasbeen devised by which,  subject to suitable safeguards, it isproposed that in main line trains carriages should be lightedwith a white light by means of which passengers will be able to read with reasonable comfort.      This scheme which has been worked out by the Railway Lighting Committee should, whenadopted, meet existing grievances.10.       The Railway Lighting Committee state - and we agree -that it will not be possible to extend this concession tosuburban trains since owing to the large number of stations at which such trains stop there would be an inevitable escapeof light through the raising of blinds and the opening ofdoors.      It is, however, proposed to take steps to bring the lighting of all such trains up to the permitted maximum(.006 foot candles).      The general use of lighting on this scale will greatly reduce the discomfort of suburban trains.It will still however not be possible for passengers to read.-k-

(11) Lighting in passenger stations,goods sheds and motive power sheds.11.       The standard of lighting permitted in railway stationsis, in general, adequate for normal conditions.      There might,however, he a certain risk in the event of foggy weatheriExperiments should therefore he made in foggy conditions tofind a suitable form of lighting by actual tests conducted in conjunction with the Air Staff.12.        Considerable difficulty has been encountered under present conditions in the handling at stations of parcels,mails, etc.     Vv&apos;e think that this difficulty could best be overcome by the use at suitable points of the standard of lighting permitted in exceptional cases for outdoorbuilding work (Category &quot;C&quot; lighting standard).13.        Somewhat similar problems arise in the case ofgoods sheds and motive power sheds.      In these cases also it might be necessary exceptionally to authorise the use ofadditional lighting points of Category &quot;0&quot; power.lb..       No relaxation of the regulations in cases of the kinddiscussed above should be permitted except after agreement has been reached between the various departments concerned and the Air Staff.(iii) Lighting in marshalling yards.15.        Widespread and cumulative delay has occurred in thework of the marshalling yards in the railways as theresult of lighting restrictions.      On our suggestionarrangements were therefore made for experiments to be made inconjunction with the Air Staff to ascertain whether floodlighting of reduced intensity might be resumed.      Thisexperiment showed, however, that the use of the lowest form

of flood lighting whish would he of use to the railwaysprovided a light visible from the air at a distance of16 miles at an elevation of 5,000 feeto16.       We are unamimous, therefore, in considering    *that flood lighting cannot be permitted.17.       We have considered also the possibility thatmarshalling yards situated at distances of 60 or 70miles inland from East coast, might be allowed a higher standard of lighting provided that such lighting wasextinguished on receipt of^an air raid warning.Arrangements on these lines would mean that thepreliminary yellow warning, which has hitherto been treated as a confidential warning, would automaticallybecome a public warningo     For this and other reasonsadvanced by zhe Air Staff we do not consider that asolution on these lines is practicable.18.     At the present time the railways are notin fact making use of the maximum amount of lightpermitted (Category &quot;C&quot; standard), and we have accordinglyinvited the Minister of Transport to approach therailway companies, through the Railway Executive Committee,to ensure that full advantage is taken of the permittedmaximum either by increasing the standard of lightingemployed or by securing a better distribution of light through an increase in the number of posts.(c) Lighting restrictuions in relation to road Transporto(i) Street, lightingo(1) The possibility of extinguishing lightingon receipt of an air raid warningeither&quot;by means of a central &quot;control orby TheT use of Light Wardens *19.        The restrictions on street lighting and on lightingin shops and premises adjoining the street not only help to fulfil the purposes of the blackout as required by the

Air Staff &quot;but are intended to discourage the presence oflarge numbers of people in the streets at night timeoThis has throughout &quot;been a fundamental element in air raidprecautions policy     At first the unfamiliar conditionsproved dangerous &quot;both to vehicles and pedestrians, and tomeet this difficulty the restrictions were relaxed by allow-ing more light to be used in headlamps and shielded torchesto be used by pedestrianso20.       We have given careful consideration to a suggestionthat it might be possible to permit a much higher degreeof street lighting provided that arrangements could bemade for such lighting to be switched out on receipt of an air raid warningo     We find that over the greater part ofthe country the control of electric lighting by a masterswitch can only be secured if. an..elaborate system -of r*elayswitches-were..i-ns.tal.led or a separate set of new mains laid,while as regards gas lighting it would be possible forthis to be extinguished from a central point only in thoseplaces where the system of gas distribution is abnormallysimple.       In the case of London,  it would be impossibleto switch off gas lighting in the streets without at thesame time switching off gas for all industrial and domestic purposes, unlenas- expenditure running into many millions of pounds was incurred in laying a spearate^gas mainsystemo      In existing conditions,  therefore, it would onlybe possible to switch off street lighting on receipt ofan air raid warning by employing a very large number ofpersons standing by on duty throughout the hours ofdarknesso      It has been calculated that there areapproximately 800,000 standards distributed throughout thecountry; that at least half of these would be required to

be kept alight;    that it would not be possible for a LightWarden to extinguish more than 10 lights in the time available;    and consequently that to adopt such a systemit would be necessary to employ whole time a body of about40,000 men at an average wage of probably not less than 3. a weeks21.        Quite apart from the objections indicated about,the Air Staff would be strongly opposed to any such arrangement since a degree of lighting in a built-up areaof sufficient intensity to be of any real value wouldmake the area visible to hostile aircraft 40 miles away.The Red Air Raid warning is given when aircraft are 12minutes away (or 48 miles in the case of aircraft flying at240 m.p.)o      After allowing for the time required to distribute the warning the average margin is between 5 to 7minutes.       Thus enemy aircraft would be within 20   or30 miles of a given town before it would be possible to begin to switch out the street lighting, a margin   much toonarrow for safetyo      It might, of course, be possible to begin to extinguish street lighting on the Yellow signal(when aircraft were 60 or 70 miles away), but this would destroy the confidential character of the Yellow warning.The objections already urged as regards the lighting   ofrailway marshalling yards in paragraph 17 above, would apply with even greater force in the case of street lighting.22.       For the foregoing reasons we consider that thesuggestion to permit the use of lighting of higherintensity which would be extinguished on the approach of enemy aircraft must for the present be abandoned,not only on account of its prohibitive cost

but also on account of   the dangers which would be involved.(2) Experiments in the use of diffusedlighting of low intensity,,23. In the hope of devising a form of street lightingsubstantially better than that now in force, and yet on theother hand free from objection from the point of view of theAir Staff, we arranged for experiments to be carried outin the use of diffused lighting of an intensity low enoughto render it unnecessary for it to be extinguished on receipt of an air raid warning0     This experiment wascarried out over a section of the Great West Road, the intensity chosen being 0002 foot candles at ground level (the intensity of lighting allowed for railway stationplatforms).      Ground observation showed that lighting ofthis intensity sufficed to enable pedestrians to find their way across the road without discomfort, while it wasnot so intense as to render ineffective the aids tomovement (e.g. traffic lights, etc.) at present installedor to make it difficult for motorists to drive by means oftheir masked head-lights,,     The results of obscrvefcion ofthis experiment from the air were disappointing, since itwas found that the road so lighted could be readilydistinguished at 6,500 feet at a distance of between 4 or 5miles when the road was dry, and of 2 to 3 miles when it was wet.The Air Staff are of the opinion, which we accept, that if a town, of any considerable size were lighted on this scaleit would be recognisable from the air, with the result thatthe pilot of an enemy aircraft might not only be able to fix his position but also to bomb the town.     the installation of lighting on this scale in limited areasonly would create a patchwork effect which would not onlybe of no value, but would be positively embarrassing todrivers.m*ftHTrrn m

24. We do not exclude the possibility that further exper-ience may permit some relaxation of the existing restrictionson street lighting but we should not fed justified in recommending any such relaxation at present,,25, The lighting restrictions placed on motor vehicles have necessarily been rigid, since such lightingaffords one of the most distinctive marks for a pilot.      Therelaxations recently introduced have, however, given the motor driver a much better light and one sufficient toenable him to see his way,      A suitable and inexpensivemask for head-lights has been designed, and it is hopedthat by the middle of next month approximately 500,000of these masks (representing about 50 per cent, of the total requirements) will be on the market.     When these masks areavailable, drivers will know exactly how much light is permitted, and the present tendency to use less thanthe full amount should disappear.      In the meanwhile, wethink it important to secure that the existing regulations should be better understood, and we have accordinglyarranged for the circulation of an explanatory memorandumboth to automobile associations and also to the organisationsrepresenting garage proprietors, so that these bodiesmay be in a position to give advice to their clients,26, We have considered whether it is desirable to lay down a general rule on the question whether the maskedhead-light should be carried on the near side or the offside of a vehicle, but we have reached the conclusionthat it would be best to leave the position of thehead-light open to choice as at present. We havegiven consideration also to the question of the grantof special concessions for the lighting of Service vehicles

and vehicles engaged on emergency duties.       As regards theformer, we have agreed that in an emergency the military officer in charge of a column of vehicles should have authority to increase the light of the leading vehicleand the Home Secretary has agreed with the Secretary ofState for War what rank   an officer should hold before being empowered to take such action.     Similarly, the HomeSecretary, in consultation with the Departments concerned,is preparing a list of exceptions to the lighting restrictions to be made in favour of civil vehicles engaged on emergency duties (e0g. fire engines, ambulances etc.). .(d)    Lighting of internment camps.27. There was a certain amount of criticism at thebeginning of the war as to the lighting of camps containinginterned German subjects which the inhabitants of the districts concerned regarded as excessive.     arrangements have since been made by the War Office to close a certainnumber of the camps in question, but in may be necessaryto reopen them later028, We have also considered the question whether   inorder to guard against -the excape of prisoners- the diffusedlighting of the perimeter of internment camps should or    ??:;&quot;should not be extinguished during an air raid.      It hasnow been agreed that   where internment camps are situated in the more remote parts of the country, the lighting shouldbe extinguished on receipt of a yellow warning.     other arrangements are being made by the Military Authorities toprevent the excape of internees while the lighting is extinguishodc

III.    SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL conclusions and RECOMMENDATIONS.29.     We submit for consideration by the War Cabinetthe following summary of our principal conclusions andrecommendations.     Whilst we feel that no conclusions can be  final and that the position must he kept under constant review, we are of opinion that it would he unwise torecommend an extensive change at the moment when the war situation is as uncertain as it is torday.(a) Principal Conclusions.30.     We summarise our principal conclusions as follows:-(i)   The object of the blackout ordered on theoutbreak of war is to make it as difficultas is reasonably practicable for enemy aircraft attacking this country to find orto identify their objectives;    to force them,to follow natural land-marks (e.g. the Thames)so that defence may be. centred on those areas;to induce enemy aircraft to fly low ifprecision bombing is to be attained;    and ingeneral to make it impossible for aircraft to fix their position accurately;(ii)    The various lighting restrictions now in force should be judged as a whole, since they are alldirected to securing the objectives indicatedin (i) above, and many of them are inter-dependent ;(iii)    The objection to the present blackout is thatit slows up to some extent the productive&quot;--processes and the transport system of thecountry;    it affects adversely retail and commercial business in various ways;    it gives rise to unemployment in certain industries(e.g. the catering and entertainment industriesetc.);    and in general it causes a great dealof inconvenience to members of the public ofall classes, and tends to have an adverse effect upon the morale of the people;(iv)   As a result of our survey, we have been able tomake suggestions for the relaxation of the lighting restrictions in various directions,and these suggestions have been accepted bythe Departments concerned.     The most important of these modifications are those directed to:-(a) speeding up constructional work on buildings of vital national importance by the relaxation in urgent cases of theregulations in regard to external lighting;(b) removing some of the handicaps imposed onthe railways by the blackout either by the relaxation of certain of the regulationsrelating to external lighting or by

ensuring that full advantage is taken ofthe standard of lighting already permitted,e^ojgo in marshalling yards, goods sheds, etc.;(v)    The relaxation of the regulations regardingthe lighting of passenger carriages on mainline trains to an extent sufficient to permit of reading, which we propose should now he approved, will remove the most serious ofthe inconveniences hitherto caused to the travelling public by the blackout.(b) R e cpmme ndationsa31.     We summarise our recommendations as follows(a) We recommend that, subject to the relaxationsindicated in Conclusions (iv) and (v) above and others of a minor character indicated inthe body of our report, the existing lighting restrictions should for the present remain.inforce.      In submitting this recommendation,we think it right to emphasise our view thatthe present appears to be a particular^inappropriate moment at which to authorise thefurther- relaxation of. regulations expresslydevised to secure the safety of the country from air attack;(b) We recommend that the present Committee shouldbe retained in existence for the purpose ofcarrying out a review of the position at alater date in the light of developments inthe intervening periodsINITIALLED ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEESo HoChairman,Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1017th October, 1939,
