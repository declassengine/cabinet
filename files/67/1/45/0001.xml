/DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)R S T.59)45. COPY NQc     3^4war cabinet.RESTRICTION OP IIviPORTS PROM THEUNITED STATES AND CANADA.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. The Canadian Government has just decidid to raise a loan in its own market and to use part of the proceeds to repay their largest outstanding sterling loan in thiscountry, viz, the Dominion of Canada 5-g- per cent stock1930/1950,    The result will be to provide us with some 20 million worth net of Canadian dollars.This is rather more than we had hoped in the way of immediate financial help from Canada.    It is clear that little more can be done along these particular lines, and certainly not for six months or so.2* Our unfavourable balance in the first year of the warwith Canada is likely to be at least  70 million and probably 90 million,    ^hus after using up the  20 million stock of dollars referred to in paragraph 1, we should have to find some  50 to  70 million gold to pay for our purchases inCanada in the first year (and certainly much larger quantities of gold in the second year).We have proposed to Canada that for the present weshould pay for our purchases by putting sterling to the credit of the Bank of Canada in London and we have promised if they agree to guarantee them a rate of exchange for such sterlingso that they cannot lose when the sterling is ultimatelyconverted to dollars.    The means by which the Canadian&apos;ssterling balance would be liquidated would be left for future consideration but it is our hope that they would be

content to keep a large balance here throughout the war(the operation being then equivalent to a loan by canada to us),,We have not yet got the Canadian replyD3o There are two other matters at present underdiscussion of interest to the two Governments,,In the first place, Canada is anxious for internalreasons that we should place large immediate orders forCanadian wheat0    The difficulty here is one of price, thecost of Canadian wheat being considerably higher than thatof wheat which can be obtained from the Argentine.    strong representations have recently been received in telegrams from. backward Mackenzie King to the Prime Minister to the effectthat our failure to purchase on a scale comparable to our normal annual requirements, while we are purchasingcontinuously from neutral countries,  is not only causingeconomic difficulty but is exciting very undesirablecriticism in Canada of our purchasing policy.    A reply was sent by the Prime Minister on the 17th October explainingour difficulties as to prices and exchange and holding outthe prospect of our making substantial purchases of canadian wheat provided that price difficulties can be adjusted.4C The other point of difficulty is that of restriction of imports from Canada into this country.    In order to conserveour foreign exchange resources,  it is essential that weshould drastically cut imports of unnecessary goods into thiscountry and since the Canadian dollar is essentially&quot;difficult&quot;, severe restrictions have been imposed on certainimports from Canada,,    We are now anxious to cut down theimport of Can pdipn p-oples, the season for which is now coming into full swingoThe War Cabinet decided in principle that this shouldbe done, but also decided that &quot;no further action should betaken to give effect to this decision as regards the

restriction of imports from Canada and the United States,until the question of imports from Canada could be considered in connection with the negotiations on wider financial issuesshortly to begin in Ottawa&quot;0The imports of apples from Canada normally amount to between  lg-- 2 million from Canada and between  l- l-g- million from the United Statesc    The apples are now coming in, probablyat the rate of  500,000 or so a month.5. If Canada agrees to lend us the balance dr.. her favouras suggested in. par-a graph 2 above,  it might be wise to meet herby taking at least a substantial portion of her apples in thefirst year, this being a trade of some internal political importance to Canada, but no justification is seen for continuing to import apples on this scale from the UnitedStates of America,,    The Ministry of Food assure us that in viewof the large home apple crop,  there is no urgent need for theseimportsaAccordingly I consider that it would now be right to vary the deci^dxiXLjaf^jthe d4far^Jj.abdnet--quoted above-to the - - extents,of placing apples and pears on the Import Prohibition list.It is, however,  regarded as most important in theinterests of our relations with Canada,  certain sections ofwhich will be seriously affected by these and other restrictionsdictated by the exchange position,  that a short interval shouldbe allowed for telegraphic consultation with the canadian government.    It would be explained to the Canadian Governmentthat there is no alternative to talcing this step at a very early date (say 1st November) but that we should greatly prefer,before announcing it,  to have reached agreement on the amounts which we shall be able to admit.    We should invite their acceptance of a reduction by (say) 50 per cento of the importsof apples and pears from Canada during the remainder of thepresent season,  in comparison with the same period of thepreceding season.    We should also tell the Canadian Government

that we should, much prefer it if they could arrange forthe restriction to be effected at the exporting end inCanada as an alternative to the rationing of individualimporters in the United Kingdom,,It is suggested that imports from the United Statesof America should be prohibited entirely and it would nodoubt lessen the blow to Canada if we are in a position totell them in-confidence that in the case of United States,,apples and. pears, we are proposing to impose total prohibition.,    It is desirable that the draft aide memo irewhich is attached,  should be handed to Mr&amp; Kennedy before this is d.one(Initialled)    J.S.Treasury Chambersx S.W01019th October, 1939.

DRAFT AIDE hEMOIRE TO BE HiJTDED TO U. S.  AIIBaSSADOR BY THECHAI-ICELLOR AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRi.DE.As you know, we have heen compelled, in order to concentrate the dollar resources available to us on the purchaseof commodities essential for the prosecution of the war, to prohibit the importation, except under licence, of a largevariety of goods.2, Further consideration of the position has led us tothe conclusion that it will be necessary in the near future toplace drastic restrictions on the purchases of other productionswhich are of great importance in the normal trade of the UnitedStates with this country, including fruit (fresh apjples andpears and tinned fruit), and tobacco.      It may be necessary to cut down imports of oranges from the United States, when the next season&apos;s crop is ready, and purchases of dried fruits may haveto be much reduced.      There is also the question of Filmroyalties, which is a matter of great importance both to youreconomy and ours.      we are examining this and hope that some arrangement will be found possible which will take account ofthe interests of both countries,3. As regards tobacco, we shall not be able to providedollars for further purchases of leaf tobacco for manufacture inthis country, except to fulfil pre-war contracts.      As you are aware, our tobacco companies hold large stocks of Americantobacco.      Oriental tobacco constitutes a special problem as,for political reasons, we may be unable to avoid takingsubstantial quantities.k* As regards fruit, whether fresh or preserved, theintention is that importation should be restricted to the

minimum requirements of the United Kingdom, which, in the caseof apples in particular are likely to he very small thisseason, owing to the large home crop.5. You will appreciate that our action is dictated solelytoy necessity having regard to the state of our dollar resources.Our orders in respect of essential supplies which must toe paid for in dollars are &quot;bound to toe very large.     In thesecircumstances it is inevitatole that purchases of less-essential items should toe restricted.6. You may rest assured that it is in no way our intention that the reduction of imports from the United States, whichis forced upon us by the war, should toe used for the purpose of altering permanently the channels of trade;    and that we intendas soon as may toe possible to return to our normal peace-timecommercial policy as enshrined in the. .Trade Agreement with theUnited. States.
