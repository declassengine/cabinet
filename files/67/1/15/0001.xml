[8 rogiHl^l1&apos;--18 THE PRQPBRIIiy QF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT,COPY WO.P.(G)(39) 15.WAR   G A B I Nvl T.MERC HANT S Hip\ COftSTRUC TI ON.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1.    I desire to bring before ray colleagues the questionof the construction of merchant vessels on government account.2.    In the year 1936 a special committee consisting ofAdmiralty and Board of Trade representatives was set up bythe Supply Board to prepare shipbuilding plans for war time,i.e. plans for utilizing the - available capacity of privateshipbuilding yards for naval and commercial ship construction in time of war.3.    The Committee&apos;s recommendations took final shapeearly this year and as the outcome of their report to theSupply Board the Committee of Imperial Defence in a letterlast May (19/14/4/2) invited the Board of Trade to take such steps as might be necessary to enable orders formercantile vessels on the lines visualised by the Committeeto be placed quickly after the outbreak of war.4.    The Committee had determined in advance the mostsuitable types of mercantile vessels to be built, viz.tankers, cargo liners, tramps, colliers and coasters.    plans of the vessels to be built and of their mcchinery have beenprepared in consultation with the shipbuilders to whom thework is to be allocated,  and with the marine engineerswhere the shipbuilders themselves are not providing themachinery.    The allocation of yards has been settled in collaboration v/ith the Admiralty.

5. The plan provides for the construction of about1,100,000 tons of merchant shipping in the first year afterthe outbreak of war whether on private of Broarj of TradeAccount,      At the time at which the Supply Board had givenconsideration to the problem, the amount of merchantship building in the yards had seriously fallen off, but to asubstantial extent this has been remedied as the result of theproposals for assistance to British shipping by means of loans and grants for shipbuilding outlined by me in the House ofCommons on 28th March,  1939 (Cmd, 6060, presented in July 1939).6, In the result,  on the outbreak of wax&apos; there were on order or under construction in British shipyards a total of about730,000 tons of useful cargo-carrying shipping, but this included little  tanker tonnage,      (There were also on order orunder construction some 200,000 tons of little value for cargocarrying in wartime,  e.g, 85,000 tons represented by the&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;),      Immediately on the outbreak of war Iauthorised this total to be increased by placing orders onBoard of Trade account for a total of about 100,000 tons ofshipping at an estimated cost of  2-g-/3 million, and to this theChancellor of the Exchequer lias agreed,7. In view of the policy of the War Cabinet that departments are to lay their plans on the assumption that the war will last for three years,  it appears to me necessary that a further200,000 tons to bring the amount of shipbuilding output in thefirst year of war to a minimum requirement of 1 million tonsshould be put in hand at once at a cost of approximately afurther , 5 to  6 million.8. A   decision is urgently required,  as(a)  shipbuilders must place their orders for material atleast some time in advance of the date when the keel is actually laid.      If ouch orders are not given by them now,  itmay be found that material is being diverted to other war purposes:.

(b) builders of marine engines do not necessarilyconfine their activities to this type of productions, and unlessthe merchant shipbuilding programme, is maintained at thehighest possible point,  it will be found that the plant orskilled labour of the firms earmarked for building marineengines is no longer available for that purpose.9. Unless the orders are placed at once, not only willvaluable time be lost in making good shortage occasioned by submarine sinking and diversion of ships to the use of thedefence services but when orders are ultimately placed theremay already have come into being a diversion of labour and materials to other war purposes with consequential slowing upin the replacement of ships lost.10. The Admiralty and the Board of Trade are in close touch to ensure that orders for new construction are placed insuch a way as to make the best use of the labour and materialsavailable, on the allocation referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5,11. It would be of assistance in framing plans well inadvance if the principle of maintaining an annual output of notless than 1,100,000 tons gross of shipping whether on commercial or Board of Trade account could be approved by the War Cabinet,subject to my obtaining the Chancellor&apos;s approval as and when am of opinion that a further instalment of Board of TradeI orders should be placed.       As at present advised I regard thisI annual output as really below the safety margin but it isi i  considered unlikely that the labour available can cope with ailarger output.O.F.G.S.rd of Trade.19th September, 1939.
