I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to a proposal which hasbeen made to hold trials in conjunction with the French in Algeria of thespraying of real mustard gas from aeroplanes.2. During the Anglo-French Technical Conference held in July last, theFrench were informed that the British, had perfected a method of spraying fromhigh altitudes, but, since lack of space prevented it, they had not been ableactually to spray mustard gas itself. The British trials had&apos;been carried out witha substitute chemical whose physical properties are akin to mustard gas and, fromthe behaviour of this, and from comparative laboratory tests with mustard gas,the British are satisfied that mustard gas can equally well be sprayed.3. The French had failed to evolve a satisfactory method of emission ofspray from aircraft. The French delegation witnessed a demonstration ofspraying with the substitute chemical and satisfied themselves that we had solvedthe technical difficulties.They remained, however, unconvinced without actual trial that mustard gassprayed from high altitudes would behave in the same physical manner as thesubstitute and would also retain its virulence when it reached the ground. Onlya spraying trial with mustard gas can establish conclusive proof,The French have offered facilities in Algeria for this trial,4. By agreement reached at the Conference, the French have been givensamples of our spray container for fitting to their own aircraft.5. Both parties are agreed on the urgency of these spraying trials. TheFrench High Command have expressed their agreement that British aircraft should be used for the purpose in Algeria.This course would produce the quickest and most conclusive proofs of theBritish development, i would therefore urge my colleagues to sanction thesetrials by British aircraft in Algeria, even if their presence there may be thought:to have certain political drawbacks.6. Should, however, these political considerations pre&apos; hide the courseadvocated, the French consider that preliminary trials at Porton with twoFrench aeroplanes will be required, one fitted with a spray apparatus of Frenchdesign, the other fitted with a British apparatus.The better combination would thereafter carry out the trials in Algeria,7. The production of a satisfactory design is an intricate business of whichthe French have little experience, and it is^unlikely that we should be able to fit:an apparatus to a French machine or satisfy ourselves of the efficiency of theFrench apparatus in the short time available before 1st November, the date by which the French have asked for the trials to be completed. modifications to designs will be necessary and weather is a factor,
It is of first importance that rm^leading results should not be obtained,since the French judgment might be adversely affected thereby.All reports tend to confirm that the Germans are likely to use gas in the nearfuture, and spraying from aircraft may well prove a most potent weapon against which we have reason to believe that the Germans are not well protected.Early confirmation of our technique is therefore most important for bothourselves and the French.On this account and for the technical reasons given I trust that my colleaguescan sanction the use of British aircraft for these trials in Algeria.The War Office,19th October, 1939.(b39/8)   80   10/39   w.o.p.   3945
