(THIS WCWaMT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY13 GOVERNMENT. )COPY no war CABINET.RECOVERY FROM PARENTS OP COST OP BILLETINGSCHOOL CHILDREN.First Report by the Civil Defence Committee.At their meeting held this morning,  the civil defence Committee had under consideration joint proposals submitted by the Minister of health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland on the question of the recovery fromparents of the cost of billeting school children.2. Under these proposals, County Councils and CountyBorough Councils of evacuating areas in England and Wales(and corresponding bodies in Scotland) will be called uponto make available the services of their officers for the assessment and recovery from parents and other personsliable, of contributions towards the cost of the billetingof, and of the provision of medical attention for, un-accompanied school children.    The necessary directions willbe embodied in circulars to be issued to the localauthorities concerned,,3. On the basis of the present billeting fees,  it isproposed that a contribution of 6/- per week in respect ofeach child (which represents two-thirds of the cost)should be regarded as the standard charge repayable.Those persons who are in a position to pay the full chargeof 9/- per week will be invited to do so, but it is pro-posed that a payment of C/   or upwards should be accepted as a full discharge of the legal obligation involved.

4. The proposed circular lays down a national- -Seals on&apos; the basis of which the amounts recoverable are to be assessed.    It contains provision also for the establishmentof machinery by which the parent or other person concernedcan appeal against assessments made by the officers of thelocal authorities.5. The details of the scheme have been submitted in confidence to the English and Scottish Local GovernmentAssociations concerned and also to the London CountyCouncil.    Subject to certain amendments, which have nowbeen incorporated in the scheme, these bodies regard theproposals as satisfactory.    Informal consultations havealso been held with representatives of the opposition parties in Parliament, who have expressed concurrence inthe scheme, though they anticipate that in some localitiesit will meet with considerable opposition.6. Without allowing for the cost of collection (whichit is expected will amount to between 15 and 20 per cent),it is anticipated that the gross amount which will bereceived under the scheme will be  -3,600,000 per annum.7. We realise that the present proposals will probably have some repercussions on the evacuation scheme and inparticular     may accentuate the tendency of parents tobring their children back to their homes in evacuationareas.   We consider, however, that this disadvantage ismore than outweighed by the importance of recovering thecosrfc   of billeting from parents in accordance with their ability to pay.    We are impressed also by the strength ofthe feeling in favour of recovery entertained by house-holders on whom children of comparatively well-to-doparents have been billeted.

8ichmond Terrace, S.W,1,3rd October, 1939u8. We are agreed that the scheme    Should be broughtinto operation as soon as may be practicable, but a numberof considerations need to be weighed before deciding the exact date as from which the liability to pay shouldcommence,    While clearly there should be no unnecessarydelay3  it is important to allow sufficient time for theLocal Authorities to make their administrative arrange-ments and for this coming demand to be grasped by the parents concerned.9. At this morning&apos;s meeting of the Committee, it wasagreed that the precise date as from which the liability of parents should commence should be the subject of -further discussion between the Treasury and the other Departmentsconcerned,    This discussion has since been held, and,subject to Ministerial approval in each case,  theDepartments have now agreed that, providing the proposedcirculars are issued to-morrow (Wednesday, 4th October,1939) the date from which the liability of parents shouldcommence should be Saturday, 28th October, 1939.10.        In view of the possibility that the scheme mayarouse some controversy, we think it right to submit itto the War Cabinet for final approval.    For the reason explained, the matter should be regarded as urgent, and we accordingly recommend that the War Cabinet should authorise the immediate issue of the necessary instructionsto &quot;f&quot;-^0 Lor-n   Authorities concerned.ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE:(Cigned)    JOHN ANDERSON.Chairman.
