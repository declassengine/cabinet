(This document is the Property of. His B/Britannic Majesty&apos;s^ Government.Copy Ho.W.P.(G)(39) 21W A RCA B I H K TINDIA AND &apos;J.Hfi WANMemorandum by the fyooretary or Ktate for India.In the opening sections of the first report for myDepartment submitted to the War Cabinet, the hope was expressed that, although there had been a general tendency in Indian political circles since the crisis a year ago to repudiate any idea that India would submit to beingembroiled in an &quot;imperialistic war&quot;, nevertheless india would, in fact, co-operate unconditionally in the prosecution of the war.   Unfortunately events of the past three weeksshow this forecast to have boon unduly optimistic.Although there appears to be Little doubt, that the genera]trend of public opinion in India is still strongly anti-Naziand in full sympathy with the Allied aims, the working committee of the Indian National Congress, disregarding thecounsels of Mr. Gandhi, issued on 15th  September a lengthystatement the effect of which was, before committing theCongress to a policy in relation to the war, to demand fromHis i/ia j eg ty&apos; s Government a statement or their war aims intheir application to India, with the implication that unless this produced a satisfactory response Indian co-operation inthe war would be withheld.     I attach as Annexure A to thismemorandum a telegraphic summary of this very long document.The fir fit reactions to this statement, even iningress circles, was a very widely felt disapprobation, ontoe ground that this was no time for bargaining.    It was

commonly believed that the main purpose of the statement was to placate the more extreme Left-wing elements in theCongress, and that its authors would be content if it were taken at a good deal less than its face value.   Inparticular it appears certain that the Congress Ministries,at all events in the more important Provinces, are strongly of this opinion and, being all anxious to play their partin prosecuting the war with vigour, would obey mostreluctantly - though they probably would obey - any instructions they might receive from the Working Committeeto demit office.   Nevertheless the situation during thelast few days has undoubtedly deteriorated, and there is a grave risk that, at the meeting of the Congress working committee fixed for 7th October to consider the matter again in the light of any answer their statement may haveelicited, the extremist view will prevail, and that theCongress in general, and the Ministries in eight provincesin particular, will find themselves committed to a policyof, at best, neutrality, and at the worst of activeopposition to any action taken in pursuance of the war.and that Ministers in eight provinces will probably resignwith no alternative governments In sight.I have been in constant consultation with theGovernor-General throughout this period, and he has now most strongly urged upon me that it is, in his view, essential,unless we are to run the risk of finding ourselves in a situation which might involve us in serious difficulty inIndia, that some practical response should be given to theCongress manifesto.   He proposes, therefore, after seeingIl&apos;r&apos;. Gandhi and other Congress leaders and also the leaderQX the Moslem League and representatives of the princesduring the next.few days, to issue a statement himself in

reply in which he wishes to include, should the Cabinetagree, the passage annexed to this memorandum asAnnexure B, and also to indicate his intention of inviting a Uoay o.f non-official persons, as small aspossible consistently with being sufficientlyrepresentative, to be assoc_iat.su in a consultativecaoacjLt-y.....with the Central Government of India with a viewto receiving information and tendering advice as to theconduct of affairs in India in relation to the war.I have carefully considered, and in some respectsrevised, the Governor-General&apos;s proposed formulain Annexure B, and I am satisfied that, unless somethingon these lines can be said and a practical attempt madeto associate leading Indian politicians with theGovernment of India&apos;s war effort, we may be faced with aserious situation in India, which indeed I admit we may even so fail to avert.I should add that it is not from the Congressalone that an offer of only conditional co-operation is forthcoming.   Within the last few days the Moslem Leaguealso has thought fit to make demands, though of anentirely different character, as the condition of thesupport of that community.    The Moslem demands may beregarded as almost the converse of those of the Congress,namely, that Federation should be definitely dropped (as likely to involve the subjugation of the Moslem minorityto a Hindu Raj) and that the provincial Governors should forthwith exercise the powers they possess, but which itis alleged they have hitherto omitted to use, for theprotection of Moslem interests. It will be apparent thatthe Moslem attitude makes it necessary, in anything whichmay be said to meet the Congress demands, to avoid furtherantagonising the Moslem community.

1 %1. . t) OINDIA OFFICE.25th September 1939.I need only say this in explanation of the passage in Annexure B.    The Governor-General having publicly state.;:after consultation with me, that the outbreak of war hasmade it inevitable - to put into abeyance the practicalsteps towards bringing the States into the Federationwhich had been under his consideration and mine for many months, it seems to me self-evident that when the time comes to resume work in that connection it will beimpossible, in view of the hostility with which theFederal provisions of the Act have been met, though for different reasons, by the princes, the Moslems and the hindus in India, to expect that it will be possible to putinto operation Part II of the Act as it stands; and if, asI am convinced, this will in fact be impossible, I can see no harm in admitting it,1-7U 0

ANNEXURE A.Telegraphic summary of the Working Committee&apos;sManifesto.Working Committee statement is to effect that working committee have considered position;    that the principles which guide &quot;the nation in the event of a war&quot; have beenrepeatedly laid down by Congress, and were reiterated onlya month ago by the Working Committee, who :lexpressed theirdispleasure at the flouting of Indian opinion by theBritish Government in India&quot;.   As a first step todissociating themselves from this policy of the BritishGovernment, the Committee called upon Congress members ofthe Central Assembly to refrain from attending next sessionSince then, British Government have declared India as abelligerent country, promulgated ordinances, passedGovernment of India Act Amending Bill, &amp;c. without consentof Indian people whose declared wishes in such matters havebeen deliberately ignored by British Government.    TheWorking Committee must take gravest view of these developments.Congress unhesitatingly condemn &quot;latest aggression ofNazi Government in Germany,  and sympathise with those whoresist it. 11Congress has further laid down that issue of war and peace for India must be decided by Indian people and nooutside authority can impose a decision upon them;    nor canIndian people permit their resources to be exploited forimperialist ends.   Any imposed decision or attempt to useIndian resources for purposes not approved by them will necessarily have to be opposed by them.    If co-operation is desired in a worthy cause, it must be between equals by mutual consent for a cause which both consider to be worthy.

The sympathy of the people of India is entirely on the sideof democracy and freedom.   But India cannot associateherself in a war said to be for democratic freedom when the!very freedom is denied to her and when such limited freedomas she possesses is taken away from her.    Calcutta statementproceeds that while France and Great Britain have declaredthat they are fighting for democracy and freedom, recent &apos;past shows constant divergence between spoken word and realmotives, and refers to fact that 11 treaties embodying imperialdesigns for carving out of Ottoman Empire&quot; were framed duringlast war despite its objectives.    Reference is also made toTreaty of Versailles,  division of German colonial empire,Manchuria, Abyssinia, Czecho-Slovakia, and Spain.If the war is to defend status quo of imperialpossessions &amp;c. then India can have nothing to do with it.If, however, issue is democracy and a world order based ondemocracy then India is intensely interested in it.    TheCommittee are convinced that interests of Indian democracydo not conflict with interests of British democracy orof world democracy.    The statement proceeds toallege an inherent and ineradicable conflict betweendemocracy for India, -or elsewhere and imperialism and fascism..If Great Britain fights for maintenance and extension of democracy, then she must necessarily end imperialism in her own possessions and establish full democracy in India,and Indian people must have the right of self-determinationby framing their own constitution through a constituentassembly without external interference and must guide theirown policy.   A free democratic India will gladly associateherself with other free nations for mutual defence against aggression and for economic co-oioeration.    &quot;We will work,for establishment of a real world order based on freedom and

democracy&quot;.   Present crisis is likely to re-fashion thev/orld radically. . India, which has been the outstandingexample of modern imperialism is crux of problem and must play an important part with her vast resources in any scheme of world reorganisation.    But she can only do so asa free nation whose energies have been released to work forthis great end.The Goiviriittoe have noted that many Indian Rulers&apos;have offered their services, &amp;c. and expressed their desire tosupport the cause of democracy in Europe.    They will do bestfirst to introduce democracy in their own States, at presentundilutedly autocratic.    British Government in India ismore responsible for this autocracy than even Rulersthemselves.    Committee fail to find any evidence that present war declarations of British Government are being or are going to be acted upon.    True measure of democracy isend of imperialism and fascism alike and aggression that hasaccompanied them In the past and present.    Only on that basiscan a new order be built up.    Committee arc eager anddesirous to help in every way in the struggle for that new order, but &quot; carmot themselves or offer anyco-operation in a war which is conducted on imperial lines and which is meant to consolidate imperialism in India and elsewhere&apos;1.Committee,  in view of gravity of the occasion and pace of events,  desire to take no final decision at this stage-so as to allow for full elucidation of issues at stakethe real objectives aimed at and the position of India Inthe present and in the future.    But decision cannot be longdelayed,  as India is being committed from day to day to apolicy to which she is not a party and of which shedisapproves.    The Working Committee therefore invite the

4.British Government to declare in unequivocal terms what their war aims are in regard to democracy and imperialismand the new order that is envisaged.;   in particular, how these aims are going to apply to India and to he giveneffect to in the present.   Do they include the elimination of imperialism and treatment of India as a free nationwhose policy will he guided in accordance with wishes ofher people?   The real test of any declaration is its application in the prcsent./Violence and threat of violence shadow the world, and unless checked and ended will destroy the preciousinheritance of past ages.   That horror has to he checkedin Europe and China, hub it will not end till its rootcauses of fascism and imperialism are removed.   To that end the Working Committee are prepared to give their co-operation;   but it will he infinite tragedy if even thisterrible war is carried on in spirit of imperialism &amp;c.Indian people have no quarrel v/ith Germans or Japanese, orany other people, but with systems which deny freedom andarc based on violence and aggression.    They appeal to indian people to end all internal conflict and controversy,and in this grave hour of peril to keep in readiness and holdtogether as a united nation determined to achieve thefreedom of India within the.larger freedom of the world.

ANNEXURE B.PROPOSED FOBlvPJLA.I have been asked what are the intentions and aims of His Majesty1s Government in relation to India.    I cannot -do better, if I am asked that question, than to refer tothe statement, made, with the full authority of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, by the late Secretary of State forIndia, in the Mouse of Commons on &apos;6th February, 1935.That statement makes the position clear beyond any shadowof douot.    It referred to the pledge given in the preambleof the Act of 1919,  and it made it clear that it was no part of the plan of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to repealthat pledge.    It confirmed equally the interpretation putby Lord Trwin, as Viceroy, in 1939, again on the authorityof the Government of the day, on that preamble - that &quot;thenatural issue of India1s progress as there contemplated is the attainment of Dominion Status&quot;.    I need not dilate on the words of that statement.    They are clear and positive.    They areenshrined in Parliamentary records, they stand as a definite and categorical exposition of the policy today of His Majesty &apos; sGovernment, and of their intentions in regard to   the future constitutional development and position of India.We have had many references to the Act under which thegovernment of this country is at present carried, on.    I will only say on that, that the Government cf India Act of 1935&quot;was based on the greatest measure of common agreement which itwas possible to obtain at that time.    It was based too, as you know, on the common labours of British and Indianstatesmen and of representatives of British India as wellas of the Indian States,  over a long period of years.Nevertheless when the stress of war is over.and the time comes to resume consideration of plans for the future federal government of India and of plans destined to give effect to

assurances given in Parliament by the late Secretary ofState just referred to, it will be necessary to reconsiderin the light of eventual circumstances to what extent thedetails of the plan embodied in the Act of 1935 remainappropriate.    I am authorised by His !via;jesty&apos;s Government tosay that they have no hesitation in expressing, even atthis stage, their readiness in that connection and at thattime to consider, In consultation as may be necessary withthe various interests affected, whether on particular pointsa sufficient basis of agreement in India exists to justifythem in recommeriding to Parliament any changes ormodifications in the scheme of government embodied in theAct, with the object of furthering the expressed intentions of His Majesty 1s Government.
