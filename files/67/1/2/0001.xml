Sir James Rae... whose services as administrativehead of the mission I Have been fortunate enough to obtain, isstarting for Canada this week with the remaining members of themission02. It was contemplated thats in addition to taking action for the establishment of war potential in Canada, the missionwould take preliminary steps to establish a mission in New York,to be developed in the event of war into a full purchasingorganisation on the lines recommended by Lord Riverdale in his report. Annex B to Paper Noo CoP.177(39)o3ffl Since we are at war., the position in regard to the U.S-.A.needs further consideration-.    In Appendix (N)  of his report,Lord Riverdale set out a s cheme for a purchasing commission inthe UoSoAoj, to be establislied in the present circumstances where we are at war and the United States is no to40 The scheme requires the appointment of a Controller-General to be sent out from England and the first step, Ithink. is to decide who this is to bec

5.      The Secretary of State for Air and myself agree that colonel J. H.  Greenly should he appointed.      Ke is a qualifiedengineer.      As Chairman of the Prime .1 minister&apos;s Advisory panel of Industrialists, he has now obtained a very considerableknowledge of the supply problems of the Departments in thiscountry.     As Chairman of Messrs. Babcock and wilcox, he hasa considerable knowledge of American business, and hispersonality is thought to be well adapted to the needs of a situation which will require very careful handling till thegeneral position of the U.S.A.  in regard to assistance in thewar is clarified.6.      If the V/ar Cabinet approve9 I should propose to get into touch with Colonel Greenly at once, request him to xtndertakethis work which I have no doubt he will be prepared to do, andto arrange to proceed to the United States.      If it is thoughtprudent, he could go over there ostensibly in his privatecapacity to make touch with the American Babcock and V/ilcoxCompany.      At the same time I could arrange with the otherDepartments concerned to allot the remainder of the personnelproposed under L,ord Hiverdale&apos;s scheme.7.      All the above must of course be conditional on arrangements being made to find finance for essential purchases in the U.S.A. -a matter now receiving attention by a special Treasury Committee.8.      Another matter to which attention must be given is liaison with the French as to purchases in the U.S.A.      This presumablycan be handled through the liaison arrangements at the Committeeof Imperial Defence - if not, it will require ad hoc consultation in Paris.9.      I may perhaps add that, as the v/ar develops, we may very well need arrangements for purchases in Canada much larger thanthose so far made, and that these will require close co-ordinationwith any arrangements in the U.S.A.      For the effectiveestablishment

establishment of such co-ordination, when the time comes,Colonel Greenly and Sir James Rae would be extremely suitable.This aspect of the matter can however be dealt with as thesituation develops.Recommendations.1.    That authority be given to take stepsto establish a mission in New York asin paragraphs 2 and 3.2.    That Colonel J.K.  Greenly be ControllerGeneral and that he proceed to theU. S.A.(Initialled) L.B.The Adelphi.5th September, 1939.
