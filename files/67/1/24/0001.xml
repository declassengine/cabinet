q do:Ku&apos;vBnfc is tiro prooerty of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment)Copy No..(G)(33) 24.Memorandum by the Secretary of Stato. for India.In accordance with the decision of the bar cabinet of the 27th September (W.M.(39)29, Conclusion 12) I havebeen in communication with the Viceroy on the matterssubmitted to the Cabinet in my Memorandum of September the25th, :&apos;&quot;v.P.(g)(39)21, and I now attach as annexures to thisMete copies of my telegram of September the 27th to theViceroy and of his reply of September the 28th.   It willbe seen that so far as toe proposed Consultative Committeeis concerned the position is altogether fluid and that theViceroy is in no way committed.   He is fully seized of theviev?s of the Cabinet and I hope that he and I may now begiven discretion to proceed on the general lines indicatedin W.P.(g)(39) 21 read with the telegrams which form theannexures to this Note.2- The Viceroy and I are agreed that it will be essential, however things turn out, that he should issue astatement the nature of which must depend on the decision of congress as to their attitude.   The general lines of theincitement which he would propose to make in the twoI alternative cases are set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 of his statement   to which a reference is made inParagraph 8 of his telegram, would be on the lines that so&quot;%r as our general war aims are concerned they are. *oentially &quot;the safeguarding of sanctity of treaties aridlhe discharge of our obligations to Poland and to our other&quot; les, the necessity of the re-establishment of the

The Viceroy is of opinion that if the outcome ofthe discussions which he is at present carrying on seems likely to be a break with Congress, it may be desirable for him to call an all parties Conference &quot;to discussarrangements in connection with the co-operation of indian the prosecution of the war.&quot;   His view is that congress would probably put themselves in the wrong bydeclining an invitation to attend, but that if they aidattend the hollowness of their claim to speak for thewhole of India would quickly be demonstrated by theattitude of the Muslims and the Princes.   He would like a contingent authority to summon such a Conference if the trend of events made it desirable.   His reason for seeking the approval of the Cabinet is the risk that the various parties might agree among themselves and present us withdemands of an embarrassing nature.    In my view the risk is negligible,4. I now seek authority to proceed on the general lines indicated in this Note and its annexures.Z.OFFICE.29th September 1939.

Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated27th September 1939.660private and personal.    Continuation of my telegram25th September, 643..    War Cabinet were critical of our proposed approach to Congress, chief criticism being directed to consultative committee.   There was a fear thatit might entrench itself too deeply in the machinery ofGovernment and that in due course great pressure would bebrought to bear on us to give it some measure of control.Various questions were asked; in particular would its membership be constant or vary from time to time and woulddifferences in the committee itself be resolved by vote?Would Congress have a majority in the committee?   I saidfirst point was a matter for consideration and I said &quot;No&quot;to the other two, though Congress might be the largestseparate element in the committee.    Cabinet asked me toput their doubts to you and to let them have a moreconcrete picture of the composition and functions of thecommittee before they came to a decision.   General feeling was that if link of this kind between Government and publicwas necessary it should be modelled on Committee ofImperial Defence here in this respect that it consists oipersons summoned by prime Minister to particular meetingsfor particular purposes, those summoned attending byinvitation and not as by right.    It was suggested forexample that there might be a panel with various sectionssuch as a Congress section, a Muslim section, a Princessection, an industrialists&apos; section and so on   from which you would choose the persons to be summoned for eachmeeting.    I think if you could inform me that these werethe lines on which you were proposing to work Cabinet&apos;&apos;&apos;;ould agree,   with regard to formula, while not

enthusiastic,Cabinet did not wish to withhold theirassent; but it was strongly urged that in your discussions and still more in any subsequent statement stress shouldbe laid upon the parlous position in which India would find herself at the end of a war if Great Britain wasvanquished; that it was Great Britain who served as ashield to protect India against the aggressive Powers,find that the leaders of Indian political parties had arare opportunity of earning the gratitude of the british people, and that gratitude was much more likely to oearfruit than resentment caused by hostility in their timeof need.   Please let me have earliest possible reply to cabinet&apos;s doubts about consultative committee and yourgeneral agreement with their suggestions re a statement.

21QiLSprivate and personal.   Many thanks for your private and personal telegram September 27th, 660.    I am most grateful for this full information of the general attitude of theCabinet both towards any machinery for associating publicopinion here-   with conduct of the war and towards our proposed formula; and I have, I need not say, consideredwith greatest care the points raised by them.2.     I feel certain that they appreciate that the suggestion for a consultative committee remains in formative stage andthat I am in no way committed in the least degree either toit or to any other specific method of associating public-opinion with the conduct of the war, though it has of courseb-Qen necessary for you and me to explore in some detailvarious alternative solutions and I have as you know soundedGandhi about them without committing myself.    Indeed, as youwill have gathered from my telegram of yesterday, Gandhi&apos;sown feeling was definitely inclined to be hostile to a consultative committee, evidently because he sensed danger ofa split on communal lines and consequent broadcasting ofhollowness of Congress claim to speak for India as a whole,and to prefer a committee drawn from the legislature.3.     I have of course in considering the constitution and procedure of any committee, but particularly of a consultat-ive committee, had throughout in mind the risk that it mightimpinge on field of responsibility of, or even usurp the function of the Government of India or my Executive Council,or for that matter trench upon the province of legislature,iwy own.-judgment is that this risk would be largely minimisedby the existence within committee of communal differences ancTTVMSDIATE 866-&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; XXXTelegram from Viceroy dated 28th September 1939.

1 ( 6- 2 -by avoidance of decisions taken by vote, but principal-ecurity would be an effective chairmanship, and I have as/nii know, throughout con tempi a ted that I should myselfnreside.over meetings of whatever organisation of this typew9 ujgy establish.    I would hope that I might with theauthority and prestige of Governor-General be able to keepthings on right lines.   I am entirely clear that if Committeeshowed signs of getting out of hand, immediate adjournment,and if need be a decision not again to assemble it (whatever the consequences of that decision might be) would be calledor.   I think that there is great force in suggestionmentioned in your telegram that if committee was consultativefnd not merely drawn from the Legislature we should workfon a basis of invitation, the only permanent member beingfthe Governor-General as Chairman.     I quite agree-as tofermia facie practical attraction, as an alternative to abroad-based consultative committee, of something on theines of the Committee of Imperial Defence with a panel   -ystem such as you mention; but I would like to think thisjover at greater leisure.B(;    I think equally that I persuaded Gandhi that the proposal1.0 expand the Governor-General&apos; s Executive Council so as to institute it as a War Cabinet containing representatives ofImportant parties is for various reasons quite impracticable,rtiink particularly in the light of his view, for what that&apos;&quot;orfh, it may be possible to get through with nothing moreJpuuable than a committee of legislature, meeting at fixedlarvals to hear as much confidential military news as weBill -1aua safely convey to its members.I  1 now turn to your question of our declaration.    I takeT tna&quot;t Cabinet is in your own words not enthusiastic about&quot;-&quot;bough they do not wish to withhold their assent; and you

*oerai lines would be expression of appreciation and gratitude* distance which India has given and is likely to continue&quot;tested in paragraph 3 of my private and personal telegram ofa&quot;september, 2059-S, followed by a statement that in the,no I will almost certainly have to consider the position in,00-ara to it in greater detail later alter I have seen Nehruand itajendra Prasad.   For all that it may well be necestary totake decision at very short notice and it is for that reasongst others than I am anxious to clear the ground as far aspracticable in advance with you and with the Cabinet on thiscatter.My own conclusion is that whether there is a break with congress or not, a declaration will be desirable,   publicoDinion here is now quite clearly, so far as I can judge fromuress, from political leaders ana from information I receive from members of my own Council in touch with general situation,ported up to a pitch of expectation of a declaration of some sort as regards the constitutional position and our aims in war.7.    Declaration would fall to be made in one of two sets ofurcumstances:  (a) in which, consequent on discussion withIpolitical leaders, etc., I was satisfied it represented a[sufficient face-save to give us some hope in the light of itfp-et Congress etc. would be prepared even with some amount ofPublic indication of discontent at its terms to co-operate,*0) in which it had been necessary for us to break with-ongress on ground that we could not properly accede to theirfptrands and must face the resultant breakdownThe object of declaration and its value in first set of circumstances is obvious.    In that event it would be&quot;--ecessary to recapitulate past history or emphasise the^compatibility of claims of Congress and Moslem League.3ifin war, general statement of our war aims on lines I...: SSte

circumstances in which united effort was of utmost importanceit was desirable to remove any misunderstandings which mightundermine or reduce the value of that effort and by a state-nient on the lines of proposed constitutional declaration;nth, in conclusion, an appeal for unity, etc.9,      In the second set of events, declaration would commenceby a statement of opposing claims of Congress and Moslems asset out in their manifestos emphasising their incompatibilityand would proceed very much on the lines suggested inparagraph 8 with appropriate minor modifications, concludingby a statement that it was for everyone to reach his owndecision on issues involved in co-operation with the war, thatwe did not question sincerity of Congress in the decision theyhad reached; but that we regarded it as mis taken and trustedthat in the light of explanations now given they would feel able in due course to reconsider the matter.10.    My feeling, in other words, is that a declaration isessential, (a) because of the very strong pressure for onehere which has been spread well into general public as distinct from politicians: (b) because of the extreme importanceoi setting ourselves right with public opinion abroad as well asln India and in the event of a break giving Congress something0 chew on on the basis of which they can, on more matureElection, if necessary, pat their words.I&quot;.    Let me add in this connection that I will miss no[opportunity of&apos; impressing upon Indian politicians whom I see[position in which India would find herself in the event ofGreat Britain losing the war; and I will readily consider to!*at extent I could work that into   my declaration, although IBID ^xious in this extremely sensitive country to avoid any^gestion either of lecturing my audience or threatening it.

12.     On general position I am sure finally that Cabinetrealise that I am chaffering with politicians in Congress whoas I indicated in paragraph 6 of my telegram of 21st Septembe2003-S, do not know what it is that they themselves want, butrtn are much afraid of their own left wing and desperatelyanxious to extract from us something with which they mayreassert their dwindling hold over younger members of their part who show signs of coming under the influence of Dose.It may be argued&quot;that that is an argument for not takingCongress too seriously ana I have already on more than one occasion recently emphasised that my own fear is that rightT*&apos;ing are apprehensive that they may not, if they reach anagreement with us, be able to deliver the goods.   But be thatas it may, they are largest party and most important inBritish India and are responsible for governments of nineprovinces and we should make a very great mistake (both from our immediate point of view and of possible misunderstanding; by outside world) if we did not do our utmost to turn toadvantage such readiness as right-wing may show to work in witjus.   I regard, nuisance value of Congress, if they turn against us, as very substantial, and I believe, and Commander-in-Chiefagrees with me, that they have it in their power in that eventlargely to cripple our capacity to exert our maximum strength in the war.    It is in these circumstances and in the light ofthese considerations that it is in my judgment worth while taking some risk in seeking to secure support of Congress.But I need not say that you and Cabinet may rest entirelyassured that I will not commit either you or them without yourapproval, or recommend to you the paying of an excessive priceBnd that I shall continue as hitherto to keep in the most^mediate touch with you over all developments.

l2     IV;y view at this stage is that, while I think I canpostpone acute crisis for some weeks only I do not regardprospect of avoiding an ultimate break with Congress as atp11 good.   I am clear too that if -Congress Ministers resign,we must reckon on their active opposition after a longer orshorter interval to all war measures, accompanied by a rapiddeterioration of elementary law and order position throughout India,   ks I indicated inmy private and personal telegramN0.2097-S of September 27th, I feel confident that in such circumstances I can rely on full support of Cabinet and-yourself in dealing with resultant, situation in most resolute[manner possible.114.     I will only add that my discussions with Gandhi have(apparently, according to a message just received from Lumley,resulted in the postponement of placing before legislatures by congress Ministers of resolution regarding co-operation in timeof war, the text of     which was reported in Stewart&apos;s telegramof September 21st, No.1083-G.S., and to that extent that I mayhave secured more time in which to look about and to continuewo consult various interests.   R. Prasad as weir as Nehru.haslow accepted my invitation to Delhi for October 3rd.
