This Documentisl^ &apos; on g T.        -&quot;-&apos;-&quot; COPY NO. D(5) (39) 13&apos;WAR    CABINET.CONSIGNMENT OF TIMBER PROM U.S.S.R. AND machine tools FOR U.S.S.R.STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY.I submit the following statement in pursuance ofWar Cabinet 16(59) Conclusion 15(iv) and (v).      I have as requested examined in some detail the position as to Timberand Machine Tools.(l)   Timber now held up by the Soviet Union.Almost all Russian Timber now held up in the White Seaconsists of Sawn Softwood of good quality which is used for building and constructional work of all kinds.The Controller of Timber Supplies is now taking stock of all available supplies of Timber in this Country,  and, thoughcomplete returns are not yet available,  it is clear that stocks are very low.     Throughout this year prices have been on thehigh side and imports, particularly of Softwood, have beenlower than usual.      In recent months there have &quot;been heavy demands for military hutments, evacuation camps,  and A.R.P. work.On the outbreak of war,  Service demands naturally increasedrapidly and there is no doubt that they will continue to expand-.The position at the moment is extremely grave and it is highly doubtful whether on the most favourable expectations asto imports there will be as much timber as is required for service requirements and other work of vital importances.In 1938 total imports of Sawn Softwood were less thanl? million standards as against 2 million standards in eacfo- ofthe two preceding years.      Of the quantity received in 1938,544,000 standards came from the Soviet Union,  290,000 from canada, 34,000 from the United States, 4,000 from Finland,Sweden, Poland, Latyia and Esthonia.      In future some shipmentsmay perhaps be made from the Western. Coasts of Sweden and norway but it seems clear that not a great deal can be expected from any of these five countries.

Norway* Yugoslavia, Italy, Roumania, Portugal and france do not produce Softwood in any quantity though wemay obtain some hardwoods and mining timber from them.It is not, however, a question of finding alternative sources of supply, but of getting hold of every stickv-WJ,of timber that is available.    The Ministj*r x)f supply has now obtained approval for an expenditure of 26,000,000 during the next six months and theController&apos;s proposed purchases will cover all available supplies in the countries mentioned.      Everyeffort is, of course, being made to obtain timber inthe United Kingdom, but we are still suffering from -the effects of the extensive felling during the last war and home supplies can only go a little way towards meeting the Softwood requirements.It may be noted that with the Baltic closed theonly reliable sources of Softwood in quantity are theSoviet Union and Canada, mainly the Western Coast.Shipments from this Coast involve a wasteful use of available space with usually a ballast voyage outwardsand purchase in dollars.     From the point of view of timber Supplies, Shipping and Exchange, it seems ofthe utmost importance that we should obtain thisRussian Timber.(2) Machine Tools under Construction, shipped or awaitingShipment to Russia as at 10th September. 1959.These tools amount to something under  500,000 in value and fall under three headings viz:1.      Tools which could be used in the machine tool industry immediately, in order toincrease the output of machine tools.In some cases very considerable reliefwould be afforded,  as machines would bebrought into use in key positions whichwould otherwise have to wait about twelvemonths, 210,000

Tools which could he used immediately forthe production of armaments.  120 120,0003.Tools which are special to Russianrequirements and could be releasedwithout difficulty. 70,0004.Miscellaneous.It is not possible to give any reliable estimate ofthe extent to which the Armaments Programme would be accelerated by the diversion of these tools.      They dohowever represent at least one or two months output of16 out of the 75 firms in the machine tool industry;In some instances machines for which we should haveto wait twelve months would come into immediate use inkey locations under heading 1 and it would be impossibleto over-estimate the relief thereby afforded.(Intld.)    L.B.The Adelphi,16th September, 1939.
