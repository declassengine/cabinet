[3 mCUVS^T IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC i AdESTY&apos;3 GOVBRN;.3SlfT.!?R3T. COPY Ng.WAR      CABINET.COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.L(QU59)7;1. Since war was declared, the commercial relations between ourselves and the Soviet Union have rapidly worsened and theyhave now become very bad.      The situation may be briefly summarised as follows.2. On our side, we have either refused export licences for goods consigned to Russia, or have delayed the issue of suchlicences.     Among the goods affected are rubber, pedigreelivestock, and, above all, machinery.      The latter consistalmost entirely of goods ordered by the Russians in 1936 and1937 under the  10 million Credit Agreement and now ready for shipment.      It is estimated that about , 1 million of these goods should be despatched in the next few weeks.       7.6 million of the goods purchased under the Agreement have already gone,and the shipment of the remainder is to be completed by september, 1940.3. The hold-up of these goods in the United Kingdom is duelargely to the fact that they are obviously of great utilityto us in time of v/ar.      In some cases Service Departments havealready expressed the desire to take the goods over;    in othersit would be necessary to obtain their consent before the export licence could be granted,      The Departments interested are theMinistry of Supply, the Admiralty and the Air Ministry.4. The Russians on their side appear to have done everything possible to delay shipment of goods to the United Kingdom.    the commodity of overwhelming importance in this connection istimber.      United Kingdom importers have contracted to buy fromthe Russians in the remainder of this shipping season

134,000 standards of timber, 26,000 of which are lying inLeningrad and the remainder in the White Sea and Kara Sea ports.In many cases the Russians have cancelled the contracts for shipping the timber,      In general they have adopted a truculentattitude to the United Kingdom.      The Soviet commissar ofForeign Trade has been puolicly authorised to retaliate againstcountries which discriminate against the Soviet Union by currencyrestrictions, exchange controls, etc.     A Tass communique hasbeen issued to the effect that the United Kingdom have brokentheir Trade Agreement (presumably the  10 million CreditAgreement) by refusing licences for the export of goods to&apos;theSoviet Union.5. In this situation my Department have consulted the Treasury,Foreign Office, Ministry of Economic Warfare, Ministry ofAgriculture, Ministry of Supply and the Service Departments.The Foreign Office view is that there is considerable uncertainty as to the attitude Russia will adopt to the war, and clearly any steps to make a commercial agreement with the Russians will requiresafeguards to prevent them turning it to our disadvantage if theyshould ultimately decide to adopt a hostile or unfriendlyattitude.      But the Foreign Office do not regard the present uncertainty as justifying a refusal to embark on negotiations.6. The dominant issue in the matter seems to be the supply of timber.      Importers had contracted to receive the followingquantities in the next few monthsStandards.Canada ............... 297,000U.S.A.   ............... 23,000Soviet Union .. . . ,____ 175 ,000Finland.............. 163 ,000Estonia ........c..... 5,000Latvia  ........____... . 16,000Sweden............... 122,000Norway............... 3 ,000Poland ............... 56,000Some of this timber has already readied this country, but thebalk has still to come.      The war lias deprived us of supplies^ Ito

from Finlands Estonia, Latvia, Poland and Sweden, (which shipsher timber from her Baltic ports).     The only major supplierleft in Europe is the Soviet Union,     Even if we obtain these supplies which the Russians have contracted to send, theposition will be very bad;    without them it is desperate,increased supplies can be obtained from Canada and the UnitedStates of America, but they will take some time to arrange andwill involve payment in dollars and will be serious from theshipping point of view, particularly as most of the Canadiantimber comes from the Pacific coast.7. There is also the consideration that we have advanced tothe Russians over  7^ million under the 510 million CreditAgreement and that including interest Russia&apos;s obligations under that Agreement exceed  9 million.      That Agreement has so far been fully observed by both parties.    If we now refuse to allow the shipment of goods ordered under the Agreement, the Russianscould make out a case that His Majesty1 s Government have infringedits provisions and that accordingly they themselves are released from their obligations under the Agreement.      They might go so faras to refuse to honour the Promissory Notes which they have issuedand which the Export Credits Guarantee Department have endorsed.8. I recognise that the goods to be shipped to Russia are ofgreat value to us in the conduct of the war, and the ministers responsible for the Departments concerned will no doubt wish tostate their case.      But the timber shortage is desperate and it ispossible that a successful conclusion of even a short-termcommercial arrangement with the Russians may be of considerablevalue, both commercially and politically.      If the Russians should show themselves impossible in the negotiations, we shall have obtained an indication of their general policy towards the Allies.9. The matter is urgent, as the Arctic ports where the timberis lying free so over in the next 6 or 3 weeks.&quot;     I would

accordingly propose that the Foreign Secretary and myself beauthorised to send for h. Haisky and lay before him the following proposals i10* We would say that the outbreak of the war has unfortunatelyled to difficulties on both sides which, no doubt, both governments are anxious to remove.      It will take some time to work out thelines of a comprehensive arrangement and we would propose,therefore, an interim measure to provide for trade up to the endof this year.     The basis of this short-term arrangement wouldbe that each side should authorise the shipment to the other ofgoods approximately equal in value.      The timber lying in theArctic ports is worth at least  l-g- million, and the goods tobe shipped to Russia in the course of the next 3 months wouldprobably not amount to much more than that.     Each Governmentwould hand to the other a schedule of goods which had been purchased before the outbreak of war and would be normally shippedin the next few months.     A joint committee would be set up bythe two Governments to supervise the scheme.     We would make itclear that we are not prepared to enter into prolonged negotiationsas the shipment of timber will not brook delay and we will,therefore, expect a very early reply.      The technical difficultiesin working out such an arrangement in time of war will no doubt be great, but with goodwill on both sides they should not proveinsuperable aO.F.G.3.Board of Trade.13th September, 1939.
