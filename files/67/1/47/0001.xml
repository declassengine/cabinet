yfflS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRETff.P.(G)(39)U7ANGLO-ITALIAN WAR TRADE NEGOTIATIONSMemoranda by the Ministry of Economic WarfareAs my colleagues will be aware from the Fourth weekly report of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, representativesof the Ministry of Economic Warfare and of the Treasury wererecently despatched to Rome to assist His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in discussions with the Italian authorities on the subject of italian trade with this country and with Germany under war conditions.    They have now returned for instructions.2.    In the course of these discussions, which took placein a completely friendly atmosphere,  the Italian authoritiessuggested that, on the analogy of the Franco-Italian Committeeinstituted some years ago,  a permanent Anglo-Italian CommercialCommittee should be established to deal with the following matters:(1 )   Anglo-Italian trade relations,  as provided for under existing commercial agreements,  together with thearrangement of additional purchases in Italy for our war requirements.(2)    The machinery for the payment of these purchases.(3)    Contraband control and all questions arisingout of it.3.    The desire of the Italian Government to deal withthese matters through a joint Committee rather than throughthe/

the normal diplomatic channels may he attributed to theanomalous position of Italy as being both a nominal allyof Germany, and,  at the moment,  a not unfriendly neutralin her relations with this country and Prance.      The proposaloffers certain advantages also from our point of view, andwith the concurrence of the Departments concerned^     I there-fore informed His Majesty1s Ambassador that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared to consider the draft of anagreement for the establishment of such a Committee if theItalian Government were prepared to submit one.h.    A translation of a draft agreement on these lines,which has now been received from the Italian Government,  isattached as Annex A.      It will be seen that it takes the shape of a formal agreement between Heads of States.      Whether or notthis represents an attempt to secure the recognition of the king of Italy as King of Albania, the form proposed,  involving as itdoes both ratification and publicity, is of some interest assuggesting that the Italian Government desire to place their economic relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government upon a formalbasis notwithstanding their special relations with Germany.5.    The draft agreement does not itself specify inany detail the precise functions of the proposed committee.Nominally, in fact,  the functions of the Committee would be confined to mutual trade relations in general, and theiradaptation to war conditions.     This definition would suffice to cover any special questions,  including that of payment,arising out of additional purchases in Italy of goods andcommodities required here for war purposes.     Arrangements forsuch purchases are of political importance as enabling theItalian Government to realise some of the benefits of neutralityand the discussions at Rome showed that the Italian Governmentwere willing to facilitate the -supply to the United Kingdom ofour/,

our requirements - in particular raw materials of Italianorigin and armaments.      As regards the method cf payment,considerable progress was made during the discussions in rome,and it was agreed in principle that our purchases in italy should be paid for through the Anglo-Italian clearing,subject to a modification of the existing clearing arrangements to enable Italy to buy raw materials not only in the UnitedKingdom but also in the British Empirex   with the sterlingproceeds of British purchases in Italy.6.    The draft agreement does nots however, refer inany way to the most delicate of the three matters with whichthe joint Anglo-Italian Committee would be called upon to deal -namely, contraband control.      The Italian Government were willingto give an assurance (similar to that already given to theFrench Government as regards imports from France)    that their imports from the United Kingdom and the British Empire wouldnot be re-exported to Germany:    but, apart from this,  they were unwilling to undertake any definite commitments in regard to thelimitation of their trade with Germany, and I consider that theformation of a joint standing committee offers -the best, if notthe only, chance of securing some sort of collaboration with italy in this respect - more particularly since the discussions in Rome suggested that the Italian authorities might be preparedto consider the institution of what might in time amount to a rationing system for Italian imports, the granting of guaranteesthat imports were destined for domestic consumption, or processing,the notification of cargoes to the United Kingdom authoritiesbefore their arrival at contraband control bases, the provisionof Italian trade statistics (which are now no longer published)and the establishment of some differentiation between Italianimports for domestic consumption or processing and transit tradethrough Italy.x The question of excluding Canada from this arrange-ment was left undecided

-u-7.    I think it is clear that the establishment of theproposed committee would not in itself be  sufficient to solve the problems arising between this country and Italy inconnection with war trade;    and it may be objected that,especially as regards contraband,  it would leave us verymuch in Italian hands,      But it must be remembered that italy is very short of raw materials,that there is a con-siderable balance due by Germany in the Italo-German clearingwhich at any rate for the present tends to discourage furthersales to Germany,  and that the Italian authorities are unlikely to give false guarantees in respect of goods which theyurgently require themselves.      The question of transit tradeis both more important and more difficult, and I should haveliked to stipulate definite conditions in regard to it,      on balance, however,  I am inclined to think that the only hopeof obtaining a satisfactory arrangement cn this question isto leave it open for discussion in the joint committee whenagreement has been reached on the simpler question of supplies for Italian consumption.      Meanwhile,  the proposed agreement would in no way tie our hands as to the exercise of our contraband control in regard to suspected cargoesr.8.    The draft submitted by the Italian  Government,  apartfrom being open to objection on the ground that it is in Headsof State form, goes rather farther than I am prepared torecommend in regard to the powers to be conferred upon theStanding Committee,,      To meet those objections,   a revised draft,  attached as Annex B, has been prepared.      It is ingovernmental form;    and the main effect of the textual amend-ments would be to make the Committee a channel of consultationfor the submission of recommendations rather than an executiveorgan.

9.    I accordingly recommend:(1) That approval should he given in principle to thecontinuance of negotiations on the lines indicated above;  and(2) That His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome should beauthorised to express the readiness of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom to conclude an agreement on the linesof the draft reproduced as Annex B.(Initialled)    R.H.C.20th October 1939-
