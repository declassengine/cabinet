Copy Nowar__cjL.LXJLil.jrMemorandum by the Secretary of State;for -India,The Cabinet will remember that as a result ofdiscussion at their meeting on October the 2nd (seeVv.M.(39) 34) I was authorised to proceed upon the general lines set out in Vv.P. (G) (39)21 and W.P.(G)(39)24 with aview to securing if possible the co-operation of theIndian National Congress and other political parties inthe conduct of the war.    I stated that in the view of theViceroy, with which I was in full agreement, it was essential that sooner or later he should issue a statement as to the intentions and aims of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin regard to India and I undertook to communicate thedraft terms of such a statement to the Cabinet for their consideration.    Since then the Viceroy has been inconstant consultation with the leaders of all the main political parties and communities and he is of opinionthat the time for the issue of a statement has now come.Its terms have been the subject of constant consultation between him and rne and I now submit the text for theconsideration and, I hope, the approval of the Cabinet.I think that so far as commitments are concerned it mayconfidently be said to be within the limits laid down by&quot;the Cabinet in the course of previous discussions.    It isimpossible to say if it will serve to prevent a breakfith Congress: but it will I believe be welcomed by other:.?.(G)(39y

- 2 -parties and communities and will strengthen our hands inthe eyes of public opinion generally in the event of congress refusing to co-operate on the terms offered.2. Time is of considerable importance, for althoughthe All-India Congress Committee at their meeting onOctober the 7th took no overt step beyond endorsing thestatement issued by the Working Committee on September the14th, it is unlikely that they will be willing to hold their hand much longer and the Viceroy would like to issue the statement not later than Tuesday, October the 17th,with a view to its appearing in the newspapers here and inIndia on the morning of Wednesday of next week.    In this event I would propose to present it to Parliament in theform of a White Paper on the afternoon of Tuesday, the17th.Z.[INDIA OFFICE.12th October 1939.

973VTelegram from Viceroy dated 11th October 1939.Following is the text of the draft declaration.&quot;Since the outbreak of the war and moreparticularly during the last four weeks, I have been inthe closest touch with the leaders of political opinion in British India and with the representatives of thePrincely Order; and I have spared no effort to acquaintmyself by personal discussion with the trend of feeling;to ascertain the views of the different sections ofpublic opinion in this country on the great questions ofthe day, and in particular on this question of the basis on which, and the extent to which, India could bestco-operate in the prosecution of the war; and to satisfymyself as to the extent to which a basis of common agree-ment exists, and as to the manner in which the position,so far as it may still remain obscure, can best be clarified.   Matters have now reached a point at which, inmy judgment,  it would be well that I should make astatement designed, in the light of the discussions whichI have had during these past few weeks, to clear theposition on the main questions which emerge at thepresent moment;    I would make a preliminary observation.I have had the advantage of a.full and frank discussionwith no fewer than /b&quot;lank7 people - with Mr. Gandhi, withthe President and members of the Congress working committee, with Mr. Jinnah and with representative-members of the Moslem League organisation, with theChancellor of the Chamber of Princes and with a great variety of persons prominent in the political life ofBritish India,   as was only to be expected, conversations

- 2 -with representatives of so many different points of viewrevealed marked differences of outlook, markedly differentdemands and markedly different solutions for the problems that lie before us.   Again, and that too was what mighthave been expected at a time such as the present,reservations or demands for special protection on one side have tended to be balanced by proposals for stillsore marked constitutional changes on another.    I would ask that these differences of view, deeply and sincerelyheld I have not the least doubt by those who have advanced them to me, should be borne in mind when weconsider our present problems, for they have a verydirect and obvious relevance to them.I trust most earnestly that I shall be able todispel certain misapprehensions which are, I am clear,widely and genuinely held, and that, even if to a degreemore limited than has been urged upon me from many quarters, I may be able to clarify the position asregards our hopes and our objectives for India, and homake some little contribution to the removal of obstacleswhich the existing doubts on that point have caused tothat fuli, generous, and ready co-operation which it is,I am certain, her anxiety and that of her peoples to givetoday to a good cause.The essential matters on which a clarification ofthe position is beyond any question desired are,;(a) what are the objectives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the war?   To what extent are they of such a character that a great nation with a long and independenttradition of its own can, with a clear conscience,associate itself with them?

(b) What is the future that is contemplated in theconstitutional sphere for the Indian continent?   what are the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government?   Is it possible to define those intentions more precisely and insuch a manner as&apos;to leave the world in no doubt as tothe ultimate status envisaged for India as far as theBritish Commonwealth is concerned?(c) In what way can the desire of India and ofIndian public opinion for a closer association, and an effective association, with the prosecution of the warbest be satisfied?Let me deal with these questions in the order in which Ihave stated them.   Let me in the first place consider towhat extent in existing conditions and at this stage inthe development of the campaign in which we are engagedany positive and satisfactory answer admits of being given to the demand for a more precise definition of our objectives.    In endeavouring to answer that question I donot propose to touch on the question of our objectives for India.    That is a matter which I will deal with separately in answering the second question which I have mentioned above.    I will frankly admit that my difficulty- inspecifically defining the objectives before His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at this stage in the campaign is very great.His Majesty&apos;s Government have not themselves yet definedl&apos;ith any ultimate precision their detailed objectives in-be prosecution of the war.    It is obvious that such a definition can come only at a later stage in the campaign,snd that when it does come,  it cannot be a statement ofthe aims of any single Ally.    There may be many changes inthe world position and in the situation that confronts us

before the war comes to an end, and much must depend onthe circumstances in which it does come to an end, andon the intervening course of the campaign.The experience of all history shows in thesecircumstances the unwisdom and impracticability ofprecise definition at so early a stage as that which wehave now reached.    But the fact that, for the reasons Ihave given, a precise definition is not practicable doesnot mean, as I see it, that there is any real doubt, orany uncertainty, in the minds of the public, whether inIndia or in the United Kingdom, or in any Allied country,as to the motives which have actuated us in entering into war, and consequently the broad general objectives whic hre have before us in the campaign which is now being waged.They have been stated on more than one occasion; but i will state them again.   We are fighting to safeguard thesanctity of treaties and to discharge our obligations to poland and to our other Allies, to re-establish theprinciple of negotiation as against the principle of force;to assert the importance due to the full discharge ofhonourable obligations entered into between nations; touphold the fundamental principle of fair and honestdealing between nation and nation and man and man; tore-affirm the claims, in the international as in theprivate sphere, of equity and justice as against dishonestyand opportunism.    In fighting for them we are lighting noti0f ourselves alone; nor, as I have seen suggested, for-uupe rial ism&quot; , however defined.   We are fighting forlc!?als the achievement and preservation of which is an-ssential condition of the maintenance of our civilisation,&quot;ncJ oi the safeguarding and development of human existence

in this world to-day.   Our objective is that after thewar these things way be secure in the world.   General asmay be that statement of the position, and general interms as may be our objectives as indicated in it, it is,I think, such as clearly to establish the nature of thecause for which we are fighting and to justify, ifjustification is needed, the extension by India of hermoral support and her goodwill to the prosecution ofthat cause.Let me turn now to the second question whichhas been put to me - the question of India and of thelines of her constitutional development.   That is aquestion, I am certain,in the light of my conversations,which is of the greatest and most acute interest to all parties and all sections of opinion in this country.As matters stand to-day, the constitutional position ofIndia and the policy of His iwajesty&apos;s Government is governed by the provisions of the Government of india act, 1935.     Part III of that Act] which provides forthe conferment of provincial autonomy on the provinces of British India, has been implemented.   For nearly two-and-a-half years now the Provinces have been conductingtheir own affairs under the scheme of the Act.    Thatthey have done so, on the whole, with great success, evenif now and then difficulties have arisen, no one canquestion.    Whatever the political party in power in thoseProvinces - whether the Congress Party in tire majority ofthem, or coalition Governments in the Punjab and Bengal -all can look with satisfaction on a long and distinguishedrecord of public achievement during the last two-and-a-half years.    The experience that they have had has shownbeyond any question that whatever minor problems the

- 6 -2application of the scheme of the Act may have presented;whatever difficulties may have confronted us in theoperation of the Act from time to time in the provincialsphere; the scheme of the Act is essentially sound, andthat it transfers great power and gives greatopportunities to popularly elected governments dependenton the support of a majority in their Legislatures.&apos;rhe second stage contemplated by the Act was therecoinstitution of the Central Government on such a basis as to achieve the essential goal of Indian unity.   Themethod contemplated for that purpose was the achievement of a federation of all India, in which the representativesof all political parties in British India would,together with the Rulers of the Indian States, formaunified Government of India as a whole.    I am only tooconscious of the severity of the criticisms that havebeen advanced from many different points of view againstthe federal scheme and against the arrangements embodied in Part II of the Act.    I will say to-day no more thanthat, having myself had so close a familiarity not only with the framing of the provisions, but with the prelim-inary work which has been done with a view to puttingthem into force, I have throughout believed that thefederal scheme in its operation would have turned out as satisfactory as, broadly speaking, we can all of usr?gard. the scheme of provincial autonomy as having turned out.   t nop dilate on that subject to-day, for our^rk in connection with the federal scheme has been suspended.    But in reaffirming as I do my belief in theessential soundness of the federal aspects of the Act of^35, I do so with greater emphasis because of the

evidence which the federal provisions of the Actconstitute of the anxiety of His Majesty&apos;s Government to achieve, with the minimum delay, and on the basis which appears to represent the greatest amount of agreementbetween various parties and interests affected, the unity of India, and advance beyond a further and a mostimportant milestone on the road to India&apos;s goal.Such being the background against which we are working, what are the intentions and aims of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in relation to India?   I cannot do better in reply to that question than to refer to thestatement made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government,andwith their full authority, by the late Secretary ofState for India in the House of Commons on February 19th,1935.     That statement makes the position clear beyond ashadow of doubt.    It refers to the pledge given in the preamble of the Act of 1919, and it makes it clear thatIt was no part of the plan of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto repeal that pledge.    It confirms equally the inter-oretation placed in 1929 by Lord Irwin, as Viceroy,again on the authority of the Government of the day, onthat Preamble, that &quot;the natural issue of India1sprogress as there contemplated is the attainment ofDominion Status&quot;.    I need not dilate on the words ofthat statement.    They are clear and positive.    They areenshrined in Parliamentary record.   They stand as adefinite and categorical exposition of the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to-day and of their intentionsto-day in this end, the future constitutional develop-fnent and the position of India.    I would add that theonly Instrument of Instructions issued to me as Governor-General by His Majesty the Xing-Emperor in May 1937 lays

upon me as Governor-General a direction so to exercise the trust which His Majesty has reposed in me &quot;that the partnership between India and the United Kingdom within our Empire may be furthered to the end that India mayattain its due place among our Dominions.&quot;That is the policy and that is the position.Those are the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Let me go on to say another word about the Act of 1935.That Act was based on the greatest measure of commonagreement which it was possible to obtain at the timewhen it was framed.    It was based, as is well known toall of us, on the common labours of British and Indianstatesmen, and of representatives of British India asveil as of the Indian States over a long period of years.All parties were, at one stage or other, closely associated with those deliberations.    And I can speakfrom personal experience when I bear tribute to theextreme anxiety of all those of us on whom, in the joint select Committee, there fell the more particularresponsibility for devising proposals for the consider-ation of Parliament, to ensure that the fullest accounthad been taken of all interests, of the views of all political parties; and that nothing had been left undoneto ensure that the outcome of our labours reflected thecreatest measure of agreement practicable in theconditions that confronted us.Be that as it may, His majesty&apos;s GovernmentCognise that when the time comes to resume considerationJi the plan for the future federal Government of India,cn&apos;3. of the plan destined to give effect to the assurancesSiven in Parliament by the late Secretary of State, tol- ich I have just referred, it will be necessary to

reconsider in the light of the then circumstances towhat extent the details of the plan embodied in the act of 1935 remain appropriate.   And I am authorised now byHis Majesty&apos;s Government to say that they have no hesitation, even at this stage, in expressing their readiness in that connection and at that time toconsider, in consultation as may be necessary with thevarious interests affected, whether a sufficient basisof agreement exists in India to justify them in recommending to Parliament, with the object of furtheringthe expressed intention of His iviajesty&apos;s Government, any changes or modifications in the scheme of governmentembodied in the Act of 1935.I have, I trust, in what I have just said, made clear that the intention and anxiety of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is, as stated in the Instrument of Instructionsto the Governor-General, to further the partnership between. India and the United Kingdom within the Empire tothe end that India may attain her full place amongst thegreat Dominions.   The scheme of the Act of 1935 is designed as an essential stage in that process.   But Ihave made clear in what I have just said that HisMajesty&apos;s Government will, at the end of the war, beprepared to consider whether, and if so in what respects,and at what point, there exists in India a basis ofagreement such as to justify them in recommending toParliament modifications or variations of the schemewhich the Act embodies.       Let me in that connection addt-hat in conversations I have had, representatives of minorities have urged most strongly on me that full&quot;eight should be given to their views and to their interests in any modifications that may be contemplated.

On that I need say no more than that, over more than adecade, at three Round Table Conferences, and at joint select Committees, His Majesty&apos;s Government consultedvith and had the assistance and advice of representativesof all parties and all interests in this country.    It isunthinkable that we should now proceed to plan afresh,or to modify in any respect, any important part ofIndia&apos;s future Constitution without again takingcounsel with those who have in the recent past been so closely associated in a like task with His iwajesty&apos; sGovernment and with Parliament.That some even more extensive scheme than I have mentioned; some even more widely phrased indication ofthe     intentions    of    His    -Majesty.&apos;.sGovernment is desired in certain quarters in thiscountry, I am fully aware from conversations I have hadduring these last few weeks.   That that is a desire held with sincerity, and that those who hold it are convincedthat it is in the manner in question that the futureprogress and development of India and the expressedintentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government can best be fulfilled, I fully and readily accept.    I would utterone word only of caution.    It is essential in matters ofthis nature, affecting the future of tens of millionsTf people; affecting the relations of two greatcommunities; affecting the Princes of India; affectingthe immense commercial and industrial enterprises, whetherIndian or European, in this country; that the largestmeasure of agreement practicable should be achieved,unless the last state of things is to be worse than thefirst.   With the best will in the world, progress mustbe achieved by practical considerations.    I am convinced

- n -myself, if I may say so with the utmost emphasis, thatLavins regard to the extent of agreement which in factexists in the constitutional field and on this most difficult and important question of the nature of thearrangements to he made for expediting and facilitating the attainment by India of her full stature, there is nothing to be gained by phrases which, widely anagenerally expressed, contemplate a state of things whichis unlikely at the present point of political developsmerit to stand the test of practical application, or to result in that unified effort by all parties and all communities in India on the basis of which alone Indiacan hops to go forward as one and to occupy the place towhich her history and her destinies entitle her.I turn now to the arrangements to be made tosecure the association of public opinion in India withthe conduct of the war.    India&apos;s contribution hasalready been great, to a degree which has impressed theimagination of the world.   At the head of the list Iwould put the contribution which India has made in splriand not in material, terms - the support of her peoplesfor a cause which they can regard as a good, and arighteous cause.    In the material field equally hercontribution is already most significant, and may be greater still.   And in the circumstances the desire, the anxiety, of public opinion in India to be associatedwith the conduct of the war is naturally one with whichI personally have throughout felt the greatest sympathy.In the circumstances I have described, the desirablesteps to ensure that leaders of public opinion should bein closest touch with developments is of the first importance.

-     ilo     -I have discussed with the utmost frankness with theleaders of thevvairious parties who have been good enough tocome to see me in connection with the constitutional position, by what machinery we could best give effect tothis desire.   We have examined, a variety of expedients,and there has been no hesitation on the part of any of usin assessing the advantages and disadvantages presented by each of them.    I do not propose to-day to examine thosevarious alternatives in particular detail.    I will onlysay that in the light of my conversations and of theviews (by no means always in accord) of the representativesof the great parties and of the princes, I am of theopinion that the right solution would be the establishment-of a consultative group, representative of all thepolitical parties in British India, together with theIndian Princes, over which the Governor-General would himself preside, which would be summoned at hisinvitation, which would have as its object the associationof public interest in India with the conduct of the warand with questions relating to war activities; and whichwould be fashioned, as regards its internal constitution;somewhat after the model of the Committee of ImperialDefence in Great Britain.This group,for practical reasons, would inevitably be limited in size.   But His Majesty&apos;^ Governmentcontemplate that it should be entirely representative, andin particular that its personnel should be drawn up bythe Governor-General from panels prepared by the variouspolitical parties, from which a selection of individualsto attend meetings of the group would be made by theGovernor-General by rotation or otherwise as might bethought fit.    I hope in the very near future to enter in/to

- 13 -consultation with political leaders on this question.    Ihave no doubt whatever that an arrangement of this naturewill most materially contribute to associating responsiblepublic opinion, whether in the Indian States or inBritish India, with the steps which are being taken forthe prosecution of the war and with the arrangements that are being made in that connection:   and I am confident too that in an association of this nature ofrepresentatives of all parties and all interests therelies the germ of that fuller and broader association ofall points of view in this country which contains in itthe seeds of such advantage for the future of India as awhole.When I spoke to the Central Legislature a month ago&apos;I made an appeal for unity.    I would repeat the appeal to-day.    It is my earnest hope that the explanationsI have given will have contributed materially to theremoval of the misunderstandings.    It is my hope equallythat His Majesty&apos;s Government may look for the co-operation and assistance of the great parties in British India aswell as the Indian States in the prosecution of the war.The ideals we have set before us, the objects to securewhich we are engaged in the present struggle, are such asto command widespread sympathy and widespread support inIndia.    They are in harmony with her past history and herhighest traditions.    It is my hope and my prayer that inthe grave juncture which we face India will go forward asa united country in support of a common cause. &quot;
