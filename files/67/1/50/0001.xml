THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1939.SECRET. /--/W.P. (G.) (39) 50.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.TRADE WITH RUSSIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, by agreement with the President of theBoard of Trade, a note prepared in his department upon the possibilities of doing a trade deal with Russia.2.   I am very much impressed by two things : (i) the desirability of doing anything we can to drive a wedge between germany and Russia, and(ii) the extreme difficulty of making any direct contact with Russia on thepolitical side.These considerations have led me to feel that it might be possible to make some progress through action in the economic sphere.3. Since the conclusion of the recent Anglo-Soviet barter deal of timberagainst rubber and tin, the Soviet Ambassador has been declaring, both directly to Mr. Butler and others, and indirectly through intermediaries such as sir Stafford Cripps, that his Government would be willing to contemplate a much larger trade deal, and that it would be politically desirable for this to be negotiated at Moscow by a trade delegation headed by some prominent british representative.4. It is not clear, of course, how far M. Maisky is in the confidence ofhis Government; and in the present political situation, when there is apparentlyclose collaboration between the Soviet and German Governments, particularly in economic matters, it is obvious that any trade negotiations with the Soviet Govern-ment would need to be conducted with great caution, both to avoid the risk of commodities of value to Germany being sent on from Russia to that country,and to ensure that any visit to Moscow arising out of the negotiations would notmerely result in the public humiliation of the visitors.5. I have accordingly discussed these possibilities with the President ofthe Board of Trade; and in the attached note it will be seen that it wouldappear possible, given reasonable goodwill on the Soviet side, to negotiate abarter transaction on a sufficient scale, and, if circumstances then seemed topermit, to justify a delegation, which I think would have to be led by thePresident of the Board of Trade, proceeding to Moscow to put the final touchesto the business and to sign the resulting agreement.10650   [20186] copy N6.
26. I think, and the President of the Board of Trade agrees, that it wouldbe desirable to conduct the negotiations in London, and bring them up to sucha point that, so far as we can be. sure of anything with the Soviet Government,agreement was assured. This procedure, coupled with the fact that there are believed to be present in the picture elements that would be attractive to theSoviet Government, might, we may -hope, provide reasonable security against the delegation, if and when it went to Moscow, being cavalierly treated.7. As will be seen from the second page of the note, it is recommended thatthe preliminary approach to the negotiations on our side should be cautious andgradual; and this would clearly be desirable if no political considerations were involved. In view of those considerations, however, and of the urgency of thewhole matter, there is a good deal to be said for telling M. Maisky now that, onthe understanding that a sufficiently comprehensive agreement can be negotiatedin London, and on the further understanding that, once substantial agreement has been reached here, the Soviet Government will not go back on it in Moscow,Mr. Stanley would be willing to head a delegation to Moscow, for the sole purposeof completing and signing the formal document in which the agreement wouldbe embodied. I realise, of course, that no promise which M. Maisky could givewould be an absolute guarantee against his Government breaking their word, and either presenting the President, when he arrived in Moscow, with fresh demands,or refusing to sign anything; but that is a risk which I think we must take inthe present circumstances. It is in any case lessened by the fact that the agree-ment will take several weeks at least to negotiate, during which time Soviet policymay become clarified one way or the other, and at the end of which we canourselves refuse to sign anything, if by then it has become definitely hostile.8. There is, however, a further risk in this procedure, which is of more immediate importance and against which also there is no absolute safeguard.M. Maisky is not discreet, and in this case he would have every motive of self-interest for permitting the news of our intentions to leak out; and that would place us in an awkward position at a time when the Soviet Governments attitudetowards us is ostentatiously unfriendly, and when their proceedings against theBaltic States, and now against Finland, have raised a cry in Scandinavian and other neutral countries, and also in the United States of America, that we should justify our claim to be fighting against aggression in general by taking a stand againstSoviet as well as German aggression. The recent timber deal has already been criticised on that ground in this country and outside; and though the successful conclusion of our Turkish negotiations, in spite of Soviet opposition, will relieveus to some extent from the charge of &quot; going to Canossa,&quot; we shall no doubt incurreproaches. I suggest, therefore, that M. Maisky should be told at the outset thatthe information about a possible visit to Moscow is for himself and for hisGovernment only, and that if he or they allow it to become known, either in thiscountry or abroad, before the negotiations are completed, it will probably become impossible for the visit to take place. I am afraid that this safeguard against that particular risk is not certainly effective, though, if it is true, as I am informed, that the Russians want a trade delegation, it may be better than it looks. It might also be for consideration whether we should not make it aprerequisite of any discussions that Soviet policy towards Finland and scandinavia shall not be such as to make it impossible for us to appear tocountenance it by entering into friendly negotiations with the Soviet Government.But on the whole I am disposed to feel that the political advantages of theproposed action, if it could be successfully carried through, would justify theseveral risks involved; and on the procedure suggested, we ought to be able toform a reasonable judgment of the Russian attitude as discussions proceed. If,in fact, we could pull off a pretty good trade agreement under conditions thatcarried a certain political implication, it would be of great value.H.Foreign Office, October 21, 1939.
SECRET.TRADE WITH RUSSIA.OUR trading relations with the Soviet Union are governed by the commercial agreement of 1934 under which the value of United Kingdom exports andre-exports to the U.S.S.R. must be in a ratio of 1:11 to the value of UnitedKingdom imports from the U.S.S.R. It does not seem that any useful purpose&quot;would be served by negotiating a new Commercial Agreement of this type withthe Soviet Government.A further Agreement affecting our trade relations with Russia before thewar was the  10 million Credit Agreement of 1936; at the outbreak of wargoods had been delivered to Russia to the extent of three-quarters of the totalof  10 million made available to the U.S.S.R. under this Agreement.Upon the outbreak of war we found it necessary to hold up consignments of rubber and other goods to Russia in order to conserve our supplies, and alsoto suspend delivery of the outstanding orders for machinery under the CreditAgreement which were badly needed by the Service Departments. We receivedrepresentations from the Soviet Government in regard to the rubber, &amp;c, andit is clear from a communique- of the official Soviet newsagency that they arealso resentful about the machinery. A memorandum has already been preparedsuggesting a possible line of action in regard to the machinery. It is suggestedthat we should say that while, to our regret, we are unable to release cert?inmachinery, we are taking steps to let the Russians have whatever machinerycan be spared (which will be fairly-substantial) and that we are prepared tooffer a further Credit equivalent in amount to the value of the machineryrequisitioned. It is clearly desirable that the readjustment of the arrangements under the Credit Agreement should be kept separate from any further negotia-tions on the lines of the recent Rubber-Tin-Timber Aoreement; the sjoodsconcerned, being sold on credit, cannot form part of a barter transaction. It is,however, doubtful if the Russians would agree to this procedure, since theywould be glad of any excuse to bring pressure on us to supply the goods withheld.The recent barter agreement was negotiated to put an end to the impassecaused by the Russians having suspended timber shipments while we hadsubstantially suspended the issue of export licences for Russia. The Russianfear that they will not be able to use freely any sterling they acquire from theirsales to the United Kingdom, and before making such sales they wish to know what goods they will be getting in return. Thus there are good reasons for conducting future trade with Russia largely on a barter basis. Such arrange-ments are easy for the Russian Government, since they have a monopoly offoreign trade, while from our point of view they have the value of ensuring thatthe proceeds of Russian exports are spent within the Empire and, if we so wish,within the Empire sterling area only.The attached notes (which are to some extent provisional) have therefore been prepared in order to survey the possibilities of further barter agreements.It will be seen that there is on either side a considerable demand for goods ofthe other and that the basis for such agreements would therefore appear to exist.In considering our method of approach, however, it must be borne in mind thatit would be bad tactics to appear over-anxious to obtain what Russia has to sell,and that, as the question of contraband control is bound to come up in the courseof any conversations, it is better that it should come up on negotiations for whichthe Russians have asked. In this connection it should be recalled that there isan outstanding offer from the Russians to sell us wheat and barley, to which wehave not yet replied, and the fact that this suggestion has been made might perhaps serve as a starting-point for broader discussions with the Russians.It will be seen that, on our side, the limiting factor to barter with theRussians is likely to be the amount of goods we can sell to Russia (probablyabout  10 million per annum on 1937 values, subject to M.E.W. caonsiderations and to shipping questions which have not been considered at this stage) ratherthan the amount we could take from Russia. From this point of view it maybe desirable in the first place to limit any indication of the goods we should like to obtain from Russia to those we need most, particularly timber, flax andhemp, and aluminium.[20186] b 2
Attention is also called to the possibilities resulting from the fact that under her recent Agreement with the Baltic countries Russia extends, andreceives in return, facilities for transit trade. There are goods such as flax,timber and paper-making materials which we are anxious to obtain from theBaltic countries and it would be very useful if arrangements could be made to supplement the difficult route through Sweden and Norway with facilities for mutual trade through northern Russian ports.Board of Trade,October 18, 1939.ANNEX.I. Possible Imports from Russia.(The figures in brackets represent the value of retained imports from theSoviet Union into the United&apos;Kingdom in 1937.)Barley ( 0-5 million)Wheat ( 3-9 million)Raw Cotton ( 700,000)Fur Skins ( 480.000)Paper-making    materials( 58,000)Flax  ( 1-1 million) andTrue HempTimber :Soft     Woodsmillion)Pitprops ( 1-9 million)While the Ministry of Food would in any case beprepared to buy these, if this was desired on political grounds, they would certainly be infavour of doing so if the Russians were preparedto ship them in Russian ships. The Russianwheat crop is reported to be poor.The 1937 import was quite exceptional. The cottonis of the American type and we might take anythey have to offer. We might also be able toobtain some supplies of cotton linters.Total imports amounted to  3-3 million, thedifference being re-exports. This is a mutuallyprofitable trade, and the Russians would probablyregard an assurance that we should not restrict imports and that the London market would remain available to them as a concession in itself.We should not in any case offer to let them haveraw materials in exchange.We should be glad to take anything the Russianscan spare, but they are believed to be shortthemselves.There were no imports from Russia last year, andthere is an embargo at present on the export of flax from Russia. On present values the Ministryof Supply want over four times the amount of the1937 imports, and we should, therefore, be glad to take any flax the Russians can offer. It might also be possible to arrange to obtain flax from theBaltic countries via Russia. We should also beglad to obtain any supplies of true hemp which russia can snare.xWe need timber urgently at present. From thelong-term standpoint, also, imports from russia would avoid shipping and exchange difficulties.Certain of the more valuable kinds continue to be shipped in small quantities from Murmanskthroughout the winter. It is important to startnegotiations in regard to next season&apos;s supplies assoon as possible.
BristlesPetroleummillion.refined   ( .1-4Turpentine ( 78,000)AluminiumTotal imports amounted to  170,000 in 1937 butre-exports exceeded this by  8,000. Supplies areshort and the main source is China. (We alsoobtain bristles from the U.S.A., but these are understood to be largely of Chinese origin.)Re-exports are now controlled by the Board ofTrade.Prom the exchange standpoint it is better to buyfrom Russia than from the U.S.A. or Venezuela.We should also wish to purchase, in order toprevent supplies going to Germany. But it seems that in any case Russia&apos;s requirements exceedher production, except perhaps in lubricating oil which would be particularly useful to us.The Ministry of Supply would be glad to buy any the Russians have to offer.The Russians offered, in August, to resell someAluminum which Ave had sold to them, and theymay have some to spare; if so, we should be glad to get it.Non-ferrous MetalsVanadiumCadmiumNo import figures are available; it has beensuggested that the Russians have some for export and we should be glad to take them.II. Possible Exports from the Empire to Russia.(The figures in brackets are the value of the re-exports fr-om the United kingdom in 1937.)N.B. With the exception of cocoa and tea the Ministry of Economic Warfarewould wish to watch the actual quantities to be exported to Russia in orderto ensure that she did not acquire a surplus to send on to Germany.Cocoa ( 147,000)Tea ( 543,000)    ...Salt HerringsRubber ( 2-7 million)Wool ( 1 -1 million)Lead ( 1-0 million)Nickel ( 1 - 8 million)in ( 3-2 million)We can let Russia have as much as she wants.The Russians probably do not want it as they have their own production and can obtain it from china.We have always found it difficult to get Russia totake these, but, in any case, we might arrange fortheir export to the Baltic countries via Russia.We could let Russia have, say, 30,000 tons annually.We should like to sell this and shortly could letRussia have large quantities, particularly merino.This could be spared.The Russians would probably attach great value toour letting them have nickel, but while there are noobjections from the supply point of view, therewould be exchange objections unless we weresaving dollars on what we obtain from russian return, since the nickel has to be paid for byus in the first place in dollars.The long-term supply position is easy, but theM.E.W. would prefer that it was shipped to vladivostock from Malaya so as to impede any transfer to Germany.
* Jute (23,000 metric tons)   The supply position in India is easy.*Gums :   Tragacanth and   The supply position is easy.Shellac, &amp;o. &quot;(4,000 metric tons)Copper     .........   In the past we have supplied Russia with largequantities of electrolytic. The supply positionrenders any continuation of the trade impossible,though we might be able to substitute some blistercopper if the Russians required it.* From the Eussian Trade Refcurps.
