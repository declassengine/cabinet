This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernmenfSECRETW.P.(G)(39)34 COPY WOg war     C A B I N E TTHE SCOPE AND OR GANISATION OFTHE LliuWlSFlEmnOtlMEMORANDUM by the MINISTER OF information in accordance witll the announcement made by thePrime Minister In the House of Commons on October 3rd, 1939,the News and Censorship Divisions of the Ministry ofInformation ceased to be part of the Ministry as from midnight on October 8-9th, 1939, when Sir Walter Moncktonassumed office as Controller of Censorship.In view of the Debate on the Ministry which theOpposition have put down for Thursday next, I think it rightto explain to the War Cabinet -what exactly the position and functions of the Ministry will be henceforth.    The effect ofthis announcement is to revive, almost unchanged, thearrangements for Publicity and Press Relations which, prevailedin the latter part of the War of 1914/18.The work of censorship and the co-ordination anddistribution of news bulletins, under Sir Walter Monckton,will correspond closely with that of the Official PressBur e au.The Enemy Propaganda branch under Sir CampbellStuart corresponds with Crewe House.Lastly, the responsibility for publicity, both athome and abroad, as distinct from news, which in 1914/18

rested with the Ministry of Information under Lord Beaverbrook,will henceforth rest with the truncated Ministry ofInformation of 1939,It should,*however, be noted that in the last war there was a certain overlap between Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s functions in the hone publicity field and those of the WarAins Committee, a body which, under the control of threeCabinet Ministers, was responsible for political propagandaat hone .The staff of Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s Ministry in 1918was 526, apart from that of the War Aims Committee/.     The staffof the present Ministry at headquarters, after the transfer ofthe News and Censorship Divisions, is about 470s.     As aresult of the review which I am no?/ undertaking, however, I can see my way clear already to make certain reductions of staff and I have others in mind.    But I must retain a sufficient number of qualified staff to cany out adequately the dutiesentrusted to me bv the Cabinet.    I should be misleading them ifI promised very drastic reductions.As I have said, Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s staff was 526,and in comparing the present staff of the Ministry with his,it is important to remember (i) the immense increase in thenature and amount of communications since the last War, inparticular by the introduction of radio;    and (ii) the newxOf this number, 209 are In controlling, administrative or technical grades,  the ba.la.rce of 261 being made up of clerical and typist staff.    A certain number of the higherofficials, including three Directors, are giving their services without pay.

standard of activity which, has been set by the Germans.The Ministry in its new form will be concerned only with the broader aspects of publicity.    Its function will be toensure that the greatest possible amount of publicity is givento the British point of view,  in all its aspects, in all partsof the world.    The reverse side of this function is to ensurethat all German mis-statements are immediately and convincinglydenied and that the denial receives wide currency.That this double task is essential in war time isnot open to question.    That it must be performed &quot;by a singlecentral body, and not by a number of Departments, each concernedwith some entirely different subject as its main function, andwith publicity only as a minor and incidental source is, i suggest, equally important .   Apart from the experience of thelast war, it is clear that without centralisation and unification of control of work of this kind, there will not only be incon-sistency, delay and duplication of effort, but, what is far more important, the machine will be ineffective becauseresponsibility for it will be distributed and not clearly laid upon a single authority.   The German Propagandministerium has a staff of several thousands of persons and a peace-time appropria-tion which has been put as high as  20,000,000 per annum.   Ifthere is to be propaganda at all, we cannot hope to counter theGerman machine, particularly with the start it has alreadygained, if we revert to peace-time decentralisation&apos;.The Ministry will consist of three parts, viz(a) a group of 4 publicity-using Divisions dealing respectivelywith Foreign, Empire, U.S.A. and Home Publicity.    It is this group which is mainly responsible for publicity policy indifferent parts of the world.^) an ancillary group of publicity-producing Divisions, namely,General Production, Films and Radio Relations and Communications.

(c)   Administration, -4-FOREIGN DIVISIONThis Division is organised upon the principlethat each country, or group of countries, presenting specialcharacteristics shall have the attention of one specialistalready equipped with first-hand knowledge of the countryin question,,     It Is the duty of this expert to keep inthe closest possible touch with all movements of publicopinion in the country with which he is concerned, by dailypress summaries received from our Missions abroad, bystudying broadcasts iron the country and enemy broadcastsdirected to it, b3* sustained personal correspondence with official and unofficial residents in the   country, bycontact with nationals of the country residing in London,and by every other possible means.     He is expected to seethat enemy statements are countered and British statementsexplained by telegrams to the Missions, by interviews withthe London representatives of the country&apos;s press, by theinclusion of suitable items in B.B.C, news bulletins broad-cast to the country, by the despatch of suitable pamphletsleaflets and background material to the Press Attache andother agents in the country, as well as by seeing that every possible facility is secured for those who are s endingpublicity material concerning Britain to the country Inquestion by the normal commercial channels.     But for the pressing need for economy, I should have wished to provideat least one full-time specialists for each country.     Infact,  there are more than eighteen, countries which do not get the undivided attention of a member of the staff whileonly one, France, is served by more  than one specialist.The administrative personnel of the Division, which includes

of course the directing and controlling staff as well asthe specialists covering all Allied and neutral countriesexcept the United States, amounts at present to 44.EMPIRE DIVISION.The administrative staff of the Empire Divisionconsists of 13 members.     This Division is also organised on a geographical basis and operates on similar lines,subject to the consideration that the primary responsibilityfor war-time publicity in the oversea countries of theCommonwealth rests with their own governments.     In allthe Dominions^ save Eire, arrangements have been made through the regular channels for continuous co-operationbetween this Ministry and analogous Dominion departments and a similar system of co-operation has been built up,to a greater or lesser extent, with India, Burma and theColonial Empire,     To keep some forty Governments supplied with the publicity material they require, to assist in thepreparation of material representing the British viewpointfor publication through the Empire press, films,  short-waveradio broadcasts and other channels of publicity, and to dealwith general questions such as those of communicationsaffecting publicity of the British cause throughout theEmpire is the primary responsibility of this Division,AMERICAN DIVISION:Before the outbreak:  of war, it was decided by aconference at the Foreign Office, attended by our present-&quot;Ambassador in Washington, that no direct publicity shouldbe undertaken by Britain in the United States of America ,but that the task of presenting Britainrs case should beleft to American   publicity.,     It follows, necessarily,

that the service of British news through Americanchannels must be adequate and continuous, and therefore that all demands   by Americans for information should bepromptly met.The present administrative staff of the Divisionnumbers 6,&apos; with a contemplated reduction to 5,     their service is one of personal contact, and their chief endeavour-vour since September 3rd has been to see that U.S.Correspondents in London are enabled adequately to reportthe British case.     The American Division is also concernedwith the British attitude to America;   and for this purposehas to watch the press, to read a great deal of materialprepared in draft by other Divisions, and to make sure that inaccurate and risky comment is not allowed to passuncorrected.     The American Division is the main channelthrough which information regarding America reaches other divisions, and supplements the Foreign Office in supplyingthis information to other Government Departments.I should be prepared to admit that if the AmericanDivision stood alone, its functions are not strikinglyindifferent from those of the American Department of theForeign Office.     But it is a very small Division;    I doubt if any saving would be made by transferring it toDowning Street, and it is clearly preferable, on groundsboth of principle and of convenience, to retain it aspart of the Ministry.

HOME DIVISIONI have no intention of conducting a propaganda campaign&quot;in Great Britain.     But it is a mistake to thinkthat publicity, even at home, can be left to run Itself.Even in peace this has been recognised on all sides:Government departments have for years been conductingpublicity in order to achieve the effective co-operation ofthe public in departmental policy.     No matter how readyunofficial agencies are to collaborate with the Government,some machinery must exist to explain to those agencies thepolicy and requirements of the Government.     The same principle applies to national publicity in time of war; and whatever is to be done, must be done from the Ministrysince there is no other Department which is concerned withpublicity of this kind.     The arguments in favour ofcentralisation of control, used in paragraph 2, page 3, apply with equal force here.     It may be that a reduction in thepresent figure of 24 administrative staff is practicable,though I am not yet in a position to guarantee this.The four Publicity-using Divisions which have been described require in the course of their work largequantities of publicity material of different kinds.     Muchof the material required by one Division will also be suitable for use by other Divisions.     Accordingly, the view taken by those responsible for the planning of the Ministryhas been that, to achieve economy and prevent duplication of effort, the organs for the actual output of publicity shouldbe centralised in three Divisions, namely:-

(1)    General Production.(2)   Film Publicity.(3)   Radio Relations and Communications.I am now engaged on a review of these Divisions,and meanwhile I propose to keep an open mind on thisquestion.     For the purpose of this paper I give theorganisation and staff as they stand at present.The General Production Division, with an administrative and technical staff of 30, is responsiblefor the writing and production of all printed matter,articles, pamphlets, leaflets, books, posters, etc., to meetthe requirements of the four primary Divisions.     In additionto a small number of writers on the staff, the Division callson the services of many journalists and authors who arespecialists on the subjects on which they are asked to write.Through this Division the Ministry calls to its aidprofessional advertising firms which specialise in the formof publicity which it is decided to employ.     At present a newspaper advertising campaign is being worked out whichwill deal, amongst others, with the following subjects:-&quot;The Empire&apos;s Strength and Resources&quot;&quot;Our Industrial Resources and Policy&quot;&quot;The Policy of Increasing Food Production at Home&quot;&quot;The Part our Navy plays in securing our economic strength&quot;&quot;Our Economic Strength and Resources&quot;and2 advertisements designed to combat waste2 advertisements on rationing.The Ministry of Agriculture has sought the aid ofthis Division in carrying out the campaign to stimulate thehome production of food.

24-It will be recognised therefore that this division is doing technical work which would have to be doneby other departments of the Government,, probably at greatercost, through the Stationery Office or otherwise, if it werenot done here.Photographs, official and other, for use in the lesser newspapers and periodicals abroad, are also supplied by this Division.The Division has been staffed throughout by personswho in peace-time are employed by private firms in handlingpublicity problems.The Films Division, whose administrative staff isat present 9, is devoting its energies to utilising thecinema screens of the world,  some 90,000 in number, for thepurpose of presenting pictorially to the many millions whovisit these cinemas the case for the democracies.     Normally,some 20,000,000 people attend the 5,000 cinemas in thiscountry each week.It is the intention to use the &quot;world-wide machineryof the existing trade organisations to the fullest extentfor the production, distribution, and theatrical exhibitionof films of value from the national standpoint, and to supplement this theatrical distribution by means of non-theatrical exhibition wherever possible and necessary,through specially organised channels.The Division has already been successful in makingcontact with, and securing the fullest co-operation from,all sections of the British Cinematograph Industry, producersdistributors, exhibitors, and News Reel Companies alike.

It has also been engaged, in consultation with the Board ofTrade, in considering, with reference to the quotaprovisions of the Cinematograph Films Act, 1838, how best to ensure the maintenance in time of war of a flourishingfilm production industry in this country.The Radio Relations and Communications Division isa small Division consisting of S administrative staff andhas charge of all communications problems of the Ministry,of relations with the 3.3.C.. and of the exploration of suchbroadcasting opportunities as arc beyond the scope of the3. B.C. through a special organisation known as the JointBroadcasting Committee, part of the cost of which is charged to Secret Service funds.    In war, direct government publicity designed to maintain the morale of the public may,with little warning, become urgently necessary.The relations of the Division with the B.B.C. are important, but hard to define precisely.     They includeboth policy and finance.   The. B.B.C. fully recognise that intime of war their relations with the Government must be farcloser than in peace.     While the Government have no desireto control the B. B.C.  (nor indeed any power to dc so saveby taking over all their property completely in an extremeemergency), the Corporation are willing and, indeed, anxiousto consult the Government on the many points of policy whichconstantly arise;    these consultations normally take placethrough the Division.     The Division is also responsible, inconsultation with the Administration Division, for negotiating with the Corporation the figures of estimated expenditure onwhich the Treasury shall be asked to approve the

parliamentary Grant to the Corporation under v;ar conditions.Including the cost of services (foreign broadcasts, and the&quot;monitoring&quot; of broadcasts from foreign stations) the whole cost of which is recouped to the Corporation from public funds.As regards communications, the Division is responsible for such important matters as negotiations onfinance and services with Reuters and the Cable companies,and with the Post Office and other Departments concerned for improving telephone and other forms of communicationoverseas in order to facilitate the transmission of publicity material from this country.ADMINISTRATION DIVISIONThis Division, with an administrative staff of23, is responsible for (i) Finance, including Accounts;(ii) Establishment matters; and (iii) General administrationquestions, such as Parliamentary Questions, the briefing ofMinisters for Debates, preparation   of Cabinet Memoranda,correspondence-with other Government Departments, etc.It is to be expected that the transfer of the news and Censorship Divisions will result in some reduction ofStaff in this Division,  so far as my own responsibility isconcerned.     On the other hand the Treasury have asked, andI have arreed, that the Division shall assist Sir &quot;-alterlionckt0,11, by acting as his agent in matters not involvingfinance or policy, e.g. Establishment, Paymaster and A.R.P.services, end the prevision of clerical and typing assistancein time of pressure.     In practice, therefore, it is unlikely that the numbers will be susceptible of much, if

any, reduction.I am considering the inclusion in this Divisionof the work of collecting information on the state of publicopinion in this and other countries, and of providing a daily summary of the Home Press, which has hitherto beenperformed under a separate Director of Intelligence with an administrative staff of 28.     I am satisfied some of thework which has been done is valuable, but I find that itwas organised on a needlessly elaborate scale, and byeliminating certain functions,  I hope to be able to effect a considerable reduction in the size of staff required.conclusion the object of this memorandum is to ask for thegeneral approval of the Cabinet for the maintenance of aMinistry of Information for the broad purposes and on thegeneral lines set out sbove.     I am not asking for approvaleither for the numbers employed or for the exact organisationat present existing.     Both of these are under the most careful scrutiny at the moment, and the scrutiny extends toa matter which would not ordinarily come before the Cabinet,the question whether, in all cases, the personnel of theright kind, to obtain the ends in view, has, in every case,been secured.(Intd)     MINISTRY OF INFORMATION8th October 1939J
