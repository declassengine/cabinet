(59)8o COPY NO. 5 *y./ WAR CABINET.PROCEDURE.Note by the Prime Minister..I have had under consideration the question of theextent to which War Cabinet Minutes and Memoranda may properly be shown by Cabinet Ministers to their subordinates -The rule that Cabinet papers of the &quot;Lock and Key&quot;category may be shown by Ministers, in their discretion,to their Ministerial subordinates and their responsibleexpert Service advisers but to no other persons, may?I think9 be applied to War Cabinet Papers-,      L regard it,however? as very important that it should be clearly understood that Ministers to whom these documents are circulated in the first instance should exercise a very real discretion in this matter.     No War Cabinet paper should be shown to any individual except on the directauthority of the Minister receiving it and Ministers mustbe personally responsible for any authority that is given.Ministers will appreciate that these precautions are ofgreat importance in view of the exceptionally secretcharacter of many of the War Cabinet documents and ofthe very grave consequences which might follow from thepublication of their contents.(Initialled) N.C.
