IIS DOCUMjT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.COPY NO.WAR      CABINETTHE URGENT FREIGHT REQUIREMENTS OF THEMINISTRY OF FOOD.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.1,     I have read the Memorandum by the First Lord(W.P.(g)(39) 37) on &quot;The urgency of charteringneutral tonnage&quot;, and I should like to follow up his suggestions with a statement of the position as it is seen from the Ministry of Food.2,     The Ministry of Food is now the sole purchaser ofcereals and cereal products for shipment to thiscountry.      In normal times the import of grain occupiesa very large part not only of British but also offoreign tonnage.      The Ministry is, therefore, atpresent in the market for a very large part of theavailable tonnage, both British and neutral,  and thattonnage is being chartered for it by the Freight Depart-ment of the Ministry of Food subject to the arrangementsmade by the Board of Trade and Ministry of Shipping.3.     When stock was taken of the position at the end ofSeptember as regards the movement to this country ofthe grain already purchased,  it was found that thetotal tonnage chartered for cereals and cereal products to arrive by the 30th November showed a deficit againstthe amount of these commodities which would be consumed,in that period, of 981,000 tons, or nearly five weeks&apos;consumption.      In other words, it was apparent thatif no   more freight is made available our stocks of grainwould by the end of November be diminished by an amount equal to nearly five weeks&apos; supply.      In the circumstances it was necessary to obtain grain from the nearestsources of supply and in particular from the St. Lawrencebefore the close of navigation.4-0     Urgent representations were immediately made to the1.

Board of Trade to provide 500,000 tons of freightto carry Canadian wheat to arrive by the end ofNovember, and the Board of Trade made strenuous efforts to meet this requirement so far as ispossible within the limitations of the present arrangements.The provision of this tonnage still leaves, however,a deficit of 1+81,000 tons, mainly maize and barley,,and the maize and barley position is really desperate.Prom all quarters we receive warnings that it willscon be necessary to slaughter livestock for thewant of food, and the manufacturers of maize starchand glucose, which are used extensively in munition factories, are about to close down.      The Ministryof Shipping have, therefore, been pressed to providea further 200,000 tons of space for arrival before november 30th, making 700,000 additional tons in all bythat date, and we arc hoping that we shall be able tocover the balance of the requirements of food grainsby using home-grown wheat.      This, however, will involve a fall in the stocks of bread grain, whichin view of the general shipping situation is notpleasant, and indeed adds gravely to the risk ofthe situation,5.     Accordingly, we have now put in a further request for tonnage, which is,  if we are to tide overthe period to November 30th, that we require arrivalsin December amounting to 1,081,000 tons (a figure of800,000 tons plus 281 ,000 tons carried forward).      I.now learn, however,  that the chances of our receivingthis space or indeed of receiving the total of 700,000tons required for the period to November 30th, are verysmall.2.

The basis of 800,000 tons of cereals (which has beentaken for the month of December), is a low figure forconsumption of imported cereals, and making allowance for some possible increase in normal consumption inwartime and for sinkings, the monthly freight re-requirement is about 1,000,000 tons.The method of control of shipping, namely bylicensing, direction and fixing rates for the carriage of Government cargoes, seems to involve an element of time which makes difficult the provisionof British tonnage step by step with the urgent rquirements of the purchasing Departments.As regards the neutrals, the Freight Department ofthe Ministry of Food is not permitted to charterthem at freights above certain levels.      Neutrslships can earn much more remunerative freights bycarrying cargoes betv/een neutral countries so that most of them refuse to offer themselves to us at thecontrol rates.      Meanwhile, we have cheap barley inMorocco and neutral ships nearby which are preparedto bring the barley here at rates which would still leave the c,i,f, rates well below what Canadianbarley costs us, but the freight rates are above the permitted rates.      We have wheat in the River Plate andfew British ships to lift it.      There are many Greekvessels on the spot and the cost of Plate wheat iswell below that of Canadian wheat.      We are underobligation to ship wheat and maize to Eire, but for lack of tonnage we cannot fully meet that obligation.The Eire Government may soon begin making their own arrangements regardless of the effect upon the FreightMarket.

8The key to the whole iamiediaoe situation is theneutral tonnage and it may well be doubted whether we shall be able to feed this country withoutneutral ships.In the last war practically allneutral vessels were time-chartered to the Ministryof Shipping from 1917 onwards to the end of thewar.9.     It is essential to act quickly in this matter asstocks of cereals are running down and neutral tonnage shows no signs of becoming available.If, for instance, the large block of Greek tonnagenow in position to bring grain from the Plate could,as any exceptional measure, be taken for the homewardvoyage, that step would do something to alleviate the cereals position.      It does not necessarily follow thatsuch a step will prejudice any general policy to beadopted as regards time-chartering,10,,     It is no exaggeration to say that the safety of thecountry is at stake unless by one means or anothera great volume of additional tonnage is madeavailable for the carriage of cereals without de-completing the amount of tonnage required for shipment of other foodstuffs.W. S.  MORRISON.Ministry of Pood.October 18th. 1939.
