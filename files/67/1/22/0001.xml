TTrr.q IXiCUHENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.WAR CABINET. .COPY MO. &apos;&quot;l-&quot;q3)22.THE CALLING UP OF MEN FOR THE ARMED FORCES.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE.The War Cabinet will wish to be informed of the   steps which are beingtaken with regard to the calling up of men for the Armed Forces.About 145,000 militiamen are being called up between the beginning ofOctober and the middle of November.     This will exhaust the supply of militia-men and it will therefore be necessary to take early steps to proclaim the nextage group, the 21-22 class.     In order to include those men who have reached theage of 20 since 3rd June (the date of registration of the militiamen), it isproposed to proclaim liable for service men who on the date of the Proclamationhad reached 20 years of age and had not attained the age of 22.     Men previouslyregistered will, of course, not be required to register again.The date of the Proclamation is the operative date as regards the age ofthe men concerned and administratively the most convenient date is 1st October.This is a Sunday and is the day set aside as a Day of National Prayer.     As I felt that it might be considered inappropriate to issue a Proclamation calling up the first age group under the Armed Forces Act on such a day, I consulted the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose view was that far from being inappropriatehe thought it would have a special significance.     I also consulted theModerator of the Free Churches, who agreed with the Archbishop&apos;s view.     steps are accordingly being taken for the Proclamation to be issued on that day.The men will be registered on Saturday, 2lst October, and will then be called .for medical examination so that they will begin to be available for enlistmentin November.It is estimated that approximately 250,000 men will be required to registeras a result of the Proclamation.     Deducting medical rejects, conscientious objectors, exempted classes and men covered by the schedule of reserved occupations, it is anticipated that the numbers available for the,Armed forces are likely to be in the neighbourhood of 200,000.(int.)
