THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1939.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (39) 31.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK/AND KEY.It is requested that special care pay be taken toensure the secrecy of this/document war CABINET.POLISH REFUGEE PROBLEM.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I HAVE to inform my colleagues of the action which I have taken inpursuance of the Conclusions of the War Cabinet (36 (39) ) of the 4th October(Minute 9) regarding the problem of Polish refugees.In accordance with Conclusion (a) of that minute I have ascertained thatthe French Government have received no appeals on behalf of Polish refugees and have therefore not considered the problem. This can only mean that voluntaryFrench associations and the Polish authorities in France are tackling the problemwithout official assistance.As regards Conclusion (6), the question of formulating a plan for makinguse of Polish man-power is under consultation with the various GovernmentDepartments concerned.In pursuance of Conclusion (c). I asked Sir Francis Humphrys to come and see me on the 11th October and enquired whether he would be willing toassist His Majesty&apos;s Government in connexion with the Polish refugee problem.I explained to him that the Poles who had fled from Polish territory constituted a diversity of problems according to the categories in which they were placed.The question of those who were destined for service in the Polish Legion orin the Allied armed forces was one for the French Government and the service departments, and would probably not concern him. He would also probably not be brought very much into the question of those among the refugees qualified for industrial service. But over and above these there was the large problemof the refugees for whom no opening could be found at present, and as these were the subject of much representation from the Polish Government and thePolish Ambassador, and raised problems affecting various departments, it seemedessential that there should be one recognised authority with whom cases couldbe raised, and who might be responsible under the Foreign Office for co-ordinating the necessary action with Cabinet Ministers and other authorities concerned.There wTas also the question of co-ordinating British charitable effort in this connexion, and here too there were problems affecting the Treasury and ColonialOffice in particular which appeared to need one authority so that a uniformpolicy could be pursued.Sir Francis Humphrys agreed to undertake this work, and. his appointmenthaving been approved by my colleagues, I would propose to give him a roomin the Foreign Office, with secretarial assistance, and then inform the variouspublic and private bodies concerned that questions affecting Polish refugees maybe addressed in the first instance to Sir Francis Humphrys, who has been charged by His Majesty&apos;s Government with the supervision of this problem.&apos;    * FIForeign Office, October 12, 1939.10626   [20123]
