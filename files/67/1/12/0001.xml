percent.Tir.rRWT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S ^GOVERNMENT).1   yr.:&apos;::    &apos;Copy No. 12-/12.WAR CABINETThe question of responsibility for the supply of newsto the public \\\Memorandum by the Minister of Information.j   My experience.in.the short time since-I took up office hasconvinced me that if the Ministry of Information is to play thepart which has been laid down for it in the prosecution of theWar - and in my opinion it is a part which is essential to finalvictory - there must be a fundamental change in the relationsbetween it and the Departments of State which are mainly responsible for the conduct of the war       The present situationis intolerable, and I feel bound to report the facts very franklyto the War Cabinet.2.      In theory the Minister of Information is responsible forthe supply to the Press and the public of all Government news,statements and announcements       In practice he is not responsible,for two reasonsJ-(i)    First, because the Service Departments claim thatit lies with them only to decide that information of a militarynature must not be published, lest it endanger the safety of the realm.(ii) Secondly, because the Minister does not know thenecessary facts.      He and his officers are not being given theinformation which it is essential that he should have in his possession before he decides what it is right to publish; after taking into account all the interests involved.3-      It is commonly said that in judging whether a certainPiece of information may or may not be published, the paramountconsideration is the safety of the realm       That is of coursetrue, but it is often forgotten that in a war such as this the safety of the realm depends, not upon military  considerationsonly? but upon the courage and resolution and the will to victory0f tlle whole nation;    and that if these are undermined, the/safety

safety of the realra may be endangered far more gravely than bythe disclosure of secrets from which the enemy may conceivably(but by no means wi^.1 necessarily) obtain solne &quot;military; advantage.4.      During the last week it has been impressed upon me from a number of sources that the present lack of information about the War is having a serious effect upon people&apos;s minds.At home they are both irritated and bored, to put it no higher.The Ministry is suffering grave-disrepute..and though the reputation of the individuals concerned does not greatly matter, the consequent loss of reputation to the Govern-raent is serious.      Abroad the evidence is overwhelming that the lack of information from British sources is leaving the dooropen for the entry of a mass of German news, freely and lavishlysupplieds with no apparent check due to the censorship, full ofinterest to the neutral reader, and. all of course tending to convey the impression that a German victory is certain andshould be welcomed by the neutral nations.5*    I do not wish to exaggerate the position,,  I fullyrealise that behind all these complaints there lies the wishto receive, not any, news which the L-feLnistry of Information maypublish, but the news for which all are eagerly waiting; news of active British participation in hostilities, both on air,sea and land.    It is the absence of this news which makespeople at home and our friends abroad, restless and anxious,and in their anxiety it is natural for them to make the Ministryof information their whipping, boy.    Much of the presentirritation with the Ministry will disappear if we are able togive the public good news of this kind.    But it will, not dis-aPpear, on the contrary it will greatly increase, if when theftews that British forces are engaged with the enemy does come,,the Ministry is still compelled to present it to the public underthe restrictive conditions which now hamper it on every sidea6.      These restrictions have hindered the proper working of

;ne Censorship d^iyi^exploiting. as well-as-of-the-N-ews Division,There have been certain delays due to faults in the internalworking of the Censorship machine - faults which I trust that weare now in process of correcting,,    But a large part of the blamewhich has attached to the Censorship lias been due to causes over which the&apos; Ministry has hitherto had no control - namely the long delay before a decision can be obtained from the Service Depart-ments on any question of doubt which has been referred to themby the Chief Censor,    I am satisfied that this state of thingscannot be allowed to continue, and that there must be a change which will enable the Ministry of Information to decide suchmatters itself with the least possible delay,7*      In order to enable the Ministry to function as itshould, and as I have pledged myself, both in Ferliament and tothe Press? that I shall see that it does function, I ask for two things,(i) First,  that the principle shall be clearly recognisedthat it is for the Minister? and not for the Service Departments.,to decide whether a particular piece of information shall or shall not be published.The issue of information, or the suppression ofinformation through the Censorship, is the responsibility of theMinister of Information in the same sense as the Colonies are theresponsibility of the Colonial Secretary,    His position on a.question of publication is constitutionally the same as that ofthe Colonial Secretary on a question of Colonial Trade polieyoThe Colonial Office is responsible, but they must first consult the Board of Trade; and if the two cannot agree, the matter mustbe decided by the Cabinet.-    But the Board of Trade pannot vetothe Colonial Secretary J:s proposals from the outset.(ii) Secondly, in order that he may judge whether a particularPiece of information ought or ought not to be published, theminister must know all the relevant facts.    Unless he is aware/of

- h -of what is being done, and also of what is proposed, by theService authorities, he cannot adequately carry out his duties,either of Censorship or of the Supply of News,    He becomesmerely a postman, who delivers to the public the letters whichhe has been handed at the post office, but knows nothing oftheir contents.8.      If these principles are approved, I would proposeto put them into practice as follows, in the CensorshipDivision and the News Division respectively.The Ministers in charge of the three service departments have already been good enough to nominate three service Officers of high rank, who will be attached to theMinistry and will work under my orders.    It will be their duty:(a) to give me and the Chief Censor under me, advice on the military aspect of any censorship question that may arise;(b) to be the channel by which confidentialW*r-^JmommHiiiH........inn i-&apos;TinninT mi i , - ,, ,ir )f,i,,Viinformation is communicated to me by the Service Departments-,ln.,ll...... H.,.1,1 .....II   II    I&apos;.....for the purpose of enabling my Department both to exercise its functions of censorship properly, and to supply the publicwith news of the kind and in the form which I think properto publish.Procedure in the Censorship Division.9.    Henceforward, the Chief Censor will, on any questionof doubt, consult one or other of these Advisers instead ofreferring the matter to the Service Departments.    If they agreewith his view, he will act upon it immediately/   If theydisagree, he will refer the matter to the appropriate -higher authority within the. Ministry,  who   before reaching a decisionF1 1 hear the views of the Adviser or Advisers concerned, and will

tneri* at his clisb^etion, either decide the question himself orrefer it to the Minister for final decision.Procedure in the Hews Division.10.    It is an essential part of my proposals that theSerVice and other Departments concerned shall in future be willing to supply the responsible officers of the Hews Divisionwith all the relevant news of. each jlay that is in their possession.    Proper liaison arrangements must be made for this,with which I need not trouble the V/ar Cabinet.    But the pointI wish to emphasize is that the News Division of the Ministrymust not, as hitherto has been the case, be left waiting until the Service Department chooses to remember its existence and to supply it with a morsel of food to keep it from starving.    The Departments must give it a choice ofviands of all kinds, whether palatable or not, whatever theyhave available;    and it must be for the Ministry to pick andchoose among this varlet3*&quot; of edibles which it will decide to^rcrunt to the public, and which--it will rorjoct.11.    It will of course be for the Departments to indicate;in supplying&quot;this variety of information, which items they are -particularly anxious not to see published,,    And the ministry would of course overrule this request at their peril.    But i must contend that the final decision on these matters, subjectto proper safeguards, lies with the Minister and not with theDepartments.12.    The safeguards which I propose are the same as those set out in paragraph 9 in the case of the Censorship.    The NewsDivision, having decided what information it vis in theiropinion desirable to publish, will submit their bulletin indraft to the Chief Censor, who will then,  if there is anyquestion of doubt in his mind, consult the Service Advisers./If

18th September, 1939.IL tUe latter fail -bo agree, the matter -will be submitted, asin the case of any other Censorship question, to the Newsontroller, and by him if necessary to the Minister.13.     If these arrangements are approved and put into force,gnd if I may ,De assured D- &quot;khe goodwill of the Service Departments,iitliout which I cannot hope to obtain the abundant supply of newsl/hieh the public appetite demands, then I am hopeful that theMinistry will be able to play a valuable part in the War.Lq..     I need hardly add that I am fully sensible of the great^responsibility which would rest upon me and upon the more highly-olacecl officers under me if the Cabinet should approve my proposals.It is true that in theory I could, if necessary, or if called uponto clo so by another Department whose interests were affected, submit the matter to the &apos;ar Cabinet before talcing action.      But in^practice time would scarcely ever permit this to be done, unless thejtabinet should happen to be sitting at the time:    the most that Imould, hope for would be direct personal consultation with the other minister concerned, and pe:..haps in an extreme case with the Prime^Minister himself.      In matters of news publicity, as Members of the bar Cabinet will know well, time is of the essence of the contract:a delay of even a few minutes may make all the difference to the newspaper concerned, and lead to the Iocs of the goodwill towardscu:&apos; cause of all its readers.      I can only say that it will be my^constant endeavour to exercise t is great responsibility with a dueipsard to all the various aspects of the national interest involved,W1 - that, provided I am given the confidential information for which&quot;      ant- am enabled to take counsel with responsible and experienced officers of the Service Departments on all questions ofv -doubt, 1 see no reason why the Service Departments should fear theI result of such an arrangement.
