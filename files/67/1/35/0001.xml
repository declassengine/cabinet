. pppnjjgWT IS THE PROPERTY OF KI3 BRITAINIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).^ Copy No. Z.war    CABINET.DIVERSION    OF    SHIPPING.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport,aing)ding)1.     The Committee of Imperial Defence decided at their meetings on April 20th and May 29th that&apos;:-(a) in view of the difficulties and delays, both indischarge and distribution,  that must inevitably be caused by any substantial measure of diversion of overseas imports to ports other than their normaldischarging ports, the general principle for dealingwith such imports in time of war should be to make thegreatest possible use of normal facilities untilprevented from doing so by enemy naval or air action,congestion at the ports or inland,  or by supplyconditions;(b) in view of the probable heavy attack on London and theEast Coast in the initial stages of a war and the consequent damage to shipping and difficulties of portworking,  ocean-going ships normally proceeding to london or the East Coast ports generally at or just before theoutbreak of hostilities should be diverted to westernports,  or held in relatively safe anchorages pending thedevelopment of the situation.2.      This policy was put into effect on September 1st andhas continued in varying degrees according to the advice receivedfrom time to time from the Admiralty.Broadly speaking, diversion has been applied tohomeward bound British ocean-going ships from North and south atlantic and the Mediterranean.    In an increasing number of cases,complete discharge has taken place at one port.    This has twoadvantages - the avoidance of the additional risks involved inthe ship continuing her usual itinerary to other ports and the probability of a quicker turn-round.3.      So far, no serious difficulty has been experienced inaccommodating diverted ships in West Coast ports - mainly becauseof the relatively small number of vessels involved.    Normalarrivals have been delayed for a number of reasons (e.g. closing of Mediterranean, preliminary delays in forming convoys), but now that the convoy system is in full operation,  there will be agreater flow of incoming ships.4.      The general effect of diversion has been that East

- 2 -Coast ports - particularly London - have been working well below their normal level,  while those on the West have varied upwards 01downwards from normality.According to the daily reports received from theprincipal ports,  the Tyne and Kumber are new slack or very slackexcept for coal export trade.    The East Coast ports in particularhave felt the effect of the cessation of the Baltic, Scandinavianand Russian trade,London has rather more than half the normalnumber of ships in port but the number of large ships is aboutnormal;  this is accounted for by the fact that certain of thelarger ships are being held in London to complete their defensive armament aSouthampton, Avonmouth and the South Wales ports arebusy, owing chiefly to War Office user,Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and the other West coast ports will probably have filled up by the end of October with normal arrivals and diverted ships.    Thereafter,, diversion from east to West will become increasingly difficult,  if seriouscongestion is to be avoided.5.     Any increase of deep-water berthage accommodation atWest Coast ports can only be secured on the basis of a long-term programme spread over a number of years; and no proposals arebeing made for extensive works of new construction apart from theprovision of additional facilities for handling oil at Avonmouth,Swansea and Manchester (Stanlow).6.      On the other hand,  active steps have been taken toincrease the facilities for the rapid discharge of ships in port.Additional cranes    and dock railway sidings are being provided and large supplies of spare replacement parts are being stocked forthe speedy repair of facilities damaged by enemy action.7.      Storage presents a separate problem.    The portEmergency Committees constituted at the principal commercial portshave been given wide powers to secure the rapid clearance of goods

(Initialled) E.W.Ministry of Transport.18th October.  1959.from quays and transit sheds.    The underlying principle is thatthe storage accommodation in a port shall be used for transitpurposes and not for warehousing.The Ministries of Supply and of Food are seeking(through the Office of Works) inland warehouse accommodation away from the ports to which the commodities with which they areconcerned can be sent direct from the port for  distribution tothe final destinations.    As a long-term programme,  these two departments are considering the adaptation of suitable premises and the provision of new buildings for storage purposes,8.      The nexus between the ports and the different formsof transport is secured by the appointment to the Port emergency committees of representatives of road,  railway, coastwise shipping and, where appropriate,  canal transport.    Direct contact is thusestablished with the organisations of the Regional (Road)Transport Commissioner,  the Railway Executive Committee,  the coasting Shipping War Control Committees (set up by the Boardof Trade) and the Canals.    I have no reason to doubt theefficiency of this machinery which,  although not as yetsubjected to severe pressure, has functioned smoothly sincethe outbreak of war.
