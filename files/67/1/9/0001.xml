COPY NO,WAR CABINET.EFFICACY OF PRESENT PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGNUNDERTAKEN IN GERMANY THROUGH THE agency of THE ROYAL AIR FORCE.Memorandum/by the. Minister .of Information(At the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 11thSeptember, (War Cabinet 11 (39) Conclusion 2) I was invited toprepare a Report, in the light of all available information;on the effioac ;* of  the present propaganda campaign undertaken in Germany through the agency of the Royal Air Force02. In the preparation of this Report, the opinions ofthe Foreign Office, the Air Stafff, and Sir Campbell Stuarthave be,en collated-,3, Direct Evidence from Germany^    The areas covered by our aircraft so far have been the industrial West and NorthWest of. Germany and the hinterland as far East as the general line Hanover-Kassel,46 It has not been possible, up to the present, toascertain from any quarter in Germany, including our secret service, what reaction there has been to our leaflets, withthe exception of certain limited reports from neutral countriesThese are further examined below (parasB 10 and 11),5*        On the other hand, it is significant that GeneralGoering turned to the theme of Leaflet Propaganda at severalPoints in his speech on Saturday, the 9th September.     Hethen spoke as follows:&quot;If the British aeroplanes fly at tremendous heightsat night and drop t-heir ridiculous propaganda on German-1-TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.

territory, I have nothing against it.     But take care.     Ifthe leaflets are succeeded by one bomb, then reprisals will follow and will be carried out as in Poland&quot; (Times reportof speech, Monday 11th September)&amp;6*        It is probably a fair deduction that, since thisspeech was broadcast and was addressed to the German people as a whole, the story of the leaflets has not been confinedentirely to the areas over which they, were dropped.7.        On the other hand in contradiction of MarshalGoer&apos;ingfs flamboyant statement 14$ the following report received by our Naval Attache in the Netherlands from anofficer on the Dutch staff? Netherlands, to the effect that&quot;the Germans had imposed a fine of 500 marks on anyone (withthe exception, it is understood, of children up to the ageof 10) who picked up a pamphlet, and the Death penalty foranyone found reading one&quot; 0   Moreover, Sir Neville Bland, our minister at the Hague, in his telegram to the Foreign Officeof the 10th instant quotes from expressions of opinion ofpersons recently returned from Germany, or who are in touchwith such persons - &quot;Germans must immediately surrenderpamphlets and are heavily fined for reading thenu   Some left in frontier area were surprised when pamphlets fell insteadof bombs&quot;.8. Again, the German broadcast in German on the 7thinstant betrayed uneasiness:    the broadcast analysed our propaganda methods, indicating that they were typical of theold Northcliffe game in the last war, but that now germany could protect herself*    In view of Hitler?s references in&quot;Mein Kampf&quot; to the great success of Lord Nothercliffe&apos;spropaganda methods, the reference to Lord Northcliffe now isnot without significance.   It should be noted that the abovereferences give all that we have of the official German view.They do not throw any light on the effect of our leafletpropaganda on the millions of plain Germans in the street.

indirect Evidence or Inferenceso9.     The Ministry have consulted certain individuals or membersof groups of highly intelligent German refugees in this country.Their view is as follows:    while there is not likely to he animmediate harvest from this form of propaganda it may hearfruit hereafter, particularly when Germany has experienced defeatsin the field, economic stringency, or other adversities.Views of Neutrals on Efficacy of the Leaflet Propaganda.10. Sir Neville Bland reporting to the Foreign Office.from,the Hague on the 10th instant telegraphs as follows:-&quot;Intelligence Section of General Staff have informed military attache that in their opinion pamphlets have done more harm than good.     Another Dutch official told Military Attache that therewas considerable body of opinion here that British are not doingenough.     We should bomb hard, not only drop pamphlets&quot;.    lord lothian telegraphing from Washington on the 11th instant, while not specifically mentioning the pamphlet propaganda, states that&quot;several newspapers from all parts of the country are insinuatingthat we are not seriously attempting to assist Poland in herextremity and are toying with the idea of an early anddiscreditable peace.       On the other hand the more reputablepapers today are impressed by British preparation for three yearswar.      It is thought that we might do more bombing from the air,and too few people appreciate that our self-denial in this respectis in part at any rate in response to the President&apos;s own appeal&quot;.Sir E. Monson telegraphing from Stockholm on the 11th instantstates:-    &quot;I am very seriously concerned at the decline inprestige of His Majesty&apos;s Government since outbreak of war.....Grudging belief that the Allies do not mean business on western front and suprise at their failure to relieve pressure on Poland&quot;by attacking Germany from the air.      This belief is encouraged by

the continuous dropp^mg of leaflets which in Swedishview, betrays(word indecipherable ?lacic of knowledge)of German people, v/ho whatever their attitude totheir own Government may have been before the outbreakof war, are likely to be loyal now&apos; that war has begun.I should point out in this connection that the Swedesknow their Germans pretty well&quot;.11.       It is further learned from confidental contactsthat Dutch, Slovak, Lithuanian and Latvian journalistsdo not think the leaflets very effective.   They mighthave been effective had Germany&apos;s Polish victoriesnot been so rapid.    American correspondents refer tothe bad effect of the first leaflet in the referencetherein - &quot;Was Germany not allowed ... to achieve theAnchluss, and to take back the Sudetan Germans inpeace?   Neither we nor any other nation would have sought to limit her advance, so long as she did notviolate independent non-German peoples&quot;.    The bad effect meant is that on Czecho-Slovax and Austrianopinion in America, and therefore presumably in thosecountries themselves.    The reference looked like asurrendering of their interests.(12) Effect on French Opinion.Sir S.Phipps&apos;  telegram to the Foreign Office of the9th instant referred to the adverse reactions ofFrench opinion to the mere dropping of leaflets at thepresent date, and that good opportunities to bomb military objectives might have been missed.    On the other handin the same telegram he points out that in the early days of the war the French press had commentedfavourably on the dropping of pamphlets in Germany bythe H.A.F.A

13.        The Air Staff advise that they have noindependent information about Germany&apos;s reaction to these flights, hut from the operational pointof view the flights have been of considerable value in giving experience in night reconnaissance and navigation over unknown territory to oursquadrons,  and they have also served from the intelligence point of view in giving us some information regarding the night defence organizationof the part of Germany covered.14. The evidence is therefore conflicting, andit is difficult to arrive at a conclusion withoutknowing;(i)whether the Air Staff would wish, on operationalgrounds,  to see the flights continued,  or whether they feel that by now they have served their purpose in providing experience and information;    and(ii) how soon the RoA^F. are likely to begin war-likeoperations in the West,On these points the War Cabinet will doubtlessseek further information from the Chief of the Air Staff.15.        It seems clear from the evidence furnished bythe Foreign Office that what has most painfully impressedobservers in neutral countries,  and indeed in our own,  isthe fact that this &quot;leaflet war&quot; appears to be all thatthe British Air Force is being called upon to contribute to the struggle,  and beyond this we seem to be doing nothing to succour our friends or attack our enemies..It seems probable that mush of this criticism will disappear once it is Known that the R.A.Fo is playing its full part in combatant warfare.

16. Meanwhile Sir Campbell Stuart thinks that it wouldbe a mistake to discontinue or reduce the volume of ourpresent leaflet campaign.     Moreover, if we aresubsequently to conduct a regional campaign, from whichimportant results may ensue, the suspension of our normalactivities would prejudice the chances of its success.17. It is outside the scope of this paper to discussthe form which the campaign might take in future, if Itshould be decided to continue it0 But it was the viewgenerally expressed to the foreign Office from manysources before the war that the Germans were hungry for/ facts;      and it would seem to be for consideration whether/the efficacy of the campaign might not be increased, andsome of the criticism in neutral countries diminished, ifit were decided that any further leaflets should be\^   confined to factual information rather than argument.(Intd.)
