^ 9^ uWAR CABINET.Copy No.The,wearing of uniform &apos;by members of UnitedKingdom Forces when visiting Eire on leave.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of Statefor Domini on Affgirs.One of the matters raised by Mr.  de valera with sir John Maffey during the latter&apos;s visit to Dublin before taking up appointment as United Kingdom Representative, wasthe question of the wearing of uniform by members of theUnited Kingdom forces when on leave in Eire.2.      Mr.   de valera said that he was well aware that large numbers of Eire citizens had enlisted and wereenlisting in United Kingdom forces.      He had done nothing and wished to do nothing to interfere with this, but herepresented that it might be difficult for him to maintain this attitude if political capital were made by his extremistopponents out of the presence in Sire of a large number ofpersons in British uniform.      Moreover, there was always a risk that the extremists might seek to promote incidents byorganising attacks on such persons, which, apart from thedanger to the individuals concerned, would have embarrassing-political repercussions.3.      Mr.  de valera, therefore, asked very earnestly that&quot;the authorities here should issue general instructions that allPersonnel of United Kingdom forces proceeding to Eire on leave

leave should wear plain clothes.4.      Mr.  de Valera subsequently recurred - to the matter in the first conversation which he had with Sir John Maffeyafter the latter&apos;s arrival in Dublin as United kingdom representative, and again stressed its importance-5.      The position has been considered by the service departments, who have pointed out the serious administrative difficulties which would arise,  particularly in the case ofthe Army where about 15,000 men are involved.      I understand,however,  that it is practicable to devise arrangements which,at some expense, would, enable effect to be given to generalinstructions of this character without depriving the personnel concerned of the opportunity of going to Eire on leave.6.      In view of the importance of preserving Eire as a source for recruits, and of ensuring that no incidents suchas that feared by Mr.   de Valera should arise,  I would ask forthe authority of the v/ar Cabinet in order that I may inform mr.  de&quot;&apos;VCLsra that we are prepared to meet his request in thismatter and that the necessary arrangements will be made toensure that members of United Kingdom forces, proceeding on leave to Eire, will wear plain clothes.A.   E.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.17th October, 1939.- S -
