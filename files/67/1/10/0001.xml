IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )COPY NO.   J Ir. R E T.p. (ft) (59) 10.^v- WAR CAB MET.DOMIfflOIT pOLLABOJE^IOff.Report &quot;by Ministerial Committee.The War Cabinet, at their meeting on Thursday,14th September, appointed a Committee with the followingcomposition:-Minister without Portfolio    (in the Chair)Minister for Co-ordination of defence secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.The terms of reference of the Committee were as follows:-&quot;To consider the existing system of collaboration with the Dominions;    how far it meets theneeds of the present situation;    and tomake suggestions for any improvementsthat are considered desirable&quot;.EXISTING MACHINERY.2.      (a) Ministerial and Political Liaison.An arrangement has been made, whereby the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs has special access to theWar Cabinet in order that he may be in the best positionto maintain contact between the War Cabinet and theDominions.       The normal work of the Dominions secretary and the Dominions Office in acting as the channel of communicatior   with Dominion Governments in all mattersof policy has thus already been adapted to some extentto meet the needs of the war situation..In order to keep the Dominion Governments fully informed of the current position, a special telegram isprepared every morning for despatch to them (exceptEire),        Its contents are based on the Daily Situation-1-

Report which is placed before the Chiefs of Staff at 10 a.m,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs meets the high commissioners for Canada, Australia, New Zealand and SouthAfrica every afternoon, shows them the telegram, and givesthem any further information which he considers desirable in the light of the morning War Cabinet meeting.(D) Departmental LiaisonoEach of the Dominion High Commissioners has aPolitical Secretary, who maintains contact with the ForeignOffice.      There is also a system of Dominion ServiceLiaison Officers, some of whom are in the Offices ofDominion High Commissioners in the United Kingdom, and someof whom are attached to the Service Ministries, and whose duty is to maintain contact particularly on thesupply side.      The extent to which Dominions are represented in this way varies considerablyo      Details,are give in Appendix A.There is a certain amount of contact maintained between the Officers of the Dominion High commissioners in the United Kingdom and some of the Civil Departmentssuch as the Food (Defence Plans) Department, theExport Credits Guarantee Department,  and the Board of Trade,etc.      Further details are given in Appendix BP(c) Liaison with the Cabinet Offices.The Political Secretaries to the High Commissionersfor Australia and New Zealand also act as liaison officers with the Cabinet Offices.      This arrangement has been inforce for a number of years, and in peace-time it served to keep the Governments of those Dominions informed of matters dealt with by the Committee of Imperialla

jtefenea^-which particularly affected them.      These liaison officers continue their work in the War Cabinet Office.3,        The machinery for liaison described above has been built up over a period of years and sufficed for peace time requirements*     We do not think that it is sufficientlycomprehensive to meet the needs of a war in which some atany rate of the Dominions will be exerting themselves to theutmost in the common cause.      We therefore suggest certain measures for strengthening and improving the system as abasis for discussion with the Dominions themselves through such channels as the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsmay deem appropriate.DOMINION COLLABORATION IN THE LAST WAR - IMPERIAL WARCABINET.h. It will be recalled that,  early in 19175 after thelast war had been in progress^for^a-considerable time,the need for the closer collaboration of the Dominions in-theconduct of the war was recognised by the setting up of an imperial War Cabinet.      An historical note on the subject is attached at Appendix C.5. There are obvious difficulties in the way of an earlyresort to a similar organisation.      It is unlikely that thePrime Ministers of any of the Dominions would be in a positionto make the journey to the United Kingdom at the present timewhen they are faced with such pressing problems in theirrespective countries.      The probability that this country maybe subjected to a heavy scale  of ail:-? attack, and the heavy pressure on the War Cabinet, are also reasons for caution in suggesting a gathering of Empire Prime Ministers at an earlynd-date.     We have therefore put aside from our immediaterecommendations the idea of an Imperial War Cabinet, though we consider that the possibility of any such meeting of prime Ministers (nrob^bly under a different title) should bekept in mind as a possible later development.

pato hila colleamies on the *:?ast effort that we ourselves are makingj..4..,PROPOSALS FOR COLLABORATION ON THE HIGHEST PLANE.(a) information the existing arrangements for keeping High commissioners and their Governments informed of the situation, as described above (paragraph 1 (a)) are satisfactory, and should continue.In addition, however, we think that High Commissioners shouldhave further opportunities of discussing important matters with members of the War Cabinet, and, conversely, that ministers should have opportunities for consultation with the high commissioners.      One such meeting has already been held andEnd we recommend that the Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsBfo7 should be authorised to convene further periodical meetings atwhich the High Commissioners would meet members of the WarCabinet.      The occasion for such meetings would be left to the discretion of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs butwe do not consider that normally they need take place more frequently than once a fortnight.(b) Consultation7.        We do not think, however, that the above arrangements will suffice to ensure that intimate consultation between thevarious Governments of the Empire, v/hich is essential to theproper co-ordination of their war effort, but which cannot besecured either through High Commissioners, or by exchange of telegrams.    It is probable that owing to the difficulty ofjudging events at so great a distance, the Governments and peoples of some of the Dominions have not been able fully torealise the nature of the struggle on which we have embarked,the magnitude of our own effort, and the vital need for themto exert their full war effort if the outcome is to be successful.     We think that a more real appreciation of theProblems confronting the Empire would be obtained if a minister of State from each of the Dominions could be sparedto visit this country at once.      The essence of any such arrangement would be that a Minister in the full confidence of-is Government would be able to see for himself and report personally

nsndation..Iand would be in a position to convey to his own government a clear picture of the best means which theycould employ to assist.8. The above suggestion is clearly one whichintimately affects the position of the Dominion high commissioners in London.      We recommend therefore thatthe Seoretary of State for Dominion Affairs should-beauthorised to take soundings,  either through theDominion High Commissioners or otherwise, with a view to ascertaining the reactions of the various DominionGovernments to the proposalo9. We feel that the time has not yet come when   -the possible participation of the Dominions in theSupreme War Council can usefully be considered.PROPOSALS FOR COLLABORATION OH THE DEPARTMENTAL PLANE.10.        Liaison with the Dominions in naval matters issatisfactoryat present v and does .not - appear to needany special steps&amp;       We are not satisfied,however,, that in the case of the Army and Air force the existing system of Liaison Officers is adequate forthe needs of war,,      There appear to be three urgent rquirements which should be fulfilled if the war effort of the Dominions is to be co-ordinated with ourownt-(a) There should be close collaboration as tothe-scope of the&quot;military and air con-tribution which each Dominion is to make to the common cause.      The nature of this contribution is, of course, ultimately forthe respective Governments to decide, butwe think that their decision would bemuch facilitated by the presence in this

country of military and air officers of equivalent standing to the Deputy Chiefsof Staff.      The need for such collahorationcan best be explained by means of an example.      In a recent telegram (No.  147dated 12th September, 1939) the Governmentof New Zealand have stated that a fullytrained division could leave the Dominionfor service in Prance or any theatre ofwar which at the time might be indicatedas more appropriate within a period of eight months from today.      They raised thealternative whether it would be more advantageous to transport this divisionat any early date to some place where itstraining might continue in favourable circumstances.      This alternative isy-   bound up with the provision oftraining equipment.      It does not fallC.      within our terms of reference to providej    answers to such questions, but we thinkit is clear that the presence of Dominion   .military representatives of high standingwould facilitate the task of reaching rapidV    decisions on such important matters.(b) An inroroved channel of communication should beset up between the War Office and Air ministry in this country, and their counterparts inthe Dominions.      This channel would beprovided by reinforcing the present liaison officers.      Its object would be tofacilitate the carrying out by the Chiefsof Staff and their Dominion collaborators,of whatever joint policy may be decided upon.      The expansion of Dominion forces would require the provision of much warmaterial.      The expanded body of liaison officers would be in a position to studydevelopments of training and equipment inthis country, to advise their departments in the Dominions and to watch over theordering, production and despatch of equipment manufactured in this country forthe Dominion Forces.(c) A system of liaison officers with the civil departments in this country to insurecollaboration in the field of supply ofmunitions,  food, raw materials, etc.We recommend that the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs should examine this aspect of the matter further with theDominions High Commissioners^

11o       The above requirements can best be fulfilledby the eventual establishment in this country of whatwould in effect be Dominion missions, including bothcivil and military elements.      This arrangements would ensure permanent contact with the Dominions over thewhole field of defensive preparations, in the same way as with our French Allies.Irthiommendation.12.       We suggest that it might prove the easiest course to establish these arrangements gradually, so as to keep pace with the development of - the Dominions effort andthe growth of their forces;    but we recommend that a start should be made towards (a) and (b) in paragraph 10by suggesting that the Dominion Ministers who are invitedto visit this country for consultation should be accom-panied. by a nucleus staff of military and air officers.The.se could remain behind after the departure of theirMini-ministers, and continue, day to day collaboration.ARRANGEMENTS FOR LIAISON IN THE DOMINIONS.13.        The question arises whether we should notreciprocate by offering to establish correspondingmissions in the Dominions.      We think it is too earlyin the war to make any general recommendations on thispoint.      Certain missions already exist,  or are con-templated, and we think that the question can be left,for consideration from time to time in accordance withcircumstances.(Signed) &quot;HANKEY.on behalf of the Committee.ond Tertece, S.W.I.,l4th September, 1939.

APPENDIX C.The System of Control of Imperial Policyduring the Great War.During the course of the Great War of 1914-1918 theDominions and Colonies devoted their man-power and economic resources to an increasing extent to the prosecution of thewar, and it was therefore felt to he necessary, not only tokeep the Overseas Governments fully informed of the course ofevents, but that these Governments should as far as was practicable, participate in the Seliberations which determined the main outlines of Imperial policy.Accordingly, in December 1916, the Prime Minister ofeach of the self-governing Dominions was invited to attend a series of special meetings of the War Cabinet for thediscussion of questions affecting the prosecution of the War;the Viceroy of India was also asked to send representatives fora similar purpose.    These invitations were accepted by all the self-governing Dominions and India, and the delegations werecomposed of the Prime Minister wherever possible? and certain technical experts.When the Conference assembled, for the sake of convenience it was divided into two parts.    On the one sidewere meetings of what came to be known as the Imperial WarCabinet.   This consisted of the Oversea Representatives andthe members of the British War   Cabinet sitting together asan Imperial War Cabinet for deliberation on the conduct ofthe war and for the discussion of the larger issues ofImperial policy connected with the war.     On the other sidewas the Imperial War conference presided over by theSecretary of State for the Colonies which consisted of the oversea Representatives and a number of other Ministers, and discussed questions of lesser importance connected with thewar or non-war problems, and was,  in effect, an ImperialConference on the lines of the pre-war Conferences.The Imperial War Cabinet held its first session during-10-

the early part of 1917, and the satisfactory results attainedwere announced by the Prime Minister in a   speech to theHouse of Commons in May 1917, and by Sir Ra Borden in June1918.The next series of Imperial War Cabinet and imperial war Conference meetings commenced on the llth June, 1918,and coincided with one of the most critical phases   ofmilitary operations in the Western Theatre.    During this session certain improvements we re introduced into the actualmachinery of the Imperial War Cabinet, so that there mightbe continuity in the proceedings, notwithstanding the factthat the Prime Ministers of the Dominions could not remainconstantly in London0    The change was introduced as a resultof the following Resolution, which was accepted by theImperial War Cabinet on the 30th July, 1918;I    (l)    The Prime Ministers of the Dominions, as members of the Imperial War Cabinet, havethe right of direct communication with thePrime Minister of the United Kingdom, and vice versa.(2)    Such communications should be confined to questions of Cabinet importance.    ThePrime Ministers themselves are the judges of such questions.(3)    Telegraphic communications between thePrime Ministers should, as a rule, be conducted through the Colonial Officemachinery, but this will not exclude theadoption of more direct means of communica-tion in exceptional circumstances.II    In order to secure continuity in the work of theImperial War Cabinet and a permanent means of consultation during the war on the more important questions of common interest, the Prime Ministerof each Dominions has the right to nominatea Cabinet Minister either as a resident orvisitor in London, to represent him at meetingsof the Imperial War Cabinet to be held regularlybetween the plenary sessions.It was decided that arrangements shouldbe made for the representation of India atthose Meetings..

Before the changes contemplated in the latter halfof the above Resolution could take effect, the rapidcollapse of the Central Powers precipitated the wholequestion of the discussion of peace terms, and theDominion Prime Ministers were invited to take part in thediscussions with the Allies of the peace settlementitself.The third Session of the Imperial War Cabinetmet on the 20th November, 1918, and commenced theconsideration of the many questions relating to thePeace Settlement.
