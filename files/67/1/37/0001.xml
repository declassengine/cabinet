Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1939.SECRET.Gopy/NoW.P. (G-) (39) 37.WAR CABINET.THE URGENCY OF CHARTERING NEUTRAL TONNAGE.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.IN accordance with the Cabinet decision recorded in War cabinet meeting 38 (39), paragraph 9, I have held various meetings and conferenceshere with representatives of departments concerned, upon the chartering andcontrol of neutral tonnage. This appears the more necessary in view of the grave rationing proposals now under discussion, and may become more urgentif shipping is lost through intensified Air attack. The War has been in progress for forty days, and so far we have not obtained any neutral tonnage worthmentioning. This is not due to any lack of willingness in the Board of Trade,but in part to the directions given to the President by the Cabinet to dealsomewhat stiffly with the Norwegian representatives in respect of tanker tonnage,and to avoid being what is called &quot; blackmailed.&quot;2. However, the situation is such that we should hardly be wise to delaymuch longer in making the best bargain we can. Shipping rates in the late war were long maintained above 40s. and at one time reached 58s. a ton. TheBoard of Trade have expressed the opinion that large quantities of tonnage couldbe chartered if we were ready to pay as much as to 20s. a ton, and quite recentlySwitzerland has chartered 15 Greek ships at 15s. a ton. a fair rate in war timebeing about 12s. a ton. If we take the present rate at 15s. a ton, with certaincomplications in respect of risks and time-charter, it is evident that the extentof the &quot; blackmail &quot; might run to about 5s. a ton. On three million tons, if wecould get them, this would be three quarters of a million a month. Although thischarge is vexing, it would be false economy to allow the expense if it cannotbe avoided to stand in the way of urgent -and indispensable service, havingregard to the proportion of events and the grievous evils of needlessly severerationing, shortage of supplies, or lack of essential shipping. Provided lengthycharters can be arranged, this is not an excessive insurance premium againstthe rates rising to 40s. or 50s. We may be able to do better, but do not let us do worse.  Better this than delay.3. On the present decisions the Board of Trade broke with the Norwegiansupon the tankers, and the Norwegians went home. The firmness shown is now reported to have had a salutary effect, and a Mr. Fearnley is to be here on the21st October with plenary powers. We must, of course, wait till then; but itseems of extreme importance to close with them, even above what we have offeredso far.4. The Greek shipping interest have been offered 12s. Qd. per ton, plus theinsurance, &amp;c, for a large amount of tonnage; they have been told that, if theydo not accept this by Tuesday, the 17th October, we shall deny them bunkerageand all shipping facilities so far as we can. Having regard to the fact thatneutrals are disinclined to proceed to sea, and seem quite sure rates are rising,it may well be that our threat to cut their coal will prove ineffective. It seemsdifficult to believe that when the Swiss have closed with them at 15s. a ton theywill not hold out for several weeks.  It would, therefore, be wise to let our threat[20136]
run only till the time-limit expires, and then offer (say) a shilling better thanthe Swiss terms, coupled with the full threat in the event of recalcitrancyAnyhow close.5. The Danish position is more complicated. By their agreement orNon-Aggression Pact with Germany made last summer they are entitled to carryon &quot; normal &quot; trade, both with Britain and Germany in time of war. Up tillten days ago the Germans have respected this agreement, but now they have be^undetaining Danish ships. Germany may continue to respect the agreement, inwhich case it would be in our interests to allow it to continue, even thoughGermany gets some butter and bacon, and a certain leak in the blockade isopened. We want our butter and bacon. We do not want to have unduerationing this winter.6. It must be remembered that the new fact about Danish and Baltic trade as compared with the last war, is the Air-power of Germany over these waters.The Royal Navy can go there to fight, but not to trade. In the last war the danes were persuaded to creep around the 3-mile limit by the Kattegat andthe Skaggerrack up the Norwegian coast to Bergen, whence we organised convoy.We ought to try to make them do this. If they do, and are attacked insideterritorial waters, the case is provided for general reprisals on German exports in neutral bottoms moving between neutral ports, and, of course, for blockingby an effective mine-field, if necessary, the southward movement of ore duringthe winter down the Norwegian coast from Narvik. If they don&apos;t attack the danish ships within the 3-mile limit, or if they allow the Non-Aggression Pactto operate and normal trade to be carried on, we get our butter and bacon.Apparently the definition of the word &quot; normal &quot; is at present the hitch.But such a point should not be allowed to prevent the implementing of theGerman-Danish agreement. We must try to establish other definitions of&quot;normal&quot; for other neutrals, should we be compelled to accept an awkwarddefinition in this case. We are entitled to deal with each example according to circumstances.In all the above it would be worth our while to pay what looks like anexorbitant price for a longer contract, as there is serious risk, if the war goes on.that all freights are going to rise, and the neutrals know this.7. We must, however, expect that the Germans will put terrifying pressure on the Danes to serve only German interests, and it may be that all Danish tradewith Great Britain will be stopped. In this case our retaliation is deadly. Westop all imports of feeding-stuffs into Denmark and the Baltic, thus starving the lot together. We could divert these feeding-stuffs to England and increase ourpig-population very rapidly. It is true that one ton of bacon requires six tonsof food-stuffs to import, but, if we take up enough neutral shipping, we can bring this in from ocean sources. This large change in our feeding arrangements may&quot;&quot; be found far less onerous than the severe rationing which may be thealternative.8. The advantage of obtaining control of the bulk of neutral tonnage, towhich we can also offer the security of convoy, means that we can control Germanimports and exports with the minimum of search and friction. This would be equally convenient both in its Naval and Diplomatic aspect.9. To sum up, by the end of this week we should allow existing tentativebargainings to lapse unless agreements are reached; and thereafter use both thebait of any price under twenty shillings, combined with the maximum threat ofall our retaliatorv measures, to force prompt agreement.W. S. C.Admiralty, October 16, 1939.
