HSTG)-(39) 23Copy No a s,. -^ofe o 6 os document is the property of his Britannic Majesj^y^sGovernment 0W A R    0 A B I N E TArrangements for distribution of news and CensorshipMemorandum by Minister of information the     Prime Minister-s statement in the House to-nightdefined precisely the limitations of the responsibility of theMinistry of Information for News and foreshadowed a review of thearrangements for the distribution of the News.The question that arises is what arc to bo therelations between the Departments (which are individually responsiblefor the preparation and issue of News and for answering criticisms);and the mechanism for issue which at present exists at the Ministry ofInformation.     This mechanism, I ought to explain, is on a scale withwhich nothing in existence at any of the individual Ministries iscomparable     Two large halls have been nn de available for Pressmen,a large number of telephone boxes have boon sot up for thorn and I am quite certain that the facilities available are of great value to thePress and that to substitute inferior arrangements would be resented,I think it is quits clear that none of the Whitehall offices hasspace available to set up anything on the same scale, that if they didit would..take considerable time to set it up, and that the cost of setting it up, even in the more important offices, would &quot;be very great,My conclusion is that in the general interest the Pressfacilities at the Ministry of Information should continue to bemaintained as a distributing centre, as a &quot;Press Bureau&quot;, so to speak,fc*        Departments generally.      Each Department would be free to use this &quot;Press Bureau&quot;, as it has been used in the past, but it would rest with the Minister of the particular Department to say how far the normal Press contacts at the Press Bureau should be supplementedDy special contacts at the Department itself 0

But, I feel quite certain that if the Press Bureau, as described above, remains part of the Ministry   of Information, even for the limited purposes that are in view,  the Ministry of Information will never &quot;be able to shake the public in their belief that theresponsibility for the amount and character of the news issued stillrests with the Ministry of Information.    I am unwilling to accept anynlan which does not secure this.    What I urge, therefore,  is that theorganisation for the distribution of News to the Press now at theMinistry should be described as a Government &quot;Press Bureau&quot;,  andshould be withdrawn entirely from the range of responsibilities of theliinister of Information.Under this plan the responsibility for answering complaints aboutthe character of the news issued by a particular department, whether in Parliament or elsewhere, would rest upon the Minister of that department.    There would remain the responsibility for the actualworking of the organisation of the Press Bureau itself   I will not suggest what would be a suitable Ministry to place it under; but Ithink it essential that it should be removed from my   responsibility,because its removal seems to me to be essential if the Public is torealise that news is no longer a matter for the Ministry ofInformation,This proposal raises, however, the question of the press censorship,    The criticisms of the Ministry in relation to press censorship arise from substantially the same causes as are at the bottom of the criticism of the News side of the Ministry.    We have notsot, and are not likely to have,  information full enough or promptenough to make the censorship satisfactory to the Press.    It is accepted that the Ministry have nothing to do with the provision ofand it follows that they cannot bo responsible for adequateCOii2orship.    That, too, must be the responsibility of  the Departmentsn whose interest the censorship is used0    There is much to be said4 - the continuance of centralised Press censorship, like the cne at

hnistr;try of. Information and placed under another Minister,M,September 28th,1939--oresent in force, guided by representatives of the individualMinistries deputed to work with the Censorj But, unless thecontact with separate departments, and in particular, with theService Departments is fuller and prompter than it is at present,the Press will still be given occasions for complaint of the kind that have occurred recently,,   The alternative is that &quot;ServiceOffices&quot;, Foreign Offices,  and the A.RaP.  should have separatecensorships, each under its own office.    The difficulties of co-ordination are obvious and it would be inconvenient to the Press,which, I feel confident, would greatly prefer  to have a centralcensorship in the same building as the central Press Bureau,Whatever view is taken on these points, I feel strongly thatthe Ministry of Information should be relieved of the responsibilityfor Censorship at the same time as it  is relieved of responsibilityfor the News,    It would have to be settled where the responsibilityfor Censorship would be placed, a responsibility much moreimportant than the responsibility for the mechanism of the PressBureau,  to which I have referred above e    All -1 would say is that control of Censorship is a question of defence policy, for it isintimately related to Defence plans and operations,My proposals are;-I&apos;        The Information Officers of the various Departments atpresent employed at the Ministry of Information should return totheir Departments and function there as in peace time,2*        There should be set up a Press Bureau,  as in the last war,consisting of two Departments:(a) A department for the receipt  of news and press messagesfrom the various Departments for distribution;(:P.) A central censorship of press material.The Press Bureau should be entirely dissociated from the
