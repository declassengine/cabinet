j^nmn^^lS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT,\ /   COPY NO.     ; jj(G)(39)14.WAR     CABINET,RESTRICTION OF IMPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.1,  I feel it necessary to bring before the War Cabinet animportant and difficult question about the restriction ofimports from the United States and Canada, for the purpose of enabling us to concentrate all available resources in dollarexchange on the purchase of commodities which are essential for the prosecution of the war,2. The War Cabinet is already aware of the grave weakness of our gold and foreign exchange position, and recentlyissued instructions calling for the maximum possiblerestriction of unnecessary imports involving payments in the difficult currencies.      The unavoidable demands on suchcurrencies by the purchasing Departments are already verylarge indeed, and as nev/ decisions are taken to increase the size of the fighting forces these demands seem likely to grow to dimensions which it will be very difficulty indeed,if not actually impossible,  to meet in full.      The two most difficult of the difficult currencies are the United Statesand the Canadian dollar.3. We have already prohibited, except under licence, theimport of a long list of luxury goods and of goods of whichthere are sufficient home supplies,  in order to conserve ourexchange resources generally.      In 1937 the value of theimports of these goods was about  74 m.  find it is estimatedthat the imports will be reduced to about  11,000,000(i.e. a reduction of  63,000,000).    The reduction in importsfrom the United States under this heading amounts to about 8,000,000 (motor-cars, typewriters, office machinery, etc.)

and from Canada to about  5,250,000.4. I have now been asked to consider what further reductioncan be effected in normal imports from these countries, eventhough the result may be to leave us short of things to whichall classes of the population are accustomed.      I find that theonly way in which we can make substantial additional quantitiesof dollar exchange available is by ceasing to buy,  or very muchrestricting our purchases from these countries of fruit (freshapples and pears, and tinned fruit), tobacco and films.      Thefollowing table shows our imports of these goods from the UnitedStates raid Canada in the year 1937,  the figure for cinematograph films being the estimated annual payment made for the rights of american films.United Kingdom Imports in 1937,	Prom United States.	Prom Canada.Fruit (apples and pears (fresh) and tinned) Cinematograph films ...	 m. c; o 14.2 6,5	 m. 2,1 0.6	26.6                1          2.7	5. The maximum saving of dollar exchange which might be madedoes not, of course, amount to the full figure of  29.3   m.shown in the table.      As regards tobacco the big companies have in band some two years stocks and have already purchased about a quarter of this year&apos;s crop.      There is,  therefore, no need forfurther substantial purchases at the present time (apart perhapsfrom evening things out by some small purchases from Canada).As regards fruit, we have this year a large apple crop and thereis not, therefore, the same need for imports as in 1937 and 1938.though it may be desirable to allow a small quantity in order tomaintain trade contacts.    It is very desirable from our ownpoint of view to maintain some imports of tinned fruits from america;    the amount which must so be imported is at present

iOiunder investigation.     As regards cinematograph films, it wouldhe impracticable to stop royalties going back to America byimport control because there are already large numbers of american films in this country.      I should,  therefore,  contemplatecorning to some arrangement with the American film interests bywhich the sums accruing to them from royalties would be reducedas much as possible.      I should also perhaps mention anotherfact which is likely to prejudice a trade of major importance tothe United States, namely that purchases of dried fruits are controlled by Government and our normal takings from the UnitedStates may have to be much reduced.6, But before the War Cabinet reach a decision on the questionof such drastic action,  I feel I must put before them the great difficulties which would fall on the United States Government andthe possible consequences.      The fruit and tobacco growers willhe very hard hit, and many of them will be faced with ruin unlessthe United States Government steps in to save them.      As I know from bitter experience during the passage of the Films Act and during the negotiations which resulted in the Trade Agreementlast year, each of these trades is of the utmost importancepolitically to the United States Government, particularlytobacco, the bulk of which is produced in the traditionallydemocrat Southern States;    we should be forced by lack of dollarexchange to abstain from buying, but from the point of view ofthe American producer the position would be the same as if we had ceased to observe our side of the Agreement.      Our action ishound to lead to strong pressure on the United States Governmentto abrogate the Agreement.      In view of the welcome which theTrade Agreement received in almost every quarter,  I need notstress the political effects of its abrogation, but there isalso a more tangible aspect.      I reckon that the agreement has enabled us to increase our exports to the United States byQetween  5m.  and  10m.  a year.      With the depreciation of^trling and boom conditions developing in America (our trade is mainly in luxury goods) that increase is likely to grow rapidly.

Tlie termination of the Agreement would not only resultin a reversion to the American import duties existingbefore the Agreement came into force hut in addition,owing to the depreciation of sterling, the United StatesGovernment would he pressed to increase the duties above their former level.      If this happened the re stilts would be greatly todecrease our exports to the United States which, for exchangereasons, we desire to increase.7. If, nevertheless,  the War Cabinet consider that the vitalneeds for conserving our immediate dollar resources outweigh   the dangers I have just referred to, I would still urge that intelling the Americans of our intentions we should be prepared togive certain assurances if that course v/ould save the trade agreement.      In the first place we should make it clear that our   &apos;action is dictated by necessity.      But I think it is equally important that we should be ready to assure the Americans that,the reduction of imports from the United States which is forced upon us by the War will not be used as a cloak for permanentlyaltering the channels of trade.      On the contrary, we intend inpresent circumstances to limit our total consumption of these commodities.      It is also our intention as soon as may bepossible to return to our peace-time commercial policy and follow the most-favoured-nation principles on which the Trade agreement is based, facing the difficulties which this readjustment will involve.      Oriental tobacco is a special case on which certainassurances have already been given to the United StatesGovernment.8. So far as Canada is concerned the difficulties areintrinsically less both because the amount of trade affected is^mailer and because Canada will reap greater advantages from ourmunitions programme.      But in the case of apples, the canadian government will be faced with serious political difficulties,particularly in Nova Scotia from which province the bulk of theeroP is exported to this country.      I feel therefore that wes ould give them also advance notice of what we may be proposing to do.

9. To sum up, directions are required on the following points(a) that no further substantial purchases of United states or Canadian leaf tobacco should be permitted until further notice, apart from the possibility of some small purchases in Canada should it be apparent    that their tobacco growersare being more harshly dealt with than the United Statestobacco growers:(b) that our purchases of apples, pears and canned fruitsfrom the United States and Canada should be restricted toour own minimum requirements, with possibly a slightly lessdrastic restriction on Canadian than on United States apples:(c) that I should be authorised in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer to make the best bargain I canwith the American film interests for reducing the sumsaccruing to them for- royalties etc. : and(d) that the whole position should be explained fully to the United States and Canadian Governments at theearliest possible opportunity.O.P.G.S.Trade;September, 1939,
