THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OPHIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.WP (G) (40) 193.22 July 1940.WAR CABINET.BRITISH TRANSATLANTIC AIR SERVICE.MEMORANDUM BY THE POSTMASTER GENERAL.The re-establishment of a British Transatlantic Air service would have considerable value from the point of view of Britishprestige, particularly in America, as already evidenced by theprominence given to the subject in the Press,There would be considerable advantages from the carriage of mails by suoh a servioe.I,     The present Transatlantic Air Mail Service is provided byPan-Amerioan Clipper flying boats between New York and Lisbon anda British service provides a connecting link between Lisbon andthe United Kingdom twice a week.     At the best the time oftransmission from London to New York is 2 daysj   but the connectionat Lisbon is uncertain as the Clipper frequently leaves one or two days behind schedule, and mails are, moreover, liable to be left behind there through lack of capacity on the Clipper Service.During the past two months the average time of transmission of airmails from London to New York has been 5 days:   by the british service transmission to New York within      days would normally be assured.     The saving in time would be particularly valuable for urgent official mail.     It should be borne in mind that inreckoning times of travel to the United States we have the apparentadvantage of East to West transit.2.    Payment is due to he made in gold franos to the United states for United Kingdom Mails by the Clipper Servioe at the rate ofabout
about  240,000. a year.     Only a portion of the 1,800 lb. ofmail at present sent each week by the Clipper Service could betransferred to the British service, but so far as the mails were so transferred out payments to the United States would be savedand the purchase of dollar exchange would be avoided.3.     The proposed British service would be of special benefitto Canada and Newfoundland, which would be served en route,whereas correspondence for these countries sent by the ClipperService has to be sent via New York and forwarded thence by airor surface transport.(initialled)    W.S.M.GENERAL POST OFFICE22 July, 1940.
