I understand that the purely military details have already been sent to the War Office. The following points ofgeneral interest may be noted : Since the 20th May the Germans have begun to move troops, guns, andmaterial to the West.By the 26th May the German garrisons in Southern Bohemia had beenreduced to 20 per cent, of their normal strength; the Prague garrison to only10 per cent, of its normal. There have been similar reductions in other parts ofthe Protectorate. The depletions are being made good by the calling-up of freshbatches of recruits.On instructions from Berlin the Skoda works have cancelled their orders for turkey, Yugoslavia, Greece and Roumania.There is great activity on the railways. Everything is being moved to theWest; rolling-stock, anti-aircraft guns, Red Cross trains, petrol, tanks, &amp;c. Onemessage says : &quot; The whole German people is being mobilised.&quot; Recruits arebeing sent West after only one week&apos;s training. They have, however, alreadyundergone several months&apos; semi-military training in the Arbeitsdienst.The aeroplane factories, in addition to their present orders, are working day and night on repairs of aeroplanes damaged in the West. The large Ringhofferworks are specialising in the repair of tanks. Heavy aeroplane bombs, weighing1,800 kilog., are being manufactured at Vitkovice.   Several hundred are-ready.Some trains with German wounded have arrived. There have been heavy losses among the Sudeten Germans, who are dissatisfied with their treatment.11066   [21409]
Wounded soldiers back from the Western front say that Germany cannot hold out for more than two months, and that the Allies should bomb communications more often.The Nazi authorities, however, express complete confidence. German officialshave received orders to be ready to leave for Switzerland. -iThe home Czechs believe that Germany&apos;s desperate haste to finish the war intwo months is dictated (i) by fear of the intervention of the United States; and(ii) by anxiety regarding the coming winter, which will be grim. According toCzech estimates 50 to 80 per cent, of the rye and 12 to 20 per cent, of the wheathave been destroyed by last winter&apos;s frosts. There is a catastrophic dearth offodder.R. H.
