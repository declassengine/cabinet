(ggS^DOCTMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)pj^O R E T COPY NO.  11 _inr.P.fl.   (40)165. . WAR   CABINET.USE OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE ARMY.Note by the President of the Board of Education onthe Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.1.     The latest information that I can give as to boardingplaces in Boys&apos; Public Schools, i.e. the 183 Schools represented on the Headmasters&apos; Conference is as follows?-(a) Boarding Schools (i.e. schools at which atleast half the boys are boarders or wherethere are more than 200 boarders) 22,000&apos; (b.) Other Public Schools 2,700Total 24,7002.    -Several of the schools concerned have already moved from vulnerable areas to safer districts and their premiseshave been taken over for national purposes.      This reduces thenumber of schools-available for the expansion of the Army, whileit also means that several schools are already carrying on in circumstances of great difficulty as the result of the war.At the same time, the Minister of Health is understood to be considering the question of requisitioning certain schoolsentirely&quot;for hospital purposes and has earmarked others asshadow hospitals to be used if the existing hospital supply should prove insufficient.      No information is available as towhat further inroads this would&apos;make on the school accommodation.3.      The general position, therefore, is that -(a)-. If all the available Boys Public Schools were taken overthe boarding accommodation would.be substantially short of the figure of 35,000 quoted in the Secretary ofState&apos;s Memorandum;
(b)  the Boys Public Schools have already suffered as theresult of the war, and they are likely to be asked tomake a further substantial contribution to the war effort, in providing hospital aecornraodation.4.      The connection of my Department with these schoolsis in general less close than with those schools which are partof the state system of education, but I recognise the important contribution which they make to education in this country.The training given in them has a value which is recognisedthroughout the world and which is certainly not lessened intime of war.      To  close Public Schools for a substantialperiod would be to deprive man2?&apos; boys of the benefits of this type of education at the most critical period of their lives,and in addition to jeopardise their future prospects afterthe war.5.      It may be argued, that since the closure is to be only temporary the ill effects can be repaired.      This overlooksthe consequences of closure even for a period of a few months.On the Secretary of State*s figures, ,75 ,000 boys would bedispersed to make room for 50,000 soldiers.      It would not bepossible to provide for more than a very small proportion ofthis number of boys in grant aided Second.ar3r Schools, and even for that small proportion the break in the continuity of theireducation would be most damaging.      I cannot contemplate withoutthe gravest misgivings a situation in which at least some 60,000boys are debarred from all education for an indefinite period.Moreover, the teaching staffs would lose their occupation andlie.driven to seek other employment, and the whole organisation11of the schools would, be suspended.      Even flourishing schoolswould, find it diifficult to survive this shock without impairment,and when it is remembered that many schools were before the waralready suffering from economic and other d.difficulties theeffects on the whole system would be disastrous.L. 2.
6.      The special characteristics of the public Schoolsmay lead to their being regarded as a class apart, but infact they are a part, and only a part, of an educational system which includes Girls&apos;  Public and private Schools,preparatory Schools, Training Colleges and Day secondary schools.      It is a mistake to think that these other classesof Schools are necessarily unsuitable by size and amenitiesfor the present purpose.     Many of them are in every way just as satisfactory as the Boys&apos; Public Schools, while otherscould be adapted without any great difficulty.      This is recognised in the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum by theinclusion of classrooms as affording residential accommodation.If further sacrifices are to be made by Schools,  they shouldbe made by all kinds of Schools and Institutions;    otherwise the result will be irreparable damage to one section of our national education, with widespread and justifiable publicresentment.     Moreover, it cannot fail to be suspected thatthe requisitioning of the public Schools alone, as proposedby the Secretary of State,  is part of a covert attempt tosecure their ultimate elimination.7.     But, while I suggest that any sacrifice that schoolsmay be called upon to bear should be shared equitably, i submit that there are other sources which could and shouldbe tapped before heavy demands are made upon the Schools.Up and down the Country there are scores of large hotels,many with spacious grounds, which are still functioningnormally, and in many places there are halls, amusement centres and public institutions, often of considerable size, withopen spaces and recreation grounds conveniently near fortraining purposes.     I suggest that these sources of supply should be surveyed before any comprehensive requisitioning of schools is decided upon.
pWCLUS^GjrS8,    I submit, therefore, that in considering the questionof what premises should be taken for the purposes which theSecretary of State has in mind, the&apos;Government should beactuated by two principles%-(a) that the burden should be spread as widely as possible,and not confined to a single interest, viz.. Education;(b) that in so far as it is found necessary to call uponEducation to bear part of the burden, it should bespread over various types of educational institutions and not confined to- one type only, viz. the Boys&apos;Public Boarding Schools.If these principles are accepted, and if in theresult part of the burden has to fall, on Education, I do not doubt that, on an estimate being given of the amount and location of the residential facilities required, educationalinterests would be ready to make their contribution to theSecretary of State&apos;s proposal in a manner that would not be seriously detrimental to the educational system of the country.H..R .27th June, 1940.L4.
