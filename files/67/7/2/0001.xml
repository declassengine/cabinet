In t e r --popart, lenta I C pmm i/s.j. e a on the m Recent ion ..of&quot;Children pverssas^The Etc Hon. Viscount Caldecote, C.B.E.The Rt.. Hon. Malcolm. MacDonald, M.P.My Lord and Sir,V/e have the honour to present our report on theenquiry which we were appointed to make.      Our tarms ofreference cr:e iTo consider offers from overseas to house and carefor children, whether accompanied or unaccompanied., fromthe European war zone residing in Great Britain.-,  includingchildren orphaned &quot;by the war, and to make recpinnendatlqpsthereon 0Tentative offers to take children from this countryfor the duration of the war have &quot;been received from Canada,the Commonwealth of Australia, Now Zealand and the union ofSouth Africa, and preliminary discussions have already been undertaken with the Governments of these Dominions.     Similaroffers have also b-sen received from private organisationsin the United States of America.we should therefore like  - at the cutset to conveyan expression of our wannest appreciation of the generousoffers received and of the humane motives by which they areinspired.      These offers are doubly welcomed.      If acceptedthey will provide a refuge from the ordeals of-war and a valuable character-building experience which will re-irfcrceclose and traditional ties.The recommendations set. cut telowj of course intended a;a basis for an approach to the Dominion Governments.,      They clprimarily with the problems arising out of the reception

of children in the Dojctinions, but scihe consideration hasalso &quot;been given to the possibility of sending children to other parts of the Empire and to the United States ofAmerica, supposing that such a procedure should &quot;be agreeable to the overseas authorities concerned.Under the regulations at present in force,children under the age of 15 do not require any c;xii permitsAll persons of the age of 15 and over require exit permit-iibefore they may leave the country.     Persons between the ages of IS and 50 are not allowed to leave the countryunless their journey is for reasons of national importanceer they are mothers accompanying young children abroad-In all cases of travel abroad,  questions of exchange controlarise and persons are not permitted to go to countries outside the sterling area or to send their children thereif such action would involve the use of sterling exchange.Subject to the above limitations it is,  therefore,evident that parents who are in a position to do so mayarrange privately for the evacuation of their children over-seas,     &quot;we are of opinion that it is undesirable that theworking of the Scheme should be unnecessarily hampered bythe need for dealing with such cases.      In order, however,to ensure that shipping space  in the future should be m.,.d?.available to the right categories of childrenso   that, a   proper     cross rsectio..o, ofthe child population be sent overseas, we recommend thatin future parents who are able to make their own arrangementsfor the evacuation of their children overseas, should berequired to obtain the permission of the Executive Bodyreferred to at 3(a) before they are allowed to leave thecountry.     Arrangements can be made with the Permit Office

to make this control effective.In view of the need to present out report without undue delay,  it has been limited to recpmrt? eridations withoutthe reasons upon which they are based.Our recommendations are as follows:-(1)    Offers from Overseas .   The tentative offers from canada,  the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand,  theUnion of South Africa,  other parts of the Empire and theUnited States of America should be gratefully acknow1edgedand a scheme should be agreed for receiving children from great Britain in these countries.(2)    Name of Scheme.The Scheme should be known as &quot;The Children&apos;overseas Reception Scheme&quot;.(3) Administration.(a) In this country,.   ,    The scheme should be administered by a smallExecutive Body (to be called the. Children&apos;s OverseasReception Board),    assisted by an adequate secretarial staff.This body would carry out the day to day work involved.Its Chairman should be a Minister responsible to Parliamentf*r the general policy of the scheme.The Minister should be advised by an AdvisoryCouncil composed of representatives of organisationswith experience of migration, education, and  the care oichildren, or of individuals with similar qualifications.-(b) In the receiving countries.This matter is one for the oversea Government,concerned; it is understood that central organisationswould be set up in each of the receiving countries to administer the scheme and to secure the welfare of thechildren

children.      The United Kingdom High Commissioner in the receiving Dominion will he instructed to keep in close touch with this body and a suitable person from this country should be specially appointed to his staff for thispurpose 0(4)    Scope of__the Scheme.(a)     A^e.The Scheme will probably have  to be confined for the present to children at school who havereached the age of 10 years and who are not yet 16 yearsof age.      Younger children might be included in exceptional circumstances.      Consideration was also given to thequestion    of evacuated children who might pass the overseaschool leaving age ana would,  therefore,  enter the labour market overseas.      It would be- unreasonable to expectoversea &apos; Governments to guarantee work to children on leaving school,  hue  the oversea reception comimi committees would continue to look after the welfare of children after theyhad reached the school leaving age and,  indeed,  throughout their stay overseas.(b)    Adults.For the time being the Scheme has beenconsidered on the supposition  that children would not he&apos;accompanied by parents.      It is possible  that special provision may be made later on for War widows with childrer: .(c)&apos; Orphanages.    No offers have been made forthe reception of orphanages,  but consideration should begiven to the individual circumstances of children inorphanages who might be suitable for reception overseas,(d)   &apos; Geographical .1 limits ;The Scheme she old be open to children from anywhere in Great Britain, whether residing  Inevacuation,

evacuation, neutral or reception areas.    If, however, thehurobers applying for evacuation overseas became very large,preference would probably have to be given to applicantswho are already evacuated or registered for evacuationunder the United Kingdom evacuation scheme.(e&apos;)    Nominations .We believe that many persons overseas wouldbe prepared to receive the children of friends or relativeswho might not be prepared to receive the children of aperson unknown to them.      Moreover, many persons would only be willing to agree to the evacuation of their children to the homes   of persons whom they know.      Perthese reasons, we strongly recommend that a system ofnomination should be included in the Scheme and that the reception bodies should be asked to meet  the wishes ofparents in this respect.(5)      Selection of Children.(a)    Machinery.Applications from parents of children attendinggrant-aided schools should he made through the localeducation authority of the district in which the children are at the moment residing, or wore residing.before.theywere evacuated under the Government SchemeApplications fromparents of

of children attending other schools should he madedirect to the Board.(b)   Medical Test.It will he for the Governments of the receivingcountries to decide upon the medical standards required,hut the medical examination will take place in thiscountry so that no child should he returned en medical grounds on arrival of the ship.      The Medical examinationof children attending grant-aided schools should he a function of the school medical service with such guidance as would satisfy the Governments of the receiving-countries.The medical examination of other children willhe conducted under arrangements that will satisfy the receiving Governments and will he of the same standardas that mentioned above.(6)    Escerts.It is essential that the responsibility forescorting the children during the voyage should he placedon qualified and experienced persons, to he selected bythe Board,      Each ship should also have its proper quota of trained nurses and doctors.      Offers have alreadybeen received from a number of voluntary organisationswho

who are prepared, to supply escorts, trained nurses anddoctors for this purpose.Escorts for the children from their homes tothe port of embarkation should he provided by localeducation authorities.(7)      Clothes.Arrangements should he made by the receivingbody to supply children on arrival with any extra clothesnecessary for local conditions.      The. Board should makea suitable per capita grant to meet this charge,(8)    Shipping.An examination is being made at the Ministry ofShipping as to the space available for passages for children.      Preliminary examination shows that,  givenproper notice, it should be possible to arrange forpassages for a considerable number of children withoutany alteration in the present schedules of shipping.If it were desired to move a larger number of children,extra ships would have to be allocated for this purpose.The Most adequate provision for the safety of the children on the voyage will be the subject ofdiscussion between the Admiralty and the Ministry ofShipping.      It will, however, be a]?preoiated that,  owingto the unprincipled raamier in which the enemy conductwarfare, certain risks must attend travel by sea, but these must of course be set against    the risks of attacks upon this country.(-9)      financial liabilities of parents.We are of opinion that on no account should there be any direct financial transactions between sending and receiving households.      Parents should, however, beexpected

expected to contribute towards the expenses of thescheme.parents of children at grant-aided schools shouldmake the same contribution as they would have made if their children had been evacuated under the evacuationscheme within this country.      Under this scheme parentsmay,  if they wish, contribute up to 9/-  a week per childtowards the cost of the billeting allowances paid by theGovernment to householders, hut where parents are preparedto offer only 6/- a week per child,  this contribution is accepted as a full discharge without question   as to the parents&apos; means.     Where parents are unable to offer a contribution of as much as 6/- a week per child, their contribution,  if any,  is assessed according to theircircumstances under a scale already prescribed.      Wesuggest the same procedure he applied to children underthe Ghildrens&apos; Overseas Reception Scheme.      Thesecontributions will be collected under the arrangements nowin force for the collecting of contributions under theGovernments Evacuation Scheme in this country.      children at grant-aided schools will receive free transport.The parents of children attending non-grant-aided schools may in general be asked to pay a somewhat,larger contribution towards the- expenses of the scheme *It should, however, be within the discretion, of the board to reduce this contribution to any extent according to thecircumstances of the parents.      The parents of thesechildren should also be expected to pay a reasonablesteamship fare to be assessed with some regard to the rate which might be paid by a migrant.      In a similar mannerthis charge could be modified according to the circumstancesof

of the parents.(10)      Cost to United Kingdom governments the very generous offers received from countires overseas have not yet been fully formulated, and it istherefore impossible to estimate the cost which will fallon the United Kingdom Government.      We recommend, however,that where the United Kingdom Government contributestowards the maintenance of children overseas it should doso at a flat rate,  irrespective of the actual contributions of individual parents.     We also recommend that subjectto any offers of shipping facilities that may be madeby other Governments, the United Kingdom Government should meet the cost of sea transport.(11)      Allied Refugee Children.The above recommendations relate only toBritish children.      We appreciate that requests may bereceived for the evacuation of Allied refugee children,and, in so far as the oversea - countries are prepared toreceive these children, we are anxious that they shouldtake their proper place within the scheme.      These children would not normally be attending school, and the restriction of the scheme to school attendance would be waived in their cases - subject to consideration of their individualcircumstances.      The scheme should not, however, be applicable to Allied refugee children already in employ-ne : .Applications or enquiries on behalf of Alliedrefugee children should be sent through the localauthority, responsible for their housing,  to the appropriat&quot;Consuls-General.      In the few cases where the refugee isnot housed by the local authority, the application shouldbe made direct to the respective Consuls-General.      Theseremarks

remarks apply to children of the following nationalities;-Belgian,  Czecho-Slovakian, Dutch, French, Norwegian and polish.We therefore recommend that?--(1)    The tentative offers from Canada,  theCommonwealth of Australia, New Zealand,  the Union, ofSouth Africa, other parts of the Empire and the UnitedStates of America,  should &quot;be gratefully acknowledged anda scheme should he agreed for receiving children from great Britain in these countries;(2)    The name of the scheme should he the&quot;Children&apos;s Overseas Reception Scheme&quot;;(3)    The scheme should he administered by theChildren&apos;s Overseas Reception Board., presided over bya Minister responsible to Parliament who shall be advised by an Advisory Council;r      (4)    The scheme will probably have to be confinedfor the present to school-children throughout Great Britaiwho have reached the age of 10 years and who have not reached 16 years of age.    Younger children might beincluded in exceptional circumstances.      Parents who wishto make their own arrangements should continue to do so,subject to sanction of the Board;(5)    Parents should be allowed to name relatives orfriends overseas to whom they would like their childrensent;(6)    Medical tests should be made in this country under arrangements agreed with the oversea authorities,  inorder to ensure that children shall not be returned on medical grounds on arrival overseas;

(7)    Parents of children at grant-aided schoolsshould he expected to contribute if able to do so, as inthe case of evacuated children in this country, with fretransport.      Parents of other children should contribute towards the expenses of the scheme and towards sea transport according to their circumstances;(8)    The United Kingdom Government should normallypay the cost of sea transport,  and make contributions towards the maintenance of the children at a flat per capita rate;(9)    The scheme should also apply in a similarmanner, so far as overseas Governments agree,  to Alliedrefugee children who are not in employment (Belgian,Czecho-Slovakian, Dutch, French, Norwegian and Polish)oWe are satisfied that a practicable scheme can be worked out on the basis of the recommendations made above, but we appreciate that, owing to the short-time at our disposal,  certain points may arise which wehave not foreseen, and we recommend that these should bedealt with at the discretion of the Board,&quot;We wish to record our appreciation of the helpwe have received under conditions of great difficulty frrour two Secretaries, Mr,  G. Kimber of the Dominions Officand Mr. J.P. Dodds of the Ministry of Health.We have the honour to be.My Lord and Sir,Your obedient servants,Oha ii-mar. .-
