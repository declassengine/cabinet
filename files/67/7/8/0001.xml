PASSIVE AIR DEFENCE MEASURES- AT VITAL FACTORIES.,i.v ., Paasive Air Defence&apos; measures are those required to betaken for the protection of personnel under the Civil Defence Actand under Section 13 of the Ministry of Supply Act,  for the purposeof securing the due functioning of an undertaking in the event ofwar.   (provided they are measures which cannot be enforced under anyother enactment).2,   ., Passive Air Defence measures consist mainly of (a)protection of personnel by provision of shelters (as required by theCivil Defence Act,.1939);   ,(b),protection of vital plant and provision of alternative sources of supply of electricity, gas and water (under Section 13 of the Ministry of Supply Act),    The steps taken are set out in greater detail- below,3,  - &apos; There is a Passive Air Defence Department in each of thethree;main Supply Departments (Ministry of Supply, Admiralty and aircraft Production Ministry)-; . they work in close, association withthe Air Raid Precautions Department of the Ministry of home security and with the Inter-Departmental Committee on Air RaidPrecautions in Government Contractors&apos; Viforks, on which the Treasuryis represented.k.   - In regard to the Ministry of Supply Act, the Ministry ofSupply has a central co-ordinating -function; 1 the Admiralty and theAircraft Production Ministry act in these matters as agents for theMinister&apos;Of Supply in relation to those contractors the main partof whose work is for the Admiralty and the Aircraft ProductionMinistry respectively.      The three staffs in dealing with measures taken for the- protection of personnel .under the Civil Defence Act(except in a few cases) act as agents for the Ministry of Home-Security.- ..      - . ,   .5.- The three Departments together have dealt with and-;-approved schemes. in respect of approximately 1500.firms,    This//number covered until recently all the firms on the vital lists of/contractors situated in specified areas or otherwise vulnerable.In addition,  they have dealt with some ,50.agency factories of theMinistry of Supply, shadow factories of the Ministry of Aircraft- Production, .and Royal Ordnance Factories, and -also a number of Governmentfinanced extensions to commercial factories. ,. The number of&apos; factories and extensions is constantly increasing,  as additionalagoncy,&apos; shadow or Ordnance Factories,  or. extensions^ are approvedor. commenced,  or come into operation,  or as additional commercialfactories or establishments are added, to the vital list.    The  . ,schemes are put in hand directly the necessary surveys /have beenmade;    in the case of new factories and. extensions the-Passive air defence measures are incorporated during construction.    The PassiveAir Defence planning for some 60 agency9 Ordnance or shadowfactories additional to the above 50 has been completed or is in hand.The total number of vital commercial factories and establishments towhich grants under the Ministry of Supply Act. are&apos; applicable,  atpresent in view,is about 1700o6. The approximate position of oho work as regards the 1550factories, already fully dealt with is as follows:--Civil Defence . Act Measures,,(&apos;a!)/&apos;Jprb&apos;vis.ion of Shelters/and equipment . and training, of personnel --:98$ completed. - &apos;&quot;-:&apos; - - This/J. 368.
This percentage.progress excludes shelters recentlystarted or to be started for increased number of employees, not previously contemplated   at factorieswhose:orders are increasing.    Such shelters are ordered to be provided as rapidly as possible, ...&quot;(b) . ,Provision of Control and key posts, minor, fire appliances, etc.,.&quot;&apos;:     .95/0 completed.  &apos; .   .(c).   Provision of First Aid and/or Cleansing facilities - Go%completed,, -The low percentage of progress, in regard to FirstAid and Cleansing facilities is due to the&apos;fact that thisprovision is not obligatory and that many of the firms have hitherto relied unduly on facilities provided by ,Local Authorities,    Th^re has latterly been a greatertendency to provide First Aid and Cleansing Stations, butbetter progress will be made if definite assurance is&apos;given that financial assistance will be: available for all measures of this type completed within a reasonable time.This matter is being taken up by the Ministry of Supplywith the Treasury and the.Ministry of Home Security.Ministry of Supply^Act Measures^The principal passive air defence measures under this &apos;.Act comprise the following:- . &apos;(a) Protection of vital plant - structural measures,  strengthening of walls,  etc,  - approximately 35% completed.(b) Weatherproof obscuration of light - 66^ completed.With regard to the comparatively small progress ofweatherproof obscuration,  this measure was not decided upon until just before the war started.    The delay incompleting it is due to unavoidable experimentation withtypes of obscuration,   and it has been greatly aggravated by the scarcity of materials,  including particularlytimber and steel.    Many schemes originally prepared, to utilise these materials had. to be altered..   The use :.of .alternative materials is constantly studied,  and a large quantity of jute canvas has been ordered from India :.which,.  after proofing, will provide a useful supplementarymaterial to alleviate the difficulty.(c) Major fire protection measures not catered for under theCivil Defence Act - e0gu the provision of trailer pumps,sprinklers, tanks9 wells etc, - approximately. 85% completed.(d) Alternative supplies of electricity, gas and water.    these have in general been provided for where directed, but it isimpossible to give a.percentage of completion in regard tothese measures. -A telegraphic circular was issued to its firms by theMinistry of Supply on 29th May 19u1,  requesting immediate -completion of all the measures which have been directed and asking for a report to be made of the action taken (copy attached).Replies received to this telegram are in general very satisfactory.Expeditory action has also been taken by- the Admiralty and theMinistry of Aircraft Production,, and in the case of their firmsthe position goneralljr is equally satisfactory.
7. The question of providing protection of vital plant,alternative&apos;-sourc.es of electricity etc,  and other&apos;measures underSection.. 13 Ministry of Supply Act at the works of a further 100Admiralty-&apos; and Ministry of Shipping firms (mostly of shipyards) isunder consideration and an early decision is anticipated,; It .was recently decided (on 2 3rd May) to take Ministryof Supply-;Act measures in. respect of h2 principal food factories.,throughout the country.    These had already been surveyed and thework in is hand urgently.    It has also recently been decided toapply. Ministry..of Supply Act measures to a number of iron andsteel works&apos;; 22 iron and steel works are now being surveyed andothers will, follow,&apos;:i &apos;:&apos;cy-Measures are being approved for the provision of alternative supplies of electric power and stand-by sets ofwinding gear for certain groups of collieries.8,    &quot;:-;&quot;&apos;&apos; - Additional measures &apos; considered necessary.(a)&apos;!;&apos; Pe&apos;rlmetcr- window, protection.Instructions have been sent to all factories on the list to cover the; windows .on the outside of the factory perimeter with wirenetting as a protection against small incendiary bombs whichmight be thrown in from outside;,(b) Improvements to perimeter fencing.      Improvements to perimeterfencing,,  including provision of additional fencing where necessaryaround vital factories as anti-sabotage protection, has been allowed under Section 13 Ministry of Supply&apos;Act, but .the demands on this account have hitherto been comparatively small.    In thepresent situation widespread demands for improvements have developed,  and the military authorities and police are constantlyrequiring factories to improve or provide such protection.    Wherefencing is necessary, to meet the deficiency of steel for theusual unclimbable fencing,  the alternative use of barbed wirefencing of suitable type has been indicated to vital factories.(c) Improvements to Lightings      Throughout the course of thePassive Air Defence work since the early days of the war,  thePassive Air Defence staff have impressed upon factories thenecessity for improving the standards of artificial lighting inorder to enable production work to be carried on efficiently underblackout conditions, but there has never been any promise of agrant in respect of improvements in lighting,  and if there is tobe any great improvement in the general standard of lighting,  itseems probable that a grant must be given in respect of capitalexpenditure incurred0    It is considered that payment in aid need notjjexceed the 35% capital grant, and that no promise need be given of   Iadditional assistance depending on the proportion of government work.    Broadly, it is considered that factories ought to have a standard of lighting of about 10 to 15 foot candles illuminationallowing for skilled bench work to proceed under blackoutconditions;    at present they have,  on average, no more than h to6 foot candles illumination which suffices only for work of a simple character not involving close attention.    This matter isbeing taken up by the Ministry of Supply,(d) Improvements to ventilation.    Blackout measures have broughtto notice the necessity lor improving the ventilation of factories in order to eliminate a measure of fatigue of workers caused byclosing windows,  etc,  in the hours of darkness and by the prolongation of hours of work in blackout conditions.    In some important cases additional ventilation has been sanctioned asexpenditure/
expenditrure; under, Section 1 3 Ministry of Supply Act, butremedial!/ measures, in this&apos; respect have not been generallyenfoi^6&apos;ed-xupon firms by reason of the policy of economisingas-ofiudjhras-possible &quot;in the cost of schemes.    In the new situation the improvement of ventilation should be enforced..%      V&apos;&quot;.&apos;;.A suggestion has been made that additional lateralprotection, might be provided by earthing up exterior walls&apos; of factories, r-   This has&apos; been considered;, but it is .found thatin the ;..f.ew places where conditions would&apos; allow of this, being done the additional protection afforded would be incommensuratewith&apos;the^labour and expense involved,10. The total cost of Ministry of Supply Act measures-;,approved ,to:.date is approaching  S-g- million, of which 35$ will fall on central revenues as a Government statutory grant in aid5of the work.    Except in-the case of mines and food factories,the Treasury have agreed to contractors being paid a proportionof the remaining, 65% of expenditure equal to the proportionwhich. Government-work. . bears to the contractor&apos;s work&apos;from all -sources.    The commitment in regard to the Government grant of&apos;35% is approaching.  3 million,      This is the figure which hashitherto been regarded- as a maximum in a general understanding between the Ministry of Supply and the Treasury. &quot;&quot;-To cater for,further factories being&quot;dealt with, and by reason, of rises inprices,  the development of the technique of protection,  and theaddition.&apos;of, items not originally contemplated,  it is necessarytb&apos;exceedi this, amount.    The Ministry of, Supply will take&quot; this up with-the ,Treasury;&apos; ^immediately. ...: -       . A ,rough estimate, of the probable capital- expenditurenecessary under Section 13 Ministry of Supply Act, as at present-envisaged, is..as &quot;follows (all figures are of course Veryapproximate,):-.
