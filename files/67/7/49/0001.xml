COP/ NO.     P &amp;REPLACEMENT OF MERCHANT SHIIPING LOSSES.Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping.I have seen the First Lord*s Memorandum on Merchant Shipbuilding -W.P.(G)(40)183,I agree with him that, in present circumstances, we can afford to suspend, for the time being, the laying down of further coasting vessels and cargo vessels suitable only for the short sea trades.     I do not, however,think that it should be decided at this stage to reduce to 1,100,000 grosstons the general programme of merchant shipbuilding in 1941.     This programme was fixed at 1,500,000 gross tons at the beginning of the year, whenresponsibility for merchant shipbuilding was transferred from the Ministryof Shipping to the Admiralty and fixed not as a maximum but as a minimum.It is, I suggest, important to bear in mind that interference with output is bound to result from attacks upon the shipbuilding yards and that, if weaim merely at 1,100,000 tons, there is a grave risk that our actual output will fall seriously short even of that figure.The import figures, cxlcuding oil and molasses, for the month of Junewere 4,054,000 tons, following an import of 4,177,000 tons,   in &quot;May, while this rate does not reach tho forecasts, it has been adversely affected by many causes of dislocation to shipping operative during the last few weeks,some of which were temporary.   But as wo pass into   the Autumn and, later,into full winter&apos;-conditions, the rate of import must fall.It is true that, with tho disappearance from the Allied programme of the importing needs of France and with the re-transfer to ourselves of much ofthe Allied and Neutral shipping which had been allocated to the service ofFrance, we appear to have, upon a calculation, a tonnage sufficient to enable us to.meet the programmes of the buying Departments.     But numerous adversefactors tend to reduce our importing capacity.     We ore relying to a verylarge extent upon the services of Allied and Neutral vessels.   I am taking all possible measures to secure and retain the loyalty.of the crews of these ships, which are in most cases, including the seized Danish vessels, manned by their own nationals.     It would be a material   added safeguard if we were able rapidly to arm all these ships, as this would make the crews more willingto sail in waters and to ports liable to attack.     In certain contingencies,however, - the same reliance cannot be placed upon all these ships and theircrews as upon British ships and British crews, and delays and interruptionsin the use of this- tonnage are already occurring.Apart from this, increasing difficulties ore being experienced inutilising vessels with speeds under 9 knots.     In winter conditions a much larger number of vessels will fail to attain this minimum speed on the atlantic passage and, unless&apos; special convoys can be instituted for their protection we must expect either an undue rate of loss or partialimmobilisationsTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE ISO PERT Y OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S (XNWNlEm,secret.p.(C-)(4q)199.WAR CABINET26th July, 1940.
The closing of the English Channel to large ships and the abandonment of theWestern for the Northern Approaches add materially to the length of voyage for all vessels destined for the East Coast, and particularly London.     There will also &quot;bea greatly increased liability to marine damage in the winter if a large amount ofshipping is passed through the Pentland Firth or the Pair Isle Channel.Requisitions for military contingencies arc still heavy, including retentionof many large cargo carrying steamers for possible services to Ireland,Finally, I would like to call attention to the present rate of losses which,as the Prime Minister remarks in Ms covering note, have recently shown a large increase.     The average weekly rate of loss from submarine sinkings alone of vesselsunder the British flag during the five weeks ended the 14th July was about 40,000gross tons or five times as great as the average weekly rate of loss from the1st October to the 9th June.   It is, however, necessary to look not merely at therate of loss of British ships, but of British and foreign vessels taken together.Our   Allies, and the neutral countries such as Sweden and Greece upon which we rely,are not in a position to replace their own losses.     The combined average rate of loss from submarine sinkings alone during the same five weeks has been at the rateof 70,000 gross tons per week.   To these figures must be added losses by mining,surface raiders and aerial attack.     The latter have recently been severe and manyvessels not actually sunk have been seriously damaged and will take months to repair.In considering the building programmes, allowance must also be made for losses due to marine risks.    When all causes of loss are taken into account, the tonnageat our disposal has been destroyed in recent weeks at a weekly rate of about116,000 gross tons or an annual rate of about 6 million gross tons.We may, no doubt, hope that the stoppage of traffic through the Channel, the cessation of the specially difficult conditions which prevailed during theevacuation from France and the resort to the Northern Approaches, will reduce therecent rate of loss to less serious dimensions.   But both recent experience and thelong term considerations, to which full weight ought to be given if we have to faceanother two years of war, appear to me to point to these conclusions :-(l) that we can afford to slow down the rate of construction of coasting and short sea vessels and thus increase facilities for constructing escorts;(2) that it is urgently necessary to make available escorting forces to   theextent required to protect vessels of varying speeds from submarine andother attack.     It is not possible to forgo the use of ships under8 knots and with winter conditions and the kind of cargoes, e.g, fullcargoes of steel, which they vri.ll have to carry, many of our vessels willnot make 8 knots.(3) that, in spite of the importance of an increase in escorting forces, wecannot afford to drop our building programme of deep sea traders,including tankers, much below 1-g- million gross tons per annum in 1941.Indeed, if the recent rate of loss contiiu.es, it will be vital to increasethe programme substantially above that level.     Besides decreasing the death rate we must increase the birth rate.All, however, that I ask at the moment is the postponement of any decision toreduce the rate of output during the year 1941, apart from the temporary suspension of construction of coasting and short sea traders.R.II.C.Ministry of Shipping.26th July, 1940.
