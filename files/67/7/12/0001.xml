SECRET. War Cabinet. .&apos;2wTpT(GT(40)l62 - Copy No. *. P.June&apos; 27th. BURMA AND THE WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for   Burma.The appended telegrams exchanged   with the Governor of Burmaraise a question which is of importance both in itself and also in sofar as indirectly it   affects the Indian problem.His Majesty&apos;s   Government promised Burma in 1931 that herprospects of constitutional advance would not be prejudiced byseparation from India,    and that the constitutional objective forseparated Burma would remain-the progressive realisation of responsible government as an integral part of the Empire.    This declaration was repeated and explained during the Burma   Round Table Conference, duringthe debates on the passage of the India and Burma Acts of 1935 ^d last autumn by two statements which the Governor of Burma was authorised tomake   on 7th and 24th November (c.f. respectively, WM(39)7CthConclusions Mnute 10, and Wld(39) 91st Conclusions Minute 12).    Thesecond of these specifically stated for the first time in so manywords   that the constitutional objective   held out to Burma is &quot;the attainment of dominion   Status&quot;:    and it is only to this extent thatthe latest pronouncement to   Burma shows any advance on what has been said from the outset in 1931*    and even this has throughout beentaken   as implied. It is fair to say, therefore, that the hopes that have been held out to Burma of attaining   Dominion   Status have beenheld out as not inferior to those held out to India.     It may be addedthat, in some respects, Burma&apos;s prospects of realising these hopesappear   more favourable than India&apos;s have been up to the present, sinceBurma is already working&apos; fairly satisfactorily a Constitution which,although   of a unitary character, is closely comparable with thatevolved for the Federation of India which has yet to come into being,and since   she is free from the serious communal issue which has hither-to impeded constitutional   progress in India.     In these circumstances,whatever reply   is given to the Burman Ministers&apos; request for adeclaration that, at the end of the war, a constitution will be grantedwhich will enable Burma at once to take her due place as a fully self-governing and equal member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, asit may   then be (if this   is   what their ambiguous phrasing means), itiis, 1 think, important that it should   be so Y/orded as to avoidprejudging the Indian situation either by going beyond anything that we.may be able to say to or about India,   or, on the other hand, by being 1of   so negative a character as to arouse suspicion in India ofour good faith in regard to the corresponding declarations that have -been made as to India&apos;s constitutional progress - and, of course,it must also avoid being so negative as to lead Burmans to suspectthe sincerity of the earlier pronouncements to them.As regards the possible reactions on the Indian situation, itwill be remembered that the Governor-General has promised India&quot;Dominion Status of the Statute of Westminster variety&quot; and has stated&quot;that it is our desire that the period intervening before this isattained should be the shortest practicable; and that in my recentanswer to a question in the House of Commons 1 said that the re-examination of the Act that we had promised after the war necessarilyimplied discussion and negotiation and not dictation; that we had no desire to delay any of the steps that may pave the way towards an agreed/

BURMA OFFICE.S.W.1.L. S. A.agreed settlement that will take account of the legitimate claims of all communities and interests; that, on the contrary, we were very anxious to make our contribution towards such a settlement.Lord Linlithgow has invited Jar. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah tosee him this week in order to try to secure from them at any rate a provisional agreement between the two Communities which would enabletheir representatives to take an active part in the Governments bothof the Centre and of the Provinces, on the lines which were indicatedin my answer in the House of Commons.       The general trend of Indianpublic opinion suggests that there is now at any rate a possibility efa response to such an appeal; but, as the attached telegrams show tobo the case in Burma, such response is not unlikely to be coupled witha request for more precise assurances as to India&apos;s future position and status after the war. The terms of the reply to such a request from india, if and when it is made, will be a matter to be considered bythe War Cabinet.Meanwhile, I suggest (Appendix VI), for the approval of the iVarCabinet, a draft xeply to the Burman Premier&apos;s message the terms ofwhich the Governor, in his telegram 4C2-C, accepts as suitable from hispoint of view and are such as not, I think, to prejudge either waythe consideration of the larger Indian issue. It will be seen thatthe reply which I suggest really puts off till the conclusion of the warany final answer to the main request which the Burman Ministers havemade;    but, as s.n immediate measure, partly as evidence of the sincerity of the declarations previously made, partly to give theBurmans grounds for feeling that they are taking a definite part inthe organisation, so far as Burma is concerned, of the common war effort which they have unconditionally pledged themselves to help, theGovernor is to be authorised to announce his intention to appoint aBurman as one of the three Counsellors whom the Act empowers him toappoint to assist him in the administration of the EeservedDepartments of Government. The Governor will see to it that themore important duties continue to be discharged by his two EuropeanCounsellors and that the association of the Burman with them does not prejudice the secrecy of the matters with which the latter have todeal, and is confident that he can without difficulty restrict theBurman Counsellor&apos;s functions to matters of minor importance in theadministration of Defence.Apart from this immediate action, which may be regarded as an earnest of our sincerity and - it will be seen from the Governor&apos;telegram 40CC - is strongly recommended as such by senior Europeanofficers, the reply which I propose to the Burman Ministers promisesthat, at the end of the war, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be readyto discuss, in effect, the means by which and the extent to which itmay be possible, in the then circumstances, to give the BurmanGovernment a greater share in Defence questions and External Affairs..The inclusion of this promise is in accordance with my main purposethat what is said to Burma at this moment should neither go beyond what has already been said to India, nor fall so far short of that as tocreate suspicion in Indian or Burman minds;    for the wording of thispromise corresponds closely, mutatis mutandis, with what the Governor-General undertook in his statement of 3.7th October last when ho said&quot;And I am authorised now by His Majesty&apos;s Government to say that at theend of the war they will be very willing to enter into consultation withrepresentatives of the several communities, parties and interests inIndia and with the Indian Princes, with a view to securing their aid andco-operation in the framing of such modifications as may seem desirable.&quot;Sir A. Cochrane&apos;s last telegram shows that he is confident of successfullypreventing his Ministers from reading too much into the very general termsof the undertaking.

5S9-C. Personal.    My personal telegram 369-C, 18th June.Premier has just sent me a statement of the Government&apos;s policy towardsthe war in the following terms.     My comments follow separately.    Begins.At this critical juncture in the history of the world and of thewar of freedom and democracy against brute force, the policy of theGovernment of Burma is to give the utmost help in the common task ofmaking the forces of freedom and democracy triumphant in the presentconflict.The Government of Burma is a representative government and cannot take adequate action&apos;in pursuance of above policy without theapproval and co-operation of the people of Burma, whom they represent.Nor can any action they take be fully effective unless they are placed inrespect of defence and&apos; external affairs in the same position as the fullyself-governing members of the Commonwealth.While, therefore, the policy outlined above is unconditional, theGovernment of Burma would, strongly urge upon His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthe necessity of satisfying the legitimate aspirations of the people of burma by making a declaration forthwith to effect that on the terminationof present v/ar, His Majesty&apos;s Government will grant Burma a constitution which will enable her to take at once her due place as a fully self-governing and equal member of any Commonwealth or Federation of freenations that may be established as a result of the war.(Signed)    Maung Pu,June, 22nd.II.Telegram from Governor of Burma dated 22nd June, 1940.592-C.    Personal.      My personal telegram 389-C, June 22nd.Deliberations of Ministers on terms of their statement of policy havebeen prolonged.      They all desire Allied victory and also that Burmamay become a Dominion within the Commonwealth and, as statement shows,they have made no attempt to bargain.     A majority of Ministers were willing to give a simple statement of full support but minority,led by U Saw, took the not altogether unreasonable view that they mustframe their statement in such a way as to satisfy public opinion, and agreement on terms of this statement was only reached after considerable discussion amongst themselves.2. I have only one comment to make on the terms of the statement.The reference in the last sentence to &quot;any Commonwealth or Federation of free nations that may be established as a result of the war&quot; might bethought to cover a Federation outside the Empire, but, read as a general statement of policy in conjunction vdth the last sentence of the second paragraph, I do not think the point is of material importance.3. I hope you will feel disposed to telegraph a reply for communication to Ministers and the public.     I realise, however, thatyou may not wish to do so immediately, but I am asking Premier to with-hold publication of statement until he hears from me again in the hopethat/Telegram from Governor of Burma dated 22nd June, 194G.
that it will be possible to release it and your reply at the same time.4. Apart from any general statement which you may be disposed to authorise me to make I consider appointment of BurmeseCounsellor for period of the war would do a great deal tcstrengthen the position of Ministry and to ensure full supportof great majority of people for our war effort.     This matter was discussed with Ministers at considerable length on24th October 1939, and a report of proceedings was sent to LordZetland with my personal letter of 25th October, 1939.Ministers are not alone amongst Burmans in attaching greatimportance to association of Burmans with Defence Department andin view of fact that Counsellor acts in advisory capacity i feel it is possible as well as expedient to meet their desire.The senior Burmese member of Burma Civil Service is in my viewstoo junior for consideration and I should also prefer a non-official on the ground that his duties will be political in the sense.of obtaining public support for Defence measures,There, is no reason to expect difficulty in division of dutiesbetween European Counsellor responsible for External affairs and for vital dealings with Army Headquarters and those ofBurmese Counsellor who would be mainly concerned with explainingand popularising Defence measures and encouraging recruitment.On the important question of whether secrecy could be maintainedI do not believe there would be any leakage which would prove embarrassing so far as Burma&apos;s defences are concerned.     Withregard to documents relating to foreign policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and cognate matters I see no difficulty in ensuring that these are seen only by Counsellor concerned, thissystem normally operates now.5. If you approve of this proposal for the appointmentof Burman as officiating Counsellor for period of thewar,  I propose consulting Premier informally on question ofwho should be appointed.      It is conceivable that he or another Minister might wish to have post.Ill
Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor of Burma.Dated 24th June 1940.444. Personal.  Your personal telegrams 22nd June, 389 and 392-C.References are to paragraphs of your 392-C.1&apos;.    I agree that Ministers&apos; demand for declaration, though regrettable,was to be expected and could not be prevented.2.    I agree that phraseology is ambiguous but that, point is immaterialat present.3.    I must get Cabinet approval of any statement in reply, and in my immediately following telegram send for your comments first provisionalduccd     draft.    In the meantime I hope you can induce Premier to withholdpp.VI.      publication of his message.4. and 5.    I appreciate political attractiveness of appointing Burmanas Counsellor and as you will see from provisional reference to this indraft reply I am disposed to agree to   suggestion, but, before committingmyself, I would like to have your comments on the following points -(a) When you say in paragraph 4 that. Counsellor acts in advisory capacity, I presume that you mean that responsibility for any action that he takes lies ultimately with Governor and not with him.   I agreethat that is legal position, but I assume that, in practice, asubstantial amount of authority to take decisions on your behalf isdelegated by you to your   present Counsellors for otherwise I do not see how you have managed to discharge your many functions under S.7;.Are you satisfied that, in practice, a similar rTelegation of authorityto take decisions could be withheld from a Burman Counsellor?   If not,his functions would not be purely advisory in the ordinary sense of the- term.(b). I accept your view that there is no suitable Burman officialavailable and that a Burman Counsellor must be selected from non-officialranks.   As Counsellor he will.not only be appointed by Governor anddismissable by Governor as Ministers also are, but wholly responsible to Governor, and, moreover, by accepting office as Counsellor he willbecome disqualified by s.25(l) (a), from being or becoming member ofthe Legislature.    It follows that, unless he be chosen from outsidethe Legislature, he must resign from it and a fortiori from Ministry.(c) If Burman Counsellor is therefore inevitably outside Ministry,do you anticipate   possibility of friction or intrigue between him and ministers?   This apprehension   seems to&quot;receive support from point which you made In paragraph 4 of proceedings of 24th October.IV .    .Telegram from Governor of Burma, dated 26th June t 1940.400-C. Personal.   Your personal telegram No. 444, 24th June.1.     I believe that Ministers genuinely regard their statment as one of unconditional support.     I have&apos; been informed that in earlierdraft, 3rd paragraph referred to a &quot;demand&quot; for a declaration by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.     This, however, was modified to &quot;governor general would strongly urge.&quot;     The text of your reply not yet received,
I will answer as soon.as possible. - ........2.   Your paragraph (a).&apos;  I regret that use in my previous telegram of words&quot;advisory capacity&quot; in relation to Counsellor Yvas ambiguous without fullerexplanation.    It is correct that a large number of matters are dealt, with byCounsellor without reference to me and. what I had in mind was. that in the case ofa Counsellor if his views are not acceptable I- can over-rule him without -&quot;  .providing an excuse as in the case of a Minister for a ministerial crisis or, in aless important matter, for being accused of an excessive use of.powers reserved tome in-ministerial field.   In addition in allocation of. subjects between European andBurman Counsellors for Defence matters as distinct from scheduled areas it is proposedto give Burman duties which are&apos; not likely to impose upon him responsibility for advising an important matters.   There is obviously a slight risk he may feel.thathe is being excluded, from full possession in control of defence matters but I do not anticipate serious difficulty on this point.    In.my personal view, and-I have firsthand spontaneous evidence.that a number of Burma Civil Service Officers holdingresponsible positions share this view, the appointment of a. Burma Counsellor willhave an excellent effect in the country far outweighing the disadvantages inherent in adopting that course,3. (b).    Your remarks have been noted.4,(c).   The - views expressed in paragraph No.; 4 of my, note of October 24thwere given in circumstances in which I was not prepared to suggest -appointment of aBurmaiCounsellor and were designed to prevent further discussion.cn the subject.The circumstances are. now changed and. I do not anticipate intrigue&apos;&apos;or friction between a BurmaiCounsellor and &apos;Ministers and I propose-to continue&apos; customary weeklymeetings with Ministers at which matters relating to the war are- discussed.&apos; : .    . V.-   -      .Telegram from Governor of Burma,, dated 26th June, 1940.402-C.    Personal.    Youix telegram No.445 dated 24th June.   Ivy comments on your draft reply are as follows. *(&quot;&quot;reproduced as app. Yl)It-seems-probahle that penultimate sentence of the. message will attract mostattention here.   After careful.consideration I am unable to suggest an alternativeand more satisfactory form of words and if Ministers raise the matter with me Ipropose to repeat an argument 1 have often used - that. Dominion Status is not a formof constitution, and that there must -obviously be- close, examination and considerationof alterations in present constitution required to give that measure of self-government which would justify the attainment of-status of a Dominion.VI.   &quot;Proposed reply to Burman Ministers.Please express to your Ministers His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s deepappreciation of their unconditional offer, as representatives of the people of burma, to give their utmost help in the common task of prosecuting the war againstthe forces of evil and securing the triumph of freedom and democracy.   As evidenceof their appreciation, and in order to secure/closest co-operation possible betweenthe people of Burma and the- Governor in discharging the functions entrusted to himby s.7 of the Burma Act, particularly in the all-important - sphere of Defence, HisMajesty&apos;s Government approve your suggestion that you should forthwith invite arepresentative Burman to serve as one of your Counsellors to assist you in theexercise of those functions.As regards the question of future constitutional development, the policyand intentions of His Majesty&apos;s&apos;Government have been.clearly declared in the statements which you delivered to your Ministers on the 7th and 24th November thatthey will continue to use their best endeavours to promote the attainmentDominion status as being the objective of Burma&apos;s constitutional progress.     Atthis moment it is clearly impossible to predict -what will be the world situation at the end of the war, whadfc aspects the requirements of Burma^s defence.: and external affairs problems will assume in that situation, and. to what extent Burma w ill hersebe in a. position to cope w ithh th ose requirements.    It&apos;, is only   in the light of circumstances that may   actually   obtain at the time that these questions can usefulbe considered and discussed, but, when the war is brought to a victorious end, HisMajesty &apos;s Government will b e very   willing to enter on a discussion of them.
