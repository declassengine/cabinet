THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PI OPBRTY OF HIS BRITANIIIC MAJESTY1SGOVElSliiJIJT.&apos;SECRET .. COPY NO. ^W.P.(G)  (40)  161.2Vth June, 1940.WAR     CABINETUSE OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE AR1-.Y.Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War.1. In order to meet the need for training more men andat the same time to utilise facilities that are still available,I ask my colleagues to consider the use of the Public Schools.The disadvantages of interrupting education are fully realised but the national needs are urgent.     Schools provide, a means of enabling soldiers to be quickly accommodated whenother comparable premises are fully used,2. To make full use of schools advantage would be taken of :-A c c ommo da t i on.O.T.C. equipment,O.T.C. officers and staff.Physical Training staff.The available accommodation is shov/n in Appendix &quot;A&quot;.3. It will be necessary to decide whether all these schools should be used or whether there should be anyexemption on account of the dislocation which would be caused in schools where there are only a few boarders and a high proportion of day-boys.     In such cases the accommodation take]over would be very small in comparison with the number of bo.y&quot;3displaced.      In schools that have small houses the &quot;overheads&quot;and cooking arrangements would be uneconomical.The figures in Appendix &quot;A&quot; lead to the conclusionthat v/ith deductions for schools already occupied by GovernmentDepartments, etc., it is likely that suitable permanent accommodation for approximately 50,000 would be immediately available at the expense of displacing 75,000 boys.4. Owing to the variety of accommodation and facilities the number of soldiers to be trained at the different schools will vary.     It is therefore proposed that these establishmentsshould be regarded as training units, i.e. the personnel whentrained will be drafted to field units.     It will be necessaryto create certain Officer Cadet Training Units to cope with theprovision of officers for the increasing Army and this can bebrought into the scheme.5&quot; If this proposal is approved the programme would be:-(a)    Provision of Staffs. 1st July./0.T.C, officers and P.S.Is.Other officers and staff, (--uartermastersetc, cooks/.(b)/

- JAssembly of person..iel0Calling-up arrangements.Taking over of properrty.2:hid July.20th-21st July.1st-14th July,6.Further steps to be taken immediately would be:-(a) Selection of O.T.C.  officers and Com landing Officers.(b) Selection of school staff to remain employed, e.g.domestic staff.(c) Details of property to be taken over.(d) Higher organisation, e.g. affiliation of each SchoolTraining Unit to I.T.C.  or other Training Unit in thevicinity.    (All O.T.CS. are linked to a RegimentalDepot in peace).7. The question of using the universities is being examined, end it is my intention to put before my colleaguescertain proposals in this connexion very shortly.THE WAR OFFICE.27th June, 1940.
