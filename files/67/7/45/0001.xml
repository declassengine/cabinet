S E C R E T.W.P. (G)(UO)  195. COPY NO.    S&quot;1T20TH JULY&quot; 2  19UO.&apos;7AR    CABINET.ALIENS.   -Revised Memorandum &quot;by the Lord Privy Seal.At its meeting on the 1 7th July, the War cabinet considered a memorandum (Paper No0 W,Pc(G)(hO) 187) whichI had been asked to prepare on the subject of aliens.    Asa result of various points raised at this meeting, I was invited to revise my memorandum in certain respects,  and thefollowing revised memorandum is based on the views expressed at that meeting,  and on certain views expressed at the subsequent meeting on 18th July.The question of aliens in this country involvesfar-reaching considerations.There are in this country at the present time anumber of foreign Governments of countries which have beenoverrun by Germany,      There are also less formal committeessuch as that connected with General de Gaulle.     These bodies are necessarily in formal relation to the Foreign Office onthe civil side and to the Service Departments on the militaryside.There are also a number of citizens of enemy origin,the great majority of whom are violently opposed to our common enemy.     The civilian nationals of conquered countries are necessarily the concern of a number of departmentsincluding the Security Services and the Ministry of Labour.The problem with which we have to deal has itsnegative and positive aspects.      The former necessarilyentails that in any case of doubt there should be a biasin favour of national security,  i.e., that every doubtfulalien, whether of enemy, allied or neutral origin shouldbe put in a position where he or she cannot do harm.The latter aspect is equally important.      In a war of ideals every effort should be made to enlist on our sideall those who are opposed to Nazism and to utilise their services to the full against the common enemy,Public opinion is apt to swing violently from the negative to the positive aspect.      Sympathy with refugees

may lead to dangerous laxity.     Excessive fear of enemyactivities may lead to the loss of valuable services and toa crippling of the offensive inside occupied Europe, whichshould he a major operation in this war.Aliens in this country may be divided into thefollowing categories:-A. Those who are dangerous.     These should be interned and if possible deported.     Theremay be among these persons who have beennaturalised in recent years.B. Citizens of neutral countries such as theUnited States for whom no special provision is needed.C. Aliens who are neither useful nor dangerous, suchas the aged,    and the children who onlyneed care.D. The potentially useful -Those of military age who should be either iniheir own national forces orin a foreign legion.Those possessed of definite industrialor agricultural skill who should be absorbed into industry.    The Ministerof Labour has, I understand, underconsideration the formation of anInternational Labour Force.Persons of no special qualifications whoare difficult to fit into industry, suchas black-coated workers.     These should he put to work of some kind,    Idleness is dangerous.Persons of high technical or scientificqualifications whose services should heutilised.Persons whose literary qualifications or political affinities make them potentiallyuseful for work against the Nazis.The Cabinet decided at its meeting on the 18th July,first, that the conditions at present governing the release from internment of onemy aliensshould be revised, so as to ensure that persons who were known to he actively hostile to the present regime in germany or Italy, or whom for other sufficient reasons it was undesirable to keep in internment, should, be released, and secondly, that the internal management, though not the safeguarding, of the internment camps should be transferred from the Secretary of State for War to the Secretary of Statefor the Home Department.

With these decisions as a background to my recommendations, I now proceed, to certain suggestions which should in my opinion be followed as regards the internment of aliens and the welfare of aliens wheninterned,I recommend that:-(l)   The Home Secretary should continue to be responsiblefor determining security questions affecting aliensgenerally, and in particular for the internment orrelease from internment of individual enemy aliensor classes of enemy aliens.(2)   The Home Secretary, in the discharge of his responsibility for the control of enemy aliens, shouldbe assisted by an advisory committee composed of -whose function it would be, inter alia -(i) to keep under review the application of theprinciples laid down in regard to the internmentof enemy aliens and to make to the Home Secretarysuch suggestions and recommendations thereon asthey think fit;(ii) to advise the Home Secretary on such proposalsfor modifying the internment policy as he may refer to them from time to time; and(ili) to examine, and make recommendations upon, suchindividual cases or groups of cases as may bereferred to them from time to time by the HomeSecretary.(3)   The Home Secretary should be responsible for theinternal management of internment camps, althoughthe War Office should assist by providing the accommodation and should be responsible for finding the Commandants and military guards.     The War office should also assist with Q Services and medical services, in so far as this may prove to he the most economical and convenient means of providing these services.(h)   The Minister of Labour and National Service should beresponsible for finding work for aliens not ininternment c amps.(5)   An Advisory Council should he appointed to keep under general review all arrangements for whichthe Government are in any way responsible affectingthe welfare of aliens in this country.     ThisAdvisory Council should be composed as follows:-The Master of the Rolls (Chairman)Sir Herbert EmersonGeneral Neill MalcolmLord Crahborne. Sir H. Emerson(Chairman)(Vice Chairman)Mr. BUVr, WillinlcMr. Noel BakerLord WolmerLord WintertonMr. G-raham WhiteMr. George LathanMr. W0E0 WoolleyMiss RathboneLady AmpthillGeneral Neill MalcolmHon. Edward Cadogan

The functions of this Advisory Council should be:-(a) to suggest measures for maintaining the morale of aliens in this country so as to hind them more closely to our common cause.(h) To review and if necessary to suggest measures for the coordination, to the end descrihed in(a) above, of the work of the various RefugeeCommittees and other voluntary organisations concerned with aliens in this country.(c) To maintain contact with the various GovernmentDepartments having responsibilities in connectionwith refugees and other classes of aliens andwith foreign Governments or National Committeesestablished in this country,(d) To advise and assist the Home Office in thearrangements made for the welfare of enemy aliensin internment camps.(e) To study, and make recommendations upon, theproblem of finding occupations for enemy aliensin internment camps.In view of the general character of the functionsassigned to this Advisory Council, and having regardto the effect on British prestige abroad of ourtreatment of refugees and other classes of aliens inthis country, I recommend that the Council should heset up hy the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and should work in close association with the RefugeeDepartment of the Foreign Office.The Foreign Office should arrange for the appointmentof liaison officers who vrould make the necessary contact between the Council and any other Departments concernedin their work.(Intld.)
