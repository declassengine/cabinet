SECRET.W.P.(G)  (40)  191,.July 19th. 1940o Copy No. SiCABINET,l&apos;:PANg-ATLANTIC AIR SERVICE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.For about two months last summer, a once-weekly air service was successfully operated across the Atlantic to New York, via Foynes,Newfoundland and Montreal.It was the intention to operate a similar British service this summer, beginning in May or June.In March last, the Cabinet decided with regret that the twocivil flying-boats which were to be used on it should be handed overto the Royal Air Force.This was done.   Unfortunately the boats were lost in theNorway operations,In April, the Cabinet decided that tho Royal Air Force shou3also have the three&apos;civil flying-boats of an improved type, known as &quot;Qboats, which were designed for ocean work and approaching completion.The Royal Air Force now have these long-range boats and are preparing them for service.Recently, the flying-boat route to Egypt, India, Australiaand the Far East has been interrupted and we are now working a shorter route starting from Durban which will be connected with WestAfrica by an overland air route via Khartourn0As soon as this trans-African route is fully organised, itwill be necessary to provide a strong civil air link between WestAfrica and the United Kingdom.Two flying-boats - the only long-range ones left - havebeen earmarked for this purpose.They will be required for the West Africa connection bythe end of September.Meanwhile, I propose to use them on weekly flights to canada and the United States to meet the request of the ForeignOffice, Dominions Office and Ministry of Information for british air communication with North America.I hope the Cabinet will approve of this temporaryarrangement0The shortening of the flying-boat route to the East hasmade two Empire type flying-boats permanently surplus and these have been handed over to the Royal Air Force.AcHoMeStAir Ministry,19th July, 1940.
