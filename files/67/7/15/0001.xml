Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1940.secret. Copy No.W.P. (g.) (*0) 168.TO BE KEPT JJNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I HAVE been considering the discussion about our Palestine policy which took place in the War Cabinet on the 15th June (see W.P. (G.) (40) 149 (BtegBfc)and War Cabinet Conclusions 167 (40) I^gfpB^ and trying to think of a wayto meet the difficulties of some of those present.It would be possible for our Ambassador in Bagdad to reply to the enquiryaddressed to him by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs by saying that, inthe view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, their previous declarations aboutPalestine were so clear and unambiguous that they saw no reason to add to them.A few days ago this reply might have been sufficient, provided always thatit was clearly understood that, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs then askedwhether this meant that the policy of May 1939 was still in force, the answercould be an unequivocal affirmative.But since then the acceptance of the German armistice terms by France hasmade it more important than ever that we should leave no weak joints in ourarmour in the Middle East. Arab doubt about our Palestine policy is the weakestof all these joints.In these circumstances, I feel compelled to urge that we should speaksubstantially on the lines suggested in paragraph 10 of my memorandum of the12th June, as amended at our meeting of the 15th June.I would, however, be quite willing to make the language somewhat lessprecise in order to meet the difficulties of some of my colleagues, and I therefore suggest that the actual reply to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs should read as follows : &apos;&quot; The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government for Palestine was clearlylaid down in May 1939, and has not been changed. So far as immigration and land sales are concerned, these matters are already being regulated inaccordance with that policy. So far as constitutional development isconcerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government have not so far been able to regardpeace and order as sufficiently restored for the first step to be taken, that isto say, for Palestinians to be appointed to take charge of some of thedepartments of the administration. Nor do they think it likely that this step could be taken while the present war continues. But they hope andexpect that when the war is ended conditions in Palestine will permit thevarious stages of constitutional development to follow one another in orderlysuccession on the lines already laid down.&quot;H.June 26, 1940.11090   [21452]
