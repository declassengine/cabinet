TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be takento ensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.P.(o)(40) 189.22nd JULY, 1940. copY m^..5.3.WAR CABINET.Naval measures proposed to effectContraband Control of the West coast of Europe and North West Africa.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The occupation of Prance has opened the whole Atlantic Coastfrom Ushant to French Morocco for the enemy1 s imports and exports.   Moreover;Spain and Portugal, formerly treated as adjacent neutrals, have now become soin fact.   Accordingly the War Cabinet at the meeting of the 13th July approvein principle that:-(a) The blockade should be applied to the whole westernSeaboard of Europe, and North West Africa.(b) Imports of essential commodities into Spain and portugal should be.rationed.(c) That for the purpose of enforcing this policy it shouldbe made compulsory for any ship approaching the westernseaboard of Europe and North V/est Africa to carry ship&apos;s,   navicerts and that ships with un-navicerted cargo shouldbe treated as blockade-runners to be seized in prize.2. The Naval operations involved in the War Cabinet&apos;s decisionpresent considerable difficulties, owing to the length of the coast to be watched and the lack of convenient bases for our ships.    Gibraltar owing toits lack of fresh water supplies and other reasons will not be suitable as abase so that it will be necessary for our patrols to work from ports in theUnited Kingdom.     In consequence the Naval forces employed on the patrols willhave to be ships of long endurance, i,e. Armed Merchant Cruisers or largeCruisers.3. The number of suitable ships which can be made available isnot large and they will usually be operating at a considerable distance from their &quot;bases.    It follows that our control will be less complete than wecould wish and, in order to make it a sufficient deterrent to blockade running,more drastic measures than sending ships in under armed guard are required.In any case, owing to the distances involved, sending ships in under armed guard would not always be practicable, for example in the case of a ship that has not enough fuel remaining to reach a British port.4. Torninorease the effect of our patrols it is therefore proposedthat a &quot;War Zone&quot; should be declared within which ships without Navicerts willbe liable to be seized or sunk.   Quite apart from the freedom of action thusobtained, it is hoped that the declaration would have a valuable effect as a deterrent to intending blockade - runners.As long as Spain and Portugal are neutral, it is not intendedin fact to adopt a &quot;Sink at Sight&quot; policy but to remove the crew if it is decided to sink the ship.    In practice the decision as to whether to sink orseize would in most cases turn on the value of the ship and cargo to ourselves,and possibly on the number of armed guards remaining available in thepatrol ship.

5. The zone proposed is the area contained within a line drawn2700 from Bishop Rock to longitude 150 W, thence down the meridian of 15Q Wto the latitude of Mogador, thence 090o to the African coast.    The generouswidth of the zone has been arrived at after considering the effective range of German dive bombers, and allowing for the possibility ofmSpain and Portugalbeing involved in the war, since it is not desirable to expose out patrolsunduly to attack from the air.       Moreover, since our ships will be liableto attack from submarines as well as from, aircraft it is advisable to give themplenty of sea room.     Whilst Spain and Portugal are neutral their actualterritorial waters within the 3 mile limit of their coasts would have tobe excluded.S. The substantial result of the above proposals is that within300 miles of the coasts affected blockade -runner s will be liable to be sunk.Ships without Navicerts intercepted outside the zone would be seized in prize.7, In view of the fact that the proposed zone will intersect an area which is not yet within the U.S. combat zone, I suggest that it may be advisable to give the State Department at Washington some prior intimation ofour. intended action, and to suggest that after our declaration has been madethey should increase their combat zone to cover the blockade zone.8* Prom, the date the declaration regarding navicerts is made therewill be an interval before the majority of ships entering the proposed zone canbe expected to carry full navicerts - this is estimated at approximatelya fortnight.    This period will be barely sufficient for the redistribution of our forces to enable the ships required to carry out the patrol in the warwone to be freed from their present duties and take up their new patrolpositions.9. The naval forces engaged in controlling the zone, would, as already stated, usually consist of A.M.C&apos;s. though these may occassionallybe assisted by cruisers or by sweeps by forces stationed at Gibraltar,   But,if the blockade of this large stretch of coast is to be carred outeffectively the key to its success will be good air reconnaissance by long distance flying boats co-operating with our patrols.   No.202 and N*10flying boat squadrons at present based on Gibraltar and Plymouth respectivelyare already fully employed, on anti-submarine duties and cannot be spared for-this purpose and it is essential to obtain without delay as many more long distance flying boats as possible.10. I therefore propose that as soon as the position as regards theU.S.A., Spain and Portugal has been regularised:(a) the declaration proposed by the Ministry of Economic Warfare regardingnavicerts should be ma.de;(b) at the same time a war zone should be declared inside which ships without shapenavicerts would be liable to be seized and according to circumstances sent inor sunk.    This to take effect after an interval of fourteen days;(c) an increase of the number of long distance flying boats should be givenhigh priority.11. Annexed hereto is a memorandum on the Legal issues raised whichwere considered by a Committee under the Chairmanship of the Attorney Generaland including the Legal Advisers of the F.O., N.E.W., and the Procurator general with representatives from the Admiralty.Note. In this paper the zone policy proposed refers to ships withoutnavicerts and thus to inward-bound traffic only.    The important thing atthe moment is to intercept imports, but the Zone policy once declared canreadily be extended to include ships carrying enemy exports, if it is decided to do so.A.V.A.Admiralty, S.W.,1.July, 22nd,1940.

.  &apos; . ANNEX.,,NAVAL MEASURES.- PROPOSED TO EFFECT, CONTRABAND CONTROL&quot;&apos; OF&quot;THE-WEST COAST OF &quot;EUROPE &quot;AND NORTH-WEST AFRICA.&apos;  &apos; Memorandum&quot;on -the legal Issues.The question considered was. whether a policy under which neutral ships with&quot; unnavicerted-cargoes, might be. sunk in the. proposed War Zone-could-be operated;Under- principles .-of. prize Law or a reasonableextension of them.   In the case of enemy -merchant vessels the rule hasbeen that they should only be sunk or destroyed in exceptional circum-stancesj and the British view in the past has been that there was neverany justification for destroying a neutral vessel, and if this were donefull indemnities &quot;should be paid although it ,mightrbe quite., clear, thatvessel and cargo would have been subject -to condemnation if put intoPrize.    Other nations did not take this view, and the declaration ofLondon proposed to settle the matter by a compromise under which thedestruction of a captured neutral, vessel which would have been liable tocondemnation was justified if the taking of the vessel into port would have involved danger to the safety of the capturing cruiser or to the successof the operations in which she was at the time of the capture engaged.This of course assumed that provision would be made for the safety ofthe crew.In spite of the British view referred to, it is thought that inthe altered conditions of to-day our own Prize Court might well adopt theDeclaration of London compromise, and possibly might go further.    It is however clear that a claim to sink in a War Zone irrespective of circum-stances could not be justified under existing principles or any admissableextension of them.    If therefore a policy was announced that ships withoutnavicerts would be liable to be sunk, or would be liable to be sent in orsunk, this would be taken as meaning that on grounds of policy theGovernment were proposing to take action outside recognised principles ofinternational law.    If on the other hand the policy was expressed in some/ such
such words as, that ships without navioerts would be liable afterseizure to be sent in or sunk according to circumstances, this wouldnot necessarily involve act:.ng outside international law.    It was understood that the proposal to be submitted to the War Cabinet would include words of this kind.    The question whether there was a reason-able chance of getting the Prize Court to treat any particularsinking as justified would have to be considered in the light of thecircumstances.    It seems possible that under the conditions of modernwarfare even the somewhat limited right proposed in the Declarationof London might cover at any rate a good many of the cases in whichsinking might be ,necessary.Admiralty, S.W. 1.22nd July, 1940.
