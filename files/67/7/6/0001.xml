9J, C R E TotLP.f G)(40) 156.TSTH JUNE,  1940, COPY NO,     i 3FRENCH COLONIAL TERRITORIES AND ECONOMIC PRESSURE.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Economic Warfare.I have considered recommendation (d), paragraph 30 oiWoPo  (40)207 dated 15th June and have examined the economic!-gpsition of the principal groups of French colonial possessions and the problem of applying economic pressure to them, in the event of their refusing ,rin- a certaineventuality&quot; to co-operate with us in denying supplies tothe enemy.A study of trade statistics shows that the preventionof imports into these Colonial territories is not likely toproduce quick results.      On the other hand, the populations ofthese territories are almost completely dependent upon their capacity to sell their exports.     A stoppage of their outwardtrade would, therefore, lead rapidly to internal difficulties and to the embarrassment of the European civilian populationsand administrative officers.In order, therefore, to exert effective economic pressure we must take steps to obstruct the sale of exports from these Colonies.      It would, no doubt, also be desirable,though less essential to stop their imports.     More promising,perhaps, than either, would be to make an offer of constructiveaid to the local administrators in conducting the affairs ofthe colonies.     This offer should comprise(l) a guarantee of the solvency of the local administra-tion and the liquidity of its banking system,(2) the supply to the European administrative officersof small quantities of essential stores, such as spare partsfor automobiles, lubricants, clothing, small arms ammunition,possibly a few machine.guns, specialised&quot;foodstuffs and othercomforts, and generally such apparatus as may be required tomaintain for a short period the prestige and power of theEuropean populations.The quantities required under (2) would not be large.Such an economic inducement might well be more effective than coercion.I notice that no reference is made in the paper under reference to the French Mercantile Marine including ex-neutral shipping chartered to the French.      It will be of the utmost importance to bring under our control as many of these shipsas possible      I have ascertained that the Ministry of shipping have this matter under consideration.      I also understand thatit is their view, which I share, that this control could more easily be maintained, if it could be administered by are recognised French governmental authority, even if this wasnot resident in France.

Our success in maintaining control of the french colonial, territories interlocks with the problem of the dutch and Belgian colonies,.      I am advised that, for the effectivemaintenance of economic pressure upon Germany, it will benecessary to permit no breach in any system of joint economiccontrol that may be set up.      I am meeting representatives ofthe French^ Belgian and Netherlands Empires tomorrow morning,June 17th to discuss the general problem of controlling at the source the products of the Allied EmpireSc      This question will not be discussed on the assumption of the collapse of theFrench European Government.      I hope that both from tomorrow&apos;smeeting, and from a meeting of experts fixed for the next day,valuable information and practical suggestions will emergeo(Intd. )     H, DoMinistry of Economic Warfare.
