7 c, u.Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1940.SECEET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 151.June 15, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of. this document.WAR CABINET.TRADE WITH KIRKENES AND PETSAMO.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a memorandum on the subjectof the shipment of iron, ore from Kirkenes and of steel from Petsamo.H.Foreign Office, June 15, 1940.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs and theMinister of Supply.BEFORE the Norwegian war, we obtained from Norway and Sweden variousmetals and metal ores which are of great importance to our armament industry.There is a chance that we shall be able to obtain and ship to this countryimportant quantities of these materials now, if we act quickly. In a short time,when the Germans have established themselves securely in North Norway, weshall of course be completely cut off from this source of supply. We should liketo suggest, therefore, for the consideration of our colleagues, that a strenuouseffort should be made at once, before it is too late, to remove what we can fromKirkenes in Norway and the Finnish port of Petsamo, which is now our onlyoutlet for our trade with Sweden. There are also in Sweden some British navaland air force personnel who might perhaps be brought to this country, if arrangements can be made to send ships to fetch the material from Kirkenes andPetsamo.Kirkenes.In the first place, there is at Kirkenes a stock of about 250,000 tons of iron ore from the Sydvaranger Mines, which is ready for shipment. This ore is ofthe very highest quality, better even than our own very small supplies ofCumberland ore.The stocks at Kirkenes consists of briquettes and concentrates. Apart fromtheir great value to us, these stocks would be of great value to the Germans, who do not possess anything comparable.Our most urgent requirement is for briquettes, of which there are in allabout 85,000 tons ready for shipment at Kirkenes.   These briquettes can, beloaded from one quay only, which has a capacity for loading about 2,500 tons aday.   This means that three 5,000-ton cargoes could be loaded inside a week.11065   [21408]
The sort of scheme which might be feasible would be for three ships to besent to Kirkenes under naval escort, in the hope that all, or some of them, couldbe loaded before the Germans occupy Kirkenes.We have no official information about what has happened to North Norwaysince the withdrawal, but a report was published in the Press on the 14th ist .to the effect that there are no Germans in North Norway beyond Narvik.Meanwhile, His Majesty&apos;s Ministers at Stockholm and Helsingfors have beenasked to find out all they can as regards the situation in Northern Norway, withspecial reference to Kirkenes. It may be found that the Germans have alreadyoccupied Kirkenes from the air, and that it is useless to consider sending anyships to Kirkenes. Until, however, we have definite news that Kirkenes is inGerman hands, we think we should continue to investigate the possibility of sending three ships to fetch the ore. The German occupation of Kirkenes cannot in any case be long delayed, and the need for speed is very great.We suggest therefore that a meeting of representatives of the Foreign Office,Ministry of Supply, Admiralty, Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of economic warfare should be summoned urgently to consider this question.Petsamo.We understand that arrangements have been made for certain urgently required steel products to be transported by road to Petsamo for shipment to thiscountry. Some of these steels, comparatively small in bulk, are of the very first importance in the near future for our aircraft production, to bridge a gap beforesupplies on order arrive from America. (These special steels have to be constructed to specifications and orders for them must be given with a minimum of 12 weeks&apos; notice.)Of these special steels, 300 to 400 tons of tube hollows are now ready for shipment, and 1,000 tons of wire rods are either ready how or will be ready for shipment within a few days. In all, the Ministry of Supply require, and arearranging to have transported to Petsamo within the next six weeks, 3,000 tonsof Swedish special steels. (There are other quantities 2,000 tons of bar-ironand 10,000 tons of charcoal pig-iron which it is highly desirable to obtain inthe near future; but this is a question which would have to be considered later.)We understand that a Swedish ship, the Goteborg, has already left thiscountry for Petsamo with goods for Sweden and is expected to arrive in three or four days&apos; time; the intention is that it should return forthwith with a cargo of Swedish products for the United Kingdom, especially special steels. Further,it is expected that a Finnish boat will leave Petsamo early in July with a cargofor this country, and arrangements are being made for this ship to bring further supplies of Swedish steels.In present circumstances, and in view of the very great importance of the cargo which these ships coming from Petsamo will carry, it is obviously most desirable that the ships should be given adequate naval protection, at least ontheir return journey to this country. * Even if the Germans are in effective control of Kirkenes, there is a very good chance that naval protection for these ships can be effective; for the Germans will probably not be willing to violateFinnish neutrality by intercepting the boats in Finnish waters, and outside thelimit of Finnish territorial waters a British destroyer or two would no doubt beable to cope with the small naval craft, which is probably all that the germans will be able to put into Kirkenes in the near future. We suggest, therefore, thatthe Admiralty should investigate urgently&apos; the possibility of providing a navalescort for these vessels.Naval and Aircraft Personnel in Sweden.There are at present in Stockholm 43 men from H.M.S. Hunter and32 aircraft technicians sent out by the Air Ministry during the Finnish war to assemble the aeroplanes which we were then supplying to the Finns. There isa possibility of removing these men on a Finnish ship which is due to leavePetsamo on the 15th June; but it seems likely that the men will not be ableto reach Petsamo in time to take passage on the ship. If they fail to arrive in time, the possibility of finding them accommodation on one of the ships whichit is hoped to send to Petsamo to fetch the special steels, should be borne in mind.
Summary.To sum up, we would suggest:  (1) that the possibility of sending, say, three ships to Kirkenes, with adequatenaval protection, to fetch as much of the iron-ore as possible, shouldbe urgently investigated.(2) that a naval escort should be provided for the two or three ships which,it is hoped, will be bringing from Petsamo the Swedish special steelswhich are of vital importance to our aircraft production.(3) that the possibility of bringing the naval and air force personnel, whoare at present in Sweden, on one of the ships calling at Petsamo shouldbe borne in mind.H.H. S. M.June 15, 1940.
