COPY NOPrivy Council Office, S.W.1.11TTI JULY,      1940.SECRET.f.P.(G)(40)  182.11TH JULY, 1940.&quot;7AR    CABINETEVACUATION OP CHILDREN OVERSEAS., Note &quot;by the Lord President of the Council.I circulate for the considerationof the War Cabinet a re-draft of the proposedQuestion   and Answer   regarding the ChildrensOverseas Reception Scheme,(Intld.) N.G.

Question; To ask the Lord Priv^ Seal whether he can:   &apos;   give any further information about the progressof the Children!s Overseas Reception Scheme.Answer^      Yes Sir0      The House has already been made aware of the extremely generous offers for the reception andma inter.:.avR3 of British children during the war that havebeen ma b from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and theUnion o  South Africa, and also from the United   Statesof America,,      These offers were already sufficient to account for a very substantial number of the children for whom applications have been made under the government scheme, and I have no doubt that they by no means indicate the limit of the accommodation which might ultimately bemade available overseas,In carrying out this Scheme, the Governmentwould have no difficulty in providing the shippingrequired, as there is ample tonnage available.     On theother hand, the Government feel strongly the responsibilitythat rests upon them to see that any children who gooverseas under the Governraent Scheme should have suchnaval protection as would reasonably ensure the safety oftheir passage during the voyage.      The fate of the ArandoraStar shows that even a fast passenger vessel can trust to nothing but her own speed if she is unescorted.Unfortunately it is in present circumstancesossential to concentrate our whole naval forces on thetask of meeting the overriding demands of national security.It is this consideration alone virhich has forced theGovernment reluctantly to the conclusion that they mustpostpone the operation of the scheme for the transference of children overseas until the situation at sea enables them to provide naval escort for the ships employed forthis purpose.Ordinary fast passenger vessels are not escortedand if children are carried on such vessels outside any government scheme the responsibility for any risks on the voyage would not be on the Government.The Government realise that the postponement oftheir scheme, although inevitable,  is bound to cause great disappointment among parents here, and also amongst thosewho in Canada and the other Dominions have so wholeheartedlyco-operated in making preparations for the reception of thechildren,      I desire to assure tham that Y/e deeplyappreciate their generosity, and earnestly trust that the postponement of our scheme will not cause them undueinconveni enc e aTo those in the United States of America whohave also spared no effort to find a comfortable temporaryhome for British children, I would like also to expresson behalf of His Majestyfs Government our warmest thanks.I hope that our scheme is only temporarily suspended andthat we may yet be able to make use of that warmheartedhospitality so spontaneously and readily offered us.
