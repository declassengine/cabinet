PUBLICATION OP MERCHANT SHIPPING LOSSES.Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping.At their meeting on the 8th July, the war Cabinet were agreed inprinciple that the publication of weekly figures of sinkings of merchant ships through enemy action should cease as soon as favourable results hadbeen shown for a week or two.Before this decision is made operative, I should be glad if thefollowing considerations could be taken into account.The public are very conscious of the fact that in the last war theshipping position became so serious as to threaten defeat, and they areto-day. correspondingly sensitive to the shipping situation.     It is therefor&apos;-of the first importance to keep the public confident that the shipping position is sufficiently revealed to them.We have now published the numbers and tonnage of losses by enemy acti,week by week for 43 successive weeks.     The general ground for this policy has been that, if the public knew that they were being given up-to-date and .accurate figures and were being told the truth, they would not feel alarmedor depressed by exaggerated or inaccurate information published or broadcastby the enemy himself.     Even though we discontinue publication at a fav&amp;torablemoment when losses have been much reduced, the impression might later be created, as a result of certain losses becoming known, that our losses hadbecame so large as to be embarrassing.     Moreover, it might be assumed thatthe enemy&apos;s command of the French coast had led to such increases in curshipping losses that we are afraid to disclose them.Much as I regret the severity of the recent losses and greatly as Ih*pe that it will be possible to restore without delay the necessaryescorts to give greater security to shipping approaching this country,the situation is not one which we need shrink from exposing frankly.The gross losses of British tonnage over 500 gross tons as a result of enemy action from the outbreak of the war up to 7th July were 1,180,000gross tons.     In addition, losses from marine casualties and other causesamounted to 267,000 tons, making a;total of 1,447,000 tons.     against these losses we had constructed 642,000 tons of new tonnage.     We had captured 279,000 tons of German and Italian ships, and 296,000 tons of danish shipping had been seized and transferred to our flag.     As aresult sf other transfers of flag, purchase, etc., we had added to ourMercantile Marine 486,000 tons, making total additions nf 1,703,000 tons.There was thus up to the 7th July a net gain of over 200,000 gross tonsof shipping at our command.     It is true that in the five weeks ended7th July the rate of loss was severe, although owing mainly to the capture of Italian and the transfer of Danish vessels, the losses in thisperiod were more than made good.     The gross losses through enemy action were 329,000 tons and through other causes 19,000 tons.I do not suggest that we should announce the losses of particularships as they occur, but it must be remembered that the sinkings ofparticular ships, even when not directly observed by the enemy, are knownto- a large number of persons, including owners, crews, underwriters andIjfjhr40) 190 WAR    CABINET.

the inhabitants of our ports;   furthermore some losses occur in waterswhere neutral countries become aware of the circumstances.    The factthat ao many of the losses are known in detail to so many personsincreases my doubts as to the wisdom of concealing the aggregate losses from the general public.I de not press for the continuation of weekly publication iffortnightly or oven monthly is preferred, and I should see littleobjection, to the statements being confined to net losses (or gains)after allowing for new building, etc.     I would, however, suggest forthe consideration of the War Cabinet that the precise form in which shipping losses or gains should be published might be settled betweenthe First L*rd of the Admiralty, the Minister of Information and myself.It would, of course, be neoessary to take into account the need to avoiddisclosing certain information to the enemy, and for this purpose itmight be desirable to present the figures in  in indirect manner, and alsoto recommend the supression of press publication of individual losses.In my opinion, a policy of frankness about our losses, accompaniedby frequent reminders of our basic strength, would prevent the growth ofalarming rumours or exaggerated impressions and have a reassuring effectn**t only at home but in other countries.R.H.C.MINISTRY OP SHIPPING.18th July, 1940.
