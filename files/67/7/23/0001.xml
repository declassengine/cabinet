: i.....   88This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment.SECRET--y.p.(G)(ho) 1736th July, 19hQ.war cabinet .india and the war.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.Copy No.AThe War Cabinet will be aware of the basic facts ofthe present political situation in India.    They centre round the attitude of the Congress on the one hand and the moslem league on the other to the question of support for theBritish Government in the war.    Shortly after the outbreakof war the Congress -Torking Committee defined their positionand have re-defined it on several subsequent occasions.    the gist of these pronouncements is that India cannot be expectedto co-operate in the war except on a basis of freedom;    that,unlike all the Dominions, she was dragged into the positionof a belligerent with no opportunity of expressing heropinion for or against belligerency;    that the BritishGovernment purports to be fighting to uphold, amongst other things, freedom and democracy but refuses freedom anddemocracy to India;    that the Congress will considerco-operation only if India is forthwith declared to be entirely independent, and free to determine her own destiny,to settle herself whether her future is to lie inside or outside the orbit of the British Empire and to frame her ownself-governing Constitution without interference by anyoutside power and with the aid of a Constituent Assemblyelected by adult suffrage.    Finally the Congress at firstpersistently maintained, though this claim has perfroceconsiderably abated in the course of the dispute, that inmaking these demands it was voicing the desires and opinions of the whole of India.    Congress is undoubtedly the largestand best organised political body in India, but there arelarge sections even among Hindus such as the Mahasabha andthe Scheduled Castes, not to speak of the influential thoughill-organised National Liberal Federation, which reject i^authority,    in any case the Moslem League emphaticallyrepudiates the all-India pretensions of the Congress whoseauthority to speak for all but an infinitesimal and whollyunrepresentative fraction of the Moslem community it denies.The League claims to be the only recognised mouthpiece ofthe Moslems of British India and demands as the&apos;price ofthe whole-hearted support of the Indian Moslems a clearassurance amongst other things that no change in theConstitution will be brought about and no statement madeforeshadowing such a change which has not behind it thewilling assent of the Moslem community.2.    In October last the Governor-General put out a longstatement in reply to these conflicting claims.    The concreteproposals which he offered in response to them, supplementedas the result of a debate a few days after the publication- ofhis statement in the House of Commons, were -

(1) Reaffirmation of the policy of the British Governmentfor India as that of Dominion status at the earliestpossible date;(2) in recognition of the fact that the Federal provisionsof the Act of 1935 had met with universal criticismin India and were not likely to be implemented as they stood, a promise of reconsideration .of the whole Actat the end of the w^r in consultation with representative Indians with a view to considering on what lines its alteration was desirable;(3) Meanwhile, with a view to affording Indians an opportunityfor more active association in India&apos;s war effort, he proposed, first,  that a Consultative Committee shouldbe set up to be called together at intervals underthe chairmanship of the Governor-General himself todiscuss war happenings and policy, and secondly, thatthe Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council should be expanded so as to admit into its ranks and thus intothe inner counsels of the Central government representative Indian policians of both communities.These proposals were flatly rejected by the Congressas a derisory failure to meet their demands, and the congress ministries in seven Provinces were thereupon instructed todemit office - an instruction with which in many cases theycomplied with great reluctance.    The position is, therefore,that since the beginning of November last, while responsible government under Moslem Premiers remains in force in theProvinces of Bengal, the Punjab, Sind and Assam,  in theremaining Provinces the government has been carried on for thelast eight months by the Governors acting under the special provisions of s.93 of the Act, which enabled them to assumeall the powers of government into their own hands if a situation arose when the government could not be carried onin accordance with the provisions of the Act.    Such a situation necessarily arose in every Province where theParty in possession of the majority in the provincialLegislature was the Congress with the result that it wouldhave been impossible for any Ministry of another complexionto command the necessary political support.3*    While this political crisis was looming,  it had beenconfidently anticipated that an almost inevitable result ofthe resignation of the Congress Ministries,  if they didresign, would be resort by the Congress to civil disobedienceon a widespread scale.    These anticipations have so far been completely falsified, and Mr.Gandhi&apos;s influence has hithertosucceeded in restraining the Left Wing and revolutionaryelement in the Congress who have been throughout anxious to urge the Congress into a course of direct action.    IndeedMr.Gandhi&apos;s action in this respect has brought about adefinite split within the Congress ranks and the creationof the so-called &quot;Forward Bloc&quot; under the leadership ofSubhas Bose who was not long ago himself President of theCongress.    Various reasons have contributed to the abstentionfrom resort to civil disobedience, which still remains inthe background as the chief weapon in the official Congressarmoury to be resorted to at the appropriate time.    But thereis little doubt that the influence which has been most effective has been the consciousness that the Moslems wouldnot merely take no part in civil disobedience, but wouldactively oppose it, and that the situation would rapidly

develop into one of acute communal disturbances bordering on civil war.   Meanwhile the administration of the seven&quot;Congress&quot; provinces has been proceeding entirely smoothlyunder the administration of the Governors assisted in eachcase by a small body of official advisers, and the reversionfrom Congress rule to impartial bureaucratic administration has met with no opposition in the Provinces concerned, andhas been warmly-welcomed by the MoslemB amongst whom Mr.Jinnah(as President of the Moslem League)  organised in december last a day of national rejoicing at the extinction of congress rule.Under the provisions of the Act a Proclamation unders*33 cannot last for longer than six months without theapproval of both Houses of Parliament.    The necessary approvalwas given to the inevitable extension after debate in bothHouses in April last.h.    But, although from the point of view of the Indianpeasant there is no doubt much to be said for the continuanceof the present system of administration over a large part ofIndia,  the indefinite continuance of the present politicaldeadlock in India obviously cannot be contemplated withequanimity.    At present there is no immediate sign of an outbreak of lawlessness, but that there are dangers in thepresent situation cannot be denied.    There is the negativedanger of the absence of any real and concerted nationaleffort in India to aid the defence of Great Britain or tofurther the defence of India herself, though the necessityfor the latter has been increasingly borne in on Indians bythe events of the last few weeks;    and there is widespreaddisquiet not only on the part of European residents,.,but amongst all sections of the loyal and moderate elementsat the ineffectiveness of India&apos;s war effort.    On the positive side, the estrangement between the Hindu and Moslemcommunities has reached serious proportions.    It was greatlyaccentuated when the Moslem League in March, in answer to theofficial reaffirmation by Congress of its policy at theRamgarh session, produced as their solution for India&apos;future a proposal for Partition, on the ground that it wouldnot be possible for the Moslem and Hindu &quot;nations&quot; to live inpeace side by side in a self-governing State.    In twoProvinces a militant Moslem volunteer organisation under thename of Khaksars has given considerable trouble to theauthorities and shown much organised truculence, while thelatest resolution of the Congress Working Committee, in which mr.Gandhi&apos;s doctrine of non-violence was rejected asinapplicable to external aggression, indicated thepossibility of attempts by the Congress to set up defenceorganisations of its own.    This manifesto was no doubtintended to a large extent as an answer to the widespreaddemands which the events of the past few weeks have evoked inIndia for a rally in support of Great Britain in herextremity.    But, though there exists at present such a desire to assist, we can have no assurance that, if wefail to take advantage of it,,it might not turn to a feeling that Britain&apos;s difficulties are India&apos;s opportunities.5*    While the offer of last autumn described in paragraph   2   was in effect reaffirmed both by LordZetland in April and by myself a month later, the Governor-General has hitherto felt - especially after an abortiveconversation with Mr.Gandhi in February - that the time wasnot ripe for a renewal of his own initiative and that the

right course for him was to lie back until he could feelmore certain that his ini.tia.tlve was both necessary and likely to lead to results.    in his opinion intervention hasalways been a matter of correct timing.    He has now, however,come to the conclusion, as will be seen from his telegramattached (Appendix A)  that a policy of inaction in presentcircumstances is no longer defensible and that the state ofpublic opinion in India offers a better prospect of successthan at any time during the last eight months.    The Governor-General has, therefore, been tentatively exploring withMr.Gandhi and Mr.Jinnah in conversations held with each ofthem separately last week - to be followed by conversations with other Indian political leaders -* the extent of the support which, in present conditions, would be likely to be forthcomingif he were now formally to renew his offer of political aopaint-ments to his Executive-Council:    this night be with or withouta separate consultative ,,&apos;ar Council and wit2a or without am?a?ge-ments for reaumption-of -office by Congress in the Provinces.6.    The question which inevitably presented itself inthis connexion was whether the renewal of the offer shouldnot be accompanied by some statement of our intentions as to future constitutional developments which should be more precise, both as to the method   of approach and as to date,than the far-reaching but vague generalities of previousdeclarations.    Such a statement has been continuously pressed for not only by sympathisers with the Congress point of view,but by moderate leaders of Indian opinion who have felt thatsome constructive answer to Congress was essential.    It was with these considerations in mind that the Governor-General,in discussing matters with Mr.Gandhi and Mr.Jinnah, felt itnecessary to indicate very tentatively and without in anyway committing His Majesty&apos;s Government, his suggestions asto the kind of form which such a statement, if made, might take.7-    Mr.Jinnah was anxious to bring the Moslem Leagueinto the expanded Executive Council and was confident that,if the Congress were to decline (which he clearly expected and hoped), no difficulty would be found in securingrepresentatives of other important elements in indian political life to accept seats along with the Moslems.    he further urged, again on the assumption of Congress refusal,that the official advisers now employed by the Governors inthe &quot;Congress&quot; provinces should be replaced by non-officials,his idea being that, if this were done, the non-officialsso selected would in due course manage to secure sufficient support amongst the members of the respective provincial legislatures to enable them to claim office as Ministers inthe ordinary way.    Mr.jinnah has, however, followed up his conversation with the Governor-General with a letter, thepurpose of which was to stake out demands which would beobviously unacceptable.    His claim was for 50/50 representationof Moslems and Congress Hindus if the Congress joined in,and a Moslem majority if they did not, this claim being madewith reference not only to the Governor-General&apos;s ExecutiveCouncil but also to the proposed War consultative committee.   He claimed again a majority of the provincialadvisers, and the nomination of Moslems for all three bodiesto vest in the Moslem League.    It seems possible, therefore,that Mr.Jinnah may be playing primarily for his own hand and thathis personal cooperation may not in the end be, secured.    but even so the Governor-General feels confident that hisdefection would still leave an important volume of Moslemsupport for his offer.

Mr.Gandhi admitted that, if the Governor-General were tomake an endeavour to get all-Party co-operation and his efforts did not take a form which had the appearance of an endeavour to &quot;smash the Congress&quot; the result might hesalutary.    But he was quite uncompromising, both in his interview and in a subsequent communication to theGovernor-General, in his assertion that no declaration suchas that outlined to him tentatively by the Governor-General,and indeed nothing short of a complete acceptance of their demands, would induce the Congress to co-operate.    Indeed,Mr.Gandhi expressed the strongest opposition to any such statement as that which was outlined to him, and I drawspecial attention to this fact as clearly indicating, in my view that he realised at once how dangerous it might be forCongress, both in the eyes of the public and from the pointof view of its own internal unity, to be placed in theposition of refusing so reasonable an offer.8.    Personally I have no doubt that a declaration ofour future intentions, as far-reaching and as precise as wecan make it, is essential to the success of the Governor-General^ initiative, and indeed I should be definitelyopposed to his taking the initiative unless he were in aposition, through such a declaration, to endeavour to securethe general support of public opinion in India, European aswell as Indian, for the broadened Central Executive, and,assuming that we cannot secure the support of Congress, totake the sting out of its opposition.    Our declarationshitherto could not have been more sweeping in their generalpurport.    &quot;Dominion status of the Statute of Westminstervariety&quot; - the expression used in a speech by the Governor-General in January - implies complete independence,including the now admitted right of a free decision as to participation or neutrality in war, and indeed the power, ifnot the constitutional right, to secede.    On the other hand,so long as we indicate neither date nor method, we remain open to the charge that we are insincere and are merelyplaying for time, and until we do so our exhortations to indians to agree amongst themselves meet with no responseand only add to the suspicion that we are deliberatelypro era s t ina t ing.9.    The question is what can we concede or make clear in this respect?    One thing which I think we can concedeis the right of Indians themselves to frame their ownConstitution so far as it affects India alone.    That is thecore of what is reasonable in the Congress demand and is,indeed, the natural corollary of our own pledges.    Thepresent Constitution has been in the main our handiwork;it is influenced by the past bureaucratic organisation ofIndia as well as by our own political ideas, and isresented as something foreign imposed upon India fromwithout.    It may well be that if left with a completelyfree hand Indians, having exhausted the search foralternatives, would largely fall back upon the present constitution.    Or they may; again, devise something moresuited to their own conditions.    But why should we make this a concern of ours?10.    What does concern us are the obligations which our long connexion with India has imposed on us, and I feelconvinced that there would be a reasonable chance of gettingadequate provision for these willingly adopted by India if,instead of being imposed upon her,  they were in terms, at all

events, agreed as the result of negotiation leading to atreaty.    This would in fact be no more than a restatement ofmy predecessor&apos;s assertion that our promise to review theConstitution at the end of the war implied negotiation andnot dictation.    After all, so many of the difficulties inour contacts with Indians are psychological.    The Indianattitude is always liable to be coloured by an inferioritycomplex and it -is this which gives to questions of form and status an importance which it would be a grave mistake to disregard.11.    On the other hand we are entitled, and indeedbound,  to resist the Congress claim that the instrument forframing the new Constitution should be an amorphous Assemblyselected by the vote of the whole adult population of India.If India were homogeneous, or if the Congress could trulybe said to represent even a reasonable proportion of all themain elements in the population,  its claim to whatever formof Assembly it desired to frame its Constitution could notwell be refused.    But we obviously cannot stand for an assembly which would be hoycotted by the minorities and whose decisions could only be enforced by British bayonets.This is why we must still insist on Indian agreement.    Butagreement with a definite programme in sight and a more orless definite date for its commencement - and I lay stress on the reference in my proposed statement to &quot;immediatelyafter the war&quot; as the date for convening the constituentbody - is at any rate more attainable.    Here too no doubtwe should have to give a lead.    But if we can getrepresentatives of both communities to work together on theGovernor-General1s Executive Council that in itself will have gone a long way towards paving the way for such agreement,and indeed it may be possible for the Governor-General topromote ideas amongst his new colleagues which would lead tothe setting up of some small preliminary informal andobjective inquiry which I myself should regard as almostessential to effective progress towards agreement.12.   Any conception of self-government and of the meansof approach to it such as that contained in Appendix Braises difficult questions not only as to the place of theIndian States in a &quot;Dominion of India&quot;, but also as to their position in relation to the discussions leading to itscreation and as to the adjustment of our existing obligations to them.    It will suffice for present purposes to say that Ishould regard it as essential that the Constitution to be devised for a self-governing India should be one which wouldaim at embracing the whole country, and accordingly thatit is highly desirable on general grounds as well as in theinterests of the States themselves that the States shouldbe represented in the constituent body, and in any preliminaryinquiry leading up to it.    But while there is everything tobe said for including States&apos; representatives on theproposed War Council I see no reason to press for including a prince or a Dewan amongst the &quot;political&apos;1&apos; members of theGovernor-General&apos;s Executive Council.13*    I should like to emphasise that, as the Congresscase as outlined in the first paragraph of this memorandum is susceptible of very effective presentation in America,and Congress propagandists have been active in that country where they have found a sympathetic field, I feel no lessstrongly than my predecessor that, if we were faced withactive opposition by the Congress in India which would of necessity have to be met by repressive measures, we should find it difficult to justify our position before public

opinion whether at home or abroad if we had failed to clarify our intentions as I have suggested.    Whether,therefore,  the Congress chooses to co-operate or loses groundwith its own supporters or, as may still conceivably happen,has to be fought outright, we should be in a far better position to face the situation if we had defined our policyin some such terms as I suggest than if we maintain theposition as it has stood hitherto in this respect thatcomplete self-government is the acknowledged goal for Indiabut that we decline to give any indication of when or how itis to be brought about.1b..    The recommendation I, therefore, make to theCabinet, a recommendation resulting from Lord LinlithgowTsinitiative, is that His Majesty&apos;s Government should now issue a declaration of our intentions in the terms of the draft which is attached to this Memorandum as Appendix B.    Ibelieve we have everything to gain, in India and outside,by making this declaration.    There is nothing in it that isnot already implicit in our previous pledges.    What itdoes is, by giving precision to the method of implementingthose pledges, to remove the otherwise ineradicable suspicion of Indians and others that we have not really meant what wehave said.    And we should make it now.    As the Governor-general has pointed out &quot;speed is of the essence of the business&quot;.    Thepresent moment is as favourable in India as it is ever likelyto be, and the situation may easily deteriorate beyondpossibility of remedy.    Nor can we afford to ignore theimportance of the present moment in its bearing on world opinion, mox^e particularly in America.    That both India and america should feel able to endorse our cause whole-heartedlyand without reservation may go far to make up for defectionselsewhere.15*    If the War Cabinet approve my proposed declaration,I should propose to announce it in the House of commons at an early date in answer to a Question and to arrange withthe Governor-General that he should publish it simultaneously in India with such matter of his own as he consideredappropriate, possibly in the form of a public appeal for aunification of war effort behind the leadership of the enlarged Executive Council and of the new War Committee.    Ianticipate with some confidence that the result will be aresponse from the whole of political India except,  in all probability,  the official leaders of the Congress Party,and with the possible exception also of Mr.Jinnah and such his followers in the Moslem League as elect to stand byhim if he should unexpectedly prove intransigent.    Whetheror not any early resolution of the deadlock in the provincesproves feasible must,  I think, depend upon developments;but I should not be without hope that if there is a cleavagein the Congress ranks which leaves the doctrinaire leadershigh and dry, there may be sufficient eagerness amongst the rank and file to get back to power in the Provinces to make them amenable to the idea of sharing office there also withthe Moslems:    it is evident that on no other- condition would the Moslems be prepared to acquiesce in a return to power by congress Ministries in the Provinces.L. C. A.t OFFICE:,6th July, 19u1.

APPENDIX A.Telegram from Governor-General, dated July 1, 1940.1187-S. Secret. I have telegraphed separately gist of my talks with gandhi and Jinnah. I have also sent you an analysis of party position here as i see it at the moment. We have now to consider what is next step to be&apos; taken insituation revealed.2. Broadly speaking, position that confronts us is one in which moslem league are anxious to lend full co-operation in war, but from inside theAdministration, and in which they are prepared to co-operate by joining my council if expanded on lines indicated with approval of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment last November by inclusion of a small number of political leaders. Jinnahclaims that Mahasabha, Ambedkar representing Scheduled Castes, Tara Singh,and probably an important forward block element, share his view, and would beprepared to come into such expanded council. (I have no reason to doubt him,but must, of course, take steps to check accuracy of what he says.) Congress, onthe other hand, to judge from Gandhi&apos;s conversation (and I have no reason tobelieve the Working Committee will be more accommodating than Gandhi), willnot be prepared to take any part or share in a Central Government expandedon lines under discussion unless full Congress claim for complete independenceis first conceded. Gandhi has rejected my tentative suggestion for an amendeddeclaration so generously framed that I quite realise that the Cabinet may feelthat I have gone further than they would wish in sounding him on it even on the tentative and personal basis I adopted. Equally, he is averse from any form ofexploratory machinery such as you and I have tentatively mentioned in our owncorrespondence. Finally, so far as can be judged by any formal documentsavailable to us (e.g., the resolutions passed by Congress and Moslem League atWardha and Bombay respectively on 21st and 16th June), the clash of out lookand of intention between Congress and Moslem League remains as grave andunbridgeable as ever.3. We must now consider what the next step should be.&apos; Let me say, in thefirst place, that I am quite clear in my own mind that the point has been reached in the prosecution of the war at which it is unsound and unsatisfactory, and likely to prove increasingly difficult in terms of public reaction, that we shouldcontinue at Centre to handle the matter through an entirely bureaucraticGovernment. At the same time I do not contemplate, and would not recommend,that responsibility of the Government of India to the Secretary of State and.Parliament should in any way be diminished at this point. Whatever changesmay be made in the composition of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council, Ithink it essential that the existing responsibility to the Home Government andthe Secretary of State&apos;s existing powers of superintendence, direction and control should be maintained.4. The position cannot be considered solely in terms of the Centre. Jinnahhas made it clear that he thinks it only proper that, if there is an expansion inthe Centre such as he suggests, and if Congress are not prepared to co-operateeither there or in the Provinces, there should be some corresponding association in the Provinces of non-official advisers belonging to political parties represented at the Centre (in cases, presumably, in which those parties are an element ofimportance in the Province concerned) with Section 93 administrations, and hehas not concealed his hope that those political non-official advisers would be ableto turn their appointment to advantage to bring about in due course a situationin which they or the parties they represent might be able to offer the Governorsconcerned a working majority ,in the Legislature and so admit of a return to normal Parliamentary Government, even if Congress still refuse to co-operate.5. Given this conflict of view between the two main political organisations,we have to consider whether, if Congress still refuse to co-operate in an expandedCentre, save on terms which we cannot accept, the risks involved in expandingmy Council to include representatives of Moslem League, the Mahasabha, the scheduled Castes, possibly the Sikhs, and of forward block, are so great as to rule that proposition out of court. The dangers in question are of course that congress, finding itself (even though through its own fault) left out in the cold,[21474]
may abandon the policy of not too unfriendly criticism which it has so faradopted; that there may be attempts at civil disobedience; and that there wouldcertainly be a marked exacerbation of feeling between Congress followers andelements adhering to organisations to be included in expanded council. Such astate of things might of course have an unfortunate effect on our war effort, mightnecessitate the immobilisation of the bodies of troops required elsewhere, andmight afford material for hostile enemy propaganda. We have also to consider(a substantial point) so far as Provinces are concerned that any arrangement for&apos;political non-official advisers of the nature indicated by Jinnah would be calculated to work up political feeling materially, and would bring Section 93administrations into the political field and associate them to a greater or lessextent with activities of certain political parties. Congress might even think it worth endeavouring to interfere with it by abandoning them to isolation andoffering to resume office in the Provinces. If they would undertake to do so andco-operate in prosecution of the war of the West, well and good. If they refusedto give such undertaking, they could not be allowed to hold office. In any event,there would be the risk also of trouble between Congress and Moslems if congress were to return before some understanding with Moslems had been reached.6. As regards the Provinces, I am consulting Governors further, and willsend a supplementary telegram once I have had their reaction. Broadly speaking,however, satisfied as I am that the case for expansion and popular representationof Central Government here is, in present circumstances, a very strong one, 1should, as at present advised, be disposed, even if Congress refuse to co-operate,to take risks involved and to go ahead with the expansion of my Council. I dealwith detail of such expansion in paragraph 9 below. It would be necessary, if.the Cabinet were disposed to approve that line, to consider very carefully the tactical handling of moves leading up to an announcement and the nature of anysuch announcement. My own provisional view at present stage is that, in theevent of you and Cabinet being prepared to approve (a) expansion, (b) some further announcement or clarification, possibly on the lines as to which Itentatively sounded Gandhi or something short of that, I should move down toDelhi for a week or so for the purpose of seeing political leaders (it is mostinconvenient that they should have to come up here), and that I should then seeseparately Kalam Azad (whoever he wants to bring with him from Congress),Jinnah, Ambedkar, the leader of Mahasabha (with whom I hope to have a wordanyway this week), possibly a Forward Bloc representative and a representativeof the Princes; that I should put to them the possibility of a further clarificationon the general lines indicated in the skeleton declaration which I sketched in mytalk with Gandhi, subject to such modifications as you and Cabinet might wish,and ask whether they would see advantage in any such further clarification, andwhether either (a) with or (b) without it they would be prepared to co-operate in an expanded Executive Council on the basis of the November offer. If, as on present information would appear likely to be the case, the parties other thanCongress are prepared to do so, we should then be in a position to make anannouncement, if that appeared desirable (and on the whole I am disposed tothink that there would be advantage in it, both because it would strengthen thehands of moderate element and because it would bring out unreasonableness of congress attitude). The wording of any announcement would have to be carefully considered and agreed between us. It could best, I think, be made simultaneously here and in Parliament, and would review the course of my discussions, making clear the decision which His Majesty&apos;s Government were taking as regards expansion, the importance they attach to popularising the basisof Central Government, their regret that Congress were not prepared to accept that offer, their satisfaction that, even if the largest political party was not repre-sented, the Council in its expanded state would represent far more than themajority of political opinion in British India, and widely diverse political opinion at that, based, His Majesty&apos;s Government were glad to think, on healthyprinciple of coalition rather than on any divisions based on community orreligious faith. As we should, in fact, if we were able to get into Council repre-sentatives of interests mentioned, have produced something far more representative than Congress, and should have split any communal front and be working as a coalition basis to something holding out more hope of constructiveadvance in the future, I should have thought that we could face up to any counter-propaganda by Congress in the United States of America or elsewhere. I do notoverlook the importance of Gandhi&apos;s suggestion that the principle guiding any
expansion of that type from which Congress is excluded should not be the&apos;,&apos; smashing of Congress,&quot; and that we should do our utmost to try to keep it onnormal and reasonable lines.  I touch on States&apos; aspect in paragraph 10 below.7. When I discussed with Zetland and His Majesty&apos;s late Governmentexpansion of my Council last October, I had in mind addition of some three orfour politicians. I contemplated keeping minimum of three service membersrequired by Act of 1935, and incidentally, by doing so, covering retention of a european element. I suggested that there would be advantage in relievingCommander-in-Chief of Defence portfolio and of his responsibilities as a Memberof my Council, and so getting him freedom for purely military work, an Indianbeing appointed to be Defence Member; and I had it in mind that it might benecessary to ask certain existing members of my Council to resign to make way for politicians, since there would naturally be a limit to number of appointmentsfrom Delhi establishment made unless we were to make appointments without portfolio, to which I would see objection. (In any appointments made since thewar, the members concerned have been warned and have agreed that they mightbe required to vacate their places in favour of political leaders in the event ofa reconstruction.)8. His Majesty&apos;s Government, I think it is fair to say, were in generalagreement with the line I had suggested, save that they were not prepared to contemplate the removal of defence portfolio from Commander-in-Chief, whichthey thought would produce at home a very bad effect in war time.9. Thinking over this issue again, I have reached the following conclusions.In considering them it should be remembered that matters have advanced a gooddeal since last October : (a) There is considerable political pressure for appointment of an Indianas Defence Member and relieving of Commander-in-Chief of his Councilresponsibilities. I do not, however, over-estimate its importance, and, if HisMajesty&apos;s Government remain of their previous view, have no doubt that,whatever the political advantage of such a move from Indian standpoint, it couldbe resisted. That sooner or later we shall have to face the issue I do not doubt.But I think (any possible reactions at home apart) that we should have very carefully to consider disadvantage here, and I have little doubt, in the light of friendly and objective discussion with Chief, that in time of war they are substantial the effect on Indian soldier, who would be disposed to regard this as a significant sign of crumbling and whose morale might suffer; thedisheartening effect on Indian Officers and on the British soldier, of putting him,as he would see it, under an Indian Minister; the reaction of Nepal and of theGurkha troops, which would, in Chiefs view, be serious. Moreover, we could hardly make this move in India without producing a corresponding demand in burma, where risks in some ways might be even greater, while it is arguable thatin neither country is a critical period of war, when maintenance of militaryprestige and morale is of such great importance, the time to make a change of this character. On the whole, I would judge these objections, which are clearly of real substance, to be fatal to the idea of any immediate change, but I feel it only right that the point should be carried on any review such as present of a possiblereconstitution of my Council.(b) I should be prepared, if necessary vacancies could not be found otherwise,to reduce service membership of my Council (this could require amendment of act) from 3 to 2, and I would in that event contemplate keeping Home and finance portfolios in the hands of service members qualified under Act and allowing Maxwell and Raisman to carry on.(c) I think it important in any event to keep Mudaliar and Zafruliah Khan.Mudaliar can be regarded as a semi-political Councillor and as representing the&quot; liberal &quot; element, and he has been Deputy President of very important SouthIndian Justice party. Zafruliah Khan I am anxious to keep both on merits and because it is essential to have some competent Moslem element in my Cabinet,other than Jinnah or nominee. I should on the whole be disposed, if sufficientvacancies could not be found otherwise, to let Bajpai go in the interest of makingroom for someone from outside.id) I would be prepared to contemplate possible expansion up to a maximumfigure of twelve, if necessary, though I would not propose to make that figurepublic or even give it away in discussion with political leaders. That is abouta workable limit.   We might of course (and that, I think, should be our object)
get away with a smaller expansion. But if the principle of expansion was accepted, it ought to be possible to consider finding place for representatives of interests I have mentioned above, either (a) by resignations of one or two existing members or (b) by creation of additional portfolios for, e.g., (1) propaganda;(2) A.R.P. (this would relieve Home Department, at present heavily pressed by legislation; (3) splitting (1 law) and Supply; (4) possibly splitting Com-munication into Railways (? and) balance of present communication port-folio; (5) possibly splitting Education, Health and Lands which could easily be done into two portfolios; (6) splitting Commerce and Labour; while were you and the Cabinet to favour creation of a Defence portfolio to be held by apolitician, that would of course give one more place to fill. We ought with luckto be able to give representation to those now prepared to co-operate, and to keeptwo or three seats in reserve in case Congress should later change its mind.10. The arrangements I have contemplated do not, as you will see, envisageinclusion in my Council of a representative of Indian States. My own mind isquite open on that, though I have always been apprehensive that we should havecriticism from British India of inclusion of a prominent Dewan in Governor-GeneraFs Council, and so of giving the States a foothold in the Council, evenindirectly, at a time when British India had no corresponding foothold or leverin respect of the States. I do not over-estimate the importance of that argument,but it may have some substance. Jinnah, as you will have seen, did not favour the inclusion of any Princely representative. I did not discuss it with Gandhi.I am on the whole inclined to think that there is something in Jinnah&apos;s suggestion(I had already been working on something of the same type) that we should(corrupt group) along with (? specified) expanded Executive Council set up a carefully selected War Advisory Committee. This might meet every couple ofmonths, be sworn to secrecy, be entitled to be taken into confidence and to putforward suggestions, &amp;c, and would in fact be much the same as consultative committee proposed last November, though I would aim at making it much smaller. On that Committee we could give substantial representation byallotting, say, 3 seats out of 12 to the Princes, filling remaining seats not so much on the basis of proportional strength of parties as by inclusion, of men of substance and standing (e.g., on the assumption that Congress would not play,Sapru, Sultan Ahmed, Chhatari, the Kumar Rajah of Chettmad for South IndianJustice Party, a Sikh, Rajah as representing other section of Scheduled Caste,perhaps Chiminlal Setalvad as representing National Liberal Federation, HomiMody, Jamnadas Mehta, N. R. Sarkar (if not employed in Central Government),possibly a Dewan such as Akbar Hydari, in addition to Princely representatives).11. These I recognise may be regarded as&apos;somewhat revolutionary ideas, butI am satisfied now that I have had these conversations with Jinnah and Gandhithat we have either got to stand fast on our present position, doing without active support of either Congress or the Moslem League, and in face of a public opinion which clearly favours some closer association of Indian non-official element withthe war, and which is disposed (though without thinking out clearly what is involved) to press for further constitutional advances or clarifications, &quot; national governments,&quot; &amp;c, or to make a move on the general lines I suggest; and my own feeling is definitely that the course of wisdom, subject to anything I may receive from the Governors, lies in going ahead on these lines. It wouldincidentally have the great advantage of producing a coalition (even thoughwithout Congress) and of avoiding a communal collision. But I am sure thatspeed is of essence of this business if we are to move, and I hope therefore thatyou will be able to let me know the feeling of the Cabinet or any point on whichthey might wish for my further views, at as early a date as possible. If anythingof the order which I have sketched out is acceptable to you and to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and proves workable in the light of further discussions with political leaders here, then there would probably be advantage, if the reconstitutedExecutive Council agreed, in an early meeting of the Legislature. It would bepossible to call a meeting of the Legislature, which I would endeavour to confineif possible to about a fortnight for the second half of August in Delhi, for whichI could go down from here, thereafter adjourning until November. It is moreimportant to get an early decision, since considerable expectations and muchspeculation have not unnaturally been aroused by the visits of Gandhi and Jinnah.
DRAFT   STATEMENT1.    At this moment in the world struggle against aggression and tyranny His Majesty&apos;a Government feel assured that it is the earnest wish of the great majority of thepeople of India to throw themselves wholeheartedly andunitedly into the defence of their country and of the common cause.    They believe that this unity of national purpose will be helped, and some of the misunderstandings which have arisen in recent months removed, by a clear statement oftheir attitude to the steps to be taken towards the declaredgoal of British policy in India.2.    It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat Inuia should attain, at the earliest practicable momentafter the war, to her natural and rightful position as an equal partner-member in the British Commonwealth of Nations,as free to control her own affairs and shape her own destinyas the United Kingdom or the Dominions.3. They recognise the right of India herself to framethe permanent structure of the Constitution under which she is to regulate her own affairs. They are thereforewilling that immediately after the war the constitution should be examined anew in all its aspects, central and provincial, by whatever Indian constituent body maymeanwhile be agreed upon by representatives of the main elements in India&apos;s national life.h.    Agreement is of the essence of the matter.    HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not contemplate surrendering^theirpresent responsibility for the peace and welfare of India toany system of government whose authority was directly deniedby large and powerful elements in India&apos;s national life,nor could they be parties to the coercion of such elementsinto submission to such a government.    They are convincedthat agreement is possible, and is desired by the vast majority of the people of India.    For their part they wouldbe most willing to examine forthwith all possibilities ofovercoming the inherent difficulties of the situation and to lend any assistance in their power to bring the various parties together.It follows, of course, that the same principle ofagreement must form the basis of decisions to be taken as tothe composition of the constituent body, the method ofselecting its members and the machinery by which it willarrive at its conclusions&quot;.5.    Given the necessary measure of agreement His Majesty&apos;Government are prepared to accept as the permanent structure of the new Indian polity the provisions of any indian constitution that may be adopted by such a constituent body.This permanent structure will not necessarily of itself make provision for the existing responsibilities and obligations which/

which Great Britain&apos;a long connexion with India has imposedupon her, or for the necessity for close co-operation in defence and foreign policy which will subsist until india is able to meet unaided her needs in this field.    Theprincipal obligations here referred to, besides those relating to India&apos;s defence, concern the fulfilment of obligations to the States in so far as they are notcompletely incorporated in the new Indian polity, andthe securing of the reasonable rights of existing membersof the Services recruited by the Secretary of State.It is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government thatthese obligations and needs can most appropriately be fulfilled through the provisions of an Instrument ofAgreement as between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theproposed constituent body acting on behalf of the new government of India.    This agreement would be for astated period of years renewable by negotiation in sofar as circumstances might require and would for itsduration be embodied as an integral part of the newIndian Constitution and enter into force concurrently with it.6.    It is obvious that no such fundamentalreconsideration of the existing Indian Constitution can take place in the midst of a great war.    But within that Constitution His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxiousto enlist to the full the active cooperation of all parties and elements in the political life of India.In pursuance of that object H.E. the Governor-general has been authorised to invite representatives of themore important parties and communities in British Indiato join his Executive Council, as well as to associatewith them in a wider War Council representatives of theIndian States and of other interests in the national life of India as a whole.    The Governors of the Provincesnow directly administered under s.93 of the Government ofIndia Act have been similarly instructed to further any steps which will facilitate the resumption with general assent of responsible government in their Provinces.His Majesty&apos;s Government hope and believe that inthis way India will be able, even within the limits ofthe present Constitution,  to play her appropriate partin the conduct of the war and to prepare herself for the tasks of a full and free national life which lie beforeher.
