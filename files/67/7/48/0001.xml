USE OF UNIVERSITIES FOR ARMY PURPOSES.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for WarsIn order to meet the need for training more officersand to provide suitable accommodation for tho^s purpose,I ask my colleagues to consider the use of UnaVersities.2. The supply of officer material with the necessarytechnical and educational qualifications for training inOfficer Cadet Training Units of Royal Engineers, Royal corps of Signals and, to a certain extent, Royal Artillery, isdrying up and the shortage is rapidly becoming acute.Boys on leaving school can he selected for the Royal navy and the Royal Air Force between the ages of 18 years and18 years 6 months, can join Home Defence Units of the army at the age of 18 with the possibility of going to anOfficer Cadet Training Unit   at the age of 19, or can join the L.D.V. With these counter attractions they are loth togo on with their dducational training at Universities.In order to ensure that an adequate supply of hoysgo to the Universities to study the necessary subjects,some inducement is necessary.A scheme has been prepared, which has receivedsupport from University and School authorities, by which,after an examination at School boys wishing to join the units concerned shall be attested and after a shortpreliminary training in Young Soldier Companies of theHome Defence Battalions, should go to selected universitiesfor- a course of six months duration on a syllabus to be laiddown by the War Office.    During this course they wouldbelong to the Training G-ot-ps of the University.      on completion of the course, those recommended for commissionswould complete their military training at one of theO.C.T.Us. of the arm of the Service they select.    By sucha scheme the necessary supply of potential officers wouldbe ensured and, further, the boy could he commissionedat the age at which he is normally called up.     Thenumbers required is about 2,400 a year.      In order to ensurethat the^e was no financial bar to attendance at these courses a small subsidy would be necessary.3. Although there is a disinclination on the part of boys to continue education after leaving school a certainnumber may still wish to attend the Universities with aview to obtaining scientific, engineering or similar posts in industry or to qualify themselves for the medical profession.    Th^se should be encouraged or the supply fromthese important professions will also dry up.    Adequateaccommodation nust, therefore, be reserved at Universitiesfor their use.-.

In order to enable these students to take their partin the defence of the country, the Training Corps shouldhe changed to a Home Defence Unit with local obligationsinto which they may enlist04. To enable Officer Cadet Training Units to hemoved from coastal areas and in order to make room for other purposes such as winter accommodation for field units or for formation of new units some of theexisting Officer Cadet Training Units should be moved to selected Universities where the type of accommodation which can be made available is generally suitable forthis type of unit.   A survey of accommodation is nowbeing carried out.5. University authorities who have been approachedare, generally spea&quot;;-:ing, in agreement with this scheme.60 The War Cabinet are asked to agreeJ-(a) That in order to make up the shortage of potential officers for technical arms,certain selected Universities should runa series of courses of six months1  durationto give suitable boys education in the required technical subjects.(b) That the courses referred to in (a) should be subsidised.(c) That undergraduates now studying technical?scientific and medical subjects should be permitted to continue their studies and thatboys wishing to attend universities with aview to studying such subjects should be encouraged to do so.(d) That in order to enable those referred to in(c) to take their part in Home Defence, the senior T.O. should be changed into HomeDefence Units and all students be required tojoin.(e) That where suitable, certain existing OfficerCadet Training Units should be moved toselected Universities dependent on the accommodation which can be made available.
