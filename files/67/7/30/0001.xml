COPY NO,WAR   CABINETFRENCH SHIPS IN BRITISH PORTSMemorandum by Minister of Shipping -There are now 81 French Merchant ships in United Kingdom ports and 35 inBritish controlled ports overseas.     The total tonnage of these vessels isL&amp;i-jOOO gross tons.     In addition there is a considerable number of smaller craftincluding tugs, pilot boats, fishing vessels etc.It is undesirable to have vessels in such numbers idle in our ports while thereis risk of enemy action.     Also the uncertainty as to their future is affecting the crews and trouble is likely to arise.     The authorities at Glasgow have been compelled to remove the crews of two French vessels on security grounds.Temporary measures have been taken to ensure that the crews are fed, and alsoto supply them with some ready money so as to pacify them for the time being.The major problem of disposing of the vessels and their crews remains for urgentsettlement.The problem is complicated by the consideration that there are 31 british vessels, (90,000 gross tons), and 54 Allied vessels, (180,000 gross tons), in ports in France and French Possessions.     The French authorities are detaining these ships.The ultimate disposition of the Frenoh vessels in our hands may be affectedby the attitude of the French towards the British and Allied vessels which theyare detaining.     It is important if possible to secure the release of the Britishand Allied vessels and their crews.     Some exchange may prove possible and, unless we are likely to be in a position to secure release of these ships by direct action ymay be desirable in the long run.     Immediately however, it is essential to freeour ports as soon as possible of the idle French ships and the disaffected Frenchcrews.     Urgent employment can be found for a substantial number of the French ocean-going cargo vessels.In these circumstances I suggest the following procedure :-CRET^S ON BOARD FRENCH MERCHANT SHIPS IN UNITED KINGDOM PORTS.The first step should be to separate the office .s and seamen willing to find employment in our service from those who prefer to return to France.   General de Gaullehas been requested to assist in encouraging seamen to serve by arranging for naval officers serving with him to visit the ships.     It is proposed also to distributeimmediately a pamphlet setting out the terms of employment for seamen wishing toremain in our service.     Thereafter the Home Security authorities will remove fromtheir ships all French seamen, separating those who are willing to find employmentin our service from those who prefer to be repatriated.     The latter will be brougb&apos;together in one centre under the control of the Security authorities untilrepatriation can be arranged.The terms of service for French seamen employed in our ships would he the sameas for British seamen, including compensation in the event of war death or disability .it is open to question whether, in present circumstances, we should be wise in allowingFrench ships to sail manned wholly by French officers and seamen and I propose toconsider this matter further when I Know the response to our offer.
It will be impossible to trade these under the French flag as theywould remain under the control of the French Government, which is under an obligation to recall them to French or neutral ports.     It is unlikelythat the German Government would countenance any arrangement by which the prench Government voluntarily left ships in our service.     It is proposed,therefore, that the ships should be requisitioned and placed under theBritish flag.     I am advised that this can best be done under the requisitioning powers of the Defence Regulations.   I am also advised that once our possession of the ships has been e stablished through the properrequisitioning procedure, they would be protected in some neutral countries, though not in all, against action by the French government or the French owners to secure possession of them through the Courts,as the latter would not entertain actions against ships in the possessionof a Sovereign power.     It is expected that the Courts in the UnitedStates would take this line.Once the vessels have been requisitioned those most urgently neededcan be manned either with British or French crews and put into employment.Requisitioning under the Defence Regulations would establish a olaimto compensation by the owners under the Compensation (Defence). Act.Apart from this statutory claim, there would, be a claim to full compensatiorunder international law.   Claims by the French Government would have to hedealt with in accordance with any general settlement of Franco-Britishclaims.ACTION AS RjGARDS BRITISH AND ALLHilD SHIPb IN FRENCH POKES.Most of the British ships in French hands are in Moroccan and west african ports.     If no other means of securing their release presents itselfwe may have to consider an arrangement for the reciprocal release of ships and crews on the basis of ton for ton.     If the War Cabinet approve, i will explore with the French Mission the possibility of securing the releaseof some ships in connection with the repatriation of French Merchant seamen.&apos;rAs regards Polish ships, of which there are seven in Moroccan and west african ports, we should try to secure release in the same way as british ships.As regards Norwegian ships, these are on time charter to the FrenchGovernment and ought to be relased under an arrangement made with the FrenchMission in London just before the naval action at Oran.   It is not known whether the French Government will abide by this arrangement in presentcircumstances.     Their attitude may be affected by the position in Norway ifthe Germans are successful in establishing a rival Norwegian Government.the other hand, the French Government will not wish to incur financialliabilities for ships which they cannot employ and they may, therefore, bethe more disposed to release them.CO-OPERATION -..IT,: GENERAL PS GAULLE&apos;S ORGANISATION.I have considered whether it would be possible to operate any french ships in our hands under the control of General de Gaulle.     There would beno legal basis for General de Gaulle&apos;s control and there is no alternative.
to placing the vessels under the British flag.     It.would be impossible torecognise any claim by General de Gaulle to the earnings of the ships sincethe French owners, (or the French Government), will have a claim forcompensaion in respect of which General de Gaulle is not in a position to indemnify us.As regards the French seamen, however, who are willing to remain inour service it might be possible for them to be linked with General de Gaulle&apos;organisation.The fore-going proposals relate to French Merchant vessels, and for thetine  being it is proposed to confine the measures to those in the UnitedKingdom ports where the problem is most urgent.     The smaller craft - tugs,pilot boats and fishing vessels - will require separate consideration.CARGOES IN FRENCH SHIPS.In the meantime it is urgently necessary to move French ships fromports at which they are now lying in cases where the cargoes cannot be discharged there.     These cargoes are urgently required, mainly by theMinistry of Supply and the ships should be put into a position to dischargeso as to clear the ports as soon as possible.   I have accordingly asked the First Lord of the Admiralty to provide armed guards for any shipswhere the Master and crew are willing to move and to arrange that theship shall be sent to her discharging port - where I will requisition the cargo as soon as possible.     where the Master refuses to move the ship itwill be necessary to await   action taken as a result of this memorandum.R,H. G,Ministry of Shipping.10th July, 1940.
