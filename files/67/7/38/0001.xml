THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF PUS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. Copy No. . .. .V. ..........W.P.(G. )(MJ188.17th July, 19hO.WAR     CABINET.The Control of Shipping as an instrument of Economic Warfare.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of shipping and the Minister of Economic Warfare.1.      In W.P.(hO)259 of July 12th, the Minister of economic warfare referred to the control of world shipping as a possibleaid to economic warfare.   This question has been jointly, studied by the Ministries of Shipping and Economic Warfare, and we. now ....make\&quot;certain proposals to the Cabinet.2.     The extension of the blockade to almost all Europe hasdeprived many vessels of their normal employment, and there is an obvious danger that neutral ship-owners, who find legitimatecargoes difficult to obtain, may be tempted to ply a lessdesirable trade.To counter this we propose that further neutral tonnageshould be chartered, and, if surplus to other requirements, shouldbe used according to the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s recommerid-ation in E.P.(M)(h0)(h5) to bring additional supplies fromdistant sources where no difficulties of exchange exist and forother suitable purposes.3.     Even so, there will remain a large block of neutralocean-going tonnage outside our service which may he used forpurposes of which we disapprove.   This can best be dealt withby a policy of discrimination in the grant of shipping facilities..Foreign ship-owners at present obtain the following Britishcontrolled facilities:-Access to bunkers,Repair facilities,War Risk and Marine Insurance,Ship stores and water,Admiralty charts,Pacilites for cables, comraunicationsand financial transfers.Though we have no monopoly in any of these services, noship-owner engaged in world trade could carry on his &quot;businesswithout great inconvenience should he be denied all our facilitiesor allowed them on less favourable terms than his competitors.The maintenance of these facilities in time of war is difficult in certain cases, notably War Risks Insurance.    Their continuancecan only be assured by special efforts.h.     We, therefore, propose that the above mentionedfacilities should, within the limits of political possibility,in future only be made available to those ship-owners whoundertake not to engage in practices objectionable to his majesty&apos;s Government.These would be defined as:-(a) permitting any of their ships to sail for Europeanports with cargo not fully navicerted or otherwiseapproved,(b)/
(b)-&apos;&apos;&quot;ca^riying car-goes from adjacent neutral countries.....without certificates showing that these goods arenot of enemy origin,(c) unreasonably obstructing measures to identify andrestrain trade with the enemy,(d) refusing, or sheltering behind the refusal of agovernment, to conclude on;request a satisfactorytrade agreement with the United Kingdom in respectof shipping. ; ....L:&apos;5. The effect of &quot;these measures would be to divide world shippinginto three classes:. &apos;   ,.. - . &apos;.&apos;.&apos;(a)    Ships under British and Allied control..(h)   Ships--under neutral control.whose owners have engaged   :themselves to refrain from oh jectionable trade.(c)   Actual or potential &quot;blockade runners&quot;.    These includeenemy .ships in enemy and neutral ports, and prohahlysome French, Danish, Japanese, Panamanians and Greeks.We should thus;reduce&quot; the problem presented by class (c) forour Intelligence and Naval Authorities from unmanageable to manageabldimensions. ......,6,     The Cabinet has already approved the proposal of the Ministerof-Economic Warfare to make Ships&apos; Nayicerts compulsory.   No publie ithas so far been given to this decision.    Meanwhile, the Admiralty are considering how.best to make this step effective.    If our present proposals are approved, it will he essential to their full successthat the policy behind them shall he clearly defined, firmly pursuedand generally understood.    They should, therefore, he announced&apos;atthe same time as the compulsory Navicert system, and, should the   ,&apos;;: ;;Cahinet decide in favour of more drastic naval action to enforce the &quot;blockade, we suggest this should also he announced simultaneously7*    We propose, therefore.-&quot;^(a)   That additional neutral tonnage should he :.chartered and&apos;&apos;used as suggested in paragraph (h).(h)   That, in future, only those neutral ships whose owners ..refrain from objectionable practices should he entitled -to British controlled shipping facilities on the same&quot;. -terms as British ships.  &apos; - -   &quot;(c)   That the three new measures designed to enforce the blockade, namely, compulsory Ships*: Navicerts,discrimination in the grant of shipping-facilities and.more drastic naval action,;should he made public at the &quot;same. time....
