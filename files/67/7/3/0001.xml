(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S (XJVERNMEMT).secret copy No.77. P. (G) (LO) 153June 15th.WAR     CABINETHITLER   INTERVIEWNote by Minister of Information.I circulate for the information of the War CabinetKarl von Wiegan&amp;!s account of his interview with Hitler.D.Q.

&quot;With German arnies nearing Paris thirteen Americas toAmericans, Europe to Europeans&quot;.    If this reciprocal basic monroe doctrine were mutually observed, declared Adolf Hitler to me today, notonly would it ensure peace for all. tine between the old and new worldsbut would be the nost ideal foundation for peace throughout the whole world.In caustic language with scorn and indignation he denounced&quot;lies&quot; that he has or ever had &quot;dream or thought&quot; 01- played with thefaintest idea of interfering in the Western Hemisphere by any manneror means.He characterized America&apos;s fears of him or Germany as mostflattering but &quot;childish and grotesque&quot; and the whole idea of thepossibility of an invasion of the United States from Europe by sea, airor &quot;mythical fifth column&quot; as &quot;stupid and fantastic&quot;.The German war machine whose amazing perfection, organization,strength, strategical and tactical leadership has star-bled world is nor/just outside Paris.   Hitler told me he&apos;d no-intention of attacking thebeautiful French Capital if it &quot;remains an 3ipen city like Brussels&quot;.The Fuehrer denied vehemently that he ever had, or even now has, as hiswar aim the &quot;smashing of the British Empire&quot;;; but with bitter anger hedeclared &quot;Ifll destroy those men who are destroying that Empire&quot;.   he spoke most warmly of Premier Mussolini and welcomed Italy1s entrance intothe war and &quot;comradeship of arms&quot;.An aeroplane picked me up at the airport of a city where sirensdeep baying anti-aircraft guns dull explosions which sounded like bombs had awakened me after midnight.   I so tired I did not care what happened tome and I went to sleep again in the plane.We landed in field; then there were hours of motoring in opencar under blazing sun.   German Foreign Minister received me large ChateauHeadquarters of a Division General with a peppery name just behind leftwing German front.I&apos;d interesting talk Foreign Minister.   After talking with him,German General, and another member General Staff, I was driven by carmany miles rendezvous Fuehrer.Hitler dashed up in six-wheeled open car sitting besidechauffeur with second car following; there was clicking of heels andoutstretching arras in salute.Von Ribbentrop greeting him at entrance.It is two years since my last talk Hitler.With portraits of Belgian and French beauties recalling daysthat will never return looking down at us, we sat in drawing-room.Minister Von Ribbentrop, Doctor Dietrich, Minister Schmidt,Counsellor of the Legation Hewell and others were present.The Fuehrer had insisted on formulating replies to my questions in writing.   With these in hand he discussed them nearly hour.He began America&apos;s attitude toward Germany his attitudetoward Germany.

i23&quot;Germany is one of the few countries v/hich hitherto has refrainedinterfering any way in Aneriea.   He wanted remind ne &quot;at no tine hasGermany had any territorial or political interest in American continent&quot;.Then with rising voice declared &quot;Nor has Germany any such interest now;whoever states anything contrary is ljdjig deliberately for sone purpose;hovv Anerican Continent shapes or leads its life is no concern of nine andof no interest to Gernany; and that let ne say holds good not only for north Anerica hut equally so for South Anerica; but let ne observe this:I do not believe doctrine such as proclaimed by your president Monroe canbe interpreted to have been or to be unilateral clain to no intervention.&quot;Actual purpose of Monroe doctrine, I believe, wasnt onlyconceived and proclaimed to prevent European countries fron interferingin Anerica - which England with her great territorial and political interest in Anerica continually does - but likewise to restrain Anericafron interfering or nixing in European affairs.&quot;George Washington1s own warning to Anerican people confirms the logical reasonableness of such an interpretation.   I therefore sayAmerica for Americans, Europe for Europeans11    Asked hoy/ he viewedAmerica&apos;s rearmament programme as announced and advocated by president roosevelt, Hitler said &quot;In answering that question I shall once nore applyMonroe Doctrine and therefore refrain from expressing ny opinion or viewson United States armament programme.   America&apos;s armng is none of nybusiness; I am in no way interested in it.   I myself have been compelledto carry out the greatest armament programme the world ever seen, so thatI for one am in position to distinguish very well indeed between colourfulfabulations and real possibilities or practicabilities.    There seem to be some.       fanciful views on that subject&quot;.I tried to draw out Fuehrer on America&apos;s sales of war material to allies.    &quot;America1 s intervention in. Europe in, the shape of massdeliveries of aircraft and other war materials cannot affect outcome ofthis conflict&quot; declared Fuehrer with emphatic finality.    &quot;Its not necessaryfor ne to give ny reasons for this in detail.   In the end reality will decide&quot;.I touched upon Fifth Column which seems have fired theimagination of many countries.   With touch of sarcasn Hitler said &quot;Socalled fifth column conveys nothing to ne because it doesnt exist exceptin the imagination of fantastic ninds or as phanton created by unscrupulouspropaganda for obvious purposes by incompetent governments who drive theirpeoples into war and then experience pitiable collapsed.Its understandable they prefer shift responsibility elsewhere.Main object of this propaganda slogan is to find a collectiveterm for internal opposition v/hich of course exists in all countries,composed of extreme nationalists, internationally-ninded Corxiunists,pacifists, and others opposed to war.&quot;Since politicians of those countries are unable to deal withtheir opposition decently, they proceed to accuse those elements of hightreason, cloaking their illegal nethods with patriotic arguments andmotivate their action norally in the eyes of the world by applyingairraising tern &quot;Fifth Column&quot;.&quot;Our opponents are going to lose the war because their.militaryorganizations are bad, their leadership worse, their conduct of warinstances disastrous&quot;.Again Hitler emphasized it v/as England which declared war against Germany on &quot;ridiculous stupid pretexts&quot;, adding &quot;Germany will winwar because German people know their cause is just and they knav what they

fighting for and because Gernan military organization and leadership is better.   -We shall win because we have best army, best equipment&quot;.I asked &quot;Was it one of his aims to destroy British Empire&quot;.&quot;It never has been ny ain or intention to destroy British Empire&quot;Fuehrer vigorously declared. &quot;On the contrary, just before outbreak ofthis war which I reiterate was launched by Britain and France, Isubnitted proposal to British Government wherein I went to the length of offering arned assistance of the Reich for safeguarding British Empire.My Offer was scorned. I&apos;ve asked nothing of England except that germany should be considered and. treated as an equal j that England would protectGerman coast if Germany becane involved in warj and that I be givenGernan Colonies - and I&apos;ll get then.&quot;Openly it was declared and printed in London that NationalSocialism must be destroyed and that Germany must be broken up, utterlydisarmed and made powerless.   Never hove I voiced any such ains ofintentions against Britain.   When battle after battle went againstEngland rulers in London appealed to America with tears in their eyesdeclaring that Germany was threatening and seeking to break up BritishEmpire.   One thing its true is going to be destroyed that iscapitalistic clique which was and still is prepared to sacrifice nillionsof human lives for their mean petty personal interests (and that I&apos;nconvinced will be done not by me but by their own people).   Fuehrerdeclared this War certainly would scrap British system of self control as now exercised by England and that would be great Blessing world future.Freedom of seas which Germany has in mind absolutely in Trade between themselves unconditionally without being subject to any control by thewarring powers&quot;.   Hitler added laws that would really restrict blockadeto Coasts of warring countries wouldnt be affected by such connonsensechange.   Fuehrer declared Gernany has &quot;neither territorial nor political interest in the Mediterranean&quot; continuing &quot;the German nation refuses toaccept conceptions whereby everybody is entitled or even bound to interfereeverywhere and with everything &quot;if certain nations - Britain and Francetake lead ar.long those - see fit to declare they and they alone haveinterests all over the world.   This constitutes clain to world dominationwhich &quot;awakening peoples will not tolerate in long run.   Germany for one,will not tolerate that other powers concern themselves with her livingspace.   In return she will refrain from intruding in affairs outside her own vital sphere and which mainly concern other Nations.   If, as has beenthe case, British Cabinet Minister declares that Englands^rontier isRhine this is really linit both as regards stupidity and unbearablearrogance, 1* could hardly be nore stupid to declare that Germany1 sfrontier is Mississippi, Amazon, or Yangtze.   Incidentally we shall nowsettle this question of Rhine frontier once and for all so that in futureits to be hoped British Brine Ministers will not be liable to suchgeograiDhic delusions.   I asked further if he would give ne an outline orsone idea of his conception of peace to come.   I said I had heard so muchabout &quot;revolutionary concept of iDeace&quot;. which he had in mind and that peace treaty would be very short.   Hitler was disinclined to commit himself at this tine.   He said &quot;Theres only one German Peace Ain andthats establishment of Peace.   Let ne remind you again it wasnt Germanywho declared War on England and France, but England and France whodeclared War against Germany on most ridiculous pretext.   Principle onwhich Peace is founded will however be realization of fact there can beno real peace unless the vital requirements of great Nations be dulyrespected and that only fool can believe that super Versailles could beimprovement on international.   Cliques who live by inciting peoples to-3

hatred and who seek to conceal or even suppress the consequences oftheir inborn political inefficiency or their ecsononic failure byresorting to war,   I an aware of fact this ain ccnnot he reached bytreaties alone but nust cane about by the dsmiiag of reason .withinNations in spite of all prevailing hysteria and all attenpts to leadWorld astray.   I still believe in this regardless of all fairy talesand atrocity propaganda regardless of Fifth Colunns Parachute Buns etc.If Military defeat of Great Britain, Franoe should bring about victory of reason, even in those countries the sacrifices of this War willperhaxDS for future of World not have been so in vain as it nay now seen.As Hitler arose and shook hands with ne I asked hin once nore to spareParis if possible. He replied &quot;You have that at heart no nore than Ihave and you will be no nore happy than I111 be if French Arny Leadersshow corxionsense and make that possible for ne&quot;.THOMPSON +++END MSG TIME 2116.
