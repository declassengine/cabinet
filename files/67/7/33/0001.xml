Since the 7th February, 1940, there has been an increase of about26,000 in the number engaged in the yards; of these 21,000 have been requiredfor naval work and merchant repairs, leaving only about 5,000 for newmerchant construction; in these circumstances the attainment of a programmeof 1,100,000 gross tons of merchant shipbuilding is a creditable achievement.2. There has been an increase of shipping under our control in the lasttwo months. There are 175,000 more gross tons (ships of 500 gross tons ormore) under the British flag than at the outbreak of the war; and, in addi-tion, considerable sections of the Norwegian, Dutch and Belgian fleets-are under our control. The Ministry has now more shipping than is required[21503]
to handle the programmes of the buying departments. If ports are damaged or prohibited, this will reduce the maximum amount of shipping that wecan use.3. With an easy shipping position, it may be inexpedient to mobilizestill further additional engineering labour for shipbuilding at a time whenother demands for engineering labour are so large and pressing. I am therefore inclined to rest on a new building rate of 1,100,000 tons a year for1941.4. On the other hand, sinkings in the last month have shown a large increase; if this is due to the release of a special effort by the enemy or to atemporary diversion of our escort units to other duties, the increase gives no ground for alarm; but, if it is due to the loss of the French ports or otherenduring adverse factors, a grave situation will develop and every possiblenew ship will be needed.5. Trade figures for June will not be available until the 16th July.Imports, ex-oil, in May were 4-3 million tons (monthly average January-April 4 million) and exports 3-7 million tons (monthly average January-April 3-4 million).w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,July 12, 1940.
Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1940..SECRET Copy No.   5w.p. (g.) (40) 183.July 9, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY..It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.MERCHANT SHIPBUILDING.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.WHEN the Merchant Shipbuilding and Repairs Organisation was transferred from the Ministry of Shipping to the Admiralty on the 1st February,1940, the Admiralty was given the tasks of increasing the output of new merchant ships to the rate of 1,500,000 gross tons per annum in twelve months, that isby February 1941, and of hastening the return to service of Merchant ships inrepairers&apos; hands on account of war and marine casualties and normal voyagerepairs or for equipment with defensive armament.The amount of work that can be done in merchant shipbuilding and repairsis largely conditioned by the essential needs of the Navy for new construction,repairs, refits and conversions. The Controller M.S.R. and the Controller ofthe Navy have therefore maintained close co-operation subject, of course, to the over-riding authority of the Board of Admiralty, who have in certain instancesgiven general instructions for the priority of Naval work.On the repair side every effort has been made to restore to service vessels which were so badly damaged as to justify, in normal conditions, their beingbroken up. Tonnage falling within this category is being restored to service atthe rate of about 100,000 gross tons per annum. The strain upon the repair sectionof the industry has been, and is, immense, primarily because of the ever-changingmethods of attack by the enemy and the fighting activities of the Navy. The generalpolicy has been to apply all possible acceleration to short jobs, and it may fairly besaid that no undue delay is now taking place with these. On the other hand,progress on heavily damaged ships is not so satisfactory, and in present circum-stances no great improvement is in sight; indeed, it may well be that repairfacilities will be substantially curtailed when bombing or other enemy action is intensified.On the 7th February, 1940, the man power in the industry was distributed asfollows : *New Naval       New Merchant    Naval Conversion     MerchantConstruction.      Construction.      and Repair Work.      Repairs. Total.41,890 23,649 26,306 30,830 122,675On the 3rd April comparable figures were: 47,554 24,816 29,07.7 36,456 137,903The latest available figures at the 26th June were : 52,659   * 29,092 30,828 35;840 148,419In addition, about 31,500 men are now employed in the Hull Departmentof the Royal Dockyards as compared with 30,500 on the 3rd April.[21503]
In February the Merchant Shipbuilding output was at. the rate of about750/800,000 gross tons per annum. To reach an.output of 1,500,000 gross tonsby February 1941 construction at that rate should have been begun in April1940, steel in the full corresponding quantity should have been available inJune 1940, and launching at that rate be begun in November/December 1940.Sufficient berths were available in February for the construction of the required tonnage; steel supplies, including a special order from America ofplates which were in short supply, had been arranged to reach the requiredquantity in June 1940, and it was thought that adequate supplies of machinery and component parts would be available, although this was contingent upon the fulfilment of orders placed abroad. Steps had been taken to produce a simplifiedform of hull design to facilitate mass production of certain parts and thus toassist in the process of dilution of labour.An organisation was set up for the fabrication of parts by structuralengineers.Facilities for building abroad had been explored, but, with the exception of hong Kong, where orders had been placed before the transfer of the organisationfrom the Ministry of Shipping, any available facilities had been deemed more suitable for Naval than Merchant needs and had been allocated to the controller of the Navy.Concrete construction was being tried out experimentally.To carry out the programme 19,000 men additional to those employed inhull construction in February were required by September 1940, but of the15,000 men entering the industry between the 7th February and the 3rd AprilDnly 1,000 had become available for new merchant construction, the balancehaving been absorbed on new Naval construction and upon Naval and Merchantrepairs. Moreover, the Naval programme will continue to absorb additionalmen until about August 1940, and transfers of man power back to merchant,work will not be sufficient until late in 1941 to enable merchant output atthe rate of 1,500,000 gross tons per annum to be reached. ,It will be observed from the June figures that employment in the repairingsection of the industry has varied little since the 3rd April, but that newNaval construction has continued to require additional men who, but for the priority accorded to Naval work, would have been absorbed in merchant ship-building. Having regard to all the circumstances the Controller M.S.E.informed the Board of Admiralty, when the Naval estimates were underdiscussion, that the Naval programme was of such magnitude as to render it unlikely that the required output of merchant ships would be reached for 1941.Subsequently fundamental changes occurred in the situation. The naval operations against Norway, the evacuation from France, the intensified mining,bombing and submarine activities of the enemy and the uncertainties of thewhole strategical position, preclude the Board pf Admiralty from assumingresponsibility for relinquishing any material or man power from Naval work.Work upon certain long dated ships has recently been suspended, but this affordsno relief to the merchant programme as the man power thus set free is requiredto accelerate other Naval vessels.Moreover, the invasion of Norway, Denmark, Holland and Belgium has cutoff important sources of supply of heavy forgings which had been relied upon forthe construction of propelling machinery for merchant vessels, and the loss of the sources of steel in Belgium and Luxemburg and of the. ore supply in scandinavia and now apparently in Spain and North Africa, militated against the supplyof finished steel necessary to augment the rate of construction of propellingmachinery in the United Kingdom, and has placed&apos; such a strain on the supply ofsteel in general as to make it unlikely that the supplies of recent months, whichwere equal to an annual rate of output pf 1,000,000 gross tons of merchantshipping, can be substantially improved.Running parallel with the stringency of steel supplies, especially forpropelling machinery service, and with the demands of Naval construction uponlabour, there are growing demands for skilled engineers for other supply services which make it more than ever difficult to provide the necessary man power to augment merchant shipbuilding output:We are now laying down ships at the rate of fully 1,000,000 gross tons perannum, and subject to no substantial interruptions in the activities, either of theindustry itself or of the steel industry supplying it, we may look for the annual
output of tonnage reaching the rate of 1,100,000 gross tons in February 1941.Beyond that I see no prospects of proceeding owing to the triple limiting factor ofsuitable man power, steel supplies and supplies of propelling machinery.Against this prospect of lower output of new snips, attention must be drawn to the very large increase to the quantity of tonnage under the control of theBritish Government arising from the extension of the war zone, as well as the curtailment of the traffic routes which has taken place in consequence.Furthermore, if circumstances arise to prevent the shipbuilding industryworking at full capacity owing to enemy action, it is probable that the capacityof our harbours for handling shipping would be correspondingly curtailed.In these circumstances it would appear that the suggested new figure of1,100,000 gross tons may not be less adequate to the present position than wasthe estimate of 1,500,000 gross tons in February last.Particular attention should be drawn to the fact that the interruption of the short sea trades, particularly through the collapse of France, has removed thevery urgent need for the coasters and the smaller type of cargo vessels in whichthere was threatened to be a serious deficiency a few months ago.A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W. 1, July 9, 1940.
