(L- V?&apos;Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1940.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 168.July 1, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.RECOGNITION OF A CZECHO-SLOVAK PROVISIONALGOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 20th December, 1939, letters were exchanged between myself and dr. Benes in which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom recognised the Czecho-Slovak National Committee formed in Paris as qualified to representthe Czecho-Slovak peoples, and in particular to make arrangements for there constitution of the Czecho-Slovak army in France.2. For some time past Dr. Benes has been pressing for some further degreeof official recognition for the Czecho-Slovak action abroad, and preferably forthe recognition of a Provisional Government with a view to encouraging thepopulation in the Protectorate and in Slovakia, and to facilitating the controland organisation of Czecho-Slovak nationals abroad. He claims that actionabroad and resistance at home are hampered by our refusal to recognise the czecho-Slovak peoples as Allies in the same sense as the Polish, Dutch and norwegian peoples.3. Hitherto there have been the following arguments against according anyfurther recognition to the Czecho-Slovak action abroad : (a) Dr. Benes has not so far been able to secure unity among the Czechsand Slovaks abroad, and further consideration of his request has therefore been made expressly dependent upon such unity.(b) The influence of Dr. Benes, and the emigre politicians and soldiersassociated with him, in the Protectorate and in Slovakia is uncertain, and itwas not clear that recognition of a Provisional Government abroad would,in fact, strengthen pro-Allied sentiment and action in the Protectorate andin Slovakia.(c) Further recognition would have antagonised Hungary and possiblyoffended the Polish Government.(d) In the fluid situation in Central Europe which might emerge fromthe war it seemed undesirable to undertake any definite commitments at thisstage regarding the reconstitution of Czecho-Slovakia.(e) The French Government, with whom our action had to become-ordinated, were opposed to further recognition.(/) There was little doubt that the sympathies of the Czech people lay with the Allies, and no further degree of recognition seemed necessary toencourage them to resist the Germans.11094   [21458]
4. Recent developments have, however, altered the situation in the followingrespects :-- (a) French and Hungarian susceptibilities need no longer be considered.(b) German successes appear to have had such an influence upon theexisting Governments at Prague and Bratislava, and perhaps also upon the czech and Slovak populations, that some further gesture of encouragementmay now be required to strengthen their will to resist.(c) The possibility exists that, if we do not support Dr. Benes and his followers, Czechs and Slovaks may look solely to the Union of soviet socialist Republics for salvation.(d) Common adversity has brought the Poles and Czechs closer together and no opposition is likely from the Polish Government to a Czecho-SlovakProvisional Government.(e) The Czecho-Slovak cause is popular in the United States of Americaand the placing of the Czecho-Slovaks upon the same footing as the Poles,Norwegians, &amp;c, should have a good effect there.(/) The foregoing arguments probably outweigh the disadvantages of proceeding to a new political act in respect of Central Europe.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government are also now faced with practical problems arising out of the transfer of the headquarters of the Czecho-Slovak national committee from France to England and the evacuation to this country ofprobably the greater part of the Czecho-Slovak army and air force in France,amounting to several thousand men and a few hundred pilots. There should therefore be advantage in having in this country a Czecho-Slovak ProvisionalGovernment with the necessary authority to control the Czecho-Slovak soldiersand airmen and other civilian refugees. There is reason to believe that, ifDr. Benes were assured of further recognition, he would no longer have much difficulty in securing the necessary unity among the Czech and Slovak emigres.6. The Czecho-Slovak armed forces and refugees in this country willrequire financial assistance from His Majesty&apos;s Government. This problem willhave to be met whether further recognition is given to Dr. Benes or not, but an argument in favour of recognition is that this might enable the  7,000,000 ofgold belonging to the former Czecho-Slovak National Bank, which is at presentblocked in this country, to be used as security for any loan made to Dr. Benes.7. For the above reasons it is considered that the balance of advantage nowlies in favour of meeting Dr. Benes&apos;s request and informing him that, if he can secure the collaboration of the persons indicated by him in a recent communica-tion to the Foreign Office, His Maiesty&apos;s Government would be prepared toconsider giving recognition to a Czecho-Slovak Provisional Government soconstituted, on certain conditions which they would be prepared to discuss withhim when he can inform them that the necessary collaboration, has been achieved.Among such conditions would be-(a) a refusal to commit themselves to any specific frontiers for the futureCzecho-Slovak State;(b) a relinquishment on Dr. Benes&apos;s part of any claim to exerciselegislative authority over Czecho-Slovak nationals or property in thiscountry;(c) a satisfactory arrangement concerning the gold.Suitable arrangements would also have to be made regarding the Czecho-Slovaktroops and airmen in this country.H.Foreign Office, July 1, 1940.
