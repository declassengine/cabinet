TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.P.(G)(a.O)  155.17TH JUNE.  19h0. COPY NO,    /war CABINET.THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF A COMPLETEOR PARTIAL COLLAPSE OF FRENCH RESISTANCE.Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio.x&apos;  INTRODUCTORY.The present memorandum lias been prepared incompliance with the request of the War Cabinet(W.M.(kO) 162nd Conclusions, Minute 9) that we should submit an appreciation on the economic consequences ofthe German invasion of France on certain hypotheses,some of which have become obsolete by the march ofevents in the last U8 hours.     The hypotheses whichI have examined are the following: -(a) assuming the collapse, partial or total, of resistance to Germany in Western Europej(i) what are the economic consequences for Germany? *(ii) what are the direct losses to GreatBritain?(b) assuming the persistance of certainresistance in France what are our additionalliabilities in this connexion?(c) assuming that, with the assistance of thelocal administrations we are able toharness to our war effort the economic resources of the Colonial Empires of theNetherlands, Belgium, and France, what additional strength may we hope to securethereby?It must be understood that owing to great pressureunder which this document has been prepared some ofthe estimates involved may well be defective asstatements of fact, but they may certainly be accepted as giving the correct orders of magnitude involved.Moreover, many of the estimates are contingent uponcertain hypotheses regarding strategic contingencieswhich in existing circumstances are liable to rapidchange.     These estimates must therefore be regardedas provisional only0

2*      -A^-sspwai^&quot;memorarj.dwfl (Paper No. W0P0(UO) 209)is being submitted simultaneously on the last of theqiie&amp;tions on which a report was asked for, namely, theextent of the assistance in the economic sphere whichin the event of a French collapse we should requirefrom the United States, and the other American States,to enable us to carry on the war, and to bring about ,the defeat of Germany 0II.  THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OFTEE INVASIONS.(a) Germany.3.       Germany1s gains-from-invasion may be classifiedunder two headings:-(i) she has gained certain stocks;(ii) she has acquired control of certainsources of supply of food, raw materials and manufactured articles, includingmanufacturing capacity and man-power.4.       The chief gains in stocks - apart from actualmunitions - have been in respect of oil? certain metals,textile materials,, feeding stuffs, and fats.     Thefollowing table gives particulars of some of thesegains, so far as can be estimated at present:-TABLE .1cStocks of raw materials and foodstuffsin the&quot;-in-va^&amp;^o^irTe&amp;T^^&apos;&quot;(Thousands of metric tons)0Norway andDenmark0Netherlands.&amp; Belgium.France (north of the Somme)&apos;.Raw Materials.PetroleumOopperLead.TinNickelChrome oreWoolCottonCoal at minesPhosphate rock andsuperphosphate sUOOoOlloOlOcO1*32o020o02eiko59195oO150.06o530.02o2??I6o0k5 oO?I50o095*05o0?????9?800.0f&amp; These figures which rcpr-exab the position at thebeginning of the invasion arc to &quot;bo regarded asapproximate estimates only, and as subject to aconsiderable margin of error.     Some of these stocks have be r. destroyed by air action;    andto this extend %hc figures givon above, whicharo in any case maxima,- rare;vest a more substantialgain to the Germans than in fae/i has been secured.

The advantage gained through control of sources of continuous supply are more difficult to estimateeven than that gained through the acquisition of stocks.We may assume that Germany will appropriate the wholeof the present export surpluses for her own purposes and further that she will not recoil from forcing agreater surplus at the expense of the population ofthe occupied territories to the full extent to whichthis is practicable*     But we do not know how muchcapacity has been destroyed in the recent fighting, noris it easy to form an opinion of productivity in circumstances of what will be virtually slave labour.In certain cases where industries are dependent uponimported materials - textiles are an example - thefigures of recent export surpluses would exaggeratethe possible gaina     Thus, all that can be done is toindicate in general terms the more conspicuous gains.6*       There is some easing of the food situation for germany,     For the time being at least the dairy produce of Denmark and the Netherlands will be a welcomeaddition to her reserves? though because of the dependence of these industries on imported feeding-stuffsto which allusion is made below, this gain may beexpected to be only transitory.     It seems probable,moreover, that in the event of the total collapse of resistance in France, it might be possible for theGermans next year to squeeze something out of Frenchagriculture. This year, however, agricultural production in France has been so disorganisedthat the food situation there would be a liabilityrather than an asset0-3-

7. In the event of the total collapse of resistance inFrance the most conspicuous gain to Germany will be in theheavy industries, especially iron and steel;   for the Frenchsteel industry does not depend on foreign supplies of oresof&quot;the ordinary grades.     The export surplus of iron ore from Metropolitan France was in the neighbourhood of 15million metric tons;    and no doubt this could he increasedespecially if, as is probable, much internal demand for orehas been destroyed by the damage to plant, etc.     ThoughGermany is now in possession of ample resources of iron-oreof the-ordinary grades, this is not to say that she no longerhas any steel-making problem, since here the limiting factorwill be the supply of the ferro   alloys required for makingthe special grades of steel of particular importance in themanufacture of   aircraft and armaments.8. Through her occupation of Denmark and the Netherlands,Germany has acquired territories which, prior to the invasion,possessed a merchant shipbuilding capacity of about 500,000gross tons a year.     It is uncertain, however, to what extentshe has actually acquired this additional capacity in view ofthe damage done by air action, and in the case of theNetherlands in view also of deliberate demolitions,9. In Belgium and northern France, Germany has acquiredlarge quantities of industrial plant.     No doubt largequantities of this equipment has been destroyed or severely damaged as the consequence either of military and air operations or of demolitions.     On the other hand, even damagedequipment possesses the value that, given sufficient time,it is possible through the reduction of scrap to recover someof the rarer alloys of which Germany is in short supply.10.       Finally, it must be recognised that as a result of theinvasions more labour, both industrial and agricultural, isat Germany&apos;s disposal.     It would be a mistake to assess thetotal gains as being both the supply of products and thelabour which produces them.     But quite apart from theparticular gains already referred to, there exists thepossibility of using the skilled labour of the invadedcountries to remedy any bottlenecks in German industry.   &apos; Onthe other side, due weight must be given to the likelihood that, through the sullen attitude of the. workers, output per head in such circumstances will show a marked decline.11.       The gains secured by Germany must be discounted by theextent to which stocks and industrial plant have already, or may in the future be, destroyed by air action or sabotage.By the deep territorial advances which Germany- has made,industrial equipment in Germany itself may now be lessreadily accessible to air attack;   but this does not applyto similar equipment in the occupied territories, which provide equally important targets.     Here again it is notpossible at the moment to estimate the extent to which germany has already been deprived of such resources through

air action.     The destruction of stocks and standingcrops by air action, in so far as this is practicable,would also be of great value.12.       Moreover, even where destruction of productiveequipment is not possible, Germany&apos;s gains are not alllasting gains nor are they unaccompanied by certaincounter-balancing features.     The gains in the case of foodstuffs, for instance, are subject to the importantqualification that certain types of food products canonly be maintained by imports.     Thus, Danish andNetherland dairy products depend in large part upon a supply of imported feeding-stuffs.     If these are not forthcoming, there must be a progressive slaughter of animals when existing stocks are exhausted.Similarly, it is improbable that the supply of Danishbacon can be maintained for any considerable period.13*       Quite apart from the fact that much of the manufacturing capacity acquired by Germany has alreadybeen severely damaged in the course of the last fewweeks, it should be realised that some of that which isintact will be of comparatively little value, becausethe raw materials which it requires are not available or must be brought over long distances by routes whichare very much congested.     Norwegian aluminium plant,for example, is entirely dependent upon the importationof bauxite from the Mediterranean, and since Germanyalready has adequate plant to meet her own requirementsof aluminium she would be unlikely to devote railwaytrucks, which are already very scarce to the carriage of bauxite from Hungary and Yugoslavia to the Balticports for onward shipment to Norway.     In the same way,the zinc smelting works in Belgium will be of little value since Germany is already well provided with zinc.The textile industry of Northern Prance is, dependentupon imports of cotton and wool which will now be cut off.-14.       Perhaps the most important difficulty with which germany will be faced as a result of the invasion will bein regard to supplies of coal in the invaded countries and elsewhere0     Prance, the Netherlands, Denmark and norway were all importers of coal and so also was Italy;the aggregate import deficit for Europe as a whole is ofthe order of 30 million metric tons.     The absence ofsuch imports may be an embarrassment - how severe an embarrassment however depends upon the extent to whichcivil populate c:i c^iicemed may be made to suffer.

15.. In the case of petroleum the requirements of-military operations will obviously have the first call uponavailable supplies.    It is not possible, however, undermodern conditions to maintain the economic life of a civilian community without a certain expenditure ofpetroleum, no matter how far.the standard of life in that community may be depressed.    To this extent, therefore,the acquisition of the recently occupied territories mustadd to Germany&apos;s difficulties in the matter of petroleumsupplies..,:,16*- Finally, it should be noted that certain ofthe- countries invaded provided entrepots for trade withGermany.   Under the pressure of&apos; economic warfare, goodsgoing into Germany through these channels had been greatly reduced.   Assuming that we are able to continue this pressure, this trade will now be reduced to zero, and anyother trade with the outside world which might arise inthis way would be impossible.(b)     United Kingdom.1?* The direct effects on Great Britain of theinvasions fall clearly into two categories.   On the onehand, we suffer certain obvious losses.   Against these canonly be set certain advantages of much less importance andof a more contingent nature.18. Our obvious losses arise chiefly in regard to imports.    There are certain subsidiary losses in regard to exchange opportunities and business investments which arenot negligible;   bcrtrfor the purposes of this memorandumthey are left on one side.19. It would be a mistake to estimate our losses interms of our total imports from the-countries concerned.For some at least of these imports which constitute a hightotal in value, such as wood pulp and luxury textiles, areirrelevant to our war effort tf.    For the present purpose it is better to take the imports of foodstuffs, rawmaterials and the manufactures which play a reallyimportant part in the organisation of our war economy, andto set out the quantities which, but for the invasionswe   had hoped to obtained from   the countries   inff   Already since the invasion of Norway, imports ofwoodpulp had been cut and corresponding restrictions imposed on the consumption of newsprint and other formsof paper.   Similarly, as regards textiles, the allocations of raw materials for the home market were substantially reduced some two months ago, and the recent decision toreduce the home consumption, of non-essential goods should serve to secure further economies.

20.       The ,bm*ad. significanoe of these figures may he stated(a) As regards foodstuffs, we suffer considerably throughthe less of supplies of eggs, butter, margarine, andbacon0      To some extent it has been possible to re-place these from other sources,, but there may be serious shortages(i) Eggs;- The combined effect of the loss of ourchief foreign sources of supply and the slaughterof a large proportion of our own stock of poultrynecessitated by the shortage of feeding-stuffswill result in a serious shortage this autumn,,.....(ii) Butters- Supplies here will also be short owingto the difficulty of finding alternative sources of imports, but stocks are for the moment high.(iii). Margarine;- In view of our limited capacity forthe manufacture of margarine, the loss of the factories in the Netherlands renders our suppliessomewhat precarious for the time being.(iv) Bacon;- In the long period,  a serious shortagemust be expected, but for the moment relief willbe secured through increased quantities of home supplies resulting from the slaughter policyimposed upon us through the shortage of imported feeding-stiiffSc,      Moreover, stocks of importedbaccn are at the moment higho(b) As regards raw materials and manufactures,  the mostobvious losses are as follows?-(i) Iron Ore;- We have lost valuable supplies from sweden, while a large proportion of our imports,-including supplies which would have to some extentreplaced supplies from Sweden,  comes from french north Africa,,      If we now lose the latter supplies^the position will be very serious.(ii) Steel.-- Me were planning to obtain 750,000 tons from France, Belgium and the Netherlands out ofa total of 13730,000 tons from all countries.,The loss of alloy steel and certain ferro-alloysfrom Sweden must also be regarded as serious.These losses can only be made good from the UnitedStates0(iii) Timbers/    An important part of our supplies cameformerly from the Scandinavian countries, Y/hileFrance was an important source   of supply of pit-props.      The loss here is serious in that these supplies must be replaced largely by imports from canada, which involves considerable shippingdif f icultiest.(iv) Aluminium:- The position here, which was alreadyseriously stx ai ned, becomes still more difficult.Almost nine-tenths of our imports of bauxite wereto come from France.(v) Flaxs-   There is likely to be a serious positionof &quot;short supply!    about three-quarters of our imports came from Belgium and the Netherlands.

(yi) Calcium Carbicle :-   Supplies of this veryessential commodity are likely to he short;five-sixths of our imports were coming fromthe invaded countries.(e) In some measure what we have lost can be replacedfrom other sources - although at the cost of increased   pressure both on the available sources of supply and on our shipping resources.    In theeconomic sphere the main effect of the invasionshas been to bring the war much closer to our ownshores and ports, and by requiring diversion ofshipping to the West Coast ports, to reduce our capacity to import.(d)&quot;The reduction in importing capacity arises from anumb-er-of -complex causes.      In the first place,the fact that the ports available for handlingimports are fewer  in number must impose a heavy strain on the organisation of those ports.      Tothe extent of which these equipments of the portsis insufficient to secure the discharge of importson arrival, the diversion to West Coast portsimposes a definite reduction on our total import-ing capacity.      But this is not the only factor which may reduce our total Importing capacity,since this depends also on the ability of ourrail and road transport systems to carry importsafter discharge to their final destinations at separately which will prevent congestion arising in the ports.      The fact that for these reasons our ability to import goods is likely to be substan-tially reduced may make it desirable to bring inmanufactured goods rather than raw materials -for example, steel rather than iron ore.    this change must, of course, impose further strain onour resources of foreign exchange, and render allthe greater the need for credits from theUnited States.21.        Against the losses which we have suffered there areto be set certain counterbalancing features.      The extentof some of these depends on circumstances which it is not easy to predict :-(a) There will be some gains in shipping, though itis not yet possible to estimate them accurately;negotiations with the Belgian and NetherlandGovernments are still under way,  end the tonnagethat will come to us through agreements withthese Governments is still uncertain.      It islikely that, up to the time of the invasion of france  the French and ourselves had on balancesecured a small net advantage in the tonnage ofocean-going shipping available to carry imports into this country.      It is impossible at thisstage to estimate the extent to which we may beable to acquire control over the French mercantilemarine.     But, in any case, France was forced to rely to a considerable extent on British and time-chartered neutral shipping to bring in herimports,  end with her capitulation this par-ticulor strain will disappear;    it can hardly be doubted that for this reason alone our shipping difficulties should be considerably reduced.But in any case the limitation upon our importing capacity is likely in the future to be set   &apos;rather by handling capacity in the ports and

internal rail and road transport, than by thetonnage available.     ^ny increase in tonnage will,however, make it easier for us to obtain goods from more distant and cheaper sources.  -  We havealso obtained control over a large number of non-ocean-going vessels which can be used for coast-wise traffic;(b) Our gain in tanker tonnage has also been substantial,and has given us, in conjunction with the UnitedStates, an almost complete monopoly of the world&apos;stankers.      The tanker tonnage under our control isat present sufficient in relation to our import programme;(c) In the course of the invasions, such efforts as were possible were made to gain control overstocks belonging to the invaded countries;    andattempts were made also to remove machine tools.The extent to which these efforts were successfulcannot now be estimated, but it is likely thatthe totals involved were inconsiderable.      Inany case,  the advantage gained is only relevant to the very short period;(d) Efforts have been made to bring to this countrycertain skilled workers, such as seamen formanning captured ships;    and some success was achieved in the case of Norwegian and Danishpersonnel.      An attempt was also made recentlyto transfer skilled Belgian and French engineersto this country,      In the circumstances, thenumbers involved are probably small;(e) Complete, figures are not available regarding theextent&apos; to which the invaded countries were ableto p ]ace their financial assets in safety;    asregards gold,  the main part of the reserves of norway were removed, to this country, while the reserves of Denmark which were quite small fellinto the hands of the Germans.     A substantial part of the Netherland reserve was removed eitherprior to or at the time of the invasion;    activesteps are now being token to place the Frenchreserve beyond the reach of the Germans;    similarly,such steps as are immediately practicable arebeing taken to place in safety France&apos;snegotiable securities;    to what extent these may become available to support the british war effort must depend upon the course ofevents, more particularly in the case of gold and securities deposited in the United States;the total of these resources is undoubtedlyvery large;(f) Finally, on the assumption that we are able toexercise economic control over the colonialempires of the invaded States, it is clearthat gains both of a direct and indirectcharacter are possible H.35 This question is discussed in Section IV of thepresent document.

III. OUR LIABILITIES TO FRANCE,22*       The extent of the additional strain upon our economic resources is by no means limited to the direct losses notedabovei At the t&amp;ne that the present appreciation was asked for,it was desired that the probable effects on our economyshould be examined on the following hypotheses in regardto the continuance of resistance by France:-(a) that a line was established which would offer effective resistance;(b) that resistance was confined to guerrillawarfare in isolated areas;(c) that resistance in metropolitan Francecollapsed but that the seat of FrenchGovernment was transferred to North africa and resistance      3 continued with the aid of the French Fleet;(d) that the French Government capitulatedo23.        If the French had been able to re-establish a line,it is clear that apart from certain commodities which wouldhave had to come from the United Statess we should have tosupply France with almost all the raw materials and manufactures she needs.    For her own capacity for producingcoal, steel., aluminium, textiles, leather? and a largenumber of other commodities, would have been almostnegligible.   How much of her manufacturing capacity for munitions would have been left to her was not certain; but,as the result of bombing and demolitions, her contribution would have been slight,,    In the case of food, she wouldprobably have been about self-sufficings since the areasthen invaded were largely food-importing regions, while those left had usually an export surplus.    The presence oflarge numbers of refugees would, however, have placed aconsiderable strain on food supplies and have made itnecessary to provide some essential food stuffs.24.       Although it was impossible to assess the magnitude of France1s need for materials and manufactures,  an upper limit was clearly set by capacity of the ports which wereavailable.    Thus,  If the French had been able to hold theBrittany and Atlantic ports (i0e. from St3 Malo to Bordeaux),the total importing capacity would have been about1,400,000 tons of coal and 700,000 tons of othermerchandise (excluding oil) per month.    It must be emphasised that these were maximum figures,  as bombingwould certainly have reduced the degree to which this capacity could be used,25.       On the assumption of guerrilla warfare,  the chief and perhaps the only military need, would be to supplysmall arms and ammunition, the amount of which cannotbe estimated.    If it had been found possible for allied forces to maintain some form of resistance betweenSt. Malo to St. Nazaire,  the civilian population would

have had to he maintained by supplies drawn largely fromthis country     It is impossible to indicate with any confidence the numbers involved, since a rapid re-distribution Of civilian population has been going on.In 1936, the three Departments, Morbihan, Cotes du Nord andFinisterre Contained about 2 million persons0    Refugees maywell, have increased this total to 4 or 5 million persons,,The principal deficiencies of this region would be coal, ofwhich 4/5,000,000&apos; tons per annum might be required; wheat tothe extent of 7003000 tons and sugar to the extent of.70s000tons.    In addition^ quantities of cotton and woollen clothingwould have to be provided for the civilian population26.       If resistance in metropolitan France collapsed, but the seat of the French Government were transferred to North africa and resistance were continued with the aid of the French fleet and African armies,  the aid that we should be called upon tocontribute would be limited chiefly to military and airequipmento    But some consignments of food, clothing, andfootwear would probably also be necessary, the amountbeing dependent on the number of the population (militaryand civil) affectedo27,       If the French Government capitulates,  it is clear thatno supplies must be provided from this country     On thecontrary, however repugnant that course,  every effort must bemade to prevent supplies even of food from reaching thecountry, since the effect would be to release agricultural and other labour for use by Germany in support of her war effort, and to diminish the administrative difficulties withwhich she would otherwise be faced.    Any proposals whichmight be made on humanitarian grounds for the relief of distress in the occupied territories would be open to strong objection both on these grounds and because there could beno guarantee that such supplies would in fact reach thepeople for whom they were intended.IVe    THE RESOURCES OF THE COLONIALEMPIRES OF THE INVADED COUNTRIES.28.       Before the war,  the Colonial possessions of belgium and the Netherlands supplied Germany directly with 2-g- per cent by value of her imports..    This may understate the totaldependence on these Empires since there were probably indirectimports through the metropolitan areas0    But it is impossibleto obtain an exact measure of these0   As from the outbreak ofwar even those imports were stopped by the operation of theBritish Contraband Control,,    The alliance of the Belgian andNetherland Empires with the United Kingdom and Prance has there fore not deprived Germany of any important supplies she had been receiving since the war from these Empires,,    We are,however, now able to use the resources of the Belgian andNetherland colonies without regard to foreign exchangeconsiderations.29.       The colonies of the three empires are situated in central America, north and central Africa,  and the Near and far Easto    The Belgian possessions comprise the Belgian Congewith a population of 10 millions and the mandated territories of Ruanda - Urundio    The Netherland Empire consists of the netherland East Indies, with a population of 70 millions, andtwo colonies of Surinam and Curacao in central America,,    Thecolonies and dependencies of France include Algeria,- Tunis,Morocco, and Syria within the Mediterranean area, French WestAfrica, French Equatorial Africa, Somaliland and Madagascar in africa, French Indo-China in the Far East, and French Guianain South America0    Except for the French possessions in theMediterranean to which access will certainly be difficult andmay become impossible,  all these colonies lie outside thetheatres of war0

30,       The resources of these colonies consist almostentirely of- foodstuffs and of raw materials0   No manufacturing capacity on a large scale exists in any of the colonies,which cannot therefore he expected to provide manufacturedmunitions of war0     They are, however, capable of exportinglarge quantities of food such as sugar, tea, maize and riceand of materials such as rubber, tin, copper, hardwoods,and petroleum, which will be essential for the success ofour war effort as supplements to the produce of our ownEmpire,31.       Since these colonies are mainly agricultural, theydo not depend to a large extent on imports from abroad, andit should be possible, without causing serious hardship tothe population, to draw on their resources without in turndiverting essential capacity in this country to supply them.It trhould, however, be remembered that there are practicallimits to the use of the resources of these Empiresexclusively in support of our war effort:-(a) It is unlikely that the French possessions inthe Yves tern Mediterranean will be able tosupply the quantities of food and materials which they have exported to Prance and ourselvesSince the war began.(b) The trade of Syria with Turkey and the surround-ing countries must, for political reasons becontinued, if this is at all possible.(e )    The economic -relations between Japan and theMotherland-7v.ct Indies are very close, and eachdepends-fi-eatly upon whatvean be obtained fromthe other    For this&quot; reason, therefore, and also because of the urgent need for avoiding&apos; trouble in the Far East, it is extremely desirable that asubstantial trade between them should be allowedto continue,,(d)    The Netherla-nd East Indies have a trade with, theUnited States of America, which is of decisiveimportance for--tfee-e-cq,riomy of the Archipelago.It is moreover, vital from a political point ofview that the territories should continue tosupply essential raw materials to the UnitedStates.32. The following table gives (a) the total values of exports from these Empires and (b) quantities of the moreimportant commodities in their respective export lists:-

France had intended to import maize, rice,  ground nuts, sugar, and oilseeds in large quantities from her Colonies,35.       Since a substantially reduced programme for importsof food to this country is now being prepared, the additional supplies of foodstuffs now available from the Belgian andNetherland Empires are of importance mainly in allowing a diversion of purchases to these territories in order to saveforeign exchange reserves or to permit exports to countries such as the United States.    The opportunities for increasingexports of agricultural products from French, Belgian, andNetherland Colonies are considerable.(b) Raw Materials.36.       According to the programme of the Ministry of Supplydrawn up after the German occupation of Scandinavia, but before the invasion of the Low Countries and France and before the entry of Italy into the war, we had planned to import iron ore from French North Africa, molasses,  rubber,kapok and copal from the Netherland East Indies, and copperfrom the Belgian Congo.    France expected to import tin, rubber and copal from the Netherland East Indies and copper from theBelgian Congo.    From her own Empire, France had expectedsupplies of rubber, tin,  nickel, lead, wolfram and timber.37.       There is now no need, however, to restrict importsfrom Belgian and Netherland Colonies.    Our policy should beto divert our purchases to those territories, instead ofaway from them, as hitherto.    We should also draw upon thoseresources of the French Empire which may still be available:-(i) Popper: the Belgian Congo supplies should be diverted to this country since shipments to belgium and France are no longer possible;(il) Bauxite: the loss of bauxite supplies from thesouth of France to Great Britain necessitatesthe diversion of our purchases to british guiana; there are also large quantities of. Bauxite&apos; in Surinam and in the Netherland east indies available for shipment to this country or to the United States, Canada,  or to Australia;(iii) Tin Ore:    the Netherland East Indies produces 17-g-per cent, of the world output of tin ore, theBelgian Congo 5.6 per cent,  and French Indo-Chinaa further 1. per cent,  of the world output;    thesupply of tin available to us is now more thanample, and it will be possible to export largequantities to the United States;

(iv) Manganese Ore;,    French Morocco exported most ofits output&quot;&quot;to France; there are small quantitiesavailable in the Belgian Congo and the NetherlandEast Indies0(v) Nickel arid. Chrome Ore/.    French requirements ofnickel and. chrome ore were met by exports from new Caledonia; these supplies are outside theimmediate danger of war and could now be drawn upon by us;(vi) Rubbers    the Netherland East Indies produce onethird of the total world supply of rubber;    since we have already sufficient stocks of rubber,N^therland supplies can continue to be exported to the United States.38.        Steps have already been taken to ensure the safety ofthe oil refineries in the Netherland West Indies, which havesupplied 30 per cento  of the imports of petroleum productsinto Great Britain since the war.    The Netherland East Indiesalso refines oil and exports petroleum to this country,39. -     There are certain advantages which may be drawn fromthe control of the exports from these territories, in so faras we can achieve this with the aid of the local administrations.(a) As the result of increased control over raw materialsupplies the maintenance of inter-Alliedregulations at the source has become a consider-ably more powerful instrument of economic warfare and will be of great assistance in our negotiationswith the UoSoSoR.  and Japan,(b) In the years before the war,  the Netherland east indies had become one of the most importantsuppliers of essential foodstuffs and materials to the United States^    The United States took in1938 one third, of exports of palm oil from these territories, half of the exports of tapiocaproducts,  one third of the exports of rubber,together with large quantities of pepper, coffeeand teao    In so far as we do not ourselves requirethese products for our war effort but are able tocontrol their disposal,  we should do everything possible to further their export to the UnitedStates,,    In 1939, the value of imports from the netherland East Indies into the United States was93 million dollars, and the exports from theUnited States to the Netherland East Indies 35million dollars.    This credit surplus on thetrade between the Netherland East Indies and theUnited States is one of the most important assetsaccruing to the United. Kingdom from the invasion of the Low Countries.

V. - SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS.The conclusions emerging from the foregoing analysismay be summarised as follows:-(a) The principal losses and gains in the economic sphere (1) to Germany and (2) to ourselves as theresult of the German invasion of Norway, Denmark,the Netherlands, Belgium and France are thefollowing:(A) Germany-(l) Germany has acquired:-(i ) certain stocks,  of which (apart from munitions of war) the most important arethose of oil; certain metals, textilematerials, feeding stuffs and fats; while these are in some cases considerable, theyare probably in no case so great as to relieve Germany of further anxiety witnregard to a material of which an acute shortage was previously to be feared;(ii)  the opportunity to secure any surplus ofthe current output of these countries; ofsuch gains, by far the most important islikely to be the acquisition of the Lorraineiron ore beds;    the immediate value ofthese to Germany will depend upon how far the power stations and other equipmentnecessary to work them remains intact;(iii) a temporary gain of meat and animal products and of dairy produce; the extent of this wOldepend upon Germany&apos;s power to obtainfeeding stuffs, which Denmark and theNetherlands have largely imported fromabroad;    if, as  appears likely,  these arenot forthcoming, the gain will essentiallybe short-lived.(iv) a large accession of productive capacity:The utility of this depends on:-(a) the extent to which it has alreadysuffered in the military operations of the last few weeks or fromdemolitions, or may suffer from air action in the future;(b) the extent to which raw materials and labour are available;(c) the limitations imposed by consider-ations of internal transport.(2) Germany has added to her difficulties in twodirections:-(i) It has become necessary for Germany tomake provision, on however meagre a standard, of goods and foodstuffs of which her own supplies are limited to theinvaded comitrljswhere these have previouslydepended on imports from other than Germansources.

(ii) By losing the fringe of surroundingneutrals Germany has lost heropportunities of direct.!;&apos; and indirectly circumventing our blockade.(B) United Kingdom.- The economic effects upon the United kingdom are less easy to estimate than those on Germany,but among the principal are the following:-(l)    The United Kingdom has lost certain near and important sources of supplies(a) food imports, more particularly dairyand pig products, condensed milk and margarine;(b) timber, of which the supply position was already very difficult;(c) flax5. for which it will be verydifficult to find an alternative source;(d) iron ore; the loss of North african and Spani-sh supplies will greatly increase the difficulty of working ourfurnaces at their full capacity;(2)    The main effect in the economic sphere hasbeen to bring the war much closer to our ownshores and ports and, by requiring requiringdiversion to the west coast ports,substantially to reduce our probable capacity to import;(3)    for this reason,  any gain that we maysecure in ocean-going shipping, by seizingor bringing into our use more neutral tonnage than was formerly at our disposal,can probably serve&apos; only to increase our capacity to bring goods from a distance;our reduced importing capacity makes it increasing necessary to bring in goodsin manufactured forms in which they canmore easily be handled, and throwstherefore an increased stoain upon our resources of foreign purchasing power;thus the need for financial help, inparticular for help from the United States,has become more urgent;(4)    our losses may be somewhat mitigated by thepossibility that substantial assets, in theform of gold or negotiable securitiesformerly belonging to the invaded powers,may become available for our use;    but onthe scale on which our needs are nowdeveloping;,  assistance will almost certainly be necessary if we are to obtain from dollar and other hard currency countries the physical resources necessary    to prosecute a successful war;(b). if France had been able to maintain some form of militaryresistance in her metropolitan territory or is still ableto do so from her North African territories, her

dependence on us for various forms of assistance will&quot;be much, greater than hitherto;    the amount of svchaidwould vary according to the amount of the resistanceshe could offer:-(i) if the French Army had been able to establish a shorter line in the south or the south-west, she would have had to be supplied from outside withalmost all her needs of coal, steel, aluminium,textiles and leather, or in view of the loss of hermanufacturing capacity more probably withmanufactured munitions;    she has lost also importantfood producing areas, and if large numbers of refugees were crowded into the remaining French area,food would have needed to be imported on a larger scale;(ii) if the French are able to maintain isolatedresistance or local guerilla warfare, her demands on us will be much less, and will be mainly food,coal and textiles, in addition to small arms andammunition;(iii) if resistance in metropolitan France collapses,but the seat of the French Government is transferredto North Africa, and resistance is continued withthe aid of the French fleet and such resources as can be supplied from outside, the aid that we shouldbe called upon to provide would be similar to thatcontemplated in (i) above;finally, if French resistance collapses everwhere, weshould provide no supplies of any kind to the portions ofFrench territory occupied by Germany;    however repugnantsuch a course, it will be our imperative duty to preventsupplies from reaching these areas, since the effect would beto release agricultural and other labour for use by germany in support of her war effort, and to diminish theadministrative difficulties with which she would otherwise be faced.(c) the resources of the Netherland, Belgian, and French colonialempires represent an important asset of which we shouldmake the fullest possible use in the support of our war effort, notwithstanding any composition which theMetropolitan Governments may make with Germany;    the produce of these territories can to some extent be useddirectly for our own purposes, in particular some of theBelgian copper and of the rubber from the NetherlandBast Indies;    their chief importance lies in their largeexports to other countries, in particular to the UnitedStates, and in the resources in difficult currencies that wecan thus secure;    in addition, as the result of ourincreased control over raw material supplies, themaintenance of inter-allied regulation at the source hasbeoome a considerably more powerful instrument ofeoonomic warfare, and v/ill be of considerable assistancein our negotiations with the U.S.S.R.   and Japan.(Initialled)      A.G.Tr e asury^Chamber s, S.W.1.
