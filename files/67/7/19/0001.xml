EJLR E -X*COPY NO. / /WAR   CABINET.AIR RAID WARNINGS.Joint Memorandum by the Minister. without Portfolio andthe Minister of Home Security.1,      When the intensity of night raiding by the enemy increased at the beginning of last week, large parts of the country were under air raid ^red) warning for substantial periods and it was represented that this interfered unduly with production.     Apolicy of withholding such warnings was followed later in theweek, and this in its turn had the result that enemy aircraft were assisted in identifying their targets by outside lightingwhich would have been extinguished had a warning been given and anumber of bombs were dropped without previous warning.     This led to considerable feeling among employers and workpeople, involving insome cases threats to suspend night work.2.      It is clearly desirable that the air raid warning system shouldbe operated In such a way as -(a) to produce the least possible interference with production as night and with the- night&apos;s sleep of day workers;    andat the same time(b) to preserve the existing arrangements by which permittedexternal lighting (on railways and docks and in important industrial establishments) is extinguished before it can beof directional assistance to enemy aircraft, and the civil defence services are mobilised in readiness for action.3..     To secure the purposes set out in paragraph (b) above it isessential that the air raid (red) warning should bo retained.     Subjectto what is said in paragraph 6 below, this necessarily involves thesounding of the public warning, but in order to minimise interferencewith production, it is suggested that the present practice should be modified in t?ra respects.4.      First, it is proposed that the Air Officer Commanding in Chief,Fighter Command, shall limit the air raid (red) warning, so far aspossible, to places where severe or sustained attack is expected.Secondly, the workers in factories working st night should be informer!that in order to defeat the enemy&apos;s efforts to dislocate production,they should continue at work, even though an air raid warning has beengivei&quot;^ and should not go to shelter until they actually hear tho soundof bombs or gun fire.5*      These proposals will not necessitate any modification of thoadvice already given to the general public, i.e. that they should seekshelter on hearing the air raid warning signal.6-      The question whether it is practicable to institute a modificationof the warning system under which a special warning, not involving the giving of a public warning, would bo issued to the railways, docks andother establishments which have external lighting, is being examined indetail.     Until such an alternative system can ho substituted, it is^commended that the procedure should be as set out in paragraph 4 above
