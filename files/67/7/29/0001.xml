In my capacity as Chairman of the Civil DefenceCommittee, I circulate herewith, for consideration bythe War Cabinet, a memorandum by Mr. Geoffrey Shakespeareon the future of the Children&apos;s Overseas Reception Scheme.I agree with the conclusions indicated in thismemorandum;   but I think that in any public statement which may be made the attitude of the Government towardsthe evacuation of children under   private arrangements should be stated in a manner which gives due weight tothe importance of avoiding even the appearance of classdiscrimination in a matter of this kind.J.A.MINISTRY OF HOME SECURITY.2th July,, 19,40.fl B C RE T.

MEMORANDUM by the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the dominions on the future of the CHILDREN;S OVERSEAS RECEPTION SCHEME.1.   On July 6th the War Cabinet decided that no children should besent to North America under the Children&apos;s Overseas Reception Scheme inunescorted ships and that in the meantime the scheme should be held in abeyance.     It is understood that this decision was meant to govern anyships carrying children to any Dominion under the Scheme.The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Shipping were asked to consider the possible use of slower ships in normal convoys,2.   Discussions subsequently took place between representatives of theAdmiralty, the Ministry of Shipping and the Children&apos;s Overseas ReceptionBoard.     It was agreed that no fast ships should go in slow convoys.   it transpired that there are only two slow passenger ships available on theNorth Atlantic route up to August 11th and one of these has since beenrequisitioned for other purposes.     This, in effect, means that only 150children can go to North America up to August llth0. 3.   In view of the insignificance of these figures no alternativesremains but to put the Scheme in abeyance.     When the scheme was submitted tothe War Cabinet on June 17th, the French Army was intact and the Prench fleet was co-operating with us everywhere;   the German Air Force was not as freethen to make continuous raids on this country,,     The situation has nowradically changed and the whole scheme. should I urge be reviewed in the lightof the changed conditions which involve questions of national security.Adequate naval protection which might have been afforded a few weeks ago is: I am informed now impossiblea    naval forces must be used for more vitalpurposes than escorting ships carrying children overseas.40   If the decision to put the scheme into abeyance is announced, thedisappointment in the Dominions, the U.S.A0 and among parents in this country must not be minimised,,5..   The continual publicity given to the possibility of invasion in thePress and the B.B0C0 for weeks before the French Army capitulated created ananxiety in Great Britain which was reflected in the immediate response fromparents -when the Government scheme was announced.     This was the mood of theCountry with which we were faced at the outset of administering the Scheme.6.   From the start, every attempt has been made to damp down the response Jfrom parents.     This was done by a Statement to the Press oh June 20th, the dayof the Schemes s inauguration; by a Broadcast on June 23rd &quot;when the grave risks of the voyage were emphasised;   and subsequently in the Parliamentary debate on July 2nd when it was made clear that only a very small, proportion ofchildren could ever avail themselves of the scheme in view of the limited number of offers and the shipping facilities available.     The Lord Privy Sealfurther qualified &quot;the shipping facilities&quot; by referring not only to the passenger ships but to the naval escorts necessary to protect them.    Finally,it was announced on July 5th that no further applications could be entertained.7,   It is estimated that, in spite of these efforts, applicationscovering 120,000 children at Grant-aided Schools in England and Wales and16,000 children at other Schools have been received to date.     In addition theScottish figures cover some 25,000 children.     It is anticipated that there mayhe a further 50,000 children covered by applications from Local EducationAuthorities in respect of children whose parents applied before the lists were closed.    We may therefore have to deal with a total of over 200,000 children,8,   Against this response the Dominions have offered 20,000 places andmany spokesmen for the Dominions have emphasised in public that these figures are only a beginning.     Moreoverp it is anticipated that the U.S.A, will asa minimum very shortly offer to receive 50,000 of our children.
&apos; ...9o- - If, therefore, 70 ;&apos;000. places are offered as a beginning itwould be idle to attempt to satisfy applications in respect of 200,000children by providing facilities in slow escorted passenger.ships at therate of a few hundred a month   Even if 500 berths a month were assured -and these are not assured - it would take 12. years befibrethe 70,000homes-could be filledo ..&quot;.&apos;-&apos;10*   In      opinion it could only aggravate the difficulties if thescheme wex-e proceeded with on this basiso     I-suggest that it is much&quot;better&apos; to face criticism now. than to allow -the--dominions and the U.S.Aoto launch appeals for fundss to select homes and to make all the necessary-reception arrangements only to find that a fraction of 1% of the offerscan &quot;be taken advantage of forthwitho. llo   If these vieisgare accepted^ the reason forthe change.&quot;in policy must he stated &quot;by the highest authority and on: the Vifest grounds?

-nftAffP QUESTION AND ANSWER.Question;   To ask the Lord Privy Seal whether it is possible to give naval protection to all ships carrying children under the Children&apos;s OverseasReception Scheme.Answer:   In the present circumstances our naval forces are required for the prosecution of the war, for the protection of this country and british territories overseas and for the safeguarding of our Trade Routes.   It has,therefore, been decided to devote all our naval forces to these essentialpurposes*The operation of the Children&apos;s Overseas Reception Scheme must of necessity be governed by these more vital considerations.   Hi the near future,therefore, no children will be sent overseas under the scheme as it cannot before seen when it will be possible for naval protection to be provided for the fast passenger ships which would be necessary.   Tn the ordinary way fastliners are not escorted and individuals travelling in them go at their ownrisk.   But the Government has considered it essential that no children should go under the Government scheme unless naval protection can be providedoWhen the scheme was announced on June 20th the situation was not comparable with that existing to-day.   Then the Prench army was still intactand the French fleet was co-operating with us on every ocean.   During thelast three weeks the situation has radically altered.   The demands made uponthe naval forces -since the scheme was announced have been increased to an extent which could not have been anticipated.His Majesty1 s Government have no alternative but to hold the scheme in abeyance.   It will only be possible to review the situation in the lightof a naval appreciation at a later date.   It is deeply regretted if thisdecision causes disappointment to parents, but they will be the first to appreciate the necessity for all precautions.    I am confident that those whohave made such generous offers in the Dominions and the United States ofAmerioa will equally understand the position.In conformity with this decision the arrangement whereby Schoolscan. go to Canada outside the Government scheme must also remain in abeyance.His Majesty&apos;s Government have, therefore, decided that as fromno further Permits will be issued in respect of individualchildren or school parties proceeding overseas outside the Government scheme.The only exception will be in respect of children of Dominion nationalsreturning home.
