Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1940.SECRET.W.P. (G.) (40) 187.July 16, 1940.WAR CABINET.ALIENS.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.AT its meeting on the 11th inst. the War Cabinet invited the Lord privy seal after consultation with the other Ministers concerned to submit to theCabinet suggestions for dealing with conditions in internment camps and inparticular with the question of finding suitable employment for internees. Atthe present time the responsibility for dealing with internees is divided betweenthe War Office and the Home Office. These are essentially departments concernedwith security. It is their primary duty to see that aliens who are or might be dangerous are not left at large.It appears to me that the question of aliens in this country involves morefar-reaching considerations.There are in this country at the present time a number of foreign Govern-ments of countries which have been overrun by Germany. There are also lessformal committees such as that connected with General de Gaulle. These bodies are necessarily in formal relation to the Foreign Office on the civil side and to theService departments on the military side.There are also a number of citizens of enemy origin, the great majority ofwhom are violently opposed to our common enemy. The civilian nationals ofconquered countries are necessarily the concern of a number of departmentsincluding the Security Services and the Ministry of Labour.The problem with which we have to deal has its negative and positive aspects.The former necessarily entails that in any case of doubt there should be a bias infavour of national security, i.e., that every doubtful alien, whether of enemy,allied or neutral origin should be put in a position where he or she cannot doharm.The latter aspect is equally important. In a war of ideals every effort shouldbe made to enlist on our side all those who are opposed to Nazism and to utilisetheir services to the full against the common enemy.Public opinion is apt to swing violently from the negative to the positiveaspect. Sympathy with refugees may lead to dangerous laxity. Excessive fearof enemy activities may lead to the loss of valuable services and to a crippling ofthe offensive inside occupied Europe, which should be a major operation in this war.Aliens in this country may be divided into the following categories : (a) Those who are dangerous.   These should be interned and if possibledeported. There may be among these persons who have beennaturalised in recent years.(b) Citizens of neutral countries such as the United States for whom no special provision is needed.(c) Aliens who are neither useful nor dangerous, such as the aged, and thechildren who only need care.[21530]Copy No.     &apos;

A.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,July 16, 1940.(1) Those of military age who should be either in their own national forces or in a foreign legion.(2) Those possessed of definite industrial or agricultural skill who should be absorbed into industry. The Minister of Labour has,I understand, under consideration the formation of an Inter-national Labour Force.(3) Persons of no special qualifications who are difficult to fit into industry, such as black-coated workers. These should be put to work of some kind.   Idleness is dangerous.(4) Persons of high technical or scientific qualifications whose services should be utilised.(5) Persons whose literary qualifications or political affinities make them potentially useful for work against the Nazis.The problem of sorting out aliens into their various categories and finding thebest way for utilising their services is not work appropriate to the Home office or the Fighting Services. It should, in my view, be entrusted to a specialorganisation.The duties of this organisation would be:  (a) To be in liaison with the various Governments or national Committees.(b) To be in liaison with the various voluntary organisations dealing withrefugees.(c) To work in close connection with the security services and with theMinistry of Labour and any other bodies dealing with the employmentof aliens. -(d) To provide for the welfare of aliens in concentration camps except thoseassigned to dangerous aliens which should&apos; continue to be under-military control.(e) Subject to the representations of the security services, to review all aliensin Category C and any aliens in Category B on whose behalfrepresentations are made, and recommend to the Home Office what should be done with them.(/) To endeavour to find suitable work for all those capable of it. A Sub-Committee might deal with this aspect.(g) To endeavour to maintain the morale of aliens in this country so as to bind them more closely to the common cause.I suggest that a strong Committee should be set up in order to give confidence to the country and to the aliens. The Chairman might be a Parliamentariansuch as Lord Cranborne, with a non-Parliamentarian, such as Sir FrancisHumphrys or Sir Herbert Emerson, as Vice-Chairman.Members suggested :
