Question:        To ask the Lord Privy Seal whether he can give any further information about the progressof the Children5s Overseas Reception Scheme.Answer;    Yes, Sir0      The House has already been made aware of the extremely generous offers for the reception andmaintenance of British children during the war that havebeen made from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Unionof South Africa, and also from the United States ofAmericao      These offers were already sufficient to account for a very substantial number of children,  and Ihave no doubt that they by no means indicate the limit ofthe hospitality which might ultimately be made availableoverseas.As regards the response in this country the numberof children for whom applications were made exceeded thet  /./,,        number for whom had been offered.      The$ulw        Government would have no difficulty in providing theshipping required for the children thus offeredhospitality as sufficient tonnage could be made avialable.On the other hand, the Government feel strongly theresponsibility that rests upon them to see that anychildren who go overseas under the Government scheme should have such naval protection as would reasonablyensure the safety of their passage during the voyage,The fate of the Arandora Star shows that even a fastpassenger vessel cannot always rely   for safety on herspeed if she is unescorted,,Unfortunately a radical change in the situationsince applications were first invited has occurred asa result of the loss of the services of a large part ofthe French Fleets    In present circumstances it isessential to concentrate our whole naval forces on thetask of meeting the overriding demands of national security.      It is this consideration   alone which hasforced the Government reluctantly to the conclusion thatthey must postpone the operation of the scheme for the transference of children overseas until the situation at sea enables them to provide naval escort for the shipsemployed for this purpose*Similarly, the Government feel that there must be a postponement of the special arrangements which they wereprepared to make in cases where schools here had planned to transfer pupHs to schools in Canada.Ordinary fast passenger vessels are not escorted andif children are carried on such vessels outside any government Scheme the responsibility for any ?iskson the voyage would not be on the Government.      In anycase, the number of such children must be limited since i am bound to repeat that the imperative necessity ofconserving our dollar resources to meet other essentialdemands makes it impossible to allow the remittance of funds in any form for the purpose of their maintenance in Canada and the United States of Americao

The Government realise that the postponement oftheir scheme, although inevitable,, is bound, to cause great disappointment among parents here, and also amongst thosewho in the Dominions have so wholeheartedly co-operated in making preparations for the reception and maintenanceof the children,,      I desire to assure them that vire keenlyappreciate their generosity and deeply regret the incon-venience which the postponement of our scheme is bound to cause them -:To those also in the United States of America whohave spared no effort to find a home for British children,I would like to express on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment our warmest thanks0      I hope that our scheme is onlytemporarily suspended and that we may yet be able to takeadvantage of that   -.7.;^- rehear ted hospitality so spontaneouslyand readily offeredo
