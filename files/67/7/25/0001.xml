Treatment of French Nationals in this countryin the event of war with France.Report of the Aliens Advisory Committee.The Aliens Advisory Committee met on the 6th July toconsider -what steps should be taken as regards French civilians in this country in the event of the French Government declaring war on us.Steps are being taken by the Home Secretary to revoke theOrders which accord1 privileged treatment to French citizens inthis country and French citizens   will, on the revocation ofthese Orders, he in the same position as   other non-enemy aliens, that is to say, they will be subject to the samerestrictions as other non-enemy aliens.    These restrictionsinclude, inter alia, the- curfew restrictions and therestrictions which prohibit aliens from entering into orresiding in Aliens Protected Areas without the permission ofthe police.In the event of war with France, French nationals would automatically become enemy aliens, and. would be subject to thespecial restrictions applicable to enemy aliens imposed byArticles 6A and 9A of the Aliens -Order., 1920 which, inter alia,impose restrictions on freedom of movement,&apos; and prohibit the possession of certain, articles .guch as cameras, telescopes, etc.,without the permission of the police.The Aliens Advisory Committee considered whether it was desirable that certain categories of.  French nationals should be automatically interned in the event of war with France, but theCommittee .were unable to recommend any criterion for selectingcategories of persons for internment.    The Committee, however,agreed that certain further measures of control would benecessary in the event of war with France, and they recommendthat the following, additional steps    should be.taken:-   . 1.     That lists should be. prepared of French-nationals who,on account of their knowledge of British plans, and preparations,.or in view of their technical skill,should not be allowed to return to France in any circumstances.    Those of them who are unreliable shouldbe detained in custody.2.     That, as regards the remainder, arrangements shouldbe made-to,repatriate to France any French citizen whoexpressed a desire to return home.    No person would beallowed to leave the country under this procedure unless he was in possession of an exit permit, and this would afford an opportunity to.the Security Services to decide whether there was any objection on security grounds tothe departure of individual applicants.3.     That the Minister of Labour and National Service shouldmake an Order requiring all French nationals in thiscountry to register for. national - serviceAny person whoso registers would be allowed to remain in this countryunless in any particular case there, were, some grounds to doubt his loyalty, when he would be either deported ordetained in custody.    Any French national who refused tocomply with the Order to register would likewise bedeported or detained in custody..IHQME OFFICE. ..        (Signed) F.A.

3&quot; 400^%&quot;Poisons&quot; has little meaningT^&apos;Many Articles would, we feel,.jt*rhe more appropriately lahmled as - Caution, Do not exceed thedose - or Poisonous,j061 to he takem- and sold by the large body of general traders and thus prevent public inconvenience.It is noted that the Articles in the 1908 Act, section, are suggested to be placed ion Schedule (l) of the 1903 Act,and thusrgive a further monopoly right of sale to RegisteredChemists. Jp;-       The above (1908) Jjfbtuse was inserted to enablehouseholders, traders,, agriculturalists and the large number-of commercial users ofthis article to obtain their supplieseasily and sufficiently, providing safeguarded regulations wereinstituted and carried out.      There is no substantial evidencethat traders selling these articles have not./gj^l^ully carriedout their duties^hence it would be obvio^Siy unfair that theright of sales should be taken from,.i$nem, and the public inM -aW Maddition be the:;&apos; sufferers, because in many cafes the users ofthe above articles would have^to travel many miles in order toobtain their eupply on acej^unt of their not   being any RegisteredChemists within reasonalue distance.    (Ampie proofs of this willbe given on freques t$&apos;r     Further, it would have the possible effect of causing&apos;&quot;householders to keep in stock a larger supplyof poison than usual in case of if r gent need.      For instance,   thehousewife finds that one or twcfe-articles have come.eut^of thewash ironmoulded, she obtains?&apos;&apos;locally a penny^trrt&apos;h of salts oflemon, properly labelled &quot;poisonous - not^lS be taken&quot;^ name anditmi $mm &apos;?-&apos;$address of seller - she finds after u^pFthat a little?&apos;is leftover, but not desiring t$;; keep anj^Jbison handy within reach ofthe children she promptly throws the remainder aw^ay, but if, as would be the case, the*saleiPas restricted to Registered Chemists,then she would probablywo!btain a large:.quantify and keep some in stock in case of emergency on account of the^ong distance she would have to travel.      The Board might find%t necessary tostate the percentage of a poison contained in various preparations
