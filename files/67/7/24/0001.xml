(T^S DCpIIMEayP IS THE PECEERTT OP HIS ERIIANICEC lifo3EST3?S (^^RTOiBlffi)c E C R E To COPY NO,     W ^PROPOSED MODIFICATION OP THE ATO-BAID WARNING- SYSTEM.Mejmcrandumjby^the Minister of Ham^Sedurl^Tolo   At the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 2nd July I said that I-was exaxrrining the possibility of modifying the air-raid warning system by introducing a new warning message which, without involving the sounding ofpublic air-raid warning signals, would have the effect of extinguishing theexempted external lighting allowed on railwayss docks and industrial establishments of national importance? which is at present extinguished onlyon receipt of the public warning (WoMo(40) 191st Conclusions, Minute 6(iii))oI now submits for consideration by the War Cabinet, the following proposals for a modification of the air-raid warning system designed tofacilitate a reduction in-the number of public warnings while at the sametime providing for the extinction of permitted lighting, on the approach of- hostile aircraft, even though no public warning has been giveno2a   The present warning system makes use of four messages, distinguishedby different colours0     These are the Yellow Message (Preliminary Caution)$the Red Warning (Action Warning) 3 the Green Message (Raiders Passed), andthe White Message (Cancel Caution)o     Any change which may be made to.11 bemuch simplified if the number of messages is kept at fouro    Examinationshows that it would be practicable to serve the purposes of the Green and white Messages by one message only, thereby allowing of the introduction ofa new Purple Message, to be known a.s &quot;Lights Warning&quot;s withoLit increasingthe total numberoThis new warning would.be issued to districts in the track of the raiderswhich are not expected to be the subject of serious or sustained attack, but which might be bombed if exempted lighting was not exbinguishedo3o   On receipt of this message all exempted outside lighting which atpresent is required to be extinguished on the Action Warning would be putout, but no other action would be taken, and no public warning would be given,provided, of course, that if this message had not been preceded by the&quot;Yellow Message&quot;, all the action normally taken on that message, e.go the calling out of key personnel for civil defence services, the warning of keymen in industry, the taking of preliminary steps to slow down certaincontinuous processes, would be taken on the purple messageo4o   Under the proposed scheme the White Message would become the&quot;Raiders Passed&quot; signal, and would be used to cancel any or all of the previousmessages (either Yellow, Purple or Red) which had been issuedo     accordingly the effect of the White Message would be to restore any lights extinguishedon the Purple Message^It should be noted that, under this scheme, the White Message willsometimes be in cancellation of a Yellow or Purple Message and sometimes incancellation of a Red Messages.     Only when it cancels Red will it involve thesounding of the public sirens!   and it must be left to the person in chargeof the siren to sound the siren, on receipt of the White Message, only if hehas previously received a Red Message and sounded the public warningo     Itmust be accepted as probable that this will sometimes lead to the public&quot;All Clear&quot; being sounded in error when no public warning has previously beensoundedo
50   Certain undertakings, e.go railways, are anxious to have&quot;ctheirexempted lighting restored, after extinction on warning, at the earliestpossible time o     The new system has the advantage that it would bepossible to give a quicker release from the Lights Warning than can be given from the present Red Warning, since the Lights Warning will not affect the public at large0Effect of the New Warning on Lighting.60   As all external lighting at docks, railway stations and yards,factories etcwould be extinguished, subject to certain minor exceptions,the effect of the new Lights Warning would be to produce a black-out whiohwould-be--substantially as. complete as that at present produced on receiptof the Action Warnings     The exceptions are(a) in some districts it may not be possible to inolude allestablishments having exempted lighting on the new Warning List.   (Anumber of these establishments do not at present receive the ActionWarning over the telephone, but rely upon hearing the siren)o   The numberof these exceptions is likely to be few, and could be confined toestablishments with a small number of lights onlyo(b) vehi cle headlamps which are at present extinguished on thesiren would have to be dealt with under the new system by individualinstructions given by the policeo     The putting out of headlampswould therefore take time and it is unlikely that all the headlamps\ in a district would be extinguished before a raider was overheads   Thiswould apply also in the case of shop signs, lights inside publicservice vehicles, torches, and certain other light3*(c) in the case of the railways it is proposed, in order tointerfere as little as possible with the running of trains, that locomotivefire-boxes should not be completely hooded, that the reading lights in passenger trains should be left on, and that railway personnel should be permitted to use hand-lamps for shunting operations after the LightsWarning is given0Subject to the results of air observation, the Air Staff do not regard these exceptions as likely to interfere seriously with the effectiveness of the black-outeEf fect pn Productionela   The new Lights Warning would have no effect on work insidefactories or other buildings where the interior lighting is screenedso as not to be visible from outside, and such work would proceed without interruptiono     Outside work would, however, largely be broughtto a standstill, and this would affect shipyards, steel works $constructional work, surface working at collieries, and similar outsideactivities.     The work of loading and unloading ships at docks couldnot continue without lights, but work in dock sheds could go on*     It isunderstood, however, that at present the amount of night work being donein docks is not largeoThere would be considerable slowing up of transport by rails   Althoughtrains would continue to run at normal speed instead of reducing to15 miles an hour, work in marshalling yards would be seriously delayedoWork in goods sheds would also be affected, though not to the same extentsThe speed of road transport would be reduced by the absence of headlightsoAs against the interference with certain types of work, thereshould be a general indirect benefit to  -production owing to the factthat the interference with the sleep of day workers caused by thesounding of sirens would be very largely reducedV
Conclusion^8.   The conclusion to he drawn from the foregoing considerations isthat a special Lights Warning is practicaDJc9 that it would facilitatea reduction in the number of Bed Warnings^ that it would produce a reasonably complete black-out? and that as regards production0 it wouldnot disturb the night9 s rest of day workers^    It is true that it would bring outside work to a standstill, and would interfere to some extentwith the working of the railways, and would seriously affect road transport; but these results would he no more serious than thoseproduced by the sounding of public warnings^    X am satisfied that thebalance of advantage is clearly on the side of introducing the change proposed in this Memorandums
