d r      x     85DOCUMENT IS &quot;THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC LiAJESTY5 S GOVERNMENT.)SjLff. RET.,-.  .fGU4Q)  172 oapnJULY.  I940o COPY NO.- /IVAR OiBIHET,.EFFECT OP BOMBINGS AND AIR RAID WARNINGS on production.Memorandum? by the Minister without Portfolio^The following information is based on reports which have been received &quot;by the Ministry of aircraft production, the Ministry of Supply and the Admiraltyregarding the effect on production caused by stoppagesof work, on receipt of the &quot;red&quot; warning.Factoriesr2.      The time spent in air raid shelters on several nightshas &quot;been three or four hours and in some cases five hours,with a resultant direct loss of production.,    In one case it is stated that the nightshifts spent half of their timein the shelters and no bombs fell and no gun-fire was heard.3. If a system were introduced under which the workersdid not proceed to shelter until gun-fire or homhs wereheard, it was estimated by several firms that the entirestaff could be underground in from 2 to 2-g- minutes; andanother report says that experience usually shows that 2or 3 minutes elapse from the time planes are heard untilthe time they arrive over the target.3.      It is said that the men would soon he come accustomed to carrying on with their work provided they have the assurance that they will be given sufficient time to gounderground when enemy activities are actually directed to their particular areas      It is thought that they will welcome the opportunity of continuing work until the verylast moment.      It is reported that at one aircraft factoryon a recent occasion a large number of men, after spendingsome time in the shelters, voluntarily offered to go hackto work.5.       One firm states that it proposes to make arrangementsfor a &quot;Return to Work&quot; signal to be given by a loud speakerin each underground shelter and that this signal might be given before the official &quot;All Clear&quot; is given by the localauthoritieSo* Note.    On the 2nd July, 1940, when a decision wastaken regarding the limitation of the air raid(red) warning, the Minister without Portfoliomentioned to the War Cabinet that the present memorandum was in course of preparation(WoM.(40) 191st Conclusions, Minute 6).

Factories..:unaeriMinlstry:--of -Qupplyi60     No extensive damage to factories of major importance had been reported up to last week--endo    Therepetition of air raid warnings will, however, have an adverse effect on production not only by reason ofactual stoppage of work but also because of the timetakento settle down afterwards, and because workerslose sleep even when not on the night-shifto      This is reflected in a certain amount of late timekeeping andtiredness which may be due partly to the seven day we eke7c      There have been a number of stoppages on variousdates at a number of factories, varying from a few minutes up to o&quot;&apos;er 3 hourso      In some cases estimates have been given of the consequent loss in terms ofactual products, e0go at Snfield,, 3 hours equals nearly20 Bren guns;    at BIrtley, S hours (the aggregate of3 separate stoppages) equals about 3000    cartridgecases;    at Nottingham, 5-g- hours (3 separate stoppages)equals two 5o7&quot; A&apos;oA* gunsc80       The morale of the workers is said to be high, andthey are determined to balance loss of working hours byharder &quot;work and loss of sleep by going to bed earlier^In the Royal Ordnance Factories loss of output has on thewhole been slight up to the presento    The greatest losses have been caused in the Filliiig^Faetories due to the stoppage of work on the &quot;yellow   warning, since workers engaged on certain delicate processes have to break offwork at this junctureo     At Woolwich arsenal, although no bombs were dropped in the vicinity, about eighteenhours were lost in June in the Filling Factories through&quot;yellow&quot; warningSo    This represents a loss of under 5% ofthe  outputs       It is estimated that the total losses in engineering and explosives factories generally have been considerably smalleroContractors v.r.\7orks *9.      There has been loss of production in the north-east,east and south-east area so     Where firms have endeavoured to estimate the loss of production, the figure has inmost cases been put at between 5% and lO^o10*      Loss of production from actual damage has been slight.Damage to the ammonia,, ammonium nitrate and nitric acidfactory at Billingham^ however; occasioned a reduction of4:0% in output in a week, although only slight damage toplant was causedo      (The result is less serious than itmight have been since stocks of ammonium nitrate are large,but the loss of nitric acid -production will have an adverse effect upon the output of T^NoTo     Full production at Billingham was restored on the 30th of June)o      Twoblast furnaces were also put out of action, at Scunthorpe.

11.      The effects up to date are stated to he practicallynegligible0     Absenteeism is to all intents and purposes the same whether there has been an actual raid or not, butit is thought that absenteeism will tend to increase ifthere is loss of sleep over a prolonged period     On week days the number of men failing to report for work first thingon the following morning after an air raid warning is about :% or 5%o     After the dinner hour about half the absenteesgenerally arrives12o      The case of Messrso Cammell Laird&apos;s of Birkenhead isspecially mentionedo     On the morning of the 23th of Junebombs were dropped in the river just off the works.    Therewas no air raid warning before the bombs were dropped, butthe &quot;yellow&quot; signal was received shortly afterwards -andthe &apos;red&quot; signal was not given at allo     Most of the menwho were working on the night-shift left their work and took shelter and they were rather upset at not    getting thewarningo      Cammell Laird* s, being a shipyard, ?/ork withexposed lights, and the arrangement is that the lights are put out within three minutes of  getting the &quot;red! signal.In view of the incident quoted? the management decided to discontinue the night-shift and to work in two shifts of nine hours eacho(lnt!d)    A, Go3RD JULY.  1940.
