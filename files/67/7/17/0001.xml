jffiatS DCCUiSOT JSJ32L HICEERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOTERNMSF^fJitt &apos;.....COPY NO.&amp;WAR   CABINET&apos; &quot; I ^iJJ&apos;!RS OF PARLIAIvlIDM1 STARVING- IN THE ARMY.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for War.-   1. King&apos;s Regulations forbid officers and soldiers to take any active part in politics, but it has been recognised that Members of Parliament whoare serving in the Array are in a special position.     Instructions were issued last Autumn to all Commands concerned that such Members must begranted leave in order to fulfil their Parliamentary duties.     This followsan answer to a question in the House of Commons by Mr. Hore-Belisha on.26th September, 1939, in which he said&quot;The right of a Member of Parliament to attend upon the House cannot beimpugned;     but, if such right were unreasonably or inappropriatelyinvoked, it might become impossible for the military authorities to allow the Member in question to continue to serve with his unit.     Normallythese matters can readily be arranged between the serving Member and hisCommanding Officer.     Members can bo trusted to judge rightly in thedischarge of their obligations, and their services in the armed forcesin time of war&apos; have always been highly valued, by this House from theearliest days of Parliament&quot;;.2, Further instructions were issued in April, 1940, that Members ofParliament might address public meetings of their constituents whenmilitary exigencies permit, wearing uniform or plain clothes at their discretion, and might also send messages and letters for publication in thelocal press in their constituencies.     Commanding Officers were alsoauthorised to allow bona fide prospective candidates to address meetings in their constituencies in plain clothes.     It was added that all concerned would be expected, in availing themselves of these facilities, to bear inmind, their obligations as members of the fighting forces and to exercise duediscretion in their utterances.3. There is no entitlement during the war voluntarily to resign acommission or to take discharge, but the Army Council can temporarily releasean officer or man frara military service or terminate his services if thecircumstances call for such a course.     Pour cases have arisen since theoutbreak of war in which Members of Parliament have applied to be released from service, in one case altogether and in the other three from service overseas(a) Major R.R, Stokes, Regular Army Reserve of Officers, age A3,applied for release from Army Service as an officer in the RegularArmy Reserve of Officers early in the war.     He was at first refused,but later, on representations from the Admiralty and Ministry ofSu]?ply that he was needed for war work as chairman of a munitionsfirm, release was approved.(b) capt-, L.H. Gluckstein, Territorial Army, age A3, when employed asa Legal Staff Officer at home, received orders to proceed overseasfor service with the British Expeditionary Force.     He protested on theground that while ho was ablo to carry out his Parliamentary dutieswhen serving at home he would not be able to do so if sent overseas.His case was carefully considered and eventually Captain Glucksteinagree3. to serve with the British Expeditionary Force.
(c) Major D0 McCallum, M.C., ago 51, employed as General Staff Officer2nd grade, II. q. Middle East,     Following his election to Parliament,ho wrote on 30th April, 1940j, while on leave, that he would have toror.ia.in within roach of Westminster in order to fulfil his parliamentary duties and would, therefore:, ho unable to return to duty at Cairo on completion of his two months: leave,.     His case is still under&quot;consideration,,(d) Major E.G,R. Lloyd, D.S.0,, Territorial Amy Reserve of Officers,ago       vr.s serving with the .12th Overseas Defence Battalion, The RoyalYfrrvic^shire Regirvrult, British E:qpeditioiiary Force,     lie returnedto the United Kingdom on &apos;,1 :.u&apos;70. and was elected to Parliament.     lie thenashed permission not to return to the British Expeditionary Force, butrequested that some military appointment should be found for him athome suitable to his talent for propaganda.     Alternatively he askedto be permitted to relinquish his military duties.     His case is still under consideration.4. In present circumstances, it is clear that difficulties might wellarise in tlie United Kingdom if leave were sought while operations were inprogress or threatened, especially in anti-aircraft units.5. The question has been carefully considered by the Army Council,and I recommend the adoption of the following rules :-(a) Leave to attend Parliament should continue to be granted as freelyas the exigencies of the Service permit.(b) whore a Member of Parliament is unwilling to continue serving onthe ur.d -rstanding at (a), he shall bo allowed to transfer to the Reserve,or oth orwiae bo temporarily released until further notice.A.e.The War Officev29th June, 1940,
