SECRET.W.P.(G)(40) 177.8TH JULY, 1 9kOoWAR CABINET.PREPARATION AGAINST INVASION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.At their 16hth Meeting held on the 13th June, 19h0,the War Cabinet approved the issue of a leaflet entitled&quot;If the Invader Comes&quot;.      At Appendix A rules 6 and 7are reproduced from this leaflet.This leaflet has now been issued and as it gives general rules only, various branches in the War Office are beinginundated with enquiries from all over the country asking for a lead as to hew these rules should be carried out.It is essential that the public should have fullinstructions at once.      Such instructions cannot be issueduntil the policy is decided as to whether defence arrangements are to include active resistance by the civil population orwhether the plans made are to rely solely on the use of themilitary and Local Defence Volunteers.It is the view of the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces,with which I am in agreement, that actual fighting should be restricted to the military and Local Defence Volunteers,and that no civilian who is not a member of these forces shouldbe authorised to use lethal weapons.      Only if this principle is accepted would it be possible to ensure control of militar&quot;activities by the military authorities.I therefore ask the War Cabinet to decide that activdefence plans are to be based solely on tho military andLocal Defence Volunteers;    that no civilian who is not amember of these forces should be authorised to use lethalweapons;    and that the organization of the defence of factories, etc., described in rule 6 should he carried out bythe enrolment of personnel concerned in the Local DefenaeVolunteers.(Intd. )      A.  E.The War Office,July, 19h00

APPENDIX   A .EXTRACT PROM PAMPHLET &quot;IF THE INVADER COMES&quot;.36       36       3C       X       36       36VI.If you are in charge of a factory, store or other works, organise its defence at once.      If you are a worker,make sure that you understand the system of defence thathas been organised and know what part you have to play init.      Remember always that parachutists and fifth columnmen are powerless against any organised resistance.They can only succeed if they can create disorganisation.Make certain that no suspicious strangers enter yourpremises.You must know in advance who is to take command,who is to be second in command, and how orders are to be transmitted.      This chain of command must be built up and you will probably find that ex-officers or N. COs. , whohave been in emergencies before, are the best people toundertake such command.      The sixth rule is therefore asfollows:-(6)  IN FACTORIES AND SHOPS,  ALL MANAGERS and workmen SHOULD ORGANISE SOME SYSTEM NOWBY WHICH A SUDDEN ATTACK CAN BE RESISTED.     ,VII.The six rules which you have now read give you ageneral idea of what to do in the event of invasion.More detailed instructions may,, when the time comes, begiven you by the Military and Police Authorities and bythe Local Defence Volunteers;    they will NOT be givenover the wireless as that might convey information to theenemy.      These instructions must be obeyed at once.Remember always that the best defence of GreatBritain is the courage of her men and women.      Here isyour seventh rule:-(7) THINK BEFORE YOU ACT.      BUT THINK ALWAYSOF YOUR COUNTRY BEFORE YOU THINK OFYOURSELF.
