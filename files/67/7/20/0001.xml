(tt^TS,DOOPMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.W.P,(G)(hO)  170 COPY NO.      /52ND JULY,  19u1.WAR CABINET.INTERNEES AND PRISONERS OF WAR,Memorandum by the Lord President ojT the Council.1. On 11th June I informed the Cabinet(W.M,(hO) l6lst Conclusions, Minute 6) that Canada had undertaken to receive k,000 internees and 3,000 prisonersof war,      I intimated that the If.,000 internees would absorb the most dangerous characters among the Germans and Italians,2. Since then, every effort has been made, on thedirection of the Prime Minister, to arrange for as manyinternees as possible to be sent overseas.3. I desire now to inform my colleagues of thepresent position and to bring to their notice certain difficulties which must be faced if we are to continue -as I think we should continue - the policy of sendinginternees out of the country.it-. The total number of male Germans and Austriansexcluding prisoners of war in this country at the beginningof this year was 29,000, classified as followsCategory A     (dangerous ^ 0 6 O      0 C O      9 0 0        2jCategory B    (subject to restrictions)..    ...      5,500Category C    (not subject to restrictions)  ..    21,000Practically all Category A and B have been interned.Category C is in process of internment.The total number of Italian males was approximately10,000, of whom h,000 (including 73k reputed Facists) havebeen interned,      6,000, who have been in this country for more than 20 years, or are outside the age limits of 16 to70 are still at liberty,5. Canada has agreed to accept internees and prisoners of war to a total of 7,000;    Newfoundland has agreed to accept 1,000 internees;    and Australia and NewZealand,  although the arrangements with these Dominions arenot yet complete, are expected to take 6,000 and h.,000respectively, .  -

6; On 21st June, the &quot;Duchess of York&quot; sailed for canada carrying 2,100 A Class Germans and 500 german prisoners of war0On 30th June the &quot;Arandora Star&quot; sailed for canada carrying 73k Italian Pacists and 2+79 A Class Germans.News has been received to-day that the &quot;Arandora Star&quot; was torpedoed early this morning.The &quot;Ettrick&quot; is due to sail for Canada on 3rd July carrying 858 b Class Germans, 1,32+8 German prisonersof war, and 2+05 young single Italians.The &quot;Sohieski&quot; is due to sail for Newfoundland and canada on 7th July carrying 2+50 German prisoners of war and1,000 single Germans between the ages of 16 and 2+0.     Theseare mainly Class B? but may include some C class.Accordingly arrangements have been made underwhich, by the end of the week, the total number of internees-who will have sailed for Canada or Newfoundland is:-2,298 German prisoners of warktk&apos;37 other Germans1^139 Italiansa grandtotal of -        7j37j+7. A vessel capable of carrying approximately 3,000internees could leave for Australia on 7th July, and two further vessels capable of carrying approximately 6,500,could sail for Australia and/or New Zealand about 15th July.If either, or both, of these vessels is not required forinternees, it would be used for children,,8. It will thus be seen that altogether arrangements have been made, or are in train, for shipping approximately17,500 prisoners of war and internees to Canada, Australiaand New Zealand.9. Por reasons with which I need not trouble mycolleagues, it has been decided that it would he impracticahleto send internees to Jamaica or any of the colonies.10. Arrangements are now- under discussion for thereturn to Italy of Italian internees in exchange for Britishcitizens. It is not therefore proposed to send any moreItalians to the Dominions in addition to the 73U Pacists and2+05 young single men who are included in the numbers already sent, or about to he sent to Canada. Apart from these, all future shipments to the Dominions will accordingly hecomposed of Germans or Austrians of Category B or C.11. The Home Secretary is of opinion that care shouldhe taken to select suitable internees for shipment.     he thinks that no internee should he sent overseas who belongsto any one of the following classes:-(a)     Men required for war productionh)      Men interned in errorc)     -Married men with wives and children in thiscountry, upon whom special hardship wouldhe imposed by separation.

He is also of opinion that special care should he taken not to mix Jews with Nazis or Pacists in the contingentssent overseasc12. The vetting of internees selected for shipmentin order to avoid inclusion of men in these classes, will necessarily take some time, and if the timetable already arranged, under which two further vessels are to leave for canada and Newfoundland and one vessel for Australia beforethe end of this week, is to be adhered to, it will be quite impossible to carry out the process of selection.      Moreover,it is possible that we should be unable to fill the accommodation available in these vessels if all internees inthe categories suggested by the Home Secretary were excluded.I desire, therefore, to make clear to my colleagues that ifwe adhere to the arrangements made for the shipment ofinternees to Canada, Newfoundland and Australia this week,it is possible that we shall include, in the numbers sent,internees in the categories the Home Secretary desires to exclude.13. This point is of special relevance in view of thefears expressed by the American Government and by the AmericaEmbassy in Rome, in the two notes of which I attach copies.It is, of course, possible that if we adhere to the policyof sendihg internees overseas. British prisoners of war and civilians in the hands of the Germans and Italians will be subjected to reprisals,,Ih. Despite these risks,  I am of opinion that weshould adhere to the arrangements made for the shipment ofinternees to Canada and Newfoundland this week.      Ifthought desirable, the departure of the ship for Australiacould be delayed for a few days in order to enable the internees who are to sail in her to be more carefully selected.15. As regards the vessels leaving for Australiaand New Zealand in the middle of the month, which, as stated above, would be capable of carrying 6,500 internees, therewill be sufficient time for the Home Office, in co-operationwith the War Office, to select the internees to be sent.If it is found that it is impossible to select the full6,500 without including internees In the categories whichthe Home Secretary desires to exclude, consideration couldbe given to releasing the shipping accommodation for childrei16. As soon as we have full information about theresults of the torpedoing of the &quot;Arandora Star&quot; and the lossof life entailed,  it will be necessary to consider:-(a) whether we should inform the German andItalian Governments of the event;(b) whether a public announcement should bemade in this country.Decisions on these matters might, I suggest, be left to the foreign Secretary in consultation with the Minister ofInformation and the Admiralty^(Intialled)   N.C.2nd July, 19h0.

 BI-260.The American Ambassador presents his complimentsto His Majesty&apos;s principal secretary of state for ForeignAffairs and has the honor, under instructions from hisGovernment, to put before Lord Halifax certainconsiderations with respect to the proposal to transfer to Canada certain German civilian internees and combatantprisoners of war now in the united Kingdom.The Department of state recalls that Lord Halifax&apos;note of 10th May, 1940 (no0 K.Wo9/3), mentioned the.&quot;great surprise with which the British Government learnedof the intention of the German Government to send from denmark to Germany for internment British subjects ofmilitary age who were in Denmark at the time of the german invasion&quot;. &apos;  in the same note it was stated that theBritish Government could not but feel that the german authorities were thus proposing to act with a harshnesstoward British subjects in Denmark whioh was totally outof keeping with the consideration which it was statedthat the British Government had shown   to German civilians in their hands.   The note in question was duly communicatedto the German GovernmentoThe Department of State suggests the possibility that execution of the proposal to trnasfer German civilian internees and combatant prisoners of war may lead theGerman Government to retaliate and perhaps even resort to reprisals against British nationals in Germany whichmight have far-reaching and distressing consequences formany British nationals and might well prejudice the unitedStates Government&apos;s ability to protect the Britishinterests entrusted to its careo   The Department of statehopes that serious thought will be given to the foregoingconsiderations.LONDON,28TH JUNE,  1940.

RBI-261oThe American Ambassador presents his complimentsto His Majesty&apos; s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign.Affairs and, with reference to Mr,   Kennedy&apos;s note No. RBT-260 of 28th June, 1940 concerning the proposal to transfer to Canada German civilian internees and combatant prisonersof war now in the United Kingdom... has the honor totranscribe below the text of a tolegrarn received from theAmerican Embassy at Rome under date of 27th June, 1940,through the Department of State:-&quot;Italian Government has been informed by the brazilian Government that the British Foreign Office statedto the Brazilian Embassy in London that 1,500 Italiansinterned in England are to be transferred to Canada inorder to be treated as prisoners in accordance with&quot;International Convention of 1929&apos;.      If this project iscarried out it is absolutely certain that the ItalianGovernment will retaliate in some manner against more than,000 British subjects believed remaining in Italy.Consequently I should appreciate it if Department couldverify British intentions in this regard and obtain full details and explanations for communication to ItalianGovernment.      This Embassy is already greatly handicappedin its efforts to protect British subjects because of reports reaching the Italian Government of mistreatmentof Italian subjects in England&quot;.LONDON.28th June;   19400
