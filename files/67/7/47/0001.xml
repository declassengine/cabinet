STAY PUT.Issued by the Ministry of information in co-operation with the Yfar Office and the Ministry of Home Security.If this island is invaded by sea or air everyone -who is not under orders must stay where&apos;he or she is.     This is not simply advice;   it isan order from the Government, and you must obey it just as soldiers obeytheir orders.     Your order is &quot;Stay Put&quot;, but remember that this doesnot apply until invasion comes.?/HY MUST I STAY PUT?Because in France, Holland and Belgium, the Germans were helped bythe people who took flight before them.     Great crowds of refugeesblocked all roads,     The soldiers who could have defended them could not get at the enemy.     The enemy used the refugees as a human shield.These refugees were got out on to the roads by rumour and false orders.Do not be caught out in this way.     Do not take any notice of any storytelling what the enemy has done or where he is.     Do not take ordersexcept from the Military, the Police, the Home Guard (L. D.V. ) and theA.R.P. authorities or wardens.WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I DON1 T STAY PUT?You will stand a very good chance of being killed.     The enemymay machine-gun you from the air in order to increase panic, or you mayrun into enemy forces which have landed behind you.     An official Germanmessage was intercepted in Belgium which ran:&quot;Watch for civilian refugees on the roads.     Harass them as muchas possible&quot;.Our soldiers will be hurrying to drive back the invader and willnot be able to stop and help you.     On the contrary, they will have to turn you off the roads so that they can get at the enemy.     You will nothave reached safety and you will have done just what the enemy wantedyou to do.HOW SHALL I PREPARE TO STAY PUT?Make ready your air-raid shelter;   if you have no shelter prepareone.     Advice can be obtained from your local Air Raid Warden or in &quot;YourHome as an Air-raid Shelter&quot;, the Government booklet which tells you how to prepare a shelter in your house strong enough to protect you againststray shots and falling metal.     If you can have a trench ready in yourgarden or field, so much the better, especially if you live where thereis likely to be danger from shell-fire.HOW CAN I HELP?Civilians who try to join in the fight will only get in the way.To beat off an enemy attack is the job of the military forces, which include the Home Guard.     If you have no other wartime task join theHome Guard at once.     For those who cannot join there are many ways inwhich the Military and Homo Guard may need your help in their preparatl-r&quot;Find out what you can do to help in any local defence work that is going on,  and be ready to turn your hand to anything if&apos; asked by the military or Home Guard to do so.If you are responsible for the safety of a. factory or some other important building,; get in toUch with the nearest military authority!&apos;&apos;You will then be told- how your defence should fit in with the military organisation and plans.
WHAT SHALL I DO IF THE INVADER COMES MY WAY?If fighting by organised forces is going on in your district and you have no special duties elsewhere, go to your shelter said staythere till the battle is past.     Do not attempt to join in. the fight.Behave as if an air-raid were going on.     The enemy will seldom turnaside to attack separate houses.But if small parties are going about threatening persons and property in an area not under enemy control and come your way, you have the right   of every man and woman to do what you can to protectyourself, your family and your home.STAY. PUT.It&apos;s easy to say. When the time comes it may be hard to do.But you have got to do it;, and in doing it you will be fighting .Britain&apos;s battle as bravely as a soldier.
