(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)i nS E C RET. COPY NO.      &apos; JW.P.(G) (40)171.   &apos;    .3rd July, 1940.-  - - &apos; WAR, CABINET.COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA- Memorandum by the Home Secretary.v.- 1.     A recent leaflet issued by the Communist Tarty and widely distributed raises the question whether steps ought now to be taken to cLecivCommunist propaganda and in particular to suppress the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;.2. -   The recent leaflet, which is entitled &quot;The People Must Act&quot;,says:    &quot;The appalling catastrophe that has befallen the French people isa final warning to us................   The same kind of leaders who broughtFrance to defeat are in high places in Britain. . They have the same record,policy, and aims as those who are responsible for Hitler&apos;s victory overFranoe.........   A new government must come to power now, a government. really representative of the working- people, a government in which thereshall- be no representative of Imperialism or friend of Fascism...........Let the British workers take the destiny of their class and of Britaininto their own strong hands......,.   We of the Communist Party who have consistently fought for the real defence and interests of the people putforward now the most urgent measures which need to&apos; be immediately carried through as the only way of salvation.   Clear out all supporters of Fascism,the men -.of Munich, and all responsible for the present situation...conscript wealth..;secure the election of workers -control committees inthe factories.arm the workers in the factories...withdraw all regulationsthat take away the right of free speech...end the partition of Ireland...build up a unity and close fraternal relations with the socialist soviet union and.with the working people of all countries for freedom and peace......    Such a government alone can secure for the people the unity and unbreakable will:to. victory that can guarantee the defeat both of the nazi menace and of the danger which also threatens from the british representatives of Fascism.....   Such a government can immediately bringabout close fraternal relations with the Soviet Union, and secure thesupport of the people of Germany and France and help forward theirstruggles against their class enemies for the victory of peace andsocialism&quot;.3.     Strong representations have been made, to me that the distributionof this leaflet ought not to be tolerated in the present situation.   Apartfrom any effect it may have on the minds of those who feel any sympathy forits doctrines, the thrusting of such a leaflet upon the attention of thepublic causes natural resentment and a widespread feeling that acquiescence in attempts to disrupt the national unity on the war policy is notconsistent with a spirit of resolute leadership in the present criticaltimes.4.     The leaflet, however, only sets out in a condensed form propagandathat has been systematically appearing in the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; for some time.After the making of the Defence Regulation relating to the&quot;systematic publication of matter which is calculated to foment oppositionto the prosecution of the war to a successful issue&quot;, there was for a time a substantial change in the tone of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;.   Those who were responsible for its publication were evidently anxious to avoid bringing the paper within the ambit of that Regulation.    On the 1st June the paper
announced that, an Editorial Board had been formed, of whichProfessor J.B.S. Haldane was Chairman, and since that date the paper has been careful to avoid propaganda directly anti-war in character.Indirectly, however,  it has carried on anti-war propaganda, which has-become gradually bolder.     The policy of the paper is to representthat all difficulties are due to the existing form of Government,that the coalition Government is merely an attempt by the &quot;big businessrulers&quot; of the Empire&quot; to use the Working classes for their own ends,that all the new regulations for the control of industry are intendedto make the position of the workers worse while maintaining the privileges of the employers, and that salvation is only to be foundif the workers of all Countries join hands with the Soviet Uriion.5.     While the paper Carefully refrains from opposing directly the continuation of the War effort, it never says a,word to encourageanyone to take a share in that effort, and persistently represents all those who are responsible for the Government of the country as incompetentand as concerned with the interests of a class rather than the interestsof the. nation...6,     Under Defence Regulation 2D the Secretary of State has power,if satisfied &quot;that there is in any newspaper a systematic publicationof matter which is in his opinion calculated to foment opposition tothe prosecution to a successful issue of any war in which His majesty is engaged&quot;, to make an order prohibiting the printing, publicationor distribution of such a newspaper.If such an order were made against the &quot;Daily W0rker&quot;, itwould then be possible to take appropriate action against leafletssuch as the one referred to at. the. beginning of this memorandum.   Unless,however, action is taken against the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, there is littlethat can be done with regard to the distribution of such leaflets.The most that can be done is for the police to prosecute the distributorsof leaflets for conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace, but theauthorities are of course open to a charge of inconsistency if actionof this kind is taken against subordinate members of the CommunistParty .and nothing is done to check the publication of the &quot;Daily W0rker&quot;by the responsible leaders of the Party.J.A.HOME OFFICE.3rd July, 1940.
