Previous Reference: W.P. (G) (40) 176 andW.M. (40)201st conclusions Minute 1.Memorandum by the Secretary of State forIndia.I submit for consideration a revised draft of the proposed declaration to accompany the Viceroy&apos;s invitation to Indianleading men to join in the enlarged Executive Council and war advisory Committee.      The main change, following the suggestion of the Lord President of the Council,  has been to transpose the sequence of the paragraphs in order to put in the forefront the responsibilities and obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand to make it clear that any constitutional scheme devisedby Indians must be subject to the fulfilment of these obligationsI have also omitted the sentence committing His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the acceptance of any constitutional scheme thatmay emerge from an Indian Conference.     The wording now suggested would leave them free to object to features in the newconstitution that were patently absurd or unjust.I would,  however, still earnestly commend to the WarCabinet the desirability of such a declaration which, whileit can add nothing to what is already the declared object ofour policy, does meet the criticism that we refuse to give any indication as to the method by which we intend to see Indianself-government brought about or as to the date at which, sofar as we are concerned,  we mean to initiate it.     The rightto frame their own Constitution is one which Indians naturallyregard as a logical corollary of Dominion status,  and,  subjectto the fulfilment of our special responsibilities, I do not see how we can,  in the light of our past pledges, refuse it.      the safeguarding of our responsibilities in the form of an agreementwritten into the Constitution is,  again, a concession to theprinciple of equality underlying Dominion status which does not affect the substance of the control retained, but does mean agreat deal to Indian sentiment.The whole constitutional,issue in India to-day is,  indeed,largely a matter of sentiment and desire for a recognition of racial equality.      Not even Congress members really suppose that india could exist as an independent country tomorrow or could do,for many years, without the support of British troops, not to speak of that of the Navy.      What I contend is that,  if we make concessions to that sentiment which do not affect the essentialsof our obligations, Indians on their side will be more ready torecognise the fact of those obligations and the realities ofIndia&apos;s position in the world.It is not suggested that the proposed declaration will be acceptable to Congress, or that the Congress Working Committeewill/SECRET Copy Ho. ^W.P.

will sanction its leaders taking part in the enlarged ExecutiveCouncil.     But I have no doubt that it will be warmly welcomed by the great body of Indian opinion outside Congress?  as wellas by many of the supporters of that body, and that it will do much to disarm Congress opposition.      If, contrary to expectation?Congress should decide on extreme courses, we shall have a muchgreater backing of opinion, both in India and outside?  intaking a strong line against it.At the same time what I am concerned with is not so much the fear of trouble in the immediate future, as a progressivedeterioration of the whole Indian situation to a point fromwhich recovery may become impossible.      The purpose of theproposals put forward by the Viceroy is to prevent thatdeterioration and to make use.of what,  in his opinion, is theright moment in the state of Indian public opinion to create anew spirit of practical co-operation which may lead to progressiveimprovement in the Indian outlook in future and, meanwhile? secure a wholehearted measure of support for India&apos;s war effort.L.3.A.India Office?13th July?   1940.

REVISED DRAFT STATEMENT.1*     At this moment in the world struggle against aggression and tyranny His Majesty&apos;s Government feel assured that It is the earnest wish of the people of India to throwthemselves wholeheartedly and unitedly into the defence oftheir country and of the common cause.      They believe thatthis unity of national purpose will be helped, and some ofthe misunderstandings which have arisen in recent monthsremoved, by a clear statement of their attitude to the stepsto be taken towards the declared goal of British policy inIndia.2.      It is the firm intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that India should attain, at the earliest practicable moment after the war, to her natural and rightfulposition as an equal partner-member In the BritishCommonwealth of Nations, free to control her own affairs and shape her own destiny.3.     The long connection of Great Britain with India has,however,  imposed on His Majesty&apos;s Government responsibilities and obligations for which they are bound to make provision andhas created an intimate co-operation in regard to defence and foreign policy the necessity for which will subsistuntil India is able to meet unaided her needs in this field.The principal obligations here referred to, besides those relating to defence, concern the fulfilment of obligations to the Indian States to the extent that they do not join in and become part of the future scheme of Indian self-government, and the securing of the reasonable rights of theexisting members of the Public Services.4.      Subject therefore to suitable provision being madefor meeting these needs and responsibilities, His majesty&apos;s government are willing that the permanent structure of future Indian self-government should be determined by indians for themselves, and they intend that immediately onthe conclusion of hostilities the whole position should be examined anew in all its aspects, central and provincial,by whatever constitutional convention may meantime beagreed upon for this purpose by representatives of theprincipal elements in Indians national life.5.     If the permanent structure of the Constitution isto be devised by Indians for themselves itis essential that there should be agreement both as regardsthe composition of the constitutional convention, the methodof selecting its members and the machinery by which it willarrive at its conclusions, and as regards theconstitutional scheme which is to result from its labours.His Majesty&apos;s Government could not contemplate the transferof their present responsibility for the peace and welfare ofIndia to any system of government whose authority is directly denied by large and powerful elements in India&apos;national life nor could they be parties to the coercion ofsuch elements into submission to such a Government.    ^Theyare convinced that agreement is possible and that it is desired by the vast majority of the people of India.      Fortheir part they would be most willing, as they have alwaysbeen,  to lend any assistance in their power to bring thevarious parties together and to help to find a solution-of the difficulties which have stood in the way of progressin the past.     Nothing would give greater satisfaction toHis/

2.His Majestyfs Government than that agreement should bereached and the work involved completed in time to enableIndiafs new self-devised self-governing Constitutionentering into force within a year of the conclusion of thewar.6.      It is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government thatthe needs and obligations referred to above can most appropriately be met through the provisions of an instrument of Agreement as between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the proposed convention acting on behalf of the new government of India.     The Agreement in question would befor a stated period of years.      It would be renewable by negotiation in so far as oircumstances might require, andit would for its duration be embodied in the indian constitution as an integral part of that Constitution andwould enter into force concurrently with it.7.     It is obvious that no such fundamentalreconsideration of the existing Indian Constitution can takeplace in the midst of a great war.     But within the framework of that Constitution His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare anxious to enlist to the full the active cooperationof all parties and elements in the political life of India.In pursuance of that object His Excellency the Governor-General has been authorised to invite representative indians to join his Executive Council as well as to associate withthem in a wider War Council (which would meet at regular intervals) representatives of the Indian States and ofother interests in the national life of India as a whole.His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that in the gravecircumstances of to-day the general will of all parties to cooperate for the war effort may also lead to such ameasure of common agreement in the provinces as may make possible at an early date the resumption with general assent of Parliamentary government in those provinces whichare now being administered under the emergency provisions ofthe Government of India Act.8.     His Majesty1s Government hope and believe that inthis way India will be able even within the limits of thepresent Constitution to play her appropriate part in theconduct of the war and to prepare herself for the tasks ofa full and free national life which lie before her.
