THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. COPT NO.     ^W.P.(G)  (40) 192.WAR   CABINET.20th July, 1940. --UTILISATION   OF   ALIEN   MAN-POWER.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1.     The YiTar Cabinet   at its meeting on 17th July, 1940 (Minute 1 of the206th Conclusions) asked me to prepare and submit a scheme for finding workfor non-enemy aliens who had recently come to this country.     There are inthis country at the present time large numbers of friendly aliens from countries who are or have been allied to us, but I have no reliable information as to the precise numbers.    They include Belgians,   Czechs,Poles and some French, Dutch and Norwegians.   They should provide aconsiderable field of labour supply which should be organised to assist thewar effort of this country rather than be&apos; left to live in idleness on charity.2. &apos;   So far as Germans and Austrians are not interned I should propose,unless the War Cabinet see objection, to deal with these in the same way aswith aliens from countries which have been in alliance with us.3.     To organise this supply of alien man-power, I propose to set up anInternational Labour Branch as.part of the Employment Department of theMinistry of Labour and National Service.    This Branch should have its headquarters at a separate office in London.     As head of the Branch I would propose to appoint an officer (Mr. T. T. Scott) who has, had long experience with the International Labour Organisation at Geneva and vras previously inthe Indian Civil Service.    This officer should have on his staff persons whoare able to speak the languages of the different aliens concerned, and so    ,far as possible separate rooms should be allotted to each nationality.i4. I propose that the Branch should be assisted by an Advisory Committee \consisting of reliable representatives from the foreign countries associatedjwith the Trades Union Congress General Council. A Committee of this kind :would, I suggest, be of great assistance to the Aliens War Service Bepartmenin dealing with the question of security and in investigating the bona fidesof aliens.5.     I suggest that all uninterned male aliens within our military ages,i.e, between the ages of 20 and 41, should be required to enlist in a specialunit of the Army, subject to physical fitness and to certain reservations inrespect of skilled workers on the lines of the Schedule of Reserved OccupationsI appreciate that some foreign Governments are applying or proposing to applyconscription to men of military age in this country to compel them to jointheir own national forces,   I should not think it right.to interfere in anyway with this arrangement but, in so far as aliens are not conscripted by their-own national authorities, they should be conscripted subject tc the reserva-tions&quot;mentioned above into our own forces.    I understand that the Secretaryof State for War is taking steps to raise, a Pioneer Battalion from aliens andI should like to see.it recruited under compulsory powers.     Without such anarrangement, I feel it would be impossible to carry out the rest of my plan,namely to get the remaining aliens into employment in this country, as therewould be popular antagonism towards the /civil employment of aliens of military age and military fitness in jobs from which British nationals have beencompulsorily recruited into the forces.6.     With regard to aliens not recruited either into their ovm. national forces or into the British forces, I propose that they should in the first place berequired to register particulars of their industrial qualifications with thenew International Labour Branch of my Department I have suggested above.    Sofar as possible, I should avoid requiring them to register at the ordinaryLocal Offices of the Ministry, though tho services of the Local Offices would
be available for obtaining employment where required for such registeredaliens.    I would, however, suggest that it would be advisable as a rulenot to place them as individuals in employment in the ordinary workshopswith British workers, and I would urge that the Ministry of Supply should arrange for the provision of one factory or several factories in whichthe aliens could be employed in mass and in which whatever supervision isrequired could be given.     Any aliens who are placed in employment should,of course, receive the ordinary trade union rates for work they doo7.     The position of the foreign crews of ships formerly belonging to countries occupied by the Germans raises a number of difficult points which need consideration immediately.    I propose to take them up with theMinistry of Shipping.8.     With regard to professional workers of high qualifications, I should propose to transfer to the new International Labour Branch the existingCentral Aliens Register for professional workers, and I would require all workers with suitable qualifications to place their names on this Register.These workers should also so far as practicable be employed under special arrangements and should not be diffused more than is necessary over thecountry.9.     Social services in accordance with British standards should be providedfor    -aliens who have been placed in employment (including ships crews).    Thiswill involve in certain cases some form of Treasury grant to cover the perioduntil the aliens pay the qualifying contributions for normalbenefits.     Thedetails should be worked out, I suggest, by the Government -Departmentsconcerned.10.    Departmental discussions which have already taken place as to the civil employment of aliens have reached the stsge where the Foreign Office was about to approach foreign Governments or foreign National Committees with a view to.effecting compulsory registration of aliens at the Employment Exchanges,&quot;ubject to the modification that the registration should be effected underppcial arrangements by the new Branch of the Ministry, I agree that theBpdwill of the foreign Governments or National Committees should be secured;il their co-operation enlisted, but I do not think it desirable to allow thejJibcess to delay the steps which are obviously necessary as a preliminary toaaking use of the available, alien&apos; man-power.(Intd) E.B.20th July, 1940.    .H.Q.898-72.G.J.2.
