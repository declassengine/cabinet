SECRET . Copy NojWP (G)(40) 19420th July, 1940.WAR   cabinet ministerial BROADCASTSMemorandum by the Minister of information am very grateful to my colleagues for the assistance they havegiven me in the matter of broadcasting and I am very anxious that those ministers who have not already broadcast should do so at their ownconvenience when they have&quot; communications to make to the public.      It isthe easiest method of getting a message to a vast audience, as it is calculated that somewhere in the neighbourhood of 20 million people listen to the 6 o&apos;clock and 9 o&apos;clock News Bulle-fcins every day.If Ministers who are willing to broadcast will communicate withthe Ministry of Information, we shall always be glad to make the necessary arrangements.The B.B.C.  suggest that, if time is available, a short rehearsalcan be of great value.     I have told them, however, that such time is usually not available.     But they also suggest that if they could have thescript of any announcement a few hours before it is delivered they can oftenmake suggestions, owing to their intimate knowledge of the technique of broadcasting, which Ministers might find useful.     Personally I have found such suggestions very useful.     They know the language that is appropriate Ito broadcasting and detect the formal, departmental phrase which does not    1produce the right effect upon the public.     For instance, they would alwaysprefer the first person singular to the impersonal &quot;it is considered&quot;.These small points, which so easily escape attention, are of considerable importance, and only the expert staff at the B.B.C. are qualified toadvise on them.D. C.20th July, 1940.
