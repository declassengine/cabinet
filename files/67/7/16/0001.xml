( HIS DOCUMENT IS the property op hts britannic majesty&apos; s ggvernmeiit.)1 ^Copy No.    X secret.w.p. (g) (40) 166June 29th.war cabinet.calling up op men registered pormilitary service.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.The Cabinet on June 21st requested the Minister of information to take steps to explain to the public the undesirability of calling upmen faster than they could be absorbed by the Military organisation.I have consulted my advisers on the subject and find that thisis not an easy task to perform. All reports on home morale agree that thepublic is becoming increasingly disturbed at delay in embodying the fullman-power of the nation in the armed forcesj   and it is clearly necessaryto meet this criticism.   The argument that it is useless to train menuntil there is an adequate supply of equipment to am them is met with therejoinder that they can learn discipline, can be hardened and can beprepared for further training without actually being furnished with arms.To the argument that there is no accomodation for them comes the answer that they might be billetted as they were at the beginning of the last war, that there are thousands of unoccupied houses in all parts of theoountry and also that it should be possible to provide tents. When it is pointed out that there is an insufficient supply of Non-CoramissionedOfficers, the answer is that there are thousands of men between kO and 60who served in the last war who could very easily instruct troops inelementary training. It is urged that men who have served even a short period of training would be useful in time of emergency to take the placeof casualties. They could at least be armed with the new form of hand-grenade which is to be issued in the near future, and which it isunderstood can be manufactured in very large quantities with very little delay.But dissatisfaction is not confined to the question ofreoruiting for the armed forces. The purport of the Emergency Powers Acthas been explained and in spite of the great interference with privateliberty which it entails it was received with enthusiasm. Now publicopinion is restive because the powers then taken are not being invokedto fill the gaps which admittedly exist in the A.R.P, and Pire Servicesand for other purposes. There is also a strong and widespread feeling that man-power should be mobilised, campulsorily if neoessary, for defenceworks of all kinds and especially for agriculture where the shortage oflabour is notorious, a shortage likely to be increased if the annualimportation of agricultural labour from Ireland is to be res trio-ted,of the population are anxious to serve and make sacrifices. their desire at the present time is for definite orders and compulsory tasks.

Initialled D.C..29th June,1940.I would therefore suggest that a Committee should be set up on-which the Service Deparixaents and the Ministries of Home Security, Labourand Supply should be represented, vd.th the object&apos; of finding work ofnational importance for every able-bodied man and, so far as possible, everyable-bodied woman in the country, and with authority to take the necessary powers to corapel them to&apos; do it.   The result need not be any very revolutionarysudden or drastic change, because the majority of people are no doubt already &apos;engaged on such work, but it would convey the feeling to the people that theGovernment had the whole situation in hand, that full use was being made ofthe man-power of the country, that no time was being lost, that no effort wasbeing wasted and that the full energy of the whole community was beingharnessed to the task of winning the war.
