C0Fy N0.J ^WAR CASINST.ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO Ti:E2POLITICAL DEADLOCK IN INDIA.Memo ran dum by the Secretary of State for India.I wish to consult the War Cabinet as to the answer to be given to two questions on India which have to be answered in the House of Commons on 23rd May.     The questions and the proposed answer are given belowo(Intd,)     -L.S.A.India Office, S.W.1.MR.. BENN:      To ash the Secretary of State for India, whether he can indicate the attitude of His Majesty&apos;present Government towards the problems facingthem in India.    /Thursday, 23rd Mayy7.MR. HARVEY:    To ask the Secretary of state for India, whether,in view of the recent encouraging pronouncementsof Mr. Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, heis able to make any statement about thepolitical situation in India;    and whether any measures have yet been taken to promote a smallconference of representative Indian leaders ofall parties to agree upon the next steps towards a solution of the constitutional deadlock./Thursday, 23r-d May/7.s.   . Answer.I am glad to have this early opportunity of explaining,so far as I can within the limits of an answer to a question,the attitude of the Government to the present regrettablepolitical deadlock in India.      The attainment by India of fr/and equal partnership in the British Commonwealth is the go?of our policy as it was that of the late   Government,     we recognise, as my predecessor made clear in his speech of 18t\April, that it is for Indians themselves to play a vital partin devising the form of Constitution best adapted to India&apos;s

conditions and to India&apos;s outlook.      The promise already given that the present scheme of the Act of 1935 and thepolicy and plans on which it is based are to he open tore-examination at the end of the war necessarily impliesdiscussion and negotiation and not dictation.,     We have no desire to delay any of the steps that may pave the way towards an agreed settlement that will take account of the legitimate claims of all communities and interests.      Onthe contrary we have been and are  :;most aiixi ou? to make our contribution towards such a settlement,,      Thedifficulty at this moment lies not in His Majesty&apos;sGovernment but in the acute cleavage of opinion which has developed in India itself affecting issues fundamental tothe character of her future Constitution and even to the approach to the problerricI refuse to regard that cleavage as necessarilyuribri&amp;gable.      Even if no agreement on the major issue isimmediately in sight I cannot think that it is beyond theresources of Indian statemanship to find at any rate, such a provisional accommodation as would admit of the resumptionof office with general consent by Ministers in the   -Provinces and the appointment to the Governor-General&apos; executive Council of representative public men on thebasis already offeredc      I believe that such a solutionof the present deadlock, provisional no doubt, but stilleasing the way to eventual agreement, would be eagerlywelcomed by the overwhelming body of Indian public opinion.I am loath to believe that in the situation which faces thewhole civilised world today the readiness to make someapproach towards agreement will not be forthcoming on thepart of Indian statesmen.    India has from the outset mademanifest her sympathy and support for the Allied cause and her anxiety to lend to that cause all the aid in her power.That those who have been most concerned to stress India&apos;sdomestic claims should now, in the words reported as havingbeen used a day or two ago by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, settheir regard for India&apos;s honour even in front of thoseclaims is sincerely appreciated by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Viceroy, with the approval of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment has spared no effort to bring the parties together and to endeavour to find a basis for progress whichwould be generally acceptable,,     His own readiness to helpin any way he can remains unabatedo      It is the sincereand earnest hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that in thesecircumstances existing differences may be put aside andthat the leaders of the great political parties in Indiav/ill come together in agreement in support of the common cause.
