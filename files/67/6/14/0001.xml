Tj.ggjnpOUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.:     ;g-p-TG (40) 114. q--- nnPY nd.   Id; c?7t.b April, 1940.I-- W A R      CABINET,Reduction of Volume of British shipping in Mediterranean,,Note by Minister of Shipping,,1. On 18th April,  the Cabinet:.-&quot;Invited the Minister of Shipping to consider whether,and if so, what measures should be taken at once to.reduce the volume of British shipping passing throughthe Mediterranean,  and to report to the War Cabinet&quot;.2. The following action has actually been taken:-(1) Prom 19th April onwards, vessels sailing from australia or New Zealand to the United Kingdom via Suez have beenrouted via the Cape,  except the Mail service from australia, which will continue via Suez and carry any supplies for the Middle East Force,      It may benecessary to send other ships from Australia to egypt in order to carry the whole of these supplies.Government stores outwards for the Mediterranean arebeing concentrated in as few vessels as reasonablypossible, particularly in the cases of vessels bound for East of Suez.      Outward tramps in ballast from united Kingdom for Australia proceed via the Cape.(2) From the 27th April, under instructions received from theWar Cabinet,(a) Liners sailing outward to Australia and New Zealandvia Suez are being routed via Cape,  except mailsteamers,and(b) Liners,  tramps and tankers proceeding to and fromFar East,  India,  the Persian Gulf, and East Africaare being routed via Cape,.      The question is raised in 5(1) whether this should apply to mail steamersboth out and home.The loss of time on these voyages will he:At 12 knots    At 9 leiTo and from Far East t.              . 12 days 16 days&quot;    &quot;        &quot;    East side of India 14 days 18 days&quot;    &quot;        &quot;    West side of India 16 days 22 day?&quot;    &quot;        &quot;    Persian Gulf ..... 16 days 22 days&quot;    &quot;        &quot;    East Africa...... 9 days 12 daysDiversion of vessels loading on the West coast ofIndia or in the Persian Gulf lengthens the voyage by approximately 50$.The action applies to British vessels and so far aspracticable to neutral vessels chartered to us.

The decisions under (2) are being applied not only to ships which have not yet sailed but to all vessels en routewhich have not passed Gibraltar or Aden,3,     Gve-rseas Bunker     Depots, coal and oil affected by a diversion, are being stocked up,Z.;..     British ships and neutral vessels on charter to Ministryof Shipping are now being bunkered so that they can be diverted via Cape.      This action will shut out a substantial volume of cargo both outward and homewarde5.     The next steps which could be taken,  in order of priority,would be:-(i) To apply the foregoing decisions to mail steamersor alternatively to hold them at Gibraltar, port said or Aden.Mediterranean.(ii) Vessels bound for Mediterranean not to dischargeor load East of Tunis unless taking Governmentstores to Egypt, Palestine or Turkey.     This would cut out Italy, Malta, Danube and Egypt, but would&apos; allow loading of ore in North Africa.Tankers not to load at Constanza or Haifa exceptfor Egypt, or destinations East of Malta.(iii) British ships or neutrals chartered to us couldbe warned to avoid Italian ports on suitablepretexts.(iv) Obstacles could be put in the way of Italian shipsbound for Italy,(v) The final step would be to turn back westward all ships west of Tunis and to turn back eastward all ships east of Malta (subject to detailed Admiraltyinstructions) and to order all ships under british control to clear from Italian or Adriatic ports.6.     Any marked contraction in the volume of tonnage tradingto or in the Eastern Mediterranean would, of course, complicate the problem of supplying Malta, Palestine and Egypt and themovement of troops in that area.7.     Any large-scale diversion which is likely to last morethan a week or two will seriously impair the fulfilment ofour import programme and make it necessary to consider at anearly d.ate a greater concentration on the short North atlantic route and greater shipments of oil from the Gulf of Mexicoand the Dutch West Indies with consequently larger demands fordollar exchange.8,     We have been in touch with the French Mission here and theinformation so far is that the French have taken no action.R.S.H.Ministry of Shipping,27th April 19hO.
