WAR CABINETARMING OF THE POLICEMomoranduETby the. Home -Secretagy,1,     The police are a civilian force, normally unarmed, and only a minority of the members of the regular and auxiliary police forces are atpresent trained in the use of firearms,2.     Even in the existing situation the main body of the policemust remain available for the performance of normal police duties, for mostof which the carrying of arms is unnecessary and undesirable.   There is,however, a large number of men - approximately 10,000 full-time policemenand many thousands of part-time Special Constables - now employed inguarding vulnerable points against sabotage.3.      As regards the risk of enemy landings by parachute, thefunctions of the police should in the main be confined to -(a) observing, and reporting to the military authorities,the presence of parachutists; and(b) preventing attempts at sabotage or other acts of violence by isolated individuals and overpowering andarresting the individuals where possible.4.      There are accordingly, certain particular purposes for  which if would be proper and desirable to take steps immediately to arm the police,namely -(a) Guarding vulnerable points against sabotage, as far as this is undertaken by the police.(b) Protecting important police stations against attempts to seize them by enemy raiding parties, whether parachutistsor not.   For this purpose selected members of the staffs ofthe stations should be armed.(c) Armed motorised patrols employed in parties of from tsvG to four men, especially in rural districts and at the approaches to important towns.(d) Armed Police posts should be established, where men can be spared, at bridges or other key points with a view tocontrolling movements on the road, and holding upindividual parachutists attempting to reach their rallyingpoint or to approach particular objectives, e.g. for purpose,of sabotage.SSSE COPY NO.f.P. (gK40) 15423rd May. 1940.

5.     Beyond the functions referred to in the preceding paragraph,there remain certain tasks such as -(a) overpowering formed parties of parachutists.    This it issuggested is a matter for the military authorities orthe Local Defence Volunteer units,(b) Protecting points of importance other than police stationswhich might form primary objectives for parachute parties and are not now scheduled as vulnerable points for specificprotection e,g. railway stations, local telephone exchanges and many power stations.   This appears to be a task to beundertaken primarily by units of Local Defence Volunteersformed either from the general force or on the basis oflocal units from the staffs of the establishments concerned.It is submitted that both of these functions are outside theproper scope of the police,6,     The police are already in possession of a certain number ofarms, including (a) arms - mainly revolvers or automatics - held as partof normal police equipment for occasional use e.ga in arresting dangerouscriminals, and (b) a limited number of rifles and service revolvers lentby the War Office for use by the police employed at ports or in protectingcertain vulnerable points.7.     The numbers of arras now held by the police would fall far short of those required for the duties enumerated in paragraph 4, and it hasbeen provisionally estimated that for these purposes an additional 12,000rifles and 10,000 revolvers would be required.   Whether these numbers are needed will, however, depend to some extent on the development - of theLocal Defence Volunteer, corps;   if this corps is in a position at an earlydate to relieve the police of any considerable proportion of theirprotective duties, the numbers could be proportionately reduced.8, I should be glad if I might have the authority of the WarCabinet to issue instructions to the police to proceed on the lines indicated in this memorandum, so far as the arms available to them permit.J.A,Home Office.
