89- ^-ft-Qs--fa9^-356-Report to the Minister of Infonnation by theB.B.C. Security Measures Committee..     sc- Action - to, be - -taken by the Bo 3.C. in theevent ^f. Air Attack ,cn jthis Country&apos;;1.       The present instructions to the B,BSC0  are laid down on C.I.D.%       Paper ITo. 1584/3 dated August 4th, 1939 - see paragraphs 20 &amp; 21 of Document/      *G1 , issue 5, enclosed -with that paper., -a copy of -which is enclosed as appendix 1 to this Memorandum.,,     Briefly, the  arrangements provide:(a) i that on the instruction of Fighter Command Headquarters given direct to the BoBoCoj the B.B*Co may be required temporarily to close down all theexisting transmitters in this country with the exception pf those carrying the overseas Service on short wave-lengths;(b) that when&apos;all transmitters are thus closed d.own they may not be re-opened until Fighter Conajand Headquarters give permission direct to the B.B.C.,except on receipt of instructions on the direct line from the Central War Roomto the Bs.Bt.Ce    to re-open for short periods in order to broadcast, announcementsof special importance,(c) By decision of the Cabiney these broadcasting periods must not belonger than 2 minutes each and must occur irregularly at intervals of notless than half an hour, the first such period to be a least half an hourafter the initial order to close down.1, Instructions -from C-in-C,. Home Farces,.in the event of p3.rachu.te_ Raids.02e On the 13th May, 1940 the War Cabinet had&apos;before them proposals by theSecretary of State for \Tar regarding the methods to be employed for dealing withparachute attacks,,     The third of these proposals was as follows:&quot;(iii)     The third measure for which authority was asked was that if parachutistswere landed in this country the C.-in-C, Home Forces, should be authorised to instruct the B0B.C  to broadcast instructions to troops.    This involved somedeparture drom the previous decision that the B. B.C. should not broadcast at times when air attack was being made against this country&quot;.These proposals were approved by the War Cabinet subject to furtherconsideration being given to the points raised in discussion.3. As this decision stands it means that the C.-in-C, Home Forces hasthe right to over-ride at- any time and to any extent the instructions givenby Fighter Conimand Headquarters to the B.B.C. to close down all transmitters.This is obviously a matter of grave concern to the Air Staff and it is under-stood that representatives of the Air Staff, War- Office and Home Forces are proposing to meet in the endeavour to arrive at a compromise which will ensurethat the power given to the C^in-C,,, Home Forces? shall be used in such a way as to involve the smallest amount- of departure from the policy already approvedby the Cabinet in the interests of Air Defence.     In particular it is understoodthat Home Forces agree that instructions to be given   direct to the B.B.C. inthis way shall be confined to operational orders to troops arising out of an actual or threatened landing of parachutiste in this countryc4. The Ministry of Information and the 3.B.C. are not concerned with theproposed discussions between the Sendee Departments.     But in the meanwhile,and pending any further d.ecision by the Cabinet., the Minister of Information has given definite instructions to th0 B,3,C. to ^agt.^ijijjgcordance .vn.th.__theinstructions received from -the Cornraaiideiv-iri-Chief, HoT^..Forpes..This Committee is a reconstitution under the direction of the Ministry ofInformation,, of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence knownas the &quot;Document C&quot; Committee which reported to the C.I.D. in August 1939(C0I.D.Paper No015849B).     It includes representatives of the Ministry ofInformation the Air Ministry, the War Office, Home Securits&apos;-, Cabinet offices and B.BnCo with, the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Information as Chairman
Responsibility for seeing that instructions given in this way are confined to urgent operational orders must rest with G.-in-C., Home Forces. It isnot possible for the B.B.C. to distinguish between one kind of instructionand another.5.     It should be noted that between the hours of 0.30 and S.45.a.m., the    -B.B.C. stations are closed down.     When a transmitter is closed down it      litakes from 15 to 20 minutes to start it up ready to transmit a message.It is however possible to keep a transmitter running without radiating, andin that case a message can be transmitted within, say 3 minutes of noticebeing given to the engineers.     The extra cost Is in the neighbourhoodof  50 a night, but the saving of those 12 odd minutes is, thought.to be wellworth the money.     The matter being urgent, the Minister with the approvalof the Treasury, has instructed the B.B.C. to keep their transmitters runningall night henceforth pending any further directions.II.   Any other instructions of an Urgent Nature.6.     When the report of the Document lC Committee was prepared in August last it wasassummed that operational orders might be issued,in the event of an air raid, from the Central War Room.     It is under-stood that it is no longer intended that any operational orders shouldbe issued from the Central War Room and that it is not expected thatany such orders will be broadcast on the instructions of any other person or body than the C.-in-C., Home Forces.7,     On this assumption, with the single exception of C.-in-C.,HomS Forces, it is proposed to adhere strictly, even in time of anemergency such as an air raid, to the arrangement approved by the civil defence Committee last week under which all official broadcast announce-ments are to be communicated to the B.B.C. by the Ministry of Informa-tion on behalf of the Government Department from which they originate,and the B.B.C. are under strict instructions to accept no communicationwhatever for announcement from any other Government Department except the Ministry,   h8.     Pending confirmation by the War Cabinet, instructions havebeen given to the B.B.C. to act accordingly.     It will be observed thatthis means that if in time of emergency the Prime Minister, or any other member of the War Cabinet, should wish to give instructions to ibh*j B.B.C.to issue an announcement, that announcement should be conveyed to theB.B.C. through the Ministry of Information and not direct.9.     It is recommended that the authority of the War Cabinet be obtained for the Minister to give instructions   to the B.B.C.at his discretion tore-open the transmitters during any closed-down period in order to broadcastannouncements of special importance provided that the conditions laid downby the Cabinet (see para. 1 (c) above) are observed.sAt the request of the First Lord of the Admiralty, the minister has agreed that, under normal conditions, the Hydrographer&apos;s Navigationalwarnings to mariners may continue to be communicated direct to the B.B.C.,subject to a proper check by the latter on the authenticity of the message,jhit this exception cannot be allowed when all transmitters are closed downowing to enemy raids.   If at such a time the Admiralty wish to send a message of this kind they must ask-the Ministry of Information to transmit;the B.B.C. will refuse to accept it otherwise.   The Ministry&apos;s action will then conform with para 9 below.
III. Risk of Enemy Interference.10.     There is a grave risk that, at asgr time when all the B.B.C.transmitters in any one of the Home Service Groups are closed down, -theenemy may seize the opportunity to broadcast on one of our Home Servicewavelengths, from Hilversum, or some other powerful station near this  -&apos;country, false news or announcements to United Kingdom listeners, purporting to issue from the B.B.C. itself,   It must bs assumed that the enemy announcerwill be able to disguise his voice so as to be thought to be one of theregular B.B.C. announcers.11.     There appear to be no technical means of preventing the enemyfrom doing this, except by keeping cur own transmitters going continuously.But that would be a reversal of the air defence policy which was carefullythought out before the war and has been acted upon ever since, and at thisstage at any rate it cannot be recommended.12.     The problem therefore is how to minimise the effect of the assumed enemy action.     This has been carefully considered by the Departmentsrepresented on the Committee.     The following points should be noted:(a) It is conceivable that one or all of. our transmitters maybe closed down continuously under the orders of Fighter Command H.Q. fora very considerable period, possibly many hours.(b) The enemy may have two alternative purposes in mind.   First,he may hope to create panic and confusion by conveying false news or falseinstructions.     Secondly, he may hope that by doing so he will induce us to start up our transmitters in order to jam his broadcast and thereby will obtain direction-finding assistance&quot; at the moment when ib would be mosthelpful to his raiding air-craft.(c) In any warning or instruction which we may give to thepublic it is desirable; .- .(i)   to.avoid using language which will create a generaldistrust of B.3.C. announcementsj(ii)    not to show our hand to the enemy or to suggest to himweakness in our organisation.     It may not, however, bepossible to av/oid this latter risk altogether.(d) It is understood that during daylight on a cloudless day the additional direction-finding assistance that would be given to an enemyraider by keeping the transmitters on during a raid would be negligible^It is hoped therefore that the Air Ministry will be willing to give instruc-tions to Fighter Command H.Q. that under such conditions they shall notorder the B.B.C. to close down transmitters.(e) Between midnight and 6-45 a,^ most listeners normally turnoff their receivers.   It must be assumed however that many will turn them on in time of a raid.(f) The problem therefore relates tc (i) daylight hours, wheneverthere is cloud or mist:    (ii) hours of darkness until 12 midnight;   (iii)the following hours for a limited number of listeners only.13.     It is understood that the Air Ministry are now prepared to agree that,in the event of the enemy attempting to broadcast on one of our wave-lengthswhile we are off the air, the BoB30, may re-open their transmitters in order(.      to issue a very brief message of mrning to home listeners, to be repeatedat quite short intervals, provided that(a) the message occupies not mere than half-a-minute; and(b) it is repeated at irregular intervals of not less than (say)3 minutes.
- 4 -The message should be a spoken earning, in a fom to be agreed between the 3.B.C. and the Ministry beforehand; its delivery in thisway will have the effect of fanning, but should be nore effective,although only a comparatively few listeners will understand what issaid,It Hay be that the enemy will be provoked by this to jan our ownbroadcasts later, but we must take that risk.This concession by the Air Ministry will be of great help.   Evenif only a few listeners are able actually to understand what the B.B.C.announcer says when he interrupts, the interruptions will serve as a warning to listeners that scoething is wrong and that they should actwith great caution.14.   The action which the Committee recommend is as follows;(i) That the Minister of Inf creation should broadcastimmediately a carefully-worded warning in which the public will be reminded of the enemy technique in this respect, with examplesfrom Poland, Norway, Holland and Belgium.It should be explained to them that, in the event of serious air-raids in this country, It may be necessary for the3.3.C. to *fade cut5 their programme suddenly, without any warning,perhaps in the middle of an item.   If that should happen, listenersmust take it as a warning, and oust be on their guard against enemyattempts to deceive them in the interval before the 3.3.C. resume their continuous programme.   Listeners may be reminded, in particu-lar, that between 0.30 and 6.45 a.m. there is no B.3.C. programme,and that no announcement whatever is or will be made by the 3.B.C.to the public between these hours.    (There nay be some announce-ments, but they will not concern the public, who should ignore then)(ii) That the B.B.C. should advise the Duty Room Officer ofthe Ministry of Information henceforth whenever one complete group of transmitters is closed dam by order of Eigbts? Command.(iii) That the B.3.C. should establish a listening post fcrth-with, to listen for enemy interference on British wave-lengths. Ifthis should be detected,(a) the Duty Rocs Officer of the Ministry will be immediately informed and will in turn inform the Minister ofInformation.(b) The listening post will at the same time informthe Senior Control Room Engineer, and Programme Assistant, B.B.G.The former will immediately, without waiting for further instructions, open up all transmitters, under the conditionsdescribed in para. 13 above, for a series of brief announcementsby the Programme Assistant in the agreed form, to be continued at irregular intervals as long as the enemy interference lasts.(c) This procedure will not apply during the ldeadfhours between 0.30 and 6.45 a.m., since listeners will already havebeen informed that no 3.3.C. announcements whatever will be made tothe public in those hours.(d) In the event of C. -in-C., Hcae Forces, givinginstructions to the 3.3.C, to &quot;broadcast an operational order totroops while the enemy is occupying our wave-lengths, his instructions must have precedence over those deliberate interrupti&quot;of the enemy broadcast.   It may not be easy for the Home Forcesinstructions to be heard under such conditions, and it would be well that they should be repeated.   An excess over the 2 minutes limit is less likely to be dangerous while the enemy is also broadcasting.
- 5 -171&apos; (iv) That the position be further reviewed after the first occasion on. which such enemy interference occurs, in order to decide what further precautions, if any, should be taken.15.   It has been suggested that as an additional precaution,the B.B.C, should, whenever all transmitters are closed down, send out Home News on a short-wave length such as 49 metres, which is new usedpartly for broadcasting to European countries and partly for the\ Smpire Service.   Although only a very few - perhaps not more than 10%of TJ.K, receiver sets can be timed so as to receive this wave-length,it would be possible to arrangs. that a number of important focalcentres, such as Town Halls, pc-Iice, Regional Cnnrtissioners and the regional Information. Officers of&quot; this Ministry, should be equipped with sets capable of receiving such a wave-length, and should be instructed secretly to tune in to it during an air-raid. It appears thattransmitters on such low wave-lengths axe not likely to be used by theeneqy for direction-finding purposes, and messages could, therefore, besent out on it- continuously during a raid.   On the other hand its use forthis purpose will disturb the Overseas Service.   The B.B. C. have beenasked to look into the question further before it is decided to adopt it.16.   The CcE53ittee cannot advise that these precautions are entirely satisfactory.   The enemy cay lead from several alternative cards in his hand and if he plays skilfully it will be difficult to forestall himentirely when air raids first begin.   It will,. therefore, be necessaryto review the position ioned lately after the first occasion on which heuses this technique in order to see what further act! n may have to betaken.Signed on behalf of the Cccrn/bteeA. p.
