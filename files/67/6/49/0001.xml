Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1940.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 149.June 12, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE ARAB STATES AND PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE accompanying memorandum deals with a question of great importance for our position in the Middle East, about which tlhe War Cabinet gave directions as recently as last Eebruary, but which I think it right to bring up once again in view of the recent developments in the Middle East.I hope I shall have the approval of my colleagues for the policy suggestedtherein, which has the support of the Secretary of State for the Colonies andwhich is, I am convinced, essential if serious dangers are to be avoided.IN May 1939 His Majesty&apos;s Government adopted a policy, now commonlycalled the &quot; White Paper &quot; policy, which they regarded as constituting the bestpractical solution of the Palestine problem which was possible in the absence of* direct agreement between the Arabs and the Jews. According to this policy,Jewish immigration was to be limited to 10,000 a year for five years, with theaddition of 25,000 refugee immigrants; no further immigration to be permittedafter the five-year period unless the Arabs of Palestine were prepared to acquiesce :the sale of land by Arabs was to be regulated : and changes of a constitutionalnature were to begin as soon as peace and order in Palestine were sufficientlyrestored. The object of these changes was the establishment of an independentPalestine State at the end of ten years if various conditions designed to safeguard the Jewish National Home and British strategic interests were fulfilled.2. Since then Jewish immigration has been controlled in accordance withthe White Paper, and regulations known as the Land Transfers Regulationshave been enacted. But so far no constitutional developments have taken place.This is because His Majesty&apos;s Government have never yet felt that the&apos;momenthad come when &quot; peace and order&quot; were &quot; sufficiently restored.&quot;3. The question of continuing the White Paper policy was considered bythe War Cabinet some months ago as the result of suggestions from Zionistquarters that it ought to be suspected because of the war.H.Foreign Office, June 12, 1940.Memorandum.11061   [21396]
4. As a result telegraphic instructions were sent to Lord Lothian on the17th February, 1940,(1) as to the line he should take with the American Zionistleaders.   This telegram contained the following passage :  &apos;&apos; For your own information, our reason for this substitution (for earlierinstructions) is that whilst we have not withdrawn from the policy statedin the White Paper, we are anxious not to arouse fresh controversies bya public reassertion of our position which might be considered provocative.&quot;5. As a corollary to the instructions to Lord Lothian, His Majesty&apos;representatives in the Arab States were told that while they should leave noenquirer in any doubt that His Majesty&apos;s Government intended to proceed withthe White Paper policy, they should so far as possible avoid references to thissubject and leave the actions of His Majesty&apos;s Government to speak for themselves.6. Hitherto this procedure has worked well enough, but recently thesituation in the Middle East, and particularly in Iraq, has grown much worseas the result of constant German successes, culminating in the drive to theChannel ports. German and Italian propaganda has for a long time past beenactively exploiting Arab sentiment about Syria and Palestine. German successhas made this propaganda effective. What is more, it has made it matter, forthe Arabs have largely lost confidence in the ability of the Allies to protect themand wish above all to be on the winning side.7. It is against this background that an appeal which has now beenreceived from General Nuri-as-Said, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign affairs and one who may be regarded as sincerely deploring the growing anti-british feeling, must be considered. He explains that the Iraqi Government are deeplyconcerned about public feeling in Iraq concerning Palestine and the mannerin which propaganda has been able to exploit that feeling, and goes on &quot;as a complement to the measures which are being taken by the Iraqi Govern-ment themselves to defeat enemy trickery, His Majesty&apos;s Government, and,if possible, the French Government as well, should issue a clear andunambiguous pronouncement guaranteeing immediately, or at least at the endof the war, the execution of promises already given for the organisation ofself-government in Palestine and Syria.&quot; (2)8. This presumably means that His Majesty&apos;s Government ought to repeattheir intention of carrying out the White Paper, adding, as a point of detail,that even if they cannot take the first steps up the constitutional ladder whilethe war lasts, they will, at any rate, do so when the war ends. Or it may mean that we ought to give an assurance that the safeguards referred to in paragraph 1above will not be used as an excuse to deny its independence to Palestine at theend of ten years. But whatever it may mean, I do not recommend, no matter what apparent grounds of expediency there may be, that we should make any new promise about Palestine to the Arabs, or for that matter to anyone else.Apart from anything else I do not think it would necessarily pay. It mightmerely encourage those Arabs who think they can use our present difficulties to secure further concessions.9. But while I do not suggest that we should say more than that we meanto do what we have already said we would do, I am sure we cannot say less. Itmay seem absurd that the Arabs should constantly doubt whether His Majesty&apos;sGovernment mean to carry on with the White Paper policy, but the fact remainsthat they do, partly because the German wireless keeps telling them that HisMajesty&apos;s Government have no intention of doing so. We are in effect asked,and we shall continue to be asked, whether the present Government mean to carry(!) See Annex.(2) The French and Syrian Governments signed a treaty in 1936 whereby Syria would receive independence on the model of Egypt and Iraq. The French Government have not yetratified that treaty, and regard the question of its ratification as indefinitely adjourned whilethe. war lasts. Although they doubtless mean to ratify the treaty one day, they would be most reluctant to make any pronouncement on the subject now. Anything of the kind would be anew promise (see paragraph 8). At the same time they will not mind what we say aboutPalestine. In fact they would be dismayed if they thought His Majesty&apos;s Government likelyto abandon the White Paper.
it out or not, and we must answer either &quot; Yes &quot; or &quot; No.&quot; To say &quot; No &quot; wouldprobably be fatal, and would not only cause grave reactions throughout the moslem world, but also reopen the chapter of disorder in the Middle East whichin large measure was closed by the White Paper policy.10. I therefore recommend that in reply to General Nuri&apos;s enquiry thefollowing answer should be given : &quot; The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government for Palestine continues to bethat laid down in the White Paper of May 1939. So far as the provisionsof the White Paper relating to immigration and land sales are concerned,these matters are already being regulated in accordance with those provi-sions. So far as constitutional development is concerned, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have not so far been able to regard peace and order as sufficientlyrestored for the first step to be taken, that is to say, for Palestinians to beappointed to take charge of some of the departments of the Administration.Nor do they think it likely that this step can be taken while the present warcontinues. But they hope and expect that when the war is ended conditionsin Palestine will quickly permit the various stages of constitutional develop-ment to follow one another on the lines which the White Paper lays down.&quot;11. Iii making this recommendation I do not overlook its probable effect onthe Zionists. But so far as the merits of the question are concerned I believe thatit will be kindest to the Zionists in the long run to tell them the truth finally andplainly now, for, as I said when this problem was discussed in January, I do notthink any Government of this country will, in fact, be able to do more for the zionists than is done in the White Paper. So far as mere expediency is concerned,things have changed since January. The Arab world is now in a dangerous state,while it is clear that the American attitude towards the war (which is the pointon which stress was laid in the January discussions) is swayed for better orworse by arguments and emotions over which the Zionists cannot hope to exercise any but the smallest influence.H.June 12, 1940.ANNEX.Viscount Halifax to the Marquess of Lothian (Washington).(No. 252.)(Telegraphic.)   Extract. Foreign Office, February 17, 1940.MY telegram No. 16 [of 4th January : Palestine].His Majesty&apos;s Government have now decided to authorise the HighCommissioner for Palestine to issue regulations controlling sales of land byArabs to non-Arabs as contemplated in white paper of May 1939. In my immediately following telegram I am communicating to you an outline of these regulations. Following paragraphs of this telegram contain material for youruse in explaining situation to Dr. Brandeis and his friends, if you think thisdesirable. It seems to us that courtesy may require this explanation in view of theterms of their telegram of 15th November, but you may think it unnecessary and undesirable to make such an approach to them. This material will, in any case,enable you to deal with any other Jewish representations. It should be substi-tuted for observations contained in my suspended telegram No. 943, of which no public use should be made. For your own information, our reason for thissubstitution is that, whilst we have not withdrawn from the policy stated in thewhite paper, we are anxious not to arouse fresh controversies by a publicreassertion of our position which might be considered provocative. You shouldnot, in any event, give following information to Dr. Brandeis or others until day before the Land Regulations are being published in Palestine, and then only for
their confidential information, and not for publication. If Dr. Weizmann is in or near Washington, I should be grateful if you could convey same to him con-fidentially. I will let you know as soon as possible date of publication of LandRegulations, which will be in near future.2. It is generally recognised that the outbreak of war has projected intointernational affairs new considerations of paramount importance. In the opinionof His Majesty&apos;s Government, the fate of civilisation hangs on the issue of thewar, and the German treatment of Jews shows conclusively that a happier future for world Jewry depends on the victory of the Allies.3. Recognition by the people of Palestine of these tremendous issues and ofthe fact that Jews and Arabs have a common interest in the defeat of NaziGermany has brought about a cessation of strife and new disposition to co-operate in that country. His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious not to disturb this stateof affairs, and they would have preferred it, if it had been possible, to postponefor the duration of the war any action in Palestine which might tend to revivepolitical controversy.4. But the land situation presents a special problem of exceptional difficulty and urgency. The status quo is not being maintained, for sales of land are still proceeding without regulation, and, as will be shown, the situation is being con-tinuously altered in a way which is likely to present His Majesty&apos;s government before long with a state of affairs calculated to prejudice gravely prospects ofagreement between Jews and Arabs.^fe $fc *tt 4t
