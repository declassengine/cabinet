A Committee was accordingly set up under theChairmanship of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and consisting of representatives of the Foreign Office, the Ministry of economic warfare and other Departments.2. Attached is a detailed analysis (Annex I) of the position as it presentsitself to the Committee: it appears that we have a choice of adopting one oftwo policies : (a) To make a further attempt to reach an agreement with the Italians, or(b) To abandon any idea of reaching an agreement and instead to make our contraband control and economic warfare at least as effective inregard to Italy as a non-belligerent as in regard to minor powers asneutrals.The choice between these two policies is as follows : 3.   The first &quot;policy would not ensure Italy staying out of the war but wouldmake it less likely that she would come in at an early date; at the same time it10992   [21165] b
would make Italian stocks a temptation to Germany, prolong delay in the effectiveness of our blockade against Germany, and ensure that Italy would be stronger if she entered the war against us at a later date.4. The second policy would definitely incur the risk of an early explosionon the part of Signor Mussolini, with all that this involves politically andstrategically, but should on the other hand weaken Italy&apos;s capacity to participate in a war against us and should render our blockade of Germany more effective.i 5. While the purely blockade point of view calls for the adoption of thesecond policy (alternative (b)), the political and strategical risks at this momentinvolved are not likely to be ignored.6. In these circumstances it is clear that to adopt alternative (b) wouldland us into a position from which it would be difficult to retreat if things wentbadly in Scandinavia or elsewhere, whereas the adoption of alternative (a) inthe manner suggested below would always leave us free to switch to alternative (b)if events caused us to feel confident that we could do so without untowardconsequences.7. For this reason it is recommended that for the moment alternative (a)be adopted cautiously and subject to the following overriding considerations :  (a) That we should give away nothing that would unduly increase Italy&apos;swar potential, whether materially or financially, and that we should endeavour to obtain an adequate quid pro quo.(b) That we should in no circumstances give the Italians the impression that we were making advances which might be misinterpreted as a sign of weakness.(c) That we should endeavour to bring the French Government into line withthis policy.8.   In order to give effect to the foregoing, it is recommended that:  (i) So far as contraband policy is concerned, no approach should be madeto the Italians over State Guarantees, but that we should show a readiness-ness to examine any proposals they may make should they take theinitiative in raising the matter with us; and that on our side weshould seek to tighten up our control in an unostentatious mannerby negotiating agreements with well-disposed concerns and by treatingill-disposed concerns with severity when justified by valid evidence.(ii) The French Government should be approached with a view to betterco-ordination in controlling the flow of war material from the Britishand French Empires to Italy.(iii) An endeavour should be made to reach a conclusion in the negotiationsnow in progress to place an order for a number of merchant ships in italy.(iv) Instructions should be sent to the Treasury representative now in Romeauthorising him to conclude a clearing agreement on the basis of accepting the fundamental points on which the Italians have insisted(see Rome telegram No. 350 (Annex III)), provided that the distribu-tion of the proceeds of normal (as opposed to &quot; special &quot;) purchasesis not less favourable to us than the existing arrangements,(v) The present guarantee facilities for Italian purchases of their require-ments of coal should be continued for the time being up to the rateof 4 million tons a year provided that the arrears in payment are notconsiderably increased,(vi) We should maintain or increase our purchases of horticultural produce in so far as we need such produce, since our purchases are likely tohave a considerable political effect, and from the foreign exchangepoint of view lire purchases are preferable to dollar purchases.H.R. C.
ANNEX I.Relations with Italy, with particular reference to Contraband Conttol.SINCE the outbreak of war in September the declared attitude of Italy hasbeen one of &quot; non-belligerency.&quot; This means at the lowest that Italy, although a declared Ally of Germany, takes no part in the conflict but does not disinterestherself from it or from the eventual peace settlement, and, meanwhile, seeks tosecure economic advantages from both sides.* The Italian Government haveuntil recently carefully abstained from adopting any markedly favourableinclination towards either belligerent. During the past few weeks, however,there have been signs that Italy has been withdrawing from sympathy with theAllies (the breakdown of our own negotiations in February was the first definitesign of this) and has been gradually modifying her attitude in a sense favourable to Germany, probably as a result of the Brenner meeting. The chief tangibleevidence of the latter development is the decidedly anti-Allied tone taken on bythe Italian press and broadcasts, and, in particular, the support universally givenby the Italian press during the last few days to the German aggression onDenmark and Norway. The possibility of an Italian move, e.g., in the Adriatic,should the Allies fare badly in the North and in the West, cannot be excluded.2. An overt change in Italy&apos;s attitude dates from the visits of Herr vonBibbentrop and Herr Hitler to Italy, and is doubtless to be ascribed to Germanthreats and success in persuading the Italian Government that it is to their interests to give Germany greater support than hitherto.3. These developments, though symptomatic of the present Italian desire notto be drawn into a pro-Allied policy, need not necessarily be taken as an indication of an ultimate Italian intention to enter the war on the side of Germany, and,in particular, the pro-German tone of the Italian press may have been engineered,as has been done in the past, for technical purposes in order to increase Italiannuisance value abroad and counteract the swing of public opinion at home away from Germany.4. Decisions in such matters still rest solely with Signor Mussolini. Aquestion which at once suggests itself is whether the Duce can be certain of thesupport of the country if he decides to enter the war on Germany&apos;s side.Count Ciano and most of Signor Mussolini&apos;s expert advisers, including MarshalBadoglio, though not apparently all his other military advisers, are against war on Germany&apos;s side. The same is true of the King, of Catholic opinion and theopinion of the people as a whole, particularly in the industrial north. signor mussolini, on the other hand, can rely on the loyalty of the Fascist party, which,although it contains a minority who are critical of his leadership, consists to agreat extent of young men who would unswervingly follow his lead whatever their private sentiments might be. Signor Mussolini would also have the powerful backing of the rural population in Italy, whose needs he has alwaysbeen careful to foster. It is thus by no means safe to assume that Signor Mussoliniwould not be able to carry the Italian people with him in the event of a decisionto enter the war on Germany&apos;s side, and this, no doubt, is a factor which ispresent in his own mind. On the other hand, the fundamental difficulties ofItaly&apos;s strategic position remain, and these are not likely to be forgotten bySignor Mussolini. With the control of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal, Italy&apos;soversea trade can be completely stopped; and the new African Empire wouldbe a pledge in the hands of the Allies. Signor Mussolini is, therefore, not likelyto cast in his lot with Hitler unless and until he believes that the Allies are onthe point of collapse. Then he would undoubtedly wish to come in for his shareof the booty.5. In any case, the background against which the question of the expediency of reopening economic negotiations with Italy has to be examined is that of a country which, ostensibly at least, is being led by its dictator into an attitude ofincreasing unfriendliness towards the Allies.* The implications of the conception of non-belligerency are by no means clear, and areexamined in Annex II.[21165]
6. The present position of our economic relations with Italy is unsatis-factory, since they are not governed by any positive policy. At present theapplication of contraband control in regard to Italy is satisfactory neither so faras Italy herself is concerned nor in relation with our policy towards other neutrals.Our control of contraband and enemy exports, in practice as applied to Italy, is becoming increasingly ineffective. Evidence of some leakage of imports throughItaly is accumulating, and this leakage, according to current information, is likelyto become more serious. Further, there is evidence of German exports passing through Italy on a considerable scale. Nor should we forget that imports into italy have already improved her war potential since September 1939.7. The Italian authorities, in matters of control machinery, have on thewhole been not unhelpful, but we have been forced to adopt a regime in handlingItalian ships and cargoes which has exposed us to the criticism in neutral countries that we have shown favour to Italy, as to other first-class Powers notengaged in the war, because we were frightened of them. In the absence of adecision to tighten up our contraband control as regards Italy, we lack the moralground for tightening it elsewhere. Thus our contraband control policy towardsItaly is to some extent the keystone of our general contraband policy.8. Any further development of contraband traffic through Italy (and thereis considerable evidence that Germans, Italians and neutrals alike are busydevising means to foster it) will inevitably create a source of supply which islikely to have serious strategic consequences. This leakage, actual and potential,should clearly be taken into account when considering the value to us of keepingItaly out of the war. The longer the present state of affairs continues, the greater the leakage and the more Italian stocks will accumulate, until a country whichwas admittedly not in a position a few months ago to be a serious opponent maywell achieve that position.9. The existing situation is thus unsatisfactory. It not only fails to satisfy the Italians, but also hampers our general policy of contraband control and seriously interferes with our economic warfare against Germany.10. At the moment two alternative lines of policy appear to be open to us :either (a) To make a further attempt to reach an agreement with the Italians; or(b) To abandon any idea of reaching an agreement and instead make our contraband control and economic warfare at least as effective inregard to Italy as a non-belligerent as in regard to minor Powers asneutrals.It is assumed that, in coming to a decision as to which of these two policiesshould be adopted, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be largely influenced by theconsideration as to which of the two is the more likely to contribute to keepingItaly out of the war. It is here relevant to observe that the Chiefs of Staff, in amemorandum of the 26th March on &quot; certain aspects of the present situation,&quot;have given it as their opinion that &quot; the intervention of Italy on the side ofGermany would greatly complicate our difficulties,&quot; and have recommended that,if, as may be the case, Italy is at the cross-roads, &quot; all possible steps should betaken to ensure that she moves in the right direction.&quot;11.   It seems to follow that (i) If it were decided to attempt to reach agreement, our object in doing so would be to build up for ourselves so favourable a body of opinion in Italy as to make Signor Mussolini entertain doubts as to his ability to carry his population with him should he desire to intervene in thewar against us, though at the same time we should wish to keep herwar potential as low as is possible consistently with the first objective.(ii) If, on the other hand, it were decided to make our contraband control andeconomic warfare policy really effective, our object would be toincrease our economic pressure on Germany. It would at the sametime be our object to prevent Italian war potential, which at itspresent level is thought to be insufficient for her entry into a major war, from reaching a point where Italy would be able to contemplate
this, subject always to the clanger of taking any action which couldsuccessfully be represented as an economic &apos;&apos; sanction &quot; at a moment when this would be politically unwise.12. Both these alternative policies present certain positive advantages. Thefirst policy would seek to ensure Italian neutrality at this stage of the war, but would not obviate the certainty that after a longer or shorter interval Italy wouldhave increased her effectiveness for war. This fact, however, would be counter-balanced to some extent by the growing strength of Turkey. The chief riskinherent in the alternative course would be that of provoking an immediateexplosion on the part of Signor Mussolini, though it is by no means certain thatsuch an explosion would occur so long as the state of Italian economic conditionsremains as precarious as it now is, and a restrictive policy would certainly render it even more precarious.13.   These two alternative policies will now be examined in more detail.Alternative A.(To make a further attempt to reach an agreement with the Italians.)14. We have already tried negotiation and have failed. It may beinstructive to examine the circumstances which led to this failure, since anotherattempt at agreement may be more successful if the negotiations are conducted on a different basis.15. The ostensible, and probably chief, reason was because we insisted thatthe goods supplied by Italy should include a high proportion of war material.Any insistence on the supply of war material as such in the future is thus doomedto failure. It is debatable how far, apart from political considerations, aneconomic agreement without the supply of war material presents positiveattractions, unless certain manufactured goods, such as ships, which we reallyneed can be obtained. It is, however, clear that if we are to succeed in doing anything in the future, exchanges more limited in scale and scope than were contemplated in February are inevitable.16. The second lesson to be learnt is that much concern and annoyance was caused in Italy by what appeared to be unnecessary delays and lack ofco-ordination between different Government Departments here.17. Lastly, we tried to combine a number of issues in a single negotiationwhich, as events showed, was bound to fail if any one element proved to bean insuperable obstacle.18. It may be inferred from this that any resumed negotiations involving a wide range over the economic and commercial fields should be co-ordinated inLondon and between London and Paris, and should be conducted under a singledirection (e.g., a Committee such as that which has met to prepare the present memorandum), which will allow of a greater efficiency in negotiation. Thispolicy should aim at achieving so far as possible a combination of commercialexchanges with some limitation of Italian purchasing power and re-stocking,which might be effected by regulating the sale of raw materials from Britishand French domestic and Imperial sources. Even without applying the contra-band control machinery for this purpose we could at any rate limit the supplyof essential raw materials from Allied sources. But it is useless to embark onthis policy if the French pursue an unmethodical purchase policy and continueto seek to buy on the widest possible scale in Italy and to supply raw materials,some of them from British sources, the export of which to Italy we are engagedin trying to limit. French consent to this policy in its entirety would thereforebe essential..19. Our purchasing policy and that of the French, if this line is followed,should be directed to supplying our needs and at the same time to purchasingsuch goods as are likely to affect popular opinion in our favour. In this categoryare domestically produced agricultural products, the sale of which affects a largeproportion of the peasant population, and the construction of ships, the labourcontent of which is sufficiently high to ensure a satisfactory level of employmentin shipyards, &amp;c. &apos; &quot; ,[21165] &apos;   B 3
20. In the application of our contraband control machinery, we should seek to eliminate measures which allow ill-disposed firms to profit and alienate the sympathy of well-disposed concerns. We should rather seek to favour well-disposed firms and treat ill-disposed firms with severity. It might further benecessary to consider accepting some form of State Guarantee, if the Italiansproposed some system which appeared not less effective than the contraband control machinery in use at present. Whether the existing system were continued,or a State Guarantee system adopted, risk of leakages into or out of Germanyand accumulation of Italian stocks must be faced.21. This line, which we have called Alternative A, admittedly involvestaking some risks. We should probably have to place orders for ships, possiblyat.rather high prices, and provide the raw material for their construction, withour eyes open to the possibility that this raw material might be used by theItalians for themselves if the general situation developed unfavourably betweenthe United Kingdom and Italy.Alternative B.(To make our contraband control and economic warfare effective in Italy.)22. This alternative policy would aim at reducing to a minimum Italy&apos;svalue to Germany not only as a source of supply, but also as a possible belligerenton her side. In its practical application this policy involves the rigid enforcement of whatever contraband measures are available to us, including where necessary the imposition of forcible rationing.23. So far as reducing Italy&apos;s war potential is concerned, action wouldbe two-fold. In the first place our object would be as far as possible to suspend the supply to Italy of all strategic raw materials from Allied sources.24. The second way in which steps could be taken to reduce Italy&apos;s war potential is, to the extent that it is politically desirable and juridically defensible(see annex II), to use the machinery of contraband control, and particularly of rationing. The purpose of this would be to reduce Italy&apos;s imports of strategic raw materials to a level consonant with her immediate needs, thuspreventing the further accumulation of stocks which, if they were not transferredto Germany at a later date, might well eventually be used against us.25. The risks inherent in adopting alternative B are an immediate outburst of popular opinion in Italy which could be exploited by Signor Mussolini andmight bring Italy into the war against us at an early date. It is not, of course,certain that such an outburst would result, or. if it did, that it would necessarilylead to Italian entry into the war. In this connexion it is worth noting thatthe feeling in the Industrial North is reported as growing less favourable tothe Allies, due in part to failure to reap the benefits anticipated from some tradesettlement. In any case it can safely be said that the immediate risks of Italygoing against us are undeniably greater than if we were to adopt alternative A.On the other hand alternative B, if vigorously applied, might have the effect ofmaintaining Italian economy in a state in which active participation in a major war would be very difficult.26. Whether we adopt alternative A or alternative B, it should be our object to deal with the negotiations about a Clearing Agreement and the exportcredit guarantee facilities in respect of coal for Italy in such a way as will,on the one hand, avoid unreasonable concessions which would strengthen Italy&apos;swar potential and at the same time weaken our own war effort, and, on theother hand, avoid a political explosion such as might result if we were completelyto cut off the export credit facilities or to break off the clearing negotiations,without going as far as we reasonably can to meet the Italian views.27. In giving special facilities for the export of United Kingdom coal toItaly, we are undoubtedly assisting Italy in a way which would make it easier for Signor Mussolini to go to war with us if he decides to do so. At the sametime, contracts have been concluded to cover 4 million tons and, provided thatthe amount of coal shipped is kept within these limits, and that the delays in
payments do not increase considerably, it seems wiser to retain these special facilities for the time being rather than to provoke an explosion by cuttingthem off.28. As regards the Clearing, the Italians are anxious to use as much aspossible of their sterling for raw materials and to obtain our agreement to certainpayments being made to Italy by France in the form of sterling, which can alsobe used for raw materials. The Italians insist that our &quot;special&quot; purchasesmust be separate from our &quot; normal &quot; purchases, and that the sterling paids tothem in respect of special purchases shall be available for raw materials whichcan be purchased in sterling. Our object, on the other hand, is to secure thatas large a part as possible of the Italians&apos; sterling is used to cover their purchases of United Kingdom goods and their financial debts in the United Kingdom. our special purchases represent raw materials, such as hemp, mercury and sulphur,and also ships. The Italians can probably find a ready sale for such goods, andit does not seem on the whole unreasonable that they should stipulate that weshould pay them in the form of sterling which can be used for raw materials.But we can reasonably insist that all, or nearly all of the sterling derived from our normal purchases should be used for United Kingdom goods (including bothcoal and a reasonable proportion of manufactured goods). Therefore no new arrangement should be made in regard to the proceeds of normal purchases whichare less advantageous to us than the existing arrangements. If the Italians areprepared to make a clearing agreement without waiting to see how military andpolitical events develop, they will probably be prepared to accept an agreement on the above terms. If, however, they are not prepared to make any reasonableclearing agreement for the time being, we can only suspend negotiations as quietlyas possible in the hope that they can be resumed later on. Instructions on theabove lines are, in agreement with the departments concerned, being sent toMr. Playfair, the Treasury representative in Rome.ANNEX II.Prepared by the A attorney-General after discussion with the Master of the Rolls,the Procurator-General, the Legal Advisers to the Foreign Office andthe Minister for Economic Warfare.(1) CONTRABAND control is directed to stopping contraband goodsreaching the enemy. If the goods are consigned to a neutral port the justification for seizure and placing in Prize is presumed enemy destination. There is no legalbasis in the rules of contraband for preventing goods reaching a neutral uponthe ground that they will be used for increasing the stocks actually required forher own purposes, whatever those purposes may be.A large increase of imports by a neutral adjacent to a belligerent may inmany cases well be regarded as raising a presumption that some of the increase isdue to a passing on of some of the consignments to the enemy. The statisticalevidence, though it may justify seizure, is in the absence of other evidence nota good basis for condemnation, as the Prize Court is concerned with the particularcargo. The fact that some cargoes are going to the enemy does not in itselfshow that the particular cargo is so destined, although if the increase is sufficiently great it may shift the onus of.proof and place on the claimant theburden of showing that the destination is not enemy. The net result is that theultimate legal sanction behind a forcible rationing system is unsatisfactory;nevertheless the existence of sufficiently large imports may well afford fulljustification for the seizure of cargoes and investigation. This would be greatlyreinforced where there was evidence of leakage to the enemy and also where theneutral, as in the case of Italy, was known to be in especially close touch withhim.In the ordinary case of a country with a large increase in imports, it istherefore possible (legally) to detain, hold up, or seize cargoes for a time and prevent them in practice reaching their original destination.   It must always be
sremembered also that a rationing system can to a great extent be worked byindirect means such as arrangements with overseas exporters, refusal of navi-certs, &amp;c, which avoid the necessity for actual seizure in prize.In principle, therefore, the possibility of rationing a country on a purelycontraband basis need not, from a legal point of view, be ruled out.(2) In the special case of Italy the practical point which arises may be thusexplained. Italy has in practice submitted to our contraband control. If weseize a cargo in relation to which we have some evidence of enemy destinationother than a mere inference from statistics, we have a practical answer to anydiplomatic representations which may be made by Italy in reference to thatcargo. If, however, the only ground upon which we detain the cargo is a statistical one, the answer to a diplomatic representation becomes more difficult.We might reply merely that we had reason to suspect enemy destination and thatthe matter must be decided by the Prize Court. This would be met in the moreimportant cases by a statement that a guarantee had been given or would begiven by the appropriate para-statal body or corporation, and this might leadto a difficult situation. If the seizure were followed by others, it would become clear to the Italians, who are extremely sensitive on the subject of sanctions, thatwe were endeavouring to limit her imports not because we had genuine reasonto suspect enemy destination, but because we desired to do so on other groundsnot connected with contraband control at all, e.g., limiting her war potential orputting economic pressure on her with a view to influencing her policy. this latter point is also one on which the Italians are very sensitive. In practice,therefore, the seizure of goods consigned to Italy on purely statistical evidencewould probably lead to a difficult political situation which could not be met bypurely legal argument, since the Italians would never accept a purely statisticalexplanation of our action. The result is that the question of applying to Italya rationing system based on statistical considerations becomes, from a practical point of view, a political and not a legal one.&apos;(3) The matter can be approached from a point of view not concerned withcontraband. If one assumes that a declared neutral was building up stocks forthe purpose at a later stage of coming into the war against us, control or stoppage of her imports for this purpose would have to be on political grounds. Suchaction might be regarded as proper under general international principles, butthere would be no legal basis for a condemnation by the Prize Court as contra-band. It would be an act of the Government to be justified on political grounds and, so far as International Law is concerned, would be a measure of restraintshort of war, which might, of course, be treated by the country against which itwas directed as a casus belli.(4) The above is on the basis that Italy is to be regarded as a neutral. also it is not, of course, dealing with goods originating in Allied territory, the tradein which is under our own control. The rationing of such goods can be effected by other means.(5) Italy has declared that she is not a neutral, but a non-belligerent. Thisis a new expression invented by Italy herself for which there is no precedent in international Law or practice. Italy alone can explain what she means by it;failing any explanation by her, the only means of ascertaining her meaning isby drawing inferences from her behaviour. It might be pertinent to ask whetherthe expression means that she accepts the obligations of neutrality or, if not,what her position is. This might assist in the proof of presumed-Germandestination of cargoes, but the purpose of this paragraph is to consider the matter on wider grounds. Either the label which she has attached to herself, or her acts,might entitle us to treat her as in some middle region between neutrality andbelligerency. Obviously in these circumstances no reasonable criticism could bedirected against us merely for not treating her in all respects as a neutral. Thepolitical argument is clear, but the question arises whether this would afford any basis for applying Prize Court procedure to cargoes destined for her which itwas not suggested had an enemy destination.If a country adjacent to an enemy voluntarily allowed that enemy facilities in the prosecution of the war which Was in breach of neutrality obligations, one might reach a stage when it would be justifiable to notify the world that her territory would for contraband purposes be treated as enemy territory. she could, of course, treat this as a casus belli. Short of this, Prize Court condemn a-tion would have to be sought on wholly novel grounds.   Though no doubt ano
argument could be presented, it would, so far as one can predict, be unlikely to succeed. A country adopting or seeking to adopt this intermediate position couldlegitimately be asked to declare herself either a neutral or a belligerent. If shedeclined to declare herself neutral, she could on recognised grounds be treated asan enemy. Or measures of restraint short of war could be applied which she in her turn could treat as a casus belli.ANNEX III.Sir N. Charles to Viscount Halifax. [Received April 11.)(No. 350.)(Telegraphic.) Rome, April 11, 1940.FOLLOWING from Playfair :-&quot; My telegram No. 348.&quot;At the meeting to-day with Masi he said he had been unable tofind a solution along the lines we wanted though he had worked hard todo so. He therefore had prepared counter-proposals as it would be necessary,first of all, to reach agreement on three points of fundamental importance.&quot; 2. First point was the separation of special from normal purchases.Italy&apos;s need for raw materials was such that they must insist that payment for the former should go to the special account, subject perhaps to a per-centage not above 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, going to the coal account.He was anxious if possible to raise the takings of coal for the rest [ ? ofthe year] from 100,000 tons a month to 150,000 tons.&quot;Secondly, he must insist on the transfer of account [? in] francsto the special account of sterling though an upper limit could be discussed.&quot; Thirdly, he said in spite of many attempts by himself and hiscolleagues he had been unable to arrive at a solution of clearing ratequestion which did not infringe the dollar principle which they could notbreak. He did not hide his sympathy with the idea: he desires to findsuch a solution, but said it must be ruled out on,grounds of principle.He said, however, that he regarded the price problem as an internal onewhich Italy would have to deal with by means of export bounties accordingto her present policy.&quot; 5. When I remarked that we, as a clearing country, did not getthe benefit of the existing premium on free currencies, he said there wereobvious grounds for distinguishing between us and the Balkans and that thesystem could be changed. It was wholly to their advantage to push normalexports to us.&quot;6. In view of your telegram No. 202 I did not answer the first two points, and further argument on the third seemed to me futile at least. i therefore informed him that I would convejr his proposals to you and seekfurther instructions.&quot;7. I did, however, point out to him that no solution was likely to be acceptable to you which left so little for (c) and (d), and which at thesame time gave an allocation for free sterling from a denuded clearing. i thought it certain that you would ask for increased allocation for the first two and probably that you would ask for abolition of the last which isa luxury item. Masi regarded the former question as one detail to be con-sidered later; on the latter he said that the allocation was small anddeprecated our negative attitude.&quot;
