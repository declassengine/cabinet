I circulate herewith, a note in reply to four points raised in the discussion in the War Cabinet on April i+th onthe subject of Italian oil stocks;    (W.M.  (uo) 8lst Conclusion53Minute 1);    adding some further relevant information in raypossession.I. SIZE OF STOCKSiThe total Italian stocks of oil, held in Italy, bicilyand Sardinia in recent years are believed, to have beenTonsOn   Jan. 1st 1937 70h,000On   Jan. 1st 1938 833,QUOOn   Jan. 1st 1939 l,luO,uouOn July   1st 1939 l,6uu,00USoon after the outbreak of war Italy began to increase her rate of importation and by March 1st 19*4-0, stocks had risentheseto over 2-g million tons. The composition of/ stocks is uncertain,and it is believed that they were made up as under:-TonsCrude ...  ............     6ou,UuoFuel and Diesel.......1,250,d00Aviation Benzine    ......      150,UuuMotor Benzine &amp;c    ......      58u, uuoTotal     2,580,uuuAdditions to stocks during March were 8o/lUO,uOu tons,making the total stocics on April 1st.about 2.7 million tons.From forward orders placed by Italy, proposed increases in storage capacity, and other indications, it is clear,that italy/(THIS BBGUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)Secret &apos;W.P.

Italy intends still further to increase her stocks, and, if nothing intervenes to interrupt her present programme, shewill, by the end of the year probably hold stocks of 3-4- - I+,million tons.The Cabinet has asked for information on the size of stocks held in Italy at the beginning of the Abyssiniancampaign.     From the report of the League of Nations Committeeof experts, the figure would seem to have been a minimum ofi+OCjOuO and a maximum of 80C,uuu tons - say 6oo,.CUU tons.      Inthis connection it may be worth noting that the Italian Forcesin Abyssinia consumed about 25,CCu tons of petroleum a monthduring the last five months of 1935*     The- Forces engaged,were, however, not large compared with those.which italy might be expected to mobilise in a European war and the figuregiven does not include expenditure by the Navy or transports.2&apos;  ITALIAN DOMESTIC CONbUMPTlUNConsumption of Petroleum products in Italy, includingnaval and commercial bunkers, has varied between 3 arLd 3imillion tons a year from 1933 to 1938.     Cf this total, about1.2 million tons was accounted for by hunkers, naval and commercial.Rations imposed since the outbreak of war, includingefforts to induce Italian ships to bunker at non-Italian ports,have reduced the rate of consumption, including that of theNavy and Armed Forces in the Mother country to about 22p,UU(tons a month, or 2.7 million tons a year.Vi/ere rationing to be enforced as strictly as in Germany,Italian minimum essential requirements in a first year of a european war may roughly be estimated at not more thanTonsNavy.........1 million -Army..........5       millionAir Force.......3       millionCivil.........1.75     million total     3.75     million tonsThe accuracy/

The accuracy of this estimate depends upon the natureof the war waged, hut, from what has been said above, it isclear that by the end of this year Italy may have built up astock of petroleum products sufficient for at least a year of war.3. LOCATION OF STORAGE CAPACITYThe latest information shows that the storage capacity in Italy, Sicily and Sardinia at the outbreak of war was about.9 million tons (including Government tanks of c.1.2 million tons).      In addition, the Government is reported to be buildingtanics of a further 1.2 million ton capacity and has instructedimporting Companies to build yet other tanks&quot; up to 800,OuC tonscapacity.Known storage capacity in the Italian Colonies is,Italian North Africa ....   ...    70,000 tonsItalian Last Africa    . 0.   ... 12o,OOu tonsDodecanese      ...  ....  ...    80,000 tonsThe location of tanics existing at the outbreak of waris known in some detail.     They are chiefly at the principalports, with others at refineries.      27/o of the total capacity is at Adriatic ports, 23^ in Sicily, IJ/o at Naples and iOyo at genoa and 10/b at Savona*     Looked at in another way, over 5070of the total capacity is to be found south of a line joiningNaples to Bari and 36^0 north of a line joining Leghorn and Ancona.The bulk of the new tankage to be erected by the importingCompanies will be put up at the principal refineriesVeniceFiumeTriesteSpeziaNaplesBariLeghornMilanThe location of the new Government tanks is not yet known, but that proportion of the new capacity intended to contain Benzine for the Army and Aviation spirit for the ^irForce/

Force is likely to be erected chiefly in Northern Italy.Any additional tanks for naval fuel oil will undoubtedly be erected at the principal naval bases,h-. ttvi.:LhN exports OF oil the balance of evidence available is against any considerable export of Italian oil to Germany since theoutbreak of war.      on the other hand there is direct evidenceof a transit of certain quantities, probably of luricating oil, to Germany via Trieste and Yugoslavia.     About 300 tonsleft Trieste for Munich and Vienna during the last ten days&apos;of February and there is evidence of further shipments during april.      It may, perhaps, be mentioned that the French put theleakage at a much higher figure, but have not yet been able tosubstantiate this.Exports to Switzerland, Yugoslavia and Hungary havetaicen place, although, in granting export licences, the ItalianGovernment broke its assurance given when a tanker reaches acontraband base, that the oil is intended for Italian domestic csumption only - a fact which the Italian Government has admitted -promising anew that further export contracts will only be madewith the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government.This export to neutral countries of oil refined in italy from imported crude is a means whereby Italy obtains freecurrency to pay for the chartering of neutral tanker tonnage(principally Norwegian; in order to increase the rate of import and, therefore, the rapidity with which Italian stocks can beincreased.     as Italy&apos;s imported, crude is paid for largely in kind and her exports of refined products in free currency, thelatter is available to meet the expenses of chartering.Information at present available shews that Italy proposeto import during 1940 at least 1 million tons in non-Italiantankers.      It is estimated that the cost of chartering this tonnage at present rates can be met by exporting as Benzineabout one third of their total cai^goes.pril 17th, 1940. (Initialled) R.H.C.
