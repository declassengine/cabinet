SECRET. &quot;W.P.(G)(40)  183.25TH APRIL,  194Q.WAR CABINET.SUGAR.Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I regard it as essential that our gold and foreign exchange resources should not be reduced by such measures as the purchase of 50,000 tons of foreign sugar to meet atemporary emergency.Both we and our Allies, the French, have anexcessively unfavourahle balance of trade and are using up our reserves at a rate which threatens exhaustion beforethe end of the third year of war.It was against this background that I felt bound toask the Ministry of Food, for further cuts in the amount of sugar allocated to manufacturing purposes, such as chocolate,confectionery and miscellaneous manufactures (e.g. icecreams).     I also suggested some cut in the ration of thoseserving with His Majesty&apos;s Forces, which I understood to be21 oz. at home and 24 oz. abroad, as compared with the civilian ration of 12 oz.The Minister of Food advances a number of reasons why such measures as this (some of which are being adopted)would not remove the necessity of reducing the domesticration to S oz.It is true&quot;also that since I last considered thematter, the position has become the more difficult in thatthe West Indian crop will be 60,000 tons less than was thenanticipated.I do not wish to contest the Minister&apos;s consideredview that, failing the import of 50,000 tons of sugar, itwill he necessary to reduce the ration to 8 oz.      But I mustexpress the conviction that, when we have to choose betweenreducing our consumption of sugar and expending aconsiderable amount in foreign exchange which inevitablybrings nearer the day when our resources become exhausted,the right course is to do without this sugar in whateverway is technically best and to effect this economy in foreign exchange.(Initialled)    J.S.Treasury Chambers,Whitehall,S.W.I.COPY NO.       \Z
