Pi Q KIIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.W.P.(G)(40)105. COPY NO. j^14TH APRIL.  1940.WAR CABINET.DIVERSION OF CIVIL PLYING BOATS FOR MILITARY DUTIES.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Air.1. The War Cabinet on 14th March (War Cabinet 68(40))considered a proposal put forward by my predecessor thatthe flying boats Cabot and Caribou - then on loan to theRoyal Air Force - and the three new &quot;G&quot; boats of improvedtype, should be permanently diverted to the Royal AirForce for deep-sea reconnaissance.2* The War Cabinet, after hearing the views of theother Departments interested in overseas air communications,agreed that:-(i) for the time being, no further civil flying boats should be diverted for military duties;i.e. for the present Cabot and Caribou shouldcontinue in service with the Royal Air Force;(ii)  the three &quot;G&quot; boats should be regarded as available for the North Atlantic service;(iii) All preparations should, however, be made toenable the &quot;G&quot; boats to be used by theRoyal Air Force at short notice ifnecessary.,3. The state of preparedness of the &quot;G&quot; boats hasbeen further examined and it appears that none of thethree has yet obtained a certificate of airworthiness,passed acceptance trials or undergone operational trials.I am advised that there is no prospect of these boats&quot;being ready for a passenger-carrying service this year before the alighting terminals in North America becomefrozen over.4. I have therefore had to consider whether Cabot and-1-

Caribou should be released for the North Atlantic work.I have reached the conclusion that, having regard to our recent losses in Royal Air Force flying boats and to theincreased need for long-range reconnaissances over sea asa result of recent developments,  these two boats should remain with the Royal Air Force for the time being.5. As regards the &quot;G&quot; boats, I feel that the change inthe military situation requires that these boats should now be handed over for use by the Royal Air Force with instructions that they are to be adapted for Service use as speedily as possible.,6. The result of all this must be, I am afraid, to rule out the possibility of resuming the Atlantic service this year and in all probability we shall have to abandonit until after the warQ I propose to keep the situation under close review and if it became possible at any timeto restore any or all of these boats to civil employment,I should certainly do so.7. I am most reluctant to make this recommendation tothe Cabinet, but I do not see how it can be avoided inview of the urgent demands of the war.(Initialled)      S.H.Air Ministry.
