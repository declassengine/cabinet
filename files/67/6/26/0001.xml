C t 130THIS DOCUMENT IS-THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S government secret .P. (G) (40) 126Copy No..May 9th, 1940.   -&quot;&quot;       &apos; WAR   CABINETSURVEY OF EMPLOYMENTNote by the Minister of Supply on Paper No. W.P. (G) (40)1181. The seriousness of the small increase of 11.1$ in employment in theengineering, motor and aircraft industry referred to in W.P.(G)(40)118 lies inits implication for the future and cannot be exaggerated.     This increase is a balance after the loss of men to the forces which will be less, though stillserious, as the Schedule of Reserved Occupations is wider for later age groups.But the gross intake in these industries is only of the order of 20$ in ten months.2. The   Survey covers the principal field of armament employment and itmight have been expected that this group of industries should have been ableto attract, with comparative ease, a substantial increment of metal workers from Outside the whole group of metal industries.      Such workers outside theindustry are 20$ of the total number of metal workers.3. -^he Ministry of Labour do not state what increase there has been in/the number of skilled workers but there is clear evidence of a present shortasof skilled labour and it is alarming -chat immediate skilled labour supplies   Jhave already been nearly exhausted by a total labour intake of 2$ per month   &apos;which is only twice the rate of intake in 1 93&amp; and 1937-4. The increase in armament production has of course been well inexcess of 11$ and it is clear that there has been a considerable transference of labour within this group on to armament work.      As a rough estimate, atleast 40$ of the output of these industries is for the Ministry of Supply alone and there is a clear limit to further internal transference since Air Ministryemployment is increasing and export trade must be maintained.5. There must be a rapid acceleration in the intake into the engineering industries, there will othervri.se be severe repercussions on the production ofarmaments which it is hoped to achieve by the end of the second year of war.Of necessity in such plans it has been assumed that additional labour will beavailable as it is required.     The position will rapidly become more serious.New machine tools which are now coming into production on a single shift will soonhave to be working on two and three shifts.      In the manufacture of shellcomponents alone an increase of nearly ten times the present rate is being planned which will mean an additional direct employment of some 250,000.Tank output is planned to increase to four times the present rate by Z 4- 24with further increases later.     The engineering group is not the only onewhich will increase, explosive production will increase to five times the present rate by the end of the second year of war.     Seven filling factories will operate in addition to the present three.6. This expanding programme depends upon labour (both skilled andunskilled) being available on a considerably increased scale to man new factories and new plant as they are ready for production.(initialled)      E.
