C u     i1. At the request of the Home Defence Executive, theMinistry of Home Security is working out plans for theevacuation on threat of invasion of a substantial proportionof the population of the coast towns in East Anglia and Kent.The towns affected are -Great YarmouthLowestoftHarwichAldeburghSouthwoldFelixstoweClactonFrinton and WaltonSouthendMargate (including Westgate andBirchington)BroadstairsRamsgateMinsterSandwichDealDoverFolkestoneSandgateHythe.2. The object of the evacuation is primarily military.It is to secure that the movement of troops in repelling the invasion is not impeded by   crowds of refugees on the roads.Recent experience in the Low Countries and France has shownhow seriously military movements may be hampered in this way.)The evacuation would&apos; of course also serve the substantialadvantage of saving life among the civilian population andwould canalise the inevitable rush of people from pointsthreatened by invasion.5. Something has already been done to reduce thepopulation in these areas.    Evacuated children have been removed and a proportion of the native children (37*000 outof   a total of 75*000) have been taken away under a voluntary5 ECRET.

- 2 -scheme of evacuation.    There is also a fairly substantialvoluntary exodus, at any rate from the Kent coast towns.It may be practicable to make   arrangements for some other special categories   of persons to be removed before the threat becomes Imminent.    Nevertheless, it remains truethat a very large proportion of the population must beexpected to be still in these towns at a time when an invasion threat becomes imminent, and their presenceconstitutes a serious military problem.4. The plans which are being formulated provide forthe transport by rail at the Government expense to reception areas in the outskirts of London and in the Midlands ofabout 60 per cent of the present population.   No evacuation by road would be permitted once the emergency arose.   Thescheme is being prepared   on the basis that it might have   tobe put into operation at from 12 to 24 hours&apos; notice and thatthe evacuation itself should be completed within 48 hoursfrom the departure of the first train.   The plan must therefore be put into operation at least two to three days before the emergency develops.5.        In the case of an industrial town such as GreatYarmouth, which contains some factories engaged on importantwar work, it would be undesirable that essential workers should   leave with the rest of the population.   The invasionmight never materialise or be repelled;   and meantime seriousinterruption of production would have taken place.   If thisis accepted, it is necessary to work out what proportion ofthe remainder of the civil population in Yarmouth ought toremain in order to keep essential industries and essential services going.   Attempts in the past to determine whichworkers in   a community should be regarded as essential have always - been fraught with difficulty, and it will probably benecessary to lay down that all persons in employment in places such as Yarmouth must remain, and that evacuationshould be confined to women not engaged in essential industries, children, and the aged and infirm.6.       In a town such as Margate, which has no essential industries, the right course will probably be to allow allthe inhabitants to go with the exception of certain government employees (such as G.P.O. telephone-and engineering staff),the Local Authority and its servants, police, fire brigade,civil defence services, public utility undertakings and so forth.7- It is contemplated that the Government would specifyfor local guidance certain broad categories - those who shouldstay, and those who should go.    In the case of categoriesscheduled to remain, power should be given to the regional commissioner, in conjunction with the Government departments and Local Authorities concerned, to authorise the departure of   individuals where the national interest is better served by departure than by retention.    The whole of certain categories, e.g. retail distributors and certain professionswould   clearly not be needed for the reduced population, and

the Ministry of Labour might be desirous of removingto other parts of the country workers engaged in certain essential industries.   The same consideration would applyto certain Government Departments.8. The scheme will be compulsory, both as regardsthose who should go and those who. should stay;    but in enforcing a compulsory scheme grave difficulties arise.    Itis proposed that, while the scheme must be compulsory inform, discretion should be exercised in its application,e.g. a wife might be allowed to remain with her husbandbut that the evacuation of children should be enforced.9. The scheme   has been discussed confidentially withthe other Government Departments concerned and with thePolice and Local Authorities.    Local Authorities who wouldbe responsible for receiving and providing billets for the refugees have been told to get ahead with their preparations,even if they involve some public disclosure of the factthat provision is being made for another wave of evacuees.The reception authorities have not, however, in any case been told that the refugees whom they have to receive are coming from the East Coast towns.    The authorities on the east coast have been placed under a more stringent ban ofsecrecj&apos;&quot;, although Chief Constables have been authorised toreveal the plan so far as is necessary to the subordinateranks in their forces.10.       The maintenance of a ban on the public disclosure of plans at the evacuation end will severely hamper theDepartment in working out its arrangements(i)      To identify the persons who should go and thosewho   should stay is virtually impossible, unlesspublic disclosure is allowed.   With fulldisclosure the whole position can be thrashedout locally.(ii)      If there is no public indication before theevent of the identity of those who should stay,it will be extremely difficult to bring thescheme into operation in an orderly fashion inthe few hours that would remain beforeevacuation commences.(iii)     If the plan   remains confidential and membersof the public do not know what is expected of them,they have no opportunity for making private arrangements of one kind or another in anticipation of evacuation.    These private arrangements will make the movement less abruptand   increase greatly the orderly nature of themovement.    Similar considerations apply to banksand other Institutions which will have to do agood deal cx  preliminary planning if evacuationis not to result in complete chaos in their arrangements.

11.       Objections to the disclosure of plans based on theground of increased apprehension and disquiet have nowvirtually disappeared, as the country has been toldby Ministers and through Sir Hugh Ellesf broadcast thatinvasion is a contingency against which the country mustprepare.12.       Authority is accordingly sought for publicdisclosure of t^je general   character and scope of the plans for the evacuation of the East Coast townsreferred to in paragraph 1.J.
