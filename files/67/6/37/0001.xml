SECRET IJWAR CABINET Copy No. IW.P.(G)(40) 157.23rd May 1940. INDIAProposal by the Government ox India to raise addition;troops.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate the attached telegram dated the 18thMay No.1046 from the Government of India.   Although the telegram arises out of correspondence that has taken placeon the question of suoport for Afghanistan against possibleSoviet aggression, it will be seen that the additional units which the Government of India now propose to raise, or atany rate a substantial part of them, might be available for operations - in other theatres and that the Government ofIndia have themselves had this in mind.Briefly, the Government of India propose to provideforces amounting in terms of Infantry to some 6 divisions for the primary purpose of dealing with Soviet aggression,though some part of them would be available for otherourposes as just indicated if the Soviet menace remainedQuiescent.   They propose to raise the additional troops(estimated as regards Infantry at 18 battalions) required to supplement their existing forces to provide the necessarytotal.   They are prepared to bear the initial cost of raising these troops and of equipping them so far as this canbe done from their own resources.   They are further preparedto bear the recurring cost of maintaining them on the under-standing that if any portion of these forces are called upon for service overseas they would become a liability of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.   In the latter case the completion oftheir equipment to the higher External Defence Troops scalewould also be the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin accordance with the existing policy.Thus, it will be seen that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould give the Government of India the confirmation forwhich they ask to go ahead with the raising of the units,Headquarters, etc., mentioned in paragraph 3 of theGovernment of India&apos;s telegram, without assuming any freshliability other than that for some equipment, the release ofwhich would rest with the Priority Committee here.   It willbe noted, however, from paragraphs 5(e) and 9 of the telegramthat the question of dollar exchange arises; and on this Iam separately approaching the Treasury.I request sanction to inform the Government of india that their action in starting to raise the troops mentionedin paragraph 3 is approved and, subject to Treasury concurr-ence, to authorise them to proceed with the purchase of thenecessary Mechanical Transport.   This, I feel assured, willbe a valuable step forward towards enabling India to pull herweight yet more fully in the present struggle.INDIA OFFICE,,L.S.A.
TELEGRAM from the Government of India, Defence Department,to the Secretary of State for India, dated18th May 1940.1046This telegram has reference to sub-paragraph (c) ofparagraph No.6 of our telegram No.1016, May 15th, 1940.   Wethere stated that given certain assistance from His MajestyfeGovernment we might be able to prepare.in India the land forces required: we wish to implement our plans for firstphase of support to Afghanistan and other forces referred toin sub-paragraph (a) of same paragraph.2.     After a rapid review of the whole of our resources inmen and equipment and after making due provision for thesecurity of India in these altered circumstances we nowconfirm that on certain conditions we shall be able to raiseand prepare additional forces required by spring of 1941subject to what is stated in paragraph No.7 of my telegramNo.1016.3.     The net additional forces to be raised and prepared are broadly speaking (a) 18 Infantry Battalions, (b) 3 FieldRegiments, (c) Sappers and Miners and Signal units for 6divisions, (d) Force, Divisional, Brigade, and L,of C.Headquarters for whole force, (e) base organisations forwhole force, (f) medical and supply arrangements for wholeforce, (g) formation of 1 mobile brigade (trucked), (h)about100 M.T. sections totalling about 3,000 vehicles with some sort of repair organisation, (i) considerable expansion in schools of all sorts for purpose of training officers andall specialised units as well as special arrangements fortraining large numbers of personnel required for static a.A.artillery defence.4.     The implementing of these measures will absorb ourentire energies for at least a year and would represent ourmaximum and in our opinion most useful and most suitable war effort on military side for whatever purpose (whether for russian menace or for any other object) during that time.5.     Conditions referred to in paragraph 2 above are (a)that an immediate start should be made, (b) that serious administrative delays, which are inseparable from constant-reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government for sanction to individual measures, should be eliminated,, (c) that extensiveresort to improvisation will be made in India in order to makethe maximum.possible use of all our local resources andequipment without running undue risks, (d) that a certainamount, but not a great deal, of armament and technicalequipment should be made available to us by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and (e) that we should be given sufficientdollars to enable us to purchase in America our minimum requirements particularly for M.T.6.     The first of these two may be considered together.   Itwill be evident from our last telegrams on this subject,read in particular with paragraph 4 of this telegram, that measures (namely those described in paragraph 3 above) whichare within our maximum present capacity to prepare in orderto protect India from Russianmenace, and such measures as would represent our maximum military war effort in any case and for whatever purpose are co-extensive and identical.Under terms of recent financial settlement with His Majesty^Government governing incidence of the whole expenditure inIndia, protection of India from Russian menace would beconsidered to be a joint war measure.   Various methods of
apportioning attendant expenditure devised, but in any case we would have been willing to bear an equitable share of it.We feel political India also would be prepared to accept asa reasonable charge on Indian revenues as large a share as she could afford of whatever measures were deemed necessaryto protect her from Russian aggression.   Bearing this in mind and&quot;remembering also that measures proposed in this telegram,although representing India&apos;s maximum war effort for timebeing, do not cover all measures necessary to counteractRussian menace (because for one thing they do not includeair forces nor A.A. defence, and for another all these measures cover only first phase of operations that would beeventually necessary) we have come to the conclusion that wewould be fully justified, and would be supported by indian opinion, in offering to pay for all measures referred to inparagraph 3 above in so far as those measures can be executed by ourselves.   We will revert to this question in alater paragraph, but, for the present, this decisionautomatically fulfils first two of our conditions because,subject to your confirmation, we are now issuing ordersnecessary to implement our proposals in paragraph 3 above,and because financial control over consequent expenditure will be exercised in India under our own powers.   In adoptingthis course we have in mind great pressure under whichImperial departments are now labouring and unfairness of adding to their task and most important fact, even ifRussian menace should not materialise, our efforts will notbe wasted, but will be at disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment for other theatres of war.   This fact should involve nodifficulty with Indian political opinion because, under existing financial plan, His Majesty&apos;s Government will pay for whatever further troops she uses overseas, and also because His Majesty&apos;s Government will presumably not sodenude India of trooos (except in last resort) as to leaveher with no protection at all against Russian menace or toremove underlying justification for charge, namely that expenditure now proposed is being Incurred on India&apos;s own defence.7.     The third condition in paragraph 5 above dominates thewhole programme.   It means of course that the new units to beraised will be necessarily on a low scale of equipment.    it also means that if His Majesty&apos;s Government remove theadditional forces we are now creating for service outsideIndia we shall be left with a permanently weakened army forour own protection because we shall be unable to equip anyreplacements.   We feel however that this risk must be run.it will be only, a temporary risk because in due course as thesupply position at home improves we presume that increasingquantities of equipment can be released for India.8.     We will address you separately in due course concerningour minimum requirements under the fourth condition inparagraph 5 above and can only hope that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will be able to meet us in this matter.9.     The last condition in paragraph 5 is of great importance and unless it is fulfilled our efforts will be largely render-ed nugatory.   As you are aware our supply of M.T. from Englandhas been fixed at 600 chassis per mensem and no furtherproduction can be placed at our disposal at present even forTrout and its replacements owing to shortage of raw materials.It seems to us essential that the American market for M.T.should be now opened to us both for vehicles for Trout andalso for the additional 100 M.T. sections which our present proposals require.   It is impossible as yet to give any firmoutside estimate of amount of dollars we should need but this
will be furnished to you in due course.   For present purposesa minimum of 7 and a maximum of 10 million dollars may betaken.   We request authority to place orders on Indianimporters for M.T. chassis up to this amount.10.     To revert to the financial aspect of these proposalswhich we left in paragraph 6 above,   proposals in my telegrami1016, May 15th, may be classified for purposes of this para-graph as follows: (a) provision of 14 additional squadrons ofair force, (b) provision of 3 mobile a.A. artillery regimentscomplete, (c) provision of pieces for static a.a. which is designed to protect military objectives and L.of C. withinIndia, (d) provision of a certain amount of technical equip-ment from home, (e) the rest of the proposals including the raising, training and improvised equipping of additional land forces and ancillary services and raising of 100 M.T.sections.   Our own estimates (which should be treated withthe greatest reserve) of rough cost of these items at pre-war prices are - for item (a) 10 , half of 21, crores ofrupees capital and 6 or 7, half of 12 or 14, crores rupeesrecurring including 100% reserves and peace wastage only.For item (b) we cannot estimate.   For item (c) 6, half of12, crores rupees, capital and about half-a-crore of rupees,half of one, recurring.   For item (d) we can frame no estimate.   For item (e) 13, half of 26, crores of rupeescapital and 12i, half of 25, crores recurring in a full year.We are offering to pay for the last of these items and consider that whatever previous views have been expressed asto best or most logical method of apportioning cost ofRussian menace between the two Governments, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might reasonably agree to provide the remainingforces and equipments in items (a) to (d) at their expense.The division of cost would thus be on a (? required)administrative basis, which method of division, although notessentially logical, would be highly convenient and efficientfrom a practical point of view.   Should any of the forces initem (e) be taken for overseas theatres, then, under existingplan, incidence of their cost would of course fall on british Exchequer.    It has been explained in paragraph above that implementing of measures in item (e) will represent India&apos;s maximum war effort for some time to come.Similarly, the payment for these measures represents as great a financial effort as we can make without resorting to borr-owing on a scale which might precipitate serious politicalreactions.11.     You will recognise that we shall have to justify this expenditure before Indian opinion as representing an equitable-able share of immediate measures necessary to safeguard india from Russian aggression.   We do not anticipate any insuperable-able difficulties in doing so.   We ourselves feel, and wehave no doubt that a large element in the country would agree,that this expenditure has a further justification, namely,that India should put forth her immediate maximum militaryand financial effort in common cause. Nevertheless, theRussianmenace and Indian apprehensions regarding it, seem tous to provide a most favourable opportunity for initiatingthese efforts with minimum political opposition.12.     In addition to the measures described in paragraph above initiating the scheme, train at our cost, personnel for a further 2 Indian air force squadrons.    It is hoped thatpersonnel will be fully trained within 18 months.   Thepolitical popularity of;.such measure will be great and itwill, we hope, be of general assistance in due course.
