S E ORE To17TH l&amp;Y,  1940. COPY NO.WAR CABINEToINVASION OP GREAT britain    POSSIBLE CO-OPERATION&apos;BY A &quot;FIFTH COLUMN&quot; memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary0lo At the Meeting of the War Cabinet on the 15th May,reference was made to the possibility that there might be&quot;Fifth Column&apos; elements In this country who might co-operate with the enemy in the event of any airborne or seaborneinvasion of these Islandsc     The Prime Minister invited theLord Privy Seal and the Minister without Portfolio to collaborate with me in considering, in the light ofrecent experience in Holland, whether any furtherprecautions should be taken in respect of enemy aliens orother groups of persons in this country who might beconsidered likely to co-operate with enemy invaders in theevent of an invasion (W*M.(40) 123rd Conclusions, Minute 15).The Lord Privy Seal and the Minister without Portfolxer-have reviewed the whole problem,  in consultation with me,and at their request I am submitting, for consideration bythe War Cabinet, the following statement of th^--conclusions which we have reached;,     I have their authority to saythat they concur in the terms of this memorandum.20 I have taken steps to obtain such information as Ican about the nature of the assistance given to the Germaninvaders of Holland by persons previously established inthat countryD      I have discussed this matter with sir nevile Blsnd;    and I have also had the advantage of a longinterview with the Dutch Minister of Justice, a civilianofficial of that Ministry and two Dutch military officers.Vtfhile it is clear that the German troops arriving in .   ,Holland, whether by parachute or by troop-carrying aircraftreceived invaluable assistance from persons resident in thecountry, my Dutch informants were very emphatic that forthe most part this help was given, in accordance with a pre- -arranged scheme, by Nazi Germans resident in Holland.    The,,had no evidence that such&apos; assistance had been given by thS -refugee element in the German resident population, and they&apos;SSlSn that gonroarativoly^liUle help had been given^at, any rateuntil a late stage,  oy Dutchmen who were members of the N.SVB.(the Dutyh Fascist Party):,In these circumstances I think it is important to bearin mind the difference between conditions in Holland andconditions in this country     In Holland, there had been an

open frontier with Germany and up to the very moment ofthe invasion free communication between the two countriesin accordance with a Treaty which gave the Germansa right of free access to Dutch territory.      In our case-there has for the last twenty-five years &quot;been astrict control over the entry of all aliens, and duringthe last nine months there has been no intercoursewhatsoever between Germany and this countryi,     in holland there were 100,000 German residents, many of whom were strong supporters of the Nazi cause and members, nodoubt, of the Nazi Party0     In this country the NaziParty organisation was broken up at the outbreak of war,and those members of it who had not already returned toGermany were immediately internedo     There are about73,000 Germans and Austrians In this country, but thegreat bulk of these are refugees from Nazi oppressionwho are bitterly opposed to the German regime in Germany.They have been carefully examined by tribunals speciallyappointed for the purpose, and  as a result of this examination about 600&apos;  were ordered to be internede    Theremainder were divided into two classes -   (a)    Category B;those about whom the tribunals felt some doubt and decided that, while they need not be interned they shouldcomply with the certain special restrictions imposed on enemy aliens by the new Aliens Order;    and (b) Category C;those as to whom the tribunals were satisfied that theywere wholly friendly to this country and could safely beallowed to remain at liberty subject only to therestrictions applicable to neutral aliens,,     There are about 64,000 men and women in this Category C.30 In considering&apos; the possibility of &quot;Fifth Column&quot;action in this o^notftery, we have renewed the disposition of a number of different groups which might be suspected of subversive activities;    and I propose in thismemorandum to deal briefly with each of these groups.40 Germans and Atstrians0     Widespread investigationsby the Intelligence Service have not revealed any evidenceof any plan for obtaining, in the event of invasion,assistance from Germans and Austrians in this country:but it has been thought expedient, as an additionalmeasure of precaution, to take the following action with a view to disorganising any such plan which mightexist:-(a)    I have already interned all male germans and Austrians between the ages of 16 and 6\)who were resident in the Counties onthe East and &quot;South-East coast fromNairn to Hampshire;     iBe0 in a zonemarked out by the Military authorities as an area of possible militaryoperations 0

(b)    I have also interned all maleGermans and Austrians between the ages of 16 and 60 who had heenplaced by the local tribunalsin Category B in whatever partof the country they were residing.(These had previously been exempt from internment but liable to thespecial restrictions applicable toenenry aliens) 0If there was any pre-arranged plan by which invaderswere to be helped by Germans resident in thiscountry, such a plan will have been disorganisedcompletely by the measures already taken,,To those Germans and Austrians who havealready been interned there will be added from day to day under the existing procedure any men orwomen whose conduct gives ground for suspicion.5, If, in addition to the measures already taken, wholesale measures of internment were adopted as regards those who have been put in the C Category ,(iee0 exempted both from internment and from thespecial restrictions) these would have to bebased on the principle that all Germans and Austrians,including women, are potentially dangerous,regardless of the classifications in which these people have been put after examination by the tribunals and Regional Advisory CommitteesQ     Thereare very strong and obvious objections to wholesalemeasures of internment0     In the present stateof public opinion wholesale measures would beaccepted and indeed welcomed in many quarters, butit is almost inevitable that in a short spaceof time there would be a sharp redaction ofopinion,.     If thousands of women, includingpregnant women and women with young children,were subjected to the conditions of barrack-roomlife in some sort   of internment carnp, there would soon be a public outcry against this treatmentof persons of whom the great majority are refugees and most are individually known to British subjectswho are convinced of their friendliness0     Theloss to the war effort? by   the internment of many thousands of people who are rendering usefulservice in various capacities, would also be great,6* If further measures of internment are to betaken, the next step would be to intern the 3,000German and Austrian women who have been placed   in category B by the Tribunals, i-0&apos; exempted from internment but not from the special restrictions.

7*        Italians. There are about 19y000 Italians inthis country&quot;; of whom 7 ,-.700 are women and 11,300 are men.About 1,200 of the male Italians are known to be members of the Italian Fascist Partyc   Lists of all these people have been prepared and issued to the police, andshould war break out with Italy instructions would be givenfor their immediate internments     At the same time about300 persons would be interned who? though possessingBritish nationality? have also Italian nationality or areof Italian origin^ and are known to be members of the ItalianFascist PartynAs regards the remaining Italians, it is proposed inthe event of war to intern the males between the ages of i6and60 who have been resident for less than ten years in thiscountryoIn addition,    all Italians,; both men and women, will inthe event of war become enemy aliens and will be subjected to the special restrictions in the Aliens Order which limit the movements of persons from their registered address, andprohibit the possession of cameras, motor cars, etc except with the special permission of the police.8.      Czech Refugee So     Among the refugees who came from czechoslovakia are some possessing German nationality.These are being treated like other Germans.    Those who areNationals of the former state of Czechoslovakia are notenemy aliens, but Nationals of a friendly country.    Some ofthem have joined the Czech Legion;    many others are anxiousto help the Allies, and in recent months employment has beenfound for many of them, particularly on the lando9.       There are among the Czech refugees Communists who,like the British Communists, are opposed to the war, butthere is no information to suggest that these persons wouldbe likely to assist the enemyo      The Czechs are divided intonumerous political groups.      Some of these groups areviolently hostile to other groups and members of each group are prone to denounce their political opponentso      Caretherefore must be taken before accepting many of the allegations made by Czechs about other Czechs.The present policy is to intern (under the newprovision in the Aliens Order which gives the Home Secretarypower to detain persons who would, but for the war, be liableto deportation) any Czechs who are unreliable or of questionablecharacter or who engage in undesirable political activities.10*       British Fascistso       Although the policy of theBritish Union of Fascists is to oppose the war and to condemnthe Government, there is no evidence that they would be likelyto assist the enemy.    Their public propaganda strikes   apatriotic note.   Nevertheless;- lists have been prepared ofthe leading people in the organisation, in case at any timeinformation should be available suggesting that theorganisation is likely to be used either to assist the enemy or to impede the war effort of this country in such a manner that it is necessary to suppress its activities entirely.Before such persons could be detained there would have to beinformation in each case to satisfy the Home Secretary under regulation 18B of the Defence Regulations that there is reasonable cause to believe that the individual was of hostileorigin or associations or that he had recently been concernedin acts prejudicial to the public safety or the defence ofthe realrn^ or in the instigation of such acts.

In my view it would be a mistake to strike atthis organisation at this stage by way of interning theleaders.     Apart from the fact that there is no evidence on which such action could be justified? it is to beborne in mind that premature action would leave theorganisation itself in being and other leaders could beappointed to take the place of those who had beenapprehended.    In my view we should hold our hand for themoment, .but. if at any time we have good reason to believethat the BoUeFo are on the point of taking action insupport of the enemy, we should then intern forth with the leaders whom we have previously marked downo    Swiftaction taken then would have the effect of paralysingthe organisation at the appropriate moment011.      CommunistSo     While the Communist Party are opposing the war, in pursuance of the policy of the Comintern,there is no indication at present that they have beengiven instructions to take action that would be likelyto assist a Nazi victoryc    Their line is that the workersin German, Prance and the United Kingdom, ought to oppose the &quot;Capitalist&quot; Governments of these countries with aview to bringing to an end a war between &quot;the rival robberbandits of Britain, Prance and Germany&quot;oLists have been prepared of the leading individuals in the Communist, party and in the local branches of theParty,  in case at any time it should become desirable totake drastic action;    but the information available abouteach of these individuals is not of such a character asto justify their internment under Regulation 18B of theDefence Regulations on the ground that they &quot;have been concerned in acts prejudicial to the public safety orthe defence of the realm&quot;.12.-    The immediate danger from the Communists arises,not from any desire on their part to help the Nazis, but from their policy of provoking and fostering industrialdiscontents    We have examined this aspect of the problem in consultation with the Minister of Labour, and we are strongly of opinion that;  save in quite exceptional cases,it would be inexpedient to seek to apply penal sanctions against shop-stewards or others who are suspected of having fostered industrial disputes for ulterior motives.In most cases of this kind the dispute arises fromgrievances which, though they may have been magnified,are none the less real;    and action taken against thestop-steward or other person would be likely to arouseconsiderable ill-feeling among the workers.    We think itpreferable that an attempt should be made to deal with difficulties of this kind through existing labour machinery;and the Minister of Labour has suggested that he shouldbe given full information of any such cases which mayoome to notice in order that he may take such action asis open to him to bring about an improvement in conditionsin the particular industry or factory concerned.13.      I*RoA*-     The work of the police in breaking up theI.R.A.  organisation has been very successful..    About 100persons have been convicted and most of them sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.      In addition     167 personshave been expelled from Great Britain.      There have been

no outrages since the 16th March, 1940, and recent information shows that those members left in the country have difficulty in making contact with leaders in Eireand are without instruction in the making of explosives0The possibility of further sporadic trouble cannot be ignored, but the organisation cannot now be regarded as aserious menace..14.     Eireo       Although it falls outside the scope ofthis memorandum we think it right to refer to thepossibility of &quot;Fifth Column&quot; activities in Eire.      Thenumber of enemy aliens now proceeding to Eire from thiscountry is neglibible;    but we have heard unconfirmedreports that Germans are finding their way there by seathrough ports on the West Coast of Ireland.It might well be easier for the enemy to arrangef or &apos;3?if th Column&quot; co-operation in Eire in the event ofhis intending to establish a footing there and we suggestthat the Departments concerned might be invited toconsider as a matter of urgency whether any further measures should be taken to ascertain whether-germans are in fact penetrating into Eire by the direct sea routes and to prevent the possible formation of a&quot;Fifth Column&quot;in that country.(Intld)    J.A.
