The general results of the first two days of thecheck, which was applied to 2G?^of the letters passingfrom Great Britain to Northern Ireland and Eire, indicatethat some 150 letters contained fairly importantindiscretions on such subjects as the position of aerodromes,  anti-aircraft defences, the position of units,arrangements by Irish soldiers to desert, the presenceof I.R.A.  or German sympathisers in this country, and-theevacuation of a Government Department.3.
