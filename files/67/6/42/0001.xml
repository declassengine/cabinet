(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; SGOVERNMENT)SECRET 1m-CA31MSTW.P.(G)(40) 142 _ Copy No.   /,\INDIA29th May 1940.Revolutionary Movements OrdinanceMemorandum by the Secretary of State Tor india the Cabinet on 27th October 1937 approved in principle the draft of an enactment called the Revolutionary MovementsOrdinance to provide the authorities in india with powers,for dealing with revolutionary movements, which had beenfound useful in previous Civil uisobedience campaigns inmoia or were suggested by experience elsewhere.   Thisapr.rovaI was not given in relation to any actual oranticipated menace at tnetime but as a precaution against adossi*oIe emergency; and it was arranged that, if the&quot;occasion arose, the matter should, be referred again to theCabinet (if in session) before the Ordinance was enacted.The Viceroy has now asked for the contingent approvalof the Cabinet for the issue of the Ordinance if ana whenthe occasion arose, without the necessity of having to refeto the Cabinet when the time came.   His object is to avoid any delay that might inevitably occur if the Cabinet wereotherwise ore-occupied at a time when an emergency arose inIndia requiring the immediate enactment of the Ordinance.The Viceroy has to be prepared for the possibility of revolutionary movements arising from a variety of causes -not only a Civil Disobedience campaign which, though it maybe suspended, is still the avowed&quot;policy of Congress - buralso from the possible activities of other bodies such asthe ex-terrorists or the Khaksars - a body of Muslim ext-rem-ists who have recently given trouble leading to violence -or from the ever-present menace of communal trouble.   More-over, though, if the Congress launch a Civil Disobediencecampaign, Mr. Gandhi would doubtless attempt to give it anon-violent character, its existence would neverthelessencourage violent and revolutionary movements, prompted by others, by creating conditions favourable to their success.We have also to consider that violent elements may takeadvantage of any deterioration in the military situation to disturb the public peace and to interfere with india&apos;s war effort.I hope that it may yet prove unnecessary to use theRevolutionary Movements Ordinance, but I am convinced thatthe Viceroy is right in desiring that in&apos; presentcircumstances all the emergency powers which have beenprepared should be available for&quot; use, if necessary, withoutany avoidable delay.    I would therefore suggest that ishould be given authority, without further reference to zheCaoinet, to permit the Viceroy to enact this Ordinance in any emergency in which he and I are satisfied that the necessityior it has arisen.MDIA OFFICE.D.
