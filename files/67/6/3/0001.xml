Summary of Conclusions39
THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES TO THE ALLIES ANDTO GERMANY RESPECTIVELY OF THE SEIZURE BYGERMANY OF DENMARK AND NORWAY.I. INTRODUCTORY.AT their meeting held on the 10th April, 1940 (E.P. (M.) (40) 10th Conclu-sions, Minute 6 (a) ), the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy agreed : To invite Lord Stamp&apos;s Survey of Economic and Financial Plans toprepare a concise preliminary statement setting out the economic consequences to the Allies and to Germany respectively of the seizure by Germany of denmark and Norway.The Committee further asked that this statement should be prepared in time toenable the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the Lord privy seal, to circulate it to the War Cabinet not later than Saturday, the 13th April,1940.2. In the time at our disposal, we have only been able to deal in a roughand ready manner with many important aspects of the problem referred to us;and we should be glad to submit a more considered report on these questions ata later date. It would have been quite impossible in this short time to have completed our task without the close co-operation that we have received, fromall the Departments concerned, at every stage of the preparation of the presentdocument.3. At the meeting of the Ministerial Committee, it was agreed that for thetime being at least it must be assumed that not only Norway but also Sweden,Finland, and the three Baltic States are now cut off from the outer world; andthat in consequence both their import and export trade must be regarded as having been brought under German domination. It was recognised that it maybe possible for these countries to maintain a limited export trade through Narvik(when freed from German occupation) and perhaps through Petsamo.* But in preparing the present appreciation, we have proceeded on the assumptionthat the Allied Navies will treat seaborne imports to, and exports from, the scandinavian and the Baltic States in precisely the same manner as they wouldimports to, or exports from, Germany.4. It has been necessary also for us to make certain other assumptions. Ofthese, the following are the more important : (a) that the Allied Governments will exercise their right of angary in respectof all ships flying the flags of the Scandinavian and Baltic states which they can seize;(b) that the Germans will control the economy of Denmark and Norway (andof Sweden and Finland and the Baltic States as and. when they mayseize them) exclusively in their own interests and with utter disregardto the welfare of the inhabitants of these countries.II. ECONOMIC  CONSEQUENCES  TO  THE  ALLIES.(a) Imports.(i) Raw Materials and Manufactured Goods.5. Our imports from Sweden, Norway and Finland consisted largely of rawTmaterials, other than food, whilst our imports from Denmark were mainly foodproducts. For the year 1938, of our total imports of raw materials and manu-factured goods, 4-47 per cent, were from Sweden, 1-90 per cent, from Norway,* We may also continue to obtain small quantities of flax from the Baltic States byway of Odessa.[21128]
0 - 36 per cent, from Denmark and 3 - 70 per cent, from Finland. Sweden suppliedus with large quantities of iron ore, timber and wood pulp, paper and paper-board, and highly specialised types of iron and steel manufactures and machinery.Norway supplied iron-ore, aluminium, nickel, paper and paper-board and calcium carbide in significant quantities; and Finland paper and paper-making materials and timber. Since September last our imports of timber from the scandinavian countries have been reduced to small proportions.6. The commodities where we are likely to encounter difficulties as the resultof the loss of the Scandinavian supplies, in the order of their importance inrelation to our war effort, as assessed by the Ministry of Supply, are : (i) timber,(ii) iron-ore, (iii) special steels and ferro-alloys, (iv) aluminium, (v) wood pulp,(vi) paper, (vii) calcium carbide, and (viii) a group of much less importance,including arsenic, french chalk, graphite and hides and calf skins.7. Some of the consequences of the restriction of supply of the more vitalof these commodities may be briefly indicated : Timber.In 1938 about 41 per cent, of our imports of softwoods came from norway, Sweden, and Finland. Recent^ yepepfeg have been only about one-quarter of average pre-war imports. At the time of the invasion, our programme included purchases amounting to some 100,000 standards fromScandinavian sources, and representing about 10 per cent, of our imports as now planned. The loss of these imports will further complicate an alreadygrave deficiency in this important raw material. Comparable losses arelikely to be sustained in the case of plywood and pit props.Iron-ore.In the first year of the war, our import programme for iron ore fromthe Scandinavian countries amounted to If million tons, about one-quarterof our total ore import programme. It will now be necessary to bring this quantity of ore from more distant sources, for example, from Brazil andfrom West and North African ports. This will raise shipping difficultiesbecause of the increase in the length of haul, which will be accentuated bythe fact that much of the ore will require to be brought to North-East coast ports. Swedish ore has lately been reserved for use exclusively in our steelfurnaces (as a reducing agent), and stocks amount to over three months&apos;requirements. In course of time, it may be possible to adapt our own steelfurnaces so as to facilitate the replacement of Swedish by ordinary Britishores; in the meantime, Brazilian ores would provide a satisfactory, and African ores a fairly satisfactory, substitute for the special uses to whichSwedish ore is now devoted. While there is no reason for undue alarm overthe ore situation, it will be necessary to make immediate provision forincreased imports from alternative sources of supply.Special Steels and Ferro-Alloys.Scandinavia is a very large producer of ferro-alloys and special steels,and has a considerable export surplus, much of which we had expected topurchase. Five-sixths of our imports of ferro-alloys were due to come fromthis source (chiefly from Southern Norway), and practically all of our importsof special steels (from Sweden). The difficulty in this case is one of foreign exchange rather than shipping; for the total tonnage involved is comparatively small (about 75,000 tons per annum), and there are abundant supplies in theUnited States and in Canada. The ferro-alloys might also be bought in some european countries such as Yugoslavia, but purchases of special steels canonly be made in North America. Stocks of the ferro-alloys are in all thecases affected above four months&apos; requirements. Special steels are alreadylimited in supply, and imports from Sweden would have gone into ratherspecialised uses notably the manufacture of ball-bearings.
Aluminium.Norway would normally have provided us, in the first year of war, withsome 10,000 tons of aluminium, equal to 14 per cent, of our total projectedimports or 10 per cent, of our total planned supplies. The imports from norway will not be easy to replace, since it might be difficult to securefurther rapid acceleration of production in Great Britain and Canada. Atpresent stocks of aluminium are little, if at all, greater than at the outbreakof war, but should serve to carry us over a short period of readjustment.Prompt action to make good the deficiency is particularly necessary in viewof the special importance of aluminium to our war effort and of the rapid increase in requirements implied in the present programme.Wood pulp.About one-half of our wood pulp for industrial purposes comes fromthe Scandinavian countries, the chief alternative sources of supply beingCanada and the United States. The disappearance of Scandinavian supplies would cause a large diminution in the supply of raw materials for the artificial silk industry. Practically the whole of the supply of wood pulpfor paper-making is obtained from the Scandinavian States.Paper.Sweden, Norway and Finland were due to supply us in the first year of war with about half of our imports of paper (other than newsprint). Itwill be difficult to obtain paper from other sources, the alternatives being theNetherlands and North America, and any increase in the import of paper-making materials in order to meet the deficiency would throw a heavy burden on our shipping facilities. The cutting off of these supplies provides a suitable opportunity for the reconsideration of our whole policy with regardto paper imports and paper consumption.Calcium Carbide.Over three-quarters of our imports of calcium carbide, an extremely important raw material for certain industrial processes, such as oxy-acetylenewelding, come from Norway. The main works is at Odda in the neighbour-hood of Bergen. The deficiency can probably be made good from Canada,where there is a surplus capacity, or to a lesser extent from Yugoslavia.The cost of supplies to replace those of Norway, if taken wholly from canada, would amount to $750,000. At present there are 5 to 6 months&apos;stocks of calcium carbide in the United Kingdom.8. In addition to these major commodities, the Scandinavian States provideus with a significant proportion of a number of strategic war materials, the total consumption of which may not be large, but any shortage in which might wellconstitute a serious bottleneck in production. The major part of the ball-bearings and roller-bearings imported into the United Kingdom were purchases from Sweden, although imports constituted only about one-tenth of home produc-tion. Finally, SAveden supplied relatively small quantities of very high qualitymachinery products, such as gauges and electric motors.(ii) Food.9. For the first year of the war food imports into the United Kingdom from denmark were expected to reach  34 millions, from Norway  4 - 3 millions, andfrom Sweden about  2-2 millions. The total of  40-5 millions represented9 per cent, of our total programme of food purchases abroad. The maincommodities were bacon, butter, eggs and fish. Of the present consumption ofbacon amounting to 8,500 tons per week, about 2,500 tons would have come from denmark; but there is at present in this country a stock of 29,000 tons. when this is somewhat reduced, probably at the end of this month, no great hardshipwill be involved in a return to the original ration of 4 oz. per week. The position with regard to butter is similar. Against an average weekly consumption of ,500 tons, we were expecting imports of some 1,500 tons per week from Denmark
during the next three months. There is a total stock of 80,000 tons of butter inthe country, and this could with advantage be reduced to 50,000 tons, after whichthe ration could revert from 8 oz. to 4 oz. per week. Imports of eggs from denmark amount at present to about 17 per cent, of our total consumption, andfrom Scandinavian and Baltic countries taken together to about 23 per cent. Wecan temporarily replace some small part of this loss from the Netherlands and elsewhere, but there is almost certain to be a serious shortage of eggs in theautumn. Fish imports from Norway provide us with about 5^ per cent., and from denmark with.about If per cent., of our total supplies; they are likely to bedifficult to replace. It is not likely that any of the present season&apos;s catch ofwhale oil by the Norwegian fleet will be lost to us. Moreover, our existing stocksamount to about 18 months&apos; consumption.(b) Exports.10. Our total exports to the Scandinavian and Baltic countries during thefirst six months of the war amounted to  22-5 millions, about 11 per cent, ofall exports. The most important exports have been coal, coke, and manufacturedfuel, amounting to  6-6 millions, and textiles, amounting to  6-2 millions.About 27 per cent, of our coal exports, 67 per cent, of our coke exports, 13 percent, of our cotton exports, and 17 per cent, of our woollen exports were sent tothese countries. The repercussions of the loss of these markets on our producingindustries, while inconvenient in some cases, are not likely to be permanentlyinjurious. The coal and coke sent to the Scandinavian market was derived mainly from the Northumberland and Durham coalfields. The export, like the domestic,demands for coal and coke have in recent weeks exceeded the supply; Frenchindustries are in urgent need of added quantities, and supplies from thesecoalfields would be suitable for their needs. In the case of the cotton exports, -the Board of Trade anticipates some difficulty in disposing in other areas of the quantities to be released from the Scandinavian markets.(c) Shipping.11. The shipping tonnage of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finlandamounted in 1939 to 8-2 million gross tons; it includes a large tonnage of vesselsbuilt for special trades, such as tankers, refrigerated fruit boats, ships for the ore trade, and the Norwegian whaling fleet. Of the total Norwegian tonnage of4-8 million gross tons, tankers accounted for 2-1 million gross tons. Thetotal tanker tonnage of these countries (2-4 million gross tons) was over 20 percent, of the world total in 1939, and compares with 3-3 million gross tons for britain and the Dominions.12. Under the Shipping Agreement the Norwegians undertook to make available to France and ourselves 144 tankers, having a capacity of 1-62 milliondeadweight tons. The remaining 105 tankers under the Norwegian flag havea capacity of 880,000 deadweight tons. Of the tankers promised to us underthe Agreement 100 had been delivered at the time of the invasion of scandinavia and the remainder had been nominated. In addition, we were at that time onthe point of starting negotiations for the time-chartering of some further 40 or50 tankers, which represented the whole of the remaining free supply of norwegian tankers, since about 30 Norwegian tankers were operating for american charterers under pre-war long-term charters, and another 30 were required for the Scandinavian countries. At the time of the invasion of scandinavia there was already a shortage of tankers in the Allied service; itis obvious, therefore, that if the Allies now fail to secure the full number of norwegian tankers provided for in the Shipping Agreement we shall have difficulty in maintaining our existing stocks of petroleum, let alone improvethem. If it should happen that the amount of Norwegian tankers of which weshall now be able to secure possession were to fall seriously short of that amount,the petroleum position both in this country and in France would quickly becomesuch that both countries would be forced to draw upon their accumulated reserves to an extent which the Mines Department would regard as dangerous.
13. Our original import programme for goods other than petroleum productscontemplated that some 13 million tons, or 28 per cent, of our planned importsfor the first year of the war, would arrive in foreign ships. Some of these imports would come in ships under time-charter to us; but it was always realised that the great bulk of the imports in question would come in ships engaged onvoyages to British ports in the normal course of trade. The proportion of imports which has, in fact, come in ships under the Norwegian flag has, however, been less than the total Norwegian tonnage would have suggested; for a substantialquantity of Norwegian ships have been coming to this country in ballast tofetch coal; and their elimination does not diminish the pool of foreign shipson which we rely for the import of goods. About half a million deadweighttons of Norwegian and Danish tramp shipping is in, or in the neighbourhoodof, ports in the United Kingdom and France; possession of these can be immediately obtained. This, however, represents only a fraction of the totaltramp tonnage under these flags which has hitherto been bringing imports toBritish or French ports. Unless the amount of such tramp tonnage of whichwe obtain possession greatly exceeds this half million tons, we must expect areduction in the number of Norwegian and Danish ships trading to this countryand consequently in the volume of our imports. On the other hand, the factthat through the operation of the blockade the Scandinavian countries will no longer be able to receive imports by sea will release for trade with us andother countries ships of other flags which till now have been trading toScandinavian ports.14. The main repercussions on our shipping position of the german aggression in Scandinavia is to be-found not in the diminution of Scandinaviantonnage trading to this country, but in the necessity imposed upon us of obtainingfrom more distant sources supplies hitherto drawn from Scandinavia. Forexample, iron-ore from Narvik will require to be replaced by iron-ore fromBrazil and Northern and West Africa. The number of voyages that can becompleted annually will be substantially less than those possible on the shortNorth Sea route, even when account is taken of the exceptional delays encounteredon this route in time of war.15. No precise measurement of the factors discussed above is at presentpossible; but on balance we must expect to suffer a substantial loss in our capacity to import, and it is not unlikely that this loss may amount to as muchas 2 million tons per annum or even more.16. There is a further problem that may emerge, if we succeed in obtainingScandinavian tonnage on a considerable scale. There is already a noticeablescarcity of certificated engineers available to man our own ships and some difficulty also in securing deck hands in adequate numbers. If it becomes neces-sary for us to provide crews for the Danish and Norwegian ships of which we mayobtain possession, these difficulties may well become acute. Every effort should therefore be made to induce existing officers and crews of the Norwegianmercantile marine, who are strongly pro-Ally in sympathy, to continue to serve under our flag. We understand that it may not be desirable to adopt this course in other cases.(d) Foreign Exchange.17. The net effect upon our invisible exports and imports of the cessation of trade with the Scandinavian countries is very difficult to estimate.Our payments for shipping services are likely to be smaller. The saving will depend largely upon the extent to which tonnage is transferred to the british flag and freights are paid in sterling. The disbursements in foreign ports and some part of the wages of the crews will still require to be paid in foreign currencies;but the total payment to be made in difficult currencies will be greatly diminished.There will be some loss of earnings from marine insurance; but claims for shipping losses will be met in sterling rather than in foreign currencies,and such payments will in future be retained in London rather thantransferred abroad.   On the other hand, London has in the past provided a
market through which the Scandinavian countries have bought a large partof their imports. The loss of our earnings on this account, together with lossof earnings in respect of insurance (other than marine), commissions, and short-term interest, must be set against the savings in respect of shipping. Finally,there will be a small net loss in respect of investment income from the scandinavian countries, estimated at some  1^ million.18. The further effects upon our exchange position are likely to be more serious. The narrowing of the area within which trade will be possible will forceus to concentrate our purchases to an even greater extent upon the north american countries, though in the case of foodstuffs it will be open to us to buyfrom long-distance sources. We are already using up our reserves of gold andforeign exchange at a very alarming rate, and increased purchases in UnitedStates and Canadian dollars would make our position even more serious. As our purchases in those countries increase, and their demands for our exports approachsatiety, the difficulties of further increasing our exports are likely to becomegreater and the purchasing power of a given quantity of our exports is likely tobecome less.19. Thus, foreign exchange considerations will very probably force us to diminish our food purchases in the North American countries as it becomes necessary to replace from thence those materials, formerly imported fromScandinavia, of which Canada and the United States afford the main alternativesource of supply. If we are obliged to purchase these foodstuffs in more distantmarkets this will certainly aggravate the shipping position.20. It is for this reason most important that before any action is taken toreplace Scandinavian imports, the extent to which these imports have in the pastserved a real need (as contrasted, for example, with the denial of necessities toGermany) should be carefully scrutinised. If it should prove unnecessary toreplace them in full, the loss of the Scandinavian sources of supply may be partially turned to the advantage of our exchange position.(e) The position as regards France.21. In total, the four Scandinavian countries were neither important sources of supply nor important export markets for France; in 1939 they took 3-2 percent, of her exports and provided 1-9 per cent, of her imports (value figures).22. The only important effect of cutting off imports is likely to be on supplies of wood pulp, of which the Scandinavian countries were responsible for two-thirds of France&apos;&quot;s supply. The French purchasing programmes for 1940made provision for some imports of aluminium and special steels from Norway;these will have to be replaced by purchases in Canada and the United States.23. The French export trade to this area was fairly diverse, and, exceptfor some iron and steel chemicals sent to Norway and Sweden and oil cake toDenmark (40,000 tons in 1939), consisted largely of luxuries and semi-luxuries.Thus there will be no appreciable pressure on the Scandinavian countries bythe cessation of French supplies.24. Of considerable importance to France will be the opportunity ofobtaining increased supplies of coal and coke from this country. At the momentthere is a discrepancy of about 10 million tons between current requirements for coal and available supplies from French mines and from imports. Thecorresponding figure for coke is 400,000 tons. It is likely that these deficiencieswill increase as the war effort develops. Our exports to the four scandinavian countries amounted during the first six months of the war to about 5 million tonsof coal and 1 million tons of coke; though these exports would in any case havebeen somewhat reduced in subsequent months. If those supplies which wouldUc-ii k have continued to go to Scandinavia could now available to France, weshould be in a fair way to carry out our undertakings to the French Govern-ment.   Among broader consequences, the increase in French steel output thus
made possible should make it unnecessary for France to buy steel in the UnitedStates, and leave a small surplus available for export to this country; to this may be added the present exports of steel from France to Scandinavia, amountingto some 250,000 tons a year.III.-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES TO GERMANY.25. The economic consequences to, Germany of absorbing Scandinavia withinher own system and of cutting off Scandinavia and the Baltic States from therest of the world are undoubtedly favourable in the short run; but in spite ofcertain permanent gains, are likely, on balance, to be harmful in the long run.(a) Short-term gains in relation to Germany&apos;s present deficiencies.26. Germany&apos;s principal raw material deficiencies at the present momentare in respect of ferro-alloys and non-ferrous metals, petroleum products, rubber,textile fibres, and fats. There are stocks of all these materials in the territories which have been invaded. Most of them are small relatively to the Germanconsumption, but those of the ferro-alloys and, to a less extent, those of thenon-ferrous metals are large enough to be of importance.(i) Raw materials.27. The position as regards the principal groups of raw materials whichwill have fallen into the hands of Germany is as follows :  Ferro-alloys.There are fairly large stocks of ferro-alloys in Norway and Sweden,,including chrome, tungsten and manganese. The gain of these stocks byGermany wouldfte a severe blow to us; for it was at this point that our blockade had hitrperto proved most effective.Non-ferrous Metals.Germany will gain immediately certain stocks of copper and nickel; but these are not large in relation to her requirements.Petroleum Products.Stocks of petroleum products in Denmark amount to 196,000 tons,and in Norway to 272,000 tons, a total of 468,000 tons, of which 33,000 tons are lubricating oils, in respect of which Germany is especially deficient.There are, moreover, further stocks of 492,000 tons of petroleum products in sweden.Textile fibres.There are stocks of textile fibres in Scandinavia, large in relation tothe needs of these countries, but relatively small in relation to those ofGermany.(ii) Food-stuffs.28. The Danish agricultural system is designed to convert feeding-stuffs, asubstantial proportion of which is imported, into animal fats, whether in theform of butter or bacon. At the same time, Denmark is an importer of vegetableand marine fats for her own use.29. It will probably be possible to maintain butter production in Denmarkat the normal rate during the next six months, while the cattle will be feeding ongrass, without the use of imported feeding-stuffs. Production of butter in denmark during this period should exceed her normal consumption by the amount(a) which she would in any case have exported to Germany, and (b) which she would have exported to the United Kingdom. These may be estimated at22,000 tons and 40,000 tons respectively.  In addition, it should be possible in the[21128] c
same period for Germany to increase her gain from this 40,000 tons to 50,000-55,000 tons by imposing on Denmark the German standards of rationing. At theend of the six months&apos; period, there will be the normal seasonal fall in butterproduction, accentuated by the shortage of feeding-stuffs. From then onwards,Germany can look only for a small and diminishing gain in butter resources from denmark.30. With regard to bacon, the position is less clear. The surplus whichwould have been exported to the United Kingdom in the next six months wouldhave been 70,000 tons; but this production can only be achieved if the feeding-stuffs are available. The exact extent of the stocks of animal feeding-stuffs is open to doubt; but they cannot exceed six months&apos; supplies and, to judge from denmark&apos;s efforts to increase imports during recent months, they are likely to be substantially less. The stock position needs to be judged also by reference to thepractice in Denmark of using- the home-grown foods during the winter, andrelying mainly on imported feeding-stuffs during the summer months. Theextent to which it will be possible to convert existing stocks of feeding-stuffs intofats must depend on the degree of control which Germany is able to exercise overDanish agriculture. If egg production is curtailed, and the replacement of the pig population neglected, it is conceivable that, even if Danish stocks of feeding-stuffs are appreciably less than six months&apos; supply, she may be able to extract from denmark a larger quantity of pig products than that country had been intending to export to the United Kingdom.31. Even if, during the next six months, the Danish production of animalfats is not reduced as the result of the occupation, the Germans will not be able tosecure for their own use the surplus which Denmark had intended to export to thiscountry, unless they substantially curtail Danish consumption of fats of all kinds;for, in the meantime, Danish imports of margarine, oilseeds, and whale oil willbe reduced by our blockade; and this should make it necessary for the Danes toconsume a larger percentage of their home-produced fats than hitherto.Assuming that Germany succeeds in diminishing Danish fat consumption while maintaining Danish production, the relief which she will be able to secure forher immediate fat deficiency is relatively small. The total rationed consumptionof edible fats in Germany and the territories in her occupation before recent events is estimated by the Ministry of Economic Warfare at 1-6 million tons perannum. Against this they calculate that the maximum gain in edible fats which germany can look to secure from Denmark during the next six months will notexceed some 75,000 tons, even when account is taken of existing margarine stocks.According to the same estimate, Germany will be unlikely in the twelve monthsfollowing to secure from Denmark supplies of fat in excess of the amount which she obtained there before the occupation. The relief to Germany will thus be no more than temporal in character.(b) Long-term consequences.(i) Gains.32. The long-term consequences favourable to Germany likely to result fromthe control of Scandinavia may be summarised as follows : (a) Germany would be relieved of all anxiety on the score of supplies of iron ore so long as she retained control of the Baltic and was able todraw supplies from the North Swedish mines; the limiting factorwould then be the amount of ore which the Swedish ports and railwayscould handle;(b) her timber supplies are also secure; but it is doubtful whether she wasever in difficulties in this respect;(c) she would be assured of adequate supplies of pyrites if she had it in herpower to transport supplies by sea along the Norwegian Atlanticcoast;(d) she would obtain some relief in respect of nickel and molybdenum;(e) she would obtain the benefit of the use of the specialised steel industry of Sweden.
33. The gold reserves of Denmark and Norway amount to about 31-32 millions (Denmark  12-8; Norway  18-19 millions), while those of sweden amount to about  41-42 millions. In each case, a proportion is heldabroad. The Danish bank laws prohibit the holding abroad of more than a small amount of gold; and it may therefore be fairly assumed that the greater portionof the Danish gold reserve forms part of the German booty. The extent to whichthis booty has been, or may be, increased through seizures of Norwegian gold isnot yet known. Tor a time, Germany should experience less difficulty inimporting essential materials from abroad, but it would be a mistake to suppose that this windfall, even if subsequently increased by the acquisition of part of theSwedish gold reserves, would provide any substantial relief to Germany&apos;sexchange problem.(ii) Losses.34. The main branches of Scandinavian economy cannot easily be adapted to the needs of Germany. Firstly, there will be no market in germany for the huge addition to her supplies of timber and paper-making materials which the normal production of Scandinavia represents.Secondly, it will be impossible in the long run for Germany to main-tain the pig and dairy farming of Denmark (and Sweden), if Scandinavian tradewith the outside world If deprived of their normal imports of marine oils, oilseeds, and maize and other cereals, these countries will not be ableto supply even their own requirements, at any rate at their normal level.Germany may be able to depress the standard of living in the industrial sectionsof the Scandinavian population; but such reductions are notoriously difficult toimpose upon an agricultural population.35. Scandinavia is entirely dependent upon the outside world for itssupplies of coal and coke, oil, and textile fibres. There is already a serious shortage of coal in Denmark. It may be possible for Germany to supply the coal and coke required for the occupied territories; but transport will constitute aserious problem. She will only be able to provide oil and textile fibres by stillfurther curtailing her own consumption.36. In the period immediately following the invasion of the scandinavian countries, Germany stands to lose through the rapid consumption in militaryoperations of her stocks of petroleum products. It will not be until later thatshe will be able to offset some of this loss through making use of the stocksof petroleum which she has seized in Denmark or may seize elsewhere. So faras petroleum is concerned the long-term effects on Germany&apos;s economy are likelyto be adverse, since without increasing her sources of supply, she will haveincreased her commitments both through the extension of military operations and by assuming responsibility for maintaining internal transport and agricul-tural output in the occupied territories.37. Germany&apos;s trade with Scandinavia has been hitherto one of her sources of foreign exchange convertible into dollars. This source will now be closed toher; and her power to import high-valued products through the U.S.S.R. or byway of the Danube may eventually be impaired, except in so far as she is ablefor a time to draw upon the gold reserves referred to in paragraph 33 above.(iii) Man-Power.38. In addition to the material resources now made available to her,Germany may be able to secure for her own use the skilled engineering and shipbuilding labour available in Scandinavia, and the plants in which they areemployed so long as the necessary raw materials are available in these countries.Much of this labour and plant may be directly useful to Germany&apos;s war effort.On the other hand, the task of reorganising the territories which Germany hasnow seized will throw a heavy strain on the German administrative machine whichis already highly taxed.[21128] d
IY. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.39. We summarise as follows the conclusions which, on the assumptionsgiven (paragraphs 3 and 4) we have reached in regard to the probable economic consequences of the seizure of Denmark and Norway by Germany: (a) THE CONSEQUENCES TO THE ALLIES(i) the raw materials where we are likely to encounter difficulties as theresult of the loss of the Scandinavian supplies, in the order of their importance in relation to our war effort, as assessed by the Ministryof Supply, are: (i) timber, (ii) iron-ore, (iii) special steels andferro-alloys, (iv) aluminium, (v) wood pulp, (vi) paper, (vii) calcium carbide, and (viii) a group of much less importance includingarsenic, french chalk, graphite, and hides and calf skins;(ii) the main food-stuffs likely to be affected are bacon, butter, eggs, andfish ; in the case of bacon and butter no great inconvenience will arise;for there are large stocks in the United Kingdom; when these are somewhat reduced, the rations of each can without serious harmrevert to the original level of 1 oz. a week as previouslycontemplated; eggs 33 per cent, of our total supplies of which comefrom the Scandinavian and Baltic Countries taken together arelikely to be seriously short in the autumn, though some small part ofour loss can temporarily be replaced from the Netherlands and othercountries;(iii) as regards British exports, no great injury is probable, though the Boardof Trade anticipates in the case of cotton some difficulty in disposingin other areas of the quantities to be released from the Scandinavianmarkets; the freeing of the supplies of coal and coke hitherto sentto Scandinavian markets will be of definite advantage; for it should put us in a fair way to carry out our undertakings to the FrenchGovernment;(iv) it is too early as yet to form an estimate of the extent to which our shipping difficulties are likely to be aggravated; but it is clear: (1) as regards tanker tonnage, that, if we and the French are notable to secure about the same amount of tonnage as had beenarranged for prior to the invasion of Scandinavia, the petroleumposition both in this country and in France will quickly... become such that both countries will be forced to draw upon their accumulated reserves to an extent which the MinesDepartment would regard as dangerous;(2) as regards tramp tonnage, that unless the amount ofScandinavian tonnage of which the Allies are able to obtainpossession greatly exceeds the half million tons known to bein or near ports in the United Kingdom or France, the volumeof our imports is likely to be substantially reduced; but themain effect on our shipping position will result from thenecessity imposed upon us of obtaining from more distantsources supplies hitherto drawn from Scandinavia; no preciseestimate is at present possible, but it is not unlikely that thenet loss of imports from these several causes may exceed2 million tons per annum;(v) the cessation of trade and financial relations with the scandinavian countries may diminish our foreign payments in respect of shippingpayments, but it will reduce also the invisible earnings which we havehitherto secured from these countries, thanks to our close financialand trading relations with them; the loss of investment income isonly about SX\ millions net;
the narrowing of the area in which trade will be possible will force usto concentrate our purchases on the North American countries; theincreased difficulties with these currencies thus caused may forceus to diminish our food purchases in those markets, and to buymore of them from distant sources, thus further aggravating our shipping difficulties; for these reasons it is most important that, before any action is taken to obtain from other sources, supplies which wehad expected to receive from Scandinavia, the extent to which such imports served a real need should be carefully scrutinised;as regards France, the adverse economic effects are not likely to be considerable; and in the matter of coal and coke are, as indicated in(iii) above, likely to be definitely advantageous.(6) THE CONSEQUENCES TO GERMANY.the short-term consequences to Germany are undoubtedly favourable;for, if she gains possession of the supplies of :-(1) ferro-alloys and other important raw materials in Norway and sweden;(2) fats in Denmark;the Allied blockade is likely to suffer a temporary setback;judged from a long-term standpoint the gains to Germany are lessconsiderable and likely to be offset by losses in other directions;the long-term consequences favourable to Germany likely to result fromthe control of Scandinavia may be summarised as follows: (1) Germany would be relieved of all anxiety on the score of suppliesof iron-ore so long as she retained control of the Baltic andwas able to draw supplies from the North Swedish mines; the limiting factor would then be the amount of ore which theSwedish ports and railways could handle;(2) her timber supplies are also secure; but it is doubtful whethershe was ever in difficulties in this respect;(3) she would be assured of adequate supplies of pyrites if she had it in her power to transport supplies by sea along theNorwegian-Atlantic coast;(4) she would obtain some relief in respect of nickel and molybdenum -,(5) she would obtain the benefit of the use of the specialised steelindustry of Sweden;if, out of the total gold reserves of Denmark and Norway, which amountto  31-32 million (Denmark  12-8 million; Norway  18-19 million),Germany is able to secure the part which was not heldabroad at the time of the invasion, and to a still greater extent if she is able to secure any considerable part of the total Swedish gold reserves of  41-52 million, her difficulties in importing essentialmaterials will be temporarily eased, but it is unlikely that she will obtain thereby any substantial relief to her exchange problem;the long-term consequences unfavourable to Germany are thefollowing: (1) the main branches of Scandinavian economy cannot easily be adapted to the needs of Germany; the Danish agriculturaleconomy depends upon imports of marine oil, oilseeds, and maize and other cereals from abroad; it will only be possible for germany to continue to derive fats from Denmark if feeding-stuffs can be secured from sources accessible to Germany andthe transport to Denmark provided; Germany may be able to depress the standard of living in the industrial sections of the scandinavian population; but such reductions are notoriouslydifficult to impose upon an agricultural population;
(2) Scandinavia is entirely dependent on the outside world for itssupplies of coal and coke, oil, and textile fibres; it may bepossible for Germany to supply the coal and coke required;but transport will constitute a serious problem; she will onlybe able to provide oil and textile fibres by still further curtailingher own consumption; in the period immediately following the invasion of the Scandinavian countries, Germany stands to losethrough the rapid consumption in military operations of herstocks of petroleum products; it will not be until later thatshe. will be able to offset some of this loss through making useof the stocks of petroleum which she has seized in Denmarkor may seize elsewhere; so far as petroleum is concerned thelong-term effects on Germany&apos;s economy are likely to beadverse, since without increasing her sources of supply, shewill have increased her commitments both through the extensionof military operations and by assuming responsibility for maintaining internal transport and agricultural output in the. occupied territories;(3) Germany &apos;s trade with Scandinavia has been hitherto one of hersources of foreign exchange convertible into dollars; this source will now be closed to her; and her power to importhigh-valued products through the U.S.S.R. or by way of the danube may eventually be impaired, except in so far as sheis able for a time to draw upon the geld reserves referred toin conclusion (xi) above.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,April 12, 1940.
