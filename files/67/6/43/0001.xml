SECRET.W.P. (G)(40) 145,51st MAY, 1940./COPY NO.     / UWAR CABINET.DEVELOPMENT OP TIMBER PRODUCTION IN THISCOUNTRY AND PRANCE.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.I circulate a note which has been submitted to theBritish and French Prime Ministers by M. IJonnet, the Chairmanof the Anglo-French Co-ordinating Commi-ctee. upon thesubject of developing home supplies of timber.The Shipping situation is going to render it almost impossible to supply the minimum essential requirements ofthe two countries, unless production from French sources(which are removed from the war zone) is restored, and that from sources in this country greatly develope&amp;o   We aretaking strong steps in this country to develop produce&amp;tionat all costsj but France can of course make a far largercontribution from her more extensive forests.     The limitinfactor is labour, which will have to be imported, and M.Monnet*s proposals are directed to secure that the labour is procured for the two countries and employed to thefullest possible extent.I agree with his proposals and recommend them to theCabinet.     The proposals concern other departments as wellas the Ministry of Supply andj if they are approved, thenecessary contacts will be made.      I understand that theArmy.. Council have agreed that skilled workers from theBritish Dominions for work in France should be enrolledin military Companies under their control*(Intld.)      H. M.Ministry of Supply, W.C.2.

ALLIED TIMBER REQUIREMENTS .NOTE TO TEE BRIT ISH ABB FRENCH PRIME MINI STER3BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AIfGLO-V?.j:I LgCQ-OPJINATING-MBThe ozi girial estimated requirement of the Allies fortimber of all kinds for 1940 were&quot; 15 million tons,      this figure indicated the absolute minimura to which requirementscould he reduceds  as economj.es in the uses cf timber werepushed tc their furthest limit,     Even with the utmosteconomy, however,; certain timber requirements are not beingmete     Thusj for examplej It is stated that try- French.Authorities are able to provide only half of the. miningtimber required by coal mines in France, while it is im-possible for France to fulfil the promise to provide 60*000tons of pitprops per month to South Tales.,      Further theB.E.F.  are able tc obtain only 50% of their requirements ofround, vrood.The seriousness of this situation has been increasedby the invasion of the Low Countries and the intensification of the war.      The requirements of the Allies are therebyconsiderably increased,&apos;    there are increased needs of timberfor fortifications,, a possible need for civilian use in theevent of aerial bombardments and increased requirements invarious other directions.It must also be remembered that the normal source of timber imports of the United Kingdom and France is Russiaariaihe Baltic countries^ With, supplies from these, countriesnow cut off; more distant sources have to be used.  and this involves a marked increase in the need for shipping andforeign exchange t.The matter has, however, become even more serious than this   with the new German offensive.     There is likely to develop a serious limitation of the capacity c&apos;   British and Fren3hports, with France having fewer- ports and Allied ports beingliable to bombardment.      There will thus be a vital need to restrict as much as possible those imports which can be re-restricted, so as to allow of the imports of essential supplies which can not be produced by the Allies.As the Allies are thus faced with an exceedinglyserious situation in regard to their timber supplies, aspecial meeting of the Anglo-French Co-ordinating Committeewas called and held a number of sessions attended not only bythe representatives of the Anglo-French Executive committees for Timber and Snipping, but also by representatives of the directorate of Works and Fortifications, B.3.3?, 5 -one ServiceMilitaire des Eois de Guerre3 the British Timber Control andthe Forestr3r Commission.     The report of this meeting isattached.      It shows that the present rate of production bythe Allies could be more than doubled, from 5-g- million to11^- million tons a years     This increase in production would reduce tne gao between native supplies and essential require-ments from \o\ million to 4-g- million tons a year, and thussecure a very considerable economy in shipping and foreign-exchange.      It would also, to a large extent, safeguard the vital supplies of mining timber and softwoods, in which thesituation is most acute, by eliminating sea risks.      The new developments in the war, which will inevitably increase tnedemand for timber and further endanger the supply of Imports,emphasise the need for immediate action to increase home production.      Such action depends on obtaining considerable

additional supplies of labour and machinery.      The Committeerealises that this course presents some difficulties but itdoes not regard these as at all insuperable^In the light of the conclusions of the report,,- I sug-gest that the War Cabinets of France and Britain should consider the question as a matter of urgency and take thefollowing decisions(1)    Approve a recommendation that home production of timber in France and the United Kingdom shouldbe increased forthwith to the maydmum,(2)    Appyove the felling programme suggested in theattached reports(3)    Direct that all possible assistance should begiven by British and French Departmentsconcerned for the provision of the necessary labour and equipment.Should the two Governments take these decisions. i recommend that they should also direct that a specialAnglo-French Committee should be set up with the duty of ensuring their implementation and of keeping this questionof French and British timber production constantly underreviewo      I suggest that this Committee should have a full-time Chairman and that its members should consist ofrepresentatives of the French Ministry of War, ServiceMilitaire des Bois de Guerre and the Ministry of Labour,and of the British War Office, Ministry of Supply and forestry Commission,(Signed)    JEAN MONNET.gist May, 1940.-2-

BRITISH AM) ffKEifOB TIMBER BggOTBB aiTB AKBPRODUCTION 3(Report of a special meeting of the Anglo-Frencb.Co-ordinating Ccaisaittee on 9th and IGtb. IIaj;? 1940) eBefore the Ifiar;, consumption of timber in France andthe United Kingdom amounted to approximatelyt-Tons c(1,000;s)Uni ted Kingdom. J2, 000)tal Pre-war consumptions. 3 o O20.t590These requirements were nset in France fr-oia native timber(witli the exception o  imports of about 1,000?000. tons),whilst home production In the United Kingdoms amounted to only about 500,000 tons and virtually the entire requirement of the United Kingdom orefore, suppxied. from abroacUIn particular 75^ of United Kingdom imports of softwoods,which, accounted for- half the total consumption, case fromScandinavia, Russia, and the Baltic countries*Supplies from Russia and the Baltic eountrie arenow cut off and the possibility of supplies from other sources is severely limited owinjj to considerations ofshipping and finance^      The following table  of anticipatedconsumption in France and the United Kingdom has been drawnup with these considerations In mind ana cannot,  therefore,be said to represent even the lEiniiauffiJ necuireBients formilitary and essential civil purposes: -French Forces and internalconsumption in Frances, o .* * * 7,7&quot;S0Tons cBoSoF. 280 8-090United Kingdom - - ,.   ,......-0,**.*.*.*.. * a ,3,000?otal present requirements^16,C00It should be further emphasised that the above tablewas drawn up before the invasion of Holland and Belgium^In view of this development it Is considered thatrequirements for the BoBeP* should no?/ be estimated at500,000 tons for 1940,  and that an Increase in therequirements of French Forces will be Inevitable owingto the extension of the Frontc     Further-., wide scalebombing of British and French towns would entail a large increase in essential civil requirements In both countries *

It should, he explained that the comparatively smalldifference &quot;between pre-war consumption and reduced wartime requirements in France, as revealed in the abovetables, is due to the very large requirements of timberfor the Western Front.Production of native timber before the War amountedapproximately to:-Tgns.(1.000&apos;s)France.... ... .. . .. o . . . . . . ....... 7,000United Kingdoms ................      500Total pre-war production.......o?r500Owing to mobilisation, production in France is nowrunning at the rate of only about 4 million tons perannum.      It is estimated, however,  (see table annexed)that, looking at the question solely from the point ofview of the capacity of the French forests,  this production could be increased to 9 million tons per annum..In the United&apos;Kingdom, it is estimated that 6^million tons of mining timber and 2-g- million tons of sawnsoft woods could be made available in all by drasticfelling.      Since, however, the mining timber would beless seasoned than imported    timber, the 64- million tonsrepresent the equivalent of only just over 5 million tonsof imported timber.      Allowing for this conversion,production could be increased from the present rate of nearly 1-g- million tons to 2-g- million tons a year.The development of a programme of production on this scale in the two countries is, however, dependent on two factors, namely the supply of labour and the supply ofmachinery.As regards labour,  the position in the two countries is as follows:-(l)    In the United Kingdom all skilled foresters arealready employed and 2,000 Newfoundlandersbrought in since the outbreak of war are atwork.      In order to increase the rate ofproduction to what is considered the practicalmaximum, it is estimated that 10,000 additionalskilled workers and 5,000 additional unskilled workers will be required.     Whilst all thislabour should be made available as soon aspossible, 3,000 of the skilled workers are most urgently required to fulfil the presentproduction programme for 1940, of 1,800-&apos;, 000tons (the equivalent of 844,000 tons of imported timber) of mining timber and325,000 tons of sawn softwoods.      Though thepresent rate of production fulfilsexpectation, a considerable leeway has to bemade up from the winter months, when bad weather seriously handicapped production.

v(-2-)    In Franco, all skilled fore&amp;tev: v-ho arc notmdbillse4 arc being employed as well as a certainnumber of Spanish, refugees,,    A certain amount of portuguese labour is being obtained; but, in orderto achieve the pregramme outlined above;, it willbe necessary to obtain an additional 17,000skilled and 51^000 unskilled workers,,It will thus be seen that, in order to achieve themaximum production of which the British and French Forests are capable, it will be necessary for the two countries to importa total of 27,000 skilled workers and 56,000 unskilled workers.As regards skilled workers? whilst it may be possible toobtain small numbers from Finland, Portugal or Norway, it isclear that it will be necessary to rely mainly on the british dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.    As regards the unskilled workers, it is anticipated that the 5,000 requiredfor the United Kingdom can be provided from home sources, butthat the 51,000 required for France will have to be importeaUIt is the general opinion that skilled workers from theBritish Dominions for work in France can only be furnished inthe form of military companies.    This is not necessarily thecase in respect of skilled workers provided from the Dominionsfor work in the United Kingdom, but in t-h:&quot;.c case, too, it maybe possible for a large proportion to come as militarycompanies.    It is suggested,  therefore,  that it should be theresponsibility of the British War Office, in consultation sofar as may be necessary with the British Foresty Commission tomake the necessary arrangements with the British dominions office and the Foreign Office for every effort to be made tosecure the provision from the Dominions of the skilled workersrequired both in the United Kingdom and France.    Whilst exactdetails would have to be worked out later, It is further suggested that Dominions Forestry Companies for service inFrance should be organised and equipped by the British WarOffice and that the timber felled by them should be used tosupply requirements of the B.E.F*  and of France, any surplusbeing used for the requirements of the United Kingdom.It will of course be the responsibility of the BritishMinistry of Labour to provide the 5?000 unskilled workmen forthe United Kingdom,,    As regards the 51,000 unskilled workers for work in France, it is suggested that the French Ministryof Labour should be responsible, and obtain as necessary theassistance of the competent French or British Departments inobtaining labour from the French or British Empires or from foreign Countries.    Whilst all this labour is urgently required,it should be noted that the greatest urgency is the need for skilled workers, since additional unskilled workers cannot beused unless the additional skilled workers required to trainand direct them have already been obtained:,It is important to note that in both France and theUnited Kingdom,  the additional labour required would need avery substantial amouirfe of additional machinery, though some progress could be made by the use of certain mills not atpresent producing to capacity.    In general, it may be con-sidered that any Forestry Companies which it may be possible toraise in the British Dominions should come equipped with theirown machineryc &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; -- ..

The-foilowing are the main conclusions to be drawn fromthe situation described above:-It is essential that home production of timber inthe United Kingdom and Prance should be increasedto the maximum.This involves not only a deastic felling programme in both countries, but also the supply of addition-al labour and machinerycThe total additional labour required in both countries is 27?COO skilled workers and 56?000 unskilledworkersc    Of these,  only 5,000 unskilled workersrequired in the United Kingdom can be found in theHome OountriesoWhilst the unskilled workers required from abroad,can be obtained from a number of different sources,the majority at any rate of the 27,000 skilled workers can only be provided by Canada, New Zealand,and Australia0The need for the skilled workers in the absence ofwhom additional unskilled workers could not be effectively used,  is a matter of extreme urgency.(1)(2)(o)(4)(5)
