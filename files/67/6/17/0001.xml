Reference:I.W.B.(hO)  2nd Mtg.THE POSSIBILITY OF SUPPLYING FOOD TO NORWAY.Report of Sub-Committee of War Cabinet Committee onCo-ordination of Departmental Action.1 . The Committee of the War Cabinet on Co-ordination of departmental Action agreed, at a meeting held on Saturday,27th April, 1940, to invite a sub-committee (under thechairmanship of Sir Henry French, with representatives ofthe Foreign Office, Treasury, Admiralty, War Office, Ministryof Economic Warfare and Ministry of Shipping) &quot;to consider and report on the question whether it would be practicable to supply food for the civilian population in Norway if itwere decided in principle that this was desirable&quot;.2. On Monday, April 29th, 194-0, the Sub-Committee met,its membership (list attached) including a representative ofthe Dominions Office in addition to the representativesmentioned above.The Chairman put before the Sub-Committee the text ofthe following message sent by the Commanaer-in-Ghief of theNorwegian Army on April 25th to the Norwegian Minister inLondon, M. Colban, which had been communicated by M. Colbanto the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on April 26thand which had been the occasion of the discussion at themeeting of the Committee on Co-ordination of departmental action on April 27th mentioned above

&quot;As we have new given up the districts whichyield most and have mainly mountainousdistricts left, our supply of foodstuffwill soon he exhausted.     We therefore askLegation to apply to the proper authoritiesrequesting that food and fodder he sent tothe country in the course of the comingt?/o weeks.RUGE,&quot;The Sub-Committee considered that this messageimplied a request for foodstuffs, not only for the use ofthe civilian population of Norway, but also for the military.It decided, therefore, not to confine itself rigidly tothe letter of its terms of reference but to consider theproblem of food supplies for Norway as a whole.Besides the message from the Norwegian Commander-in-Chief, the Sub-Committee had before it two other despatches.The first, dated April 26th, from the British Minister in stockholm, drew attention to the needs of the civilian population in Norway and urged that an attempt should bemade to meet those needs.     Supplies from Sweden were netavailable owing to enemy action in interrupting roadcommunications.      The second despatch, received on April27th, was from the British Consul at Tromstt to the NorwegianLegation.      It mentioned the need of additional food supplies for Northern Norway, especially of flour, margarine, cake,meals and grain.3. As regards the practicability of supplying foodstuffsfor the Norwegian Army, the Sub-Committee understood thatthe British military authorities were anxious to build upreserves of food supplies in addition to those already attheir disposal in Norway and that such claims must be a first-charge on any supplies  that could be shipped in the near future.

The Sub-Committee agreed that any foodstuffs which it mightbe decided to send for the use of the Norwegian Army shouldtake the same form as supplies despatched for the use of theBritish Army in Norway and should be regarded as a responsibility of the War Office.      The distribution ofsuch supplies inside the country would need to be under-taken by the Norwegian authorities.      Insofar as additional supplies were made available for the Norwegian Army, the pressure on local food supplies would be relieved and the civilian population might to that extent benefit.The remainder of this report refers to the problemof supplying food for the civilian population in Norway,U* It was assumed that there would be no question of sending foodstuffs to Southern Norway as these would helikely to fall into German hands.The representative of the Ministry of Economic War-fare stressed the undesirability of allowing any foodstuffs&quot;to reach Southern Norway, even through the agency of relief Organisations.5, It was agreed that to ship foodstuffs to the Narvikarea and to ports north of Narvik was urima facie practic-able.    There was likely, however, to be difficulty inunloading stores and in the distribution of them to thepopulation.6. The size of the civilian population in parts of norway not controlled by the enemy was not known.     Thepopulation of the four northernmost provinces of Norway,Finmark, Troms, Nordland, Nord-Trondelag, numbers some437,000;    and in the area further south (to Fogne Fjord,near Trondhjem) there is an additional population ofsome 340,000.      An outside figure, therefore, for thepopulation in question would be 800,000.      The Sub-Committee

..h.a&amp; no information as to the practicability of distributingamong this population such foodstuffs as might be landed in the Narvik area and north thereof.7. It was agreed that foodstuffs of suitable kindscould be made available in sufficient quantities to make full use of any transport facilities that could, bo supplied.In particular, flour (including yeast), canned meat,margarine and/or butter could he found, if necessary.The most convenient method, however, of sendingfoodstuffs to Norway might prove to &quot;be by the despatch of norwegian vessels containing foodstuffs which are at presentsheltering in British ports.      The Ministry of shipping had detailed information, concerning the cargoes of such vessels and the position of other Norwegian vessels nowat sea.      If it were decided that certain of these vessels should proceed to Northern Norway, the Ministry of shipping would welcome the opportunity of persuading the owners ofthe other Norwegian vessels in British ports to discharge their cargoes, a course which at present the owners seemedunwilling to take.8. It was agreed that so long as the supply of foodstuffto Norvifay from the United Kingdom was on a small scale, nodifficulty was likely to arise in regard to the means of payment for them.      Under the terms of the existingPayments Agreement between the two countries, funds wereavailable to the credit of Norwegian nationals.      It wastherefore assumed that the Norwegian Government would, haveno difficulty in paying from its own resources for fool-stuffs supplied to Norway from the United Kingdom.-k-

If Norwegian vessels originally destined for southern norway were despatched to the North, care must he taken thatno payments made in respect of their cargoes should accrue to Norwegian nationals in parts of Norway now under enemy control.9.    Summary of Conclusions.(a) It is assumed that no food supplies will he allowed to enter Southern Norway or any partof the country now under enemy control.(b) Transport of foodstuffs to the Narvik area and north thereof would be orima facie practicablethough difficult.(c) Insofar as facilities for transport and landingare available, foodstuffs of suitable kinds canbe supplied from United Kingdom sources.(d) The simplest method of sending food supplies mightbe by the despatch to Northern Norway of Norwegianships containing suitable cargoes at presentsheltering in British ports.(Signed)    H.L.
