W A R      CABINETRELATIONS WITH ITALY:      COAL SUPPLIESNote by the President of the Board of Trade.With regard to the Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister ofEconomic Warfare - W.P.(G.)(h0)l09 - on relationswith Italy, I circulate herewith, for theconsideration of the War Cabinet, a Memorandum by theSecretary for Mines on the subject of coal supplies for italy.COPY NO.13Board of Trade.A.R.D4

Relations with Italy.Goal Supplies.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary for Mines.There are two comments which I think I ought to makeconcerning Paragraph 8(v) of W.P.(G)(40)l09, which recommends that&quot;the present guarantee facilities for Italianpurchases of their requirements of coal should becontinued for the time being up to the rate of4 million tons a year, provided that the arrearsin payments are not -considerably increased&quot;.1. Unless we can achieve a substantial increase in coaloutput, or reduce home consumption, we shall not be able tosupply coal to Italy at the rate of 4 million tons a year,except at the expense of French demands or of supplies toother important neutrals.With a saleable output at the present rate of about245 million tons a year, the margin for export cannot beestimated at more than 2.8 million tons a month.The maintenance of exports to important neutrals (includingItaly at 100,000 tons) would require 1,3 million tons a month;and with France now asking for 2.15 million tons a month, weare already in difficulty.    Indeed, we have told the Frenchwe can supply only 1.5 million tons during May and they maybring the question of supplies in subsequent months beforethe Supreme Council for decision.If the figure for Italy is to be 4 million tons a year,or, say, 330,000 tons a month, our difficulties with Franceand other neutrals will be enhanced.2. I fear that the present guarantee facilities may proveinadequate.    For the last two months the normal exportguarantee of 7b% has been increased to 90% for coal to Italy,and on this basis the trade have continued shipping.    It isclear, however, that the trade is becoming increasinglynervous about the extent of its outstandings &apos; in Italy, and

they have now informed me definitely that in presentconditions they cannot continue shipments to Italy afterthe end of this month unless the guarantee is raised to100%.I fear, therefore, that it is impossible in presentcircumstances to provide Italy with coal at the rate of4 million tons a year,   save at the expense of othermarkets which are vital to our war effort.I understand, however that 100,000 --150,000 tonsa month is all that Italy now thinks that she can at present afford to buy from us,  and all that she islikely to ask for.G.L.Mines Department,22nd April, 1940.
