Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 122.WAR CABINET.SURVEY  OF  EMPLOYMENT   (ENGINEERING;  MOTOR  and aircraft GROUP).W.P. (G.) (40) 118.Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THIS Report suggests that in this fundamental group, at any rate, wehave hardly begun to organise man-power for the production of munitions.In E.P. (M.) (39) 51 it was estimated that a very large expansion, amountingto 71-5 per cent, of the number engaged in the metal industry, would be needed in the first year of war. Actually the engineering, motor and aircraft group,which covers three-fifths of the metal industry and which is discussed in thissurvey, has only expanded by 11-1 per cent. (122,000) between June 1939 and april 1940.* This is less than one-sixth of the expansion stated to be required.Without any Government intervention, by the mere improvement of trade, thenumber increased as quickly as this in the year 1936-37.Although 350,000 boys leave school each year there is an increase of only25,000 in the number of males under 21 employed in this group. Moreover theproportion of women and young persons has only increased from 26 - 6 per cent,to 27-6 per cent. In the engineering, motor and aircraft group, we now have only 1 woman for every 12 men. During the last war the ratio of women to menin the metal industries increased from 1 woman for every 10 men to 1 womanfor every 3 men. In the first year of the last war, July 1914 to July 1915, thenew workers drafted into the metal industries amounted to 20 per cent, of those already there (E.P. (M.) (40) 8). In the group under survey, which may fairly be taken as typical of the whole metal industry, only 11 per cent, have been addedin the last ten months.w. s. c.May 4, 1940.* Admiralty Establishments, in which employment has increased by nearly 27 per cent.,have not been considered here, as no figures for the different types of labour are given.[21234]
