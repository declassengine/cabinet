THIS-document IS THE PROPERTY OP HTfi BRITANNIA MA.TESTY&apos;S GOVERNS.SECRET.W.F.  (G)  (40) 115. COPY NO.   *389th April, 1940.WAR   CABINETCONTROL OF ALIENS  &apos;Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1, At their meeting on the 21st March, 1940 (D.C.O.S.(40) 13th Meeting Minute^) the Deputy Chiefs of Staffrecorded the following conclusion, inter alia:&quot;Suggested that the question of adopting astricter policy regarding the control of aliensshould be examined with a view to determining whether this would reduce the risks of sabotage,and consequently permit a reduced scale ofprotection for Vulnerable Points:    and that thissuggestion should be referred for considerationto the Civil Defence Committee&quot;.2. The risk of interference with the war effort ofthe country by any disaffected or hostile persons amongthe civilian population is a matter to which much attention has been given by the Home Office in consultationwith M.1.5 and the police;    and there appears to be nolikelihood that measures for the control of aliens, whateverform those measures might take, would materially affectthe need for guarding vulnerable points.     Potential risks tothese points do not arise merely from persons of foreignnationality.     Acts of sabotage may be committed by Britishsubjects, including Irish extremists, extremists amongst british Communists or Fascists and persons who, though born injthe United Kingdom and therefore possessing British nationalitj,are of foreign origin and associations.

Moreover, it would obviously be impracticable to intern allaliens who are nationals of friendly or neutral states, andagents sent by the enemy into this country are perhaps more likely to be found amongst the non-enemy aliens than amongstpersons of German or Austrian nationality.     Accordingly,even if all Germans and. Austrians were interned, there would still be need of adequate protection for points where acts of sabotage- would cause grave interference with essential services and with the production of munitions.5- Although, however, the control of aliens has, in my view, little relevance to the guarding of vulnerable points,it is, I think, desirable that the general question of controlof aliens - a question on which public feeling is easilyexcited and misunderstandings easily arise - should bediscussed.     The question concerns (I) aliens who arenationals of friendly and neutral states, and (II) germans and Austrians,I.    NON-ENEMY ALIENS.4. Apart from those who are resident in this country,there are aliens allowed to enter the country for shortvisits, specially visits for trade purposes.     If thequestion qould be considered solely from the point ofview of security, it would no doubt be desirable to reduce to a minimum the number of these visiting aliens, but theimportance of maintaining our trade relations makes itdesirable to grant facilities for such visits, subject, ofcourse, to a careful check by means of the visa system andby close examination0of passengers arriving at ports,

5.        Special precautions are also taken with regard to the crews of neutral ships arriving at our ports.     At certainports.arrangements are made to prevent foreign crews fromlanding, but there is no possibility of preventing thempicking up such information as is obtainable by observationfrom their ships of what is going on in the ports.6. As regards resident aliens, they are required to register with the police, and a.careful watch is kept on anyactivities which give grounds for suspicion.     Some non-enemy aliens have been interned under Defence Regulation l8B.This Regulation can be used in any case whore the Home secretary has reasonable cause to believe (a) that the person is of hostile origin or associations or has been concerned in actsprejudicial to the public safety etc. and (b) that by reasonthereof it is necessary to exercise control over him,7-        For the purpose of reducing the risk of informationbeing conveyed to the enemy, certain ports and the surroundingareas have also, at the request of the Admiralty, been declaredprotected areas.     The Order relating to these areas provides(1) that no alien who is not ordinarily resident in such an area may come into such an area, either for a visit or for thepurpose of residence-, without the permission of the police, and(2) that the Home Secretary may order the removal from sucharea of any alien resident in the area, whatever the nationality of the&quot;alien.     Every alien resident in a protected area hasbeen required to furnish the police with particulars abouthimself and his reason for wanting to continue to reside in thearea.     The police have been instructed to examine these casescarefully and to divide them into cwo categories -- (a)   ohoj

about whose reliability they feel no doubt, and (b)  those withregard to whom they think the question of removal from the areaought to be considered.    The cases of all aliens in the lattercategory are to be considered by Regional Committees appointed for the purpose, and the Committees will advise the HomeSecretary whether the removal of an alien is desirable on security grounds.    These arrangements for protected areasapply equally to Germans and Austrians and to aliens of othernationalities.II.    GERMANS AND AUSTRIANS.8.     In the days immediately preceding and immediately following the outbreak of war, many Germans were allowed to return to theirown country.    It was agreed by the Service Departments that theaddition of these people to the German manpower would make little difference and that it was better to let them go than to impose on this country the burden of interning, guarding and feedingthem.    Except,  therefore, for a very small number of men whowere detained because their special technical qualificationsmight be useful to the enemy,  those Germans and Austrians who wished to leave the United Kingdom were allowed to do so, andthe result was that a large proportion of those Germans whohad Nazi sympathies were eliminated from our alien population.9.     Before the outbreak of war, M.I.5 had prepared a list ofsome 700 Germans who were known to be Nazi adherents or had beensuspected of pro-German activities.      Of these,  some went backto Germany before the outbreak of war,  and the remainder wereinterned immediately.      The number so interned was about 300.10.    As regards the remaining Germans it was known that a largeproportion of them were refugees,  and that the remainder

included many people with long residence here, who hadthrown in their lot with this country,  a number of themhaving British-born wives and British-born children.    my predecessor in office decided that any general measure of internment of such persons on the mere ground that they possessedGerman or Austrian nationality was unnecessary on security grounds and inexpedient on grounds of general policy.    In1915 when wholesale measures of internment were adopted,  theposition was very different from that obtaining in 1939.Before the outbreak of war in August, 1914,  there had been no effective control over the entry of aliens into this countryand no requirement that aliens should register themselves with the police.    Consequently comparatively little was known about the alien population and there had been no check on thepurposes for which Germans had been allowed to visit or settle in this country.    Since 1914 there has been a provision thatno alien shall land in this country without the permission of an Immigration Officer, and in order to obtain permissionit is necessary for the alien to show some sufficient reason for being allowed to come into the United Kingdom.Although the control of passenger traffic has not, ofcourse,  eliminated the possibility of Germans or otheraliens coming here for purposes different from theirostensible purposes,  it has at any rate prevented thesettlement in this country of large and unkown numbers of germans who may be anxious to assist the enemy.11.   While, however,  it was decided that there should notbe a policy of general internment,  it was felt that theinformation available to the Home Office and to M.I.5 oughtto he supplemented by an individual examination of the case

of every German and Austrian over the age of sixteen inthe United Kingdom.    For this purpose men of legalexperience were appointed to act as local tribunals, andthese local tribunals,- after interviewing the individualaliens and hearing all that was known about them,including information given by the police, classified them into three groups:    Category A - those who were ordered to&quot;be interned;    Category B - those who were exempted from internment but not from certain special restrictions onmovement and on the possession of certain articles, suchas cameras,  telescopes,  etc;    and Category C - those whowere exempted both from internment and from the special restrictions.12.    The result of the examinations conducted by the localtribunals was as follows:569   were interned;6,782   were exempted from internment but not from thespecial restrictions;    and64,244   were classified as friendly or neutral aliensand exempted both from internment and fromthe special restrictions.Of the 73,353 examined by the tribunals, 55,457, or 75%,wereclassified as refugees.13.   Does the small number of those interned indicate either(a) that the instructions given to the tribunals by the HomeOffice were unduly favourable to the alien, or (b)  that the tribunals were lax in their examinations and decisions?14.(a) The instructions given to the tribunals by the HomeOffice made it clear that internment was not to be limitedto persons against whom prejudicial evidence could be produced.

On the contrary, the tribunals were told that in all casesthe onus lay on the alien to satisfy the tribunal that hecould properly be exempted from internment.    It was pointedout in the Home Office instructions that amongst the germans and Austrians there might be &quot;men or women of good characterwho, if they acted in a manner prejudicial to this country,would do so with a sense of duty and loyalty to their own country&quot;, and that good character was by no means a reasonfor exempting than from internment.    The tribunals werespecifically instructed that,  in cases of doubt, the doubtshould be resolved in favour of national security.15.(b)    Examination in the Home Office of a number of casesreviewed by the tribunals suggests that in general they didtheir work with care and with a bias towards internment indoubtful cases.    Indeed in some of the cases where internmentwas ordered by the tribunals it has subsequently been shown on a further examination by the Central Advisory Committeeon Internment cases, of which Mr. Norman Birkett is Chairman,that the suspicions which influenced the tribunal werebaseless and that the alien can safely be released.16.   Nevertheless,  in case the local tribunals may have failed in any cases to impose proper measures of control,arrangements have been made for a further review.    regional commitees have been appointed for each of the twelve civil defence Regions and these Committees have been instructedto carry out a further review for three purposes:17.   First,  they are to review all cases of Germans and austrians placed in Category B,  that is the intermediatecategory, of persons exempted from internment hut notexempted from the special restrictions.    The tribunals, by

placing these aliens in an intermediate category, have indicated that their cases present elements of doubt, and review by the Regional Committees will furnish theSecretary of State with a second opinion.      The regional commitees will be able to revise the classification in either direction and to order,-if they think fit,  either that the alien shall be interned, or that he shall be exempted both from internment and from the special restrictions,18,    Secondly, the police have been told to bring beforethe Regional Committees for further review any German orAustrian placed by the tribunals in Category C (i.e. exemptedboth from internment and the special restrictions)  if,  as aresult of fresh information or for any other reason, theydoubt the alien&apos;s reliability from a security point of view.19.    Thirdlyp as regards protected areas,  the regional commitees will review all aliens, whether they are of enemynationality or nationals of a neutral state, about whom thepolice feel that it is doubtful whether, from a securitypoint of view, the alien should be allowed to continue to reside in the protected area.20.    These examinations first by the tribunals and later bythe Regional Committees are designed to supplement and not tobe in substitution for direct administrative action by theHome Office,    If any information becomes available to the HomeOffice as a result of reports from the police or from M.I.5shoeing, to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State, thata German or Austrian ought to be interned, orders for hisinternment can and would at once be given.-21.   Having regard to the above mentioned arrangements and

considerations, what further measures can he taken in thedirection of &quot;a stricter policy regarding the control of aliens&quot;?     If this suggestion means that a larger numberof Germans and Austrians should be interned, on what basisis that larger number to be selected?   Unless it be suggestedthat Germans and Austriane should be interned merely becausethey possess enemy nationality and without regard to whatis known about them individually, about their dispositiontowards this country, and their reasons for being in theUnited Kingdom, no justifiable basis for an increase inthe number of internees can be found.    Obviously no decision that a purely arbitrary proportion of Germans and austrians should be interned could be justified.    Nor would the internment of an arbitrary proportion without regard tothe characters and circumstances of the individuals have any value for security purposes.25.    The choice for the Government is between (a) the policyof individual examination on the lines hitherto adopted, or(b) a policy of wholesale internment, or at any rate the internment of specified categories, on the basis that the possession of German or Austrian nationality,  irrespective of what is known about the individual, is a reason for internment.    The objections to the latter course are obviously grave.    Such a course would be wasteful of man-power, both by immobilising a substantial number of personsrequired to guard and manage the internment camps and bydepriving this country of the services of the well-disposedaliens who are willing to assist the national effort byjoining the Pioneer Corps or by placing their technical qualifications and experience at the service of the country

in industry where there is a shortage of skilled workers.Moreover,  the internment of persons to whom this country has offered asylum from Nazi oppression would offend large sections of public opinion in this, country, and would bedifficult to reconcile with our policy of trying to securesupport from such sections of German opinion as may be opposed to the Nazi creed.24,    The effect on world opinion, and particularly on american opinion, of a policy of wholesale internment of germans and Austrians is a consideration to which my colleagues will no doubt attach considerable importance.    At the beginningof this war,  the American Government made representations tothe belligerents expressing the earnest hope that the belligerent Governments would find means of avoiding- thegeneral practice followed in the last war of interningcivilian enemy aliens.    His Majesty&apos;s Government,  in a reply dated the 24th November last, welcomed the intervention of the American Government in this matter and,  in declaringtheir readiness to adhere to a policy designed to spareinnocent persons unnecessary suffering, announced their decision not to resort to wholesale internment of enemy aliens as was done in the last war, but instead to adopt apolicy of individual examination.      Similar assurances weregiven by the German Government, which pledged itself that nomass internment of British civilians would take place andthat the internment of British civilians would be ordered bythe competent authorities only after careful examination ofthe individual case.    In communicating the German pledge to His Majesty&apos;s Government, the American Embassy,  in a note

dated the 21st February last, said that the AmericanGovernment &quot;hopes that the accord reached will establish a permanent precedent for international law which will standas a future example of the humane treatment to be accordedcivilian enemy aliens in cases of belligerency&quot;.25.   The Home Office is fully conscious of the need for maintaining the closest watch over the aliens in this countryand for interning all Germans and Austrians about whosereliability doubt may be felt.    Internment is not limitedto cases where something specific can be proved againstthe alien but is applied to all Germans and Austrians who cannot satisfy careful investigators that they can safely beleft at large.    If a high proportion of them can pass thistest, it is submitted that it would be wrong to reverse thepolicy merely on the ground that the number left at libertyis large.J.A.HOME OFFICE.
