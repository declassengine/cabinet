I think that my colleagues should see the attached:i telegram NOo 155 of the 17th April (Annexure A) whichiI have received from the Government of the Commonwealth^of Australia regarding the anxiety with which they view)any measures on our part likely to be provocative to japan.2.      This telegram follows upon a telegram No. 153 ofthe 16th April (Annexure .3) of which also I attach acopy.      The latter message was directed more specifically to the instructions which it was understood had been or were being issued to the Commander-in-Chief, ChinaStation, with a view to the exercise of contraband control in the Par East as part of the measures recentlyagreed with the French Government in order to preventgoods likely to be of use in the prosecution of the war from reachinp- Germany through Soviet Russiao     I attachcopies of the telegrams (Circular D No. 123 of the 13thApril and No0 124 of the 14th April) which were addressedto Dominion Government? on this matter (Annexures C and D)3&quot;     My colleagues will appreciate that this attitudeof anxiety on Australia1s part is no new development.

It-was -expressed ear liar this month in a message fromMr. Menzies which reached me through the High Commissionerfor the Commonwealth in London on the 5th April, fromwhich I attach the relevant passage (Annexure E) o     this message was sent in reply to a preliminary communication of the.conclusions reached at the meeting of the supreme war Council on the 23th Marcho     But it may he recalled that earlier in the war. &quot;before a decision was reached&quot;by the Commonwealth Government to despatch an expeditionary force from Australia,  it was necessary forus to reassure the Commonwealth Government as to our general relations with Japan and? indeed,  to give thema specific assurance that in our view the political position in the Far East was such that the Commonwealth&apos;ssafety would not in any way be jeopardised if an australian force proceeded, to the immediate theatre ofwar.     Reference may also be made to the papers preparedfor the visiting Dominion Ministers in November, 1-939,(DcMoVo(39) 2 and 4)o      It was on the basis of the appreciation of the Far Eastern situation given in thes^edocuments that Mr..0 Casey? the Commonwealth Minister who.was then in London, advised his Government in favour ofthe early despatch of the first Australian contingent.4.      It appears to be doubtful at present whether weshall be able to carry the Commonwealth Government with us in our proposed policy as outlined in Annexures Cand Do     These telegrams to the Dominion Governments were based upon telegrams sent by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to H.M. Ambassadors at Tokyo and washington, which fli^ rot contain instructions forimmediate action but informed them of the measures tohe taken against the Soviet Union and asked for theirviews upon the proposed negotiations with Japan and on certain parallel action to be taken in Washington.

I wouljd-jsuggesiiJ2ar.j;he consideration of mycolleagues: -(a) that the views of the commonwealth government and of the other DominionGovernments when they are received,should he carefully examined inconjunction with the replies expected from Hoivi* Ambassadors at Tokyo andWashingtoni(b) that the orders which were about tobe issued to the Commander-in-Chief,China Station, for the interceptionand diversion of neutral ships,  should if possible be suspended for the present.This may, I assume, involve parallelaction by the French Government;and, given affirmative decisions on(a) and (b),(c) that I should be authorised to informthe Commonwealth Government that our intentions are as at (a) and that action is being taken as at (b).(Initialled)    ArE.Dominions Office.Ivth  April, 1940 o

Governmentshaving to consider proposals involving the extension ofwar measures, especially in regard to economic warfare, wewould ask to he informed immediately of important issuesaffecting the Far East, especially action likely to he regarded by Japan as provocative or discriminatory.You will appreciate our anxiety to maintainstahility in this region and we would like to be consultedbeforehand on any such proposal in order to he given anopportunity of submitting our views before a final decision is reached.

B.CYPHER TELEGRAM.COMMONWEALTH OP AUSTRALIA.From the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia.Dated 16th April;, 1940, Received 3o44 p0m, 16th April.IMMEDIATE.No. 153,    Most SecreteYour telegram No.  123 Circular D of 13th April.We are gravely concerned at the issue of orders to China Station to intercept ships destined directly or indirectly for Vladivostock, especially in the light ofmy telegram of 4th April which expressed our consideredview that such action would be provocative and ineffective.It would seem from reports issued by the Ministryof Economic Warfare that the major stream of traffic viaTrans Siberian Railway emanates from American sources and action being taken would check minor stream only, ascarried on mainly by Japanese and Dutch vessels voyageingalong southern routes,Further, the proposal outlined in your telegramNo. 124 Circular D.to negotiate an agreement with Japan toreduce export of vital commodities to Russia and germany is out of harmony with the decision now in question andseems likely to be nullified at the outset.From the broadest    aspect it appears to my Governmentthat the war is entering on the vital and critical stagewhen it is enenmbent on us not to precipitate matters either with Italy, Russia or Japan.     With the first two it can beassumed that a decision by them to participate will be quite outside Allied control . but with Japan the issue maywell depend on our own conduct and actions.

that apart from the disquieting effect on theAustralian position we feel that in general interest of theAllied effort that the gain to he achieved by interceptionand diversion of ships in the Par East is not commensurate with the risks involved.      In this respect we are bound tosay that the proposal for a negotiated agreement should inour opinion, be first put into effect and then if these negotiations in fact fail, further consideration can begiven to the more drastic action of direct interception.For these reasons we urge that orders already givenbe immediately reviewed byfore untoward incidents canoccur.     Ends.

Circular Dc No0  123.    SECRET.In connection with possibility of tightening upblockade against Germany we have examined, in consultationwith the French authorities-, the measures open to us inrespect of control of imports into Asiatic Russia.     We have reason to believe that it will shortly be possible for germany to develop the importation of deficiency commoditiesof relatively high price and small bulk over the Trans-Siberian Railway and though we are ready to explorepossibilities that may offer we feel unable to place any confidence in such assurances of non-re-export as may be forthcoming from the Soviet Government.The immediate action open to us appears to be:(a) the imposition of drastic restrictions on exports toRussia in so far as restrictions have not already been imposed;(b) the interception and diversion for examinationprincipally in Indo-Chinese ports of ships of all. nationsthought to be carrying cargo to suspect destination.We are taking immediate steps in regard to both these courses of action,,As regards (b), orders have been sent to theCommander-in-chief, China Station to intercept ships ifpossible south of a line 21G21 mins, north destined directly or indirectly for Vladivostok;    Japanese ships from SouthEast Asia,are in no case to be intercepted North of this.T.60/17.CYPHER TELEGRAM.CIRCULAR,To the Governments of Canada, Commonwealth of Australia,New Zealand, Union of South Africa.Sent 9.15 p.m,, 13th April, 1940.

JJLne. and interception is not to be carried out withinsight of the Japanese coast.Similar instructions to the French naval authorities have been given by the French Government.It is hoped that in so far as restrictions do not already exist on the export to Russia of any goods ofimportance for the prosecution of war His Majesty&apos;governments in the Dominions will be prepared to take similar measures to those being taken here.      We should of course be ready to advise in any case of doubt.

W, T. - SQA^V CYPHER TELEGRAM. &quot;CIRCULAR,To the Governments, of Canada, Commonwealth of Australia,New Zealand and the Union of South Africa,Sent 3oO army  on the 14th April,  1940.Circular D No.  124,  SECRET.My telegram of Circular D No,  123*As immediate action open to us to prevent theacquisition by Germany of deficiency commodities via AsiaticRussia is of limited scope,,      His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom,,  in consultation with French Government,consider that further endeavour should he made at once to overcome the practical difficulties in the way of making any system of control completely effective,  i,e0 s  through some sort of understanding with Japan to ensure her collaboration in the measures to be taken and some kind of understandingalso with the United States,.2. We should thus wish to open negotiations with Japanfor an understanding whereby she would undertake:-(a) to prevent commodities specified by us    as beingthose most needed by Germany for &quot;war purposes from -(l)  leaving Japanese territory or territory at any timeunder Japanese control for any Russian or German destination,whether directly consigned to either of those countries orsent via a third state;(2) being carried to any such destination on any japanese controlled form of transport by sea, land or air.(b) to take measures to restrain Japanese traders,  etc,from taking part in or facilitating transactions likely to lead to the importation of those commodities either toGermany or Russia.

(e) to prevent the use of Japanese or Japanese controlledports for the trans-shipment of such commodities destined for Germany or Russia.3. In returns it is thought that we should have to consent to facilitate the acquisition by Japan of raw materialsor other key commodities which she requires from British orFrench sources up to certain quantities which could be shown to be justified for her domestic requirements judged by herminimum imports during the last five years, less the amountsusually re-exported by her to Germany and Russia,,4,        With a viev to the successful conduct of these negotiations, it is proposed that we should temporarily placesomewhat severe restrictions on the export to Japan of certainkey commodities of which she is known to stand most in need,explaining our action to her on the grounds of military necessity and. domestic needs,.      During our negotiations weshould maintain contact with the French Governments whosenegotiations, it is thought, should be parallel but not joint.Our negotiations would be conducted in London by che Ministerof Economic Warfare in order that political issues extraneousto the economic questions involved should not be introduced.5. Simultaneously, we should propose to makeapproaches (a) to the Chinese Government with a view toarriving at an understanding for the restriction of their exports to Russia under the Sino-Soviet Barter Agreement,and (b) to the Netherlands Government with a view tolimiting the export of tin and rubber from the netherlands east Indies to Vladivostok or to Lair-en,6. With a view to arriving at some sort of complementaryunderstanding with the United States, we should propose toexplain to the Administration what action is intended,  the

reasons for it and why some measure of co-operation by theJapanese is essential to this end.      It, would be made clearthat we have no intention of trying to secure Japaneseco-operation by any deflection from the line which we have takenin regard to Japan&apos;s actions or intentions in China,     Whilethe United States authorities may feel unable to go beyond themaintenance of their present policy of moral embargo on certaingoods normally imported by aggressor nations, it is hoped thatthey would be prepared to acquiesce in our negotiations with japan and, without withdrawing the assistance to our causewhich their embargo policy might represent, to acquiesce inthe limited supply by us of certain key commodities to Japan forthe   special objects described above and to refrain from makingdifficutlies over the interception of United States ships orcargoes bound for Vladivostock or Dairen.7,      In view of the urgency of the matter, details of the scheme outlined above have been communicated to His Majesty&apos;ammbassadors at Tokyo and Washington with a view to obtainingtheir advice as to probable reactions of Japanese and UnitedStates authorities respectively if it is decided to makeofficial approaches on these lines.     As soon as the Ambassadors&apos;views have been received they will of course be communicatedto you at once.      Meanwhile, His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom would be very grateful for an early expression of the preliminary views of His Majesty&apos;s Government inCanada.Commonwealth of australia new Zealand&quot;Union of &quot;South africa and or information whether theCanadianCommonwealthNew ZealandUnionGovernment would be prepared to co-operate in the measures

Extract from message from the PrimekMinisterof the Commonwealth of Australia r;e;eeived Throughthe High Commissioner for the Commonwealth inLondon, on 5th April;/,. 1940.XX X X(4)    Contraband control in the Par East,    I cannotunderstand how we can make a (tankers) contraband controleffective in an ocean area in which one country of immediate (neighbourhood), that is, Japan has a markednaval superiority.     As matter appears to me and to mysenior colleague with whom I have discussed it, this control would tend to be provocative and ineffective inrelation to Japan and the United States of America andmight well turn out to be enforceable only against smallercountries like Netherlands East Indies who are our (friends).Having regard to the enormous transport problem of takinggoods into Russia along trans-Siberian line we are strongly of opinion that contraband steps proposed are likelyto achieve results incomparably smaller than risks whiohthey would create.     Perhaps you have some fullerinformation on these points than has been communicated tous.     But having regard to fact that in despatching.forcesabroad we have increasingly   assumed neutrality of Japan,there would be considerable uneasiness in Australia atadopting of any measures in the Par East which are calculated to bring us into conflict with Japan.
