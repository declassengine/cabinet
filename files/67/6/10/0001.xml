/a0rg)(4o) iio*ad April, 1940.COPY NO.A R     CABINET.Reduction of Volume of British shipping in Mediterranean.Note fry Minister of Shipping^1,     On 18th April, the Cabinet&quot;Invited the Minister of Shipping to consider whether,and if so, what measures should he taken at once toreduce the volume of British shipping passing throughthe Mediterranean, and to report to the War Cabinet&quot;.2*     The following action is actually being taken:-Vessels sailing from Australia or New Zealand to theUnited Kingdom via Suez are from 19th April onwardsto he routed via the Cape, except the fortnightly mailservice from Australia, which will continue via Suezand carry any supplies for the Middle East Force.    Itmay be necessary to send other ships from australia to Egypt in order to carry the whole of these supplies.!Government stores outwards for the Mediterranean will be concentrated in as few vessels as reasonably possibleparticularly in the cases of vessels hound for east of Suez.    Outward tramps in ballast from U.K. for Australia will proceed via the Cape ,   Other outwarcarrangements to remain as at present.-jThe action applies to British vessels or neutrals time-!chartered to us.Overseas Bunker Depots, coal and oil, affected by a diversion, will be stocked up*3.   The next steps which can be taken in order of priority wouldbe:(a) Liners sailing outward to Australia and New Zealandvia Suez to be routed via Gape, except mail steamers.(b) Liners, tramps and tankers proceeding to and from far east, East side of India and East Africa to be routedvia Cape *The loss of time on these voyages would be:At 12 knotsTo and from Par East11      &quot;       11   East side of India&quot;     11       &quot;   West side of Indiaii     it       it   Persian Gulf&quot;      &quot;       &quot;   East Africa12 days14     &quot;16      &quot;16      &quot;9      &quot;At 9 knots16 days18     &quot;22     &quot;22     &quot;12      &quot;-1-

If (a) or (b) were decided upon, a decision would also berequired whether the order should apply only to ships which havenot yet sailed, or to ships en route as well, so far as these arenot in the Mediterranean.Diversion of vessels loading on the west coast of India orin the Persian Gulf would lengthen the voyage by approximately50/ .(c) MediterraneancTramps bound for Mediterranean not to discharge orload East of Tunis unless taking Government stores to egypt, Palestine or Turkey.    This would cut out Italy,Malta, Danube and Egypt, but would allow loading ofore in North Africa.Tankers not to load at Constanza or Haifa except for egypt, or destinations East of Malta.4. British ships and neutral vessels on charter to Ministryof Shipping might be bunkered so that they can be diverted viaCape if necessary without intermediate replenishments.    this action would shut out cargo both outward and homeward.5.    British ships could be warned to avoid Italian ports onsuitable pretexts.6.    Obstacles could be put in the way of Italian ships bound for Italy.7.   Any marked contraction in the volume of tonnage tradingto or in the Eastern Mediterranean would, of course complicate the problem of supplying Malta, Palestine and Egypt and themovement of troops in that area.8.   Any complete diversion which was likely to last more thana week or two would seriously impair the fulfilment of our import programme and would make it necessary to consider at once agreater concentration on the short North Atlantic route and greater shipments of oil from the Gulf of Mexico and the DutchWest Indies.R.S.H.Ministry of Shipping.
