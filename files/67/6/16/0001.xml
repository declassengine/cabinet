Memorandum by the.....Lord Privy1. At their first meeting held on 26th April, 1940, theCommittee on Recruitment for the Armed Forces^ considered a memo-random   by the Minister of Laborer and National Service on theman power available for the Armed Forces and on the scope of thenext Proclamation for the calling up of further age-groups.2. Up to the present, age-groups 20-27 have been made liable for service by Royal Proclamations and the last of ohese age-groups is due for registration on 25th May next.      The points onwhich a decision is now required are as follows.-(l)    The present method of obtaining men for militaryservice is to register successive age-groups and call up those who are not reserved under the schedule of Reserved Occupations.      Should this procedure becontinued up to higher age-groups, or should thepersons in the lower age groups who are protected by the Schedule of Reserved Occupations be combedout, thus deferring for some months the calling upof age-groups from, say, 30 onwards?(2)    Assuming that the existing method Is to continue,should the next Proclamation cover the whole of theremaining age-groups covered by the National Service(Armed Forces) Act (i.e* the age-groups 28-40, in-clusive and 18-19)%    or should it be limited to coversay the age-groups 28-36 inclusive?$   The composition and terms of reference of the Committare given in Annex II of this paper.4-   R.Fo(40)2 issued as Annex I to this Paper.SECRET.WJ?o(G)(40)  116.,   30th APRIL,  1940.

3. As regards the first point, the Committee consideredthat it would he wrong at this stage to withdraw trained menfrom industry for enlistment in the Forces so long as thereare    still men in the higher age-groups not reserved for industry by the Schedule of Reserved Occupations.      they therefore recommend that the present method of registeringand calling-up successive age-groups should be continued,4. As regards the second point,  the Minister of Labourand   National Service wishes the Proclamation to cover atleast eight age-groups,  in order    that he may be in aposition to meet any unexpected extra demands from the Armyduring the calendar year without having recourse to a freshProclamation-     \/e agree that a Proclamation registering andcalling up the next eight age-groups is necessary.5, The question whether it is desirable to go further and    to include in the Proclamation the age-groups of 18 and19, and the age-groups up to and including 40, turns mainly on psychological and political grounds0      Such a Proclamationmight be regarded as an earnest of our determination and as likely   to have a good effect in Allied and neutral countries.Further, it would give the men in the later age-groups, andtheir employers, long notice of their liabilities.      On theother hand,  to proclaim age-groups over 36 might cause ameasure of unsettlement which is unnecessary and is bestavioded, more especially seeing that the older men are unlikely to be called up for at least another 12 months.There    is the further consideration that a Proclamationcovering men aged up to 40 might have repercussions on theSchedule of Reserved Occupations,  and might lead to a demand that the younger men protected by the Schedule should becombed out.     This would be unfortunate from the point ofview of our war effort,     We therefore favour the view thatthe next Proclamation should cover men aged up to 36inclusive, but not men above that age0

6c     Two points of detail arise:-(i)    The oldest age-group already proclaimed isthe group born in 1912 (described nsthe 27 age-group).      If it is now decidedto call up the next eight age-groups, thatiss  those born in the years 1911-1004(both inclusive), it will be necessary to proclaim the age-groups 28-36, since the proclamation   tahes effect from the dateof signature, and on the date of thenext Proclamation - nearly half those born in 1904 would be 36 years of age.(ii)    In order to ensure the steady call up ofmen as they reach the age of 20, it willbe necessary to proclaim the 19 age-groupfor registration purposes only.7*      In discussion of this matter the view was advancedthat, having regard to the immense importance in our war effort of the proper allocation of man-power, it wouldbe desirable as a preliminary to a review of the whole position, that statistical discussions should be initiated forthwith between the Departments concerned.Steps are being taken accordingly,,8.     The Committee Vs main recomrnenclation is &quot;thus thatthe next Proclamation should cover the next eightage-groups, that is,  the men born in the years1911-1904 (both inclusive)*      These age-groups would normally be described as groups 28 to 35.(Initialled)    K.W.Richmond Terrace, S*W.jae

MAN-POWER AVAILABLE FOR THE ARMED FORCES.Memorandum, &quot;by the Minister of Labourand National Service.1. I circulate this memorandum in order that mycolleagues may be enabled to take stock of the position regarding the man-power available for the Armed Forces.2. The procedure is for age groups within the limits18-41 laid down in the National Service (Armed Forces) Actto be made liable for service by Royal proclamations.    Themen in specified age groups are then required to registeron prescribed days and are, in due course, medically examined and called up for service.      Up to the present,the age groups 20-27 inclusive have been made liable for service.      The age groups 20-27 inclusive have been registered (the age group 25 on 6th April).      The age-group 26 is to be registered on 27th April, and the age group. 27 on 25th May.3..      The position as regards the six age groups 20-25inclusive already registered can be given with sufficientaccuracy as follows:-Estimated total male population 2,156,000(age groups 20-25 inclusive)Classes not registered:-Men already in the Armed .... 436,000ForcesOthers not required to    ......  120,000 556,000register and menfailing to registerTotal number registered ,,.,      , ,    . . ,      1,60C,OoO/3R.F.

Reserved under Schedule of reserved Occupations orotherwise 490,000Voluntary enlistment intothe Armed Forces afterregistration 60,000Conscientious Objectors              50,000 580,000Balance             ...    .....    .... . 1,020,000Medically graded III and IV ...    .... 155.000Available for calling up.(medically graded I and II)...... 885,000Available for posting to theForces only as Service tradesmen ..... 255,000Available for posting to theForces for general service 650,000The 235,000 men available for posting to the Forces only as Service Tradesmen form a pool from which recruits arcdrawn as and when required to meet the demands of theForces for tradesmen over a long period..      The supply ofmen available for general service is thus the determining factor in deciding the frequency with which further age groups have to be registered and called up.4. The age groups 20-25 have therefore yielded thefollowing men (medically graded I and II) for service in the Forces:-Men already in the Forces before theirage groups were required to register 436,000Men who have voluntarily enlisted afterregistration but before date of calling up 60,000Men available for posting or alreadyposted under the compulsory recruitments cheme -(a) as Service tradesmen only 255,000(b) for general service 650,0001.581,0005. Some deductions from the number of 650,000 given as available for general service have to&apos;be made owing topostponements on account of hardship and other miscellaneouscauses amounting, in total, to 50,000,      For the most partthese deductions are, however, temporary,      On the otherhand it has to be borne in mind that, although the

the Forces have, up to the present, taken only men in medical Grades I and II the Army and Air Force will shortlyhe talcing a limited number of Grade III men.6, There are still 17 age groups remaining to be registered.      Two of these age groups will, however, consistof persons aged 18 and 19,  and it will be recalled that anundertaking was given in Parliament by the Secretary of Statefor War that men would not be called up for service until they had reached the age of 20 unless this was consideredimperative in the national interest.      In the following paragraphs, therefore, separate figures are given for theage groups 18 and 19.      Men reaching the age of 20 become available for service and are thereupon registered!    thefigures relating to them ere included in the figures forthe remaining higher age groups 26-40 inclusive.      Acorresponding deduction has been made from the 40 age group to exclude those men who will have reached the age of 41before they can be called up for service.-7. For the age groups 26-40 (including the men reaching the age of 20 but excluding the men reaching the age of 41),the position is approximately as follows, though there is necessarily a considerable margin of error in the figures:-Estimated total male population(age groups 26-40 inclusive)    ...    ... 5,574,000Glasses not registered:-Men already in the Armed Forces    720,000Others not required to registerand men falling to register 500,000    1,020,000Expected registrations      ...    ...... 4,554,000Reserved under Schedule of reserved Occupations orotherwise 2,768,000Conscientious Objectors 86,000    2,854,000Balance ...     ...      ... 1,700,000Medically graded III and IV ... 550,000

For the age groups 18 and 19 the corresponding figures are estimated as follows:-.Estimated total male population(age groups 18 and 19)       ,..     ... 800,000Classes not registered:-Men already in the Armed Forces       100,000Others not required to registerand men failing to register 4-0,000    140,000Expected registrations 660,000Reserved under Schedule of reserved Occupations orotherwise 60,000Conscientious Objectors 10,000     70,000Balance ...    ...    ...... 590,000Medically graded III and IV       ... 60,000Available for calling up i.e.,medically graded I and II(including voluntary enlistmentsafter registration)        ...    ....... 550,000Available for posting to theForces only as Service tradesmen 150,000Available for posting to the -Forces for&quot; general&quot; service ...... .380,000

total male population is 7,730,000.      Of these 3,258,000are reserved by the Schedule of Reserved Occupations orotherwise.      In addition, 1,022,000 are not availablefor the Forces for various reasons?     The net result isthat these age groups are estimated to yield a total of3,450,000 men medically graded I and II for service in theForces made up as followsMen already in the Forces before they are due to be called up under the 1,215,000compulsory recruitment scheme.Men available for posting or alreadyposted under the compulsory recruitmentscheme:(a) as Service tradesmen only 355,000(b) for general service 1,880,0003,450,000Some 300,000 men in the 20-25 age groups have already beenposted and it is expected that about   70,000 men in the26-40 age groups will volunteer.      This leaves, therefore,1,510,000 men available for posting for general service from the 20-40 age groups.     At any one time from 50,000to 75,000 of these will not be immediately available owingto temporary postponement on hardship and other grounds.10. The intake into the Armed Forces must depend on the size of the Forces to be raised and maintained, and this must depend on the man power and other resources needed tomaintain a Navy, Army and Air Force of a given magnitude.It is important to note that the larger the Forces,particularly in this age of mechanised Armies, the greaterK These include blind men and cripples, men medicallygraded III and IV (some of the Grade III men will, however,be called upon for service in the Army), men exempt underthe National Service (Armed Fcrces) Act (Ministers of religion, Dominion Nationals, etc), Conscientious Objectors,men abroad, vagrants and. defaulters.-8-

is the number of men required to equip and munition them.We are ultimately driven hack on the problem of the properallocation of the man power of the nation.     This9 however9would go beyond the scope of the present paper 9 but I maypoint out that provision of man power for the maintenanceof supplies for the Forces9 for the export trades and forthe civilian population is made to the extent of 392582000men in the age groups 20-40 who are reserved under theSchedule of Reserved Occupations (see paragraph 9 above)in addition to the men below and above military age andthe women who can be employed in industry.11. From the narrower standpoint of recruitment tothe Forces the rate of intake must depend on the prevailingmilitary situation and the general progress of the war.Since the outbreak of war the average intake into theForces under the National Service (Armed Forces) Acthas been approximately 509000 men per month.      This figureparticularly in regard to Army demands has9 however9recently shown a tendency to increase and the. Navy and theAir Force have only recently begun to absorb men regularly.If serious fighting develops it is possible that about70s000 men will be required under the compulsory recruitmentscheme each month for general service in the Navy. Ar-nyand Air Force.      If * however, there is no serious fightingsthe monthly figure may be as low as 459000 for several months.12. For the purpose of deciding whether the presentproportions of recruitment out of total man power are sufficient we nOed only consider the position which will arise if the monthly intake of men for general service isat the estimated maximum of 7090009 since this is the mostunfavourable assumption from this point of view.

On this basis the estimated supply of about1-g- million men for general service would cover a periodof some 20 months i.e. till the end of the year 1941.There are^-- however 9 a number of uncertain factors s inparticular the effect of the Schedule of reserved occupations and the medical fitness of the later groups;moreover if the Services continue to find it necessary as in the past to call on Grade I men at    a fasterrate than Grade II men, this will accelerate exhaustion of the classes.      For these reasons I do not think thatwith a monthly intake of 70?000 for general servicewe can safely place the exhaustion date later than theearly summer of 1941.13. The further sources which will be available arethe 18 and 19 age groupss the age groups over 40 (forwhich further legislation would be required), and the menat present reserved by the Schedule of Reserved Occupations.14. The immediate question is9 however  whether we sheuTdshortly look to classes of men at present reserved by theSchedule so as to defer for some months the calling upof the. age groups in the late thirties. &apos;-rr15. My judgment of the situation is that it is ofthe first importance at the present time to give industryevery assistance in increasing the output of war materialmeeting the needs of the primary industries, i. e.agriculture and the mines, and in supplying the export markets and meeting necessary home needs pending thetraining of further hands.     We should9 I think, be making an error in withdrawing trained men from work ofnational importance in order to enlist them in the Forcessso long as there are still men in the higher age groups not

reserved for industry.      The Schedule of reserved occupations is under constant review and is amended fromtime to time to meet the changing needs of the Forces andof industry.      I might add that my Department is undertaking a regular review of the individual men classified asreserveds in order to ensure that men are not treated asreserved unless they continue to follow a reservedoccupation.16. I accordingly recommend that we should watch events and in the meantime continue to call up men in the successiveage groups on the present plan.17. The 27 age group which is the last covered by theRoyal Proclamation of the 1st January will5 as stated inparagraph 2 above, be registered in 25th May.      A furtherProclamation at the end of May or the beginning of Junewill accordingly be necessary in order to render furtherage groups liable for service.     This further Proclamationshould cover at least the eight age-groups 28-35 inclusive.The alternative to be considered is that of proclaiming thewhole of the remaining age-groups 28-40 and 18-19 (witha suitable explanation of the special position of the 18-19age groups).      In favour of this alternative it may be saidthat it would be an earnest of determination and would give to later age groups (and their employers) long notice oftheir liabilities:    on the other hand it may be thoughtthat in the case of the age groups over 35 unnecessary and undesirable and unsetblementwould be caused by proclaimingthis now,      I should be glad to know the viev/s of mycolleagues on this point,(Intd), E.B.Ministry of Labour and National Service0ii
