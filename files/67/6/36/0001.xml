military. ^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRETWP (G) (40) 136 Copy No.^24th May, 1940,WAR   CABINETACTION TO BE TAKEN BY THE B.B.C. IN THEEVENT OF AN AIR RAID ON THIS COUNTRY.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.1. The present instructions to the B.B.C. are laid down in C.I.D. PaperNo, 1584/B dated August 4th 1939.     Briefly, the arrangements provide:(a) that on the instructions of Fighter Command Headquarters given direct to the B.B.C., the B.B.C., may be required temporarily to close down allthe existing transmitters in this country, with the exception of thosecarrying the Overseas Service on short wave-lengths;(b) that when all transmitters are thus closed down they may not be re-opened until Fighter Command Headquarters give permission direct to theB.B.C., except on receipt of instructions on the direct line from theCentral War Room to the B.B.C., to re-open for short periods in order to broadcast announcements of special importance.(c) By decision of the Cabinet these broadcasting periods must not belonger than 2 minutes each and must occur irregularly at intervals of notless than half an hour, the first such period to be at least half an hourafter the initial order to close down.2.     The B.B.C. Security Measures Committee, which is a reconstitution of&quot;Document C&quot; Sub-Committee of the C.I.D. and includes representatives of theMinistry of Information, Air Ministry, War Office, Home Security, cabinet offices and B.B.C., met recently to consider the modification of these instructions in the light of: -(a) The War Cabinet decision that the C.in C., Home Forces should beauthorised to instruct the B.B.C. to broadcast instructions to troops inthe event of parachutists landing in this country,    (War Cabinet 120thMeeting, 13th May, Item 3).(b) The fact that it is no longer intended that operational orders shouldbe issued from the Central War Room.3.     The Committee recommend that with the single exception of the C.in C.Home Forces, the arrangements approved by the Civil Defence Committee lastweek should be strictly adhered to, even in time of an emergency such as an air raid.     These arrangements were that all official broadcast announcementswere to be communicated to the B.B.C. by the Ministry of Information onbehalf of the Government Department from which they originate, and the B.B.C.are under strict instructions to accpt no commiinication whatever for announce-ment from any other Government Department except the Ministry.This means that if in a time of emergency the Prime Minister or anyother member of the Wax Cabinet should wish to give instructions to the B.B.C,to issue an announcement, that announcement should be conveyed through theMinistry of Information and not direct.
4.        I ask the War Cabinet to confirm this recommendation and to give me the authority at my discretion to instruct the B.B.C. to re-open trans-mitters for short periods as envisaged in 1 (b), provided the conditions   Cj,Tinder 1 (c) are observed.5.        The Committee also considered the risks of enemy interference with a.B.C broadcasts and I am circulating separately their report in&apos;full forthe information of the War Cabinet. .D. C.
