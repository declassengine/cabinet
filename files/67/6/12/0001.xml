I have recently had prepared in the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare a full report on the operation of theEnemy Exports control which was instituted by the&quot;Reprisals&quot; Order in Council of the 27th November,  1939-The report is long and I do not wish to trouble the WarCabinet with it.      But in view of the importance of enemy Exports control both for the success of the blockade and from the point of view of our relations with neutrals,I think that it may be useful to circulate for the in-formation of the War Cabinet the present note summarising the main points which arise from the report referred toabove.Prom the strictly legal point of view,  the operationof the control has given rise to little difficulty.      Inthis respect the control of Enemy Exports presents fewerproblems than that of Contraband, where the evidence of possible enemy destination is often conflicting and calls for a considerable amount of judicial appreciation.      Thequestion whether any goods are or are not enemy exports is usually a comparatively simple question of fact, thoughmore difficulty is likely to be experienced - for example -over goods produced in neutral countries out of materialsupplied from Germany or goods in regard to which there isan enemy interest.The main question in regard to the interpretation of the Order-in-Council that has emerged from the cases that have come before Lord Justiae du Parcq&apos;s Committee sofar is whether our control should apply to goods consignedby enemy-controlled firms in neutral countries.as well asto goods originating from onomy territory.This is a very complicated and technical question.The position is briefly as follows:It/

It is clear that the Reprisals Order-in-Councilgives legal powers to place in Prize goods which are enemy property hut not of enemy origin..    At the same timesome doubt has been felt as to how far His Majesty&apos;sGovernment intended that action should be taken against these goods.      In view of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the House of Commons on the 28th November that the purposeof the Reprisals Order-in-Council was to stop German exports,the Ministry of Economic Warfare and the Enemy ExportsCommittee have not felt that they ought to interfere withgoods of enemy ownership, but not origin, unless these wereclosely allied with,  and in some sense analogous to, exports from enemy territory,  i.e. were exported by an enemy person or firm from a European country.      The resulting positionis that all goods of enemy ownership exported from Europe,even though not of enemy origin, have been regarded assubject to interference, but that enemy-owned goodsproceeding to Europe (and not being contraband going toGermany) have been left alone, as also have enemy-ownedgoods passing between two countries outside Europe, e.g.between South and North America.Prom the general standpoint of economic warfare itwould be desirable to be able to discharge and place inPrize enemy-owned goods passing between neutral countries.Many German-owned firms located, for example,  in the dutch east Indies and in South America, export on a considerable scale to neutral countries.     This traffic produces foreign exchange which is doubtless placed at Germany&apos;s disposal.There is also considerable evidence of Germans,  for instance in South America, buying through the clearing local produce and selling it for free currency in another neutral country -in this way, converting credit in a clearing, which hasstrictly limited uses, into far more valuable free foreign exchange/

It is clear, therefore,  that in the general interestof tightening our blockade it would he useful to extend the interpretation of the Reprisals Order-in-Council tocover enemy-owned goods moving inwards to Europe or between countries outside Europe.      In present circumstanceshowever, wholly successful results cannot be anticipatedfrom the adoption of this policy for the following reasons(i) There are practical difficulties in extending theoperation of the Order-in-Council in this sense to inter-American trade (there would of course be no physicaldifficulty as regards trade moving to Europe);(ii) It is doubtful whether,  in the case of animportant commodity like rubber produce, a clear case of enemy ownership could be satisfactorily established.(iii) In any case,  the goods would probably be sold to a neutral owner before shipment and there would inevitably be difficulty in distinguishing between genuine andfictitious sales to neutral firms;(iv) It would be necessary to exclude goods not onthe contraband list destined for Europe.      These are notnumerous but include one important item,  tobacco.      Theycannot be included because it has been agreed that theReprisals Order-in-Council should not be used to extend the Contraband List indirectly.      But if,  say, German-ownedtobacco destined for Germany cannot be stopped,  it wouldbe highly anomalous to stop German-owned tobacco destined for a neutral.It follows that this policy,  if adopted,  can at present only be put into partial application.      This course is opento objection.      It means that we will incur the odium withthe neutral countries concerned of extending our measures ofreprisal without ourselves securing the full results of suchaction; and in particular it may have serious repercussions on/

-k-on the working of our War Trade Agreement with, theNetherlands Government.In agreement with, the Foreign Secretary and the attorney-General,  I propose to continue the present policy whereby all goods of enemy ownership that can fairly be regarded as analogous to an enemy export, even though not of enemy origin, are subjected to export control,  andthat this should be regarded as covering not only goodsmoving from Europe overseas but goods moving between twoneutral countries in Europe.      I propose for the presentnot to extend this policy so as to cover (a) enemy ownedgoods on the contraband list coming from overseas anddestined for neutral countries in Europe,  or (b) to enemy-owned goods of any kind moving between two countries overseas.I should like, however,  to reserve the right to bring this question before the Cabinet again at a later stage ifit seems advisable and practicable to take further actionin these cases.While this is the only point of importance which has arisen as regards the    interpretation of the Order-in-council the administration of the Order and the treatment of claims for exemption have raised a great many difficulties.      HisMajesty4a Government stated at the outset that the Order-in-Council would be applied leniently so as to take accountof neutral interests; and very large numbers of applicationsfor exemption have been submitted to the Committee forconsideration.     The Committee has gone very carefully into these applications and has worked out a series of conditionsthat would justify favourable consideration of special cases.The principal one,  of course,  is that of goods which were both ordered and paid for by neutral purchasers before thedate of the Order-in-Council, but which were shipped after that/

that date.  On the basis of these eases the Committee has beenable to establish a certain number of principles which guideit in the administration of the Order-in-Council.These principles are constantly under review by theCommittee.    For example,  discussions have been taking place with the United States State Department which has pressed forthis exemption of all goods ordered before the date of theOrder-in-Council if payment was effected before the 31stDecember last and. some concession may have to be made to meetbona fide cases of hardship.Unfortunately,  however, many of the applications for exemption have been put forward - on grounds which the Committeewould not normally accept - by neutral Governments or by commercial interests in neutral countries which it is difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to ignore.    The most important of these cases are:--(1)     Various cargoes of machinery and industrial equipment consigned tn Japan.The Cabinet agreed to release two Japanese ships sailing atthe end of December on the understanding that from 1st january the Order-in-Council would be strictly enforced.    The JapaneseGovernment was so informed: but in fact it proved necessary to exempt two further ships with similar cargoes in February.Soon afterwards the Japanese Government asked for exemption for a very large quantity of goods, the approximatevalue of which was stated to be some  13,250,000 and which weresaid to have been already ordered, by the Japanese government itself or by Japanese industries.    Detailed applications were submitted for a large consignment of German dyestuffs weighingnearly 180 tons,  described as IOC;&quot; of German origin andadmittedly not paid for.    Subsequently the Japanese Governmentamended their proposals to ask that they should have exemption for eight more ships carrying all their German export/requirements

requirements,  including those mentioned above,  on theunderstanding that they would not ask for any furtherexemption from the Reprisals Order in Council during the   restof the war.    It is clear that exemption on such a scalecould not be granted in favour- of Japan without making theposition of His Ma jesty&apos; s/Covc-rnment vis-a-vis\ other.&apos;neutrals extremely difficult.(2)      Armaments for Iran ana Afghanistan.Exemption has been granted in respect of a very large quantityof war material ordered by the Iranian Government and ofmachinery and other goods for the Government of Afghanistan;,although they have not been pail for, purely on political grounds.       The Government of Iran is now pressing stronglyfor exemption to be granted also for civil goods of an even greater value than the military stores.(3)     Exports liy a neutral country to its Colonies.A number of cases of goods consigned Toy neutral governments to their overseas colonial administrations have come beforethe Ministry of Economic Warfare.    Exports by the ItalianGovernment to its overseas Empire are by special agreementallowed to pass without interference on the declaration thatthese exports are Government property,  on the understandingthat the proportion of goods of German origin among suchshipments is kept as low as possible.      In the case of goodssent to their colonies by the Belgian and NetherlandsGovernments,  the Ministry of Economic Warfare asks forapplications for exemption to be sent through diplomatic channels with details of origin etc.    So far the netherlands government has refused, to comply with this procedure and hasmerely notified us that goods of such and such an origin havebeen shipped.    Up to the present we have maintained ourprinciple vis-a-vis the Netherlands Government by occasionallyplacing In prize token consignments of goods of declaredGerman origin. ,   ,

(U)   Exports consigned..jtq^gther^neutrjil Governments.In other cases, e.g.  consignments of machinery rolling stock etc.  from Germany to various Governments particularlyin South America exemption has &quot;been asked for on the groundthat the goods are necessary for the economic developmentof the countries concerned and that they could not he obtainedelsewhere.    Host of these claims have been refused,  exemptionbeing granted only in cases of particular hardships and provided that the major part of the payment has already beenmade.(5)    Exports paid for in blocked marks.The United States Government has asked for exemption of all goods that are paid for in blocked marks.    In principle,   it isdifficult to contest the reasonableness of such a claim,provided that the goods are paid for in marks which were owned by the neutral importer before the outbreak of war; but inpractice it is extremely difficult,  if not impossible,  to admitexemption on this ground without opening a very wide door forthe continuance of German exports.    Many countries have Clearingarrangements with Germany on which they have favourable balances;and,  if they were allowed to use these balances,  the German .export trade would continue with almost undiminished vigour fora very long period.    Moreover,  it would be very easy for theGermans, by collusion,  to put blocked marks at the disposal ofthe purchaser,  which he could use for further exports fromGermany,  against payment of the counter value to an account ofthe German Government   in some neutral country/.      discussions are still proceeding with the United States of America and itmay be possible to exempt some individual ca-ses where theevidence is water-tight, but it would be impossible to admit anygeneral exemption under this head.Finally,  I should add a word of warning as to the/actual

actual efficiency of our control and in particular as regardsenemy SKpcrtSiaa shipped via Italy.    The Certificate of Originsystem is the &quot;basis of control of enemy exports and it is .essential for this purpose that our Consuls should he providedby the exportgaSwith all the evidence required to establishthat the goods to be exported, are in fact of neutral originand that there is no enemy interest involved.    Moreover, theyshould have freedom to refuse a Certificate of Origin when theyare not satisfied as to the genuine neutral nature of the goods.These conditions do not prevail in Italy where the responsibilityis to some degree delegated to the Provincial Councils and ourConsuls are not..in a position to obtain the necessary evidence.As a result, the large majority of the reports of evasion ofour control refer to shipments from Italy,  and. there is nodoubt that the evasion through this channel is considerable.It will be seen that Lord Justice du ?arcq!s Committeehas no easy task in dealing with these administrativequestions;  and I hope that the action taken by the Committeewill be approved by the Cabinet.    If, however, we are not tobe faced with accusations of applying our control to countriesor interests which are not strong enough to resist us, whilerelaxing it in favour of those who are able to create trouble,every effort should be made to tighten up the control,  and asfar as possible to avoid any further extension of exemptionon purely political grounds.April 27th.  19u1-R.H.C.
