Sr.-Memorandum by the Minister of Information?I have discussed with the Chairman and Direetor-General of theB.B.C what degree of oontrol can appropriately be exercised by theMinistry of Information over the B.B.C,    The B.B.C. have acceptedhitherto and will continue to accept general guidance from this ministry and will bow to our decisions after having made their observations.   Weare now providing fuller and more &quot;authoritative guidance.   Sir AllanPowell and Mr. Ogilvie said they would gladly aooept any directionswhether general or particular on all matters which the Ministerconsidered to be in the national interest.    They have agreed that nobroadcasts of political importance will be arranged without my approval,and the existing liaison between the Ministry and the B,B.C, will be developed so that a greater degree of control can in future be exercised.Mr. Ryan, Controller of B.B.C&apos;s Home Division is going to attend our policy meetings every morning and Mr. Ogilvie will attend twice a week atthe meetings at which I am present.   The director of our BroadcastingDivision, Mr, Wellington, will attend analogous meetings at the B.B.C,It has been arranged, in agreement with the other GovernmentDepartments concerned, and with the approval of the Civil DefenceCommittee, that the B.B.C. will publish no official announcements except those received from the Ministry (apart from instructions received from the,-in-C,, Home Forces, in the form of operational orders in the event ofparachute attack - see War Cabinet Minutes of 15th May (120th Meeting)item 3)*     I am reporting separately to the Cabinet on these and othersecurity measures in the event of air attack in this country (W,P, (G) (kO)136),     These arrangements came into force on the morning of Saturday,18th May, and should preclude a repetition of the hoax message which was sent out on May 13th.   I have also made arrangements to provide BroadcastingHouse with an armed guard, and have requested the Secretary of State forWar to provide anti-aircraft defence for broadcasting stations in thiscountry - a most urgently needed precaution, which I hope he will be ableto provide with the least possible delay.I intend tS make a practice of broadcasting myself fairlyfrequently, in order to comment upon and explain the news,I would also urge my colleagues to make use of the radio.   this applies to all Ministers who have any communication to make to the public,but especially to those in charge of Service Departments,   The public area. *jCopy Ho.SECRET&apos;&quot;M u nap i*&apos;iMW.P.

Thenemy have not neglected their opportunities in this field.   It would tmuch to the national advantage if Service Ministers recognizing this ndevelopment of broadcasting as an important element of warfare wouldinstruct their Departments to exploit its possibilities to the full inco-operation with the Ministry and B.B.C.Initialled   D.
