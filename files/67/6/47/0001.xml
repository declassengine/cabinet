1 QQi. (j cJThe present policy is to restrict all unnecessary travel and inparticular to limit travel from Ireland to Great Britain to persons whodesire to corns here on work of national importance0In.applying this policy difficulty has been experienced in deciding what measures of security should be adopted in dealing with the large volume of Irish labour which is required for agriculture and other industries.The really urgent problem is the question whether facilities should begiven to enable agricultural workers to come to this country from Eire, Atthe moment there are sons one thousand Eire citizens waiting outside the offices of the United Kingdom Permit Office which has been set up in Dublinwith through tickets booked for them by their prospective employers. Manyof these people are penniless and unless some decision is reached forthwithit is feared that these disappointed Irish citizens may cause disorder withadverse effect on the maintenance of good relations between the two countries.There is an acute shortage in this country atJ this moment of workers for lifting the potato crop in Scotland,     Hitherto most of the workers havebeen imported from Eire, and this is the only satisfactory source of supply,since the accommodation available for persons engaged in potato-lifting inScotland is of a very primitive character and non-Irish labour would not tolerate the conditions obtaining?     Apart from political difficulties whichmight be caused by the compulsory employment of refugees in this class ofwork, the farmers themselves have a prejudice against the employment of alienlabour, and in present circumstances there is little likelihood of themilitary authorities agreeing to allow soldiers to be employed for thispurpose.The Department of Agriculture for Scotland represent strongly that some decision must be taken immediately since if Irish labour is not available thereis every likelihood that a considerable part of the early potato crop inScotland will be lost.On the other hand, the Security Services represent strongly that in thepresent time of crisis and in view of the danger of invasion, it is most undesirable that any special facilities should be given to large bodies ofIrishmen to come to this country, since there is a risk that such personsmay be used as semi-combatants to assist an enemy invader^     It is urgedthat no machinery vcan be devised to provide an adequate safeguard againstdangerous persons coming here since it Is impossible to obtain and maintain an adequate check on persons who are brought to this country in largenumbers.     The Security Services also represent that if the imported Irishlabour was in fact trustworthy and not of a semi-combatant oharacter thereis every likelihood that in the event of invasion there would be an immediateexodus of these people back in Ireland; so that their services would be lest.Supply of Irish. Labour&apos;Report by the Overseas Travel Committee.

The question to be decided is whether the importance of obtaining a supply of agricultural labourers, not only for the potato harvest inScotland, but for harvesting operations generally in Great Britain asa whole, outweighs the risks from the security point of view of theinflux of a large number of unvetted persons from Eire.If, as a matter of policy, it were decided that the national interests required that the supply of labour from Eire should notbe discontinued, the Overseas Travel Committee suggest that a scheme on the following lines should be brought into operation forthwith1*   So far as the potato-lifting industry in Scotland is concemoipit is suggested that the persons interested in the harvesting of the crop (who are for the most part potato merchants and have a representativeAssociation) should send over agents to Eublin for the purpose of recruiting workers from Eireo     It would be necessary for the agents toarrange for the persons so recruited to be supplied with an Eire TravelPermit Card which bears on it the photograph of the holder and thecost of which is 5/-o2. Persons so recruited and supplied with a Travel Permit Cardwould then apply to the United Kingdom Permit Office in Dublin for avisa.3.   The United Kingdom Permit Office would grant a visa to any suchapplicant provided that his name was not on the suspect list, and wouldmark the visa in a manner to indicate that the holder was proceeding to Great Britain for agricultural work exclusively04.   The agents sent to Eire would arrange for the personsrecruited to come in groups? and they would give an undertaking thatthese groups would be kept together at or in the neighbourhood of the farms where they would be employe do5.    On the arrival of such workers in this country it would ofcourse be the responsibility of the employer to see that unemploymentbooks were obtained for theme     These books would be marked with lettersindicating that the holders would be engaged in the agricultural industry, and in accordance with the Order recently made under theEnergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1940, they would be unable to takeemployment in this country other than agricultural employment withoutthe permission of an Employment Exchange .6.   As regards persons from Eire who desire to come to this countryfor agricultural work not in organised bodies but as individuals, itis proposed that a visa should not be issued to them unless they are inpossession of an Eire Travel Permit Card and produce concrete evidencethat they have a definite offer of employment from a farmer in thiscountry.     Where the United Kingdom Permit Office in Eire has any doubt as to the bona fides either of the individual or of the offer ofemployment, reference would be made to London for the necessary enquiriesto be mades7. It is proposed that a visa should not be given to any person in Eire unless he is recruited by agents of the agricultural industry as a member of an organised gang or unless he can produce satisfactory

O.F.15th June * 1940sevidence that he has a definite offer of employment from a farmer inthis country.8*   In order to provide an effective sanction for the carrying outof these Orders it would he necessary to amend the new Defence Regulatio--under which leave to land from Ireland may he refused so as to enableconditions to he attached to the leave to land in this country*It cannot he claimed that a scheme on these lines will remove allrisk of dangerous persons coming to this countacy in the guise ofagricultural or farm workers, hut the Committee have been unable tosugge st any other means of enabling a supply of workers from Eire to bemaintained if it is decided as a matter of policy that recruitment oflabour from Eire cannot be discontinued in the interests of national food supply in time of war.     It is estimated that in a normal year the numberof seasonal agricultural workers coming to this country from Eire is ofthe order of ten thousand, consisting Of men, women and young persons ofboth sexes who may remain in this country for periods up to six months-
