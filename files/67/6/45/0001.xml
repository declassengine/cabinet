C3&quot;    L**-r *(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS . BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.)      .fQrCopy No,^SECRETWP (G) (40) 14-5June 11th.WAR CABINETCOMPULSORY CENSORSHIPMemorandum by the Minister of Information.4 e&quot;*)NATURE OP THE PROBLEM.It has been suggested that a scheme should be designed to ensurethat nothing shall be published in the Press of this country which dealswith military matters until after it has been passed by the Censor.     this cannot be ensured under the existing Censorship system.The problem of preventing the publication of uncensored informationof value to the enemy is not in fact confined to military information inany recognized sense.     Under modern conditions it ought to be faced thatthere is little that occurs in this country, including trade, technical andindustrial information of all kinds, knowledge of which is not useful toGermany.     To take one example, current weather conditions, information asto which permeates all sorts of local and sporting news, are a militarysubject from the point of view of the Air Ministry.     It is obvious,therefore, that the net ought to be cast very wide.It is the earnest wish of the authorities in Prance that some form of compulsory Censorship should be introduced into this country.Probably it is not fully appreciated in Prance that, even with compulsoryCensorship in this country, the treatment of censorable news in the twocountries would continue to show substantial divergence owing to thedifferent public reactions to be considered,SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM.(a) There are 11 London daily papers, of which the three eveningpapers produce different editions throughout the day.(b) There are 133 Provincial daily papers, of which only about 10have London offices,(o) There are nearly 760 London, Provincial and suburban weekly-newspapers in Great Britain and Northern   Ireland,(d) There is also a very large number of weekly or monthly periodicals,each of which may at any moment publish some information of value.These run into several hundreds;   or many thousands, if publicationssuch as parish magazines are included.THE PRESENT SYSTEM.The system which has been in operation since the beginning of theWar depends on voluntary submission by newspapers to the   Censorship of any matter which they intend to publish on War subjects.     Such matter iscensored by a body of Censors in London (representing a total strength of50/6O).     By this means comparatively effective Censorship is exercised over the following:-(a^ The London dailies and Sunday papers.lb) The big Provincial papers with London offices,(c) The important News   Agencies, who distribute the news in thecountry from London.

- 2 -Only a modicum of submissions is received from the ordinaryProvincial Press,     This is largely due to the length of time involved in sending matter up to and receiving it back from London in time to go toPress,     Much War news is therefore printed in the country without submission.But this has not resulted in serious defects of security for the following reasons(a) Provincial dailies take the great bulk of their War news fromAgency news which has already been censored in London;   while the&apos;weeklies1 news is generally out of date,(b) All the papers have Defence Notices and frequent instructions from the Censorship to guide them, which they are genuinely anxiousto give effect to.     In fact, the Provincial Editor generally errson the side of caution,(c) Certain big syndicates controlling Provincial papers get theirsyndicated news censored in London, e,g. Allied Newspapers, North-cliff e   Newspapers, Westminster Press,WHAS THE PRESENT SYSTEM ACHIEVES.The fundamental weakness of the present system is that there isno effective sanction at all for breaches of Censorship Regulations.Submission to Censorship is voluntary;   it is no offence to ignore thecensoring of matter, even if submitted;   and the only relevant offencewhich has been created by the Defence   Regulations is the offence of publishing information which would be likely to be useful to the enemy inconnection with the War, (Defence Regulation 3).     Since this is the only thing which is forbidden, and since the offence is hedged about with aproviso that the offender may show that the publication was not &quot;likelyto prejudice the defence of the realm or the efficient prosecution of theWar&quot;, the Censors&apos; function hitherto has been confined, on the instructions of the Government, to stopping matter which, if published, would be an offence under this Regulation.     A good deal of matter has therefore to be passed by the Censorship on military subjects, which it may well be undesirable to publish, but which the newspaper editor concerned, ifchallenged, could easily show to have been available to the enemy authorities from other sources than this paper.     An example of this is the passage inthe &quot;Evening Standard&apos;s&quot; article on the vulnerability of the birmingham and Liverpool ^waterworks.     This was passed by the Military Adviser to the censorship on the ground that it contained nothing that the Germans did notobviously know already.     Moreover, the Censorship is quite without rightor power to require that matter is not to be published on any such general grounds as that it is inaccurate, or exaggerated, or misleading, or injurious to public morale.     Since the Y/ar began there has never been a prosecution of a newspaper under Defence Regulation 3.     It has been allowed to become a dead letter.     This has happened in spite of several urgent appeals fromthe Censorship authorities to   Service Departments that if what they require of one paper is ignored by that paper or another they should support their security requirements by a prosecution.Within these limits the newspapers have, on the whole, co-operated in making the system of voluntary submission moderately successful.But, without effective sanctions, it can never secure anything like 100 percent Censorship of military matters.     The Press is organized on a basisof intense and high-speed competition and any advantage gained withimpunity by one paper through carelessness or deliberate breach of Censor-ship Regulations is immediately followed up by the rest and enforcement isimperilled on the next occasion.

5.     TWO POSSIBLE METHODS OF SOLUTION ARE;-A. COMPULSORY CENSORSHIP.A new Defence Regulation could be enacted to the effect that nonews on ax list of prohibited subjects is to be published anywhere without having first passed the Censor.     It would then become an offence to publishany item of such news without authority, however much or however little itmay assist the enemy.     There are, however, serious objections to this method which must be promoted,(i) It means multiplying the staff of   Censors many times over.   Notonly will they have a great deal more material to deal with from the newspapers already effectively censored, but there will be a greatdeal of material, much of it, of course, quite innocuous, produced in the Provinces and Scotland which will need censoring.     B; would benecessary, to institute Regional Censorships, and very roughly, 300Censors would be required for this work, that is, five or six times the present staff.     Regional Censorships necessarily impair theuniformity in the treatment of news which can be achieved by a centralCensorship.(ii) New Censors have to be found and trained. It is difficult tokeep up even the present numbers with satisfactory recruits. ACensor&apos;s work is obviously responsible work and they are not highly paid. In fact, the pay rates correspond with those of a newspapersub-editor. There is no doubt that it would be the work of months to find and create the additional organization for this purpose.(iii) Lack of Service advice.     The constant supervision which theService Departments maintain in London would become impossible if the censorship were divided into Regions.     This would throw a heavyresponsibility on the Censors and tend to &quot;block&quot; most news owing totheir playing for safety.     Incidentally, Service Advisers who are notin constant touch with their Departments are not much better informedthan Censors as to the safe or the dangerous in news.B.     COMPULSORY SOURCES.This system would prohibit the publication of any matter on alist of defined subjects except official communiques, news distributedby the big News   Agencies (whose material would all be censored beforedistribution) and any additional matter broadcast by the B.B.C.     Such asystem involves very arbitrary treatment of the Press and cuts rightacross its present individualist and competitive system.It has the following considerations to recommend it:-(i) It could be broi^ht into operation on short notice, since it requires no additional staff of Censors.(ii) Unlike the first alternative, it could in fact be worked under conditions of seriously impaired communications.     It avoids the weakness of instituting a system of compulsory Censorship and thenfailing in an emergency, when news is eagerly sought for, to implement the system by providing means whereby adequate  C ensorship of tb&quot;Country&apos;s Press would be possible,.

- k- -It is subject to the following objections:-(i) On all important matters each newspaper&apos;s news would be unif orm.They would lose individuality and the background of informed explana-tion and discussion of current War news.(ii) News Agencies do not, generally speaking, serve weeklies.Arrangements will have to be made for making their services generallyavailable and for the Government protecting the maintenance of their services as a direct responsibility.(iii) Such a rigorous limitation of news might have the effect of creating in the public a feeling of mystification and panic.     Thisis the view of the newspapers.The disadvantages of each of the systems outlined in the previous paragraph raise the question whether it is not possible to find some system which is free from the gravest objection to either.     The principalobjection to compulsory Censorship is the elaborate machinery required tocensor the Press of the country.     The principal objection to the system of compulsory sources is the rigidity, and uniformity which it imposes upon thewhole Press,     These objections might be met by the institution of a -CENSORSHIP BOARD.If a Board could be set up to give Censorship directions,which should be binding upon the newspapers, the whole work of actuallypassing newspaper material through the Censorship could be abolished;    and yet, provided the directions were observed, the newspapers, apart frontusing the compulsory sources, could publish their independent material from other sources.     Anything, no matter what its subject, would be permissible, so long as it did not infringe the directions,(a) After eight months&apos; experience of Censorship work there is nooverwhelming difficulty in producing a code of what might and what might not be said on War subjects, so far as general directions go.In fact, much of the work on matter now submitted for Censorshipconsists in applying just such general rules;   and the papers shouldbe able to do this work for themselves.(b) The general directions would naturally be extremely rigorous,Itwould be the duty of the Board, meeting twice a day, to notify thePress (over the P.A. wire) of ad hoc directions or modifications on particular subjects of current news.(c) The Board should consist of a representative of each service department and Home Security, two members of this Ministry and tooPress representatives (men in active Press life).     It is essentialthat the Service representatives should be officers of high rankenjoying complete discretion on the part of their Department.     One**f the greatest difficulties of conducting the Press Censorship hasbeen the fact that the   Service Departments have not deputed officersof high authority to supervise the Censorship.(d) The Board&apos;s directions, to be effective, must be made legally binding, and they must be supported by effective and rapid penalties,ranging from fine to suspension.     The power of the Board to give directions with regard to such matters as criticism must be expresslynegatived.If the idea of a Censorship Board meets with the approval of theWar Cabinet, I would propose to t ake immediate steps to put it intooperation.D.C.
