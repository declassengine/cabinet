(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CEP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.)Copy No.SECRET-w.p. (g) (ifO) 1^.June 10th, 19WWAR CABINETRK^ONSIBILITY FOR B0B.C. ANNOUNCET.CENTS.Memprpndum by the Minister of Information.1. In my Memorandum W, P.  (g) (4&amp;) 136 of 24th May, I asked theWar Cabinet (paragraph k) to agree that, with the single exception of instructions to troops broadcast on the direction of the Commander in chief., Home Forces, the arrangements approved by the Civil DefenceCommittee in the previous week (namely that all official broadcastannouncements should be communicated to the B.B.C. by the Ministry ofInformation on behalf of the Government Department from which, theyoriginate) should be strictly adhei&quot;ed to, even in an emergency such ,as an air-raid02o The War Cabinet approved this proposal, with a reservationwhich is not now relevanta3a The original object of this arrangement was to make one department responsible   for checking the accuracy of these announcementsin order to prevent any fake messages from reaching the B.B.C. in future.At the time I did not myself intend, and the War Cabinet probably did not intend either, that this approval should confer on the Ministry ofInformation any responsibility for the content of announcements which other Departments might wish to have broadcastsif. There is at present however no assurance that the variousdepartmental announcements will be made to conform with the generalpolicy of H.M.g. at the time.   The broadcast word speeds in a flasharound the whole country and to other countries beyond;   it reaches animmensely wider public, both at home and abroad^ than any other form of publicity;   once spoken, it cannot be recalled.   It is easy to imaginewhat confusion might be caused by -the lack of any oo-ordlnatin^ machinery^I am satisfied that it&apos; is necessary that proper provision should be made,with Cabinet authority, for co-ordinating departmental announcements withgeneral policy, and I ask the War Cabinet to delegate this editorialresponsibility to myself, because;(a) the Ministry of Information is the only Department which, underthe decision already taken, is in a position to take such action byreason of having all the necessary material at its disposal:(b) the principal aspects of general policy with which it is desiredto secure co-ordination of the various departmental policies are thosewhich particularly concern this Ministry, namely the maintenance of thenational morale; the maintenance by means of publicity of Anglo-Frenchgoodwill;     the effect on public opinion in neutral oountries, andespecially in the U.S0Ae, and in the Empire;   and the relations ofGovernment with the Press and the B.BoQ0

(c) the Ministry of Information, having the latest news from all quarters at its disposal, is in a unique position for judging whether any last minute developments necessitate change in the departaentalproposals.(d) The technical problems arising out of the special war-timerelations of Government with the Press and the B.B.C., are matters whichare less familiar to other Departments, and the experience of this ministry has already shown hew easy it is for them to be overlooked.Moreover the special requirements of the spoken word in broadcastannouncements can best be met here.   It may often be desirable to issueannouncements in different forms for broadcasting and the Press.6, For these reasons I ask for authority to co-ordinate and ifnecessary edit, and generally to control the issue of all officialannouncements, intended to be broadcast, subject to the following conditions which I hope will remove any fear on the part of Ministerslest the authority for which I ask should be arbitrarily exercised:(i) if the Ministry desire to make any alteration in the terms ofan announcement, it shall notify the originating Department before theannouncement is made, giving as long notice as possible, and explaining the reasons for which the alteration is proposed.(ii) if the officials directly concerned cannot agree, the matter shallbe referred to the responsible Ministers or the Permanent Heads of theDepartments,(iii) if the subject matter of the announcement is service operations,the decision shall rest with the responsible Department,(iv) if not, then (a) if the changes proposed relate to matters forwhich the Ministry of Information is responsible, the final decision shallrest with this Ministry;    (b) in all other cases the final decision shallrest with the originating Department,7. To save time, and prevent wasteful enquiries, I recommend thatit shall be an instruction to all Government Departments that in issuingannouncements they shall add a statement that &quot;in the drafting of this announcement, the necessary co-ordinating action has been taken with thefollowing Departments...1,&quot;     The Ministry of Information would then take no further steps to co-ordinate action unless either -(i) its own policy were concerned; or(ii) it was aware, from recent information at its disposal, of developments which rendered further co-ordination desirable,8, There remains the case of decisions taken by the War cabinet itself, or one of its Standing Committees, regarding public announcements.So long as I am present at the meeting when these matters are disoussedano difficulty will arise.   In case however such a decision should be taken during my absence, I ask that it may be a standing instruction to theSecretary of the Cabinet or Cabinet Committee that the decision shall beminuted as subject to the Minister of Information being satisfied asregards those aspects of policy for which he is responsible1.

Since all official announcements intended to be broadcast arealso issued to the Press, and vice versa, the effect of these recommendations is to make ne responsible, to the extent defined, forthe issue of all Government announcements&apos;*if). Finally, there is the question of Ministerial speeches. i venture to think that it would be advantageous if all Minis teas, otherthan Members of the War Cabinet, would be good enough to send me adraft of their broadcast speeches in advance, in order to give me anopportunity of drawing their attention to any point on which I may feel that amendment or omission would be desirable from, the standpointof this Ministry.
