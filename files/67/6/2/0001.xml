Bis&apos;dOCUMLNT is THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ami c MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENTSECRET.AcPo(G)(40)10213TH APRIL.1940.COPY NO,WAR CABINETDIVERSION OP SHIPPING.Report by the Minister without Portfolio.IcINTRODUCTION.At their Meeting on the 11th April the War cabinet invited me to examine, with the Ministers concerned, the points raised by the Minister of Shipping in the discussion and toreport to the War Cabinet what,,  if anys  amendments should he made in the Memoranda by the Minister of Transport and LordChatfield (f,P.(G)(40) 82 (Revise) and 83).2o I have had the advantage of discussing these questions at a Meeting attended by the Ministers of Transportj  Supplys Poodand Shippingj  the Permanent Secretary to the Board of Trade(representing the President)9 the Secretary to the Department of overseas Trade and senior officers cf the Departments concerned,as well as by officers of the Naval and Air Staffs.3. The trend of the remarks made by the Minister ofShipping at the War Cabinet were to the effect that the estimateof the probable consequences of a diversion of shipping from theEast to the West Coast were possibly too optimistic and that perhaps sufficient account had not been taken of the effect ofa major diversion of shipping upon the trade of the countryboth generally and in reference more particularly to the exportof coal to Prance.

4, His observations were not conceived as a criticism ofthe plan for the diversion of shippings in the preparation ofwhich his Department had co-operateds hut were rather intendedto set forth the concern felt &quot;by his Departments his predecessor.,and himself9 lest the War Cabinet should under-rate the risks involved in a diversion of shipping continued over a long periOdaand over-rate the power of the scheme to surmount them.      Heapprehended that the result of an unduly favourable estimate ofthe scheme might be that when the emergency aroses and they were asked to divert shippings the Far Cabinet might take their decision too readily ands in seeking to avoid an immediate dangersrun into another which on a long view., was even greater.5, Lord Chatfield1s general impressions on the scheme forthe diversion of shipping are set forth in paragraph 11 of his report (,!roP^(Go)(40)83) in the following terms:-&quot;Probable effects of diversion,11,      While it is impossible to speak with any certaintyin advance? the best judgment which one can form from theMinister of Transport&apos;s Report is9 I thinks that if theWest Coast ports started at normals the arrangements which have &quot;been worked out offer a reasonable prospect that the ports could stand a heavy diversion for? say9three weeks or sos before the difficulties of theposition became acute0      Ifs however complete diversionwere to last for a prolonged periods the result would begrave congestion in the &quot;Vest Coast ports.      This does not mean that a state of unmanageable confusion would ensue0It is clears howevers  that the rate of imports into &quot;thecountry would be seriously reduceds  and shipping would be delayed..      By degrees we should adjust ourselves to thisslower rate of importss and we should hopes  after a time5with increasing experiences to effect an improvement onthat rate,&quot;This passage does not differ in substance from paragraph 28 ofthe Minister of transport s Report (v% P, (G-) (40) 32 (Revise) son which it was probably based,60 As I shall presently show9 the difference between theMinister of Shipping and some of his colleagues is one of emphasis rather than of principle.

MILITARY ASPECTS.7. As it is some years since I was closely associated withthis question I thought it well to begin by bearing the views ofrepresentatives of the Air Staff and Naval Staffo80 The appreciation of the Naval and Air experts as to thecircumstances in which a diversion of shipping might have to beconsidered did not differ very much from, the previous views ofthe Staffs 9 with which the r&apos;ar Cabinet are familiar..      They didnot wish the minds of my colleagues and myself to be influencedtoo favourably by the success hitherto achieved by the FightingServices in protecting shipping and repelling raids..      they pointed out that hitherto such raids had been conducted byrelatively small forces directed against ships at sea.      Thisafforded no clue to the consequences which might follow fromcontinuous attacks by the very large bomber forces available toGermany if directed not only against our ships but also against our ports;    attacks which9 instead of being sporadic as hitherto9might become systematic and sustained for a long period of time*jIn particulars, Air Commodore Stevenson impressed upon us thedifficulties of the defence in dealing with bombing attacks atni ght 090 One point9 to which perhaps I should draw the attentionof the War Cabinets was that large-scale attacks need by no meansbe confined to the Mast Coast ports0      Bristol9 Liverpool andGlasgow we were informed,, are all liable to heavy bombing attacksTo some extent this supports the thesis of the Minister ofShipping that the rar Cabinet ought to exercise considerablecaution in approving a diversion of shipping,, for it would seemat first sight that ships would be not much safer in a &apos;7est Coastthan in an East Coast port.      It has to be remembered,, however 

that the voyage for an ocean going ship to and from -Last coast ports is much longer and more dangerous than in the case of ports on the West Coast,10. Lord Chatfield&apos;s view of the military aspects of thisquestion are expressed in the following extract from the Minutesof a Meeting he held on the 28th March:-&quot;He did not &quot;believe that it was within the powerof the enemy to sustain sufficiently intense air attacks on shipping or facilities at the East coast ports for more than two or three month so      during that period it v/ould undoubtedly he necessary to accepta slower rate of imports and to he prepared for the&quot;queueing up&quot; cf ships waiting to he unloaded.&quot;Ho It is a matter on which one person&apos;s view is almost asgood as another&apos;ss &quot;because we have as yet no experience of a heavy and sustained attack.      My personal impression does not differ much from Lord Chatfield&apos;s.      Prohably few of us believethat German attacks are likely to he so overwhelming9  socontinuous and so long sustained;, that5 irrespective of losses9wear and tear of machiness  and weathers  they can maintainattacks without intermission for an indefinite period.Equally few9  if any9  are likely to hold the view that the plans for a diversion can he so successful that 9 in the suggested emergency9 they will enable us to maintain our imports and their internal distribution or our standard ofliving and war effort at the present level while the diversion lasts.      As     practical men, what we have done isto produce as good a scheme as we can5  and what we have todo is to improve it continuously9 and that also is in hand.I will therefore now turn to the scheme itself.

31 ie je oTHE DIVERSION SCHEME.12. I have spent as much time as I could spare in examining, with the assistance of Mr. R. 2i. Tolerton, theChairman of the Port and Transit Organisation, the plan of diversion that has &quot;been prepared and the machinery forcarrying it out.      The arrangements are described in the papers already submitted to the War Cabinet.      It is sufficient to say that, as one would expect at this stage of the war, they are a great advance on the pre-warplans, with which I was familiar in former days.   Moreover,the Port and Transit Standing    Committee meets daily, and during the period of relatively static warfare the wholeorganisation has &quot;been carrying out, in comparatively slowtime, the tasic which it would have to perform at a muchmore rapid tempo in the event of a decision to divertshipping.      In the course of our meeting one or twoconstructive suggestions were made for preparations whichwould enable the plan to he brought into operation in morefavourable conditions than at present.1.3* The Minister of Shipping would like a strongeffort to be made to clear the ports on the v/est Coast,so that if and when the emergency arises    the quays and transit sheds will not already be overcrowded, as is liable to happen.      In this connection the Ministry pointout that the clearing of the port and not of the ship is always the bottler-neck in congestion of ports.11+. The Ministers of Supply, Transport and Food are all prepared to do their utmost in assisting in thismatter.      Obviously the capacity of the factories or stores

to which goods have to he consigned is not -unlimited.To take an extreme case, it is wasteful to send someconsumable store, like meat, in quantities in excess ofthe storage capacity at its destination.     And similar considerations arise in many commodities.15* The Ministers concerned agree with me that thePort and Transit Standing Committee, which keeps a closeday-to-day watch on the position at every port, should do its utmost to carry out the suggestion of the Ministerof Shipping.16. The Minister of Pood raised a  question as to thenumbers of coal hoppers for the conveyance of grain.     &apos;.7eagreed to refer that matter also to the Port and TransitStanding Committee.17* In the event of a -prolonged diversion of shippingit may become necessary to use the facilities of our ports more and more for the handling of essential imports,and exports are bound to suffer.      This will exercise aserious effect on the export of coal to Prance, as wellas on the distribution of coal in this country.     This isone of the risks which the war Cabinet will have to take into account in talcing a decision either to divert shippingor to maintain the diversion indefinitely.18. On a review of the Reports on Diversion ofShipping,  (A.Pk (G) (ho) 82 (Revise) and  ..P. (G)(itO) 83),in the light of our discussion I see no reason to differsubstantially from Lord Chatfield&apos;s summary, except thatI should prefer to omit the last sentence of paragraph11.      The paragraioh would then read as follows:-&quot;(Probable effects of diversion.11.     Vvhile it is impossible to speak with any certainty in advance, the best

judgment which one can form from theMinister of Transport&apos;s Report is, Ithink, that if the V/est Coast portsstarted at normal, the arrangements which have been worked out offer areasonable prospect that the portscould stand a heavy diversion for, say,three weeks or so, before the difficultiesof the position became acute.      If,however, complete diversion were to last for a prolonged period, the result wouldbe grave congestion in the West coast ports.      This does not mean that a stateof unmanageable confusion would ensue.It is clear, however,  that the rate ofimports into the country would be seriously reduced, and shipping would be delayed.&quot;I do not believe that anyone can forecast what would happen beyond the first two or three weeks.      It is quite possible, for example, that there would be intervalsduring which we were able to work through to the east coast a certain number of convoys and to handle them at ports, only parts of which were out of action.    our decisions would have to be taken according to a situationwhich would be in a constant state of flux.     I do notmyself take an unduly pessimistic view of the situation,but I agree that the Minister of Shipping was right to warn the War Cabinet against excessive optimism.IV.SUPERVISION ON BEHALF OF THE WAR CABINET.19* With the assent of the Ministers who took part inthese discussions, I recommend the War Cabinet to chargeone of its colleagues with the task of acting as a refereeto whom they can appeal in any question of doubt ordifficulty on which they feel that he can assist them.

Vo20. From trie foregoing paragraphs it will he seen thatsuch differences as existed between those concerned inthis matter were in emphasis rather- than in principle.I feel sure that there is no risk,  if ever there were such a risk, that the   /ar Gcbinet will under-rate the long-range dangers of wholesale and prolonged diversion.     Atthe same time it is reassuring to all of us to know thatthere.is in existence not only a carefully thought outplan which will at least tide us over an initial periodof difficulty, but also an organisation capable of operating it.21. My recommendations sire as follows(a) That the   i&amp;r C-binet should approve the plans for the diversion of shirking dealtwith in W.p. (g) [hO)  82 (Revise)&quot; and W.p.(G)(hG) 83,  subject to the above remarks,(b) That the Port and Transit Organisation shouldcontinue its very important and valuablework in improving the plan, and that,  inparticular, it should give immediateattention to the recommendation of theMinister of Shipping set forth inparagraphs 13 and 14, and take up thequestion of grain transport mentioned bythe Minister of Pood (paragraph 16).(c) That the ./ar Cabinet should invite one oftheir colleagues to keep in touch with thework of the Government Departments.concerned in this Important question and act as a referee to whom Ministers can come for assistance in any case of difficulty.(Initialled) HcTreasury Chambers.
