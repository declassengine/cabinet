OEBTCOPY NO.*war CABINET(40) 1526DUTCH AND BSLG-IAN WAR REFUGEES.^thJfeVjJtjHOoMemorandum by the Home Secretary.I desire to bring before the War Cabinet the question of the reception ofwar refugees from Belgium and Hollando     Before the invasion of Belgium and.Holland, plans had been prepared, with the approval of the Civil  -DefenceCommittee, for the reception of a number of refugee so     At that time it was contemplated that this countoy might have to take up to 100,000 persons comingdirect to. this country from Holland and Belgium and we had agreed with, theFrench authorities that we would take 100,000 coming to this country via France,but our plans also provided for the reception if called upon to do so, of anadditional 100,000 from France, making a total of 300,000 refugees in all.The plans contemplated that the 100,000 refugees coming-direct to thiscountry from Belgium and Holland should be diverted to ports on the West coast,where the landing of the refugees would be regulated in such a manner as toenable the Authorities on shore to make a careful examination of the individual cases and to provide for their accommodation.     As regards the refugees coming to this country via France, the French Authorities were requested to conduct a preliminary examination of the individuals on French soil, to supply each personwith a &quot;carte d&apos;identite&quot;, and to regulate the flow of refugees from France tothis country in convenient batches.These plans have, to a large extent, broken down, because the liners whichwere to have conveyed refugees from Belgium and Holland direct to this country are no longer available, and the shipping which is available cannot be sent tothe West coast ports, because it is needed for a shuttle service between thiscountry and the Continent.     As a result, a large and unregulated number of refugees is coming to South coast ports direct from France and Belgium and is causing congestion, both at the ports and at the reception centres in London,The French have now represented that, in view of the comparatively small numbers which this country has had to receive direct from Holland and Eulgium, weshould now agree to undertake to receive from France a larger number of refugeesthan the original plan had provided for viz 100,000o     The Foreign Office have \told the French that this country would be prepared to take 200,000 refugeesdirect from France, but the Foreign Office expect the French to bring the strongerpressure on us to receive an even larger number of refugees than 200,000.     It isunderstood that there are, at the moment, on Frenoh soil some 500^000 refugees from Belgium, who are seriously interfering with the conduct of military operations.The first question on which a decision by the War Cabinet is required is whether the interests of this country justify us in implementing the undertakingrecently given to the French to accept as many as 200,000 refugees from France,and whether if the French, as expected by the Foreign Office, ask us to receive

The next question for consideration is whether we should not stipulateno refugee should be sent to this country from France unless theinore than 200,0005 we should enter into iany further commitments.-In considering this question, account must he taken of the fact thatthe registered alien population of this country before the war amountedonly to some 240,000 persons? so that an influx of another 200,000 Belgianrefugees would nearly double the resident alien populationoIf machinery existed for a careful examination.of the refugees with aview to preventing the entry of undesirables or Fifth Columnists, it wouldbe possible to contemplate the doubling of the alien population with greater equanimity a     The essence of the problem is to relieve the french as soon as possible of the undesirable burden of refugees on their soil,who, it is understood, are interfering with military operations, hut ifrefugees are admitted to this country quickly in very large numbers, theauthorities responsible for security cannot guarantee that among: them therewill he none who are ill-dispose doMoreover, it is somewhat of an anomaly to take elaborate precautions against Germans and Austrians in this country, who have been carefully-sifted and about whom a good deal of information is available, while atthe same time we admit a large number of foreigners, of whom we know nothingoOn the other hand, account must be taken of the military considerations.It has been represented, that Fifth Columnists in France behind the fightingzone may be liable to do more harm than they could do in this country.If the Government decide that our undertaking to France must be implemented, and that military considerations make it imperative to relieve the French of a substantial portion of the refugees now on French soil, i hope that it will not be necessary to agree to receive more than a totalof 200,000 refugees from France.     The flow of these refugees to thisCountry must be regulated so as to prevent a clogging of the machinery forinterrogating them and providing them with accommodation, and it is estimatedthat the maximum intake is of the order of -10,000 a day.Y/whatever numbers we agree to receive from France, I propose to make certain arrangements with a view to reducing the risks to security, ofwhich the following are the more important features, namely:-(l)   To secure the services of some 100 Belgian Surete and police officers to assist in interrogating the refugees on arrival inthis country.(2)   To make arrangements whereby on arrival at ports in this country,the refugees are taken under escort to accommodation, where they canbe temporarily detained for examination by immigration officers andthe Security Services, in collaboration with the Belgian officers.(5)   To make an Order subjecting every refugee who has arrived inthis country since the 10th May, to certain special restrictions,which at present apply to &quot;Enemy Aliens&quot;:   these restrictions limitfreedom of movement and prohibit the possession of certain articles*such as cameras, maps, telescopes etc. without the permission ofthe Policeo

Home Office.French   authorities have undertaken a preliminary examination3 with aview especially to considering whether he could not properly he requiredto return to his own hcme0     It seems however the representations madeby the French authorities as to the grave difficulties with which they are confronted, that the delay, which any arrangements for examination on french soil would, cause, would result in hampering to a still greater extent the military operations.Apart from the question of security, there is considerable difficultyin obtaining accommodation for any considerable number of refugeiesoApproaches have been made to the Government of Sire, with a view to theiragreeing to take a certain proportion of the refugees, and a message hasbeen received at the Dominions Office that the Eire Government areprepared to receive at least 1,000 refugees.Among the refugees who remain in this country, there will be many who could, be usefully employed, including particularly those who have hadexperience in agricultural work     Arrangements will be made to obtain,in the course of the examination of the refugees on their reception here,information as to their aptitudes for different employment so that thebest possible use can ultimately be made of the services of those who are allowed, to remain in this country.J.A.
