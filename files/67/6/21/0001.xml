Cj^   1191.SECKET COPY NO.    /% war   cabinet,P,(&amp;) (40)121.jrdMay. 1940.SUGAR   RATIONINGMemorandum by the Minister of Food.1. The question of rationing sugar was before the Cabinet on 6th December, 1939, (W.M. (39)106th Conclusions).     The Cabinet decided to rationsugar for domestic consumption as from 8th January, 1940, at 12 ozs. per head.Supplies of sugar for manufacturing purposes were reduced as from 1st February, 1940 (1st April in the case of the Brewers) by percentages varying.. between 25^ and 75j^, the details being as set out in the attached Statement I.The Cabinet was informed that to maintain this distribution the supplies of sugaravailable from the Empire and from the home crop would have to be supplemented by the purchase of 300,000 tons of foreign sugar, a step which was agreed andhas been carried out.2, In January the programme of sugar shipments was amended at the instanceof the Ministry of Shipping so as to spread Empire purchases over a longer period.To fill the gap a proposal was made to purchase an additional 100,000 tons offoreign sugar.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed to the purchase of50,000 tons, but he has suggested that a further drain on foreign exchange assetsshould be avoided by making additional cuts in the supplies of sugar allocated to manufacturing purposes such as chocolate, confectionery, and miscellaneousmanufactures (e.g. ice cream) and possibly by reducing the sugar ration with.M. Forces.40 The Cabinet was informed in December that the stocks considered essential to ensure orderly distribution were 400,000 tons raw and refined,250,000 to 300,000 tons being regarded as the minimum safety stock.     The stockat the end of December, 1939, was 360,000 tons (refined value) and by the end ofMarch, 1940, it had declined to 290,000 tons.     Until a few days ago it was contemplated that if the remaining 50,000 tons of foreign sugar were notpurchased, stocks would fall by the end of September, 1940, to the low level of260,000 tons and would be at minimum safety levels^     Cable advices now received

indicate a further shortage in the British West Indies crop of 60,000 tons, sothat if the present sugar ration is maintained and the 50,000 tons of foreign-sugar are not forthcoming, stocks at the end of September, 1940, will be down to200,000 tonsy assuming that the whole arrivals programme is realised withoutshipping losses or delays.5. Sugar stocks are essential both in the form of refined sugar to maintainthe flow of Sugar distribution and also as raw sugar to maintain the refiningprocessi     A stock figure at the end of September of 260,000 tons might well have involved not only unemployment and intermittent working at refineries, and also a risk of failure to maintain the sugar ration over the whole country.     A figure of200,000 tons converts these risks into certainties.6. I have considered whether the position could be met by cuts in manufacturing supplies and in the Services ration on the lines suggested by theChancellor of the Exchequer.     For the reasons indicated in Statement II. I cannot recommend a further cut in supplies to brewers, or manufacturers of jam, bottledand canned fruits, chocolate, mineral waters etc., or candied peel.     The only other substantial users are the confectionery trade, the cake and biscuit trade,the bakers (already cut by 40$) and the miscellaneous users (ice cream, jellies,coffee essences etc.) which have been cut by 50$ on pre-war usage.     A further cut of 10$ of pre-war usage for these groups would save about 47,000 tons in a full year, or say 16,000 tons in the four months June - September.7. The ration to H.M. Forces (21 oz, pdr week at home and 24g--oz. per weekabroad) is high and is being reduced to some extent, but a reduction to say 16 oz.at home and 20 oz. abroad would only save about 10,000 tons in a full year or3,300 tons in four months.8- A further saving of 25,000 tons in a full year or 8,000 tons in four months might be made if supplies of sugar to catering establishments for serving with hot drinks were withdrawn.9. Even, however, if all these cuts were imposed on 1st June, I should stillbe some 23,000 tons short of the amount required to bring stocks at the end ofSeptember up to minimum safety level (250,000 tons) and this figure allows noma-rgin for shipping losses or delays.

^0, The conclusion is that a further purchase of foreign sugar is unavoidable unless the domestic ration is reduced.     Because of the &quot;brokenfarthings&quot; problem and of difficulties of packing there is no halfway housebetween a ration of 12 ozs. per week and a ration of 8 oz.     A reduction of this amount would save 274,000 tons in a full year, or say 68,500 tons in the threemonths July - September.11. A reduction in the domestic ration would be unpopular.     Sugar has beenrationed for three months only, but more complaints have been received regardingthe quantity of the sugar ration than in regard to any other rationed commodity.Moreover, a reduction in the sugar ration would lead to a larger consumption of bread, and this would mean increased consumption of a subsidised food (wheat and flour) as compared with sugar which yields a substantial revenue to the Exchequer.The reduction in the domestic consumption (as compared with normal) asa result of the present rationing is approximately 25$.     If we give only 8 oz.this means a reduction of approximately 50$ and already there are signs of thecry being raised that we are sacrificing the people&apos;s food for the benefit of thebrewing industry.     My colleagues are more competent than I am to judge theimportance of this issue politically.

STATEMENT II.Trades where no further cut is recommended.1, JAM MANUFACTURE. Present cut 30$.2,     BOTTLING AND CANNING-.    &quot;       &quot;    50$.These trades must play an important part in the preservation of thehome fruit crop, and it would he premature to cut their sugar supplies until the size of the fruit crop can he estimated. .3,     BREWERS. Present cut 30$.Revenue considerations are involved.     The sugar can to some extent bereplaced by barley but it requires 2 tons of barley to replace 1 ton of sugar.4o     CHOCOLATE MANUFACTURE.     Present cut 30$.The Government has large cocoa commitments and is confronting apossible loss of  2 - 3 millions on the present crop of West African cocoa.     Itwould be uneconomic to cut sugar supplies to this trade for the present, and sonot only decrease supplies to consumers but also increase the loss on west african cocoa.5c     MINERAL WATERS AND SUNDRY BEVERAGES.       Present cut 60$6.     CANDIED PEEL. Present cut 75$.These trades have already suffered very heavy cuts and very pressingrepresentations have been made by them for larger allotments.
