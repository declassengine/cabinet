SURVEY OF EMPLOYMENT.Results of the Enquiry conducted in April. 1940.1,     Returns &quot;by employers under the Factory Undertakings (Records and information) (No.l) Order, 1940, giving information as to the number of work-people employed in June 1939 and in the first week of April 1940 have been collected in respect of the following two groups of industries:-A.     General, electrical, marine and constructional engineering, and construction and repair of motor vehicles and aircraft; and b*     Shipbuilding and ship-repairing.The figures in the returns relate to operatives and exclude managers, foremen,clerks, typists, commercial travellers, salesmen and salaried persons generally.2.     The following table summarises the information obtained from the enquiry(a few returns are still awaited but they will not affect the resultsmaterially): -Engineering, motor and aircraft group.     -  Great Britain.

The total number of persons aged 14-64 of the classes included in employers&apos;returns, who were in employment at 12th June, 1939, as estimated from theworking of the unemployment insurance scheme, was approximately 1,123,000.1.

The following table gives the increases between June, 1939 and April, 1940(exclusive of Admiralty establishments) in each of the Ministry of Labour and national Service administrative divisions.     The rate of expansion has been most marked in Wales but the largest numerical increase has occurred in theNorth Western Division where the rate of expansion has also been well above theaverage for the country as a whole.The returns are equal to 99.8 per cent of this figure and the increase of11.5 per cent gives a total increase of about 129,000, thus raising thefigure of 1,123,000 to 1,252,000.4.     The following table shows the estimated number of insured personsaged 14 - 64, of the classes included in the employers&apos; returns, who were inemployment in this group of industries at June of each year since 1935 -withthe increases in each year and the percentage of insured, persons unemployed atthe beginning of each year:-

Very few women and girls are employed.The following table gives the figures for private shipyards and Admiraltydockyards:-	Number employed.		Increase		June, 1939.	April, 1940.	Number.
