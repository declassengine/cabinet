The Prime minister referred the memorandum to me and asked me to considerthe question with which it deals as well as the general question of the further evacuation of children and make a recommendation to the Cabinet.        I proposeto deal with both these matters orally at an early meeting.(Intld.)N.C.Richmond Terrace, 5. W.1.

DISPERSAL OF PERSONS RESIDENT IN THE IMMEDIATE.NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SPECIFIC TARGETS.1. I have considered, in consultation with the other ministers responsible for Civil Defence measures,.thesuggestion that steps should he taken at once to securethat persons living in close proximity to certain types of target li&amp;ely to he selected by the enemy for precisionbombing shall leave their homes and secure other accommodation in areas at least one thousand yards distantfrom the target02o In the first place,  it is agreed that in presentcircumstances there can be no question of compulsory removalof persons resident within a radius of one thousandyards from these targetso       Secondly, my colleagues anaI are unanimously of the opinion that any appeal to personswithin these areas to remove themselves and their.familiesvoluntarily to alternative accommodation outside thedanger zone would not meet with any appreciable responseuntil air attacks on this country, involving loss of civilian life, have actually occurred.    It is true that-,within the last few days there have been some signs that members of the public are beginning to realise the dangerof air attack; but all our experience in organising the planned evacuation of school children satisfies us that even in the areas most likely to be attacked public opinion has not yet reached the stage at which any considerablenumber of people would respond to an invitation to moveaway from the neighbourhood of specific targets.    Wetherefore recommend that no attempt should be made toarrange for a voluntary dispersal of population from theimmediate neighbourhood of specific targets until therehas been such air attack on this country as will bring home clearly to people resident within those areas the dangers to which they are exposed.3. The Government evacuation scheme already providesfor the removal from the evacuation areas of schoolchildren whose parents are willing to allow their children to go to the comparative safety of the reception areas.It has been agreed that this scheme should not be p\it intooperation until air raids on this country have begun,, andthe scheme has been deliberately made flexible so that itcould be applied, either to all evacuation areas, or onlyto those which have actually been, or are likely to be,attacked.    It is contemplated that if attacks developon any particular type of target orders will at once begiven for the evacuation of school children from all theevacuation areas which contain targets of that type.4...        We therefore recommend that, if the enemy beginsprecision bombing on specific targets, the first step should be to set in motion the pre-arranged schOme for theordered evacuation of school children from all evacuationareas containing targets of the type selected for attack.We recommend further that, as soon as the evacuation of theschool children from these areas has been completed,arrangements should at once be put in hand to secure the dispersal of the remainder of the civilian populationresident within one thousand yards of the targets by thefollowing means:-.(a) Persons resident within that area should be warned that it is desirable that they should find other accommodation outside the area as soon as possible.

(b) Those who can do so should make private arrangements.(c) For others the local authority should make provision, either by billeting on otherhouseholders or by requisitioning emptyhouses.(d) Where recourse is had to billeting, every endeavour should be made to get billetsby agreement; but the local authority would be authorised to billet compulsorilyif the need arose.(e) Payment to receiving householders would bemade at the rate of 5/- a week for eachadult and 3/- a week for each child.These figures have been mentioned to theTreasury, who would raise no objection.Lodging only would be required; any arrangements for board would he a matter for agreement between the parties.(f) Where the local authority requisitionedempty houses, the cost of requisitioningand of any necessary equipment would berecouped by the Government.(g) It would not be practicable to recover from the persons evacuated any contribution towards the cost of accommodating them, whether in billetsor in empty houses.MINISTRY OF HOME SECURITY.16th May, 1940.
