Reprisals Pol icy to any, new Jrcemy^Memo rand urn by the iyjinister of Economic Warfare.I request the views of my colleagues on the subjectof the application of the Reprisals Order in Council to theexport trade of any new enemy which might at some time inthe future be allied to Germany.2. The Reprisals Order automatically applies to exports from any territory invaded and occupied &quot;by Germany, the exportbecoming in effect German Exports.      But it may be arguablewhether the Reprisals policy can properly be applied to theexport trade of a new enemy,  since at the outbreak of war itwould be unlikely to have committed any of the illegalitieswhich led to the application of the policy to Germany.3* If the illegalities had ceased, it might clearly bedifficult to justify the extension of the policy to a newenemy.      do far from having ceased,  they have been continued in an aggravated form and are clearly part of the settledmethod of waging the wa.v to which the new enemy will have madeitself a party.      It is also clear that whether the new enemycommits illegalities itself or net,  it will clearly be reapingthe benefit of those committed by its ally.      In the last warthe Reprisals policy was applied to all enemy countries altliouit was only Germany that had committed the illegalities at seathat led to its adojjtion.      It is true that these countries were, for the most part, already the allies of Germany, butit does not appear to make any substantial difference whetherthe association exists at the time or is brought into beinglater/

9later provided the illegalities are continuing.  &apos;  In either case common cause is made with the enemy and common treatmentseems justified.h. In practice it is evident that any foreign exchangeearned by the new enemy through its exports would go tosupport the general enemy cause,5, Finally, where the new enemy was linked to Germany bya common land frontier or &quot;by routes over which we could not exercise contraband control German exports would certainly be shipped in the guise of the exports of the new enemy, andthe administrative difficulties inherent in any attempt to distinguish between the exports of the two enemy countries would be virtually insuperable.6, I accordingly recommend that, the Reprisals policy should be applied to the new enemy. This would necessitate a further Order-in-Council which would recite the grounds ofthe extension.7* I should add that the secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Attorney-General have concurred in my proposals.(Initialled;     R.&amp;.C.
