In a memorandum of 13th.March, 1940, to the WarCabinet on the supply of labour for the British ExpeditionaryForce (W.P0(G)(40) 78)  the Secretary of State.for War.indicated the serious shortage in the numbers of the AuxiliaryMilitary Pioneer Corps in France for such labour work for theArmy and the Royal Air Force as concreting, in. forward areas,constructing roads and railways, preparing sites for andconstructing aerodromes,  constructing accomvaodation for.personnel and stores,  and handling and storing the vastquantities of munitions and other stores.and supplies .transported to and accumulated in France.    .2, The position has now become much more serious, andthe necessity for   action is vital and urgent.     The need forsuch labour in France has recently become more urgent, partly as a result of the military situation and partly as a resultof the withdrawal by the French Government of French labour which was being used to assist in the work for the B.E.F.This French labour has been withdrawn owing to the acute shortage in France of unskilled labour.     In fact, the french minister/
Minister of Labour, when he visited this country a fortnightago, pleaded for British help for the labour work for theFrench Array,     We feel  that it is essential to bri&amp;g theA.M.P.C. immediately up to sufficient strength to enable it toprovide all the labour required for the B.E.F.     Labour isalso required for the North WesternExpeditionary Force,     on estimates prepared before the present active phase of thewar, a labour force of at least 105,000 by the end of the year&apos;s  required;    of these only about 27,000 have been recruitedup to date.     But we feel that, in view of the labour shortage in France and as a gesture to our Ally, we should go further and increase the Corps to an extent that will enable ussubstantially to assist the French Army,     Accordingly vfesuggest we should aim at obtaining a Corps of at least150,000 by the end of the year.     This we think would be a valuable indication at this time of Great Britain&apos;determination,3, It is anticipated that it will not be possible toobtain more than 5,000 a month by voluntary enlistment duringthe next two or three months;    after that it will graduallydecline, and it is estimated that not more than about 11,000will be obtained by this means by the end of the year.     It isclear, therefore, that the intensified recruiting campaign for volunteers in the age groups 35-50 will not produce the men required.     Other methods must accordingly be adopted.4, The methods available for obtaining the men in thenumbers necessary are:-(a) To allow young men in the age groups 18-19 to enlistvoluntarily into the A..M.P.C.(b) To apply compulsion to the unemployed who are suitable for service in the A.M.P.C,(c) To obtain Chinese volunteers.(a)/
(d.)       To apply compulsion to men of allied nationality and friendly refugees of German and Austrian nationalityin the age groups 20-50.(e) To proclaim and call up the 40-41 age group,(f) To call up men under the National Service (armed forces) Act for the A.M.P.C.50 As regards (a), it might he thought that some political difficulty arises from Mr. Hore-Belishaf s assurances given to the House of Commons on 3rd September, 1939, duringthe passage of the National Service (Armed Forces) Act.These assurances were    (i) that it was not intended to call upmen under 20 until &quot;very late in the day&quot;i  (ii) before&apos; sending out of the country any man called up under the Actwhen under 20 an explanation would be given to the House and(iii)  that men voluntarily enlisted would not be sent overseasunder the age of 19.     Apart from this, there is a difference of opinion as to the numbers that would volunteer, and doubtshave been expressed as to whether the work would be suitablefor them, although we think these doubts are ill-founded.Furthermore, the French Minister of Labour pressed on us theimportance of sending older men to France for labour work.He emphasised that to send young men would create a very badimpression as all the young Frenchmen have been called up forcombatant duties.6. There are not the same objections about allowing menin the 18 and 19 age groups to volunteer for the Home DefenceBattalions and thus release men from this Corps for theA.M.P.C.    The political difficulty also does not arise inconnection with this proposal, which accordingly we recommend should be adopted.
7. As regards (Id), (c)  and (d) , there are obviousdifficulties in each method.     The application of compulsionto aliens is attractive., hut It is questionable whether,particularly .at&apos;- the present time and.in view of recent experience in connection with the &quot;Fifth Column&quot;, the riskinvolved should be- taken.     The position i&amp;, however, being examined to see if a practicable and safe scheme can be devised,8. As regards (e), the proposal would be to proclaimthe 40 age group- and call them up, oldest first, as soon aspossible.     It is estimated that this age group would yieldabout 50,000 men.     The merit of this method is that, as undethe existing law this age group will, by the time they arelikely to be required in the ordinary way, have become 41, anwill therefore have passed out of liability to be called up,the man-power for the Armed Forces would not be encroachedupon.     On the other hand, it is likely to raise political difficulties if a high-age group, such as 40, is called up before the younger age groups, even although it is for non-combatant duties.     Moreover, the country has been led to expect that the present method of going up the scale would continue, and to jump suddenly to the 40 age group would causenot only considerable inconvenience but possibly some dismay.9* As regards (f), sufficient men in the proclaimedage-groups have been registered and medically examined toenable the requirements of the&quot;A.M.P.C. to be fully met, inaddition to the requirements of the Armed Forces for combatantunits.      If this proposal were adopted, men would be called up in the ordinary way&apos; and posted to the. A .11.P.C. for 6 monthsafter which they would be transferred to combatant units.This method is the easiest and the quickest for obtaining themen required and has the additional advantage of hardening themen for 6 months before they are required for ordinary Armytraining.     Moreover, it would cause less inconvenience than any/
any other method, as it onljr involves a small increase in therate of calling up.     It should he emphasised that theadditional numbers involved would not otherwise he called up,as equipment is not available for training them.     Theadvantages of this method seems to us so clear that we haveno hesitation in recommending that the War Office, while continuing their campaign for volunteers, should obtain theadditional men they require for the A.M.P.C., includingsufficient to render effective aid to Prance, by increasing their demands for men called up under the Armed Forces Act.10. Our recommendations are,  therefore:-(l)       That the strength of the Auxiliary Military pioneer corps should be brought up to at least 190,000by the end of the year, to enable it to provide allthe labour force required for the british expeditionary Force (including the Ros^al Air Force)and the North Western Expeditionary Force and torender substantial assistance to the French Army.(2)       That the War Office should continue their intensified.campaign for volunteers in the age groups 35-50.(3)       That the additional numbers required should beobtained by calling up men under the Armed forces act and retaining them in the Auxiliary MilitaryPioneer Corps for 6 months before transferring themto combatant units.(4)       That an appeal for volunteers aged 18 and 19 for theNational Defence Force should be issued to enableother men in that Force to be released for the auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps.(5)       That the examination of the question of compulsorilyenlisting aliens should be pursued.17th May, 1940,A.E.E o Bo
