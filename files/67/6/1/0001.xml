SECRET.W.P. (G.) (40) 101.April 11, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THREE-POWER DECLARATION  REGARDING  THE   CONDUCT  OFTHE GERMAN  AUTHORITIES IN  POLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 30th January, 1940, the Polish Government suggested that a joint declaration should be made by the three Allied Governments protesting againstthe conduct of the German authorities in Poland. Negotiations have since takenplace between the three Governments, which have been delayed by the desire ofthe Polish Government to introduce passages which might have committed theAllied Governments further than seemed desirable in regard to (1) the eventualpunishment of war criminals, and (2) a possible commitment in regard to integralreparation to Poland.2. A text was eventually drafted (column 1 of Annex) which met Polishrequirements so far as possible without opening the way to any such undesirablemisinterpretations. This text incorporated certain suggestions put forward byHis Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions, who have been consulted. It was communicated to the Polish and French Governments for their concurrence on the3rd April.3. The French and Polish Governments have meanwhile prepared a revisedFrench text, an English translation of which forms column 2 of the Annex.Paragraphs 1-3 are identical with the original English text. Paragraphs 4 and 5of the Franco-Polish text, which summarise the wrongs committed by the german authorities in Poland, differ on points of detail, the additions being underlined.The significance of the distinction between Poles and Jews (who are also Polishcitizens) may hold the seeds of future trouble, as in the past Poland has sought by every means to promote the emigration of her Jews. But the distinction maybe justified by the establishment of the so-called Jewish &quot;reserve &quot; and is perhapsacceptable. On the other hand, the reference to &quot;territory which has always(de tout temps) been Polish &quot; is not accurate (except perhaps in an ethnographicalsense), since much of the territory in question was part of Germany for manyyears. It would be better if the phrase were reworded to read : &quot;in Polishterritory.&quot;4. In paragraph 5 two changes of some importance have been made :(a) the words : &apos;&apos; action of the German Government and of its agents &apos;&apos; have beensubstituted for the words : &quot; crimes committed by the German Government andtheir agents against the Polish population&apos;5 ; and (6) the word &quot;Germany&quot;has been substituted for &apos;&apos; the German Government &apos;&apos; in the last sentence. both these alterations seem to be logical.   Amendment (a) is no doubt intended to10975   [21125]Copy No.    I 3----------------9Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1940.
cover the point that some of the crimes enumerated have been committed againstthe Polish State and not against the Polish population. As regards amend-ment (&amp;), the French and Polish Governments agree in desiring to place theresponsibility upon Germany rather than upon a Government which may well have disappeared when the moment comes for righting Polish wrongs. both these amendments might, therefore, be accepted.5. The declaration is intended (1) to concentrate world attention upon theiniquities of German conduct in Poland, (2) to demonstrate Allied solidarity,(3) to encourage the Polish population in Poland, and (4) to deter the german authorities in Poland from further excesses. The French and; Polish Govern-ments are anxious that it should be issued as soon as possible. It is therefore proposed to inform the French and Polish Governments that we concur in theirrevised draft subject to the words &quot; in Polish territory&quot; being substituted inparagraph 4 for the words &quot; in territory Which has always been Polish.&quot;6. During the negotiations the Polish Government have intimated that they regard the last paragraph of the proposed declaration as a statement ofprinciple, and not as a contractual obligation, and that they would not base any claim upon it vis-a-vis ourselves or the French Government in the future. Iwould suggest that we should obtain a formal assurance from the Polish Govern-ment to this effect before the declaration is issued.H.Foreign Office, April 11, 1940.
Draft Declaration on CI. Draft agreed with the Dominions.1. His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom, the French Govern-ment and the Polish Government havebeen profoundly shocked at the reportsthey have received of the crimes againstperson and property committed by theGerman authorities and forces ofoccupation in Poland.2. These reports leave no doubt thatthe German Government, which openedthe war on the 1st September, 1939, bybrutal attacks upon the civilian popula-tion of Poland in defiance of the accepted principles of internationallaw, are now bent on destroying not onlythe lives and property, but also the cultural and religious existence of thedefenceless Polish population at present under their control.3. Further, in violation of the FourthInternational Convention of The Hagueof 1907, Germany has gone so far as to incorporate in the Reich territories ofthe Polish Republic, although the war between Germany and the three AlliedPowers is still continuing.4. Wholesale executions of the civilpopulation, deportations in circum-stances of the most ruthless barbarity,the abominable treatment inflicted on members of the Jewish community, thesettlement of Germans from outsidePoland and the illegal confiscation fortheir benefit of the property of Polishindividuals and of the Polish State,confiscations of property, the destruc-tion and pillage of historical andartistic monuments, the closing ofchurches and the persecution of religion, clearly reveal a deliberatepolicy aiming at the complete destruc-tion of the Polish nation.erman Action in Poland.II.
