CONTROL OP NEUTRAL SHIPS.memorandum by Minister of Shipping.REVIEW OP ACTION TAKEN AS REGARDS NORWEGIAN, DANISH and swedish VESSELS, AND OTHER VESSELS TRADING TO SCANDINAVIANBALTIC AND ARCTIC PORTS. AND AS REGARDS OTHER CONTROL OPNEUTRAL TONNAGE.Under the decisions of the War Cabinet as now being applied by the departments concerned, the position in regardto the control of neutral ships is as follows:-Sailings to Scandinavia.All sailings of Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, FinnishEstonian and Latvian ships to Scandinavian, Baltic andArctic ports from United Kingdom ports or contraband basesare being suspended.    No special instructions in this sensehave been given as regards Lithuanian (negligible), Russian,or other neutral vessels.DANISH VESSELS.All Danish vessels are being detained and all are being put in prize, other than those chartered to the United StatessItaly or Japan.    These exceptions are required by theconclusions of the Cabinet of the 10th April.    I suggest thatthe exceptions should now be withdrawn.    If maintained, theywould seriously lessen the amount of Danish tonnage which hasbeen forced into our control.I wish to point out also that there is no alternative toseizing the Danish vessels unless they are to remainimmobilised by detention in our ports, for we could not,without prejudicing our position as regards other DanishffECRET.

vessels, permit any of them to continue to sail under the danish Flagj nor can we, without formally transferring title to the Allies &quot;by seizure, prevent the benefit of the vessels&apos;trading accruing to their Danish owners and so to Germany,At my instance, Broadcast messages have been sent out inDanish, addressed to Masters of Danish ships, informing themthat their own and their Owners&apos; interests will best heserved by accepting Allied protection.   They have been told that they will be treated as friends, and that compensationwill be paid for the use of their vessels by the Allies.   Bythese means and by similar information sent out throughcommercial channels I hope that we shall influence many ofthese vessels, which it may not be easy to intercept, toproceed to Allied ports.    The latest development is the reported formation of a Committee of Danish shipowners in new York under the Chairmanship of the Danish Ambassador in washington.    I am awaiting advice from my representative inHew York on the subject.NORWEGIAN VESSELS.Norwegian vessels are &quot;being detained in British ports and are being brought in from the high seas, whether they arechartered to neutrals or not.   Efforts are being made throughcharterers, brokers, etc, to divert Norwegian vessels toBritish ports, and arrangements have been made whereby theyare held covered in respect of Marine and War Risks on hull and machinery and similar risks on cargo, both in cases where theyare at present in a neutral port and are diverted to an Alliedport, and in cases where they are at present at sea and areinstructed to proceed to their destination, if it is an allied port, or to the nearest Allied port.Messages have been sent to Norwegian ships warning themthat broadcasts ordering them to go to Neutral ports issuefrom the German puppet Government.    The Norwegian Minister in

London is endeavouring at my instance, to obtain authority from his Government to control Norwegian Shipping.   At myinvitation Mr. Hysing Olsen, the representative of theNorwegian Shipowners Association, who returned to London onThursday from Amsterdam where he was en route for Oslo, has agreed to he joined in the exercise of such authority it itcan be obtained.A message purporting to come from the Association to-dayadvised Norwegian Masters to proceed to Neutral ports. Ifsent, it was no doubt sent under duress, and steps have beentaken to try to counteract any impression that it is valid.A large number of Norwegian tankers are under chharterto Oil Companies, including the American Companies.   Theirdetention at, or their diversion into, an Allied port will inevitably create shortages in the supplies of oil in thecountries of destination.    This will lead to increased demands for tanker tonnage for the purpose of making goodloss of stocks in South America and elsewhdre, probably inno short time at panic rates of freight.   We may also findpolitical embarassments arise if the detention is long-continued.    The object of holding Norwegian vessels is that,in the event of Norway being over-run by Germany and makingterms, the tankers v/ill not be immobilised in neutral ports forthe remainder of the war.   It is thought, however, that in sucha case the American oil interests at least would be sufficientlypowerful to force Norwegian tankers taking refuge inUnited States or neutral or South American ports back into service, for the. oil supplies of the world and the Oil Companies1business can scarecely be maintained without some assistancefrom Norwegian tankers.   I suggest that orders might now begiven that for the time being Norwegian tankers under charter to American Oil Charterers should be free   to continue on certain voyages, and particularly to the Argentine and Uruguay.

We have, however, been warned that if such ships are onceallowed to enter a Chilean port there is grave risk that theGerman Embassy will apply for a legal embargo against sailing.The extent to which it is expedient to hold the Norwegiantonnage and especially the tankers is not an easy question todecide.      We shall suffer in supplies and in price, throughgeneral increases in freight, on any vessels we do notabsolutely control,  if the scarcity of tonnage is aggravated.On the other hand,  there is undoubtedly serious risk that someNorwegian vessels will become immobilised5 possibly for a long period,  if once they get to a neutral port.It will not, however, be possible to maintain our own oil supplies without loading many of the Norwegian vessels which wedo not control in neutral ports, American and Dutch.    On thewhole, I think that, unless the situation becomes much clearer inthe next two or three days, we must consider taking the risk of allowing Norwegian tankers time-chartered to United Statesinterests to proceed to limited destinations to be agreed indetail with the Foreign Office and Ministry of Economic Warfare,but not to Chilean, Mexican, Spanish,  Italian or Japanese portsbeyond any point (e.g. Gibraltar) at which they can with certainty be stopped^ -For allied destinations, I think that Norwegian vessels should be allowed to proceed, under armed guard so as to preventthe master making for a neutral port.This is already being arranged with the Admiralty and I amassured that every effort will be made by the Naval authorities tosupply a sufficient number of small armed guards to preventserious delays.For this purpose it would be a great advantage if we couldtreat Abadan,  as a port to which a vessel carrying an armedguard can be sent.It may also bo expedient to allow certain Norwegian vesselsother than tankers,  to proceed on certain neutral charters, and

9 A0*5these cases I propose to deal with on their merits but in avery cautious way.SWEDISH ships in the United Kingdom, Swedish vessels are now being allowed to sail, unless thejr are bound for Scandinavian,Danish, Baltic, or Artie ports.Until the 13th April Swedish ships were being held up andprevented from sailing to any destination from British portsabroad through various obstacles being put discreetly in theway of sailing, but this embargo has now been removed with theconcurrence of all the Departments concerned.ICELAND, GREENLAND AMD THE FAROE ISLANDS*The few vessels registered in Iceland and Greenland arebeing detained for the moment in the interests of their ownsafety and will not be seized.     The Faroese trawlers are nolonger being detained,HOLLAND AKD BELGIUM.Vessels now in the United Kingdom on passage to Holland andBelgium are being detained on contraband or other pretext,and sailings of British vessels to Holland were suspended bythe Admiralty at noon on the 13th April.     I feel that there arestrong objections to allowing further ships to proceed to thesecountries and thus have any control over them which we mightretain at all events for the next few days.R.S.H.;April,i9hO.
