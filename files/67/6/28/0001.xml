In view of the grave news of the German invasion of belgium and Holland I thought it appropriate  to call at once on mr.  de Valera.     I told him that I had received no instructions from my Government to ascertain his attitude towards these events and thatit was probably easier for both of us to ventilate our thoughtswithout any formal approach to the new problems created.    I had comeat once because - if I could presume to offer advice - it was alwayseasier to take a step when the reasons for it were obvious and whilepublic opinion was in a receptive mood.    Promptitude averted thepossibility of differing counsels and clouded issues.     It was obviousthat these new aggressions by Germany made it necessary for him to reconsider his position in relation to the Allied cause.    It was indeed a fateful moment in the history of his country and I trusteethat we should find Ireland in her natural place, namely, no longer-neutral in the cause of freedom.Mr.   de Valera at once invoked the old bogey of Partition.If things had worked out according to his plan the nation would havebeen in a united Ireland and his freedom of action and the spirit oftlie people would be totally different.    As things were, he had a difficult internal situation and though, no doubt,  there was a lot ofpro-Ally feeling in the country,  there was also a great deal of feeling of another sort, and there could be no disguising the factthat adherence to the British cause would create a grave situation.It was no use asking the people in Ireland to fight on behalf of freedom when freedom was denied in a portion of Ireland owing to theinfluence of an uncompromising minority.This talk on Partition ran its normal course and I will notrepeat the arguments and counter-arguments for they are stale.    I sai&quot;that the twenty-six counties might have achieved their presentliberties in a chapter of antagonism and bitterness, but that the onlhoPe of solving the remaining problems was by goodwill.    England hadsh own

shown great generosity in her dealings with the twenty-six counties,jjr. de Valera did not demur to this hut said &quot;I cannot understand wbvIjiv Chamberlain does not tell Craigavon to fix up his difficulties with us and come in.    That would solve the trouble&apos;5.    I said &quot;If the partition question were solved to-day would you automatically be ouractive Ally?&quot;    He replied &quot;I feel convinced that that wculd probably&quot;be the consequenceI said that the question was obviously only anacademic one as in wartime no attention could be given to the solutionof such questions.    However, I record his rejoinder as an indication of Mr.  de Valera:&apos;s line of thought.    He added that it was far from being his wish to exploit our difficulty to his own advantage.    his attitude remained the same in all conditions.I told Mr.  ds Valera that his view on a grave crisis in world affairs was from too narrow an angle.    Here was a maniacal forcelet loose in the world.    It was not a time to talk of Anglo--Irishdisputes which in the fullness of time would be peacefullyliquidated:.    I might have come to him to-day with my French, belgian and Dutch colleagues.    He would know what they would have said.Where did Ireland, stand to-clay?    Why not send an Irish Brigade toFrance?   Surely the soul of Ireland would be stirred etc. ,  etc. ,  etc,But we always travelled back to the old prejudice,  toPartition,  to the bitterness in the hearts of the active andextremist elements.    I suggested that with clear leadership theadventurous spirits would respond to a better call.    But Mr.   de Valerahsid to his narrow view.    He seems incapable of courageous or originalthought and now on this world issue and in every matter he lives toosuch under the threats of the extremist.    Temperamentally he has abias that way himself.    More robust elements in his Cabinet havestiffened him on the executive side.I said that surely he would no longer be able to toleratefee presence of a German legation in Dublin.    The story of Germanintrigue and Quisling ism in neutral countries had a lesson for him.He said that it would create grave difficulties for him internallyif- q ...

if he were to take action against the German legation.H; said the proper policy for Sire was to be strong in her own house.      She needed to be well armed.     We had blocked that.I explained that this was not the case.      He said that hisGovernment were undoubtedly inadequately armed for the propercontrol of the subversive elementsa      I said that he was wrong inattributing our failure to supply arms to suspicion.      Our need for arms of all kind was paramount.     That was the whole answer.However,  efforts were being made to help.     At the same time I must point out that it was not very attractive to us to send weaponsinto a country where a German legation has facilities for intrigue.Developments in the theatre of war would throw more work into the ports and harbours of Eire.      The British Navy is safeguardingIrish interests.     There was need for realism in facing the problems which would arise.It was not a satisfactory conversation but I thoughtit better to have it,  and to have it at the first moment possible,and without any glozing over of hard and unpalatable facts.Mr.  de Valera -was not prepared for it and if the conversation has reserved no other purpose it has revealed to his mind the fact thata new and graver situation has developed presenting him withvital problems in his leadership of the country.     Unfortunately,he is a physical and mental expression of the most narrow-mindedand bigoted section of the country.      In all circumstances great difficulties surround the path of the leader here, but Mr. de Valerais not a strong man and his many critics here know that fact well.Nothing is more characteristic than his tendency to surrender iways to the extremist view and to the extremist menace.However, before I left he said that patience was necessary,

things would move slowly but that they might move in time.     people would learn to realise what a German triumph would mean.     He was making a speech tomorrow in Galway and would see -what could besaid on that subject.(Signed)    J.L. MAFPEY.DUBLIN,10th May,   1940.

TELEGRAM FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM REPRESENTATIVE TO SIRETO THE SECRETARY OP STATE POP. DOMINION AFFAIRS.DATED 16th MAY,  IQhO.    RECEIVED 2.33 a.r.i.    l6th MAY,  19h0.IMMEDIATE-No.   11.   SECRET.Mr.   de Valera ashed me to see him at a late hoarto-night in order to tell me that in the light of theexperience of ho].land he viewed with great concern the prospectof similar contacts being male from Germany with the disaffectedelements in hire by ail1 or otherwise.      As is well known therehas been great delay in fulfilling the requirements of Eire in arms equipment and now he feels that the strengthening of thehands of the Government to face the new dangers is a matter of extreme urgency and also a matter of moment&apos; directly aifeetingthe interests of the United Kingdom.      I gather that machine guns are the foremost requirement but I am going into thequestion of details with the Defence Authorities here to-morrow.I have not failed to point cut the strain on our resources atthis time.      But I trust that the question of assisting thiscountry at this moment will be considered with full (corruptgroup) of the fact that it implies a move against a commonenemy and. the consequences of that are unpredictable.      I can hardly overstress the importance of doing all that is possible without delay.      In order to shew my sympathy withMr.   de Valerals difficulties I propose unless otherwiseinstructed to cross to London arriving Friday morning 17th.I can then report more fully on the conversation I have hadhere and can find, what can be done.      I will try and sendfurther compact details before I leave and I should be most grateful if preliminary steps could be taken by the dominions office to facilitate progress.
