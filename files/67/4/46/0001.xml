S E C RE T.W.P.(G)(40) 46.COPY NO.WAR CABINET,MAN-POV/ER.MEMORANDUM 3Y THE CHANCELLOR OFTHE EXCHEQUER.At the meeting of the War Cabinet on 18th January(W.M.(40) 17th Conclusions, Minute l), I was invited toexamine the question of man power in relation to supply in consultation with the Ministers concerned and to submit to the War Cabinet a plan showing the measures already inoperation and those proposed to deal with this urgentmatter.Immediately after the meeting of the War Cabinet, Iinitiated discussions between the Treasury and the Ministryof Labour, the Department primarily affected.     As theresult of those discussions and of correspondence betweenmyself and the Minister of Labour, matters have now reached a stage at which I am in a position to submit aProgress Report, so far as the Ministry of Labour isconcerned, in the form of the attached memorandum by theMinister.The Treasury are in consultation with the War Officand the Ministry of Supply on other aspects of the problem and, as soon as matters have sufficiently advanced, I will submit a further report.(Initialled)    J.S,Treasury Chambers,S.W.I.13th February, 1940.

MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR and national SERVICE.LABOUR SUPPLY - WAR PRODUCTION.1. It may be useful to present an interim progress reporton the action taken by the Ministry of Labour and NationalService arising out of the War Cabinet decision on 18thJanuary, .(\7.M.(.40) 17th Conclusions, Minute l).    The action taken may most conveniently be dealt with under two main headings, .namely:(i) The general question of labour supply and dilution,(ii) The question of training.The general question of labour suuply and dilution.2. The most important industry concerned is engineering.So far effort has been concentrated on that industry, but theMinistry is in consultation with the Admiralty about similar action in regard to the shipbuilding industry.3..        The actually existing shortages of labour in engineeringare principally in certain skilled grades.    Apart from this there cannot be said to be any extensive demands which arenot at present being satisfied as they materialise, though itmust be remembered that shortages of skilled labour,particularly in the tool-room, prevent other demands from becoming effective..   In certain cases, shortage of materialshas a similar effect..   Nevertheless there is evidence thatthe total personnel in engineering has increased largely since september..   The most urgent problem is to press on with arrangements for making the best use of the highly skilled men,, whose numbers cannot be increased in any short period oftime,.except to some small extent by attracting back toengineering men of this class who have migrated to otherindustries.    This introduces problems of dilution and upgradingwhich must be handled in detail within the industry.Within the next few months, if our programme is to berealised, there must be a great influx of new labour.

* s -&quot;4 0at present unskilled, into engineering.      The rate at which such labour can be absorbed will depend considerably on the degree of success with which the skilled labour problem ishandled.4. Following the meeting of the War Cabinet on 18thJanuary, I consulted the Heads of the Supply Departments and,in agreement with them, prepared a statement to be put beforethe national bodies representing the employers and employed inthe engineering industry.     This statement set out the extentof the increase in war production which would be required tocarry out the Governments plans, and contained full particulars of the estimates which had been framed of future labour requirements.     The memorandum invited both the employers andthe Trade Unions to consider the questions outlined in thememorandum as a matter of urgency and invited them to putforward their considered views and any concrete proposals withthe minimum of delay and with particular reference to thefollowing points:-(a) What measures are required to secure that theexisting supply of highly skilled workers is distributed and employed to the best advantage in the national interest?(b) Whether any and if so what measures s.re necessaryto speed up the application of the principlesembodied in the Relaxation of Customs Agreement?(c) Whether any further measures are necessary to ensurethe employment of suitable existing capacity uponwar production, bearing in mind the desirabilityof minimising the transfer of labour by employingit- where it is housed and of mailing use of existingmachine tools?.(d) Whether it would be desirable to expand thetraining facilities available in the government training Centres and if so, what form thatexpansion should take?(e) What steps has the Industry taken and what further steps is it prepared to take in thematter of training, and what suggestions hasit to make concerning assistance the government might give in this connection?

5. A series of meetings was then arranged at which,accompanied hy the Directors of Production of the three supply departments, I had preliminary discussions with the industry.On Pridaj/-, 2nd February, an interview with the EngineeringEmployers1 Federation took place and on Monday, 5th February,with the Amalgamated Engineering Union.     A meeting with the confederation of Engineering end Shipbuilding Trades Unions isto take place on Tuesday, 13th February.6. These meetings have be-an satisfactory and have revealedboth appreciation on the part of the industry of the confidenceplaced in thern and a willingness to do their utmost to assistthe Government in overcoming the difficulties which confront us.The employers were inclined to the view that the figures of future labour requirements were on the high side and pointed outthat if the estimates were correct the engineering industry would, by July, 1941, contain between a quarter and a third ofthe total insured population of the country.     The question ofthe further employment of women in munitions industry was not discussed at any length at these &quot;meetings, and the indicationsat present are that there is for the moment no great demand forwomen in engineering except in occupations in which they areordinarily employed.      Outside the engineering industry proper,e.g. for work in the national filling factories, women arealready being recruited through the Employment Exchanges insatisfactory numbers and no ruectim of conflict with theUnions is likely to arise.7. A certain amount of publicity was given to these mattershy the A.E.U. after the meeting on 5th February.     They made ahelpful statement to the Press and through the 3.B.C. indicating that they had been impressed with the magnitude of thetask and expressing the willingness of the Union to give full co-operation.     For the moment these statementshave helped the country to realise that the Government are

tackling this matter seriously, and it would, in my view heundesirable for members of the Government to say much on thesubject at the present time in public speeches.     The questionis obviously a delicate one, and while negotiations are inhand between myself and the two sides of the industry, itwould not be helpful if any me: her of the Government were tosay anything which might be interpreted as indicating thepossibility of pressure from outside.      There is no doubt thatthe best way to achieve results is to secure full co-operationof the industry, and the present indications are that suchco-operation will be forthcoming if negotiations are allowed totake their course.     Both sides realise the extreme urgency of the matter and there is no tendency to delay.8.      One of the objects to be aimed at is that the relaxation of Customs Agreement  .;ade between the A.S.U.and the Engineering Employers is utilised to the fullest extent.There is seme reason for thinking that Employers are not in allcases seeking to operate this agreement as fully as they might.The attitude of particular employers no doubt d.epends on howfull their order booh is and how hard, pressed they are for delivery;    and it is natural that Employers should hesitate to make proposals which may cause friction with their employees.Due allowance should be made for this,    but it is es entialthat full use should be   mad.e of the Agreement, and also that employers should put themselves to the temporary trouble andinconvience necessarily caused by organising their works soas to use all skilled labour to the best advantage.9.      On these and allied matters a stimulus from the ContractingDepartments is required though here again references in public speeches are undesirable.     The machinery for applying suchstimulus is through the Area Boards now being set up, andparticularly through Production Officers who are being appointed in each Region.

Training.10. If the expansion programmes are to he carried out therewill need to he a great increase not only of personnel hutof training in order to enable completely inexperiencedrecruits to the engineering industry to undertake thoir duties as well as to enable persons already in the industry toundertake more important duties to which they may have to be moved.      Speaking in broad terms,  training can be divided intoshort-term and long-term training, short-term training being that which is necessary to enable a completely raw recruit toundertake duties in the lower ranks of the industry, whilelong-term training is tnat which is necessary to produce a mancapable of undertaking semi-skilled work.      Short-term trainingwould last generally from a week or two to six or eight weeks,while long-term training is a matter of five or six months.11. Short-term training can best be undertaken in the factories themselves by the employers.      This is the most economical and quickest method of doing such training becausemethods of work vary from factory to factory and a man trainedfor a particular factory need only learn the methods of thatfactory.     Employers should also make every effort in the field of long-term training, but here the Ministry is prepared to supplement their efforts to a considerable extent by theexpansion of the existing training schemes.      It has to beborne in mind, however, that the present pressure on theindustry for production reduces the facilities for training.12. The Ministry&apos;s training scheme will shortly have some9,500 places available for training recruits for theengineering industry.      This would mean an output of about,000 men a month or some 25,000 a year.      Plans for expansionhave already been prepared to enable this number to be increasedby from 50% to 75% largely by a double shift system

and further expansions are contemplated.     The mainoccupations covered are machine operating (centre latheturning, milling, grinding, etc.), precision and aircraftfitting, sheet metal working, electric and oxy-welding,instrument making and draughtsmen.13. Up to the present admission to the Government TrainingCentres has been confined to the unemployed, and while thereare still so many men unemployed there is much to he said forconcentrating efforts on recruitment from among their ranks.At the present time an extensive campaign of recruitment forthe training centres is being conducted among the unemployed,and in some areas meetings are being arranged at whichrepresentatives of big engineering firms can interviewpotential recruits in order to explain the conditions and secure applications for training.     If this campaign showsthat unemployed in sufficient numbers cannot be recruited on present terms, it will be necessary to consider either raising the rate of allowances (particularly for married men) or possibly in the last resort a threat to withhold unemploymentbenefit.     In any case it may be necessary to consider theextension of training facilities at Government Centres to persons already in employment, though this would involvelargely increased allowances and other difficulties.14. The Ministry is also prepared to conduct short courses of training for instructors, and the Engineering Employers&apos;Federation have been informed in confidence that if theFederation so wish, the Ministry would by this means be willing to place at the disposal of the industry the trainingtechnique which they have acquired over the course of the lastfifteen years..15. It is not considered necessary at the present time toestablish training courses for women in the engineering tradessince women can best be employed in war time on simple

repetition processes which require very little training, andsuch training is of a type which is best left to employers.16.       The Ministry&apos;s standard course of training is for six months, but \uider pressure of industrial demand and by increasing the intensity of the course it has been possibleto reduce this period to an average of nineteen weeks.It is not considered, however, that there could safely beany further reduction as this would deprive the man of thenecessary general grounding.     As pointed out in paragraph11 above, short-term specific training is better given inthe employer1s own workshop.17.       3y agreement with the War Office 2,house places inthe Ministry1s centres have already been set aside for thetraining of serving soldiers as Army tradesmen, and theMinistry of Labour have indicated their willingness toincrease the number of such places if the War Office sorequest.     The Army require a somewhat less skilled type oftradesman than industry and the Ministry consider that theadditional needs of the &quot;War Office can best be met by theacquisition of additional premises with a less elaborateequipment (e.g. disused garage works) which would leave theexisting centres free for industrial training.18.       The Ministry are prepared to consider a further expansion of their training facilities should the need beproved.      Such expansion is, however, very costly and takesat least nine to twelve months before it could becomeproductive.     The Treasury do not at present feel that thereis sufficient jtistif publication for an expansion of theprogramme on a large scale but consideration is being givento the desirability of making advance purchases of machine tools which are the most difficult essential of a training centre to obtain.(Intd.)
