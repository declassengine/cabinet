this  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.COPY NO.   IJ)W.P.(G) (40)45.WARCABINET.LIABILITY FOR COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE OF BRITISH subjects in FRANCE AND FRENCH CITIZENS IN GREAT BRITAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Minister of Labour and National Service.1.     In the last war an agreement was made bet\7een the British and french governments imposing a mutual liability to military service on Britishsubjects in Franoe and upon French citizens in Great Britain, and effect wasgiven to the agreement in Great Britain by an Order in Council made underthe Military Service (Conventions with Allied States) Act, 1917.     There isno similar provision at present since British subjects outside Great Britairare not liable to be called up under the National Service (Armed Forces&apos;,and no steps have hitherto been taken to deal with French citizens inGreat Britain who fail to comply with their obligation to serve in theFrench Forces.2.     The Frenoh Government are anxious to conclude an agreement similar tothat in the last war for the duration of the present war.     It is obviouslyanomalous that, at a time when the two countries are so closely allied in the prosecution of war, a Frenchman should avoid being called up for service byliving in Great Britain and a British subject by living in France.     Suchcases are likely to cause a sense of grievance among the people of thecountries in question whose young men are being called to the colours andwould be particularly unfortunate in Franoe in view of the German propagandaalleging that Great Britain is prepared to fight to the last Frenchman.3.     It is suggested therefore that an agreement should be made with theFrench Government on the lines of that made in 1917, the main provisions ofwhioh would be as follows:-(l) The agreement would oover men between the ages of 18 and 41, whichare the age limits laid down, in the National Service (Armed FoiTJes)Aot.

(2) The agreement would apply to British subjects in Prance who ifthey returned to Great Britain would be liable  to be called up under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act.     Such men wouldbe given a month&apos;s grace during which they could return toGreat Britain, and if they did not take this opportunity theywould become liable to be called up for service in the french forces.(3) Similarly, French citizens of military age in Great Britain wouldbe given a month&apos;s grace during which they could return to Franceotherwise they would become liable to be called up for service inthe British Forces,(4) The British authorities would be prepared to arrange the returnto France of French citizens of military age who have arrived inGreat Britain since the outbreak of war.(5) Men with dual British and French nationality would be liable for service with the Forces of the country where they reside.4.     Authority is sought for the conclusion of an agreement upon theselines and for the preparation of legislation to give effect to it whenmade.(Initialled)   H.(Initialled)   E.B.8th February, 1940.H.Q.207-75 B.J.
