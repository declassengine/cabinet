Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 4.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE POLICY OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT IN REGARDTO PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I DID not have time,, before the meeting of the War Cabinet on the27th December, at which the memorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty on our Palestine policy (W.P. (G.) (39) 163) was considered, to set down anyobservations on that memorandum. Since, however, the consideration of that memorandum, and of the telegram of the 24th December to His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington (W.P. (G.) (39) 161) out of which it arose, has been postponed, I take the opportunity of circulating to my colleagues some reflexionswhich have occurred to me.2. I entirely agree that the attitude towards the Allies of both the UnitedStates of America and of the Jews of the world is a matter of the greatest importance to our prospects of ultimate victory, and that existing policies, howr-ever right they may seem in themselves, must not be pursued indiscriminatelyif those prospects are likely to be imperilled thereby.3. Moreover, I fully realise the strength of Zionist sentiment, which duringthe last few months has been made known to me, as doubtless to many of mycolleagues, by Dr. Weizmann and others. As recently as the 19th December, forinstance, Mr. Butler saw Dr. Weizmann just before the latter&apos;s departure forthe United States and just after he had received a letter from me (of which I attach a copy) explaining that the White Paper policy held the field. On this occasion Dr. Weizmann accepted my definition of the position of the league council and agreed as to the unconditional character of Jewish offers of support.But he made it plain that the Jews remained anxious and apprehensive, and saidthat it would be much better, in his view, for His Majesty&apos;s Government not topress ahead with any administrative acts necessary for the implementation ofthe White Paper policy, stressing, in particular, the danger of enforcingregulations about land sales.4. But, nevertheless, I feel that the policy advocated in the First Lord&apos;smemorandum raises serious difficulties. In the first place, I feel considerable doubt as to whether a declaration that His Majesty&apos;s Government must abide by the White Paper policy would, in fact, turn the&apos; Jews of the United Statesagainst us. It seems to me that if we are frank with them (and with the worldat large) there is at least a good chance that they will respond. But. in anycase, the Zionist leaders, just as much as His Majesty&apos;s Government, must take10804   [20582]
expediency into consideration, and in their case expediency demands that, how-ever strongly they may feel about Palestine, they should help the Allies to victory in.every way they can for the sake of their co-religionists in Central Europe.5. I also feel that even if the Jews of the United States of America didturn against us, this would not necessarily affect the attitude of the United states as a whole. I do not think their influence is in any sense decisive. It has evenbeen suggested that support for the Allies from American Jewry, if too evident,would defeat its own object, by suggesting to the American public that the Jewswere trying to get the United States into the war. This may be an exaggeration,but I should not have said myself that the position now was comparable to thatof November 1917.6. Even assuming, however, that on grounds of expediency it would be unwise to tell the American Zionists that we adhered to the White Paper policy,it must be remembered that on grounds of expediency it would also be unwise totell the Arabs that we did not propose to adhere to it. It might even becatastrophic.7. The Middle East is at present remarkably, and rather unexpectedly, quiet,and, on the whole, pro-Ally in sentiment. This is largely the result of theWhite Paper, which in essentials meets all reasonable Arab claims, howeverinadequate it may seem to Arab politicians in points of detail. But if the Arabsare told that they can no longer rely on obtaining even what the White Paperoffers them, and that the door is again open to the possibility at least of unlimitedJewish immigration, the whole basis of this happy state of affairs will disappear,and the Middle East will become a fertile ground for trouble and intrigue ofevery kind, with all belief in British good faith and British good intentions gonefor ever.8. Just as I have deprecated undue insistence on the dangers of Zionistresentment, so I do not wish to over-state the dangers of Arab resentment. TheArabs may want independence, but they do not want merely to exchange masters.Although all things are possible, I do not suppose that, if we went back on theWhite Paper policy, Egypt and Iraq would instantly denounce the alliances.Nor do I suppose that rebellions would necessarily break out at once in palestine and elsewhere, and. if they did, our forces might be able to suppress them. ButI do suggest that, if it is a question of balancing dangers, the Arab danger is as great as the Zionist danger and, from a purely geographical point of view,the more serious of the two.9. I am aware that what the First Lord&apos;s memorandum actually recommendsis not that we should say that we had abandoned the White Paper policy, butthat we should say that, while we are not prepared now to take a new view ofthat policy, we recognise that Palestine is a question which must find its place inthe general peace settlement at the end of the war, and that, meanwhile, nothing would be done to prejudice the final form which that settlement would take.This could only be construed by the American Zionists as an assurance that,while His Majesty&apos;s Government might have made no promises, they neverthelessdid not rule out the possibility of the Jews getting better terms in the peace settle-ment than in the White Paper.10. But if we say, or even imply, this to the Zionists, we must also say, or at least imply, to the Arabs that, while we make no promises, we neverthelessdo not rule out the possibility that the Arabs might get better terms in the peace settlement than in the White Paper. To say less than this would, as a matter of tactics, be fatal.11. Yet I can imagine that the only result of such declarations would be to let loose from both sides a flood of demands, appeals and even threats, supportedby campaigns in Parliament and the press of this country, which would last untilthe time came for the peace settlement; and that, the final settlement itself,whatever it might be, would inevitably lead to renewed charges of ill-faith fromat least one side, and possibly from both.12. As regards the Parliamentary aspect, I should regard as deplorableanything which divided Parliament or the country at this time. But thePalestine problem will go on existing whatever we may try to do about it, and
attempts to postpone it may merely produce the very controversy we wish to avoid.This seems to me a case where, having once adopted our policy, it will pay us far better, even on a short view, to stick to it, and, if necessary, explain and defendit, rather than to create doubt and confusion by abandoning it.13. In saying this, I realise that, whatever we may do now, our policy maynever be carried out. Special circumstances may arise; it may be repudiated bya future Government, or it may be submerged in a world cataclysm. But, all thesame, I am sure that our best course, and even the fairest course to the Jews, isto adhere to it until the cataclysm comes, and while we ourselves remain in office.Nobody can legislate for cataclysms, and, if there is no cataclysm, I doubt whether any future Government, whatever its composition and sympathies, will be able,to do much more for the Jews than is offered them in the White Paper. It might find this out when faced with the responsibility of office and accept the factswithout experiment. If it insisted on experimenting, it would soon find itselftreading the path of the last twenty years and inevitably forced by Arabopposition to adopt a compromise very like the one it had rejected.14. In conclusion, I fear that the sacrifice called for in the last paragraphof the memorandum would be made not by this country, but by the Arabs ofPalestine, and not by them alone. The Jews also would suffer. Can we not winour fight without condemning Palestine to further bloodshed and misery?Moreover, the Arabs have always maintained that, if Great Britain made incon-venient promises to the Zionists during the last war, she should make thesepromises good at her own expense and in her own territory, and not at theexpense and in the territory of the Arabs. None of us wishes to imperil our hopes of victory, but, apart from any doubt as to whether adherence to the White Paperpolicy will do this, Arab feeling (to which must be added Moslem feelingthroughout the world) is not a minor obstacle, but a very formidable obstacleindeed.15. For all these reasons, I hope my colleagues will agree that the instruc-tions contained in the draft telegram of the 24th December to Lord Lothian shallsubstantially stand, subject to the addition (as decided at our meeting on the27th December) of details about the technical aspects of immigration and landsales.16. As regards this particular question of land sales, we may await thememorandum on this subject which the Colonial Secretary will shortly circulate.All I wish to say here is that it is to be remembered that the White Paper hasnot been submitted to the Council of the League. Without prejudice to our viewthat such a submission is not strictly necessary, it is reasonably to be expectedthat, unless the League should disappear from the field, the White Paper willhave to be so submitted some day. An atmosphere of truce has meanwhile been created which it is obviously most undesirable to break if it can possibly be avoided. On the one hand, I should judge it to be imperative to maintain ourposition on principle, in order to avoid confusion arising on both sides as toBritish policy, with all the consequences that are all too familiar. On the other, Iam sure the Colonial Secretary will not wish by any lack of admissible elasticityin administration to run into unnecessary trouble. I should not have thought it ought to be impossible to keep in the middle of the road.17. Similarly, I am quite content that Lord Lothian should stress thedesirability of a Jewish-Arab understanding before the ten years of the white paper policy are over (see his telegram of the 27th December(&apos;)). I am alsocontent that any explanations to the American Zionists should be phrased in asconciliatory a manner as possible. Lord Lothian might be given full discretionon these points.18. But the essence of the explanation must remain and an explanation of some kind is inevitable, if not now, then very shortly, in reply to one or another of the constant Jewish and Arab enquiries and, unless the explanation isunequivocal, we shall again buoy up the Jews with hopes which have no realprospect of fulfilment.H.Foreign Office, January 1940.(l) a copy is printed below for convenience.

Viscount Halifax to Dr. Weizmann.Dear Dr. Weizmann, Foreign Office, December 19, 1939.SINCE we had our talk at the Foreign Office on the 30th November, I havegiven further thought to the letter which you left with me, and I have taken theopportunity of discussing with others the matters at issue.As I have already told you, I have no authority to discuss with you the affairs of Palestine, which are outside my province, nor is my acquaintance withsuch questions sufficiently close and continuous to enable me to reply in detail to the various points raised in your letter. Writing, however, as a member ofthe Cabinet which was collectively responsible for the recent White Paper on palestine policy, I may perhaps venture to give you my opinion on the broaderaspect of the question as I see it.In the first place, may I remind you that the policy embodied in the white paper was adopted by the Cabinet, after long and anxious deliberation, as themost equitable solution of a bitter controversy and as the only course which wouldenable us to fulfil in equal measure our Mandatory obligations to Jews and Arabs.In the circumstances, it seems clear to me that it is not possible to modify orpostpone the application of the White Paper policy in favour of one communitywithout doing an injustice to the other. This strikes me as a governingconsideration.The policy of the White Paper became effective as soon as it had beenapproved by Parliament and. as you know, our attitude is that, as that policydoes not involve any amendment of the Mandate, it does not require the prior approval of the League Council. Neither before the war nor since has theGovernment said or done anything to justify the assumption that implementation of the policy would be deferred either because it has not yet been approved by theLeague Council or on account of the war situation.In conclusion, let me assure you that I am the last to underrate the value of jewish sympathy and co-operation with the Allied war effort. But. highly asHis Majesty&apos;s Government appreciated Jewish offers of assistance on the outbreakof war, it must not be overlooked that those offers were made unconditionally andwere welcomed on that footing. So far as this country is concerned, we are putting our whole energy into a life-and-death struggle with Nazi Germany, thepersecutor of Jewry in Central Europe, and by ridding Europe of the presentGerman regime we hope to render a supreme service to the Jewish people.Yours sincerely,HALIFAX.ANNEX II.The Marquess of Lothian to Viscount Halifax. (Received December 28.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, December 27, 1939.YOUR telegram No. 943 and-your telegram iS,o. 948.I have been asked to attend a dinner which the United Palestine Appeal isgiving to Weizmann on 7th January, and to give a word of greeting to theAmerican Jewish leaders from every section of the United States. If you thinkit advisable, I could either attend or send a message saying (1) that the white paper is the settled policy of the British Government; (2) the final solution of thePalestine question is only possible by agreement between the Arabs and the Jews;(3) that His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly hope that such agreement will havebeen reached before the seven(2) years is up. I am not sure that it is a good thingfor me to speak in public at a Zionist gathering at present, and it may be better that 1 should ask Weizmann and other leaders to come and see me privately when can talk to them on the general lines of your telegrams. I should be glad of anearly expression of your views.(3) &apos;;&apos; Ten years &quot; is presumably meant.ANNEX I.
