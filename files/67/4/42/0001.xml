COPY NO.  -&apos;V/AR     CABINET.THE SHIPPING SITUATION IK RELATION TO THE SUPPLY PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping.1. Now that exact information is available as to our importsup to the end of last year, I think it well to circulate ageneral note as to the shipping situation in relation to theSupply Programme.I have circulated separately an analysis of the employment-of British shipping at the end of December, 1939 and similarreturns will be available monthly in future.2c On the 15th November (wr.P.(G) 39 (89)) I estimated that]upon the assumption of no increase of losses or delays or extrawithdrawals of merchant ships for military and naval purposes,our total imports (excluding oil) in both British and foreignvessels for the first year of the war might amount to:-47 million tons.3.    I now enclose a review of this estimate bySir William Elderton in the light of the experience of the first four months.    The most important features of the resultingpicture are summarised in the following paragraphs.4. In the first four months our actual imports totalled12.9 million tons, of which 9.65 million came in British ships and 3.25 million tons in foreign ships, i0e. the imports were atthe rate, not of 47 million tons per annum, but 38,7 million tons.The 47 million tons estimate was, however, based upon ananticipation of a gradual increase in the monthly rate of importation, from 3.5 million for the period November-January,4.15 million February-April, and 4.75 million May-August.

It is to be noted that the estimate of November 15th wasmade just before the beginning of the magnetic mine campaign,which, apart from the actual loss of cargoes sunk, has made it more difficult to induce neutral ships to bring imports to thiscountry.There are, however, several reasons to hope that, in theabsence of untoward developments, the rate of importation wouldbe substantially above the average for the first four months.Some of the fall at the beginning of the war was due to temporary causes which will not operate throughout the year.Spring and Summer weather will help;    and we have made extensivearrangements to charter neutral tonnage (especially Greek and norwegian).It is, however, evident that we cannot in any circumstanceshope to exceed the total of 47 million tons figure, and that wemay fall far below it as a result of factors y/hich are not noweasily calculable;    in particular the future development of hostile action against shipping, demands for the withdrawal of manyadditional merchant ships from importing work for military and naval purposes, of which we have already had indication, and the increasing reluctance of neutral ships to come to our shores.It would therefore he obviously imprudent to plan supplyprogrammes on the basis of 47 million tons being available forconsumption.    In certain not improbable circumstances this figuremight v/ell he- reduced by 10% and possibly more.5.    The basis upon which the above estimate of importing capacity is made, which is described more fully in the Appendix,may be shortly summarised as follows:-&quot;We have at present about 9.8 million tons of british shipping available for bringing imports into the United Kingdomand Prance.   Provisionally, we allowed 350,000 tons for Prance,while pointing out that this was a low figure.   We must expect that it will be necessary to secure that Prance1s tonnage is

substantially supplemented partly by British ships and partly by a generous allocation of neutral tonnage at our jointdisposal.    The 9^ million tons left have a carrying capacity ofabout 10.6 million tons.    In addition there are some 670,000tons of British shipping engaged in the regular trade with theEmpire and elsewhere.    Of this an increasing proportion will bebrought to the United Kingdom, but the process is both costly andslow, and its effect can only be partially reflected in theimports of the first year.   We shall in addition get some imports in small vessels not included in the above figures.    On the otherhand, we have to allow for the employment of some of the largertonnage in coastwise, not importing, trade and for losses ofimports, as a result of enemy losses, marine losses and damage.As a net result - even assuming no increase in the scale of losses - we are unlikely to bring in more than 34 million tons inBritish ships.As regards neutral tonnage, for which estimates are still less certain, it would be optimistic to expect it to bring inthe remaining 13 million tons required to make up the total of47 million.6.    In these circumstances it might be justifiable to retainfor the present the provisional allocations of tonnage to whichthe Ministry of Shipping has been working for the Ministry ofFood and the Ministry of Supply (19.8 million tons for the formerand 23.9 million tons for the latter;    made on the basis of atotal of 47 million tons covering miscellaneous items not included in the programmes of these Departments).Since those provisional allocations were made, however,the Ministry of Shipping has been informed that for politicaland exchange reasons, the purchase of a large proportion of ourimoorts from more distant sources is being contemplated (e.g.wheat from Australia instead of Canada and timber from Canada

instead of Scandinavia).    The result might well he to reduce our total imports by some million tons, perhaps 1-g- million tonsin the rest of this first year and some 4 million tons for afull year.Even apart from any such damage, we must prudently allow for a possible reduction of imports through increased hostile action, etc.    I would strongly urge, therefore, that theDepartments, in planning their programmes of importation and allocation, should arrange for consumption on a basis which is less than that of the provisional figures by at least 10^?., andif possible by a larger proportion, so that if, as is probable,importations fall substantially below the provisional figures,there may be no diminution in essential stocks, and if theimportations for a time approach those figures, such stocks maybe increased against the hazards of the future.Difficult as it may be to reduce consumption to this extent, the results of a carefully planned restriction enforcedand controlled before stocks have run down are likely to bemuch less    serious than the sudden immobilization of industries which would result from allocations on a more generous basis if our importing capacity is reduced.J.G.Ministry of Shipping.7th February, 1940.

AHNEX.Shipping - Analysis of Importing Capacity.Note hy Sir William Elderton.I have now reassessed the importing capacity of british shipping in the light of further information which has become available since my note of the 15th November, 1939.    It isnecessary to deal first with two adjustments that must be made tomy previous estimate.First, I mentioned in my previous note that on the informationthen available the combined net loss of imports during the year as a result of (a) enemy action, marine losses, damage, etc. lessnew building, etc., and (b) vessels of 1600 gross tons and overbeing utilised wholly or partly for coastwise traffic appeared tobe approximately equal to (c) the imports which would be broughtto this country in the period by vessels of under 1600 gross   tons;and that in consequence of this I had set off the one against theother.    I have now come to the conclusion that item (a) above should be assessed   at 2,000,000 tons of goods for the first year of the war and item (b) at 750,000 tons,  or 2,750,000 tonstogether.   As regards item (c), the imports in vessels under1600 gross tons are by no means easy to assess.    The amount oftonnage of this class appears at first sight to be sufficient to import substantially more than 2,750,000 tons but much of it is used to export coal from this country to France and elsewhere.Our exports of coal much exceed the imports which we can obtain from the countries concerned and, in consequence, there must be anumber of return ballast voyages.    In these circumstances itwould be incorrect to assume that these small vessels can be fully employed in importing.    On such information as is available Iestimate that the imports brought by these vessels are likely tobe between 2 to 2-g- million tons during the first year of the war.It thus appears that the losses of imports mentioned at (a) and(b) above will probably exceed the imports brought by small

vessels, and that the extent of the excess may he about500,000 tons, the reduction for the period from January to august being about 300,000 tons.   My earlier estimate of our imports, therefore, requires to be reduced to allow for this item.Secondly, at the time when my previous estimate v/as madethe amount of tonnage of vessels other than Tankers of over 1600gross tons allocated to the Fighting Services was 1,760,000 grosstons but I adopted a figure of 1,940,000 gross tons to make provision for future requirements.    By the 29th November thetonnage allocated to the Services v/as 2,010,000 gross tons, andby the 31st December last the figure had risen to 2,116,000 grosstons.    The continuous use by the Services of 176,000 gross tonsof shipping in excess of the 1,940,000 tons allowed for in myNovember estimate will result in a reduction in our imports during the remainder of the first year of the war of about400,000 tons.    The combined effect of these two adjustments isa reduction of 700,000 tons in my estimate of our importing capacity during the period to 31st August-next.The imports (other than oil) during September and Octoberrecorded in the Trade and Navigation Accounts were a little inexcess of 6.1 million tons but this includes items which arrived in August but were not included in these accounts for that month;    and in considering imports for the first year of thewar an adjustment should be made of about half a million tons onthis account, thus reducing the figure to about 5.6 million tons.In addition, during the early months of the war a part of theimports consisted of non-essential commodities not related to a reduced programme of essential war needs, but no adjustment ismade for this.    The November and December imports which were7.3 million tons show a decided improvement as compared withthe preceding two months and indicate the first results of the steps which have already been taken in the short period since

the outbreak of war.    Thus the total imports, apart from oil,during the first four months of the war amounted to 12.9 million tons, including commodities seized by the Contraband control which have been included in the Trade and Navigation Accounts.I estimated in my previous note that, in November last,the available British tonnage for importing to the United kingdom was about 9,800 million gross tons, less 350,000 tons requiredfor French imports.    The net deadweight capacity of this tonnage,after deducting (a) bunkers and (b) dunnage, measurement (light)cargoes, cargo discharged en route, difference between summer and winter marks, etc., based on the experience of currentcommercial operations, is about 10.6 million tons made up asfollows:-Thousand tons.Gross tonnage of vessels 9,817Less vessels allocated to France 5509,467Deadweight capacity 13,190Less (a) Bunkers 1,290(b) Other allowances 1,250 2,54010,650say 10,600I also indicated that during the last 10 months of the first year of war, British vessels would import 31 million tons.During the last two months they have imported about 5.8 million tons leaving a balance for the period January to August of25.2 million tons.    Incorporating the adjustment mentioned earlierthe figure becomes 24-g- million tons.Since the preparation of my estimate I have been informedthat political and exchange considerations will necessitatecertain commodities (notably wheat and timber) being purchased,in more distant countries than was originally contemplated.    It is

364impracticable for me at the moment to recompute my estimate toallow for this point for the reason that the programmes of theSupply Departments are. by no means complete.   But on suchindications as have been given to me it seems probable that ifthe new proposals are adopted my estimate of the amount ofimports which can be brought in British vessels in the period to August next would recpiire to be reduced from the 24^- million tons mentioned above to 23 million tons.    The corresponding reduction in imports on this account in a year when there-arrangement was fully in operation would be substantially more and might amount to as much as 4 million tons.In my estimates I have made only a slight allowance for afurther improvement in our imports in January and February ascompared with November and December because they are winter months and because February will have only twenty nine days.I expect, however, that there will be a substantial increase inour rate of importing in the summer months which, however,cannot be expected to continue during next winter not   only onaccount of the season, but also because of the cumulative effectof losses.As regards imports in foreign vessels, I stated that if wewere to import 47 million tons in the first year of the warthese vessels would have to carry 11 million tons of our imports during the then remaining ten months of the year.    On the basisof the information now available, I estimate that in the first four months they carried about 34. million tons, of which about1-g- million tons arrived in November and December.    This leavesa balance of 9-g- million tons for the period January to August1940.   A computation based merely on the amount of tonnage forwhich charters have already been arranged would underestimate theposition   for the reason that foreign shipowners will trade with us apart from any chartering agreements if they can obtainattractive freights.    The mere taking over or chartering of

o a ktonnage for United Kingdom &quot;work does not result in a gain in imports unless the total amount of tonnage engaged on our behalfis thereby increased.    So far as foreign tonnage already working for us is concerned, chartering by us will not, of itself,increase to any substantial extent the amount of imports broughtto the United Kingdom in foreign vessels;    the advantage lies in control.The imports brought in foreign vessels have been less thananticipated and if my estimate of 11 million tons of imports insuch vessels during the last ten months of the first year of thewar is to be realized, it will be necessary that the rate of importing in these vessels in the period January to August shouldbe increased by over 40 per cent above the rate for the periodSeptember to December.W* E *7th February, 1940.
