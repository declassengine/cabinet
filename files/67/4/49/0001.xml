fcC RET.3.fG)(40) 49.COPY NO,WAR CABINET.MAN POWER.Memorandum, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.With reference to my memorandum dated the 13thFebruary, W,P.(G)(40) 46, and to the decisions of theWar Cabinet on 18th January (W.M.(40) 17th Conclusions,Minute l), I circulate herewith a note prepared in theWar Office (Appendix A), and agreed with the Ministry ofLabour, on the employment of skilled tradesmen in theArmy, and also a note by the Ministry of Supply (AppendixB) on the steps which have been taken by that Departmentto deal with the labour problem,,(initialled)    J.S.Treasury Chambers, S,W.1.17th February, 1940,

MEMORANDUM BY THE WAR OFFICE ONTHE EMPLOYMENT OF SKILLED TRADESMENIN THE ARMY.1. In peace the Regular Army trained most of itstradesmen as hoys to complete its requirements and theTerritorial Army had perforce to rely on tradesmenproduced from industry,      The technical units of theTerritorial Army were, in proportion to other arms, fewin number and were maintained at a low establishment.The &quot;doubling&quot; of the Territorial Army in March, 1939,did not simplify matters as certain technical units werenot doubled.Even in the Regular Army the number of technicalunits was inadequate for the new plan and was being increased during 1939.2. In fulfilment of a pledge given by the Secretaryof State for War in 1936, the machinery for a comb-out ofthe Territorial Field Army after embodiment, with a viewto releasing certain highly skilled men to industry, wasworked out between the War Office and Ministry of Labour.The scope of the comb-out, which was finally approved by the Man-Power (Technical) Committee on 27thMarch, 1939, was that &quot;Private soldiers whose occupationwas reserved at 18, 21, or 23, who were at or above theage of reservation, should be returned to Industry unlessactually employed in their units in a correspondingmilitary trade&quot;0     The comb-out was started early inSeptember 1939, and as a result, some 8,000 men were returned to industry.      Additional releases were grantedat the instance of other Government Departments and up tothe end of January, 1940, indefinite release had beengranted to a total of some 400 officers and 13,000 other ranks, and temporary release to a further 100 officers and13,000 other ranks.

3. A number of tradesmen in the Territorial Army-did not fall within the terms of the comb-out either because they were under the age of reservation for their occupation or because their occupation is reserved at an age above 23.     Further there were certain Army Reservistsbelonging to non-technical arms who learnt a trade ontheir return to civil life.     Every effort is being madeto adjust the available tradesmen resources within theArmy to the best advantage.A card-index of tradesmen shown to be surplus tothe establishment of T.A, Field Army Units has beencompiled from the forms used in connection with thecomb-out of this Force.      This is now nearing completion -18,500 names have so far been recorded in the card-index.Over 7,000 transfers have already been carried out orordered, comprising the bulk of those listed as belongingto the engineering and metal trades,      The process will becontinued until all useful transfers which can be madehave been completed^In this connection careful note is taken ofinformation as to individual skill supplied to the WarOffice by responsible authorities such as the amalgamated engineering Union,h. A comprehensive scheme for transferring to a useful capacity tradesmen who are surplus to their unitsestablishment overseas has been launched in the british expeditionary Force,.,     This should find out thoseRegular Reservists who have learnt a trade in civil life and also pick up those surplus Territorial Army tradesmenwho were not transferred into a trade vacancy before proceeding overseas,      G.R.O. on the subject is attached.-

5. It is important to notice that only a proportionof the tradesmen figuring on the card index can heusefully transferred.      Some are specialists in theirown units, whilst many belong to such trades ascarpenter, baker etc. of which there is at present noshortage, although these men are available for latertransfers should the need arise.6.         Finally a comb-out of the Anti-Aircraft andCoast Defence Units of the Territorial Army is nowin progress.     This will result in the return of anumber of men belonging to some of the occupations off first importance to industry and in the discovery of asubstantial number of othex^s who could be more profitablyemployed as tradesmen in another arm.     These men willbe -card-indexed-suoa. to?axisferred..9-c -^eaui-^JScL-______

EXTRACT FROM GENERAL ROUTINE ORDERS NO.  63BY TIIE COM;.AND3R-IN-CHIEF, BRITISH EXPEDITIONARY FORCE.1. In view of the great importance of using skilledtradesmen in the work for which they have been trained incivil life or in the Army, and in view of the fact thatthe Ministry of Labour will not make tradesmen availablefor enlistment in the Services unless satisfied that thelatter are making proper use of the tradesmen they already have, steps will be taken immediately on the following-lines to ensure that tradesmen are employed at their owner a cognate trade.2. Every unit commander will cause the A.L.6h of eachN.C.O. and man to be inspected, and where the &quot;trade onenlistment&quot; shown thereon is different from that in whichthe N.C.O. or man is actually employed, he will act asfollows unless the N.C.O. or man is employed in anothertrade at which he is fully proficient:-(a) If the &quot;trade on enlistment&quot; or a cognate tradeexists in the War Establishment of the unit and there is a vacancy in the trade, he willpost the N.C.O. or man to fill the vacancy,(b) If the &quot;trade on enlistment&quot; or a cognate tradedoes not exist in the War Establishment of the unit, or if there is no vacancy in the tradein the unit, lie will forward the name of theN.C.O. and man with particulars of his tradeto the Officer i/c 2nd Echelon.3. After the review of A.B.S. 6h has been made, the unit commander will report to his immediate superior thatit has been completed, either adding that there are no -tradesmen in the unit not employed at their &quot;trade onenlistment&quot;, a cognate trade or another trade in which theyare fully proficient, or stating the numbers by trades

who cannot he so employed.     These numbers will be reported, by units and by trades, through the usual channels to G.H.Q. 1st Echelon, ::A&quot; Branch.L. Any Regular N.C.O. or soldier who has beentaught a trade since joining the Army or who hasundergone a vocational training course in an Army trade on transfer to the Reserve, and who is not being employed at that trade, will also be dealt with as laiddown in para.2 and be included in the figures forwardedunder para.3.5. The A.B.s.6h of all N.C.O,s and. men subsequentlyjoining the unit as drafts will be examined and action taken as laid down in paras.2 and 3-      The Officer i/c2nd Echelon will make every endeavour to post tradesmento those units only in v/hich there are vacancies intheir trades and it is the responsibility of unitcommanders to ensure that they are employed in theirtrades on arrival.6. In order to help units which have no copy ofTradesmen&apos;s Regulations, a list of Army trades isattached as Appendix B to this G.R.O.7. On receipt of the particulars required by para.2(b) the Officer i/c 2nd Echelon will attach N.C.Ofsand men unemployed at their trade in their own units toother units which show deficiencies in the trades concerned on their A.Ps. W.3009.     After an attachment forone month on probation the O.G. unit to which suchN.C.O&apos;s and men are attached, will report to Officeri/c 2nd Echelon whether they are qualified to bemustered as tradesmen.

APPENDIX 3.MEMORANDUM. -3Y TEE MINISTRY OP SUPPLY.The following action has heen taken by the Ministryof Supply on the War Cabinet decision of 18th January(W.M.(hO) 17th Conclusions Minute l).The Ministry collaborated with the Ministry of labour in preparing a statement on the labour position and re-quirements for the national bodies representing employersand employed in the engineering industry, and the director general of Munitions Production has attended the ire etingswhich the Ministen of Labour has had with these bodies.The question of the Production Officers to deal withMan-power problems has been under active discussion with theAdmiralty and the Air Ministry.      The original suggestion to have Officers responsible to the Area Boards and servingall the three Supply Departments has been reconsidered andit has been decided,  in deference to the views of the otherDepartments,  that their man-power problems shall be dealtwith by their own Production Officers.      The Ministry ofSupply on its side will appoint Production Officers in each area who will co-operate with managements to bring aboutthe utmost use of the skilled personnel in its ContractorsEstablishments,     The services of these Officers will be available to the other Departments if they so desire.Authority for the appointment of a Production Officer f .-*each area is being sought from the Treasury at the moment and the Central Register oftho Ministry of Labour and national Service has provided the names of some candidateswho will shortly be interviewed.In the meantime, in regard to the machine tool industry,the Controller of Machine Tools has detached a member ofhis staff to approach manufacturers with a view to securingsuch measures of dilution as is possible, so that night

shifts may he started.     Some measure of success liasalready been achieved.vVith regard to sub-contracting it is the policy ofthe ministry of Supply to make   use of this to the greatest possible extent and every endeavour is being made to thisend   through Chambers of Commerce;, the Federation of BritishIndustries; and the Ministry&apos;s Area Officers, all of who mare endeavouring to place small firms seeking work in touchwith main contractors.     It is also the intention to make use of the Area Advisory Committees and the Area Boards inspreading war production, over a wider field.The proposal that steps should be taken to ensurethat engineering labour shall be employed only on purposesdirectly connected with the war effort is more difficult,since the employment of the very small engineering firmson the economical production of modern munitions presentsalmost insuperable problems.     Many of these firms are pressing to he given Government work but, apart from sub-contracting,  it is not easy to make effective use of them.It is hoped that in some cases they can be given simplework on components and that in other cases their plantsmay be grouped so as to enable them to undertake the manu-facture of complete munition stores.     The Area Boards and advisory Committees which are now being set up will be requested to give special attention to this problem.      it involves inducing firms to agree to the pooling of plant and labour into units large enough to justify the provisionof the necessary balancing plant, and firms are not tooready to agree to this course..
