SECRET. CoPy No-W.P. (G.) (40) 30.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, a semi-official letterfrom His Majesty \s Ambassador in Washington on the subject of Anglo-american relations.H.Foreign Office, February 12, 1940.The Marquess of Lothian to Viscount Bali fax.My dear Halifax, Washington. January 27. 1940.I HAVE tried to give you a full account by telegram of the recent minor&quot; crisis &quot; in Anglo-American relations. I doir t propose to repeat in this letterwhat I said there. It is, however, important that you should realise that the&quot;crisis&quot; marks a permanent change in the American attitude. Hitherto, notonly has the sentiment in the United States and the Administration beenoverwhelmingly anti-Hitler, and therefore pro-Ally, but it has been dominated by a somewhat humiliating desire to escape the risk of war at almost any price,so that it abandoned its historic rights at sea in the cash-and-carry legislation and has been willing to acquiesce in almost any belligerent action except alongits own shores if resistance seemed likely to lead it towards war. We need not feel too condemnatory about this pusillanimity because we were charged with much the same thing during the Spanish Civil War and over Austria and Czecho-Slovakia.The United States is now beginning to pass out of this phase. It no longerfears that it is going to be dragged into the European war unless the defeat of britain at sea confronts it with an entirely new situation. It is making up itsmind to go into the front line in the Far East, and, while I don&apos;t think that it means to provoke Japan by anything like an embargo, I believe public opinionwill support a resolute defence of American rights there, continued assistanceto China and steady economic pressure on Japan to return towards the Nine-Powertreaties.The recent flare up against us does not mean that either the Administrationor public opinion has diminished in the least its strong desire that we should win the war, or has created any sentiment in favour of insisting on American rights10878   [20812]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.

to a point of crippling in any way our effort. It is clue partly to the feeling thatwe have been needlessly inconsiderate of American interests both private andpublic; that we have been trading upon her good will and. more importantperhaps in the long run, the U.S.A. is beginning to feel the old i natationagainst the way we use our &quot; command of the seas,&quot; which has been the constant source of often unreasonable protest to us for the last hundred years.The United States feels acutely that she is now a sea power equal to ourselves,and must be treated with the consideration due to this power. She knows, too,that, if she chooses to put down her foot by threatening retaliation, she can probably compel us. I think, therefore, that you must face the fact that theperiod of easy going we have enjoyed over here in the past has come to an end,and that the United States, while anxious to do nothing to impede our war effort,will assert itself a good deal more vigorously and will expect to be consulted agood deal more about our policy on all matters which affect her trade and interests. The essence of the case is this. We have got to prove to the US.A.,which includes public opinion as well as the Administration, that any action we take affecting them is really necessary for the winning of the war. once that is established, there Avill be no more difficulty. But we shall, in future,have to prove our case and not just impose restrictions and expect the U.S.A.to acquiesce. It&apos;s not going to be easy to do this and I am sending you a despatch next week about the whole problem. Our position is in some waysmore difficult than in the last war. because the Neutrality Act has eliminatedcounter-friction with the Germans. There is nothing to worry about at present.There is no diminution in the general desh&apos;e to help us to win the war by all means that do not draw the U.S.A. towards involvement. But, as foreign secretary, you ought, I think, to realise that there are now latent dangers onthis side which hitherto have not appeared above the horizon.Yours. &amp;c.LOTHIAN.
