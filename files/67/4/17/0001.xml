a- 200Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.SECRET. Copy No.   j gW.P. (G.) (40) 17.WAR CABINET.PALESTINE.Illegal Jewish Military Organisation.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.ON the 5th October a detachment of the Transjordan Frontier Force surprisedand surrounded 43 armed and uniformed Jews moving in military formation.The Jews were put on trial before a military court and were found guilty ofcarrying firearms and ammunition in contravention of the Defence Regulations.One was sentenced to imprisonment for life and each of the others to ten years&apos;imprisonment. These sentences were reduced on review by the General OfficerCommanding to ten years and five years respectively. On the 18th November38 Jews (including 4 temporary Jewish police constables armed with their Govern-ment rifles) were arrested by the Police in the Safad sub-district while marching in military formation. Near the spot where the party was arrested, and in Jewishhouses in the neighbourhood, the Police seized a haversack containing 27 sticksof gelignite, materials for land mines, including 14 detonators, an automaticpistol, two automatic rifles, a parabellum pistol and other weapons; also manualsof training and firearm instruction with other documents connecting the partywith the Irgun Tzvai Leumi (the Revisionist military organization). Themembers of the band were tried, convicted and sentenced to terms of imprison-ment varying from ten to two years by a military court under the emergency regulations. On the 21st November soldiers and police searched the premises ofa Jewish temporary police corporal at Telzuq and found a pistol, a revolver,100 rounds of ammunition and 10 bombs with detonators.2. These incidents have drawn public attention to the existence in Palestineof a clandestine Jewish military organisation. Information pointing to theexistence of this organisation had been in possession of the Government ofPalestine for many years but, owing no doubt to the heavy penalties by whichJewish members of the organisation are bound to secrecy, no evidence amountingto proof had hitherto been obtained.3. The High Commissioner for Palestine, in consultation with the GeneralOfficer Commanding, has had under his consideration the question of the courseof action that should now be adopted. Both are satisfied that the existence ofthis illegal organisation can no longer be ignored. The General Officer Com-manding, from whose conclusions the High Commissioner does not dissent, holdsthat the object of this organisation is the formation of a Jewish army in Palestine;that it is in no way an outcome of the present war, and that the object of theJewish army would be to secure eventual Jewish military supremacy in Palestine.He apprehends that this Jewish army, though primarily designed for use againstthe Arabs, might even be used in certain circumstances against the British forcesin Palestine.4.   The General Officer Commanding propounds two alternatives(a) To try the effect of a protest and to endeavour to obtain promises of betterbehaviour from the Jewish leaders.  He can attach little value to suchpromises.[20670]
(6) To take action to break down the illegal organisation by the adoption ofthe following measures : (i) Drastic reduction of all armed Jewish temporary police andabolition of Jewish police attached to British infantry,(ii) Proscription of all military training-farmed or disarmed&apos; byJews of any age or sex, other than those serving in the regular forces, throughout the country,(iii) A thorough search for Jewish arms.5. The General Officer Commanding thinks it probable that action asproposed under (6) might result in cessation of co-operation with the government by organised Jewish institutions, with consequent civil unrest and riots amongstJews and possibly some terrorist action against Arabs and British by Jewishextremists. He states that, although he is in a position to deal with developments of this kind, the training of British units in Palestine could not be continued,and he would have to oppose any further reduction in the garrison.6. Following on this statement of the General Officer Commanding^ viewsthe High Commissioner has suggested to me that there are three alternative courses: (a) To force hidden arms to light and to stamp out the whole Jewish militarymovement as early as possible. This course is regarded by the HighCommissioner as logically correct and as likely to lie popular with theArabs. On the other hand, he is certain that it will meet with intenseresistance by the Jews, leading to breakdown of co-operation, coupled with unrest, rioting and renewed extremist activity, with consequencesin the wider field of world Jewry which may have an adverse effect onthe war situation.(b) To ignore the organisation.   In the High Commissioner&apos;s opinion theonly argument for this course is that of convenience. Against it heargues that there has been too much publicity to make such a coursepracticable; that it is ignominious and that it will encourage the jews and inflame the Arabs, again, with consequences which may have an adverse effect on the war situation.(c) To adopt a middle course which would avoid inflaming Jews or arabs and need not interfere with the training of the troops nor precludepossible reductions in the garrison.ST O7. The High Commissioner summarises his proposals for action under the compromise plan (c) as follows : (i) If reliable information is received regarding the locale of hidden arms,a search should be carried out, but particular care should be taken toavoid any unnecessary untoward incident,(ii) Any drilling should be stopped as being illegal under the Criminal LawOrdinance.(iii) The process of disbanding temporary Jewish police which is now being-carried out for reasons of economy should be extended, partly for that reason and partly on account of the disclosures at the recent trial.(iv) On the other hand, there should be no systematic or wholesale searchof towns and villages.The High Commissioner realises that the action described under (i), (ii) and (iii)may lead to some clashes, but he considers that the risk must be faced. TheGeneral Officer Commanding holds the view that anything less than the actiondescribed in paragraph 4 (b) above will not have the effect of stamping out theorganisation, which will remain as an underground army, although its expansionwill be checked. The High Commissioner does not dissent from this view. Headds that the General Officer Commanding is fully alive to the issues involved and is quite prepared to regulate his action in consultation and accord with theHigh Commissioner.8. After careful study of the reports on the incidents referred to in para-graph 1, and of the evidence which has accumulated in past years, I can onlyconcur with the conclusion of the High Commissioner and the General OfficerCommanding that a considerable and widespread Jewish military organisation
exists in Palestine, and that the ultimate object of securing Jewish supremacy inthe country by military action is not absent from the minds of its organisers.At the recent trial it was argued by the defence, by way of mitigation, that the prisoners (all of whom had served at some time in the police force) were desirousto perfect their previous military training with a view to the defence ofPalestine, service in the British Army and the overthrow of Nazism. This pleais refuted by an accumulation of evidence pointing to the existence of this organisation many years before the outbreak of the present war. The numberof members of the organisation is unknown, but the General Officer Commandingregards as a fair estimate of the number of illegal arms held 1,500-2,000 rifles,8,000-10,000 pistols of all types,and a considerable but incalculable number of hand grenades.9. In a recent letter the Jewish Agency have contended that the possessionof illegal arms by Jews for the purpose of self-defence, particularly in theagricultural settlements, has for long been known to the authorities, and thatthe Government of Palestine has connived at the use of such weapons. Theevidence of connivance produced by the Jewish Agency is very weak and, whatever may have been the case at some periods in the past, the implication that the inadequacy of the defence forces provided by the Government has compelled theJews to arm themselves for the defence of their colonies against Arab attackscannot now be sustained. Provision for the defence of the Jewish coloniesagainst Arab aggression has always been a foremost consideration of the Govern-ment of Palestine. It is true that in the disturbances of 1929, as a result ofan over-optimistic policy of disarmament, arrangements for the defence of certainisolated Jewish colonies were found to be inadequate, but since that date defectsof organisation have been remedied, and the numbers of armed Jewish police and watchmen have been progressively increased, to figures agreed with theJewish Agency, with the result that during the last two years concerted Arabattacks on Jewish colonies have had little or no success. In addition the disarmingof the Arabs has proceeded apace during the last eighteen months or so. Asa result of intensive searches of villages, 2,226 rifles, 855 pistols and 113,975rounds of ammunition have been captured since January 1938. as well as largequantities of other weapons, bombs and explosives. Moreover, the government now have in Palestine a large military force and an expanded armed police force which finally dispose of any argument that a separate Jewish military force is required for defence purposes. No military or police force, whatever its strength or organisation, can prevent the occurrence of isolated murders or acts of sabotage; nor could such incidents be prevented if the Jews were authorisedto arm themselves and to organise their own defensive force. The elimination of those incidents will only come gradually with the development of goodwillbetween the Jews and Arabs.10. It appears to me to be obvious that, in principle, the firmest possible measures should be taken to discourage or suppress this illegal Jewishorganisation. The existence of an independent armed force of this nature,whatever its object, ought not to be tolerated in any country under british administration. Moreover, it would be quite unjustifiable, in&apos; my opinion, toadopt in the case of the Jewish organisation a more lenient attitude than wehave shown in dealing with armed conspiracy by the Arab population; anysuspicion of such discrimination would arouse strong Arab feeling in Palestinewith grave consequences to our relations with the Middle Eastern countries andwith Moslem countries further afield.11. In present circumstances, however, I recognise the importance of avoiding any action in Palestine which may hamper our war effort. Drastic andwholesale action with the object of destroying the Jewish military organisaion may arouse such resentment in Zionist circles both within and without Palestinethat-(a) we should lose some Jewish support in the war and possibly even incursome Jewish hostility, and(b) Jewish riots and terrorism would break out in Palestine and make &apos;timpossible to release any part of the British garrison for serviceelsewhere.
12. Both of these considerations suggest the advisability of caution,although in any protest against British repressive action in this matter the jews would be on the weakest possible ground, and it is difficult to believe that theycould receive support from any disinterested and responsible section of british or world opinion. The latter consideration mentioned above is, however, of thefirst importance. For the effective prosecution of the war the number of trainedBritish troops immobilised in Palestine on internal security duties should bereduced to the minimum at the earliest possible date and. if only for this reason,I am in favour of the middle course proposed hy the High Commissioner, subjectto certain amendments of detail.13. I therefore recommend that the High Commissioner should be authorisedto proceed on the following lines : (a) Searches for arms.If reliable information regarding hidden arms is received a searchshould be carried out with particular care to avoid any unnecessary untowardincident. If arms are found, the persons in possession of then! should be tried by a military court and should be liable to the penalties provided underthe Defence Regulations. There should be no systematic or wholesale searchof towns and villages, but the Palestine Government should not be content to wait for information with regard to hidden arms and should intensifycontrol over the smuggling of arms at the land and maritime frontiers and preserve an active &quot;intelligence&quot; policy in Palestine.(b) Drilling.This offence is not covered specifically by the Defence Regulations, andfor this reason the High Commissioner proposes that proceedings should betaken under certain sections of the Criminal Law Ordinance which provides a maximum penalty of seven years&apos; imprisonment for this offence. It isprobable, however, that Jews who are found drilling will be found to becarrying, or in possession of, arms, in which case they would be liable toprosecution in a military court under the Defence Regulations. In the circumstances-stances. I propose to ask the High Commissioner to issue a Defence Regula-tion dealing with the offence of drilling and providing appropriate penalties,thus enabling all cases of this nature to be tried by the military courts.(c) Jewish temporary police.The process of disbanding temporary Jewish police should be extendedto the limits compatible with the effective protection of the Jewishsettlements.15. I have already referred to the opinion of the General Officer Com-manding that the limited scheme of action proposed above will not have the effectof stamping out the organisation, although it will check its expansion. later on it may become necessary to take more drastic action, but in the meantime itshould be sufficient to keep the movement in check by the measures proposed above, which provide no foothold for Jewish propaganda and which should notimpede plans for the early relief of part of the British regular garrison. Thereis reason to hope that law and order in Palestine will before long have been sufficiently restored to allow of the resumption of civil control throughout thecountry. This will, of covu-se, entail the abolition of military courts and respon-sibility for the measures proposed above for dealing with illegal arming andtraining of Jews will then devolve upon the Police Force and the Civil Courts.16. I shall be glad to have the approval of the War Cabinet for the^lineof action proposed in paragraph 13 above, with which the Secretary of Statefor War is in agreement.M.
