THE CASE OF THE SOVIET SHI? &quot;SSLENGA&quot;1.  The Soviet vessel &quot;SELEHGA&quot;, bound from Manila toVladivostok, was intercepted hy one of Jl.il.  ships aboutJanuary 11th and. taken to Hong Kong for contrabandexamination.      The cargo includes 1190 in.   tons of wolframore, 596 m.   tons of antimony ore, 98 m.  tons of tin,  andh96 tons of Brazilian coffee.      The wolfram and antimonyhave been despatched in accordance with the existingSino-Soviet barter agreement, by which these commodities are exchanged for arms and industrial machinery.2.  Representations have already been received fromthe Soviet and the Chinese representatives.      The soviet ambassador addressed on January 17th an official note tothe Foreign Office, protesting against what he described as &quot;the illegal detention of the Soviet s.s.  &quot;SELEiTGA&quot;on the open seas!i and asking that immediate measures should be taken for the release of the ship as well as of her cargo.      H. ii. Ambassador in Shanghai reportsthat he has received strong representations from theSoviet Ambassador in China regarding the arrest of thisvessel and a categoric assurance that the goods inquestion are for consumption in Russia (Chung-Kingtelegram No. 6 Tour of January 16).      The French embassy at Chung-King apparently disbelieve this assurance(Chung-King telegram No.  20) but there seems littlejustification for their attitude, which may be influenced by their difficulties in obtaining from china the wolfram that they want.      Moreover, the ChineseEmbassy in London have made representations and have requested;,  on behalf of the Chinese Government,  thatthe shipment be released with as little delay aspossible.      H. 1.1. Ambassador in China has also telegraphedto/

to state that the Chinese Government attach the greatest importance to this cargo, which, they state, remainsChinese property until it reaches Vladivostok;    theChinese fear that if it is held, up they will he deprived of the Soviet arms and munitions which they urgentlyrequire and to which they claim to he entitled under theSino-Soviet barter agreement,  the precise details ofwhich are not accurately known to us.3-    My colleagues will remember that they have alreadyconsidered what action should be taken v,-hen a Sovietship is detained in the Contraband Control.      At their meeting on November 22nd, the War Cabinet considered inthe light of a paper submitted by the Minister ofEconomic Warfare (W.P,   (G)  (39)9h) the treatment to be accorded to Soviet ships in the Contraband Control and agreed as follows:-(i) General approval was given to theproposals of the Minister of economic warfare, under which Soviet vesselsworld receive the same treatment atthe hands of the Contraband control authorities as other neutral shipping.In certain circumstances,  therefore,their cargoes would, he liable toseizures with a view to their being sent to the Prize Court,(ii) Subject to (i) above,  the Minister ofEconomic warfare was invited to instruct the Contraband control authorities to avoid,  as far aspossible, action likely to lead to aserious dispute with the SovietGovernment.    One method of avoidingsuch a result might be to spin outthe processes of requesting guarantees,making enquiries,  etc.(iii) The Minister was invited to keep intouch with the Foreign Secretary inregard, to any case which appeared likely to give rise to serious difficulty,h.    There are certain difficulties in the way of applying this decision in the present case.      In the firstplace/

place,  there is the complication that Sir A.  Clark Kerrhas already received what he describes as a categoricassurance that the-cargo is for consumption in Russia.The exact terms of the assurance are not known and ifit is desired to &quot;spin out the processes of requestingguarantees, making enquiries, etc.&quot; it would presumablystill be possible to ask the Soviet Ambassador inLondon,  in view of the vagueness of our information from China, whether his Government could guarantee that none of this material, nor its products, would be re-exported to Germany.      If the Ambassador gave this guarantee,  the cargo would be allowed to proceed.      If,on the other hand,  the guarantee were not forthcoming,the cargo would be further detained pending the resultof enquiries at i.ioscow.5-    Before deciding to ask the Soviet Ambassador fora guarantee as proposed above, I think we should dowell to consider what is likely to happen if we are faced with a refusal on the part of the Soviet Governmentto provide any such assurances.      We would in that eventcontinue to detain the &quot;SSLEHGA1 S&apos;1 cargo at Hong Kong,and would, institute further enquiries at Moscow and elsewhere to ascertain whether there was any evidencethat the goods were genuinely destined for consumption in Russia.      It is doubtful whether conclusive evidence on the subject would be forthcoming.      Meanwhile thecontinued detention of the goods at Hong Kong would nodoubt give rise to further Russian protests,  and would bethe cause of continued, and perhaps increasing resentmentin Soviet Russia.    &apos; &quot;e would not, however, be able to postpone a decision indefinitely whether or not the cargoshould h   allowed to proceed.      We might eventually decide to/

to release the goods,  and such action on our partmight give the impression of yielding to Soviet pressure,with an unfortunate effect on our prestige in the far east.      Alternatively,, we might eventually decide to announce our intention of seizing the goods,  or atleast of detaining them indefinitely- and this would no doubt give rise to a crisis in our relations with soviet Russia, which would he all the more serious afterthe resentment aroused through the continued, detention of the cargo.6.    Then there is the question whether it would, hewise to detain further this particular cargo in viewof the position of the Chinese Government.      Sir A.  ClarkICerr reports that during the past year constant ship-ments of wolfram and. antimony ores have been made to russian ports in accordance with the Gino-Soviet barteragreement,  and that any attempt on our part to interferewith the res trie led means now at the disposal of theChinese for fulfilling their side of the bargain would cause consternation and. resentment.      The ChineseMinister for Foreign Affairs had represented, earnestlythe vital importance of the supplies which China is nowreceiving from Russia under the barter agreement;    hestates that if China were prevented from carrying out^^r corn&apos;-&quot;1- f---&quot; tt  to Russia,  these supplies would, be cutoff and. her power of resistance to Japan damaged.7.    On the other hand, arguments could be ad.ducedagainst allowing this material to proceed, to Russia.Since the War Cabinet1s decision,  quoted in paragraph above,  the situation has been altered by the russian aggression against Finland and the resulting resolutions of the League of Nations.      On December Ihth.  theAssembly/

Asseinbly adopted a resolution,  in which, among other things, it&quot;Solemnly condemns the action taken bythe Union of Soviet oocialist Republicsagainst the State of Finland;&quot;Urgently appeals to every Member of theLeague to provide Finland with such material and humanitarian assistance asmay be in its po,:er and. to refrain fromany action which might weaken Finland&apos;power of resistance;&quot;Authorises the Secretary-General to lend the aid of his technical services in the organisation of the aforesaidassistance to Finland;&quot;And likewise authorises the secretary general,  in virtue of the Assemblyresolution of October uth, 1937? to consult non-member States with a viewto possible co-operation.&quot;The terras of this resolution are being interpreted in the sense that where exports from the U.h.  or the Colonies tothe U.S.S.R.  are concerned, licences are in generalrefused for commodities which might be useful to thatcountry in the prosecution of hostilities,  and thus&quot;weaken Finland.&apos; s power of resistance. &quot;     In so far asthe shipments of wolfram and antimony from China to theU.S.S.R.  under the barter arrangement referred to inparagraph 2 above were transshipped at Kong Kong andtherefore came under our export licencing control, H.i-,1.Government acquiesced, in them up to the end of last year.But in sanctioning the December consignment it was indicated, to the Chinese Embassy on December 28th, 1939;that this must not he regarded as a precedent, and thatno undertaking could be given that we should be able toallow further shipments of this kind to be sent from hong Kong to Vladivostok at present,  since the Russianattack on Finland, and the&apos; resultant Resolution of theLeague of Nations had. created, a new situation.      But, ofcourse/

course,  this decision would not apply to the presentconsignment, which has not been imported into Hong hong,but is on board a Russian vessel intercepted by our contraband Control while en route from Manila toVladivostok.8.    To sum up,  there are three courses of action open for consideration:-a)    That we should adopt the procedure contemplated in the decision of November 22,  1939? viz., to treat theproblem as purely one of contraband control:    in that case we should either release the vessel on the basis ofthe categoric assurance which H.M. Ambassador in Chinahas already received from the Soviet Ambassador, that thegoods in question are for consumption in Russia, or wecould, ask for further guarantees from the soviet ambassador in London, while continuing for the present to detain the cargo at Hong Kong.b;    To release the cargo without further delay inview of the fact that further detention may seriously prejudice the Chinese Government!s position.      In that event it would be possible  to base our decision also onthe categoric assurances which are reported to have beengiven by th   Soviet Ambassador in China.c)    To take action against Russia as an aggressor by refusing in present circumstances to allow the &quot;SELIINGA&quot;cargo to proceed,  although this could, not be justified asa matter of Contraband Control.9.    In my view the circumstances of the case do not justify the adoption of course (c).      A refusal to allow the cargo to proceed would have many obvious disadvantagesI am advised, moreover,  that our League obligations donot require us to take this course,  though the provisionsof/

of the Covenant and the League resolutions would, entitleus to do so,  at any rate vis a vis Russia.      If it were,in fact, desirei&quot; to detain the cargo indefinitely, manylegal points would rrise which would have to he gone into further.10.  I would, therefore, recommend that we should adopteither course (a)  or course (b),  that is to say, that weshould either ask the Soviet Ambassador for furtherguarantees that neither the material nor its products will,in fact, be re-exported to Germany, and. that we shouldrelease the cargo immediately such a guarantee has beenreceived;    or, alternatively, that we should release the cargo at once, oa the ground that a categoric&apos;assurancehas already been given by the Soviet Ambassador in Chinathat the goods are for use in Russia.      I am inclined tothe view that in this case it may be preferable not toask for any further guarantees from the Soviet Government,as any delay in obtaining the required assurances mighthave such a prejudicial effect on the Chinese.     We might.,however, make it clear to the Chinese Government thatour consideration for their interests in this casecannot be regarded as prejudicing the future exercise ofour belligerent rights over similar cargoes, and we mightremind the Chinese Ambassador of the letter addressed tohim on the issue of export licences from Hong Kong bythe Ministry of   economic Warfare on December 26th, 1939-January 28th, 19*4-0.R. H. C.
