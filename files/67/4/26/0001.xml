(A_s 273(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET.&apos;g.P. (G) (40)26- COPY NO. A3WAR      CABINET.ITEGQTIATIQMS WITH ITALY.Memorandum by the Preside.it of the Board of Trade.Paragraph 15 of the Memorandum on the Negotiationswith Italy appended to the Note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Economic Warfare(Paper Mo. W.P.(G)(40)21), was not agreed with my Department,and I should like to draw the attention of the War Cabinet tocertain considerations which arise in connection v/ith theproposals for additional imports of agricultural andhorti-agricultural produce from Italy.While recognising the special circumstances of thepresent case, I feel it necessary to enter the caveat thatour offer to the Italians should not include fruit orvegetables or other produce of a kind which would lead to major difficulties in our relations with other countries.It is particularly important that our offer should not involve the use of import licensing as an instrument forreplacing imports from other normal sources of supply, suchas the United States of America and Canada, by imports from italy, i.e. we should not licence imports from Italy inexcess of their normal previous imports, while reducingimports from the other normal sources of supply.      We have maintained this principle strongly even in the recent negotiations with our ally France.      Having refused toallow France to send us goods, including fresh vegetables,at the expense of the normal supply from other countries, an

impossible situation would arise if we adopted anothercourse with neutrals.We are at present prohibiting imports of applesfrom the United States of America and restricting thenby 50 per cent, from Canada.      The United States havealready expressed great concern about apples and we shouldbe heading for serious trouble with both the United Statesof America and Canada if we allowed Italian apples toreplace the supplies we normally get from North America.I believe that in the  1 million under fruit and vegetables, ^r million is in respect of apples, whereas in pre-wartimes Italy did not send apples to this country.Another case in point is Spain.     Difficulties wouldbe introduced into the present negotiations with Spain iflargely increased quantities of various types of fruit and vegetables and other produce of which Spain is normally thechief supplier were taken from Italy at Spain&apos;s expense.The foregoing difficulties would, of course, bestill further increased if it were found necessary to raiseour offer to buy additional produce from Italy to theextent of  5 million.(Initialled)      A.R..D.Board of Trade.27th Januaryy 1940.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.27th January, 1940.
