NOTE 3Y THE MINISTRY OP LABOIR .Shipbuilding Labour.Fluctuation in numbers employed in the industry since 1914/18.1.     The present numbers of male shipyard workers of all gradesengaged on production work in Great Britain and Northern Ireland(that is to say not including ancillary v/orkers, but including all shipwrights, platers, riveters, caulkers, drillers, otherskilled workers, apprentices and also labourers) is probably inthe region of 170,000.       This figure includes 150,000 men employed in the private shipyards in respect of which returns are made to the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation, and some40,000 men employed in the Royal Dockyards.     Comparable figures at April 1959 were 90,000 employed in the private shipyards,and 58,000   in the Royal Dockyards, making a total at that timeof 128,000.      It will be seen that there has been a veryconsiderable expansion in the numbers employed in the industryin the last nine months or so, notwithstanding the largenumber  of n:n known to have been called up for. service in the Armed Forces in the meantime.2.     The only figures of employment we have in respect of theGreat War are those published in the Ministry of Labour Gazette -i.e. the number of insured persons recorded as being attached tothe industry.     According to these records, the peak point in shipbuilding production was reached in October, 1918, when277,500 insured workpeople (including some 9,000 women) wererecorded as having been employed in the industry.      This figure* and *dropped to 227,000   in 1924^to 162,000 in the second half of 1959.It seems reasonable to suppose that the peak figure of 277,500s      These figures may be slightly overstated: this question isnow under investigation.f       A deduction of 8% has been made, to allow for non-manual workers who wore not included in the earlier figures.

133-/-/would have included r. fair number of - noillary workers(e.g. cleaners, messengers, engine drivers, &quot;transport workersetc.)       Making an allowance of 2*5&apos;,o for this item and deductingthe 9,000 v/omen known to have he on employed at the time, it can be  estimated that the numhor of productive workers now employed(170,000) compares with a figure of 260,000 male workers employed at the peak period at the end of 1918.     Moreover we are now atthe beginning of dilution, whereas dilution had been in fullswing for several years by the end of 1918, so that the quality of the shipyard labour now employed is probably somewhat higherthan it was then.3.      During the post-1918 depression,  a number of skilled workers as well as the bulk of the war time dilutees would have left theindustry (although a number of men would have returned to it on demobilisation) and during that period the number of apprenticeswho entered the shipyards fell off drastically.       Theapprenticeship position has improved enormously since the rearmament programme started;    indeed, the number of apprenticesrose from 10,150 in March 1936 to 16,011 in April 1939.      Sincerearmament, too, a number of skilled workpeople who left theindustry during the depression must have returned to it,although simultaneously there was a movement away from itowing to the migration of eg. boiler makers and sheet metalworkers to well paid jobs in the engineering and aircraft industries.The general expansion of the shipbuilding industrysince rearmament started is to be seen from the following figures which relate to male workpeople employed in great britain and Northern Ireland on production work:

The statistics published in the Ministry of Labour Gazettesuggest that some 16,000 shipbuilding workers arc at presentunemployed, but this figure consists largely of ancillary workers,e.g. clerks, cleaners and miscellaneous unskilled hangers-on v/howould be of no use whatever in production.     In the whole country there are at the present time no more than some three to four thousand experienced shipyard workers out of jobs,and this figure includes the &quot;turnover&quot; of the register;      thebalance consists of elderly men and &quot;second-bests&quot; who have onnumerous occasions been submitted to employers without being taken on.      Thus it would be A    no overstatement to say that if anysubstantial addition has to be made to the total labour force ofthe shipbuilding industry, this will have to come from the generalranks of the unemployed and from persons now following other -preferably non-essential -   occupations.Prospects of Dilution.5.     From recent enquiries which have been made of the shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation, it would seem that theindustry is satisfied that it will be in a position to execute the present shipbuilding programme, although it is considered thatthis will tax the employers&apos; present resources to the utmost.The employers confirm what is already within the knowledge of

this Department - i.e. that there is at present a shortage ofshipwrights, platers, sheet metal workers, electricians andcoppersmiths, and they say that a shortage of machine riveters islikely to develop as the present programme reaches its peak in afew months&apos; time.       Of these workers in short supply, themost important grade is the  shipwright.6.     No formal Dilution Agreement has been reached between thetwo sides of the industry, hut we have been informed confidentiallythat arrangements have been made with the Shipwrights   Union thatwill permit the use of skilled joiners (to work under experiencedshipwrights) in the place of the latter, and this arrangement isexpected to remedy the shortage here.       No public announcementhas been made of this and it is desirable that the initiative in publication should be left to the parties, otherwise there isa risk of prejudicing other negotiations that are in progress.The shortage of electricians could be made good by transferringhouse electricians to shipyard work, though at present the wagesdifferential stands in the way of this remedy being applied asfreely as might be hoped.       The supply of coppersmiths could be(and is being) eked out by the transfer of plumbers to this work.Hand riveters (of whom some 1,500 are at present unemployed)could be trained to undertake machine riveting.      It will not bean easy matter to increase the supply of platers or sheet metalworkers except by getting hold of some of the boiler makers who arenow employed in the engineering and aircraft industries;      somerelief might, however, be obtained by the upgrading of experienced platers&apos;  labourers.     Welders can be trained in ashort time, and the Government Training Centres could be ofsome assistance here.

7.     Fortunately, relations between the Shipbuilding Employersand the Trade Unions organised within the Shipbuilding and engineering Confederation are at present very good.      The depth of goodwill that exists has actually been put to the test onlyin the case of the Shipwrights Union, of course, but it isbelieved that the other Trade Unions would accept the need fordilution measures if a convincing case were put to them.Conclusions.8.      The task of finding additional labour to enable an increasein the output of the Merchant shipyards from the present level ofabout 700,000 tons to 1,500,000 tons per annum will be a veryformidable one.     It is not as large an undertaking as wouldappear from the figures given in paragraphs 1 to 4 above, however,for those figures cover the labour employed in war shipconstruction and repair as well as in merchant shipbuilding: and ship repairing.     It is estimated by the Shipbuilding EmployersFederation that of the figure of 130,000 shipyard workers in theemployment of private yards as at December, 1939, not more than some 47,000 were employed on new construction and the repair ofpresentMerchant vessels.     The/problem of expansion, therefore, is one that involves increasing the present total productive labour force   of 170,000 to approximately 220,000 - i.e. it involves anincrease in the present labour force of about 30%.     If this expansion is to be achieved, however, the following measures willbe necessary:-(a)     Training.     The Government Training Centres could help with welders, coppersmiths, the lighter types of sheetmetal workers and possibly even with the heavy sheetmetal work     -   though the latter would necessitate the

introduction of training courses never beforeattempted in the Government Trrining Centres andwould need careful examination before a definiteopinion could be expressed.       Other types of workers would only be trained in the shipyards themselves,and the employers will have to be convinced that thispart of the problem needs tobe tackled in earnest.The return to the industry of work-people who have&quot;drifted away.As has been said above, many of these workers mustalready have re-entered the industry since rearmamentstarted.       Moreover, of the exceedingly large numberof workpeople employed at the peak in 1918, manymust have been unskilled dilutees who after twentymoreyears would not be of very much/use to the industry than new entrants.     But an attempt could be made bythe launching of a suitable publicity campaign to get back as many skilled workers as possible from amongstthose who mcry at present be following other employment.In order to succeed in this attempt, however, it willprobably he necessary to make special arrangementsenabling workpeople who have since acquiredsuperannuation rights (or the promise of more or lesspermanent jobs in other industries) to preserve these rights until after the war is over.Dilution^,     a much larger measure of dilution than hasprobablyat present been contemplated by the employers will/haveto be resorted to.       Between 1916 and 1918, however,(owing to the heavy drain to the Armed Forces duringthe preceding two years) the industry had to take in a large number of dilutees, and if it was possible

to do so then it should he possible to do the same thing now,       The. first step will be to arrange fortalks with the employers and the Trade Unions, bothof whom will have to be given ( in confidence) a veryfull picture of the programme which is underconsideration.       It is essential to see the employersfirst.Re-distribution of skilled labour at present inemployment. If disused shipyards (e.g. at Jarrow)are again to be brought into use5 it will obviously be essential to provide them with a substantialnucleus of skilled workers to enable them to buildup a labour force from scratch.       It is clearly desirable that such a re-distribution should beeffected by voluntary measures, but it may be necessaryto consider other means.
