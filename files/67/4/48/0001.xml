DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANITIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.jRET.iMG)(40) 48. COPY NO.x war      CABINET.CREWS FOR MERCHANT SHIPS.Memorandum by Minister of Shipping.At a meeting of the &quot;War Cabinet on the 5th February(W.M.(40) 33rd Conclusions) I was invited to submit a report enthe position in regard to the manning of merchant vessels inthe East Coast trade.    I was not present at the meeting of theWar Cabinet but apparently a discussion had arisen on certainvessels said to have been delayed at Hull.   At a subsequent meeting of the War Cabinet, the First Lord said that there hadbeen a lull in attacks on East Coast shipping but the AirMinistry were now providing standing fighter patrols and muchhad been done to provide ships with some form of defence.    he added that the attitude of merchant seamen gave no cause foranxie ty.As regards the particular incidents which gave rise tethis discussion, it appears that one vessel was delayed for atime, probably not more than a few hours, and then sailedshorthanded.    This is understood to have been due to some lossof morale.   As regards the three other vessels concerned, in onethe 2nd Engineer was ill and when a substitute had been found the vessel was held up through fog.    In another case the vessel was delayed in the river for several days ov/ing to ice and was eventually put into dock at Hull on a Friday.    The crew were    jGoole men, on weekly articles, who provided their own food andIobtained owners1 permission to proceed to Goole for food and cleafcclothes and to report for sailing on Monday.    Two other vesselsft were held up temporarily through difficulties in obtaining crewsover the week-end. :

Apart from these incidents, there have been a number of occasions on which merchant ships have been held up for short periods owing to difficulty in obtaining personnel and, inparticular, owing to difficulty in obtaining Certificated SecondEngineers and Deck Hands.The number of cases of delay has been relatively small, andthe great majority of ships experience no delay from this cause.The latest report from the organisation set up by the Owners andthe Officers&apos; and Men&apos;s Societies for the supply of crews to ships shows that the number of ships held up on the 10th february was 6.    These ships had been ready to sail on:-7th February ........, . 3 ships8th       11 .......... 1 ship9th       &quot; .......... 2 shipsTwo of the six ships were waiting for engineers.Engineers.As regards engineers, I established in November, inagreement with the representative associations, a system of temporary permits under which men with certain sea experienceare allowed to act in the place of Certificated Second Engineerswhen one is not immediately available, and on about 100 of our ships an engineer with this &quot;permit&quot; is now being employed.Further, the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts, which require all foreign-going ships to carry two certificatedengineers, have been amended by the Defence Regulation of the7th February, 1940 so as to relieve ships which do not go beyondSantander in north Spain from this requirement.These arrangements have improved the position in respect cengineers and are perhaps as far as we can expect the Unions togo in the way of dilution,  the probably as far as we ought to gowith proper regard for the safety of life at sea.

There is, however, real danger on the one hand thatengineers employed at sea may he drawn from sea employment hythe rapidly increasing attraction of shore jobs, in which many thousands of engineers with Certificates of Competency are already employed.    Some of them hold key positions, but many otherscould he released if the need for them in the Merchant Navybecomes critical.    I have been in touch with the Ministry ofSupply and they are now ascertaining how many Certificated MarineEngineers are employed in the Ordnance Factories and how manycould, if necessary, be released provided that they were willingto return to the Merchant Navy.    I am also raising at the Man-Power Priority Sub-Commit tee the question whether it is possibleto ensure that your men (including young engineer officers) whohave been reserved from military duties because they were employed in the Mercantile Marine at the time of registrationshall not be permitted to leave the Mercantile Marine for otherreserved occupations ashore.It will probably be necessary for me to seek the support ofthe Admiralty and the Air Ministry with a view to an appeal beingmade to those certificated engineers who can be released to returnto .the Mercantile Marine, and I am asking these Departments how many certificated Marine engineers are employed in the dockyards,aircraft factories, etc.. and how many of these could, if necessary,be spared.Deck Hands.As regards the supply of deck hands, special arrangements have been made for the training of unemployed stewards and firemen for service on deck.    Schools have been opened at London,Liverpool, Southampton, Glasgow and South Shields, the cost beingborne in part by the State and part of the Industry, and about50 trained men are being turned out each week. . The total numbertrained in the two months during which these courses have been running has been 374.

At my request the Dominions Office have been in touch withthe Government of Newfoundland, and I hope that it will be possible to get considerable nuhbers of men with sea experiencefrom that Dominion.    I am also in communication with the ColonialOffice as to recruitment in the Colonies and a start has beenmade with the recruitment of crews in the West Indies.Further, the Admiralty have been asked whether, as men inthe different age groups are called up under the MilitaryTraining Act, they could train as seamen a number of men inexcess of the numbers that are required for the Royal Navy, who could be offered employment in the Merchant Navy on ordinaryterms.    The understanding would be that if they leave the mercantile Marine they will become liable   for service with the armed Forces, as is the case with men of the age-groups called up who are now serving in the Mercantile Marine.The National Maritime Board has recently approved certain increases in wages and it is obviously essential that theconditions of employment in the Merchant Navy should be suffiently attractive to retain the necessary officers and menagainst the competition of shore employment.    Fortunately thereis still a good spirit which leads many of our young men tofollow the sea.Apart from the steps necessary to increase the supply of technical and other staff for manning our merchant ships, both inorder to reduce wastage and in order to find crews for the vessels which v/e are purchasing or obtaining on bare charter, I think thatthe question of morale must be constantly borne in mind.    While myreports indicate that hitherto there has been no definite holdingback from going to sea in the East Coast ports on any seriousscale, there have been signs in other ports, e.g. London, of adisinclination on the part of men to go to a North-East Coast portto join a ship.This makes it important that the maximum amount of protectionshould be given to shipping, particularly to vessels trading

constantly on the East Coast.   Many ships of the larger type arealready provided v/ith protected wheelhouse, steering position,chart and wireless rooms, as was recommended in the Notice, issuedby the Board of Trade in July last, but this is far from general on the smaller ships, where there are special problems such asthat presented by open bridges.    It is essential, if the morale of the Merchant Navy is to be maintained, that every step shouldbe taken to protect the personnel of the ships, and the Admiralty,after consultation with my department have issued an Order whichwill help to secure the proper protection of exposed personnel,I have also   made arrangements under which the Admiralty will beable to fit guns and other anti-submarine and anti-mineprotection on merchant ships to the extent which will absorb thefull capacity of the yards for this type of work.When all the measures to which I have referred above havebeen taken, there still remains the most important of all, andthat is to fend off the attacks by enemy aeroplanes which, whendelivered constantly and at short range, must have a verydisturbing effect upon the crews of the vessels attacked.    It isalso important to remember that neutral tonnage which cannot bedefensively armed (although it may be demagnetised) is becoming more and more reluctant to navigate on the East Coast or to sailto ports north of London,    The Norwegian shipowners refuse to sendtheir tanker tonnage to the East Coast and in the recent Agreementwith Greek shipowners they declined pointblank to be under any obligation to send their vessels north of London.    There can, Ithink, be no doubt that the machine-gun attacks and bombing fromthe air largely account for these refusals and that the more effectively raids from the air upon merchant shipping can be keptor driven off the less likelihood there is of any serious decay inthe morale of seamen, at any rate so far as British seamen areconcerned.J.G.Ministry of Shipping.16th February, 1940.
