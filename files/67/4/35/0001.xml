SURVEY OF THE  NATIONAL  RESOURCES  IN  RELATIONTO OUR WAR EFFORT.MEMORANDUM BY LORD STAMP.I. Introductory.AT their meeting, held on the 15th December, 1939 (E.P. (M.) (39) 12thConclusions, Minute 2), the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy invited me to prepare for their consideration as soon as possible a report containing : (a) preliminary documented account of the adequacy of our resources tomeet our war effort as at present planned under each of the following headings: (i) Foreign Exchange;(ii) Shipping (in the light of the paper on tonnage being preparedby the Ministry of Shipping for submission to the WarCabinet);(iii) Man-power (in the light of the Memorandum by the Inter-departmental Conference on the labour requirements of theproposed war programme. Paper No. E.P. (M.) (39) 51*);(b) a review of the prospective position in regard to requirements and supplies of particular raw materials of substantial importanceincluding iron and steel, timber and wool.2. I have been assisted in this task by my colleagues of the Survey ofEconomic and Financial Plans. We have decided to entrust the assembly ofthe necessary data and preparation of the preliminary calculations toMr. J. Jewkes and Mr. E. A. G. Robinson, newly appointed as Chief EconomicAssistants in the Central Economic Information Service, set up as the result ofa previous decision of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (E.P. (M.)(39) 8th Conclusions, Minute 1). Mr. Robinson was asked to take up the questionof the balance of payments in the first year of the war, while Mr. Jewkesundertook to prepare a memorandum on our man-power resources in relationto our war effort. These two documents are attached to the present report asAnnexes 1 and 2 respectively.3. We have not. in the time available, been able to cany out the full programme of investigation remitted to us. We have concentrated our mainattention on the two factors of foreign exchange and man-power, dealing onlvincidentally with the factors of raw materials and shipping.II. The Balance of Payments during&quot; the First Year of the War.4. On the 13th December, 1939. I presented a memorandum (PaperNo. E.P. (M.) (39) 52), giving the Committee a rough impression of the adverseexportomport balance and the strain on sterling resources for the first year of the war. The present report gives a closer approximation as a result of detailed investigation. The work of this investigation is continuous, with the object of getting continually closer to details, of moving the results with the changing facts,and, if possible, of subdividing the year into shorter periods. The summariseddetails are given in Mr. Robinsoirs report annexed; we have been in constantcontact with his work during its progress, and are fully aware both of the extent,and of the necessary limitations, of its factual bases; his conclusions are thosewhich Ave also draw from the available data.* Subsequently circulated to the War Cabinet as Annex A to Paper W.P. (G.) (40) !).[20708] B 2
5. The report indicates that the gross adverse balance on income account is  369 million 4-  172 or -  152 million. These margins of error are aggregateswhich would result if every item were in error in the same direction to thefull extent indicated; but the probability of this is so remote that it may onconventional lines be more fairly written as plus 6120 million and minus 100 million for the extreme limits. The reasons for the plus and minus notbeing identical is that many of the items are built up in such a way that theyare more likely to be in error from omissions than through overlaps. Whiletherefore the figure arrived at is  369 million, it would not be prudent to ignore the possibility of its exceeding  400 million.6. The estimates that have been given with regard to the balance of pay-ments relate, it should be observed, only to the first year of war. Sufficient dataare not available to make it possible to estimate the prospect for future years. Itis important to emphasise, however, that, on the basis of the programmes contem-plated, the adverse balance of payments is likely to increase rapidly andcontinuously so long as the war lasts. Under certain headings, it is true,e.g., machine-tools, &quot;connected with the development of increased productivecapacity for munition manufacture in Great Britain, it is possible that there maybe some reduction in the imports required for the war programmes. But such reductions seem likely to be heavily outweighed by increases under other headings,and also by developments which may diminish our exporting capacity.7. A disquieting light on the future outlook is thrown by the increasingdifficulties which are being experienced in connexion with the supplies of controlled materials, and especially steel. In the early months of the war a fairlyoptimistic view was entertained of the capacity of our steel industry, aided only by imports of iron ore, scrap and ingots, to meet all our requirements, and allow a margin of production for export trade purposes. But the estimates of therequirements of the different departments have grown steadily, and the latest estimates of the requirements for 1940 are so greatly in excess of the capacity ofthe British steel industry that it is now proposed to import a large quantity ofsteel in the forms of plates and ingots from the United States. Moreover, theprogramme now planned will entail a very large increase in the demand for steelduring subsequent years, under such headings as shell steel, gun steel, mercantileship-building, and French requirements. Unless, therefore, further drasticeconomies can be made in the use of steel in other directions, a large-scaleimportation of steel from the United States would be a necessary condition of the fulfilment of the various Avar programmes. This would entail a substantial directaddition to the adverse balance of payments and a further heavy drain on our shipping capacity which in certain eventualities it might be impossible to meet,and which would probably compel us to economise shipping in ways that wouldinvolve a further expenditure of foreign exchange resources. Steel is pre-eminently the basic raw material of warfare. The steady growth in the estimates of steel requirements may be taken therefore as an index of the increasing-demands on our limited resources that the existing programmes must be expectedto entail.8. We turn now to the reserves on which we can draw to meet the deficit on the balance of payments. It is not possible to give precise figures, partly because we have no precise knowledge of the size of certain&quot; assets (and corresponding liabilities), e.g., security holding, but even more because the extentto which these assets can safely be drawn on, e.g., our gold reserve, is a matternot of calculation, but of policy which will vary with varying circumstances.Some of the figures have little bearing upon the problem without a full descrip-tion of the alternative policies attaching to them, a point which can perhaps be best developed orally by me in Committee.9. We can distinguish four categories of assets and correspondingliabilities :  (a) balances held by United Kingdom residents in foreign countries, against,which we have to set balances in sterling held by overseas residents.The foreign balances of residents have been requisitioned and arebeing used by the Exchange Control; they are, however, much smaller than the corresponding liability of London to the rest of the world,
and their availability is reduced by the necessity of leaving to theirholders a substantial amount which is needed for current business(a.g., dollar balances of British insurance offices operating in U.S.A.);(b) gold; in addition to the newly mined gold which we draw from theEmpire and re-export in whole or in part to meet current claims, we entered the war with a reserve of gold accumulated in the past. the separate reserves of the Exchange Account and Bank of England havebeen amalgamated so that the gold resources of the country are nowwholly and exclusively reserved for meeting foreign payments. Itwould, however, be unsafe to draw on them too rapidly for two reasons : (i) the known existence of a large gold reserve is reassuring to foreigners with balances in London. We should refraintherefore from letting all our &quot;old 2,0 until we decide that circumstances justify us in doing what hitherto we haverefrained from doing blocking foreign balances in London :(ii) a too rapid efflux of gold might provoke the recipients to refuseto accept payment in gold (as Sweden did in the last war)preferring to let the exchange value of their currenciesappreciate or to restrict their exports to this country.(c) securities, denominated in foreign currencies and readily marketable.While the total of British capital invested overseas is large, only acomparatively small proportion of it is available as an immediatereserve against an adverse balance of payments. Our difficulties arewith a limited number of neutrals, particularly United States andthe Netherlands, to which Canada must be added as a country onwhich we must draw heavily for imports but cannot pay in sterling.These countries require payment in their own currencies or gold; themost important of them will permit us no credits. The investmentswe can realise quickly are confined to listed securities, denominatedin currencies of these countries, and enjoying a free market.The corresponding liability to this asset is the holding of readilymarketable sterling- securities in foreign hands. The only element inthis of which we have any information is the holding of BritishGovernment securities deposited by foreigners with London banks;but the total may be large in the case of certain classes, e.g.. oil, gold and leading industrial shares :(d) other investments, denominated in sterling or in currencies over whichwe have no difficulties, which might be realised, given time and thenecessity. The theoretical total of this is large, but the difficulty ofrealising, eg., British-owned railways in the Argentine or overseassubsidiaries of United Kingdom industrial concerns, is obvious. Thecorresponding and unknown liability is the overseas interest in Britishindustry, whether by shareholdings or ownership by subsidiariessituated in the United Kingdom.10. The estimate, which caution would dictate, of net assets available tomeet the current deficit would be small but for one consideration to which sofar no attention has been paid. A large part of the overseas liabilities of thiscountry, and the larger part of the overseas assets, are in the Empire which(excluding Canada), is accustomed to hold in London any surplus of moneyover local requirements. So far, therefore, as the current deficit is due to anexcess of imports from this part of the world, it is reasonable to expect thatit will involve no drain on our reserves. Payment in sterling will be acceptable,the proceeds being left in London as an addition to the London balances of the recipients and invested in British Treasury Bills and short-dated securities. if and when the limit is reached to which these Empire countries are willing tobuild up their sterling balances, it will no doubt be possible either to floatloans in these countries or to mobilise United Kingdom holdings of their Govern-ment, State, railway, and other sterling obligations.

The theoretical total of this is large, but the difficulty ofrealising, eg., British-owned railways in the Argentine or overseassubsidiaries of United Kingdom industrial concerns, is obvious.

11. We are considering here the position as regards the balance of pay-ments between Great Britain and the outside world as a whole. It is important to distinguish clearly between this calculation and the estimates that are madeby the Exchange Requirements Committee of the Treasury of the adverse balanceof payments between the whole sterling area on the one hand and the &quot; hard currency &apos;&apos; countries on the other. For the purpose of the latter estimates, thosecountries whom we are likely to find it especially difficult to pay, are singledout as countries with &quot; hard currencies,&apos;&quot; and attention is concentrated on thenet balance which we are likely to have to pay to these particular countries,credit being taken in this connexion for the proceeds of any net sales to them ofthe products of the British Colonial Empire, or of the Dominions, except Canada.For exchange control purposes, these &quot; hard currency &quot; calculations are of great value. It is in regard to this group of countries that our foreign exchange difficulties are likely to be most acute: and it is obviously desirable therefore toascertain as precisely as possible the magnitude of the probable adverse balancewith regard to each&apos; of them. But for the purpose of throwing light on the relation between our available resources and the magnitude of the war effortwe can hope to sustain, the &quot; hard currency &quot; approach is not necessarilycomplete, as it may leave out of account highly relevant factors. But it is unnecessary in the present connexion to develop these points.12. it has already been pointed out that any estimate of the extent to whichreserves could safely be drawn on must be based on considerations of policy ratherthan mere calculation. I will conclude by drawing attention to such a considera-tion the consideration of time, or the rate at which it will be safe, or evenpossible, to utilise our reserves. If time were no object and we were never pressed to force our assets on a reluctant or suspicious market, our potential reserves would bo enormous. Not only would it be possible, by special deals or by spreading the operation over years to realise a larger part of our foreign investments,irrespective of their geographical location and legal form: we could even go further and encourage foreigners to acquire United Kingdom industrial concerns, as Americans showed a tendency to do in the &apos;twenties. Doubtless thelong-term prospects for British economic life would be seriously damaged by thesale of overseas concerns which provide a preferential market for our exports,and by the change from an annual income of  150- 200 million from abroad to an annual payment of interest and dividends to foreigners. But the sacrifice,if necessary, must be made.13. This alternative is, however, not open to us. Our overseas assets are of use in war only if they can be realised in war. Even within the categories of gold and readily marketable securities, there is a danger of attempting to realise toorapidly a danger in the case of gold of raising obstacles to the receipt of our gold, in the case of securities of spoiling our own market. New York, the mostimportant market for this purpose, is extremely, probably irrationally, sensitive.There is a limit to the rate at which it will absorb even high-grade securitieswithout marking them down. An error on our part in forcing &quot;the pace mighthave the result, therefore, that we realise more securities, but receive for thema smaller total amount in dollars.14. On the other hand, if we can maintain confidence in sterling, there willbe no drain of foreign balances to contend with. We shall neither have to use our reserves to meet it nor have to block these balances and therebv inflict anadditional blow on confidence in our currency and finances. The longer we canspread out the operation the better the prices at which we may hope to realiseour securities, and the less the political clangers of forcing our gold on othercountries. Time is of the essence of the transaction, and I have had this verymuch in mind in putting what may to some seem a low figure on the amount wecan hope to realise outside the Empire by the utilisation of what superficiallyappear to be large potential reserves.15. I do not consider that it would be safe to draw on our resources of gold,foreign balances, and foreign investments to an extent of more than  150 million per annum. This, of course, is apart from the possibility of borrowing from the sterling part of the Empire which may give some material alleviation to theproblem, against which must he set the loans which will have to be made to theEmpire and to allied neutral countries.
III. Man-power in relation to our War Effort.16. In studying- the relation of our war effort to the balance of payments,it was not possible to carry our estimates beyond the first year of war. when we come to the question of man-power, it is not necessary to limit the estimatein this way, since the programmes are in this matter sufficiently precise and our resources in man-power calculable.17. The details of the man-power implications of the present programmeshave been investigated and set out for us by Mr. Jewkes, and we have examinedcarefully the basis of his work and the conclusions he draws in his annexedreport, which, in the opinion of myself and my colleagues, gives a balanced andaccurate view of this question. The practical conclusions to which it points maybe summarised as follows :- (1) The industrial effort involved in maintaining a given force is enormouslygreater than in the last war. To carry through the programme laiddown for the first twelve months of the present war involves anincrease in the labour force of the industries concerned substantially greater than that achieved in four years during the last war. Further,the more extended programme covering the first two years of thepresent war requires that the labour force of these industries shouldbe more than doubled, as contrasted with the increase of only 54 percent, achieved in twice that period during the last war. It is truethat the population of working age is much larger than in 1914. andthe growth has been particularly marked in the Metal and Engineering-group ; but the programmes, in addition to taking up all this additional capacity, call also for the further expansion indicated :(2) This expansion of the warlike industries involves an occupational and geographical re-distribution of the population in a limited time forwhich there is no precedent, either in the last war or in totalitarianGermany :(3) This re-distribution is not taking place, so far as we are able to judge,at a rate that offers any prospect of realising the programme withinthe time-limits prescribed. There are involved, if it is to take place,a reversal of the recent trend of labour from the North to the South,the provision of housing in new centres, the training or re-training ofover two million workers, the provision of inducements to mobility oflabour which has probably been reduced since 1914 by a generousnational system of unemployment insurance and relief, a further extension of contracts and much reorganisation of methods ofproduction.18. I am driven to the conclusion on the information at present availablethat the programme of war effort is not capable of achievement within the limits of time specified, though we have no reason to suppose that it is not within our national capacity, given time enough and an adequate dynamic for thetransfer of labour.19. I should like at this point to call attention to thi-ee subsidiary points which arise out of our investigations : (a) We  have  already  drawn   the  attention  of   the   interdepartmental committee on Economic Policy* to certain aspects of the sub-contracting and special labour training problems referred to inparagraph 5 of Mr. Jewkes&apos;s memorandum, and we believe that asolution of these problems would do much to assist the developmentof our war effort.(b) Some further research into the economic implications of the very widedifferences, at present only vaguely understood, between the propor-tions of her total man-power which France claims to be in her fightingservices and our own may yield results of some value.(c) Examination of the man-power problem has attracted our attention tocertain desiderata in our employment statistics, with some of whichwe propose to deal in a separate report.* in memorunda, circulated to the Interdepartmental Committee as Papers Nos. E.P. (39) 24and E.P. (40) 1, and considered at the Meeting of that Committee held on the 3rd January(E.P. (40) 1st Conclusions, Minute 1).
s20. Mr. Jewkes draws attention to the important bottlenecks and limita-tions which may prevent full programmes being achieved in the period assigned.In so far as this slows up expenditure it may, indeed, give relief pro tanto, tothe export and foreign exchange problem with which we have dealt in the first,part of this memorandum. But it is possible, on the other hand, that theexchange burden of the programmes may be incurred practically in full, althoughthe production contemplated in the programmes is not accomplished. For. as mr. Jewkes shows, the strength of the production chain is the strength of itsweakest link at any moment. If one item in supply is complete 100 per cent,and another is complete only 20 per cent., the effective production output is only20 per cent, at that moment, and all the special exchange effort to secure the other80 per cent, is lost for the time being it has put a strain on the balance of thetrade position without any effective benefit to our military effort within theperiod, and in so far as it is &quot; before its time &quot; it is wasted. In the same waysome of the labour that has been put into the 80 per cent, (of future utility)might have been devoted to exports and relieved the other side of the export-import account pro tanto. This would, no doubt, have involved raw materialsimports, but the temporary lack of balance in production may easily &quot; counttwo on a division &quot; in the exchange problem. Moreover, lack of synchronisationto the optimum point in the sub-division of industry may mean a great deal in preventing the best output of final production within the period. For ifprogrammes are not staggered, eg., if too large a part of shipbuilding programme is in the same stage, this will bring to bear excessive pressure on particularclasses of workers, while other classes who deal with later processes are waiting,with ample work in prospect, but little to do at the outset.IY.-CONCLUSIONS.21. In view of the foregoing conclusions, there are two courses of actionopen: (i) to allow the present objectives to stand with the knowledge that theycannot be attained, but with the intention that the utmost progresspossible shall be made along each line, as contributory to the totalplan;(ii) to scale down the programmes to lower figures or to spread them overa more extended period. This would make it possible to secure aharmonious balance between different parts of the programmes, suchas would have been established, if they had been the programmesoriginally drawn.22. The disadvantage of the first course indicated above is that lines of progress in production, &amp;c, to the extent to which they outdistance others, maybe ineffective for the present, and to that extent divert effort or materialprematurely which might be more economically used elsewhere. For instance, a quantity of wool may be reserved or put into manufacture for army needs which now lie considerably ahead in point of time, even though this material mightbe more advantageously used for existing export demands.23. In order to prevent the industrial approach towards a distant timeobjective from proceeding along too ragged a front in the immediate future, westrongly recommend a revision of general plans to dimensions consonant withparticular limiting factors of equipment, material, shipping and the trans-ferability of man-power. This is, of course, only a respacing of ultimate objectivesover time, and not a reduction of the national war objective potential as a whole.It may greatly assist the various priority problems, and it certainly cannot helpbut relieve the immediate import-export adverse balance and pressure uponexchange.(Signed) STAMP.Richmond Terrace, S.

ANNEX 1.Forecast of the British Balance of Payments during the First Year of the War.Memorandum by Mr. E. A. G. Robinson, Chief Economic Assistant.Central Economic Information Service.1. DURING the three years 1936-38 the retained imports of merchandiseand silver into the United Kingdom averaged about  884 million annually. Thecorresponding exports averaged about  496 million. There remained an averageadverse balance of about  388 million. This gap was mainly bridged by our&quot;invisible&quot; exports. The earnings of British shipping amounted to about 103 million: interest on oversea investments yielded some  203 million;commissions, insurance, royalties, tourist expenditure, remittances of one kind or another, provided on balance a credit which averaged about  43 million. there remained, according to the estimates of the Board of Trade, in each of these years a small debit, averaging about  43 million. This represented the balancingof a variety of capital movements, implying a small excess of the inward flow offoreign capital, of funds returning from temporary investment abroad, ofrepayments of earlier British loans and of reductions of our holdings of gold or foreign currencies, over the outward flow of new British loans, of foreign fundsreturning abroad, of increases of our foreign balances or of gold transferred toBritish ownership.2. The import plans for the first year of the war show considerable increases in certain categories, partially offset by decreases in other categories. Theretained imports of articles in Class I (food, drink and tobacco) averaged for thethree years 1936-38 about  402 million. This figure includes, however, payments made to British nationals for insurance and freights, which may be estimatedvery roughly at  30 million, leaving a net figure of about  372 million. Theimport plans of the Ministry of Food, valued as accurately as is at presentpossible, amount to about  355 million, exclusive of shipping freights and insurance. The volume of imports, measured in tonnage, is about 11 per cent,below that of the three pre-war years. If imports of tobacco both for home consumption and for manufacture for export are limited to about  12 million of the pre-war  18 million, the total for this group may amount to  367 million.3. Any similar comparison of import plans of raw materials or manufac-tured imports with those of the pre-war years is difficult, since not all materials are included in the estimates of imports provided by the Ministry of Supply,and since plans are necessarily somewhat fluid between imports in an Unmanufactured-factured and a partially manufactured state. The imports of materials and semi-finished products covered by the estimates of the Raw Materials Depart-ment of the Ministry of Suppiy may be estimated at about  280 million,exclusive of shipping freights and insurance and after allowance has been madefor certain re-exports. The imports of goods covered by import licences, so faras they are not included in the estimates given above for food and raw materials,are likely to amount to some  43 million. There remain a variety of goods, not covered by the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Supply, or by the import licensing&quot; Department, of which the value imported in 1937 was approximately 38 million. A large part of these imports came from Germany and. though someof them are urgently needed, many of them are of a character that is unlikely tobe required in time of war. A provision of  20 million is probably sufficient tocover them.4. The imports of Petroleum, both for civilian purposes and for the use ofthe Army and the Royal Air Force, but excluding those for the Navy, which areincluded in the Admiralty requirements below, may be estimated, very approxi-mately, at  70 million. The whole question of oil purchases is at present underreview, and this figure may need modification in the light of later information.5.   To these ordinary imports have to be added the requirements of thefighting services.   These arise partly from purchases of munitions and war materials abroad, partly from disbursements for foodstuffs, materials or labour on foreign stations, partly from the expenditure of troops serving outside the[20708] c
eUnited Kingdom. The estimates for some of these are necessarily subject to avery wide margin of error. The requirements of the Admiralty may be put at 23 million, those of the War Office at  86 million, those of the Ministry ofSupply for munitions purchases at  37 million, and those of the Royal Air force at about  38 million, when certain duplication with the imports of machine todsestimated under the Import Licensing Department has been eliminated. Thetotal of these may be put at approximately  184 million.6. The total of these imports. amounts to about  964 million. It must,however, be emphasised that this figure is subject to a very large margin of possible error. These prospective plans have been broadly considered in the lightof shipping resources available, but might have to be considerably modified if theshipping situation changed for the worse. The prices estimated are only incertain cases already fixed, and those for the remainder can be no more thanreasoned guesses: the quantities can only be estimated with any precision wherea Ministry, or Control, or a central trade organisation is purchasing the wholor a large part of the whole. The needs of the services must remain somewhatuncertain.   It would thus be safer (see below, paragraph 11) to put the figureonOA -f  102 million,at  964 mil ion      r..--  o7 million.7. Any estimate of exports is even more uncertain. The values of exportsfor September and October were in each case no more than 52 per cent, of thecorresponding months of 1937. Those for November and December have been83 per cent, and 92 per cent., respectively, of the corresponding months. Theserelatively high values have been achieved in part, at least, by obtaining betterprices for a smaller volume of exports. The quantity of exports in December1939 was only about 88 per cent, of the quantity in December 1937. If it were possible to maintain a value of exports as high as 90 per cent, of those of 1937for the remainder of the year, the total for the year would amount to about 433 million. There are. however, reasons to fear that so high a level is unlikely to be achieved : (a) The high exports of November and December are to some extent a consequence of delays and difficulties in September and October.(b) Exports during the last four months to a large extent represent orders placed or contracts running before the outbreak of avar. While this implies that prices have not been adjusted to new levels, the temporarycontinuance of a high volume of exports is probably more significant.(c) The exhaustion of manufacturers&apos; stocks and the increasing shortages ofcertain raw materials are not yet fully reflected in the export figures.(d) The development of the munitions programmes will increasingly compete with the export trades for skilled labour.(e) Manufacturing capacity is in some eases likely  to be absorbed in producing munitions.(/) The increasing levels of employment and purchasing power in the home market are likely to divert resources from the export trades.For these reasons it is to be doubted whether, in the absence of some specificinducement to export, the total for the first year of the avar Avill exceed 400 million, and it may possibly fall considerably below that figure. In anestimate of the balance of payments it is safer to put the figure as  390 million+  50 million.-  30 million.8. The adverse balance of merchandise imports and exports is thus likelyto be of the order of  574 million. But in comparing this balance with that of pre-war years, it must be remembered that for those years our imports are valuedinclusive of freight and insurance, much of which Avas paid to British nationals,whereas these estimates of imports are exclusive of freight and insurance. Invaluing the services of British shipping as an &quot; invisible export &quot; it is therefore necessary to exclude earnings in carrying British imports, and to make deductionalso for the freights earned by neutrals in carrying British imports. When theseadjustments have been made it would appear probable that the necessaryreductions approximately offset the net earnings in other respects, and that there remains no substantial positive or negative balance.9. The earnings of British capital invested abroad have been estimated tobe  185 million in 1938.   Of this, a relatively small proportion was drawn from
the European enemy countries. Of some  3,240 million of British-owned foreign securities in 1936, it was estimated that no more than  230 million were invest-ments in European countries, enemy, neutral or allied. To the extent that foreign securities have to be sold, some reduction of income is to be expected. On theother hand, roughly  100 million of the  185 million of income was derived fromcely in pimoreover, in countries whose currency has appreciated in terms of sterling. this estimate of  185 million for 1938 does not include certain sources of income, suchas the head office and other expenses of British companies operating abroad, and profits received but not distributed. On the other hand, it makes no deduction(as does the estimate quoted in paragraph 1) for interest payments due from thiscountry to foreign investors. When these and other factors are taken intoaccount, it may be expected that earnings will be of the order of  185 million.10. The Board of Trade have estimated our net earnings from commissions,insurance, tourist traffic, royalties and various miscellaneous sources at a figurethat has varied during recent years between  35 million and  50 million. Theinterruptions to the ordinary flow of trade, the centralised purchase of variouscommodities, the virtual cessation of tourist traffic, and the diminution ofexchange transactions have reduced the credit items in this total considerably more than the debit items. It would he unsafe to expect a credit balance of morethan some  20 million.11. These credit and debit items for the first year of the war are brought together in the following table : ( 000,000&apos;s)Debit.

While individuallymany of these figures may prove somewhat wide of the mark, it is not likely that the general conclusion to which they lead will be invalidated.12. The general conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing calculationsis therefore that, so far as present information makes it possible to judge: (a) The Net Adverse Balance on income account in the first year of thewar (September 1939-August 1940) is likely to be of the order of 369 million;(b) If imports exceed or exports fall short of, the estimated figure givenin the preceding table, the Net Adverse Balance might easily exceed 400 million.(Signed) E.

ANNEX 2.Man-power in relation to our National Effort.Memorandum by Mr. J. J etches, Chief Economic Assistant, Central economic information service. The Estimates of the Inter-Departmental Conference on labour requirements.1. THE memorandum recently drawn up by the Inter-departmental conference on Labour Requirements (Paper E.P.(M.) (39) 51) concentrates uponthe vital issue of shortages in the engineering and metal trades, and seeks toindicate the orders of magnitude involved. The salient facts of the memorandum are these. In Autumn 1939 the number of workers in Engineering and metal goods*; Aircraft, Motor Vehicles, &amp;c; Shipbuilding and Repairing was1.860,000. Taking the expressed requirements of the fighting services and making allowances for the export trade and necessary civilian consumption itappears that this figure must be increased to 3,200,000 (a 72 per cent, increase) by july-September 1940. and to 4.000,000 (an 117 per cent, increase) by July-September 1941.2. If this programme is to be even approximately achieved it will demandan occupational and geographical re-distribution of labour on an unprecedentedscale. Some indication of the magnitude of the task is given by contrasting whattook place in the last war with what is contemplated in the first two years of thepresent war. The comparison can only be made between the movements in*&apos; Metals&quot; (i.e., Metal Manufacture, Engineering. Construction and Repair of vehicles, Shipbuilding and Ship Repairing, other Metal Trades and government establishments) during the last war and the smaller group of Engineering and metal Trades, Aircraft and Motors, Shipbuilding and Repairing on this occasion.But the conclusions to be drawn are probably reinforced by this difference in thescope of the figures.Numbers Employed (000&apos;s).Engineering and Metal Trades,Metals.

In the last war, owing to the absence of a schedule of reserved occupations, large numbers of men from the Metals group were allowedto join the fighting forces. In the year July 1914-15, 19 per cent, of the originallabour force had joined the forces and by July 1916 this percentage had risen to 26 and by July 1918 to 42. Whilst it is true that some 6 per cent, of thelabour in the engineering and related trades had, by December 1939, joined theforces, the operation of the schedule of reserved occupations will presumably, inthe future, prevent any large further increase. It is, therefore, of value to compare for the two periods the actual number of new workers drafted into industry.* General, Electrical and Marine Engineering, Scientific and Photographic instruments and Apparatus, General Iron Founding, Electric Cable and Apparatus, Process and Allied MetalWares and Miscellaneous Goods Manufacture.

It will demand a re-disposal of labour, both as to occupation and as to place, which far transcends any efforts of a likekind even in revolutionary or totalitarian societies.II. Subsequent study of the estimated demand for labour.4. The estimates of the Interdepartmental Conference were made somemonths ago and they were made, as a matter of urgency, when the plans ofthe fighting services were in a rapid state of transition. It is, therefore, necessaryto scrutinize the bases upon which the estimates were made and to indicate any changes which may have taken place in the interim necessitating a revision ofthe preliminary figures.5. It must be noted that the estimates of labour requirements are basedupon two assumptions, both of which lie on the side of optimism. It is assumed that all the unemployed in the industries concerned are absorbed, which implies that sub-contracting has been virtually pushed to the limit, that the scatteredpools of engineering and related labour everywhere have been frilly utilised forthe war effort. It assumes that the whole of the labour in the motor vehicleindustry can be promptly switched over either to the making of munitions or tothe vital needs of the export trade or civilian consumption. Since September1939 progress has been made in both these directions. Sub-contracting for theAir Ministry, for instance, is very well advanced. But neither of these assumptions is likely to be correct in the short period. Sub-contracting has probably some way to go yet in Army and Navy supply. In November 1939 theunemployment rate was 3-4 per cent, in Engineering; 4-8 per cent, in motor vehicles and Aircraft; 10-1 per cent, in Shipbuilding; and 5-4 per cent, inother Metal Industries. If some unemployment must be tolerated in these industries, the Interdepartmental estimates would be on the low side. Whether,in fact, the global figures are of the right order of magnitude turns upon three other questions which cannot, at the moment, be answered with precision, but uponwhich some evidence is available.(a) How far are the standards of equipment and maintenance laid down bythe fighting forces consistent with our economic strength?6. This is a subject of great complexity upon which final judgment willhave to be withheld until much more research can be carried out both in thetechnical and the economic field. Differences of opinion as to what iseconomically feasible in mechanization, maintenance and equipment will probablycrop up most sharply in the case of the Army. By September 1940 the Ministryof Supply&apos;s needs for Engineering labour is estimated at 760,000, which will be nearly 60 per cent, of the whole supply of that labour required by all three[20708] * d 2Metals.July, 1914-15July, 1914-16July, 1914-18Males.3376431,105Females.Total.
Services. Between 1940 and 1941 the additional labour of this type required bythe Ministry of Supply will be 395,000, nearly 90 per cent, of the increase called for in this group for the whole of the Fighting Services.7. It is in the case of the Army that British policy as regards mechaniza-tion. maintenance and equipment appears to depart most strikingly from thatfollowed by France and Germany. The economic implications of it deserve closerexamination than they have yet received. It must be remembered that theEngineering potential of both Germany and France is considerably lower thanin this country. Comparisons can only be made within a wide margin of error,but the relative order of magnitude of the Engineering industries in 1936 seemedto be as follows : Great Britain.   Germany.      France.Engineering ......      100 72 44Even when one takes into account the longer period during which France andGermany have been rearming heavily and the extremely rapid rate at which weare seeking to build up an army, it appears almost inconceivable that the other two major armies are adhering to our standards of mechanization and equipment or could contemplate the repair of the wastage of battle as swiftly as our own requirements would appear to involve.(b) How far, given the requirements of the Fighting Forces, have the estimates of labour required been based on reasonable assumptions?8. An examination of these estimates, which are necessarily in most casesvery approximate, suggests that they are reasonable. The InterdepartmentalReport stressed the point that the estimates of labour requirements are strictlyminimum figures.(c) Is there any evidence, up to the present, that equipment and munitionsare not coming forward at the anticipated rates in that the estimates of labour requirements for the period are excessive?9. A deficiency in the supply of war equipment may. of course, be due to ashortage of labour. On the other hand, the deficiencies may be attributable toother bottle-necks (shortage of machine tools, shortage of raw materials, &amp;c), and,in some instances, these other limitations upon production may make it impossibleto employ as much labour as was originally intended. The following checksupon the programme appear to be the most important: (i) The estimated supplies coming forward to the Ministry of Supply arenot reaching the levels upon which labour requirements were based.Many of these deficiencies are not attributable to labour shortage,(ii) The labour programme of the Admiralty and the Ministry of shipping for the first year was based upon an output of 1,000,000 gross tonsof merchant shipping. The actual output will not exceed 800,000 tons,(iii) The allowance of labour for exports assumed that the war volume of exports would be equal to the pre-war. In the first four months ofwar exports of machinery and electrical goods and apparatus, byquantity, were probably less than two-thirds of the pre-war volume.On the other hand, certain items in the war programme may be expanded withinthe near future. If, for example, the merchant shipbuilding programme were increased, without any simultaneous reduction in Naval work, from 1,000,000 to1,500,000 gross tons per annum, a further 100,000/150,000 workers in the ship-building and engineering trades would be required.10. These qualifications might legitimately justify some whittling down of the total labour estimates. But the task of labour re-distribution would still remain most formidable even if only an 80 per cent, improvement in our presentefforts over those in the last war were called for. The absence of reliable monthlyfigures of employment make it impossible to say whether the influx into thewar industries is gathering momentum or not. &quot;For what they are worth, thefigures of &quot;employment&quot; (obtained by deducting the unemployed persons from
the total of the insured population in July 1939) are shown below for the first two months of the war. They indicate an insignificant rate of inci&apos;ease, a rate which would probably be smaller if allowance were made for the men who had joined the forces.Number of Persons Employed (i.e.. Insured Persons less Unemployed)September-November 1939.September 11. December 11.1939. 1939.Engineering............      861,413 865,475Construction and repair of vehicles      500.855 503.700Other metal industries        ......      709,972 714,487The labour departments of the various Services indicate that very little dilutionhas, as yet, taken place and the Ministry of Labour reported recently* that &quot; the relaxation of Customs Agreement has not yet achieved any extensive results,having regard to the magnitude of the problem.&apos;&apos; The necessary turnover oflabour is still but a slight trickle compared with the spate that is necessary.This is not surprising. Much of the present unemployment in the engineering trades is found among men whose industrial quality, because of long periodunemployment is low. or in regions or firms which cannot easily be utilized.And whilst the present levels of consumption of the civilian population remain as high as they are at present large numbers of unemployed workers suitablefor re-training will not be available.III. Possible difficulties in the redistribution of Labour.11. Formidable obstacles will be met with in any attempt to effect a rapidtransformation in the distribution of labour.(a) Under normal conditions, the shortage of labour in the wrar industries would have produced its own remedy. Wages would have risensharply and a flow of labour would have been attracted into the properchannels. To some extent that was the method of redistributionemployed in the last war. It may well be that wage increases of anabnormal kind are now taking place in the war industries. We are,unfortunately, without any precise information on this vital question.But the present policy of the Government is to seek to restrain therise in wages and, although the war industries may still offeradvantages in the shape of increased earnings on overtime work orpayment by result, this will damp down the normal remedial influencesproduced by the working of the price system. Having regard to other major aspects of our economic policy it is patently desirable to avoid the large all-round wage increases which the Government sanctionedduring the latter part of the war of 1914-18 and which, towards theend of the war produced a dangerously inflationary condition. Never-theless, if the price system, for good reasons, is not allowed to operatefreely, some substitute for it must be found. And that substitute isnot yet in sight.(6) During the past fifteen years considerable movements of labour havetaken place from the depressed industrial areas to the south andsouth-east regions of Great Britain. These regions are particularlyvulnerable to air attack, and it is certain that during the war thenorth and west regions will regain some of their lost industrial import-ance. It will, therefore, be necessary to stem and reverse the recentgeographical trend of labour. This will create its own special difficulties. The southern districts are relatively high-wage areas, thenorthern relatively low-wage areas. The prosperity of the south inthe past decade has led to extensive purchase of houses by the wage-earning class.   It is noticeable that, already, as one of the first effects* Paper W.P. (R.) (40) 12.
LOof the war, unemployment has increased sharply in the London, South-Eastern and Southern Divisions, whilst it has fallen in the NorthMidlands, North-Western, Northern and Scotland Divisions.(c) The geographical redistribution of population will create a shortage of housing accommodation in certain areas which it may be difficult tomeet in view of the present and anticipated shortages of building materials, notably timber. In view of the large building programmes of the past twenty years this may at first sight appear surprising.But many of the new factories which will come into operation withinthe next twelve months are in relatively isolated areas, such as Yeovil.Or they have been constructed in districts where re-housing hasnot taken place on any serious scale, such as Glasgow. Or they are tobe found in areas, such as Gloucester, where recent rapid increases in population have, despite much house-building, created a chronichousing shortage. The Air Ministry appears to be particularly con-cerned lest their programme be held up through a housing shortage.They have factories in 35 areas, now employing .133,000 persons, whichwill employ an additional 130,000 workers this year and a further148,000 thereafter. The factories in Scotland may be seriouslyhampered, since the possibilities of billeting are small there and theshortage of houses marked. The Ministry of Supply has 8 newexplosive factories, 7 new filling factories. 0 new chemical plants and13 new engineering factories, which will be in operation in 1940^41,which will employ 142,000 persons.The Government is now actively examining this problem.^Billeting of industrial workers, either voluntary or compulsory; theextension of transport services to tap wider areas for workers; theconstruction of timber-economising houses, are all methods by which local shortages may be minimized. But voluntary billeting has itslimitations, compulsory billeting of industrial workers raisesimportant political considerations, and even where timber is beingeconomically employed large housing projects are still out of thequestion for the present. The housing shortage will probably con-stitute a greater obstacle to labour mobility than during the first yearsof the last war.(d) The ease with which occupational redistribution, and especially there-training of labour, can be effected will be considerably lessened bythe manner in which men are called up for the Army. Reliance uponthe system of voluntary enlistment of men for the Army means that men with a fairly wide spread in age will be found in the fighting forces. Adherence to a schedule of Reserved Occupations, with theregular calling-up of yearly groups denudes the lower age groups.Thus of the total of 4,400.000 men in the age group 18-29 years about70 per cent, are unreserved.The younger age groups are the more adaptable for purposes of re-training or change of occupations. But by the time that 2-3,000,000men are with the colours, relatively small numbers of young men willremain for training. This difficulty must be considered in relation to increasing inflexibility at the lowest end of the scale; because of thepresent age distribution of the population the number of boysarriving at the age of sixteen years will, in each year of the present war, be about 125,000 less than in the years 1914-18. Over a four yearswar the total difference would, therefore, be about 500,000.(e) The mobility of labour, as between 1914 and 1939, has been reduced bythe improved standards of Unemployment Benefit and unemployment assistance.(/) A certain degree of temporary disturbance has been created and theimmediate possibilities of dilution lessened by the withdrawal of menfrom the war industries since the war began. It appears that some per cent, of the workers in the engineering trades in July 1939 have entered the forces. The corresponding percentage for Motor vehicles and Aircraft is about 7 per cent.; for Other Metal Industries about per cent.   The experience of the Aircraft Industry is of special* Paper H.P.C. (40) 1.
interest. At the outbreak of the war the numbers employed were approximately 340,000 men. In mobilisation 21,000 men, half ofthem fully skilled, were lost to the forces. Application was made tothe Defence Departments for the suspension or release of about 11,500,but only 4,500 were released, of which only 1,000 were permanentlyreleased. Many of those retained were skilled key men so that theloss in production may have been greater than the figures of laboursuggest. This disturbing element will probably be only of shortduration. The gaps in personnel will be filled and the operation ofthe Schedule of Reserved Occupations and the supplementary devicesfor the permanent or temporary retention of men vital to productionin the war industries will probably prevent any further seriousdenudation.IV. Labour requirements and the development of our war effort.12. It would be dangerous to underestimate the increase which must takeplace in the war industries within the next nine months if the programmes ofthe Services are not to be severely restricted or to ignore the social and economicimpediments to that increase. The very persistence of the unemployment level at relatively high levels is itself proof of severe labour immobility. little importance should be attached to the fact that, from all appearances, the labour shortage is not noticeably more acute nowr than it has been for the past year.For the moment avc have been provided with a breathing space. The rapid declinein the output of domestic motor cars (perhaps the chief form of consumptionwhich has been restricted since the war began), has made immediately availablevery large numbers of workers who can be transferred quickly to the war industries. And in the very early stages of the war effort other unsuspected,temporary bottle-necks to production are inevitable. But the breathing space willbe short, and as the programmes gather momentum labour may well reveal itself as the vital scarce factor. The orders of magnitude of the estimates of the Inter-departmental Conference are probably correct, and we may, within six or nine months, be confronted with a labour problem so acute that, if no steps are takenin the interim, a violent scaling down of our immediate war effort may be demanded.13. It is equally dangerous to look upon the Interdepartmental Conferenceestimates as a target which cannot possibly be reached at any time, but whichhas value as indicating the right directions to follow. The labour estimates areone aspect of a plan, the combined plan of the Fighting Services. A plan whichis outside the bounds of possibility may be worse than no plan at all, for it helpsto create, of itself, dislocation and disproportion in the national Avar effort. Whenthe supply is hopelessly short of the combined total of a number of rival demands,no great harm is clone if the rival demands are then scaled doavn roughly in proportion. But it is more than likely, in such circumstances, that the plan*willdegenerate into a system of &quot; first come first sera-ed,&quot; avhich may produce exactly the opposite of the results required.14. If an acute labour shortage developed within the next year the obviousdisproportions in the distribution of scarce labour, avhich are likely to appear,are three :  (1) For the moment the programmes of the Air Force and the Navy appearto be progressing more rapidly than those of the Army or the Ministryof Shipping in its merchant vessel construction. The &quot; first come firstserved &quot; principle might avell mean that the tAvo former Avould be ableto stake their claims, by placing contracts and attaching firms to theirown needs, to a large proportion of the scarce labour, and thus piwentthe latter two from obtaining more than a small proportion of thelabour required in their plans. By the time that the disproportionsmade themselves evident it avould be too late to apply remedies quickly;new labour takes time to retrain, and the task of switching labour from (say) Admiralty contracts to Ministry of Supply contracts wouldbe difficult and probably very avasteful of men and materials.
\n acute shortage of engineering and related labour would probably be disastrous to the export trades in engineering products unless certainnumbers of workers were definitely earmarked for exports. Ifuncontrolled competition for labour were to develop between theFighting Services and the export trade, the scales would inevitably beweighted in favour of the former. The difficulties and inconvenienceof exporting and the constant, and understandable, pressure whichthe Services&quot;would exert to meet their urgent immediate requirements would give employers very little choice.rV shortage of labour, on an unexpected scale, might well result indisproportions and waste even within the supplies of one Service. Oneitem in supply might be met 100 per cent.; another, complementaryitem, only to the extent of 20 per cent. In this case the total produc-tion of effective units would only be 20 per cent., and 80 per cent, ofthe production of the first item would be wasted wholly or partly.15. It is necessary, therefore., to make a decision of principle. If it is decided that a shortage of labour must not occur, then positive policies must befollowed which will prevent the imminent shortage. If we decide that there willbe a substantial shortage then the whole requirements of the Fighting services must be reconsidered in order to prevent the shortage creating chaos. merely to leave events to move of their own momentum is tantamount to a decision thatno general control at all is to be exercised over the relative strengths of theFighting Services and the relative claims of other demands upon industry.16. The practical danger, it should be observed, is that of a shortage of.labour in particular industries rather than in the economic system as a whole.The occupied population of Great Britain was, in 1939, 24 per cent, greater thanin 1914. and it may be expected to increase by about 200,000 per annum in thefuture. Productivity per head is higher now than 25 years ago. In those industries vital for the prosecution of war, the metal and engineering trades,there were, in 1939, slightly more workers than in 1918, after four years of rapid expansion. Between 1923 and 1939 the numbers engaged in Metal Manufacturefell by 4 per cent., and in Shipbuilding and Shiprepairing by 35 per cent.; butin Engineering they increased by 9 per cent.; in the Construction and repair of Vehicles and Aircraft by 94 per cent., and in Other Metal Industries by57 per cent. Moreover, given very favourable circumstances, the economic system has recently revealed evidence of great resiliency. Thus, between July 1938 and july 1939, the number of insured persons engaged in Motor Vehicles, Cycles and aircraft in one year increased by 18 per cent. And the number of personsemployed over the whole field of aircraft manufacture is ten times greater thanin 1935-36, and has, over the past year, increased more than 100 per cent.17. The problem is one of mobilizing very large potential resources in sucha way as to secure a maximum output of metal and engineering products requiredby the Defence Services and, in particular, of timing the defence programmes sothat, when everything possible has been done to retrain and transfer labour,the programmes shall have a close relation to what is economically practicable.(Signed) J. JEWKES.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 27, 1940.
