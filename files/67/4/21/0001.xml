COPYWAR CABINET.NEGOTIATIONS WITH ITALYAlhA^6-!2^^ by t^e ;ec&quot;*ary of statp for ForeignATxairs ana the Minister of Economic Warfare&apos;.-We circulate herewith the draft of a Cabinet paperprepared after the Inter-Departmental discussions whichwere held in accordance with the Cabinet; oecision or23rd January (see W.M.(40) 21st Conclusions, item 11)in regard to the settlement of outstanding war trade, etc.questions with Italyd      In order to save time, it has beenprepared in the form of s joint paper to be submitted by usto the Cabinet, representing as it does the best compromise on which the Departments can be persuaded to agree.     Weregret, however, that though for this reason the memorandumbears our names, we do not feel able to recommend it to theCabinet in its present form.     And inasmuch as every day&apos;sdelay may prove of vital importance not only to ourrelations with Italy, but to Italy&apos;s whole attitude towardsthe belligerents, and thus towards the future course of theWar, we have felt constrained to adopt this somewhatunorthodox procedure in order to bring the matter before

The cabinot rather than occupy further time in an endeavourto reach complete agreement with all interested Departments.Moreover, we fear that, the discussions which have taken placehave shown that0 as was anticipated when the matter v/as recently mentioned to the Cabinet by the Foreign Secretary,the prospects of reaching such complete agreement are remoteand that accordingly the only authority which can decide an issue on which a decision is urgently necessary is the Cabinet.It appears to us, however, unlikelj^ that these proposals will prove adequate to secure an agreement with the ItalianGovernment covering not only the abandonment of German coal imports, but also the supply to Kis Majesty&apos;s Government of anti-tank gunst etc, and the approval of the ShippingAgreement-.     We suggest, therefore, thatB while the Master ofthe Rolls should endeavour to secure a settlement on thebasis proposed,., he should be authorized by the Cabinet, ifnecessary to obtain a general settlement, to bring the proposedpurchase of agricultural produce up to a total of  5 million,even though we are at present advised that it is not possibleto find a profitable use for the produce over and above theamounts mentioned in S 15.We would emphasise the great political importance ofsecuring an agreed settlement with Italy3 by which german coal imports can be stopped, without friction, and we can secure essential shipping and military suppliese and above all by which the Italian Government shall not be left in atemper of such resentment as will assuredly result from thefeeling that they have been made the objects of economicdictation,,

The question is of great urgency as the german delegation under .or. Glodius is at present negotiating in rome and in? we do not at once resume negotiations andpursue them actively, it is highly probable that theGerman Delegation will conclude agreements getting allthe more valuable produce available and leaving us with no alternative but to buy what remains.(Intlld.)

secret this DOGjJMMg Is Tm PROPERTY OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S government  NTW.P.(G)(ilO)2L** h A w T Negotiations with ItalyJoint Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign AffairsandThe Minister of Economic Warfare.Our colleagues will he aware that the master of the Rolls,  as British Chairman of the Anglo-ItalianJoint Standing Committee,  has recently &quot;been in Rome todiscuss with the Italian authorities a number of matters arising out of the effect of war conditions upon our economic and other relations with Italy.      The meetingsof the Committee,  though conducted in an atmosphere ofgood-will and cordiality,  did not seem likely to lead toa speedy settlement of the many complex questions a tissue,  and he has therefore returned to London for con-sultation and instructions,2.        We append to this paper Sir Wilfrid Greene&apos;sreport on his discussions in Rome,    It presents anilluminating picture of the delicacy of our presentrelations with Italy,  and removes the conclusion thatthe present is probably the psychological moment for&apos;giving a favourable turn to relations between Italy andthe Allies,&quot;       With that conclusion,  and with Sir Wilfrid&apos;sdiagnosis of the political background, we are in sub-stantial agreement;    and the object of this paper is toexamine the conditions under which practical effect can best be given to his recommendations.3.        The problems which confront us in our economic relations with Italy are twofold.      In the first placethere is the question of our contx-hb^nn&quot; -jontrol, which,despite recent improvements.-  acts (and in the nature ofthings is bound to some extent to continue to act) as ageneral/

general irritant.      in the second place there is thegeneral question of commercial relations between the twocountries, upon the intensification of which our political relations very largely turn.      These two aspects of thematter are dealt with in detail below.Contraband Controlk.       At the outset of the war, Italian ships,  in common withother neutral ships, were normally detained at control basespending consideration of their cargoes by the ContrabandCommittee.        The inconveniences of this method of controlwere recognised,  and a new procedure was gradualljr adopted,whereby the ship was allowed to proceed to its destination,provided that an undertaking was given that the cargo wouldnot be released to the consignees until a decision had beenreached in London, and that any item then ordered to be seized would be shipped back to an allied port for effectiveseizure.      Before the Contraband Committee reached its decision,   guarantees of non-enemy destination were usuallyexacted from the consignees:      and,  as this demanded acertain time,  the effect was that the goods on arrival weredetained,   sometimes for a considerable period, at the port of discharge.      The delay was in fact transferred from the shipat the base to the goods on the quay;    and the sum total ofirritation was not noticeably diminished.5.        nlth the double object of removing thio source of discontent and of increasing the efficacy of war contraband control,  the Master of the hells web authorized to putforward a proposal for a form of War Trade Agreement.    Underthis,  the Italian Government would undertake to encourage andempower the Corporations and other appropriate constituentsof the corporate state to enter into negotiations with us fora series of agreements, whereby,  in return for a standingguarantee against re-export to the enemy, agreed quantitiesof/

K       The principal points we have in mind are, first,  the definition of &quot;products&quot; for the purpose of the guarantee against export:secondly,  the question of manufacturered goods for which rawmaterials are derived partly from Germany and partly from overseassources;    and thirdly.,  certain problems connected with transittrade.As regards the first, we feel that it would be a matter ofgreat difficulty to define -precisely the goods which, as products of an imported raw material&quot;   would not be eligible for export toGermany;    and we suggest instead that an agreed list should bedrawn up of goods of typically domestic production which,  alone,would be eligible for export to Germany,As regards the second point,  we suggest a provision that nothing in the proposed agreement should be taken as impeding theexport/of goods would be admitted through the Contraband Controlsin specified periods.    This proposal was rejected hy theItalian Government on the ground - which must be admitted -that it amounted to a form of rationing.    Count Ciano thensuggested that we should accept instead a State guarantee against the export to Germany of imported raw materials or their products,6.        Politically,  this proposal marks a notable advanoecProm the practical point of view, however, a State guaranteepresents certain obvious disadvantages0        It would deprive us of our power over individual firms,;    it would, even if observedwith complete loyalty, facilitate the building-up of Italy1sstocks of vital raw materials:    its observance would be notless difficult to check than the present system of privateguarantees;    and its efficacy, even.if the Italian Governmentwere genuinely desirous of implementing it, would be largely dependent upon the efficiency and incorruptibility of theadministrative machine.7.        Notwithstanding these weighty objections, we neverthe-less recommend the acceptance of Count Ciano5 s of for.-  subjectto a provision enabling either party to terminate  thearrangement if desired and to the satisfactory elucidation ofa number of ones tiers of an administrative Order.*

-k-,export to Germany of goods not. otherwise eligible for-export if derived&apos;or manufactured from raw materials impcrtecrfroeaGermany;    th^-acrtualquantities of such permitted exports to be worked out in the JointCommittee.Finally, as regards trade, we shall require to satisfy ourselvesthat the necessary legislative steps have been, or will be, taken toprevent goods consigned to Italy from being declared &quot;in transit&quot; on arrival. Normal transit trade would, of course, remain outside thescope of a State guarantee and be subject to the ordinary measures of contraband control.The implications of refusal are obvious;    the risk of wide-spread evasion would only be serious if the Italian Governmentwere to embark upon a deliberate policy of forwarding contrabandto Germany;    and that risk would not in fact be increasedappreciably by the substitution of State for private guarantees.The Economic Position80        Our colleagues will be aware that the tpuestion of contra-band control in regard to Italy has,  since the outbreak of war,been regarded as being inseparable from the wider question ofour relations.,  and.-especially our commercial relations, with italy,      It was largely with the idea of improving thoserelations,  and at the same time decreasing Italian-exports.- toGermany,  that a policy of large scale purchases in Italy wasagreed upon by the Cabinet at their meeting on ,  1939(Conclusions-^^ (39)) -9-        Since that date,  the decision has been taken to exercise control of Germany&apos;s sea-borne exports;  and,  as a very large part of Italy&apos;s imports of coal are normally derived fromGermany and carried by sea,  it &quot;became apparent that export control could not be strictly applied, without grave damage toAnglo-Italian relations, unless the resulting deficiency ofcoal could be made good from this country.      Although thenecessary quantities,  in substantially the grades required,could be made available it was recognized that this additionalincrease in Italy&apos;s purchases of hu^ w-n ^Irgdhm coal would tend/

tend to increase still further the threatened AiseQuilirr^ium. inthe clearing;    and to meet this difficulty and to expedite the clearing negotiations, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador was authorizedon the . (Cabinet Conclusions- /04^(39)) to inform theItalian Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government were preparedto conclude a clearing agreement on the basis that, subject to satisfactory terms as to price and delivery, not less than 20 millions would be spent in Italy during 19h0.10.      Pending the conclusion of these negotiations, an assurance was given that,  for a limited period,  Italian sea-borne importsof coal from Germany would be allowed to continue.11.      Since, however,  it was felt that,  as a matter of tactics,the most immediate problem was that of contraband control,  thequestion of coal in relation to the clearing was allowed to takesecond place;    and it was not until the rejection of the pro-posals for a war trade agreement (see para -6   above) that it was thought advisable to bring it to a head.      That,  however,  hasnow been done,  and the Italian authorities have now come intothe open with the expected demand that, if we reduce their imports of coal from Germany, we must compensate them for the resulting reduction of their export of agricultural produce toGermany.12.      7e are therefore faeed with a situation which may besummarized as folio./s:1) 7e cannot, without grave inconsistency and withoutinviting accusations of discrimination from the U.S.A., andother neutrals,   allow the present exemption of German exportsof coal to Italy to continue.2) The interruption of those exports ,;ou]M not merelydeprive Italy of a raw material essential to the economic life of the country but also result in her losing a part atleast/

least of her market for fruit and. vegetables in Germany.3) We therefore cannot, without seriously endangering ourrelations with Italy,  interrupt her sea-borne supplies of coal fromGermany, unless we can ourselves make up the deficiency and unlessat the same time we are prepared to offer appropriate compensationfor the diminution of her German market for agricultural produce.h1 :7e can without undue difficulty supply the necessaryquantities - though not perhaps trie precise qualities - of coal(though there are other and perhaps equally advantageous markets),but we cannot,  simply by manipulation of the import restrictions,buy sufficient agricultural produce to ensure a friendly settlement.5) Without such a settlement,  the whole complex programmerepresented by the objects of the clearint  negotiations will,  inour opinion,  inevitably come to nothing, and the prospects of placing our relations with Italy on a solid basis of self-interestwill be seriously jeopardized.      A possibly valuable source ofwar materials will be lost,  and a serious crisis will confront us as soon as our declared intention of stopping German exports is put into effect.13.      In these circumstances, we are forced to the conclusionthat, notwithstanding the obvious disadvantages of buying goods which we do not need in order to enable Italy to buy coal which wecould without difficulty sell elsewhere,  it is politically essentialto offer to make substantial purchases of fruit and vegetables in italy.1h.      To minimize the disadvantages, we suggest that these additionalpurchases should be made conditional upon the supply of certain war materials which we require but which the Italian Government is atpresent refusing to supply.      /part from this proviso,  the amountof the purchases-,  if they are to be effective, must bear areasonable relation to the value of the coal which Italy will nolonger be able to obtain from Germany.      In 193^ Italian purchases of German/

of German coal and German purchases of Italian fruit and vegetablesbalanced approximately at between  10 and  11 millions.      The formerwill be roughly halved,  so that Italy stands to lose a marketvalued at something over  5 million.      Although,  of course,  it doesnot necessarily follow that Germany will in fact reduce herpurchases to that extent,  there would be obvious advantages inoffering to buy fruit and vegetables ourselves to the full amount.Apart from the political importance of such an offer,  a purchase onthis scale would have a high pre-emption value.      Nevertheless,  thedifficulties in making additional purchases of this extent seeminsuperable.      The disposal of the goods would present grave diffi-culty;    and the effect upon other neutral suppliers and,  indeed,upon our own and other Empire producers, might be extremely damaging.15-      In these circumstances,  the departments concerned agree,  andwe are prepared to recommend,  that our nf^ar should take the followingform:1 )    To purchase rice, and olive oil to an estimated value of ............  1,500,0002)    To assist in finding a market,additional to the present intake,for fruit and vegetables to an estimated value &quot;of . 7. . V..............  1,000,0003) To take any available quantities of feeding-stuffs,,  and possibly certain other processed produce.16.      it would be made clear that all purchases would be on ac.i.f. basis,  and that it would be for the Italians to arrangetransport and shipping as necessary.      &apos;/e hope that it may be possibleto induce the French Government to make some further purchases whichwould materially assist the course of the negotiations.      But,  evenif they do not,  we consider that our proposals by themselves stand areasonable chance of acceptance.Summary of recommendations.17.      If this suggestion is approved,  it should, we suggest, be made clear/

clear to the Italian Government that our proposals must be taken asa /hole,  and that they stand or fall together.      In other words, weshould offer a general settlement of outstanding questions on thefollowing lines:1) Acceptance in principle of the Italian offer of a ^tateguarantee for contraband control purposes, subject to the satis-factory elucidation of the questions referred to in para.  7 above;2) Italy to cease to import German coal by sea by a specifieddate;3) The United Kingdom to purchase.  or assist in finding a market for,  specified prodhice to a value of  &apos;?.&apos; 5 millions in additionto the amounts which,,  given the present import restrictions, Italycould reasonably expect to sell to this country in 19h0;    the delegation to have authority to increase this amount to  3*5nillions if produce which we require is available;    these offers tobe conditional upon the Italian Government waiving their objectionsto the supply of certain war material which we require.h) The United Kingdom to make available in 19h0 not lessthan 8&quot;3 million tons of coal,  provided that firm orders are placed by a specified date;5) Clearing negotiations allowing for these purchases to becompleted within a specified period;6) The two shipping agreements already agreed with the Italianshipowners to be signed and brought into force at once.1o.      We ask our colleagues to agree to these proposals and to invite the Master of the Rolls to return to Rome to lay them beforethe Italian Government.

Annex.MOST SECRET.MEHORAHDUF BY THE kASTaR OF THE ROLLS.1.        Any hope of securing the direct and active participation of Italy in the war against Germany is likely to be disappointed.   Twenty German divisions on the Brenner and allied control of the Straits and the Suez Canal will always answer the questions, will Italy come into the war?and if so on which side?   She may come in when one side or the other looks like being well beaten, but thatis another story..2.        The general attitude of the people and the Governmentis one of growing (and in many quarters intense) dislike ofthe Germans coupled with fear and of growing (but inmany quarters still mistrustful) sympathy for the Allies.They are determined to keep out of this war and to be strong at the end of it - in fact they hope to win the warwithout taking part in it.   In Mussolini&apos;s mind the axisis bound up with the memory of sanctions which he is not likely to forget or forgive.   But this does not mean that he cannot be helpful.   Count Ciano was grosslyinsulted by the Germans which he in turn is not likelyto forget or forgive.   He would like to see the Germanschastised for this and a favourable attitude towards theAllies is the best way of securing it.3.        Quite apart from the material interests of Italy thereis the very important matter of pretige and amourpropre which has a profound effect on the views and policy of people and Government from top to bottom.   they expect/

when/expect to be treated as strong, warlike and trustworthy.The Germans treated them as though they had none of these qualities and in effect told them as much.This is one good reason for their present dislike ofthe Germans - Latin races do not easily forget anaffront of this kind.   The Allies have a great opportunityof regaining the sympathy and trust of the Italians ifthey are prepared to seize the opportunity which theGermans in their clumsiness threw av/ay.   anything which reminds the Italians of their weakness (e.g.the recent deplorable article in the Evening Standard)anything which suggests that they are not trustworthyproduces an instant and violent explosion.   We cannotbribe the Italian Government with concrete things:but we can use a more subtle form of bribery by treatingthem as equals who are worthy of trust.   If we show thatwe trust them they will probably prove to be 75 per centtrustworthy although in a really big crisis they would very likely let us down if it was of vital and decisiveimportance to them to do so:    if we let them think thatwe do not trust them the percentage will drop to something nearer 25.4.        The process of securing the sympathy and co-operationof Italy in matters where they will be useful and possible requires time and patience.   Italy is like a sensitive and mistrustful horse and will shy at anysudden movement which she does not understand.   this does not mean that she is not to be treated with firmness

when the occasion demands it.     The Italians admirefirmness when applied properly and not in the German way.Although active participation by Italy in the war against Germany is out of the question, unless somethingunforeseen happens, there are two respects in which her co-operation can be obtained (a) in matters directly bearing on the war with Germany such as commercial agreements andcontraband control (b) in matters affecting Russia,the Balkans and the ultimate settlement of Europe.With regard to (b) we may well be able to have her movingon lines parallel to our own, which v/ould be ofinestimable importance.     If this co-operation is to be secured it is essential to have a clear viewof Italian interests and Italian susceptibilities and atthe sane time to find legitimate means of linking them with ourselves b&quot;r agreements and understandings on matters of mutual interest which do not too directly and obviouslyset them in opposition to Germany.     By this means they maybe brought to see that on the long view their realinterest lies in association with the Allies whom they shouldbe gradually taught to trust and respect.A matter which requires watching is the in rained andirresistible tendency of the French to administer pin-pricksto the Italians and to say caustic things to and about them.It remains to consider the two pending questions ofcommercial agreement and contraband control in the light ofthese considerations.     The commercial negotiations are bound/

bound up with the- stoppage of sea-borne coal exports fromGermany.     It is of vital importance that this stoppageshould be effected without friction between the italians and ourselves, if possible.     This means that we must supply the coal ourselves.    The Italians doubt our ability to do this, either in quantity or in quality.     V/e must get rid of these doubts.     But in addition the Italians must be ableto pay for the coal.     This they could do if we could spend the necessary amount In Italy on commodities that we want.But we shall almost certainly be unable to do this owing tothe inability or unwillingness of the Italians to sell uswhat we want.     The only way out of this, difficulty is to buy the only available goods which they have viz. the horticultural produce with which they previously paid forthe sea-borne coal.     Such a purchase v/ould moreover (a)prevent a serious .loss to the Italian farmers and peasants(b) if the Germans were still willing to take this produce,stop an important supply of foodstuff to Germany.    (It ispossible that the Germans might buy this produce out of the-^lto-Adige compensation moneys).As to contraband control, the scheme for an elasticrationing system which we proposed was emphaticallyand finally rejected by Mussolini himself.     He himselfauthorised Count Ciano to put forward the counter-proposal ofah Italian Government guarantee against export to germany of raw materials imported into Italy or their products.The political importance of this proposal is   bviously great and was specially referred to by Count Ciano himself. To havethe Italian Government bound to us by such an undertaking wouldby/

by itself be a considerable step forward in our relations with italy and is a matter to which full weight must be givenagainst any inconveniences which might ensue from the narrowerpoint of view of effective contraband control.    Moreover our acceptance of the proposal would increase the self-esteem ofthe Italians:   its rejection would imply that we distrustedeither their word or their capacity to give effect to it.In considering the proposal from the point of view of effective contraband control certain points must be borne inmind.     First, the Government guarantee could only extend to goods consigned to Italian consignees as their ostensiblyultimate destination - it could not, any more than did ourown proposal, cover goods in transit to neighbouring neutral countries which would have to be dealt with as at present.Secondly, the practical value of the guarantee must, apartfrom the question of the good faith of the Italian Government,depend on the effective working of its organisation for giving effect to it (viz. the withholding of export licences).     Thisshould not present insuperable difficulty.     The importationinto Italy of all important raw materials is strictlycontrolled and is governed by the requirements of the home and export markets, the amount of foreign exchange available fortheir purchase, the state of clearing accounts etc     Itwould scarcely be to the interest of the Italian Government touse foreign exchange to &quot;urchase raw material for the purposeof selling it or its products for marks.     It would appeartherefore that the Italian Government has good reasons for working its system of export control in such a manner asto give effect to its undertaking,     If to the undertakingthere were added a promise to investigate and deal with anysuspicious/

suspicious oases notified, &quot;by us a useful ex post facto checkwould be provided.The opinion in Rome both of the British and of the Frenchembassy is that leakages of contraband into Germany in respect ofimports consigned to Italian consignees (other than forwardingagents) are comparatively small in importance and that suchcontraband as does get through is to be found among transit goods.It must be remembered too that Italy has two objects viz. toincrease her own war stocks and also to extend her export tradeand that accordingly figures showing a rise in the level of imported raw materials are no sound basis for the inference thatany substantial amount is going to Germany either in a manufacturedor in an unmanufactured form.   It is not legitimate to use themachinery of contraband control for the purpose of thwartingeither of these objects.Another important consideration is that by accepting theproposal one source of friction will be removed, an enddesirable in itself.   It was to achieve this end that our cwnproposal was put forward.   The holding up of raw materials urgently needed by Italian factories has led and will continue to lead to much ill-will.I may summarise my conclusions as follows:-An opportunity is presented of giving a favourable turn to relations between Italy and the Allies, not with a view toprocuring the direct participation of Italy in the war, but with a view to linking her policy to our cwn in regard tocollateral matters, securing her confidence and goodwill, and bringing her to the belief that upon matters :f ultimateimportance her interests will prove to be the same as ours.If this is an object which is regarded favourably by HisMajesty&apos;s

W.G.22nd January 1940.Majesty&apos;s Government the atmosphere in which it should be pursued is one of careful regard for Italian interests andsusceptibilities.   Incidents likely to give rise to friction and an attitude which might appear to treat Italian prestige and amour propre with insufficient respect are equally to be avoided.   Moreover regard must be had to the needs of Italianinternal economy and to the fact that her population ispredominantly rural in character.5.        It is against this background that the commercial negotiations and the question of contraband control must beconsidered.   The key to the former is the purchase ofhorticultural products which should at one and the same timeremove the possibility of friction arising from our stoppage of German coal and procure an outlet for a class of Italianproduce which has a social and political importance in Italyout of all proportion to its intrinsic value.4.        With regard to contraband control the acceptance of mussolini&apos;s proposal in principle would be of great political importance and the risk of leakage is one which it would bewell worth while to run.   The extent to which that proposal could be fortified by additional safeguards is a technicalmatter which I do not discuss here.   But in proposingadditional safeguards it will be most undesirable to putforward any suggestion which might be interpreted as throwingdoubt on the good faith of the Italian Government or theefficiency of its organisation.
