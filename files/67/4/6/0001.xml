0u-    25E C R E T,.P.(G)( 40) 6,COPY NO.mR CABINET.SECURITY OF GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS.Note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.Before the present war, a review of ServiceIpublications v/as initiated by the Sub-Committee on IndustriiIntelligence in Foreign Countries,  (now dissolved),of the   committee of Imperial Defence, as the result of which theService Departments took active steps to withdraw some oftheir publications from sale and to delete from othersinformation which would be of military value to foreigncountries.This pre-war review v/as limited to Servicepublications and did not extend to the publications of civil departments,which in peace would, no doubt, have wished tocontinue printing and placing on sale reports of statisticsand so forth, required by the general public for various andgood reasonso      In war, however,  statistics and informationof a like nature may be of great value to the enemy,  and for security reasons should be issued only for official usewithin Departments.-Doubtless Ministers concerned have already taken action to suspend publication of material of this kind, butI venture to draw the attention of my colleagues to thequestion because of its great importance.     No doubt theService Departments and the Ministry of Economic Warfarewould be prepared to give advice regarding continuance of publication in doubtful cases.(Initialled)G,Richmond Terrace, S.W.1*,8th January,  1940s
