c this  document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,i SECRET.lff.P.G.  (40) (31). COPY NO.     / war    CABINET.Supply capacity Bast of the Mediterranean.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.The War Cabinet at its meeting of 15th January,  1940,asked for a report on the possibility of developing supply capacityeast of the Mediterranean (W.M.(40)  14th Conclusions, Minute 2(H)).It is assumed that supply for any expeditionary force whichit rriay be decided to constitute for operations in the Middle Eastmust be envisaged as forming part of the supply of such total numberof divisions as may be authorised by the War Cabinet for the army as a whole;    and that therefore the supply problem is primarily aquestion of diversion.For operations in the Middle East the scales of equipment and rates of wastage may differ considerably from those used for theForces on the Western Front.      The War Office have been asked toconsider this aspect and provide the Ministry of Supply v/ith an approximate estimate of the changes in requirements which would be involved.The Ministry of Supply is at the oresent time faced witha problem of supply which entails making the fullest possible useof productive capacity for munitions stores at home,  in theDominions,  in India and in the United States,  and furtherinvolves drawing on neutral countries as far as practicable.It is aiming at utilising all existing capacity surplus to domestic requirements wherever such capacity is to be found, bu1so far has not,  except in the United Kingdom and Canada,undertaken programmes involving the increasing of existingcapacity,  except to the extent to which the giving of orders for full output of existing capacity does this automatically.      InIndia, however,  the programme of enlargement of the IndianOrdnance Factories contemplated under the recommendations ofthe Chatfield Commission is being proceeded with as far as- /possible

possible,  and in addition the question of increasing Indianfactory capacity for small arm ammunition is at present underconsideration.      Similarly in Australia the commonwealth government&apos;s programme, which involves certain factoryextensions,  is also being pressed forward.      For any additionalprogrammes of expansion of capacity in India and Australia orany other countries East of Suez, the time factor entersseriously into account;    and any effective contribution to production by such measures is not likely to take effect until considerably later than would be the case at home.The effect of steps taken to date is that themaximum production effort available in India, Australia andSouth Africa has been taken into account in the productionplan.      This effort can, by diversion to the Middle East, bemade available for any force detached for service there, but,in the case of armaments more particularly, no more can beexpected from these sources except by the creation of new capacity unlikely to be effective till after 15 to 18 months from the order to build being given.Orders to the value of approximately  7 millions havealready been placed in India and Australia, mainlv for gun ammunition, small arm ammunition, 3.7&quot; A*A.  equipments (inAustralia), rifles and explosives (in small quantities.      this programme is being added to as necessary to get the maximumoutput available over and above the requirements of theGovernment of India and the Commonwealth of Australiarespectively.      Under present arrangements deliveries On these orders are being made to this country (or direct to the B.E.F.in France).With regard to Vote 7 and Vote 8 Stores (Clothing andGeneral Stores) the productive capacity at home, is more able tosupply requirements,  and while it would be possible to obtain/considerably

considerably more of such stores from countries east of Suez,the decision to do so at the expense of home production must hebased on strategical and not on economical grounds,      planning to obtain a larger proportion of these stores in the East is- inprogress, but actual orders have not been placed as yet exceptfor specialised stores such as tropical clothing, or for storesfor which countries east of Suez are the natural centres ofproduction.The special case of Palestine has received very careful attention as a possible source of production for theEastern Army.     After full enquiries the conclusion has beenreached that,  except as a source of certain supplies indigenousto the country, such as potash, Palestine cannot be regarded asa source of production nor could it be developed for thispurpose within any reasonable time.It is, however, considered that the labour availablein Palestine,  and certain facilities in existence there, wouldmake it suitable to carry out Line of Communication (i.e.  3rdLine Heavy) repairs for armament,  clothing and general stores fora force up to 8 or 10 Divisions based upon it.     Furthermore, itwould be suitable as an area in which to site Base Store Depotsfrom which to feed a force in the Middle East, and to whichmaterial prodxiced in countries east of Suez or from home via the cape,  could be consigned.It is therefore suggested that steps should be taken toorganise Palestine as a Base Area under the Control of the Armyin the Middle East.      The possibilities of developing supply in Palestine for Vote 7 and vote 8 (Clothing and General Stores)is under investigation.The conclusions which I suggest on the matter are asfollows&apos;: -AD

(i) that I should he furnished quickly with the necessary information as to requirements for an Army in the middle east.(ii) that if the use of this Army is contemplated within aperiod of less than 15-18 months, it will have to rely for munitions stores upon present production arrangements,subject to diversion from India and Australia to the near east of stores now on order or which can be placed on orderthere.(iii) that in forming plans for the obtaining of Vote 7 and vote 8 Stores (Clothing and General Stores), I should be instructed whether I am to arrange for increased development,especially in India, where I find it practicable,(iv) that Palestine should be dealt with as above suggested. -(v)    In view of (i) above I have not consulted the Minister ofShipping.The Adelphi,37th January 1940.(Initd) E.L.B.
