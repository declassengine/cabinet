THE AGREEMENT WITH FRANCE ON i:v[PQRT RESTRICTIONS.1. The agreement between the United Kingdom and France whichwas initialled on 10th February, makes possible, except in afew respects,the restoration of the prewar volume of trade asbetween ourselves and France, so far as concerns goods subjectto the import restrictions which both Governments found itnecessary to introduce at the outbreak of war.2, The line taken bjr the French Government has been thatin the light of the Financial Agreement of December last,which precludes restrictions on either protective or exchangegrounds, we ought to abolish all the restrictions on importsfrom France while France should return to the prewar quota system applicable to imports from the United Kingdom,3. An unqualified return to the prewar position would havemeant that certain of our exports would be restricted onimportation into France (some 17f3 of our total exports toFrance, excluding coal, on 193G figures), whereas there wouldbe practically no quantitive restriction on imports from France,4. We were not able to agree to the French suggestion of the removal of all restrictions because:-(a) we are proposing to efx^ect a reduction of home production and consumption of certain non-essential goods, and could not afford to see the reductionnullified, or our manufacturers placed at an unfair disadvantage, by increased imports from Franceand(b) we cannot in general allow France besides recovering her own prewar trade, to have a free run of the prewartrade of other countries, which continues to be prohibited by our import restrictions.5,     paragraphs 1 to 3 of the Agreement provide in the caseof imports from France for unrestricted importation, except inrespect of goods which are specified in Lists I and II. imports in these Lists are restricted to:-

(a) in most cases tlie prewar level of quantity;additions may be made to List I in case of necessity afterconsviltation with the French,or     (b) something less than the prewar level, i.e. in thecase of confectionery, strawberries, bulbs, flowers, plants andmotorcars and parts; linen manufactures are to be prohibitedaltogether.Paragraph 1+. provides in the case of imports into France from theUnited Kingdom for:unrestricted importation whore the goods were not subjectto quota on the outbreak of war.     Where they were subjectto such restriction imports will be permitted up to atleast the prewar quota level. There is also a short list ofgoods, most of which were unrestricted before the war,which will now be subjected to some measure of restriction.Linen goods and motor cars are included in List III at50 per cent, of the prewar level.6.    The area within which there will be reduction below theprewar level is, on 1938 figures, ver^r small on both sides inrelation to total imports (less than lfr in the case of UnitedKingdom exports and        in the case of imports from France)7.    There still remains outstanding the question of exportsof manufactured tobacco from the United Kingdom to Prance(worth some  110,000 in 1938).    The French have offered an assurance that imports will be allowed into France up to thepre-war level, subject to certain conditions which are now underinvestigation.  (A quota of 100^o of 1938 imports is provided forin the Agreement).8.    Paragraph 5 of the Agreement enables us to restrict imports in connexion with any scheme of restriction of internalproduction, sale or consumption.    This covers certain rawmaterials and foodstuffs which are subject to import licensingin connexion with a scheme of control in this country.

9. The Agreement is to enter into force on 1st March andis to remain in force in the first instance until 1st July,and thereafter for further quarterly periods, subject to one month&apos;s notice.10,An important statement which was made by the french to the effect that they hoped to dispense as soon as possible with the licensing formalities in respect of those importsfrom the United Kingdom which would not be subject toquantitative limitation, is recorded in the proces-verbalannexed to the Agreement.11. The United Kingdom and French representatives also agreed upon certain proces-verbaux concerning:-(a) proposals relating to trade between the two Empires(b) wines and spirits(c) price control.These were agreed with the Departments concerned.IS. As to (a) there is an undertaking to recommend tothe Colonial Governments that they should adtiit Frenchmetropolitan and colonial goods freely, subject to certain exceptions which would have to be agreed.     As regards colonial territories subject to special treaty re&apos;gimes (providing fornon-discrimination and in some instances - the Congo Basinand Morocco - for freedom of trade) , the position isreserved pending examination of the issues involved, butthe most favourable treatment possible is recommended.The United Kingdom representatives placed on record theimportance to United Kingdom export trade of certain classesof goods in &apos; brocco and Syria, particularly cotton goods,13. As to trade between France and the Dominions, theindependence of the Governments of the latter is stressed,but an undertaking is given that we will communicate to theDominions the substance of the present Agreement, and so faras possible use our good offices with them.

As regards India and Burma, the United kingdom representatives gave an assurance that action similar to thattaken in the United Kingdom would he taken if import restrictions were introduced, and they expressed the hope thata regime no less favourable than that applied to Frenchproducts would be applied in France and the French Empire tothe products of India and Burma.15.    In a proces-verbal relating to wines and spirits theUnited Kingdom representatives undertook that wines and spiritsof French origin would not be subjected to any system of restriction by import licensing.     As regards duties they undertook only that the United Kingdom Government would enter into prior consultation with the French Government if any alteration of the duties was contemplated.    (This arose from a complaint by the French that in our last Budget we violated theundertaking not to increase these duties which is contained inthe Trade Agreement of 193m-. )16.    The proc^s-verbal relating to     price control places on record the anxiety of the French representatives concerning thepossible effect of price control in this country on theimportation of French specialities of high quality.     TheUnited Kingdom representatives express the conviction thatsympathetic consideration would be given in cases of importanceto French export trade.17.    as publication might give rise to embarrassing demands from neutrals, it has been agreed that the Agreement shouldbe kept confidential,   a fairly full press cormiunique will beissued.Board of Trade.lhth February, 19hO.
