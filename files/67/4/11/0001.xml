I.    INTRODUCTORY.At their meeting held on the 22nd December,  1950,,(W.P.(39) 122nd Conclusions, Minute 2) I v/as invited to review the present shipping position, and after eonsul-tation with the Ministers concerned I nov/ submit thefollowing preliminary report which deals with one aspect of the question which is both urgent and of such a nature that it could, and in my opinion should, be dealtwith without reference to other possible methods of meeting the present situation.     Broadly speaking, thereare three main directions in which it is possible to look for relief in our present difficulties, namely:-(a) a more economical use of existing shipping facilities (e.g. such questions as possible improvements in routeing, more rapid convoys,chartering of additional neutral tonnage,possibility of arranging for the tranship-ment of cargoes, improved arrangements forship repairing and other miscellaneousmatters;(b) an increase in the rate of merchant ship-building, principally in the United Kingdom,but possibly also to some extent on thiscountry&apos;s account in the Dominions, Coloniesor even foreign countries:(c) a reduction of the volume and weight of non-essential imports into this country for home consumption.2. The first class of remedy (remedy (a) above)involves the detailed consideration in conjunction withthe Departments concerned of a large  number of highlytechnical questions.      Each of these is being closelyinvestigated at the present time, and I hope to be ableto submit a comprehensive report on this aspect of thequestion at an early date.3. The third remedy (remedy (c)  above) has alreadybeen applied to a considerable extent through the im-position of both our import prohibitions in particular cases and more generally through the system of import licensing.      There are, no doubt, directions in which thispolicy could be extended with consequent advantage to our shipping capacity and without causing any undue incon-venience and hardship in this country.     It may well bethat as the war progresses we may be forced to apply thisremedy in far more drastic forms, even to the extent of excluding all imports into this country other than those-absolutely essential to our war effort.      The extent towhich we need tread this path at the present time depends on the estimate which we form on the one hand of theshipping sp0&apos;&quot;-, ^v^llable for imports of all kinds duringthe nexL L..^lve months, and   on the other hand of the

tonnage and volume of essential imports (i.e. rawmaterials and food stuffs essential for the service programmes, for necessary exports and for essentialdomestic needs).      These are matters on which I am inclose consultation with the Ministers concerned, and hope to he able to submit a full report in the nearfuture.4. There remains the possibility (remedy (b) above)Of increasing, by additioncl shipbuilding, our capacity to import goods from abroad.     The urgency of thisparticular remedy is to be found in the fact that it isof a quasi-long period character.     If we are to takeradical measures for improving the situation in thisdirection .WO -should act ho-th. promptly and. cLaoiaivoiy,

II.    THE MERCHANT SHIPBUILDING programmes to BE CARRIED OUT.5. At the present time merchant shipbuilding in thiscountry is proceeding at approximately the rate of730,000 gross tons per annum, exclusive of about 80,000tons of tankers.      This output includes vessels orderedon private account, of which a substantial quantity wasunder construction at the outbreak of the v/ar.     The&quot;target&quot; programme laid down by the Government before thev/ar, v/hich is now being worked up to, is an annual outputof one million gross tons.      It is anticipated that under existing arrangements this rate of output will be attainedat some date during the coming spring, but that the total output in the twelve months ending 31st August   next willnot exceed 800,000 tons.      The fact that the million rateof output has not yet been attained is due partly (a) tothe fact that on the outbreak of war the Admiralty tookup for urgent naval work a number of merchant yardswhich under the pre-war plan had been reserved for merchant shipbuilding,  (b) to shortages of labour incertain essential trades in the shipbuilding industry,and (c) more recently to shortage of steel.6. At the time when the Government laid down the&quot;target&quot; programme of one million gross tons of merchantshipping to be built annually, we were still living in a peace atmosphere0      In the conditions of war, however,in which we now find ourselves, I am convinced that weshould set our hands to securing an output of merchantshipping at a much higher rate than we have contemplatedhitherto.7. It is true that large quantities of steel arerequired for shipbuilding and that till the ship islaunched there is a net reduction of steel available for essential v/ar purposes;    but every ship, once launched,produces a very rapid return through the increasedcarrying capacity which she provides,  since every ton ofsteel employed in shipbuilding gives nearly four tons ofdeadweight shipping capacity which can carry to thiscountry over twelve tons of goods per annum.      If the orerequired for making the steel employed in shipbuildingwas specially imported for the purpose, the net increasedcarrying capacity made available to this country in thefirst year after the launching of the ship would representa return fo some 550 per cent, while, if the steel usedfor building the ship were imported into this country from the IMS.A. in the form of bullets, the return in theform of increased carrying capacitor would amount to asmuch as 1,100 per cent.      Prom the point of view ofsecuring relief from our shipping difficulties, thereare hardly any limits to the extent to which in war time it is to &quot;the national advantage to increase our output ofmerchant tonnage;     For the possession of such tonnageis not only of value for the purpose of providing the carrying capacity not otherwise obtainable, since, evenif output could be raised up to the full extent required for for that purpose, it would be to the national advantageon balance, still further to increase our merchant fleet,since to do so would enable us to dispense with the needfor chartering neutral tonnage on disadvantageous termsor even perhaps to re-employ some of our shipping in

neutral trades, thereby giving us valuable additionalforeign exchange receipts.      Only if and when it became clear that the war v/as within a year of its end, would itbe uneconomic to continue the building of merchant ships.8. Quite clearly, therefore, the limiting feature in determining what should be the size of our merchant ship-building programme is not the extent to v/hich we couldemploy merchant tonnage if we had it.     The real diffi-culties are of a severely practical nature and are to befound in the limitations imposed by the extent of ourshipbuilding capacity, by the supplies of steel which canbe allocated to shipbuilding, and by the amount of ship-building and engineering labour which can be madeavailable,9. After careful consideration, I have reached theconclusion that the Government should now set themselves the task of securing an annual output of not less thanone-an^-a-half million gross tons of merchant shipping.By this I mean that at the expiry   of twelve months fromthe date on which a decision to this effect is taken bythe War Cabinet, output of merchant tonnage of all typesshould have attained that rate.     This is a formidabletarget, and one which implies that in the seventeenthmonth of the war, our output of merchant tonnage would be almost exactly double that at the present time.     Even so,the rate v/ould be no more than sufficient to make good the gross loss of tonnage due to enemy action, if in thenext twelve months losses were to continue at the ratesustained in the first four months of the war.10.       I consider that it should be possible to achieve a programme of this magnitude, but this will only beSecured at the cost of a greet and concerted effort onthe part of the Ministry of Shipping, combined with themost wholehearted and active co-operation of all other government Departments concerned.III.    THE MAIN DIFFICULTIES TO BE OVERCOME IFTHE PROPOSED SHIPBUILDING PROGRAMME ISTO BE ACHIEVED.(a) Shipbuilding capacity.11.       Prior to the outbreak of the present war anarrangement had been made by which in effect shipbuilding capacity was divided approximately equally for thebuilding (a) of Naval vessels and (b) of merchant shippingcapacity equivalent to about one million gross tons beingallotted to each purpose.      The capacity allotted to the-Navy consisted, in addition to the peace-time Navaldockyards, mainly of yards which were specially equipped for building naval vessels and were familiar generally with naval requirements.      In the case of a number oflarge yards, arrangements were made for capacity to be divided in agreed proportions between the Navy and merchant shipbuilding.     This pre-war settlement did not,however,  succeed in meeting the strain imposed by theoutbreak of the war, with the result that a number of

berths allocated for merchant shipbuilding were taken upfor naval purposes.     Sufficient time has not yet elapsedto enable these to be returned to merchant shipbuilding.In addition, a very large amount of ship conversionrequired on the outbreak of war resulted in furtherinroads being made on the shipbuilding capacity allottedunder the scheme to merchant shipbuilding.     An exomina-tion of the wages paid for conversion work suggests that capacity equivalent to 280,000 gross tons has been taken up for this purpose.     No considerable relief under this head is apparently anticipated by the Admiralty, at least for some time;   but in view of the really vital need forsecuring a substantial increase in our merchant tonnage,I hope that special efforts will be made by the admiralty to assist in this v/ay.12.     The total shipbuilding capacity of this country is approximately 2,500,000 gross tons;   but not all the yardsare at present in use.      Since the present naval programmetakes up a building capacity of one million gross tons,an increase in merchant shipbuilding to the rate of one-and-a-half million tons per annum would certainly mean that full use would need to be made of every availablemerchant yard.     It might well mean also, that it wouldbe found necessary to re-open some of the redundant yardswhich, since the last war, the shipping industry have acquired (through Shipbuilders Security Ltd,) for the express purpose of ensuring that they should never bere-opened;     Proposals to re-open such ^ards wouldcertainly need to be discussed with the ship-owners;    andfor this reason and on account of the labour problems which might well be involved, the first drive for anincrease in the rate of our merchant ship-building mightbe concentrated upon securing the maximum use of existingyards, by no means all of which are full at the presenttime.13.       The whole-hearted co-operation, both of shipownersand of shipbuilders will be essential to the success ofthe programme now recommended, even though, as I thinkwill be essential, the great bulk, if not the whole, ofthe additional shipping proposed is built on direct government account.      I do not doubt that this co-operation will be forthcoming;   but the shipowners may be expectedto ask that reasonable assurances should be given tothem as to the way in v/hich the Government would proposeat the end of the war to dispose of the large merchantfleet which they would have acquired under the building programme now recommended.      I do not see v/hy this and similar questions should prove difficult of settlement;   but I am concerned to point out that,if the million-and^a-half ton programme is to be achievedwithin one year from now it is essential that a

settlement on these questions should he reached betweenthe Government and the shipowners with the utmost despatch,and that on no account should discussions on these mattersbe allowed to hold up the launching of the merchant ship-building programme now proposed.(b) The steel required and the stepsrequired to be taken to ensure supplies,14. Under the present target programme of ^nemillion tons cf merchant shipbuilding, the steel, required(together with Certain provision for repair work) amountsto approximately 750,000 tons per annum.      If the outputof new ships is increased to one and a half million tons per annum, as I suggest, the amount of steel required for merchant shipbuilding would be increased to 1,100,000 tons.15, Undor the order of preference laid down by theMinistry cf Supply, steel for merchant shipbuilding(whether on Government or on private accunt) is givensecond preference, in common with the direct requirementsof Government Departments in general, while the firstpreference is reserved exclusively for the FightingServices.      Experience shews that the present arrangements are not sufficient to ensure a steady delivery to the shipyards of steel, particularly plates and sections,.The result is that the building of merchant shipping isbeing unnecessarily delayed.      Further,  the delay^s in the delivery of steel to the shipyards are having a bad effecton labour, since first in one yard and then in another,riveters and platers already are being stood off fr-mtime to time owing to lack of material on which to work,16. Everyone is agreed that the difficulties to be overcome in securing the shipyard labour required tomaintain the programme of a million and a half tens perannum, which in any case were very great, will virtuallyinsuperable, unless the Ministry of Shipping is in aposition to offer the most categorical guarantees both tothe employers and to the work people that, if betweenthem they secure that the necessary labour is available,there will be no unemployment or under-empl&quot;ymentconsequent upon insufficient or irregular deliveries ofsteel to the shipyards.      In my vi^w, therefore, it isessential that, as part of the programme which I recommend,the Government should take adequate steps to ensure thatthe steel required is forthcoming at the right time,  inthe right quantities,  and in the right places.17* As regards the steel required, I c -nsider thatwe should now lay down that the priority t   be accorded tosteel for use in merchant shipbuilding should be equal tothat accorded to steel required by the Admiralty for navalconstructionj in other words,    that the highest priority should be given tc  steel for merchant shipbuilding.      Theabeve is the formula adopted with success by the government during the last war, and I dc not think that we canimprove upon it.      Having thus laid down the principles

to &quot;be foii-.wecL in allocating or supplying steel for merchantshiphuildingj the Government should then, through theMinister cf Supply, issue directions fcr the allocation bythe Steel Controller to the merchant, shipbuilding industry of the amount cf steel required, namely, 1,100,000 tons.At the same time, the Minister of Shipping should supply to the Steel Controller particulars of the various types of steel required and the dates upon v/hich, and the yardsto which, supplies should be made available over a periodof twelve months in   rder to enable the programme to becarried :ut in full.      The same principles should be applied in allotting priority for materials in the engineering trades required f-r the manufacture of machinery and other equipment f.;r merchant vessels.(c)   The labour required fcr thepregramme proposeda18a The report -f the Interdepartmental Committee on man Pov/er which has recently been circulated to the WarCabinet by the Chancellor of the Exchequer under cover of paper W.P.(G,)(40)9, shows that,  on the basis of thepresent programmes5  the numbers of skilled and unskilledwork people (a) available last Autumn, and (b) requiredin July - September of this year and consequently (c) the deficiencies of lab.ur in the classes of labour with whichthe Admiraloy and the Ministry cf Shipping are concerned are as follows:-Numbers required Numbers avail- Deficiencies.July/September,    able Autumn,_________1940._____1939.___Shipbuildingand repairing:        200,500 153,000 42,500Marineengineering: 70,000 55,000 15,000Engineering and metal goods. 485,500 385,000 - 405,000    30-100,000(estimated prcporticnattributable t&quot; shipbuilding)If at the time the foregcing calculati:n was made, theGovernments merchant shipbuilding programme had been one ofone and a half million gr;ss tons instead cf one million gross tons, the deficiency sb&apos;wn ab:-ve would have been almost tv/ice as great as the figures shown.      The figuresused in the foregcing calculation relate however to Septemberof last year,  and since then there has been some increase inthe numbers available.      The actual numbers which would haveto be found to support a shipbuilding programme of one and a half million gross tons would therefore net be so large asthe foregoing figures suggest.     Thus, to take shipbuilding and repairing e1  ne, there has been an increase during thelast four mon+hs of some 10,000 in the number of workersavailable.      It c,;!--^ &quot;^ noted also that the total requiredin this industry, i.e., Ci0 ,000 workers, is not more than

the numbers which were actually available in the year19250      In generals it should be noted that though theincrease in the numbers required in shipbuilding and repairing is considerable3 the percentage increase isonly one-fifth of that required this year by theGovernments war programme in the industries classified as aircraft and motor vehicles-19, It is obvious that very special efforts v/illr-.eed to be made if we are to make g^od the large deficiency of labour which must be f ouncL, if we are to carry throughthe programme of one million and a half tens of merchantship building in so short a period as that of twelvemonths.      I agree with the Minister of Labour that as a first step the facts should be put fairly and squarelybeth before the ov/ners and the trade unions concerned and that both sides should be invited to collaborate withthe Government to secure the labour required.,      bearing that mind all the time both the urgency of the problem andthe need for getting the new programme under way at theearliest possible moment., I am convinced that a vigorousand sustained effort will need to be made both by theMinistry of Shipping and by the Ministry cf Labour.,The fullest possible use should be made of the expertknowledge and experience of the Ministry of Labour inthis matter.      In addition the Ministry of shipping should itself have a certain responsibility in regard toshipyard labour questions.      By this I mean that it wouldbe of advantage if the Ministry were to have its own production Officers with functions analogous to thoseassigned to the corresponding officers recentlyappointed in the field of munitions supply.

IV.      THE ORGANISATION REQUIRED.20. The difficulties with v/hich v/e shall he faced in securing a substantial increase in the annual output ofmerchant shipping ares in general, similar to those v/hichconfronted the Government in the year 1910 during the last war.    On that occasion merchant shipbuilding had dv/indled tosuch small proportions  chat for a time at least it was foundnecessary to combine in the person of the Controller of theNavy responsibility for merchant shipbuilding as v/ell as for naval construction.    This arrangement had the advantage that responsibility for all hinds cf shipbuilding was vested in theDepartment which had the longest and most intimate experienceof shipbuilding and with the complex problems associated with it.    It was also felt that this unification of responsibilityaby eliminating the possibility of interdepartmental competition,would ensure that the available resources of material andlabour were employed to the best advantage in the national interest.    I do not feel at any rate for the present thatthere is need for us to revert to the system described above,but I am convinced that the organisation at the Ministry ofShipping will need to be greatly strengthened..V. SUMMARY OP PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS ANDRECOMMENDATIONS.21. I summarise my principal conclusions and recom-mendations as followss-(i)    The programme to be aimed at;(a) the present target programme which wasadopted by the Government before theoutbreak of war aims at an annual outputof one million gross tons of merchantshippingi    at the present time output ofall types including tankers is at the rateof approximately 800,000 tons per annum,and it is not anticipated that theproduction will reach the million tons leveluntil some date in the Spring of this year;(b) having regard to the exceptional and un-expected difficulties with which we are faced in maintaining our import programmes,the present target programme is in myopinion inadequate?

(c) I recommend that the Government should atonce take a decision that all possible steps should be taken to ensure that at the expiry of a period of twelve months from now,merchant shipbuilding should reach the rateof 15500;000 gross tons per annum.    this figure represents almost a hundred per cent increase on the present rate of construction?it is equivalent also to the amount of tonnagerequired on the basis of our experience inthe first four months of the war to make good the gross losses sustained by enemy action.(ii) The difficulties to be overcome %(d) to increase by almost twofold our programmeof merchant shipbuilding w1thin as short aperiod as twelve months9 will raise difficult problems in regard both to the supply of steelrequired and in regard to labour ?    certain difficulties will also arise in regard to theprovision of the necessary amount of ship-building capacity9 but these latter difficulties are not likely to be of so serious a character 1(e) at the present time the shipbuilding capacity is divided under a pre-war plan approximatelyequally for the building of (i) naval vessels and (ii) merchant shippings capacity equivalentto about 190009000 gross tons being allottedfor each purpose.    The total shipbuilding capacity of this country is approximately295009000 gross tons but not all of the yardsare at present in use.    If therefore merchantship building is to be increased at the rate ofone and a half million gross tons per annum, itwill mean that full use will have to be madeof every available merchant yard.    It may wellmean also that it will be found necessary to reopen some of the redundant yards which sincethe last war the shipping industry have acquired for the express purpose of ensuring that they should never be reopened?(f) the amount of steel required for the presenttarget programme of one million gross tons(including certain provision for repair work)is 7509000 tons per annum,    For an actualoutput of 195009000 gross tons of merchantship building,, the steel required would be191009000 tons.    Even under the presentprogramme9 building of merchant ships isbeing held up through delays and irregularitiesin deliveries of steel to the shipyards?

if the programme of increasing one rate.ofproduction to ls500s000 tons per annum is tohave any chance of success, it is essential thatthe Government should be in a position to offer to the shipowners and to the trade unions themost categorical assurances that the steelrequired will be forthcoming,    I consider itessentials therfore, that the Goveriiment should now lay down - as the Coalition Government didduring the last war - that the steel requiredfor merchant shipbuilding is xo receive thesame degree of priority as steel required forthe Admiralty, i.e. first priority,    further the Steel Controller should be instructedthrough the Minister of Supply to allocate to merchant shipbuilding 1,100;000 tons of steel in the course of the next twelve months, the types of steel, the amounts to be deliveredperiodically and the places at which deliveryis to be made, to be determined in advance inagreement with the Ministry of Shipping.    Thesame principles should be applied in allottingpriority for materials in the engineering tradesrequired for the manufacture of machinery andother equipment for merchant vessels.even under the existing target merchant ship-building programme of 1,000,000 gross tons,there will be a labour shortage which in July-September of this year will,  as shown in the annex to the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sMemorandum (Paper w&quot;.P.(G. )  (40) 9), amount to42,500 in the shipbuilding and repairing,15,000 in marine engineering and between809000 and 100,000 in general engineering.If the merchant shipbuilding programme is nowto be expanded to one and a half million grosstons per annum, the above deficiency will be almost doubled?    The foregoing figures are based upon the numbers available in Septemberof last year,  and in view of the fact that since that date there has been some increasein the numbers available, the actual deficiencywould not be so large as the foregoing figuressuggestc    In general, it should be noted that though the increase in the numbers required in shipbuilding and repairing is considerable,  thepercentage increase is small compared with thatin other parts of the Government&apos;s war programme for example it is only one-fifth of that required this year in the industries classi-fied as aircraft and motor vehi -jleso

(i)very special efforts will need to be made if we are to make good the large deficiency of labour which must be found if we are tocarry through the programme of one and a half million tons of merchant shipbuilding in soshort a period as twelve months-,    ^s a first step the facts should be put fairly andsquarely before the owners sr.! the trade unions concerned and both sides should bo invited to collaborate with the Government to secure thelabour required.    Throughout the whole periodof the programme, the fullest use should be madeof the expert knowledge anc experience of theMinistry of Labourc    In addition the Ministry ofShipping should   itself have responsibility in regard bo shipyard iaoour questions.By this I mean that it would be of advantage ifthe Ministry were to have its own rroductionOfficers with functions analogous to thoseassigned to the corresponding officers recentlyappointed in the field of munitions supply.ertaxn responsi-(iii) The organisation required%(j)    I am satisfied that a programme for raising therate of merchant shipbuilding to one and a half million gross tons per annum can beachieved;   but this can only be secured at thecost of a great and concerted effort on the partof the Ministry of Shipping, combined with mostwholehearted and active co-operation of allother Government Departments concerned.    I donot feel, at any rate for the present, that thereis need for us to revert to the system adopted for a time during the last war by which responsi-bility for merchant shipbuilding as well as for naval construction was combined in the person of the Controller of the Navy, but I am convinced that the organisation at the Ministryof Shipping will need to be greatly strengthened.(k)   Finally, I think it essential that, if theCabinet decides in favour of these proposals,the whole position should be clearly andauthoritatively explained to the shipowners andthe representatives of labour.    Only by co-operation between the Government and them willthis programme be successihiliy achieved.SoHceasury Chambers, S.W.1.16th January, 1940.
