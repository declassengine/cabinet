(    Tl    )SUMMARY OF CONTENTS.M. Staijx&apos;s speech of the 10th March, 1939, in which he statedthat the Soviet Union stood &quot; for the support of nations which werethe victims of aggression and were fighting for the independence of their country&quot; (document 1), encouraged His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to hope that the Soviet were prepared to co-operate in an effort to restrain further aggression in Europe.On the 17th March, two days after the German occupation ofPrague, His Majesty&apos;s Government consulted the Soviet government about current reports that German aggression against Roumania was imminent. His Majesty&apos;s Government enquired whether the SovietGovernment would actively assist the Roumanian Government ifrequested by the latter to do so (document 2). In reply, the SovietGovernment proposed an immediate six-Power conference atBucharest, to be attended by representatives of the British, Soviet,French, Polish, Turkish and Roumanian Governments. M. Litvinovinformed Sir W. Seeds that the Soviet Government had refused&quot;to recognise the seizure of Czecho-Slovalua on the ground thatno Head of State had a legal or constitutional right to sign awayhis country&apos;s independence &quot; (documents 3 and 4).In an interview with the Soviet Ambassador on the 19th MarchLord Halifax explained the practical difficulties in the way of aconference at Bucharest, and suggested that more effective and rapidresults might be obtained by a four-Power declaration associatingGreat Britain, France, Poland and the Soviet Union (document 5).On the 21st March Sir W. Seeds put forward to the SovietGovernment a proposal for a four-Power declaration between theBritish, French, Polish and Soviet Governments for mutual consulta-tion in the event of a threat to the independence of any EuropeanState (documents G and 7). Although the Soviet Government weredisappointed that their proposal for a conference in Bucharest hadnot been accepted (documents 7 and 8), they agreed on the22nd March to associate themselves with a four-Power declarationI documents 9 and 10).During the visit of the Secretary of the Department of OverseasTrade to Moscow towards the end of March, Mr. Hudson had twoconversations with M. Litvinov, in which the latter enlarged uponthe theme of the failure of the democracies to withstand german aggression and the probability that &quot; a Europe entirely German would shortly be bounded simply by Great Britain and the Soviet Union &quot;(document 16). M. Litvinov had also complained of the &quot; cold-shouldering of the Soviet Union,&quot; but the Prime Minister gaveassurances in the House of Commons on the 31st March and on the3rd April that ideological differences would not be allowed to preventAnglo-Soviet collaboration in resistance to aggression (documents 13and 17).On the 28th March the Prime Minister informed the House ofCommons that His Majesty&apos;s Government were &quot; actively continuing
their consultations with other Governments,&quot; and that what theyhad in mind went &quot;a great deal further than consultation.&quot; he added that &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government had made perfectly clear to the other Governments with whom they were in consultation what his Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to do in certain circum-stances&quot; (document 11). On the &apos;29th March M. Maisky asked sir A. Cadogan to explain the exact meaning of the Prime ministers statement. Sir A. Cadogan explained that the Polish Governmentwere reluctant to associate themselves with action clearly directed to meet possible German aggression and therefore likely, in their view, to precipitate it. It was therefore useless to pursue the ideaof a four-Power declaration, and His Majesty&apos;s Government were contemplating instead the possibility of giving assurances tothe Polish and Roumanian Governments involving military assistance.   M. Maisky remarked that such a course &quot;would bea revolutionary change in British policy.....It would increaseenormously the confidence of other countries and might have a verygreat effect&quot; (documents 10 and 12).   His Majesty&apos;s Government,with the object of steadying the European situation, gave a unilateralpledge to Poland on the 81st March.    The French Governmentauthorised the Prime Minister &quot;to make it plain that they stood in the same position in this matter as His Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;(document 18).   This was afterwards converted, on the 6th April,into a reciprocal Anglo-Polish declaration.&quot;   The Soviet Governmentwere kept fully informed, and the Prime Ministers statement of the81st March (document 13) was communicated to M. Maisky earlier in the day.   Although he was unable to express his governments views at short notice, he informed Lord Halifax that the Sovietposition &quot;had been defined by M. Stalin a short time ago as assis-tance against aggression for those who fought for their independence,and therefore they were certainly prepared to help Poland or anyother country that was attacked and resisted, but the Soviet Govern -ment had no desire to force themselves on anybody.   Although they thought it groundless, they understood the fear of the Poles, whichwas that, if Soviet troops came into Poland, Polish conditions were such that the contacts that would be made would probably producedisturbing effects on Polish society.&quot;   In view of this the PrimeMinister had stated in the House of Commons on the 81st March that&quot;he had no doubt that the principles on which we are acting are fully understood and appreciated by the Soviet Government&quot; (docu-ments 13 and 14).   On the 1st April, however, M. Litvinov contestedthe latter statement and attempted to maintain that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had neither consulted nor informed the Soviet government-ment of their action.   He even expressed &quot; doubts whether we would regard an attack on Danzig or the Corridor as threatening Poland&apos;?independence&quot; (document 15).   On the 4th April a telegram was sent to Sir W. Seeds recapitulating the close consultation which had,* Cmd. 6106, No. 18.
iii fact, taken place between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theSoviet Government during the last half of March, and the encouiage-ment which the latter had given to His Majesty&apos;s Government to expect that their declaration of assistance to Poland was in accor-danco with the Soviet Government&apos;s policy (document 18).On  the  18th  April His Majesty&apos;s Government also gave a unilateral undertaking to assist Boumania and Greece (document 19).The French Government gave a similar undertaking and confirmed the Franco-Polish alliance in a declaration published on the .18th April(document W):   On the 18th April Sir John Simon referred in astatement in the House of Commons to the exchanges which hadtaken place with the Soviet Government (document 21).   The SovietGovernment were informed of the British undertakings to poland and Eoumania and invited on the loth April, in view of M. Stalin&apos;sstatement of the 10th March, to support them by a declaration thatthe assistance of the Soviet Union would be available, if desired,for any European neighbour of the Soviet Union which found itself the victim of aggression and resisted it (documents 22 and 24).On the 14th April M. Maisky informed Lord Halifax that, in viewof the action taken by TTis Majesty&apos;s Government, the Soviet Govern-ment were prepared to take part in giving assistance to Roumania.and enquired as to the best methods by which assistance could begiven.   M. Maisky felt that the guarantee of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to Boumania was right and that the British pledge given tothe Roumanian Government would steady the situation (document 23).On the 16th April M. Litvinov said that, before replying to the British proposal for a Soviet unilateral declaration, he wished to know howfar Great Britain and other countries were prepared to go when it came to the point, and what was expected of the Soviet Union(document 25).On the 18th April M. Litvinov communicated to the British andFrench Governments a proposal in writing for an Anglo-Franco-Sovietagreement for mutual assistance, implying military assistance against aggression. The three parties were also to assist all the eastern european States bordering on the U.S.S.E. against aggression, andto conclude a military pact as soon as possible (document 26). Onthe 29th April Lord Halifax explained to M. Maisky that we werein consultation with the French Government about the soviet proposal, and asked him to make clear to his Government that wehad not asked the Soviet Government to take action except in circumstances in which the British and French Governments wouldalready ba automatically involved (document 27). On the 29th AprilKir W. Seeds was instructed to remove any misunderstandingregarding the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government (document 28).Whilst the final reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Sovietproposals was still under consideration. Mi Litvinov was on the4th May relieved of his post as Commissar for Foreign affairs and was succeeded by M. Molotov (document 29). On the 6th may the Soviet Ambassador assured Lord Halifax that M. Litvinov&apos;s
departure would not imply any change of policy, and that the Russianproposals (document -26) still held the field (document 30). A similar statement was made to Sir W. Seeds by M. Molotov on the 8th May(document 32).On the 8th May the British and French representatives Communication-rated the reply of their Governments to M. Molotov. they pointed out the difficulties of guaranteeing Soviet assistance to Statessuch as Poland and Boumania, which were chary of invoking Sovietsuppbrt, and reverted to the original British proposal for a unilateralSoviet declaration consonant with the position of the Soviet Union asa Great Power, which would only commit the Soviet Government loaction after Great Britain and France had already been involved in virtue of their existing obligations (document 31). M. Molotovsuggested that the Polish Government might no longer be reluctant to accept Soviet assistance. Tie cross-examined Sir W. Seedsregarding the British attitude towards Holland, Belgium and switzerland, and expressed himself in favour of early military conversations. Although repeating that Soviet policy had not changed, he said that it was liable to be altered if other Stateschanged theirs (document 32). Further enquiries regarding theBritish proposal were made by M. Maisky on the 9th May(document 33).On the 10th May the Prime Minister made a statement in theMouse of Commons regarding the progress of the Anglo-soviet negotiations (document 34).On the 11th May M. Maislcy expressed to Lord Halifax some doubts regarding the position of the Baltic States under the british proposals, and suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government were notprepared for complete reciprocity in this respect. Lord Halifaxexpressed the hope that it might he possible to clear up any difficultiespersonally with the Soviet representative at the forthcoming council meeting at Geneva (document 35).On the 14th May M. Molotov rejected the British proposal on themounds (1) that it did not involve true reciprocity; (2) that it left the north-west frontier of the Soviet Union uncovered: and (3) thatit did not provide the Soviet Government with any guarantee againstdirect aggression. He insisted upon a concrete tripartite pact andmilitary conversations (document 36).On the 19th May the Prime Minister made a statement in theHouse of Commons in which he pointed out that the British Govern-menfc had &quot;never desired to ask the Soviet Government to do anything which they were not prepared to do themselves.&quot; SinceMis Majesty&apos;s Government had already undertaken commitments tocertain States, any inequality was in favour of the Soviet Union andnot of the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister regretted thedecision of the Soviet Government not to be represented byM. Molotov or M. Potemkin at Geneva, although the Council meeting had been postponed for a week to permit this ^document 37).[20469] b
( * )On the 21st May Lord Halifax discussed the position withM. Maisky, who was representing the Soviet Government at theCouncil meeting at Geneva. The latter insisted on the necessity ofa triple reciprocal mutual guarantee against direct aggression, but*&apos; he agreed that assistance could not be forced on those who did not desire it.&quot; He said that &quot;the essential thing was to prevent war,&quot;and that &quot;the Soviet Government were anxious that there should beno outbreak of war anywhere.&quot; Lord Halifax expressed hisdisappointment that, whereas &quot;we had made very great efforts tomeet their (the Soviet Government^) point of view, they had not changed their position at all. and had made little or no advance tomeet us&quot; (document 88).On the 21th May the Prime Minister made a further statement in the House of Commons to the effect that Lord Halifax had hadsatisfactory conversations with the French Government in Paris andwith M. Maisky at Geneva, and that he hoped that &quot; as a result of proposals which His Majesty&apos;s Government were now in a positionto make on the main questions arising, it would be found possibleto reach full agreement at an early date (document 39).&quot;On the 27th May the British and French Ambassadors in Moscowsaw M. Molotov, and put forward a revised text for a tripartite agreement for mutual assistance in certain eventualities. This textdifferentiated between States such as Poland, liouuiania and Belgium,which had accepted guarantees, and others, such as Finland and theBaltic- States, which were known to be unwilling to accept them. Iialso provided for action in conformity with the principles of theCovenant. M. Molotov appeared entirely to misunderstand thepurport of these revised proposals, and even suggested that &quot;GreatBritain and France were apparently satisfied with a state of affairswhere Bussia would be bombed by the aggressor while Bolivia blockedall action at Geneva.&quot;&apos; His attitude was such that Sir William Seedscould not omit mention of the fact that M. Molotov might &quot;merelybe manoeuvring to close the negotiations,&quot; although he assumed thaithis was not the case (documents 40-44).On the 29th May Sir W. Seeds attempted to remove M. Molotov&apos;smisapprehensions, particularly as regards action in accordance withLeague principles and the need for meeting the susceptibilities ofother Powers. M. Molotov was insistent on the necessity for military conversations, and discussed the precedent of the German entry intoPrague in March. Sir W. Seeds explained that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could not impose guarantees of protection on indepen-dent nations against their will (documents 45 and 46).On the 31st May M. Molotov made a speech to the supreme council of the U.S.S.B., in which he stated the Soviet objections tothe latest British proposals. He referred to what he termed theabsence of reciprocity and of a guarantee in the case of aggression against the States to the north-west of the U.S.S.R. He alsoobjected to the dependence of the proposed negotiations on theCovenant of the League.   He required as a minimum (1) an effective
tripartite pact of mutual assistance against aggression of a purelydefensive nature; (2) a tripartite guarantee against aggression to theStates of Central and Eastern Europe, including all European Statesbordering on the U.S.S.E.; and (8) a concrete tripartite agreement as to the forms and extent of immediate and effective assistance tobe rendered. M. Molotov repeated M. StalhVs statement of theloth March that the Soviet Union &quot; stood for the cause of peace andfor the prevention of any sort of development of aggression.....The Soviet Union could not fail to take its place in the foremost ranks of the united front of peaceful States who were really resistingaggression&quot; (document 47).On the 2nd June M. Molotov communicated to the British andFrench Ambassadors a revised text of the proposed agreement, inwhich he insisted upon (1) the naming of eight States, includingFinland, Estonia and Latvia, as those which the contracting partiesagreed to defend against aggression; and (2) the simultaneous entry into force of military and political arrangements (document 48).On the 7th June the Prime Minister made a statement in theHouse of Commons referring to the points upon which agreement had been reached with the Soviet Government. He said that inorder to remove the remaining difficulties and accelerate the negotia-tions, a representative of the Foreign Office would be sent to moscow to assist His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador. The Prime Minister also statedthat the Finnish, Estonian and Latvian Governments had made itclear that, in view of their intention to maintain strict neutrality,they did not wish to receive a guarantee as a result of the present negotiations between Great Britain. France and Russia (document 49).On the 8th June Lord Halifax had a further talk with M. Maisky.who &quot; seemed to think this (i.e., the decision to send a Foreign Officerepresentative to Moscow) a very reasonable proposal and spoke interms of warm appreciation of Mr. Strang&apos;s ability, if he was therepresentative of the Foreign Office to be selected&quot; (document 50).Mr. Strang left for Moscow on the 12th June with a memorandumof instructions for Sir W. Seeds (document 51). Although far-reaching concessions were made to meet the Soviet point of view. HisMajesty&apos;s Government maintained their opposition to naming theBaltic States in the treaty, in view of the reluctance of these states to be associated with it, and suggested an alternative method ofcovering their case. In that event, however, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would, have to insist upon also dealing with the case of theNetherlands and Switzerland, which occupied a similar position inrelation to their own security to that of the Baltic States in relationto the U.S.S.R. His Majesty&apos;s Government also explained their opposition to the simultaneous entry into force of the military andpolitical agreements. M. Molotov received the two ambassadors andMr. Strang on the 15th and 16th June, but little progress was made,particular difficulty being caused by the Soviet Governmentsinsistence upon naming the various States concerned (documents 58and 54).   The difficulties of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to
the Baltic States and the reluctance of the Polish and RoumanianGovernments to receive guarantees from the Soviet Union were againexplained to M. Molotov on the 21st June, and, in an effort to secureearly progress. His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed (1) to start staff conversations immediately on the signature of the agreement, and(2) to omit the reference to the Covenant of the League in para-graph 1 (document 55 and documents 57 and 58). M. Molotovnevertheless expressed his personal view that the proposals made tohim &quot;did not represent any pi ogress &quot; (document 56). On the22nd June M. Molotov informed the two ambassadors that theSoviet Government had rejected their proposals as unacceptable(document 5!)).On the 22nd June Lord Halifax, in a telegram to Sir W. Seeds,expressed his bewilderment at the attitr.de of M. Molotov after so manyconcessions had been made to his point of view (document 60). Onthe 23rd June Sir W. Seeds telegraphed his estimate of Soviet policy,in the course of which he suggested that they &quot; had it in mind tosecure our assistance, or at the least our apparent connivance,should they ever find it expedient to intervene in the Baltic States&quot;(document 61). Lord Halifax attempted on the 23rd june to obtain some explanation of the Soviet attitude fromM. Maisky. In reply to a point-blank question by Lord Halifax,M. Maisky said that the Soviet Government certainly wanted atreaty.   Lord Halifax pointed out that they had not &quot; budged a singleinch, and that we had made all the advances and concessions.....Saying &apos;No&apos; to everything was not his idea of negotiation, and ithad a striking resemblance to Nazi methods &quot; (document 62).On the 27th June Lord Halifax put forward a further proposalfor dealing with the difficulty of the Baltic Stales and of otherEastern European Powers without arousing their opposition(document 68).On the 29th June an article appeared in Pravda signed by a prominent member of the Politburo, M. Zhdanov, suggesting thatthe British and French Governments did not want a real agreementor one acceptable to the U.S.S.B. He concluded by suggesting that&quot;the only thing they really wanted was to talk about an agreement,and, by making play with the obstinacy of the Soviet Union, toprepare their own public opinion for an eventual deal with the aggressors &quot; (document 64).On the 1st July the two ambassadors submitted to M. Molotov thenew Franco-British proposals (document 63). These included thesuggestion that if the Soviet Government still insisted on a nominalroll of the other States to which assistance might be afforded, this might be put in an unpublished annex. In this case, how-ever, provision would have to be made for the case of theNetherlands and Switzerland. M. Molotov agreed to theprinciple of the unpublished protocol, but refused to includethe   Netherlands   and   Switzerland,   on   the   grounds   (1)   that
mreeiu.di3icin:c iiiui uie politicalment should be dependent on the military agreement suggestedthat the Soviet Government hoped to force the acceptance of militaryconditions which would be against our better judgment (document 74).On the 17th July the ambassadors saw M. Molotov, put the abovepoints, and assured him that their two Governments were willing to open military conversations (document 75). On the 28rd July the ambassadors saw M. Molotov again and informed him that their governments were prepared to meet him regarding the simultaneousenhy into force of the military and political agreements. M. Molotovexpressed satisfaction, but insisted that, to save time and to deter the aggressors, military conversations should start at once without waiting for full agreement on the two out standing points of the politicalthis was an after-thought, and (2) that the Soviet Union had nodiplomatic relations with either of them. ITe also raised the questionof &quot;indirect aggression&quot; with special reference to the Statesmentioned in the list, and demanded a very liberal interpreta-tion of this phrase. He continued to insist upon the simultaneousentry into force of the military and political agreements(documents 65-69).On the 6th July the two ambassadors were authorised to agree tothe omission of the Netherlands and Switzerland, but to refuse toagree to the simultaneous entry into force of the military and politicalagreements or to the very wide definition of indirect aggressionsuggested by M. Molotov, which would appear to justify the worstsuspicions of Finland and the Baltic States regarding Soviet inter-, r, n:e in th ir internal affairs (documents 70 and 71).     On thenth July some progress was achieved with M. Molotov.   lie remained,however, adamant as regards his definition of indirect aggression andthe question of military conversations.   He suggested that the treaty should, for example, cover the case of &quot; the employment of german officers or instructors by the Estonian or Latvian army, and the consequent  transformation  of  those  armies  into  instruments  of aggression against the Soviet Union &quot; (documents 72 and 78).   Onthe 12th July Lord Halifax stated to Sir W. Seeds the objections ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to the Soviet definition of &quot;indirect aggression&quot; (document 74).     The ambassadors were authorised toagree to the inclusion of a formula regarding indirect aggression in theactual text of the treaty instead of in an unpublished protocol.II; Molotov was to be reminded that he had made no attempt to meetthin in return for the con:essions made by His Majesty&apos;s government regarding (1) the demand that the treaty should cover the case of theBaltic  States;   (2)  the  abandonment  of  the  demand  that   the\erherlands and Switzerland should he covered by the agreement:(8) the agreement to provide for the case of indirect aggression;(4) the reluctant agreement to define indirect aggression;  (5) the readiness to insert this definition in the agreement itself: and (6) theagreement to include a clause prohibiting the signature of a separate peace. It was pointed out that the Soviet insistence that the political
(   3iv   )agreement (document 76). His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed to thissuggestion on the 25th July, although they pointed out that theycontinued to attach capital importance to finding a satisfactoryformula for article 1, i.e., one which would not give the Baltic Statescause for alarm (documents 77-79).On the 81st July the Prime Minister stated in the House ofCommons that British and French military representatives would besent to Moscow as soon as possible for military conversations, andthat the political discussions should continue concurrently with these conversations (document 80). In the course of a debate later in theday the Prime Minister disposed of the accusation that there hadbeen excessive delay in the course of the negotiations with the SovietGovernment, and, when summing up the debate, the parliamentary under-Seeretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to the difficulty which had been caused by the position of the Baltic States(document 81). On the 3rd August the Secretary of State referredto the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in a speech in the House of Lords(document 82).air. Butler&apos;s reference in the House of Commons on the 31st July(document 81) to the position of the Baltic States, was misinterpretedin a Tass communique&quot; published in Moscow on the 2nd August(document 83). M. Maisky agreed with Mr. Butler on the4th August that his remarks had been misinterpreted, and that theTass communique (document S3) had been the result of a misunder-standing (document 85). M. Molotov was informed on the 2nd Augustof the composition of the British and French military missions to moscow. The remaining difficulties in the political agreement wrerealso discussed, but M. Molotov used Mr. Butler&apos;s remarks as a pretextto adopt an unhelpful and critical attitude (document 84). the substantial measure of agreement which had been reached by thethree Governments, almost entirely as a result of British and Frenchconcessions to the Soviet point of view is, however, shown indocument 86, containing the English text of the agreement as it stoodafter the last meeting with M. Molotov on the 2nd August, beforethe opening of the military conversations.The course of the military conversations from the 11th-25th August is described in document 87. The main difficulties aroseout of (1) the Soviet intimation that they desired His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the French Government to make arrangements whereby Finnish, Latvian and Estonian bases would be at thedisposal of British, French and Soviet naval forces, and (2) the Sovietdemand that the Polish and Roumanian Governments should agree in advance to allow Soviet troops to operate in their territory in theevent of German aggression, and to draw up, at an early date, the plans necessary to provide for this eventuality. It had been impossible to reach agreement on these points when an announcementappeared in the Soviet press on the 21st August regarding theconclusion of a Soviet-German economic agreement (document 88).This was followed on the 22nd August by a second Tass communique,
announcing the decision to conclude a Soviet-German non-aggression pact and TIerr von BibbentropV, impending visit to Moscow(document 89).On the 22nd August Sir W. Seeds, on instructions, expressed toM. Molotov the astonishment of His Majesty&apos;s Government that theSoviet Government should have concluded such an agreement withthe German Government at a moment when the tripartite negotia-tions had gone far towards a successful conclusion, and that theyshould have carried on the negotiations with Germany without a?ingle word to His Majesty&apos;s Government or to the French Govern-nient, with whom the Soviet Government were already in treatyrelations. Sir W. Seeds referred to this as an act of bad faith.M. Molotov attempted to excuse himself on the pica that the militarymissions had arrived at Moscow without instructions enabling themto remove Polish or Roumanian objections to the use of their territory by Soviet troops. Even at this stage M. Molotov did not, however,exclude the continuation of the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations.He said &quot; that it all depended on the German negotiations and perhapsnfter a bit, say a week, we might see &quot; (documents 90 and 91). Onthe 23rd August a non-aggression pact between Germany and theSoviet Union was signed in Moscow. In a speech in the House ofLords on the 24th August Lord Halifax publicly expressed the british governments view of the conduct of the Soviet Government, and announced that it did not affect British obligations towards poland and other countries (document 92).On the 28th September the Soviet Government reached an agree-mcnt with the German Government for the partition of Poland. the text of this agreement, together with a joint German-Soviet declara-tion and a letter from M. Molotov to Herr von Ribbentrop of thesame date, is published as document 93.On the 28th September the Soviet Union signed a pact of mutual assistance with Estonia, granting to the Soviet Union the right to station military forces in Estonia (document 94). Similar treatieswere concluded by the Soviet Union with Latvia and Lithuania.On the 80th November Finland was attacked by Soviet forces. Onthe 3rd December the Finnish Government appealed to the League,and on the 14th December the Assembly and the Council of theLeague of Nations condemned Soviet aggression against Finland.The Soviet Union was declared to be no longer a member of theLeague (document 95).

PAPERS REGARDING THE NEGOTIATIONSWITH THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT, 1939.No. 1.Extract from the Speech b)/ M. Stalin on March 10, 1939, at the18th Congress of the AU-Uniov Communist Party.The foreign policy of the Soviet Union is clear and explicit: 1. We stand for peace and the strengthening of businessrelations with all countries. That is our position; and we shalladhere to this position as Ion:; as these countries maintain likerelations with the Soviet Union, and as long as they make no attemptto trespass on the interests of our country.2. We stand for peaceful, close and friendly relations with allthe neighbouring countries which have common frontiers with theU.S.S.E. That is our position: and we shall adhere to this positionas long as these countries maintain like relations with the soviet union, and as long as they make no attempt to trespass, directly or indirectly, on the integrity and inviolability of the frontiers of theSoviet State.3. We stand for the support of nations which are the victims of aggression and are fighting for the independence of their country.-1. We are net afraid of the threats of aggressors and are readyto deal a double blow for every blow delivered by instigators of war who attempt to violate the Soviet borders.Such is the foreign policy of the Soviet Union.No. 2.Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscoic).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, March 17, 1939.His Majesty&apos;s Government are considering their position inthe event of Eoumania becoming victim of German aggression, butan essential element in their judgment would be the knowledge ofwhat would be the attitude of other Governments.2. Please enquire immediately of Soviet Government whetherthey can give any indication that they would, if requested byRoumanian Government, actively help the latter to resist german aggression.[20469]B
No. 4.Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, March 18, 1939.My immediately preceding telegram.*Jr. Litvinov has informed me that he immediately laid my earlierrequest, before his Government. Latter took the view that no goodpurpose would be served by various Governments enquiring of eachother in turn what action others would take before making up theirown minds. The Soviet Government therefore proposed that dele-gates appointed by British. Soviet. French, Polish, Turkish and roumanian Governments should meet to discuss possibilities ofcommon action. He himself thought that Bucharest would be mostsuitable venue. I promised to transmit this suggestion to HisMajesty&apos;s Government in case events should require further consul-tations.He said that the Soviet Government had replied to the GermanAmbassadors notes with a refusal to recognise seizure of Czecho-Slovakia on the ground that no head of State had legal or consti-tutional right to sign away his country&apos;s independence.Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, March 18, 1939.Your telegram of 17th March.1I have just seen M. Litvinov, who promised to give a reply later.Meanwhile, he put to me questions which he said his colleagues would certainly ask. Had I any indication of the line which HisAfajesty&apos;s Government were proposing to take themselves? Did we wish the Soviet Union to take engagement while leaving our own hands free? I said in a problem affecting this part of Europe HisMajesty&apos;s Government quite properly wanted to know the attitudeof countries principally concerned : that would be the. obvious basisof our decision later.He said at least I could tell him what was official reaction of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to seizure of Czecho-Slovakia. What replywere we making to notes which, we, like the Soviet Government, haddoubtless received from the German Government announcing thefait accompli? I said I could for the moment only point to the PrimeMinisters speech as showing our attitude. But this did not seem tosatisfy him, possibly on the same grounds that the local press pretend that the changed attitude to Germany of The Times may be only for temporary and internal consumption.* No. 2.
Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscow).Sir, Foreign Office, March 19, 1939.The Soviet Ambassador asked to see me this afternoon.M. Maisky said that he had no doubt I had received information from your Excellency as to the two conversations that you had had with M. Litvinov. M. Maisky said that he wished to develop some-what the arguments that had been in M. Litvinov&apos;s mind in regardto the method of procedure that he had suggested by way of: conference between Great Britain, France, Poland, Russia, Turkey and roumania at Bucharest. In M. Litvinov&apos;s view this would be thequickest method of attaining results and, although he was open-minded about the venue of such a conference, he thought the psychological effect of holding it at Bucharest would be valuable both at Bucharest and at Berlin.2. I told M. Maisky that we had had an opportunity of considering this proposition this morning and that we were whollyat one with M. Litvinov in feeling the desire for finding means tomake speedy progress. We certainly had no wish to waste time inprolonged and argumentative diplomatic exchanges. At the sametime, we were sensible of two difficulties in the proposal thatM. Litvinov had made. First, we could hardly in present circumstances-stances manage to send a responsible Minister to take part in theconference, and, if this were not possible, the desired advantage inthe way of quick decision would not, in fact, be obtained. Secondly,and perhaps more important, we thought that to hold such aconference as M. Litvinov suggested without a certainty that it wouldbe successful was dangerous.3. We were at present employed upon the consideration of aproposal not altogether dissimilar, but one which we thought was perhaps better calculated to yield the results we all desired. I wasnot in a jwsition at present to speak in detail of this, as we were having a further meeting this afternoon to consider it, but in essenceour notion was that it might be possible quite quickly to find means bywhich Great Britain, France, Poland, Turkey and Russia could publiclyassert their solidarity of attitude in a form that would, I thought,achieve both the principal objects that M. Litvinov, not less than we ourselves, had in view. If some such public action could speedily betaken, it would at once constitute a plain signal of danger to theGerman Government and might be expected to afford a rallying point and vitalising force for the smaller States. Provided we could get sofar, I thought that it would then become desirable that we shouldtogether consider what precise action it would be in the power of eachof us to take in particular circumstances, and with that examinationwe should also hope to associate the giving of encouragement to thesmaller States to act in concert both with one another and with ourselves. M. Maisky did not press me closely upon the details ofwhat I had said to him and seemed prepared to give general agree-
ment to the line that I had indicated. He did ask me whether weshould rule out the idea of a conference, to which I replied that Ishould certainly not rule it out, but that I thought it was desirableto make further progress, as I thought we might expect to do more rapidly by the method I had outlined, before attempting to decide whether or not the conference procedure would be appropriate at alater stage. I told him that 1 should hope to be in a position to telegraph further instructions to your Excellency this evening for communication to the Soviet Government.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.No. 6.Viscount Halifax to Sir If. Seeds (Moscow).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, March 20, 1939.Mx telegram of 17th March.*1. JRecent German absorpaon of Czecho-Slovakia shows clearly that German Government are resolved to go beyond their hithertoavowed aim cf ecn olication of German race. They have now extendedtheir conquest to another nation, and if this should prove to be partof a definite policy cf domination there is no State in Europe whichis hot direct.y or ultimately threatened.2. In the circumstances thus created it seems to His majesty&apos;s government in the United Kingdom to lie desirable to proceed withoutdelay to the organisation of mutual siqiport on the part of ail thosewho realise the necessity of protecting international society from further violation of the fundamental laws on which it rests.3. As a first step they propose that the French, Soviet and polish Governments should join with His Majesty&apos;s Government insigning and publishing a formal declaration, the terms of which they suggest should be on the lines of the following: &quot;We the undersigned, duly authorised to that effect, herebydeclare that, inasmuch as peace and security in Europe are matters of common interest and concern, and since European peace and security may be affected by any action which consti-tutes a threat to the political independence of any European State,our respective Governments hereby undertake immediately to consult together as to what steps should he taken to offer jointresistance to any such action.&quot;4. It appears to us that the publication of such a declaration would in itself be a valuable contribution to the stability of Europe,and we should propose that publication should be followed by an examination by the signatories of any specific situation which requiresit, with a view to determining the nature of any action which mightbe taken.
No. 7.Sir IV. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.Telegraphic.) Moscow, March 21, 1939.Youit telegram of 20th March.*I saw M. Litvinov this afternoon and gave him substance of paragraphs 1 and 2 of your telegram as well as text of proposed declaration.2. lie said that in view of misleading reports published in thepress of all countries (except in Soviet Union), he had been compelledto issue to-day an official communique stating that in reply to ourenquiries about his Govermnenfs attitude he had suggested a six-Power conference. He understood from the Soviet Ambassador inLondon that you considered his suggestion premature.3. I pointed out that the present proposal of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in no way rendered his suggestion premature : it onlyproposed earlier step, which would be clearer warning to potentialaggressors and was easier to decide on owing to the smaller numberof Powers concerned at the outset.1. He answered that agreement on your present proposal wouldbe more easily attained by a conference, otherwise each government concerned would suggest amendments of text and endless telegraphingwould ensue. I argued that the substance of the declaration was such that truly peace-loving Governments could not fail to subscribeio it, and that any amendments would therefore be only slight andspeedily settled..&quot;). M. Litvinov expressed the belief that the Polish Governmentwould not commit themselves to a declaration of the nature proposed.(&apos;. He reverted several times to the fact that his suggestion was regarded as &quot;premature,&quot; and I observe that that word concludesthe communique to which he alluded and which 1 have only this moment received.7. Text of communique follows in my immediately succeedingtelegram, t5. Please endeavour immediately to obtain the views of Govern-ment to which you are accredited. His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe prepared to sign declaration immediately the three other Govern-inents indicate their readiness to do so.(S. We should propose to say nothing of this to the otherGovernments concerned before the four Powers are agreed on thedeclaration.N.B. A similar telegram was addressed to Paris and Warsaw.
No. 9.Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, March 22, 1989.My telegram of 21st March.*M. Litvinov sent for me this evening and informed me asfollows : -&apos;&apos; We are in agreement with the British proposal and accepttext of declaration. The Soviet Government will give itssignatures as soon as both France and Poland have accepted theBritish proposal and promised their signatures.&quot;2. The Soviet Government suggest that the declaration shouldbe signed by the Prime Minister as well as by the Minister forForeign Affairs of each country. They are also anxious that notonly the Balkan but also Baltic and Scandinavian countries shouldbe invited to adhere after publication.Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, March 21, 1939.Following is text of Tass communique referred to in my immediately preceding telegram&apos; : &quot;Foreign press have been spreading rumours to effect that soviet Government recently proposed to Poland and Eoumaniaits aid in case they became victims of aggression. Tass is authorised to declare that this does not correspond to reality.Neither Poland nor Eoumania appealed to Soviet Government foraid or informed Soviet Government of any danger threateningthem. It is true that on 18th March British Government, havinginformed Soviet Government that there were serious reasons forfearing an act of violence against Eoumania, enquired as to possible position of Soviet Government in such an eventuality.Soviet Government in reply to this enquiry made proposal of calling Conference of representatives of most interested States,namely, Great Britain, France, Poland, Roumania, Turkey andU.S.S.R. Such a Conference in opinion of Soviet Governmentwould give best possibility for clarifying real situation andascertaining position of each of participants. British Government,however, believed that this proposal was premature.&quot;* No. 7.
Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscow).Sir, Foreign Office, March 28, 1939.The Soviet Ambassador called on the 23rd March on Sir A.Cadogan and told him, although he understood we had already received news to that effect through your Excellency, that the reply of his Government to our enquiry about the four-Power declaration was in the affirmative.2. Sir A. Cadogan said that we had already received this information from you and that we appreciated the prompt affirmativereply given by the Soviet Government. At the same time we hadbeen somewhat disconcerted at the proposal of the Soviet Governmentto make a public announcement on the subject to-day. M. Maiskyat once said that he understood that his Government had now revisedtheir decision on this point and would not be publishing.3. He then went on to question Sir A. Cadogan as to the generalprogress of our negotiation. Sir A. Cadogan told him that so farwe were without a final answer from the Polish Government. Heenquired whether the Polish Government appeared to he making any serious difficulty. Sir A. Cadogan said that it was easy tounderstand that the Polish Government at this juncture should feelthemselves to be in a difficult position : they had told us, in fact,that the matter would require very careful consideration. If wasnot unnatural that they might hesitate before committing themselvesin peace time to joining openly a bloc which was obviously designed for resistance to German expansion. Sir A. Cadogan was bound tosay in all frankness that their hesitation on this point seemed tobe increased by the reflection that, if they joined a. bloc which included the Soviet Government, that in itself would expose the mall the more to German indignation. However, Sir A. Cadoganrepeated that they appeared to be still considering the matter andwe would of course keep closely in touch with M. Maisky.4. He then enquired whether, if we secured the declaration,we should then proceed to get in touch with other Powers. In his view it would be advisable to secure the co-operation of as many countries as possible. Sir A. Cadogan said that that would no doubtcome up for consideration in the course of the exchanges of views which would follow on the declaration, but. as a personal observation,he suggested that it might perhaps he as well to start with certain countries who appeared to be more directly in the road of german advance and who were already organised in some treaty arrangements.T am. &amp;c.HALIFAN.
Statement by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons onMarch 28, 1930.Mr. Arthur Greenwood asked the Prime Minister whether he hasany statement to make with regard to the European situation?The Prime Minister: T need not repeat the statement which 1made last Thursday on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, but Ican inform the House that TI is MajestVs Government are activelycontinuing their consultations with other Governments upon the issues arising from recent events. During the progress of these consultations, the House will appreciate that it is essential that theirconfidential character should be respected, and hon. members willnot. I trust, press me to make statements which could not in anycase he complete, until we are in possession of the final views of theother Governments concerned.Mr. Greenwood: While one realises the difficulties of completedisclosure at this stage, in view of the general uneasiness which Tthink there is in this country and in the House, would it be possible,for the enlightenment of the public here and the public abroad andof certain other Powers, for the right hon. gentleman to go just alittle bit further to remove the apprehensions that there are in the minds of members in all parts of the House, as to whether thedeclaration which has been submitted to certain Powers is one merely for consultation, or whether it is one which is a policy of mutual aidwhich might involve military commitments? Tf the House could have some guidance on that matter it might feel more at rest thanit is at this time.The Prime Minister: 1 quite appreciate the right hon. gentle-man&apos;s desire to have as much information as possible, and particularly to remove what he, I think, rightly describes as misapprehensions.He will appreciate, on the other hand, that it is extremely difficult and delicate to throw all the cards on the table while the game is notyet complete. It will, at any rate, be readily understood, from what i have said previously, that what the Government have in mind goesa great deal further than consultation. I do not think I should liketo go any further into details at this moment.Mr. Dalton: May I take note of what the right hon. gentlemanhas said, that what the Government have in mind goes further thanconsultation? Have the Government made clear the contents oftheir minds to those foreign Powers with whom they have communi-cated. and particularly has it been made clear to Poland that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be willing, in conjunction with othergreat Powers, to come to Poland&apos;s assistance if she is to be the nextvictim of German aggression?
The Prime Minister: I think I must still maintain a certainreserve on this matter. I will say this, that the Government havemade perfectly clear to the other Governments with whom they arein consultation what His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to doin certain circumstances.Mr. Greenwood: May I assume that the right hon. gentlemanwill take every possible step to speed up the negotiations that aretaking place, and may I assume quite definitely that perhaps at avery early date the House will want a discussion of the position?The Prime Minister: I appreciate that, but I would like to assure the right hon. gentleman and the House generally that the Govern-reassessment  fully realise the urgency of this matter and the desirability of coming to a conclusion at the earliest possible moment. At the sametime it will be realised that there is more than one Governmentinvolved, and that the issue is not solely in the hands of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.No. 12.Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscow).Sir, Foreign Office, April 4, 1939.At the end of a conversation with Sir A. Cadogan on the29th March, the Soviet Ambassador referred to the Prime ministers statement in the House of Commons on the 28th March,* and inparticular to bis replies to supplementary questions by Mr. Greenwood,M.P., and Mr. Dalton, M.P. As regards the former, M. Maiskydrew attention to the Prime Ministers words : &quot;It will, at any rate,readily understood from what I have said previously that whatthe Government have in mind goes a great deal further thanconsultation.&quot; As regards the latter, he drew attention to the words :&quot;I will say this, that the Government have made perfectly clear tothe other Governments with whom they are in consultation what His.Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to do in certain circumstances.&quot;M. Maisky said that he was rather puzzled by these replies. In thefirst place, he was not aware that His Majesty&apos;s Government were proposing to go further than consultation, and, in the second place,his Government had not, so far as he was aware, been kept informed as to what action His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to takebeyond consultation.2. In regard to the first point, Sir A. Cadogan &apos;.cmindedM. Maisky that the proposal for consultation contemplated jonsulta-tion with a view to concerting measures, and therefore went a littlebit further than pure consultation, and M. Maisky accepted this. Inregard to the second point, he was reminded of a conversation! that sir A. Cadogan had a short while ago with him when he asked0[20469]
whether he could be told anything in regard to the result of oursoundings of other Governments on the proposed four-power declaration. As Sir A. Cadogan had then hinted to his Excellency,it appeared that the Polish Government at least would be unwilling to be associated openly with the Soviet Government in any suchdeclaration. Their attitude on this point was, as we understood it,due not to any feeling of hostility towards the Soviet Government,but to the reflection that such open association with them would, inthe circumstances, merely increase the fury and indignation of theGerman Government. Sir A. Cadogan said that we had had torecognise that it was useless to pursue the idea of the four-power declaration, and If is Majesty&apos;s Government had therefore been considering what other line they could usefully take. It seemed thatin present circumstances the countries nearest to the German menaceand most exposed to attack were Poland and Roumania, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government had come to the conclusion that it was essentialto ascertain what the spirit of resistance of those two countries wouldbe and in what way it.could best be fortified. They were thereforecontemplating the possibility of giving assurances, together with theFrench Government, to the Polish and Roumanian Governments inthe hope that that would encourage them successfully to resistfurther German expansion. If those countries were determined to resist and were ultimately engaged in a conflict with Germany, theywould no doubt be glad of the sympathy and, indeed, of the activeassistance of the Soviet Government, if the latter were disposed to accord it, in whatever way might seem most suitable and effective.3. M. Maisky asked whether what we were contemplatinginvolved direct military assistance to Poland and Roumania, to which sir A. Cadogan replied that that was what those countries wouldrequire, and that we were indeed contemplating the possibility ofgiving assurances to that effect. Sir A. Cadogan said that the matter was at the moment still under consideration, and his Excellency mustnot take it from him that a firm decision had been taken, though he personally thought that it was likely that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-liient would be ready to give such assurances.4. M. Maisky asked whether the French Government agreed tothis course, to which Sir A. Cadogan replied that we had been discussing it with them and they appeared to be sympathetic to it.M. Maisky remarked that, if we adopted this course, that would bea revolutionary change in British policy and might have most far-reaching results. It would increase enormously the confidence ofother countries and might have a very great effect.5. Sir A. Cadogan said that he knew I would wish to keep intouch with his Excellency and keep him informed of developments,and that when the final decision had been taken I would doubtles-inform him of it.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.
Statement bi/ the Prime Minister in the House of Commons onMarch 31, 1939.The Prime Minister: As the House is aware, certain consultationsare now proceeding with other Governments. In order to makeperfectly clear the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in themeantime before those consultations are concluded, I now have toinform the House that during that period, in the event of any actionwhich clearly threatened Polish independence, and which the PolishGovernment accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty&apos;s Government would feel themselveshound at once to lend the Polish Government all support in their power. They have given the Polish Government an assurance tothis effect.I may add that the French Government have authorised me tomake it plain that they stand in the same position in this matter as do His Majesty&apos;s Government.Mr. Arthur Greenwood: May I, in one sentence, transgress inorder to say that I am quite sure that this House realises the potentialities that might arise from the statement which the right on. gentleman has made. It may prove to be in its consequencesas momentous a statement as has been made in this House for a quarter of a century. It is very difficult with such recent statementsbefore us to say very much, but may I ask the right hon gentlemanone or two questions which I do not think he has made quite clear in his statement. I would like to ask him whether the statement which he has now read is to be regarded as the first step in adeveloping policy to deter or restrain aggression, and, if so, will theGovernment take immediate, active and energetic steps to bring into this arrangement other Powers? Will he especially think ofthe value of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together withother Powers, large and small? Will he do so with the wider objectof obtaining the maximum amount of co-operation in the defenceof peace? Will he consider now the advisability of an immediateconference of those Powers who might be prepared to range themselves on the side of peace as against aggression?The Prime Minister: I will try to answer the questions which theright lion, gentleman has put to me. I think the statement make sit clear that what I have said is intended to cover what I may call an interim period. The Government, as has already been announced, are in consultation with various other Powers, including,of course, the Soviet Government. My noble friend the foreign secretary saw the Soviet Ambassador this morning, and had veryfull discussions with him on the subject. I have no doubt that theprinciples upon which we are acting are fully understood and appre-ciated by that  Government.    The  House is aware  that we are
expecting a visit next week from Colonel Beck, the Foreign Secretaryof Poland. There will then be an opportunity of discussing withhim the various further measures that may be taken in order, asthe right hon. gentleman lias put it, to accumulate the maximum amount of co-operation in any efforts that may be made to put anend to aggression, if aggression were intended, and to substitute for it the more reasonable and orderly method of discussion.Mr. Greenwood: There is a point to which the right hon.gentleman did not refer the possibilities of a conference. May put this point, and I want to put it quite frankly, as 1 think theHouse will not be without a feeling of responsibility at this moment.Can the right hon. gentleman say whether in his view he would welcome that maximum co-operation from all Powers, including theU.S.S.B.?The Prime Minister: Yes. we should welcome the maximum amount of co-operation. On the question of a conference, in our view it is simply a matter of practical expediency. We have no theoreticalviews about a conference. If it proved to he the best way we shouldnot hesitate to use it. If we find that there is a more effective wayof achieving our object, we might dispense with&apos; a conference.Mr. John Morgan: Can the right hon. gentleman give us an assurance that there are no ideological impediments between us andthe U.S.S.B.?77*c Prime Minister: Yes, I have no hesitation in giving thatassurance.No. 14.Viscount Halifax lo Sir W. Seeds (Moscow).Sir, Foreign Office. March 81, 1939.I asked the Soviet Ambassador to come and see me this morning,and began by apologising for having been obliged, through no faultof my own, to postpone the appointment I had made with himyesterday.2. I knew, however, that he had seen Sir Alexander Cadogautwo days v.go,* who had k;pt him informed of the lines on which wewere proceeding and which had been rendered necessary-y by theparticular position of the Polish Government, of which he was, ofcourse, very well aware. I then told the Ambassador that it had appeared to us of considerable importance to secure the position,pending the conclusion of the consultations in which we were engaged.There had been many rumours in circulation about Germany&apos;intentions against Poland, of which, as the Prime Minister had already stated in the House of Commons, we had no official confirmation.None the less, we thought that it would be valuable at the present justice that there should be no doubt as to the position of this
country. Accordingly, I told him that the Prime Minister was makinga statement in the House of Commons this afternoon promisingsupport to the Polish Government in certain circumstances shouldthe need for this arise. I then read M. Maisky the statement that thePrime Minister proposed to make.3. His first comment was that the phrase &quot;&quot;lend the PolishGovernment all support in their power&quot; might be argued to be aphrase capable of being greatly minimised by those who, whetherhonestly or from a desire to make mischief, would profess doubts asto the genuine character of British intentions.4. I said that, of course, nothing could prevent people who wishedio make mischief from making it, but that the Polish Governmenthad appeared to welcome our suggestion and that the decision onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government was, from the point of view ofBritish policy, a grave and momentous decision. M. Maisky agreed and I pointed out to him that this was only an interim arrangementpending the conclusion of the wider discussion.5. Having regard to the importance of avoiding any unnecessaryappearance of divisions between the Governments concerned, I asked the Ambassador whether there was anything that the Prime minister could say on the lines of assuming that the Soviet Government wouldnot disapprove or even would approve the general line we were taking. I was not surprised that M. Maisky took the opportunityof saying that, as he had not been consulted yesterday, it was obviously impossible for him to say at a momenfs notice what theposition of his Government would be. It had been defined byM. Stalin a short time ago as assistance against aggression for thosewho fought for their independence, and therefore they were certainlyprepared to help Poland or any other country that was attacked andresisted, but the Soviet Government had no desire to force themselves on anybody. Although they thought it groundless, they understood the fear of the Poles, which was that, if Pviissian troops came intoPoland, Polish conditions were such that the contacts that would bemade would probably produce disturbing effects on Polish society.6. I suggested to M. Maisky that the Prime Minister might saywe had every reason to suppose, from the declaration of the principlesou which Bussian foreign policy rested, that they would not find themselves other than in agreement with our declaration, or some-thing to that effect. The Ambassador did not seem to feel any greatdifficulty about this being said, for what it was worth, on the PrimeMinisters own authority, and agreed with me when I said that therewere plenty of people about trying to make mischief between hisGovernment and our Government, and possibly between his Govern-ment, Plis Majesty&apos;s Government and the Polish Government. Thepurpose of all who wished to stand together, being essentially agreed,must be to avoid giving mischief-makers any encouragement. To thisvirtuous sentiment M. Maisky readily assented, and I said I lookedforward to the opportunity next week of discussing these difficultmatters with Colonel Beck and, so far as I could, without breach of
Colonel BeciVs confidence, I looked forward to a further opportunityof discussing them with M. Maisky. The Ambassador thanked me for what I had said, and repeated that his Government had no wish to force themselves on anybody, and would therefore take no initiative.7, In reply to an enquiry by the Ambassador as to what was thepresent position as to the suggested four-Power declaration, I saidthat in that form the project was evidently bound to encounterdifficulty, but that we were hopeful of being able to achievesubstantially the ends we had in view by the rather different approachwe were now making.8. As he was leaving, the Ambassador asked me whether colonel beck was proposing to visit France on his return from this country,but I told him that 1 had no further information on this matter than had appeared in the press.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.No. 15.Sir IV. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscoiv, April 1,1939.Moscow pre 6 published full leports yesterday of proceedings in theMouse of Commons, but omitted any mention of Prime Minister^expressed belief that Soviet Government understood and appreciatedprinciples on which His Majesty&apos;s Government were acting.2. I have just seen M. Litvinov, who made it quite clear that HisMajesfy&apos;s Governmenfs action is misunderstood and not at all appre-ciated. He claimed at first that we had never informed the SovietGovernment that proposed four-Power declaration had been dropped.I contested this and an examination of Soviet Ambassadors telegrams from London eventually absolved us of that charge. Nevertheless, hesaid fact remained that in response to our approach Soviet Governmenthad first suggested six-Power conference, and, secondly, agreed to signa four-Power declaration; each proposal had been summarily dropped.Now His Majesty&apos;s Government, of their own initiative, were engaged on a new plan of which he knew little. Soviet Government had hadenough and would henceforward stand apart free of any commitments.8. I denied that His Majesty&apos;s Government were in any wayresponsible for failure of the two proposals in question, which, as hewell knew, failed only because of certain international suspicions which seemed to clog every means of approach. Surely in Soviet Union,where we were always attacked for alleged capitulations, a welcomeshould be accorded to a momentous change of front. soviet ambassador had been, and would be, kept informed in accordance withour des&quot;re to maintain clo?e touch with Soviet Government.4. But he was not to he moved, and in spite of my argument thatPrime Ministers statement covered only an interim arrangement and
No. 16.Sir 11&apos;. Seech to Viscount Halifax.My Lord. Moscow, April 3, 1039.1 have the honour to report thai the visit to Moscow ofMr. Hudson and his mission gave frequent occasion for an informalinterchange of views on the general international situation. Moreformal conversations were limited to two in number.2. The first, on the 23rd March, was in fact on M. Litvinov&apos;sinitiative, as he took opportunity of Mr. Hudson&apos;s first courtesy callin my company to express his views at considerable length. these were on the lines used by him in previous conversations with myself,and could be divided into (1) a recital of the past errors of the&quot; capitulating &quot; Western democracies, and of the efforts of the SovietGovernment to guide Europe in the right path, and (2) a recoin-luendation of a conference of Powers, great and small, to remedy the evils and dangers of the present situation.3. M. Litvinov&apos;s historical review was most comprehensive, andbegan as far back as the adhesion of the Soviet Union to the Leagueof Nations. Developed with his usual mastery of the subject, itexhibited the constant retreat of the Western democracies from oneposition after another, culminating in the Munich capitulation andthe cold-shouldering of the Soviet Union.I. M. Litvinov was quite clear on those points. Touching butlightly, as he generally does in conversation with mo. on British weak-ness (in contradistinction to his habit when conversing with a french representative), he said that France was practically done for: shewas. as he put it, full of German agents, disaffected and disunited,at the mercy of certain leading politicians whom he profoundlydistrusted. He foresaw, in the not far-distant future, a Europeentirely German from the Bay of Biscay to the Soviet frontier, andbounded, as it were, simply by Great Britain and the Soviet Union.Even that would not satisfy German ambitions, but the attack, hesaid smiling happily, would not be directed to the East.5. Mr. Hudson countered with a description, most valuable, asfuming from one in the know, of the change of heart which had occurred both in the Government and people of Great Britain, andalso of the remarkable progress of our rearmament which hadcompletely reversed the previous situation. Having, as I think,considerably impressed his hearer, he mentioned your Lordship&apos;smust not, therefore be picked to pieces, he expressed doubts whether wewould regard attack on Danzig or Corridor as threatening Poland&apos;independence. In any case we could pursue our own policy; the SovietGovernment would stand aside a course which might possibly be ini heir best interests.
anxiety that Powers interested in the preservation of peace should maintain close contact and should act in concert so far as possible.6. This led to a discussion as to which particular Powers shouldbe included in any such concert or contact, M. Litvinov maintaining the necessity of including the largest possible number, both smalland great, while Mr. Hudson argued that it was for the big Powers,especially Great Britain and the Soviet Union, to give a lead whichthe others would probably follow. Both agreed that in any case thefullest measure of resistance, whether diplomatic or military or economic, should come into review at any such conference.7. A further conversation between M. Litvinov, Mr. Hudsonand myself was arranged, at which I asked his Excellency to define more particularly what he had in mind. It then became clearthat M. Litvinov had only been envisaging a conference with theSouth-Eastern and Baltic and Scandinavian countries to follow theFour-Power declaration, which was then the subject of negotiation,as a later development of his suggestion which I had forwarded to your Lordship by my telegram of the 22nd March.*I have, &amp;c.WILLIAM SEEDS.* No. 9.No. 17.Extinct from the Prime Minister&apos;s Speech in the House of commons on April 8, 1939.I no not wish to-day to attempt to specify what Governments wemay now, or in the near future, find it desirable to consult with onthe situation, but 1 would make one allusion to the Soviet Union,because T quite appreciate that the Soviet Union is always in thethoughts of hon. members opposite, and that they are still a littlesuspicious as to whether those so-called ideological differences maynot be dividing us upon what otherwise it would obviously be in theinterests of both to do. I do not pretend for one moment thatideological differences do not exist; they remain unchanged. But.as I said on Friday in answer to a question, our point is that what-ever may be those ideological differences they do not really count ina question of this kind. What we are concerned with is to preserveour independence, and when I say &quot; our independence &quot; I do not mean only this country&apos;s. I mean the independence of all states which may be threatened by aggression in pursuit of such a policy as I have described.Therefore, we welcome the co-operation of any country, whatever may be its internal system of government, not in aggression, but inresistance to aggression.
Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscow).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, April 4, 1989.Your telegram of 1st April.*T approve your language. I cannot find any justification forM. Litvinov&apos;s attitude. Soviet Ambassador here has been kept informed at every stage.2. On 19th Marcht I explained to him the difficulties we saw inM. Litvinov&apos;s proposal for a conference at Bucharest, and said that,while we did not rule it out, we had a proposal of our own, not altogether dissimilar, which we thought was better calculated to achieve the results we wanted.8. That proposal (the four-Power declaration) was put to theSoviet Government by your Excellency on 21st March.* On thefollowing day Soviet Government informed you that they acceptedtext of declaration, and would sign &quot;as soon as both France and poland have accepted and promised their signatures.&quot;4. On 28rd March $ we expressed to Soviet Ambassador our appreciation of this reply, but intimated that, while we had as yet no final answer from the Polish Government, we understood that latter would hesitate before committing themselves.5. On 29th March I! Soviet Ambassador was told that, in view ofthe Polish attitude, we had to recognise that it was useless to pursue the idea of a four-Power declaration, and that we had therefore been considering what other line we could usefully take. lie was told thatthe reason for this change of plan was that it now appeared that thePolish Government would be unwilling to be associated openly withthe Soviet Government in any such declaration. Their attitude onthis point, as understood here, was due not to any feeling of hostility to the Soviet Government, but to the reflection that such openassociation with them would merely increase indignation of GermanGovernment. When I spoke to the Soviet Ambassador on81st March&quot;; be said that the Soviet Government, although they thought it groundless, understood the fear of the Poles, which wasthat, if Soviet troops came into Poland, Polish conditions were such that the contacts that would be made would probably producedisturbing effects on Polish society.(i. The Soviet Ambassador was on 29th Marchll given a provisional outline of the new course we were contemplating, whichwould involve our giving assurances, together with France, to poland and Roumania.

Soviet Government, since the Soviet Ambassador was told that ifPoland and Eoumania were engaged in conflict with Germany theywould no doubt be glad of the active assistance of the Soviet Govern-ment, if the latter were disposed to accord it, in whatever way was most suitable and effective.7. Before any further statement on this new proposal could bemade to the Soviet Ambassador circumstances arose which made itnecessary for the Prime Minister to make a declaration in the Houseof Commons on afternoon of 31st March. Soviet Ambassador was informed of purport of that statement on the morning of 81st March,before it was made.118. If M. Litvinov complains that it is not true to say, as thePrime Minister did, that he had &quot;no doubt that the principles onwhich we are acting are fully understood and appreciated by theSoviet Government,&quot; the answer is that the Soviet Ambassador told me on 81st March that Soviet policy had recently been defined byM. Stalin as assistance against aggression for those who fought fortheir independence, and therefore they were certainly prepared to helpPoland and any other country that was attacked and resisted. Theprinciples by which His Majesty&apos;s Government were moved -to make their Polish declaration were precisely the same; and it seemedtherefore self-evident that these principles would be both understoodand appreciated by Soviet Government.U No. 14.No. 19.Extract from Statement by the Prime Minister in theHouse of Commons on April 18, 1939.I take this opportunity of saying, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, that they attach the greatest importance to the avoidance of disturbance by force or threats of force of the status quo in theMediterranean and the Balkan Peninsula. Consequently, they have come to the conclusion that, in the event of any action being taken which clearly threatened the independence of Greece or Eoumania.and which the Greek or Roumanian Governments respectivelyconsidered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Greekor Roumanian Government, as the case might be, all the support intheir power. We are communicating this declaration to the Govern-ments directly concerned, and to others, especially Turkey, whoseclose relations with the Greek Government are known.   I understand
that the French Government are making a similar declaration this afternoon. I need not add that the Dominion Governments, asalways, are being continuously informed of all developments.No. 20.Sir E. Phipps to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Paris, April 18, 1939.Following is translation of French Government&apos;s declarationissued this afternoon : &quot;The French Government has to-day published the decisions taken yesterday by the Council of Ministers.&quot; In communicating them to the press M. Daladier, Presidentof the Council, Minister for National Defence and War, aeeom-panied them by the following declaration : &quot; &apos; I defined the policy of France in the speech which Idelivered by radio on the 29th March. I then said that europe was in a state of watchfulness and that France, decided to main-tain peace in freedom and honour, should first strengthen her own defences and increase her bonds of solidarity with all peopleswho were resolved to stand up to aggression. Since then it is inthis sense that we have acted. We did so without verbal manifes-tations and without vain provocations. Action, in order to be effective, has no need to be accompanied either by speeches orby threats.&quot;&apos; That is why we have taken military measures whichguarantee the frontiers of France and her empire against anysurprise. The Government thanks, in the name of France, ailthose men who have rejoined their posts in their regiments, intheir squadrons, and in their ships, all those who contribute to assure the security of their country. It wishes to thank all thosewho, in our national defence factories, in whatever capacity, aremaking a vigorous effort, of which I register the happy resultsevery day. It renders homage to the entire people who, in Franceand in her overseas territories, give an admirable example ofcalm and resolution.&quot; &apos; At the same time, following the same methods, we havepursued the diplomatic action necessary for the maintenance ofpeace by strengthening the common bonds (&quot; solidarit6s&quot;)which must unite before the common peril all the countries whichare resolved to preserve their liberty. We remain in permanentcontact with the Governments of Great Britain, the United States,Russia, Poland and the Balkan Entente. Our aim, which I am convinced we shall attain, is to organise this necessary collabora-tion between all the nations who do not think of threatening the
vital interests of any people whatever, who do not refuse to under-take in good faith any examination of present problems, and whoare determined to oppose any attempt at domination. Need Iadd that our close and deep entente with Great Britain has never been stronger than to-day.&quot;&apos;I therefore address to the French nation the followingdeclaration which has been drafted in agreement by theGovernment of the republic and the Government of GreatBritain : &quot; &apos; The French Government attaches the greatest impor-atice to preventing any modification of the status quo in theMediterranean and in the Balkan Peninsula imposed by force or threat of force.&quot; * Taking into consideration the special anxieties to whichthe events of recent weeks have given rise, the French Govern-incnt has consequently given to Boumania and Greece theparticular assurance that, 121 the event of an action being undertaken which should clearly threaten the independence of Pioumania or Greece, and which the Roumanian government or the Greek Government should consider it in its vital interestto resist with its national forces, the French Government will consider itself bound immediately lo lend that Government allassistance in its power.&quot; &apos; The English Government has adopted the same attitude.&quot; &apos; Moreover, the French Government has been pleased by theconclusion of the reciprocal engagements of Great Britain and poland, who have decided to grant each other mutual support inorder to defend their independence if it were threatened directly or indirectly. The Franco-Polish Alliance is. moreover, confirmed by the French Government and the Polish Government in thesame spirit. France and Poland guarantee each other immediately and directly against any direct or indirect threat against theirvital interests.&quot; &apos; We are communicating this declaration to all the interested governments, and in particular to Turkey.&quot; &apos; The protection of the territory of France and her Empireagainst any direct or indirect attack on her integrity and herrights, the search, with the sole desire for peace, for all theententes appropriate for ensuring the joint protection of peoplesagainst any enterprise threatening their independence such isthe policy which the French Government has followed, in fullconsciousness of its responsibilities and with the inflexible deter-mination not to recoil before any of the duties imposed on it by theprotection of the destinies of France.&apos; &quot;
Extract from Speech by Sir J. Simon in the House of Commons onApril 13, 1939.At the very outset of this new policy we did, as I think the Houseknows, earnestly invite the speedy co-operation of Eussia. Veryshordy after the German occupation of Czecho-Slovakia, we invited the Soviet Government to join in a four-Power declaration. TheSoviet Government responded quite promptly, and said that theywould agree to join in a four-Power declaration as soon as France and poland had accepted and had promised their signatures. As the hon.gentleman said, we got to rather a delicate point, and I think theHouse knows that it. unfortunately, proved impossible to realise thatprecise project, and we were obliged to adopt a different course, notwith a different object, but a different method. Then a suggestion was made by Russia.   Tliev suggested a conference of Powers.Mr. ttalton : The right hon. gentleman is giving it in the wrongorder.   The conference came first.Sir J. Simon : I am obliged to the lion, gentleman. They were both quite early, and in neither case was our action in any sort ofway disparaging or discouraging. With regard to Russia&apos;s proposalfor a conference I think it was to be a conference at Bucharest 1 wish to say. as has been said before, that ilis Majesty&apos;s Govern-reassessment  had no sort of objection to that proposal because it came fromSoviet Russia. The proposal had to be examined, judged andlironounced upon purely as a practical issue. Everybody who hasattended a conference knows that the most important thing to secureif that one does not start the conference until one has some solidreason for thinking it will be successful. A conference that breaksdown in confusion does far more harm than discussions throughother channels. The difficulty we felt had nothing to do with thefact that the proposal was made by Soviet Russia. It was purely aquestion of what was the most effective and prompt machinery forgetting agreement between the Powers concerned. There would havebeen great difficulties in having a conference, hut we should have tried to get over them if we had been able to persuade ourselvesthat that method was the best method. We never resisted theproposal because it came from Soviet Eussia. We were never lessinclined to approve of it on that account. We regarded it and Iam sure Soviet Eussia understands this simply as a question ofprocedure and method, our object being to get as quickly as possiblethe greatest amount of agreement we could.Recent events in Europe, both in March and in April, gave riseinevitably to anxiety in certain countries that their independence wasin jeopardy, and that the matter was as urgent as a matter couldho.   ft might have been a matter of days or hours.   To meet that
danger not behind the back of Soviet Bussia, not with any disintegration-clination to make use of her help, but because we were faced withthis immediate and urgent business, and in full accord with theFrench Government we felt impelled to make what contributionwe could to the restoration of confidence by giving the assurances of which the House knows. Therefore, we took on special commit-ments to those countries whose independence was exposed, or mightbe exposed, to an immediate menace. Throughout those negotiationswe have kept Soviet Eussia in the closest touch with ourselves, andI will give the House a short account of some of the actual steps that were taken.On the 29th March the Soviet Ambassador was told that we hadto recognise that it was useless to pursue the idea of a four-power declaration, and that we, therefore, had been considering what otherline we could usefully take. The Soviet Ambassador was given a provisional outline of the new course we were contemplating, whichwould involve us giving assurances, together with France, to poland and Eoumania. The Soviet Ambassador recognised that this wouldbe a revolutionary change in British policy and that it would increaseenormously the confidence of other countries. It was made clear in the conversations that we had no intention at all of excludinghelp from the Soviet Government, if the latter were disposed to afford it, in whatever way was most suitable and effective.Circumstances then arose, however, which made it necessary forthe Prime Minister to make the declaration regarding Poland on thaiFriday; but before it was made the Soviet Ambassador was infor-medof the purport of the statement. As soon as ever it was arranged,it was communicated to him. The Soviet Ambassador told theForeign Secretary, on the 81st March, that Soviet policy had recentlybeen defined by M. Stalin as assistance against aggression for thosewho fought for their independence, and the Foreign Secretaryreceived that definition as one would expect it to be received byall of us who wish to get the maximum help from all possible quarters.I think the House will see that the principles by which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were moved to make their Polish declaration wereprecisely the same as M. Stalin&apos;s own declaration.It seemed to us, and it seems to us now, self-evident that these principles were not misunderstood by the Soviet Government, andI wish the House plainly to understand that, while these things are more difficult to negotiate with a very large number of Powers than might appear, there is no truth in the suggestion that we have beenseeking to find means of avoiding taking Soviet Eussia into that system which it is our object to build up as a system of peace against aggression. Since then my Noble Friend has seen the soviet ambassador on more than one occasion and has kept him fully informed of the progress of events. I have endeavoured to statewdiat has happened, checking it by the documents which I have beforeme,&apos; and I say that it shows that there is no justification for the suggestions which have been made, and indeed, considering the peril
in which the free countries of the world now stand, we should befools if we did not recognise where assistance might be drawn andgladly received.Mr. Dalton: May I just remind the right hon. gentleman of aquestion I put? Have the Government at any time proposed tothe Russians a definite military alliance between this country, france and  the Soviet Union? Have they proposed it and, if so, has itbeen rejected?Sir J. Simon: I beg the right hon. gentleman&apos;s pardon. I had intended as a matter of fact to say a word about that. I will meetthe point and deal with it in another way. There is no objection on our part in principle to such a pi-oposition at all. These things are not always as simple as they may appear, but whatever is themost effective way of organising the forces of peace is the way thatFfis Majesty&apos;s Government will wish to choose. I do not think,powerful as Russia is, that we ought to concentrate the whole ofour gaze simply upon that Great Power we have to remember thatthere are others even nearer to danger than Russia is. But, though cannot say that that particular proposition has been made, the hon. gentleman and the House may take it that the Governmentis raising no objection in principle to any such proposition.No. 22.Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscow).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, April 14, 1989.In spite of difficulties which stand in the way of any close asso-ciation of the Soviet Government in the system of international collaboration which His Majesty &apos;s Government and the FrenchGovernment are engaged in organising, I am reluctant to abandonmy efforts to secure some measure of co-operation from the SovietGovernment.2. These difficulties arise not merely from the reluctance ofcertain Governments to be openly associated in any way with theSoviet Union and from any suspicion, real or assumed, that theSoviet Government may have of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the French Government, but also from a naturaltendency of the Soviet Government to stand aloof, a tendency whichmay be enhanced by the very success of our efforts to secure the collaboration of other Governments.8.&quot; We gave full weight to the Soviet proposal for a conferenceand we only abandoned our own suggestion for a four-power declaration when it was clear that the attitude of the Polish Govern-inent made its conclusion impossible. We have explained our difficulties to the Soviet Government at every stage and made clear to them the reasons why we have found it necessary to embark on
the course we are now pursuing. That course has already beenattended by a great measure of success, and we consider it vital topress on with it in order to secure the adherence of as many powers as possible.4. The Soviet Government have criticised our action on whatseems to me the rather academic ground that any attempt to makea. stand at one point merely diverts the probability of an attack toanother. Rut this criticism, whether well founded or not, seems tome to have lost a good deal of its force now that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and France have supplemented the arrangement they reached with Poland by an undertaking to go to the help of Eoumaniain the event of a threat to the independence of Eoumania which thelatter considered it vital to resist. The Soviet Union are also aware that His Majesty&apos;s Government are in consultation with the TurkishGovernment: and it is their intention, in concert with the FrenchGovernment, to reach, if possible, with Turkey an agreement on thesame principle as the recent agreement with Poland.5. The situation which His Majesty*s Government and theFrench Government contemplate, therefore, is one in which theywill have given guarantees to the two countries, Poland andEoumania. which cover the greater part of the western frontier ofthe Soviet Union and to a country. Turkey, which is a friendlyneighbour of the Soviet Union in the Black Sea. Tn making these arrangements. His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Govern-ment have not regarded the principle of reciprocity as being in allcases indispensable.fi. His Majesty&apos;s Government have noted M. Stalin&apos;s recentstatement that the Soviet Union stands for the rendering of support to nations which are victims of aggression and which fight for their independence. It would therefore seem to be in complete accord with this policy were the Soviet Government now to make a public declaration on their own initiative in which, after referring to thegenera] statement of policy alluded to above and to statementsrecently made by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Govern-merit they would repeat that, in the event of any act of aggression against any European neighbour of the Soviet Union which wasresisted by the country concerned, the assistance of the SovietGovernment would be available, if desired, and would be afforded insuch manner as would be found most convenient. A positivedeclaration by the Soviet Government at the present moment would.I believe, have a steadying effect upon the international situationand would be a concrete application of the general policy of theSoviet Government as stated above.7. T shall be glad if you will speak to M. Litvinov on the linesof the present telegram and enquire whether it would be possible forthe Soviet Government to act in the sense suggested.
Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscoiv).Sir, Foreign Office, April 14, 1939.The Soviet Ambassador called on me this afternoon to informme, on instructions from his Government, that, in view of theinterest shown by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the fate of greece and Eoumania, the Soviet Government were prepared to take partin giving assistance to Eoumania. The Soviet Government wishedto learn the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the best methods in which such assistance could be given and as to the part the various Powers concerned could play in helping Eoumania.2. I thanked M. Maisky for his communication and told him that I had had it in my mind to ask him to come and see me inorder to tell him that I was proposing to inform the Soviet Govem-ment that I had been thinking over my last conversation with the ambassador and had been trying to find a way of bridging the differences between our points of view, of which we both were aware.1 had had it in mind that the Soviet Government might perhaps feelthat the position had been modified by the guarantee which we had given to Eoumania. I had been looking again at the speech ofM. Stalin, to which the Ambassador had drawn my attention, andhad been wondering whether, in view of what we had already done for Poland and Eoumania and hoped to do for Turkey, and in viewof the fact that in these cases we were not insisting on strictreciprocity, the Soviet Government would consider making a similarunilateral declaration in respect of Eoumania and perhaps of Poland,such as would put our two countries on a similar footing and therebycontribute towards meeting the differences in our points of view.This. I added, seemed to be in harmony with the communication which the Ambassador had just made to me. and I accordingly pro-posed to instruct you to speak to M. Litvinov on the above lines. Tsuggested that it might be helpful if I were also to send instructionsto Warsaw and Bucharest, urging that, if the Soviet Governmentwere to make the unilateral declarations which I had proposed, these would be unlikely to cause the Polish and roumanian Governmentsany embarrassment and should be given favourable consideration.3. M. Maisky said that he did not know what his Governmentsreaction would be to the proposal for unilateral declarations whichI had made. I pointed out that my proposal only gave precisionto what I understood that M. Stalin had said, but M. Maisky repeated that he was unable to say whether his Government woidd think sucha step necessary.   His instructions referred solely to Eoumania.4. T told M. Maisky that I had always taken the view that,wherever the attack might come, the problem which would arisewould always be essentially the same. This, M. Maisky said, broughtone back to the idea of collective security. To this I replied thatthere was, however, a difference, in that under the old idea of[20469] b
collective security we sometimes deluded ourselves into thinking thatwords were the same as action. I added that I was most grateful tothe Ambassador for his communication, which T would conveyimmediately to the Prime Minister.5. Before leaving, M. Maisky said that at his last interviewhi1 had formed the impression that the guarantee from this countryto Eoumania was not imminent, and that he had, therefore, been completely surprised to learn yesterday of the pledge which we had given, and he asked why we had changed our minds. I replied thaiT would tell him frankly that, although we had thought il desirableto clarify the attitude of Poland and Turkey before giving aguarantee, the French Government had felt that tin1 danger toHoumania was pressing and that it would therefore he unwise to delay, and that we had accordingly agreed to give our guaranteeforthwith. M. Maisky told me that lie felt sure that we had dons-right. Roumania was. in his view, in much greater danger thanPoland, and the pledge we had given to the Roumanian Governmentwould steady the situation.I am. &amp;c.halifax.No. 24.Sir W.

He gave proposal a friendlyhearing and promised to consult his Government. He was inclined to think that a unilateral declaration hound the Soviet government without committing anyone else and without knowing nature ormethod of assistance which might he required from this country.I pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Government were committed u]to the hilt, that question of actual assistance was too complicated and too dependent on the course of events to allow of settlementat present, and that a unilateral declaration was most consonant withthe position of Soviet Union as a Great Power.2.

He said that the SovietGovernment wished first of all to have reply to enquiry made bytheir Ambassador!&apos; as to nature of assistance which would be required from the various Powers concerned for protection of Eoumania.2. T reminded him of what you bad said to the Ambassador atthe time and of appreciation which I had conveyed to M. Litvinovpersonally yesterday in accordance with your instructions,X when Ihad pointed out that your proposal for a declaration was not onlyin harmony with the Ambassadors communication but also extendedit in accordance with the Soviet Governments own idea that itwas advisable to cover as many points as possible instead of only one.3. He said that the Ambassador had been, on his Governmenfsinstructions, answering a specific question you had addressed to him :Soviet Government bad, through the Ambassador, replied to HisMajesty&apos;s Government that they were ready in principle to come toRoumanians assistance, but that they wanted to know how far GreatBritain and other countries were prepared to go when it came to thepoint and what was expected from the Soviet Union. They wanted an answer to that before considering a declaration which, if made atpresent, would commit them blindly. To my argument thatexamination of the moans of assistance would take time, M. Litvinovasked why there was any need for urgency. Did we really thinkan attack was imminent? What were Poland and Eoumania doing?Negotiating perhaps with Germany? Roumanian Minister for ForeignAffairs was going to Berlin and it would lie foolish to make a declara-tion at a time when Eoumania might be willingly signing awaysomething at Germany&apos;s command.4. I pointed out (hat engagements which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had taken were an answer to those questions : we had made our position clear to the world and hoped that Soviet union would similarly announce publicly the determination to help the victims of aggression; we knew and welcomed Soviet Governmentsreadiness to assist Eoumania, but Europe was still in the dark. Hesaid, when pressed, it might come to a public declaration but repeated that at present they must have the facts to go on.5. On terminating a friendly interview I said while disappointed1 was glad that the Soviet Governments attitude in regard to assistance to Eoumania marked at any rate a step in advance.
Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, April 18, 1939.M. Litvinov has now handed me in writing following proposal which is also being communicated to French Government throughSoviet Ambassador in Paris: ** Subsequent to English enquiry regarding consent of soviet union to render assistance to States lying on its borders againstaggressors, Soviet Government also received a French proposal on lines of bilateral obligations regarding mutual military assistance against aggressors. As we regard this proposal as an acceptable one in principle and wish to extend M. Bonnefs idea,and as we are also desirous of placing relations between the threeStates on a solid foundation, we are endeavouring to combineEnglish and French proposals in the form of following proposi-tions which we submit for consideration of British Government:&quot; 1. England. France and Soviet Union to conclude with one another an agreement for a period of five to ten years, by whichthey would oblige themselves to render mutually forthwith allmanner of assistance, including that of a military nature, in caseof aggression in Europe against any one of the contractingPowers.&quot; 2. England, France and Soviet Union to undertake to renderall manner of assistance, including that of a military nature, to eastern European States situated between Baltic and Black Seasand bordering on Soviet Union, in case of aggression against these States.&quot; 3. England, France and Soviet Union to undertake todiscuss and to settle within shortest period of time extent andforms of military assistance to be rendered by each of these states in fulfilment of paragraphs 1 and 2.&quot; 4. English Government to explain that assistance promised to Poland concerns exclusively aggression on the part of Germany.&quot;5. The treaty of alliance, which exists between Poland and roumania, is to he declared operative in ease of aggression of anynature against Poland and Eoumania, or else to be revokedaltogether as one directed against Soviet Union.&quot; 6. England. France and Soviet Union to undertake, followingoutbreak of hostilities, not to enter into negotiations of any kindwhatsoever, and not to conclude peace with aggressors separately from one another and without common consent of the throePowers.7. An agreement on above lines to be signed simultaneously with terms of convention, which has been described above under paragraph 3.
&quot; 8. The necessity is recognised for England, France and soviet Union to enter into joint negotiations with Turkey, having in view conclusion of a special agreement on mutual assistance.&quot;M. Litvinov explained that French Charge d&quot;Affaires, whensupporting yesterday His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposal for a unilateral declaration by Soviet Government, had stated FrenchGovernment were not thereby withdrawing their own proposal for aFranco-Soviet pact of mutual assistance. Present Soviet proposal was as stated above a combination of both, clause 2 being specially designed to meet His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s suggestion.Clause -1 was, he said, inserted because recent British declarationof assistance to Poland might he read as implying the possibility of aggression by Soviet Union.Clause ii was required in view of tin; fact that existing Polish-Roumanian Treaty had been originally aimed at the Soviet Uniononly.Clause 7 was necessary as previous experience had shown that difficulties arose where military agreements were only negotiatedsubsequently to political conventions.Clause 8 was designed to cover possibility that Turkish Govern-inent might wish to confine its liabilities to Balkan or Mediterraneanareas.No. 27.Viscount Halifax to Sir IT&apos;. Seeds (Moscow).Sir. Foreign Office, April 29, 1989.I asked the Soviet Ambassador to call on me to-day on his return from Moscow. I told his Excellency that we had hoped to bein a position before now to send a reply to the carefully considered and very valuable proposals that we had recently received from theSoviet Government. The nature of the Soviet proposals had beensuch that we had felt it necessary to consult the French government before ourselves sending a reply.2. Meanwhile there was one matter in regard to which I couldnot but think that the Soviet Government were under some misapprehension-liension as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It seemedto me, reading the Soviet: Government proposals, that they fearedlest under our suggestions it might so turn out that the SovietGovernment would be committed in certain circumstances to helpPoland and Boumania, without Great Britain and France themselvesbeing involved. If this was, in fact, in the mind of the SovietGovernment, it was a mistaken conclusion, inasmuch as the wholeessence of our suggestion had been that, owing to the particularpolitical difficulties of which we were all aware, the Soviet Govern-
inent might offer their assistance in whatever form might seemappropriate, if and when desired, but only in circumstances in which,our own guarantees would ex hypothesi have been called into opera-tion. The Ambassador said that this was an important point andthat he would make it plain to M. Litvinov.8. M. Maisky asked whether we expected to he able to send our reply to the Soviet Government in the course of next week, and !told him that, while it was impossible for me to be sure about anyprecise date, T should certainly wish to do so at the earliest possible moment. The Ambassador said that ho was at my disposal if therewere any points arising out of the Soviet Government telegram about which we felt further elucidation to be necessary, and I assured him that I, on my side, also held myself available for consultation at anytime that he might desire.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.No. 28.Viscount Halifax to Sir IF. Seeds (Moscow).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, April 29, 1939.Your telegram of 18th April. *1. His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered the latest soviet proposal and are in consultation with the French Government as tothe reply to be returned to it. They are also in communication withthe Polish and Roumanian Governments. I hope to be able to send you instructions before very long. Meanwhile, I would ask you to clear up with M. Litvinov the misunderstanding referred to in yourtelegram of 16th April, t2. I do not recall having put to the Soviet Ambassador adirect question as to what form of assistance the Soviet Govern-ment could give to Roumania. Nor was I conscious that the soviet ambassador regarded himself as giving a reply to a specific questionof mine when, on 14th April, he informed me that the Soviet Govern-ment were prepared to take part in giving assistance to Roumania.and asked our views as to the best methods by which such assistance could b? given and as to the part the various Powers concerned couldplay in helping Poumania.3. I did not think it necessary to discuss with him in detail atthat stage the answer to these enquiries of his, since his communi-cation to me had synchronised with a new suggestion of my own(communicated to you in my telegram of 14tli april and summarisedby me to the ambassador) which it seemed to me might bridge the differences between the points of view of the two Governments.
I. I do not understand why Soviet Government should affect tobelieve that flis Majesty&apos;s Government are not committed by the declarations they have made to Poland and Eoumania. The language of those declarations (as a&apos;so of the declaration to Greece) makes itclear that, in the event of any action being taken which clearlythreatened the independence of these countries and which the latterconsidered it vital to resist. His Majesty&apos;s Government would feelthemselves hound at once to lend them all the support in their power. The first condition is that there should be resistance to adear threat to national independence. If such resistance were offered, His Majesry&apos;s Government would intervene.5. It was on the strength of that definite commitment on our part that I suggested that the Soviet Government should for their part make the declaration which I have proposed to them.No. 29.Sir II&apos;.

Seeds (ifoscoir).Sir, Foreign Office. May 6, 1989.T asked the Soviet Ambassador to call on me this morning.1 told his Excellency, as I had informed him last week, that we hadbeen in consultation with other Governments concerned as to theproposals received from the Soviet Government, and that we were now, so far as these consultations were concerned, almost ready tosubmit our reply to the Soviet Government. We had, in deference to the views expressed by the Soviet Government, somewhat modifiedour own suggestions and the formula that we had put forward, though must tell him that on the main line we were still disposed to feelthat our method of procedure seemed to us the best.2. Before communicating, however, with his Government. Ishould like to ask him if he felt able to tell me whether the recent
changes in personnel in Moscow should ho hold to signify any changein policy. Should we assume that the Russian proposals still held the field?3. M. Maisky at once replied that no change of policy was to beassumed from the recent departure of M. Litvinov, and that accordingly the Russian proposals did still hold the field. I saidthat I was glad to hear this, and that, in the light of this knowledge,I hoped we should be able to make our communication to Moscow inthe course of the next day or two. The Ambassador asked me whether could give him any indication of what were the modifications thaiwe had introduced. T said that I thought our reply would take theform of a somewhat detailed examination of the proposals actuallymade by the Soviet Government, and that, in particular, it wouldmake plain what had not been plain in the earlier suggestion,t&apos;.e., that we were not inviting the Soviet Government to accept any commitment except in conditions under which this country andFrance would themselves be actively engaged in hostilities. In thecourse of discussion, in which the Ambassador developed familiararguments in support of the Russian plan. I told his Excellency that what I conceived to bo the real difference between us was that theRussian plan, in fact, amounted to a triple alliance between GreatBritain, France and Russia. For that from our point of view therewas no doubt a groat deal to be said, but it did seem to us veryclearly to involve this consequence. Inasmuch as in the circuin-stances which we had in contemplalion we should be involved in hostilities on behalf of Roland or Roumania, I ho Russian plan didautomatically involve, through the terms of the hypothetical alliance.Soviet support for Poland and Roumania, and this was exactly whatall our information led us to believe would cause great embarrassment to those countries, and in their view might very well provoke thevery thing we all wished to avert. The difference between us was really one of form, though admittedly the difference of form was ofgreat importance, and the practical result of the plan wo suggested would, in fact, be the same as that desired by the Soviet Govern-ment, with only this difference that our plan did not carry the greatdisadvantages of causing immediate difficulties to those whom weboth desired to help. I begged the Ambassador, even if he could not bring himself to think that we were right in preference for our own proposals, to assure his Government that they were put forward inall good faith and sincerely designed to effect the purpose of providingdeterrents to aggression which we. not less than the Soviet government-ment. desired to do. With this the Ambassador readily concurred,while still expressing regret that we felt difficulty about acceptingwhat seemed to him the more logical, the more complete and themore effective Russian plan.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.
Viscount Halifax to Sir IF. Seeds (Moscoiu).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, May 6, 1939.Your telegram of 18th April.*1. His Majesty&apos;8 Government have given careful and sympathetic consideration to the counter-proposal of the Soviet Governmentcommunicated in your telegram under reference. They muchappreciate the readiness which the Soviet Government have shownin making their contribution towards the object which both Govern -merits have in view. His Majesty&apos;s Government regret that theyhave not been able to return their comments on the Soviet planat an earlier date. But such delay as has occurred has beenunavoidable not only because they have felt it right themselves toexamine the Soviet plan with all the care that so important aproposal deserves, hut also because they have been in duty boundlo communicate with other interested Governments before reachingtheir own conclusions.2. I have already instructed you in my telegram of 29th Apriltto clear up a misunderstanding which had apparently arisen as tothe intention underlying the proposal made by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the Soviet Government on 14th April. I would take this opportunity of repeating that when His Majesty&apos;s government made their proposal to the Soviet Government it was no part of their intention that the Soviet Government should commit themselves to intervene on behalf of Poland and Boumania irrespective of whetherGreat Britain and France had already intervened. If the SovietGovernment wished to make their own intervention contingent onthat of Great Britain and France, His Majesty&apos;s Government fortheir part would have no objection.3. Furthermore, His Majesty&apos;s Government would point outthat in the formula suggested by them to the Soviet Government on14th April the reason for confining Soviet assistance to cases in whichassistance was desired, and to forms winch would be acceptable tothe Governments concerned, is to be found in the attitude of theGovernments to which assistance would be rendered, rather thanthat of His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves. Our object is toarrange early help and protection for Poland and Boumania as thecountries most immediately threatened, in the form best calculated to act as an effective deterrent to any aggression upon them. Ifseemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the formula which we suggested to the Soviet Government taken together with the assurances already given to Poland and Boumania by Great Britainand France would be the best way of securing this, though in effectwe were asking the Soviet Government to commit themselves lesscompletely than we were committed ourselves, in that they were only invited to pledge themselves to give assistance if desired, and ex kypothesi only to intervene when France and Great Britain do so.* No. 26. f No. 28.[20469] T
4. Our main criticism of the new proposal now made by theSoviet Government is that, though logically complete, it takes too little account of practical difficulties and would require too long atime for its negotiation. Under point 2 of the Soviet proposals theSoviet Union would be bound automatically to render military assistance to Poland and Roumania in case of aggression against those States. We know the difficulties that this presents to thePolish and Roumanian Governments. The same difficulty existsindirectly in connexion with point 1. A promise by the SovietGovernment of automatic assistance to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin cases where the latter are involved in war in discharge of commit-ments in favour of Poland and Roumania would seem inevitablyto involve Polish and Roumanian Governments in the same positionas that which they find so embarrassing in the case of direct assistance.5. In the arrangements which we have in mind the key positionsare occupied by Poland and Turkey. In the case of Turkey, nodifficulty arises so far as the Soviet Union is concerned. WitliPoland, however, as has already been pointed out, the case is different. The hesitation of the Polish Government to be too closely associated with the Soviet Union in political arrangements is wellknown to the Soviet Government. The Polish Government are convinced that if they were to enter into any public association withthe Soviet Union, this would he regarded by the German government as an unnecessary provocation and would involve grave risk of war which ought to be avoided. The same considerations apply in thecase of the Roumanian Government.6. For these reasons we believe the time is not yet ripe for the comprehensive counter-proposal which the Soviet Government havemade to us. His Majesty&apos;s Government are still disposed to feelthat the better plan is to start from what is immediately practicable and to build upon that basis. The primary task must be to erectthe first essential barrier against aggression in Eastern Europe by making arrangements for the safety of those States most directlymenaced. In this task His Majesty&apos;s Government would alwaysattach great importance to the association with their efforts of theSoviet Government. They are in fact fully conscious that the supportthat might be afforded by the Soviet Government to Eastern european countries would be of the utmost value in case of war, and thatthe prospect of such support would act as a powerful deterrent against aggression. Their whole effort has accordingly been directed to finding means by which the difficulties alluded to above may be avoided or overcome. It was with this purpose that His Majesty&quot;?Government proposed that the Soviet Government should of theirown volition make a declaration which they are convinced wouldsteady the situation by showing the willingness of the SovietGovernment to collaborate and which at the same time would notdisturb the possible beneficiaries of Soviet assistance. By thisproposal the Soviet Government would lend their assistance, in
whatever form seemed most desirable, to States victims of aggression and themselves determined to resist, who wished to take advantageof it. The original proposal made to the Soviet Government was designed for the purpose of giving effect to this idea.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government have, however, in the light of theSoviet counter-proposal and of their consultations with other Govern-ments, revised the proposal which they originally made to the SovietGovernment, and they would now submit it in the following form : &quot;It is suggested that the Soviet Government should makea public declaration on their own initiative in which,  afterreferring to the general statement of policy recently made byM. Stalin, and having regard to statements recently made byHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government acceptingnew obligations on behalf of certain Eastern European countries,the Soviet Government would undertake that in the event ofGreat Britain and France being involved in hostilities in fulfilment of these obligations, the assistance of the Soviet Government wouldbe immediately available, if desired, and would be afforded insuch manner and on such terms as might be agreed.&quot;8.   You will observe that this formula does, in fact, give theSoviet Government a reciprocal assurance of common action, sincethe declaration which we would suggest to be made by them onlyplaces them under a conditional obligation, in a case where exhypothesi Great Britain and France are already engaged.9. You should speak to Commissar for Foreign Affairs on theforegoing lines.No. 32.Sir IF. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.i Telegraphic.) Moscow, May 8, 1939.Your telegram of 6th May.*I called on M.

I eventually said thatHis M-&apos;jesty&apos;s Government considered that &apos; issue ofsuggested declaration by Soviet Government without start-ihg military talks \vas all that was required at the moment,but I was sure that, if friendly consideration were givento our suggestion, His Majesty&apos;s Government would he glad to discuss such points as might arise therefrom.(In M.

I answered that such was not the impression sofar as I knew, either of His Majesty&apos;s Government or ofFrench Government. He said Poland was only directlymentioned in point 2 of Soviet proposals, but what aboutpoint 1?

He repeated that Soviet policy had not changed, but added cryptic remark that it was liable to be alteredif the other States changed theirs.7.

obligations to he incurred by the Soviet Government on the one bawl,and by France and Great Britain on the other, reciprocal in character, hut his Government felt great doubt whether our formula&quot;in fact did this, and it seemed to them that there was somepossibility of the Soviet Government being involved either in advanceof France and ourselves or alone.8. I went through the draft with M. Maisky, and drew hisparticular attention to the words we bad added to this formula, &quot; inthe event of Great Britain and France being involved in hostilities in fulfilment of these obligations.&quot; Wo had added these words forthe express purpose of making it clear to the Soviet Government thatwe were not asking (hem to do anything that we were not ex hypothesidoing oprselves.-1. M- Maisky replied to this by saying that there were manyways in which the strategical position might develop and that I hadnot wholly succeeded in removing bis doubts. I told him that, while1 had never attempted to disguise from myself the particulardifference of the approach to the problem that had been made by theSoviet Government and ourselves, I did not think that on thisparticular point there was any room for doubt. I went on to assurehim that, if his Government would set down precisely the point onwinch they felt misgiving, we would do our best lo meet it, and Iventured to hope that if they put us in full possession of their doubtsi could either show them that the draft in fact covered them, or Ishould hope that we could so amend it as to make our purposeindisputably plain.5. lie agreed that the purpose to which his observations were directed was to secure that, in the event of Russia being involved by her promise to render help to Poland and ltoumania, she would notbe rendering it alone. I repeated that I could not believe that there could be great difficulty in meeting this anxiety, always providedthat the Soviet Government were not expecting us to travel outsidethe two conditions which we had attached to our guarantee, namely,it) that the independence of Poland or Boumania should be plainlythreatened (his Excellency interjected: &quot;Direct or indirect&quot;?&quot;);(2) that these countries were determined to resist with their national forces.6. M. Maisky seemed gratified by my explanation, and promised to submit a note of the actual point his Government might wish toraise.7. 1 also drew the attention of the Ambassador to the concludingwords of the formula, &quot;on such terms as might be agreed.&quot; these words, I told him, we had also added to satisfy the Soviet Governmentthat they would have some liberty of action in the discharge of theobligation that they might be willing to undertake; and that, while fully recognised the undesirability of leaving all these discussionsuntil the outbreak of war. we were, on the other hand, concerned to
introduce the great steadying factor that would be made by such a russian declaration as we had provided, and that it might be possiblethei-eafter to develop the situation in greater detail.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.No. 84.Reply of the Prime Miyiister to Questions in the House of commons on May 10, 1939.The Prime Minister: I have seen the statement to which theright hon. gentleman refers and which seems to be based upon some misunderstanding of the suggestions actually put forward by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to the Soviet Government. Though conver-sations are still in progress and the House will not, therefore, expectme to discuss these matters in detail, I think it right, in view of this statement, to place the House in possession of the general line onwhich the conversations have been hitherto proceeding.As the House is aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government recentlyaccepted a definite obligation in respect of certain Eastern european states. They did this in pursuance of their declared policy of assisting those States to resist any attempt, if such were made, to threaten their independence. His Majesty&apos;s Government undertookthese obligations without inviting the Soviet Government to parti-participate directly in them, in view of certain difficulties to which, as theHouse is well aware, any such suggestion would inevitably give rise.His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly suggested to the SovietGovernment that they should make, on their own behalf, a declarationof similar effect to that already made by His Majesty&apos;s Government,in the sense that, in the event of Great Britain and France beinginvolved in hostilities in discharge of their own obligations thusaccepted, the Soviet Government, on their side, would express their readiness also to lend assistance, if desired. Such a declaration, ifthe Soviet Government feel able to make it, seems to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be in accord with the recent pronouncement ofM. Stalin, that it is the policy of the Soviet Government to supportcountries which might be victims of aggression and which wereprepared to defend their own independence.Almost simultaneously the Soviet Government suggested a scheme at once more comprehensive and more rigid which, whatever other advantages it might present, must in the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment inevitably raise the very difficulties which their own proposals had been designed to avoid. His Majesty&apos;s government accordinly pointed out to the Soviet Government the existence ofthese difficulties. At the same time, they made certain modifications in their original proposals. In particular, they made it plain thatit was no part of their intention that the Soviet Government should
commit themselves to intervene, irrespective of whether Great Britainand France had already, in discharge of their obligations, done so.His Majesty&apos;? Government added that, if the Soviet government wished to make their own intervention contingent on that of GreatBritain and France, His Majesty&apos;s Government for their part wouldhave no objection.My noble friend yesterday saw the Soviet Ambassador, whoexplained to him that the Soviet Government were still not clear whether under the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government circum-stances might not arise in which the Soviet Government would be committed to intervention unsupported by His Majesty&apos;s government or France. My noble friend assured the ambassador that this was definitely not the intention of the proposal made by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and that, if there were any room for doubt on this point,my noble friend anticipated that it could without difficulty be removed.He accordingly invited the Soviet Ambassador to place His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in possession of the precise grounds on which these doubts of his Government were based, if they still existed, and this the Soviet Ambassador readily agreed to do.I should add that the British Ambassador in Moscow had an interview two days ago with M. Molotov. at the conclusion of which m. Molotov promised that the Soviet Government would give carefulconsideration to our proposals, and we are now awaiting their reply.Mr. Dalian : Would it not be a good thing, in order to speed upthese very slow negotiations, the slowness of which is causing graveapprehension in the country, that Lord Halifax should proceed to moscow and have a straightforward discussion with M. Molotov?The Prime Minister: I think we had better await the reply of theSoviet Government and then we shall see what further steps arerequired.Mr. Mander: The Prime Minister has been good enough to explain to the House the policy put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government toRussia, and will he be good enough at the same time to explain theso-called rigid proposals of the Bussian Government which the BritishGovernment have been unable to accept?The Prime Minister: I do not think it is necessary for me to addanything to the statement I have made.Mr. Attlee: May I take it from the Prime Minister that in these negotiations we are keeping in the closest touch with the FrenchGovernment, in order that the views of all three Governments maylie clear before the making, as we hope, of a firm agreement against aggression?The Prime Minister: Yes. Sir. we are keeping in the closest touch with the French Government continuously.Mr. Thurtle: Will the Prime Minister assure the House that theGovernment regard the conclusion of these negotiations as a matterof real urgency?
No. 35.Viscount Halifax to Sir IF. Seeds (Moscow).Sir, Foreign Office, May 11, 1939.During the course of a conversation with the Soviet Ambassadorthis morning f asked his Excellency whether he had any furtherinformation as yet from his Government in regard to what had seemedto be a misunderstanding of the British formula, to which we had referred in our last conversation. M. Maisky said that he hadreceived no instructions as yet, but again developed the insistence ofThe- Prime Minister: We regard it as of the greatest importance and of real urgency.Mr. A. Henderson: Can the House take it that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have not finally closed their minds to, if circumstancesnecessitate, the conclusion of a military alliance with Eussia?The Prime Minister: T cannot answer a hypothetical question.Discussions are going on on certain lines, and we are very hopeful that they will soon come to a satisfactory issue.Mr. Benjamin Smith: Could the Prime Minister tell us whetherthe terms set out would include, if Great Britain found herselfattacked by an aggressor, assistance by Russia to this country?The Prime Minister: I made a careful and full statement, and Ithink it is very much better that I should not add to it.Sir Archibald Sinclair: Do the Governments proposals eontem-plate only the contingency of war? Do they not also contemplate the contingency of peaceful negotiations, and is there any assurance toRussia that, if peaceful negotiations are entered into, Russia will bea party to those negotiations?The Prime Minister: What the negotiations are contemplating isah act of aggression.Mr. Noel-Baker: Can the Prime Minister confirm the point thatthe guarantee given to Poland does not in any way preclude an alliance with Russia, and thai Colonel Beck gave express assuranceson that point?The&apos; Prime Minister: Does the hon. member mean an alliance between this country and Eussia?Mr. Noel-Baher: Yes.The Prime Minister: No, that is not excluded.Mr. Noel-Baker: And did Colonel Beck raise no objection?77(c Prime Minister: I did not say that at all. The questionwhich the hon. member asked me was whether the arrangement with Poland excluded the possibility of an alliance between thiscountry and Eussia. and to that I said &quot;No.&quot;
[20469]ghis Government on the necessity for complete reciprocity. In thecourse of conversation he developed his meaning by saying that theSoviet Government might find itself involved in war in virtue of commitments undertaken by them in regard to Baltic States, towardswhom His Majesty&apos;s Government had no obligation. In such a casethe Soviet Government could count on no support from us. To this1 replied that the proposal of the Soviet Government to build up asystem of guarantees very much wider than we had ourselvessuggested or undertaken might or might not lie a good plan. But it did not seem to me to afford any evidence of lack of reciprocity in theproposals that we ourselves had put forward. Those proposalsconcerned only Poland and Roumania, and, in regard to thosecountries, it seemed to me quite plain that the obligations we wereinviting the Soviet Government to undertake were identical witli thosewe ourselves had assumed. It might, indeed, be our view that theywere not so great, inasmuch as they were conditional and not absolute.In regard to the position of the Soviet Government in relation toother hypothetical commitments they might see fit to assume, thefact that in such circumstances we were not bound by our formula to give assistance to the Soviet Government might be reckoned asbeing exactly on all fours with, the fact that the Soviet Governmentwere not bound by our formula to give any assistance to us if wewere involved with Germany, for example, in virtue of our guarantee to Belgium, or by any guarantee that we might give to any of theother smaller Western Powers. I still, therefore, failed to see how-there was any just ground for maintaining that our proposal deniedthe principle of reciprocity. It seemed to me. perhaps, that part ofthe difficulty in M. Maisky&apos;s thought consisted in the fact that he spoke of Russian assistance being rendered to France and GreatBritain, whereas, in fact, what we contemplated was Sovietassistance being rendered to Poland and Roumania. who wouldalready be assured of assistance from France and ourselves.2. In connexion with his general argument, M. Maiskymentioned military conversations and sought to establish the case that, under our proposal, the date of Anglo-French intervention would be uncertain, inasmuch as this would depend on the decisionsof the French and British General Staffs, and that, accordingly,again the Soviet Government would not exactly know when suchintervention would take place. To this I replied that our guarantee to Poland and Roumania involved us in coming immediately to their assistance, if our conditions were fulfilled, and that, if words meantanything, it was impossible for us to give any assurance more complete. M. Maisky promised again to let me have a reasoned note from his Government on the points which, in their view, requiredelucidation, and said that he hoped it would be possible to clear upa good many of them before the oostponed meeting of the council at Geneva- I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.
Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscoiv, May 14. 1989.Your telegram of 6th May.*M. Molotov handed me Soviet reply to-night as follows : &quot; Soviet Government have given careful consideration to latest proposals of British Government, which were communicated tothem on 8th May. and they have come to the conclusion that theseproposals cannot serve as a basis for organisation of a front of resistance against a further extension cf aggression in Europe.&quot;This conclusion is based on the following considerations: &quot; (1) The English proposals do not contain principle of reciprocity with regard to Union of Soviet Socialist republics, and place the latter in a position of inequality, inasmuch as they donot contemplate an obligation by England and France to guarantee the Union of Soviet Socialist republics in the event of a direct attack on the latter by aggressors, whereas England and France,as well as Poland, enjoy such a guarantee as a result of reciprocitywhich exists between them.&quot; (2) The English proposals only extend guarantee to eastern european States bordering on Union of Soviet Socialist Bepublics.to Poland and to Boumania, as a consequence of which north-western frontier of Union of Soviet Socialist republics towardsFinland, Estonia and Latvia remains uncovered.&quot; (8) On the one hand, absence of guarantee to Union of soviet Socialist Bepublics on the part of England and France in theevent of a direct attack by aggressors and. on the other hand, factthat north-western frontier of Union of Soviet Socialist Bepublicsremains uncovered may serve to provoke aggression in thedirection of Soviet Union.&quot; Soviet Government consider there are at least three indispensable-sable conditions for creation of an effective barrier by pacificStates against a further extension of aggression in Europe : (1) Theconclusion between England and France and Union of soviet socialist republics of an effective pact of mutual assistance against aggression. (2) The guaranteeing by these three Great Powers of states of Central and Eastern Europe threatened by aggression,including also Latvia, Estonia and Finland. (3) The conclusion ofa concrete agreement between England, France and Union of soviet Socialist republics as to forms and extent of assistance tobe rendered materially to each other and to the guaranteed States,failing which (without such an agreement) there is a risk that, as experience of Czecho-Slovakia proved, pacts of mutual assistancemay be ineffective.&quot;
No. 37.Extract from the Prime Minister&apos;s Sjyeecli in the House of commons on Mazj 19, 1939.1 turn to the discussions with the Government of the soviet union. I cannot help thinking that there has been some misunder-standing, because the right, hon. gentleman the Leader of theOpposition, in the conclusion of his speech, put forward an idea whichI have no doubt is held by many of his friends and supporters,namely, that the British Government were actuated in their conductof these negotiations by mistrust of Russian ideology. I have saidbefore that that is not so. I want to repeat it now. We are not concerned at all with Russian internal political doctrine. We areconcerned with the best method of building up what my right hon.friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden) hascalled a peace front. If we can evolve a method by which we canenlist the co-operation and assistance of the Soviet Union in building up that peace front, we welcome it; we want it; we attach value to it.The suggestion that we despise the assistance of the Soviet Union iswithout foundation. Without accepting any view of an unauthorisedcharacter as to the precise value of the Russian military forces, orthe way in which they would best be employed, no one would be so2. I thought it well to express regret at specific mention off inland, stating, inter alia, that we associated that country more withScandinavia than with the Baltic States, quite apart from the factthat, on our side of the Anglo-Soviet conversations, we had neverconsidered undertaking any commitments with regard to the lastmentioned. It was most important that Finland should maintainneutrality on the same lines as Norway and Sweden : this could boassured if Finland were not reminded of certain unpleasant historicalassociations with Bussia; newspaper reports that Finland had been mentioned in Anglo-Soviet conversations had already caused someemotion in that country, and the whole situation needed delicatehandling. M. Molotov listened attentively, and only suggested thatassociation of Great Britain and France with Soviet Union mightweaken Finland&apos;s suspicions.3. M. Molotov said that the main point of Soviet Governmentsreply was need for &apos;* reciprocity.&quot; When I asked whether we couldassume that question of Baltic States was of less importance than thatof laying down a more definite reciprocity in connexion with guarantee to Poland and Roumania, he answered that each point of replyfollowed logically from its predecessor.4. As regards your Lordship&apos;s message about Geneva, he thoughthe would not be able to go himself, hut Soviet Government would be properly represented on 22nd May.
4-1foolish as to suppose that that huge country, with its vast population and enormous resources, would he a negligible factor in such a situation as that with which we are confronted. I hope the right hon.gentleman will dismiss any idea that, because we do not agree withthe internal system of government of the Soviet Union, that has inany way affected our outlook in the present negotiations, or the way in which we are conducting them.The House may remember a recent statement by M. Stalin, thaiit was the policy of the Soviet Union &quot; to support States which mightbe victims of aggression, provided that they were prepared to defendtheir independence.&quot; That is our own point of view, and it appearedto indicate that the Soviet Union might be prepared to collaborate incarrying this aim into effect. But we were also aware and this is apoint which has not been referred to at all up to the present thatthe direct participation of the Soviet Union in this matter might not he altogether in accordance with the wishes of some of the countries for whose benefit, or on whose behalf, these arrangements were beingmade. We would desire to have the collaboration of all thesocountries, and we do not want to have any division among them.Accordingly, we suggested to the Soviet Government that they shouldmake a declaration with regard to Poland and Roumania similar tothe one which had been made by ourselves and France, namely, thatif Great Britain and France should be involved in conflict inconsequence of undertakings which we had given to those countries,or either of them, the Soviet Union should express its readiness to lend its assistance to Poland or Boumania, as the case might be.always provided, of course, that their assistance was desired. TheSoviet Government, apparently, thought that this offer was notreciprocal. I want to say now that the British Government havenever desired to ask the Soviet Government to do anything whichthey were not prepared to do themselves. They have always wanted the arrangement to be reciprocal, and I do really find it difficult tounderstand why it should be thought, or why it should ever havebeen thought, that the suggestion we made was lacking in reciprocity.If it be argued that it did not provide for the case of a direct attack on the Soviet Union, agreed ; but it did not provide for thecase of a direct attack on this country. The hon. member said thatit was not the same as the agreement with Turkey. If I may beallowed to say so, that is not the point. The point is, was iireciprocal? I am not saying it was the same as the agreement with turkey, or with any country. What I want to examine is, was itunfair? Did it ask of the Soviet Union something more than wewere prepared to do ourselves? It may be argued that it did not cover the ease of certain States, other than Poland and Boumania.which are neighbours of Russia, and through which perhaps she might be attacked. Again, I say, it is quite true that it did not coverthat, but, on the other hand, it equally did not apply to certainWestern States which, if attacked, might cause us ultimately to be involved in war.
Again, I am not saying whether this was the same as any othertreaty. What I am saying is that it is quite wrong to say that itwas not reciprocal. T think I made it plain that our suggestion didnot contemplate&quot; that the Soviet Government should interveneirrespective of whether Great Britain and France did so -although,as a matter of fact, our own commitments which follow upon the assurances we have given are irrespective of whether the soviet union come in. Therefore, if there he any inequality between thetwo States in the proposals which have been made, the inequalitywas in favour of the Soviet Union and not of this country. We rely on a matter of that kind because it is a question of fact, and,although I have given a little time to explaining our position, it is really because the Soviet Union really seemed to believe that we had tried to put an unfair proposal upon them, and because colour wasgiven to that view by the intervention of the right hon. gentleman.It really is a misunderstanding, and whatever can be alleged against our proposal, I am sure that it cannot he alleged truly that it wasunfair.Nevertheless, since the proposal was not acceptable to the soviet union, we tried again.   What we, above all. were anxious for was,that we should be able to come to an agreement quickly, and it is always easy to come to arr agreement quickly if you accept everything that the other side puts up.   1 do ask the 1 rouse to remember thatin this matter we are trying to build up. not an alliance between ourselves and other countries, but a peace front against aggression,arid we should not be succeeding in that policy if, by ensuring theco-operation of one country, we rendered another country uneasy andunwilling to collaborate with us.    Therefore, I suggest  to thecommittee that in this matter, which is one of great difficulty anddelicacy, a certain amount of caution is necessary, caution arising notout of ideological differences, not out of pure obstinacy, not evenbecause we think that one course serves narrow British interestsbetter than another, but because the object of our policy is to buildup this peace front.   We would rather delay for a few days longer than hastily take a step which might result in the work that we hadalready done crumbling before our very eyes.We thought that perhaps the Soviet Government might have been willing to declare its agreement with us on those matters on whichwe could agree, and that it would be prepared to let us discuss further, and at greater leisure, the subjects on which difficulties stillexisted. That, in our view, would have been a wise course to take to show agreement, and I cannot help thinking that, if we agreedeven on a part of the policy to be pursued, it would have made it easier to come to a complete agreement on the rest. I cannot helpsaying how much I regret the decisioir of the Soviet Government notto let M. Potemkin go to Geneva. The Geneva Council was postponed for a week in order to allow him to go there, but after it had been postponed we heard that he could trot go. My noble friend will,therefore, be deprived of the opportunity of discussing personally
No. 88.British Delegation, Genera, to Foreign Office.(Telegraphic.) Geneva, May 21, 1989.I (Viscount Halifax) had a conversation with M. Maisky thismorning, at which I set myself to obtain as clear a statement aspossible of his Governmenfs views. He responded freely, butemphasised that although he could assure me that his observationswere in accordance with the general line of his Governmenfs views,they must be regarded as personal explanations.2. I asked him why the Soviet Government had been unableto accept the British proposals.43. He replied that the essential thing was to prevent war. TheSoviet Government thought this could be done, but only byorganising such a combination of forces that Germany would not dareto attack. For this purpose a triple pact was necessary, and our proposals entirely ignored this element in the Soviet proposal.with him these matters, which, I think, might have been valuablefor both of us. No doubt the Soviet Government had good reasonsfor their action, but I only regret that it was not possible for thismeeting to take place. This is one of the cases in which I cannothelp feeling that there is a sort of veil, a sort of wall between thetwo Governments which it is extremely difficult to penetrate, andthat if only that opportunity had been afforded us we might have,perhaps, managed to shake bands across the gap.I am not going any further than I have gone already. Thecommittee will realise that I must walk warily, and I do not want,to say anything which will make things more difficult than they arealready. What I have said was, that we are not concerned merelywith the Russian Government. We have other Governments toconsider. There may be those who are out just to damage theGovernment or to make mischief, but those who want this policy to succeed, as His Majesty&apos;s Government do, will. T think, refrain from pressing us unduly to disclose the exact point where the difficulties arise, when I have already&apos; given them a general indication.T have nothing more to say except this. Throughout this matterwe have been in close touch with the Government of France, with whom we arc happy to have collaboration and counsel. There is no difference between us, and my noble friend the Foreign secretary will have the opportunity to-morrow for further discussions with thehead of the French Government and with their Foreign Minister.I do trust that after this consultation, and with their help, it may befound possible to overcome those obstacles which have hithertoprevented us from reaching an agreement with the Government ofthe Soviet Union, and that we shall be able iu due course to reportto the House that we have at last made a final agreement with them.
4. In the second place, our proposals were not based onreciprocity. Under them Russia would be bound to assist GreatBritain and France in the event of an attack on Poland or Roumania,but Great Britain would not be obliged to come to Russia&apos;s assistancein the event of an attack on the Baltic States.5. The weakness of our plan was that it was based on a guarantee to Poland and Roumania alone. Supposing that Roumania shouldmake friends with Germany or that. Germany should, by intimidationor bribery, bring Roumania to allow German troops to pass freelyacross Roumania to attack Russia, Great Britain would not be obligedto intervene, though Russia would be forced to fight. He agreed with my reminder that under the Franco-Soviet Pact France might haveto help Russia, but observed that this was not true of Great Britain.(). So also if Poland&apos;s policy changed, the same thing might happen in Poland. The Baltic States, too, wished to be neutral atpresent, but they might equally be intimidated or bribed into allowingGerman troops to pass through or German aerodromes to beestablished in their territory.7. Then again Russia was being asked to give Poland aguarantee, but Poland was not being asked to give Russia a guarantee.Poland might therefore be neutral in a German-Russian war, andthe character of her neutrality would be of importance to Russia.8. I repeated to him our reasons for thinking that our proposals,whatever might be said about them, were fully reciprocal.9. He admitted that from the logical or legalistic point of view this might be so, but in practice the position of the two countries would be quite different. Great Britain had a reciprocal agreementwith Poland, while Russia had none. France bad a reciprocalarrangement with Great Britain, while Russia had none. Russia was.therefore, exposed to far greater dangers than was Great Britain, andmight be left to fight alone.10. T told him that if Russia was in a situation of inequality,this was inherent in her treaty position. If we were not proposingany direct guarantee for Russia, neither were we asking any directRussian guarantee for ourselves. Indeed, her position was madebetter, not, worse, than it was before by the fact of our havingguaranteed Poland and Roumania, which were the only countriesthrough which an effective German attack could be launched on russia.11. I then suggested that it woidd go some way to meet theRussian case if it was possible to introduce a provision by whichthe border States would undertake not to allow Germany to use their territory as a passage or base of operations against Russia. he doubted whether they would be willing to make such an arrangementor that they would be able to observe it if they made it.12. M. Maisky explained that Russia had the choice of twopositions. She could, on the one hand, take care of herself and enterinto no obligations to other Powers. The advantage of this wouldbe that though she might have to defend herself single-handed, she would preserve her own liberty of action.
13. On the other hand, though she could in the long run winany war of defence single-handed, she could not single-handed preventwar in general. She was. therefore, ready to collaborate with other powers for this purpose, and though she would thereby lose herfreedom of action she would gain in return the possibility of preventing war. If she accepted the British proposals she would lose her liberty of action without getting this result in return. she would, moreover, be undertaking heavy obligations, since owing toher geographical position she would have to bear the chief brunt of resisting an attack, or the chief burden of assisting the Powers which she had guaranteed. It was for this reason that the Soviet Govern-ment thought a triple pact of mutual assistance to be essential.14. I asked him how far it would meet the Soviet view if wecould cover the Baltic States by our proposal. He replied that thiswould be an improvement, but it would not secure the main aimwhich was to prevent war in general.15. He added that if the triple pact could be arranged, tinsmaller States would no longer be shy about receiving Soviet assis-tance. Their hesitation arose from the fact that they saw a strong and well-organised aggressive block faced by an ill-organised and slowmoving peace block. I told him that I thought he very much under-estimated the difficulties in this respect, and that their hesitationarose from quite other reasons.16. 1 asked whether it would help to meet the Soviet view ifit could be provided that, should any one of the three Powers become involved in hostilities through helping any other Power that requestedtheir assistance (e.i/., the Baltic States, Yugoslavia. Belgium orHolland, as well as Poland and Boumania). then all three would hein the war together.17. He did not think that this would do, as it did not cover the case of a sudden collapse of States bordering on Russia or oftheir failure to resist.IS. I told him that, speaking frankly, I was greatly disappointedwith the attitude of the Soviet Government throughout these negotia-tions. We had made very great efforts to meet their point of view,whereas they had not changed their position at all, and had madelittle or no advance to meet us.19. He observed that, on the contrary, whereas they had putforward eight points in their original proposal* they had reduced these to three, and set aside the other five.t The Soviet government might he able to compromise on secondary points, but they could notcompromise on essentials. The triple pact was indispensable as a deterrent.20. I asked whether I correctly interpreted his point of view asfollows. The Soviet Government thought a triple pact of mutual assistance necessary, first, because by this means alone could Russiabe protected against the collapse or intimidation by germany of thebuffer States, and secondly, because the Soviet Government felt thatif they were to accept new and heavy obligations they could only* No. 26. t No. 36.
do so as part of a system that in their view gave the best hopeof preventing war.21. He agreed with this statement of his Governmenfs position.The Soviet Government were anxious that there should be nooutbreak of war anywhere.22. I asked him whether I should be right in stating the viewsof the Soviet somewhat as follows : In the event of any of the three governments being involved in hostilities with a European Power,either as a result of its giving help to another European State whichwas a victim of aggression, or as a result of a direct attack on oneof them, the other two would come to the assistance of thatGovernment.28. M. Maisky thought this was in keeping with the ideas ofthe Soviet Government.24. I asked him whether it would be the intention of the SovietGovernment to make the operation of such a pact conditional uponthe victim of aggression asking for assistance. He agreed that assistance could not be forced on those who did not desire it.25. I finally asked him whether he thought the Soviet Govern-ment would be willing that such an agreement as they were pressing for should cover not only the Eastern European States (as in theSoviet proposal), but also the smaller Western European States.He replied that he could not answer this question with authority,hut did not see any insuperable difficulty, and was sure that itcould be discussed.26. I am afraid I was unable in the course of a long conversationto shake M. Maisky at all on his main point of insistence on a triplemutual guarantee against direct aggression as against only joint actionin support of guarantees given to other States.27. I thanked M. Maisky for information be had given me buttold him that I could give him no indication of attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government which would be decided as soon as possiblein light of all the considerations of which they had to take account-No. 39.Statement by the Prime Mi7iister in the House of Commons onMay 24, 1939.The House is aware that my noble friend the Secretary ofState for Eoreign Affairs was able to have conversations withthe French Ministers in Paris on his way to Geneva. He wasalso able to continue in Geneva the conversations which had been conducted with the Soviet Ambassador in London. As a result ofthese conversations all relevant points of view have now been made clear, and I have every reason to hope that as a result of proposalswhich His Majesty&apos;s Government are now in a position to make on[20469] h
the main questions arising, it will he found possible to reach full agreement at an early date. There still remain some further points to be cleared up, but I do not anticipate that these are likely to giverise to any serious difficulty.No. 40.Viscount Halifax to Sir IF. Seeds (Moscow).iTelegraphic.t Foreign Office, May 24, 1989.His Majesty&apos;s Government, after careful consideration, are now-disposed to agree that effective co-operation between the Soviet.French and British Governments against aggression in Europe mightbe based on a system of mutual guarantees in general conformitywith the principles of the League of Nations. This would have tocoyer both direct attack on any of the three Governments by a european State, and the case where any of them was engaged in hostilities with such a State in consequence of aggression by thelatter upon another European country. The conditions of this last-named eventuality will have to be carefully worked out.2. Prime Minister made short statement in Parliament this after-noon indicating that he had every reason to hope that, as a resultof proposals which His Majesty&apos;s Government are now in a positionto make on main questions arising, it will be found possible to reachfull agreement at an early date, though there remain some further points to be cleared up.

Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscow).Draft Agreement.(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, May 25, 1989.The Governments of the United Kingdom, France and theU.S.S.R. desiring to give effect, in their capacity of members ofthe League of Nations, to the principle of mutual support against aggression which is embodied in the Covenant of the League, havereached the following agreement:I.If France and the United Kingdom are engaged in hostilities witha European Power, in consecpienee of either (1) aggression by that power against another European State which they had, in conformitywith the wishes of that State, undertaken to assist against suchaggression; (2) assistance given by them to another European state which had requested such assistance in order to resist a violation ofits neutrality; or (3) aggression by a European Power against eitherFrance or the United Kingdom, the U.S.S.E., acting in accordancewith the principles of article 16, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the covenant of the League of Nations, will give France and the United Kingdomall the support and assistance in its power.II.If the U.S.S.E. is engaged in hostilities with a European Power,in consequence of either (1) aggression by that Power against another european State which the U.S.S.R. had, in conformity with thewishes of that State, undertaken to assist against such aggression;(2) assistance given by the U.S.S.E. to another European state which had requested such assistance in order to resist a violation of its neutrality; or (3) aggression by a European Power againstthe U.S.S.R., France and the United Kingdom, acting in accordancewith the principles of article 16, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the covenant of the League of Nations, will give the U.S.S.E. all the support and assistance in their power.III.The three Governments will concert together as to the methods by which such mutual support and assistance could, in case of need,be made most effective.IV.In the event of circumstances arising which threaten to call their undertakings of mutual support and assistance into operation, thethree Governments will immediately consult together upon thesituation.The methods and scope of such consultation will at once be thesubject of further discussion between the three Governments.
V.It is understood that the rendering of support and assistance inthe above eases is without prejudice to the rights and position ofother Powers.VI.The three Governments will communicate to each other the termsof any undertakings referred to in I (1) and II (1) above whichthey have already given. Any of them which may in future be considering the giving of such an undertaking will consult the other two Governments before doing so, and will communicate to them the terms of any undertaking so given.VII.This agreement will continue for a period of (five) years from to-day&apos;s date. Not less than (six months) before the expiry of thesaid period, the three Governments will consult together as to thedesirability of renewing it, with or without modifications.No. -43.Viscount Halifax to Sir IF. Seeds (Moscow).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office. May 25, 1939.Explanatory Memorandum.Ills Majesty&apos;s Government consider it important from the pohnof view of public opinion in this country that the pact should beconnected in some way with the position of the parties as members ofthe League of Nations. On the other hand, it is obviously impossible in existing circumstances to make the operation of the pact dependenton the application of article 1G by the League, especially as, Germanyand Italy not being members of the League, the League machinerycould only be set in motion by the application of article 17, a course which it might be impossible to follow. It is, moreover, important to prevent any fears on the part of other countries that an attempt is being made to involve them, either generally under article 1(or particularly under the provision in paragraph 3 of that articleabout affording passage through their territory to the forces ofmembers of the League. For these reasons the Covenant is mentionedboth in the preamble and in articles 1 and 2 only by a reference toits principles, and the references to article lfi of the Covenant mentiononly paragraphs f and 2 of (bat article.2. Paragraphs 1 and 2 have been drafted in order to meet sofar as possible the susceptibilities of Poland, Eoumania and the baltic states. The idea is that 1 in each of these articles covers the case(Poland, Boumania, Belgium, Greece, Turkey), where one of theparties had previously given an undertaking of assistance to the
country concerned with its assent, while 2 covers the case (e.g.,Baltic States, Holland, Switzerland), where no such assurance hadbeen previously given, but where the country concerned asked forassistance in resisting a violation of its neutrality. Paragraph G isintended, in conjunction with the words &quot;in conformity with thewishes of that State&quot; in paragraphs 1 and 2, to prevent fears thatthe Soviet Union might give guarantees to countries which do not desire them.3. It will be observed that now that the pact has been madeentirely reciprocal, it makes no difference from the Franco-british point of view whether the Soviet Union give undertakings to poland and Boumania or not, because in the event of France and GreatBritain being engaged in hostilities in consequence of their under-lakings to Poland or Roumania the Soviet Union would, under paragraph 1. be bound to come to their assistance.4. The object of paragraph 5 is to indicate that the obligations of mutual assistance do not involve making use of the territory ofother Powers without their consent.No. 44.Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.iTelegraphic.) Moscow, May 27, 1939.French Charge d&apos;Affaires and I saw M. Molotov this afternoon,who was accompanied by M. Potemkin.2. M. Molotov said at once that he had already studied our proposal,* of which he had received the text from Paris, and that his personal reaction was in the negative. The impression produced onhis mind was that Great Britain and France wanted to continueconversations ad infinituiu, but were not interested in obtainingconcrete results.3. I said that His Majesty&apos;s Government, who had made so greatan effort to meet as they thought successfully the wishes of theSoviet Government, would be as astounded as I was to hear this. on what did he base his impression:&apos; He said that our introducingreferences to the League of Nations was a clear indication that wewere prepared to make effective co-operation dependent on theinterminable delays of League of Nations procedure. Soviet Govern-ment wanted immediate guarantee of effective mutual assistance against aggressors, but Great Britain and France were apparentlysatisfied with a state of affairs where Russia would be bombed by the aggressor while Bolivia blocked all action at Geneva. I explainedover and over again the reason for our allusion to the LeagueCovenant in the terms of your Lordship&apos;s instructions, but myrepeated  emphasis  on   &quot;the  spirit&quot;   and   &quot;principles&quot;   of  the
Covenant was only met by repeated insistence on the League&apos;s&quot; procedure.&quot;4. M. Molotov then used the astonishing argument why underpoint 5 we were proposing to safeguard the rights and position of an aggressor State. I explained that the point in question referred onlyto States to whom we were proposing to lend assistance, to which lieretorted that tins safeguarding of rights was typical of that &quot; reserve &quot;which he read into our proposals and which was calculated to ensurethe maximum of talk and the minimum of results. He l-epeated thatthe Soviet Government wanted effective guarantee of action, notwords and conversations.5. We urged that point 3 covered effective action as regards themethod and nature of assistance, i.e., military consultations, but heinsisted that that point as well as point 4 referred vaguely to thefuture. He said that Soviet wishes in that respect had been clearlyexpressed, hut we had not replied to them.G. After more wrangling on the League of Nations question, hesaid he had been expressing his personal views, which wereunchanged; he would report to his Government and give us the answer in due course. I suggested that the Soviet reply should beheld up until I had communicated with your Lordship in the hope of finding means to clear up the misunderstanding, but he gave me no definite reply to this.7. Assuming he was not merely manoeuvring to close negotia-tions, I can only suggest we should propose some formula which wouldprovide for two simultaneous agreements, one being pact of mutual assistance, and the second a &quot; concrete agreement as to the form and extent of assistance.&quot; But I see no possibility of meeting him onthe League of Nations question, as presumably we could not lay downin our formula that we eliminate all League &quot;procedure.&quot;No. 45.Viscount Halifax to Sir IF. Seeds (Moscow).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, May 29, 1939.Your telegram of 27th May.*I approve your language. M. Molotov is evidently under acomplete misunderstanding as to the scope and meaning of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments proposals, which are sincerely intended toprovide for effective and immediate mutual support.There is not the slightest ground for the assumption that HisMajesty&apos;s Government wish to adopt League procedure. They wishto act in accordance with League principles, and to this the SovietGovernment, as a member of the League, surely cannot reasonablyobject.   But His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to make it
clear that the operation of the agreement shall not be made dependenton League procedure. M. Molotov is equally wrong in assuming that points 3 and 4 are intended to refer vaguely to the future or to defer conclusion of concrete arrangement. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are ready to embark immediately on conversations to this end.It was felt, however, that it would be preferable, as in the case ofthe Polish and Turkish agreements, to lose no time in concludingan agreement in principle before elaborating the details. In thisrespect Soviet Government have no more reason to be suspicious thanPolish or Turkish Governments, who have shown no such anxiety inthe matter.Point 5 is intended to meet the susceptibilities of other Powers.However unjustified these may be, they cannot be disregarded. Butthis does not mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to qualify[heir undertaking to give immediate and effective support, and theyare prepared to give Soviet Government every assurance on thispoint.You should speak again to M. Molotov on above lines. his attitude is doubly disappointing in that I had understood that allthe Soviet Government wanted was complete reciprocity and aguarantee of immediate effective support. This ilis Majesty&apos;sGovernment are ready to give and their proposals have no other aim.No. 46.Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, May 29, 1939.Your telegram of 29th May.*I have just (11-45 p.m.) returned from long conversation withM. Molotov.2. I handed him practically the whole of paragraphs 2-4 of youradmirably clear explanation of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in regard to League principles and military conversations. 1think some success was achieved on former of these points and perhaps even on the latter, though he was most obstinate in insisting on what he considered lack of clearness in text of our draft, and onthe fact that point 4 provided for nothing more than &quot; consultations &quot;at moment of danger. I urged that conclusions of military talks in June&quot; 1939, under point 3, might well be inapplicable to unforeseenconditions of an imminent aggression in June 1940, and that it wasimpossible in practice to do more than we were doing, namely,promising immediate effective support in general and immediatemilitary in particular.3. Me insisted on taking me through the entire text of draft(except final two points), which involved wearisome reiteration of
much that we had previously discussed, but, he also raised at greatlength the question of States who might on Czecho-Slovak precedentcome to understanding with Germany. Did we mean not to coverGerman absorption of such States nominally with their consent? I said neither His Majesty&apos;s Government nor British public opinion would consider imposing on independent nations guarantees ofprotection against their will: such guarantees would amount tomenaces, not protection against aggression. He retorted by asking whether His Majesty&apos;s Government and British public opinion would remain loftily unaffected were Belgium, for example, to compoundwith Germany.No. 47.Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow presents his complimentsto His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of a speech ofM. Molotov, president of the Council of People&apos;s Commissars of theU.S.S.B. and People&apos;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, made on the31st May at the third session of the Supreme Council of the U.S.S.B.Moscow, June 1, 1939.Enclosure in No. 47.Speech of the President of the Council of People&apos;s Commissars ofthe U.S.S.H. and the Peoplc&apos;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs,M. Molotov, made on May 31 at the Third Session of theSupreme Council of the U.S.S.P.Comrade Deputies!The proposal of the Deputies for a statement to be made by thePeople&apos;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs at the session of the supreme council is fully understandable. Important changes have occurredrecently in the international situation. These changes have fromthe point of view of the peaceful Powers brought about a serious deterioration in the international situation.We are now faced, on the one hand, with certain results of thepolicy of the aggressor States, and, on the other hand, with thepolicy of non-intervention on the part of the democratic States.The representatives of the aggressor States are not averse at present to boasting of the results of the policy of aggression already achieved.Be that as it may, there is no evidence of lack of boasting (cheers inthe hall). The representatives of the democratic States who had given up the polic\r of collective security and were pursuing a policyof non-resistance to aggression are endeavouring to minimise the
significance of the deterioration which has occurred in the inter-national situation. They are still occupied mainly in calming publicopinion, and are acting as though nothing essential has happenedrecently.The attitude of the Soviet Union in appraising current inter-national events is different from both of these attitudes. The soviet union, as is clear to everybody, cannot be suspected of any sympathy with the aggressors. Any form of masking a real deterioration in theinternational situation is also alien to her. It is clear to us thatattempts to conceal from public opinion the real changes which have occurred in the international situation must be met with facts. Itwill then become evident that &quot;pacifying&quot; speeches and articles areonly necessary for those who do not wish to stop the further develop-ment of aggression in the hope that they may be able to directaggression, so to speak, in a more or less &quot; acceptable &quot; direction.Not long ago authoritative representatives of England and Franceendeavoured to pacify public opinion in their countries, and wereglorying in the success of the ill-starred Munich Agreement. they said that the September agreement at Munich had prevented a european war at the cost of comparatively inconsiderable concessions on the part of Czecho-Slovakia. It seemed to many even then thatthe representatives of England and France went further at Munichthan they had a right to do in their concessions at Czecho-Slovakia&apos;sexpense. The Munich Agreement was, so to speak, the culminatingpoint of the policy of non-intervention, the culminating point of compromise with the aggressor Powers. To what results did thispolicy lead? Did the Munich Agreement put a stop to aggression?Not in the least. On the contrary, Germany did not restrict herselfto the concessions received at Munich that is to say, to the receiptof Sudeten areas inhabited by Germans. Germany went further andsimply liquidated one of the large Slavonic States Czecho-Slovakia.Little lime had passed from September 1988 when the MunichConference took place when in March 1989 Germany put an end to the existence of Czecho-Slovakia. Germany succeeded incarrying this out without any opposition on the part of anybody.So smoothly did this happen that the question arises as to what wasthe real object of the conference at Munich.In any case, the liquidation of Czecho-Slovakia, despite theMunich Agreement, demonstrated to the whole world whither led the policy of non-intervention which, it might, be said, reached itsculminating point at Munich. The breakdown of this policy became evident, and yet the aggressor States continued to adhere to theirpolicy. Germany snatched from the Lithuanian Republic Memel andthe Memel Province. As we know, Italy also did not remain idle.In April Italy put an end to an independent State Albania.Following upon this it is not surprising that the head of theGerman State cancelled two important international treaties in oneof his speeches at the end of April the Naval Agreement between germany and England and the Pact of Non-Aggression between[20469] i
Germany and Poland. At one time great international significancewas ascribed to these agreements. Germany, however, disposed ofthese agreements very simply without taking account of anyformalities. Such was Germany&apos;s reply to the proposals of tin-President of the United States of America, Roosevelt, which waspermeated with the spirit of peacefulness.The matter did not stop at the denunciation of two internationaltreaties. Germany and Italy went further. During the last few-days a military-political agreement concluded between them has been published This agreement is basically of an aggressive character.According to this agreement, Germany and Italy are bound to supporteach other in any sort of hostilities undertaken by either of them,including any form of aggression and any form of offensive warfare.It is only quite recently that the rapprochement between Germanyand Italy was masked by the alleged necessity of a joint struggle against communism. For this purpose not a little fuss was made about the so-called &quot;Anti-Comintern Pact.&quot; The anti-Cominternnoise played at one point its part in distracting attention. Now the aggressors do not see the necessity of hiding behind a mask. Themilitary-political agreement between Germany and Italy does not contain a word about fighting the Comintern. On the contrary, thestatesmen and the press of Germany and Italy are definitely sayingthat this agreement is directed specially against the chief Europeandemocratic States.It seems to be clear that the facts adduced above testify to aserious deterioration in the international situation.In this connexion certain changes in the direction of resistance to aggresion are to be remarked in the policy of the non-aggressiveStates of Europe. It remains to be seen to what extent these changes are serious. At present one cannot even say whether these powers have a real desire to refrain from the policy of non-intervention andfrom the policy of non-resistance to the further development of aggression. Will it not happen that the present tendency of these powers to limit aggression to certain areas will fail to serve as a barto the development of aggression in other areas? Questions of this nature are raised in certain organs of the bourgeois press abroad.Therefore we must be vigilant. We stand for the cause of peace andfor the prevention of any sort of development of aggression. Butwe must remember the statement made by Stalin: &quot; Care should bemaintained not to allow our country to be drawn into conflicts byprovocators of war who are accustomed to pull the chestnuts out ofthe fire with other people&apos;s hands.&quot; It is only by observing this that we shall be able to defend to the end the interests of our countryand the interests of universal peace.There seem, however, to be various ,signs that the democraticStates of Europe are coming to realise more and more the breakdown of the policy of non-intervention and the necessity of more serioussearches for ways and means to create a united front of peace-lovingStates against aggression.    In such a country as England loud
demands have come to be heard as to the necessity of an abruptchange in foreign policy. We, of course, understand the differencebetween a verbal declaration and actual policy. But it is appropriate to note that these demands have not been idle ones. Here are certainfacts. No Pact of Mutual Assistance existed between England and poland. Now the decision to create such a pact has been taken. the significance of this agreement is heightened by Germany&apos;s denunciation-ciation of the Pact of Non-Aggression with Poland. It would be idleto deny that the Pact of Mutual Assistance between England and poland brings about a change in the European situation. Let us go further. There was no Pact of Mutual Assistance between Englandand Turkey, but recently a certain agreement of mutual assistance between England and Turkey has already come into being. This factalso makes for a change in the international situation.In connexion with these new facts the endeavour of the non-aggressive European Powers to attract the U.S.S.R. into collaboration in the cause of resistance to aggression has to be acknowledged as oneof the chief features of recent times. Naturally this endeavour meritsattention. On this basis the Soviet Government accepted the proposal of England and France to enter into negotiations with the object of strengthening the political relations between the L.S.S.B., Englandand France and of forming a peace front against the further develop-ment of aggression.How do we determine our problems in the present-day inter-national situation? We consider that they follow the line of theinterests of other non-aggressive States. They consist in stopping thefurther development of aggression and creating for this purpose areliable and effective defensive front of the non-aggressive Powers.In connexion with the proposals made to us by the English andFrench Governments, the Soviet Government entered into negotiationswith these two Governments, having in view the necessary measures for fighting aggression. This was in the middle of April last. Thenegotiations which then began have not yet been terminated. How-ever, it was possible then to see that if there were a desire to create an effective front of the peace-loving Powers against the advance of aggression the following conditions would be a necessary minimum :-The conclusion between England, France and the FJ.S.S.R. ofan effective Pact of Mutual Assistance against aggression having a purely defensive character.A guarantee on the part of England, France and the U.S.S.R.to the States of Central and Eastern Europe, including without exception all European States bordering on the U.S.S.R., from anattack by the aggressors.The conclusion of a concrete agreement between England.France and the U.S.S.B. as to the forms and extent of immediate and effective assistance to be rendered to each other and to the guaranteed States in case of an attack by the aggressors.
This is our view, whicu vve impose on nobody, but for which west and. We do not demand the acceptance of our point of view and donot ask this from anybody. We consider, however, that this point ofview really corresponds to the security of the peaceful States.This would be an agreement of a purely defensive characteroperative against an attack on the part of the aggressor, and radicallydifferent from the military and offensive union which was recently concluded between Germany and Italy.It is clear that the principle of reciprocity and equal obligationsmust form the basis of such an agreement.It must be noted that a favourable attitude towards this elementaryprinciple was not found in certain of the Anglo-French proposals.Having guaranteed themselves.from a direct attack by aggressors by-pacts of mutual assistance between themselves and Poland and having made sure of the help of the U.S.S.R. in case of an attack by-aggressors on Poland and Roumania, the English and French left open the question whether the U.S.S.R. in its turn might reckon on assistance on their part in case of a direct attack on it by the aggressors. Another question was left open as well, namely, whetherthey could participate in a guarantee to the small neighbouring states which cover the north-western border of the TJ.S.S.R. should thoseStates not be in a position to defend their neutrality from aggression.There arose in this way a position of inequality for the U.S.S.R.During the last few days new Anglo-French offers have beenreceived. In these offers the principle is already admitted of mutual assistance between England, France and the U.S.S.R. on a basis of reciprocity in the case of a direct attack by the aggressors. This is,of course, a step forward. One has to note, however, that it is hedgedround with such reservations, including reservations connected withcertain points of the statutes of the League of Nations, that it may-prove to be a fictitious step forward. As to the question of a guarantee to the Powers of Central and Eastern Europe, the proposals referredto show no progress at all if one looks upon the question from thepoint of view of reciprocity. They provide for assistance to theU.S.S.R. in regard to the five Powers to whom the English andFrench have already given a promise of guarantees, but they do notspeak of their assistance to the three Powers on the north-westernborders of the U.S.S.R., who may not be in a position to defend their neutrality in the case of attack by the aggressors.The Soviet Union, however, cannot assume obligations in regardto the five Powers indicated should it not receive guarantees in regardto the three countries situated on its north-western frontier. This isthe situation with regard to the negotiations with England andFrance.While conducting negotiations with England and France we see no necessity for refusing commercial relations with such countries as germany and Italy. As far back as the beginning of last year theGerman Government began negotiations for a trade agreement andnew credits.   At that time Germany offered to grant us a new credit
of 200 million marks. Inasmuch as we did not come to terms aboutibis new economic agreement the negotiations came to an end. Atthe end of 1938 the German Government again raised the questionof economic negotiations and of the granting of a credit of 200 million marks. The German offer was accompanied by a readiness tomake certain concessions. At the beginning of 1939 the PeopiVsCommissariat for Foreign Trade was informed that a special Germanrepresentative, Herr Schnurre, was leaving for Moscow in connexionwith these negotiations. Thereafter the negotiations were confided tothe German Ambassador in Moscow, Count von der Schulenhurg, in place of Herr Sehnurre, and they were interrupted in view of differences of opinion. Now there are certain indications that thenegotiations may he resumed.I may add that we recently signed a mutually satisfactory trade agreement with Italy for 1989.It is known that a special communique was published in Februarylast confirming the development of good neighbourly relationsbetween the U.S.S.B. and Poland. A certain general improvement isnow noticeable in our relations with Poland. Furthermore, the trade agreement concluded in March with Poland may considerably increasethe trade turnover between the U.S.S.B. and Poland.Our relations with friendly Turkey are developing normally. Therecent visit of Comrade Potemkin to Angora, which was undertaken for purposes of information, had a great positive effect.Among international questions which have recently acquired great significance for the U.S.S.B. it is necessary to mention the problemof the Aland Islands. - You know that these islands belonged toRussia for over a hundred years. As the result of the October revolu-tion Finland received her independence. By agreement with our country Finland also received the Aland Islands. In 1921 tenPowers: Finland, Estonia. Latvia. Poland, Sweden, Denmark.Germany, England, France and Italy, signed a convention whichprohibited, as had previously been the case, the fortification of theAland Islands. The Governments of the capitalist States did tinswithout the participation of Soviet representatives. In 1921 the soviet republic, which had been crippled by war and foreign intervention,was only able to protest against this illegal act in relation to theU.S.S.B. However, we then clearly and repeatedly stated that theSoviet Union could not ignore this question and that a change in thejuridical status of the Aland Islands in violation of the interests of our country was impossible. The importance of the Aland Islands consists in their strategic jxisition in the Baltic Sea. The fortification of theAland Islands may be utilised for purposes hostile to the U.S.S.B..Being situated not far from the entrance to the Finnish Gulf thefortified Aland Islands may serve to close to the U.S.S.E. theentrances and exits to the Finnish Gulf. For this reason, now thatthe Finnish Government, together with Sweden, wish to carry out abig scheme of fortification of the Aland Islands, the Soviet Govern-ment made enquiries of the Finnish Government as to the object and
character of the proposed fortifications. Instead of meeting the verynatural wishes of the Soviet Union the Finnish Government refusedto give the requested information and explanations. The referencesmade in this connexion to military secrets are, as may be easilyunderstood, entirely unconvincing. The Finnish Government didnot mind communicating its plans of the fortification of the AlandIslands to another Government the Swedish Government. It notonly communicated its plans to this Government, but invited it toparticipate in putting into effect the whole of this plan of fortification.And yet, under the convention of 1921, Sweden enjoys no specialrights in this connexion. Moreover, the Soviet Union, which isinterested in the question of the fortification of the Aland Islands,is not only not a smaller State than Sweden, but a larger one.In consequence of the Finnish and Swedish Governments&apos; pro-posal the question of the revision of the convention of 1921 was discussed at the League Council which has just closed. Withoutthe CounciFs sanction this convention may not be revised, becausethe convention of the ten States was concluded on the basis of adecision of the League Council dated the 24th June, 1921. In viewof objections on the part of the representative of the Soviet Unionno unanimity, which was necessary for the decision of the league council, was possible. The results of the discussion in the league council are well known. The Council of the League did not ratify the proposal of Finland and Sweden. It did not give its sanction to the revision of the convention of 1921. One must assume that the Finnish Government will draw the necessary conclusions fromthis situation. In the light of recent international events the Alandquestion has acquired particularly serious significance for the soviet union. We do not consider it possible to become reconciled withthe toleration of any attempt to ignore the interests of the U.S.S.P.in this question, which is of great significance for the defence of our country.I will make quite a brief reference to questions in the Far Eastand to our relations with Japan.The greatest significance during this year was attached to our negotiations with Japan on the fishing question. As you know, inthe Primorye (the Far Eastern littoral province), in the Sea ofOkhotsk, on Saghalien and on Kamchatka, the Japanese have alarge number of fishing areas. At the end of last year 8S4 fishingareas were in their hands. The period of the convention, however,on the basis of which they had received these fishing areas hadalready expired. For many of the fishing areas the periods of leaseestablished at an earlier date had also expired. In this connexionthe Soviet Government entered into negotiations with Japan. Itwas stated on our part that, in view of strategical considerations, acertain number of areas, the leases of which had already expired,might not be granted in the future on lease to the Japanese. Inspite of the obvious justice of our position the Japanese offered greatresistance to the Soviet point of view.   As the result of lengthy
negotiations thirty-seven fishing areas were withdrawn from theJapanese and they were allotted ten new areas in other places. Theoperation of the convention was then extended for a further year.This agreement with Japan on the fisheries question is of great political significance, the more so as everything possible was done byreactionary circles in Japan to undermine the political aspect of thismatter. They did not even stop at all kinds of threats. TheJapanese reactionaries had another opportunity, however, of con-vincing themselves that threats in regard to the Soviet Union do notachieve their object (loud applause) and that the rights of the SovietState are firmly defended.   (Loud applause.)Now about frontier questions. It would seem to be time for thosewhom it concerns to understand that the Soviet Government will not tolerate any provocative acts on the part of Japano-Manchurianmilitary forces on its borders. It is necessary to recall this now inregard to the borders of the Mongolian National Republic as well.Under the agreement of mutual assistance existing between the(.S.S.R. and the Mongolian National Republic, we consider it our duty to render the Mongolian National Republic the necessary helpin the defence of its borders. Our attitude to such matters as a pact of mutual assistance signed by the Soviet Government is a serioustine. I think it necessary to utter a warning that the borders of theMongolian National Republic under the treaty of mutual assistanceconcluded between us will be defended by us with the same decision as our own frontiers. (Loud applause.) It is time that it shouldbe understood that the accusations of aggression against Japan putforward by Japan against the Government of the Mongolian NationalRepublic are laughable and nonsensical. It is also time to under-stand that there is a limit to all patience. (Applause.) It is there-fore better to give up while there is still time the continual repetition of provocative violation by the Japano-Manchurian military forces ofthe borders of the U.S.S.R. and the Mongolian National Republic.A suitable warning has been delivered through the japanese ambassador in Moscow.There is no necessity for me to speak of our relations with China.You are well aware of the statement of Comrade Stalin as regardssupport to people who have become the victims of aggression andwho are fighting for the independence of their Fatherland. this applies in full measme to China and the struggle of that countryfor national independence. We are consistently applying this policy.Tt is in agreement with the problem which faces Europe, namely,with the problem of creating a united front of peace-loving Powersagainst further development of aggression.   (Loud applause.)The U.S.S.R. now is not what it was say in 1921 when it wasonly beginning its peaceful creative work. It is necessary to recallthis, because, up to the present, some of our neighbours seem to be unable to understand this. (Laughter.) One must admit also thatthe U.S.S.R. is not what it was, say, but five or ten years ago, andthat the forces of the U.S.S.R. have grown.    (Applause.)    The
foreign policy of the Soviet Union should reflect the existence of changes in the international situation and the grown might of theU.S.S.R., which is a mighty factor for peace. It is unnecessary to prove that the foreign policy of the Soviet Union is deeply peaceful and directed against aggression. This is known best of all to theaggressive Powers themselves. (Cheers.) Some democratic states are coming to the realisation of this simple truth after great delay and hesitation. (Cheers.) And yet the Soviet Union cannot fail to take its place in the foremost ranks of the united front of peacefulStates who are really resisting aggression.No. 48.Sir IF. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, June 2, 1989.jtf. Molotov handed to the French Ambassador and myself this afternoon what he described as the text of the Anglo-French proposed agreement modified to meet the views of the Soviet government as follows :-&quot;The Governments of Great Britain, Franco and U.S.S.R..with the object of making more effective the principles of mutual assistance against aggression adopted by the League of Nations,have come to the following agreement: &quot; 1. France. England and U.S.S.R. undertake to render to each other immediately all effective assistance should one of these states become involved in hostilities with a European Power asa result either of (1) aggression by that Power against any oneof these three States; &quot;(2) aggression by that Power againstBelgium, Greece, Turkey, Roumania, Poland, Latvia, Estoniaand Finland, whom England. France and U.S.S.R. have agreedto defend against aggression: (3) assistance rendered by one ofthese three States to another European State which has requestedsuch assistance in order to resist violation of its neutrality.&quot;2. The three States will come to an agreement within the shortest possible time as to methods, forms and extent ofassistance which is to be rendered by them in conformity with paragraph 1.&quot;3. In the event of circumstances arising which, in theopinion of one of the contracting parties, create a threat of aggression by a European Power, the three States will immediately consult together to examine the situation and, incase of necessity, to establish in common the moment for putting into immediate effect mechanism of mutual assistance and manner of its application independently of any procedure applied by theLeague of Nations to examination of questions.
No. 19.Statement by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on-June 7. 1939.The Prime Minister: For reasons which the House will appreciate,it lias not been possible to give day-to-day information as to theprogress of the negotiations for an agreement between Great Britain.Prance and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. A stage has.however, now been reached which enables me to supplement thestatement which I made on the 24th May.*It appears from the last exchange of views with the SovietGovernment that there is general agreement as to the main objects[20469]s&quot;-I. The three States will communicate to each other the texts of all their engagements assumed in the spirit of theobligations provided for under paragraph 1 in respect of european states. If one of these States contemplates in the futurepossibility of assuming new obligations of a similar character, ilwill first consult the other two States and communicate to them the contents (text) of agreement.&quot; 5. In the event of commencement of joint operations against aggression in accordance with paragraph I, the threeStates undertake only to conclude an armistice or peace by jointagreement.&quot; 6. The present agreement enters into force simultaneously with agreement which is to be concluded in virtue of paragraph 2.&quot;7. The present agreement will continue in force for a periodof five years from this date. Not less than six months beforeexpiry of this period the three States will consider whether they wish to renew it with or without modification.-&apos;2. M. Molotov pointed out that, apart from consolidation ofour articles 1 and 2 into one article with that additional precisionwhich Soviet Government desired in regard to countries affected,main changes were (a) an attempt to deal with allusion to Leagueof Nations in accordance with assurances your Lordship had instructedme to give; (b) &quot;mission of our article 5* which the Soviet Govern-meiit considered unnecessary: and (o) insertion of provision (article 5)as regards conclusion of armistice or peace. He did not specificallymention new article 6. which is of considerable importance.3. I made no comment and merely said that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would give this text that friendly consideration whichthey were always ready to accord to the views of the Soviet(government.
to be attained. His Majesty&apos;s Government have, I think, been ableto satisfy the Soviet Government that they arc, in fact, prepared to conclude an agreement on the basis of full reciprocity. They havealso made it clear that they are ready, immediately and without any-reserve, to join with the French Government in giving the Union of soviet Socialist Republics full military support in the event of any act of aggression against her involving her in hostilities with a european Power. It is not intended that the military support whichthe three Powers would agree to extend to one another should be confined to a case of actual aggression upon their own territory. Itis possible to imagine various cases in which any one of the three governments might feel that its security was indirectly menaced bythe action of another European Power. These cases have been reviewed in detail, and I hope that it may he possible now to suggest a formula acceptable to the three Governments which, while havingregard to the rights and interests of other States, will assureco-operation between those Powers in resistance to aggression.There remain one or two difficulties to be resolved, in particular the position of certain States, which do not want to receive aguarantee on the ground that it would compromise the strictneutrality which they desire to preserve. It is manifestly impossibleto impose a guarantee on States which do not desire it, but I hopethat some means may be found by which this difficulty, and any others which may arise in the adjustment of the general points on whichthere is now no difference between the three Governments, shall not stand in the way of giving the greatest effect to the principle of mutual support against aggression.In order to accelerate the negotiations, it has been decided to send a representative of the Foreign Office to Moscow to convey to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador there full information as to the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government on all outstanding points. I hope that by this method it will be possible more rapidly to complete the discussion thatis still necessary to harmonise the views of the three governments and so to reach final agreement.Mr. Adams: Might I be allowed to thank the Prime Minister forthat full statement and also to ask him whether it is not true to saythat the final success of these negotiations will make defeat completelyimpossible and war itself unlikely?Mr. Greenwood: Will the Prime Minister explain who is likelyto go to Moscow and whether that visit will hinder the rapid conclusionof agreement on the principles of the treaty; whether the principlesof the treaty cannot be settled by the Governments and onlysubsidiary matters left to be settled in Moscow?The Prime Minister: I cannot say at the present time who will    ibe the representative of the Foreign Office, because that is still underconsideration.Mr. Ellis Smith : Could not it be a Minister?
No. 50.Viscount Halifax to Sir IF. Seeds (Moscow).Sir, Foreign Office, June 8, 1931).1 asked the Soviet Ambassador to call on me this morning inorder that I might explain to him the line of action which we werepursuing concerning the negotiations with his Government.The Prime Minister: The object of sending a representative ofthe Foreign Office to Moscow is to facilitate and accelerate the negotia-tions. and not to delay them. T have every hope that that may be theresult.Mr. Greenwood: Is it not possible that a visit to Moscow mightbe interpreted as a delaying operation against the fidl completion ofthe treaty? While the principle might be agreed to now. could notthe details be settled afterwards?The Prime Minister: We are not in a position actually to conclude a treaty now, because of the points I have mentioned which are still to be resolved. It is in the hope of resolving them rapidly that thisvisit is to take place.Mr. V. Adams: Can the Prime Minister say when the missionwill go to &quot;Moscow?77;e Prime Minister: At once.Mr. Mander: Will the proposed agreement include an arrange-mcnt for immediate staff conversations?77ie Prime Minister: 1 think we had better wait until we reach an agreement.Mr. Sandys: Is the Prime Minister aware that his hopefulstatement will be received as evidence of the Governments determina-tion to reach this agreement as quickly as possible?Mr. Cocks: Will the representative be a member of the Govern-ment, or a civil servant?The Prime Minister: A civil servant.Lieutenant-Commander Fletcher asked the Prime Minister, withreference to the Anglo-Franco-Russian negotiations, whether HisMajesty&apos;s Government have received any communication from theGovernments of the Baltic indicating their wish to be guaranteed, or,on the contrary, not to be guaranteed?The Prime Minister: His Majesty&apos;s Government have receivedseveral communications from the Finnish, Estonian and LatvianGovernments indicating that, in view of their intention to maintainstrict neutrality, they did not wish to receive a guarantee as a resultof the present negotiations between Great Britain, France and Russia.
2. I expressed the hope to M. Maisky that he would have thought the statement made by the Prime Minister yesterday helpful. Inthat statement we had made it plain how very far we were preparedto go to meet the wishes of the Soviet Government by making itclear that the guarantee we would be willing to extend to them on a reciprocal basis was not confined only to a direct attack upon Sovietterritory. M. Maisky recognised the importance of what had been said in the House of Commons yesterday and seemed on the wholefairly satisfied with it. adding, however, that he had never saidanything at Geneva which precluded his Government from pressingtheir claim on other points to which they attached importance.3. I told his Excellency that the principal matters in the draftsubmitted by M. Molotov* that caused us difficulty were, firstly, therecapitulation of States by name, irrespective of their own wishes inthe matter. Incidentally, the list that the Soviet Government had submitted showed how far we bad moved from the original conception of reciprocity. By this list we were to be bound to join Russia inthe event of attack upon any of her neighbours that might be held to threaten her security, whereas the same obligation was not to beundertaken by Russia in the case of Great Britain thinking hersecurity to be threatened by a German attack on other States not mentioned in the catalogue. M. Maisky admitted this, but said thatwe were, of course, fully entitled to raise such a point as this withhis Government, and gave me the impression that they would not lieunwilling to consider it. Secondly, we felt great difficulty about thearticle in M. Molotov&apos;s draft that made the conclusion of any agrce-meut dependent upon the conclusion of military conversations. This,we thought, tended to make dangerous delay. Lastly, I myself fellconsiderable difficulty about, the proposal of including at this stagean agreement, as suggested, in no case to make a separate armisticeor peace. I well understood the desirability of such a provision, if and when we were launched into war and were all agreed as to the aims we sought to achieve. It seemed to me that the appropriate moment at which to give such a common undertaking would be when a decision as to the purpose of the war was reached.4. I told M. Maisky that it had been our original intention toask your Excellency to come from Moscow so that we might explainour point of view on all points fully to you, in order that, on return,you could have asked M. Molotov to give you the opportunity otgoing through the draft point by point so as to save delay by furtherexchange of notes. You had, unfortunately, succumbed to influenza,and we had, therefore, been obliged to adopt the alternative of sending a representative of the Foreign Office to Moscow. I had atone time thought of suggesting to the Prime Minister that 1 should go myself, but it was really impossible to get away, and, moreover,I felt that this kind of business was better handled by Ambassadors.M. Maisky seemed to think this a very reasonable proposal and spoke
No. 51.Memorandum of Instructions taken to Moscow by Mr. Strangon -June 12. 1939.His Majesty&apos;s Government have examined the draft agreementcommunicated to the British and French Ambassadors on the-2nd ,Iune.*2. His Majesty&apos;s Government are glad to note that a substantial measure of agreement has now been reached as to the general linesof the proposed agreement.3.   It is agreed : (1) That a treaty should be concluded between the three Powerson an equal footing, in which each of the three would undertake similar obligations towards the other two.(2) That the three Powers would render each other immediate assistance (a) In the event of one of them being the object of a direct attack by a European Power.(b) In the event of one of the three Powers going to theassistance of certain States which it had undertaken to assist against aggression.(3) That the treaty should be in harmony with the principle of mutual assistance against aggression adopted by the Leagueof Nations, but that assistance should be given under thetreaty without if being necessary to await action by theLeague.f-i) That there should be immediate consultation between thethree States with a view to settling the methods, forms and extent of the assistance to he rendered under the treaty.(5) That in the event of a threat of aggression by a european power, there should he consultation between the three powers and, should the necessity arise, a decision by them as to the moment and manner of application of the mechanism of mutual assistance.in terms of warm appreciation of Mr. Strang&apos;s ability, if he was therepresentative of the Foreign Office to be selected, lie told me thatMr. Strang had been responsible with himself for drafting at thelime of Mr. Ederi&apos;s visit to Moscow, and said that he had considerablerespect for his powers in this direction.I am, c&amp;e.HALIFAX.
(6) That the three States should communicate to each other theterms of the undertakings given by them to other States,and consult each other before assuming further obligations.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government hope, therefore, that it will bepossible at an early date to settle the terms of a treaty based on these principles. The treaty should, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, be as short and simple in its terms as possible.5. There are, however, a number of points in the Soviet draffwhich causes His Majesty&apos;s Government some difficulty.G. The chief of these relates to the States in whose case the guarantees referred to in paragraph S (2) (b) above are to apply. by sub--paragraph 2 of article 1 of the Soviet draft it is provided thatthe three countries would undertake to render assistance to eachother should one of them become involved in hostilities with a european Power as the result of aggression by that Power against certain countries enumerated in the Soviet draft, whom the three countries would agree to defend against aggression. The countries mentioned in the Soviet draft are the five European countries towhom His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government havegiven undertakings, namely, Belgium, Greece, Turkey, Boumaniaand Poland, together with the three States on the north-west frontier of Soviet Russia, namely, Latvia, Estonia and Finland, who havenot received undertakings of assistance from Great Britain andFrance, nor, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware, fromthe Soviet Union.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government think it undesirable that thereshould be any specific enumeration in the text of the treaty of thecountries in whose defence the three Powers would collaborate. Thethree Baltic States, for example, are strongly opposed to being theobject of a guarantee, or. indeed, to being mentioned in the agree-menfc at all. The Estonian Foreign Minister, in a recent public state-ment, has said that if &quot;a Great Power desired to assume the role of our defender, either as representing the collective system or todefend its own vital interests in the Baltic, such a system would he considered as aggression, against which the Baltic States areprepared to fight with all their forces.&quot; The Latvian and FinnishGovernments take a similar view, and the Finnish Minister forForeign Affairs has specifically stated that such a guarantee couldnot be accepted. Then again, although Poland has entered intoreciprocal arrangements of mutual assistance with Great Britain andFrance, and although Belgium and Roumania, for example, havereceived undertakings of assistance from Great Britain and France,it is clear that, for reasons which His Majesty&apos;s Government feel bound to respect, these States would prefer not to be made thesubject of a treaty concluded by the three Great Powers. Indeed,the Roumanian Foreign Minister has expressly requested that thename of his country should not he mentioned in any agreement which may lie concluded by Great Britain, France and the soviet union.
8. But while His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to accept this proposal in the Soviet draft, since they cannot agree to impose a guarantee on Powers which are unwilling to receive it, they fullysympathise with the desire of the Soviet Government that themilitary support which the three Powers would agree to extend to one another should not be confined to a case of actual aggression upon their own territory. They have already met the desire of the SovietGovernment for a direct guarantee to cover the case of directaggression, and they have given much thought to the question how best to devise means of dealing with a threat to the security of the contracting Powers caused by action other than direct aggression.9. Part of this difficulty would be met if the treaty were toinclude a clause to the effect that the three Powers would undertaketo assist each other in the event of one of them becoming involvedin hostilities with a European Power as the result of aggression bythat Power against another European State which had, with its ownconsent, received an undertaking of assistance from the contractingcountry. It would be unnecessary to mention these States by namein the treaty, and by another article in the treaty it would be agreed,as indicated in paragraph 3 (6) above, that the three governments would communicate to each other the terms of any undertakings ofthis kind which they had given to other States.10. There woidd still remain, however, the case of aggression against or through States which have not received any such guarantee,some of whom have declared that they would refuse to receive aguarantee. His Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate, for example,that the military occupation of one of the Soviet Union&apos;s north-westneighbours, whose resistance might be quickly over-borne or who might even acquiesce in the occupation, might be regarded by theSoviet Union as a menace to the security of the Soviet Union. Asimilar situation in Holland or Switzerland would be a menace tofhe security of Great Britain and France. His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave been giving much thought to the question how best to meet sucha situation through common action by the three Powers, while atthe same time not forcing a direct guarantee on the States concerned,or provoking undesirable reactions on the part of their Governments.11. His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad if the Commissarfor Foreign Affairs would examine this question with His Majesty&apos;ambassador. His Majesty&apos;s Government are inclined to think thatthe best solution would be found by applying to this case theprocedure which they understand to be contemplated in article 8 ofM. Molotov&apos;s draft. They suggest accordingly that it should beagreed that the three Powers should immediately consult togetherif one of them considered that its security was menaced by a threat to the independence or neutrality of any other European Power.If the other two Powers agreed that such a menace existed, and ifthe contracting Power in question was involved in hostilities inconsequence, the other two Powers would go to its assistance.
7-212. The foregoing suggestions seem to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto cover the case of what might be called indirect aggression againslthe three contracting Towers through (a) other Powers who havealready received a guarantee from the contracting Powers (i.c,Belgium. Greece, Turkey, Eoumania and Poland); (h) other Powerswho have not received such a guarantee or do not wish to receiveit (Latvia, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands and Switzerland arethe most obvious examples). The proposed provisions would thustake the place of sub-paragraphs 2 and 3 in article I of M. Molotov&apos;draft.18. There are three further points arising out of M. Molotov&apos;draft to which His majesty&apos;s Government wish to refer: 14. Point I. In article 2 of M. Molotov&apos;s draft it is providedthat the three States will come to an agreement as soon as possibleas to the methods, forms and extent of the assistance to be rendered by them. In article G of that draft it is further provided that theproposed treaty&apos; is not to come into force until the conclusion ofthis proposed military agreement.15. His Majesty&apos;s Government entirely agree that there shouldbe immediate consultation between the three Governments as to themethods, forms and extent of the assistance, provided for in thetreaty, since this furnishes the best means of making sure that such assistance shall be as effective as possible. They will accordingly beprepared that these conversations should be inaugurated at the earliestpossible date and that they should be both frank and exhaustive.They doubt, however, whether it would be possible within anyreasonably brief period to reach a concrete military agreement tocover every possible contingency. They are anxious to conclude anagreement with the Soviet Government without any further delay,and they view with dismay the effect on the European situation whichwould be produced by the postponement of the entry into iovce ofany such agreement until the conclusion of a military agreement.They think that the only practical course would be to make it clear in the treaty itself that the three States would concert together,immediately after the conclusion of the treaty, with a view tosettling the methods, forms and extent of the assistance to herendered, and it might indeed be understood between the three parties that the staff contacts would be inaugurated within a specified time from the conclusion of the treaty.16. Point 2. Article 5 of M. Molotov&apos;s draft provides that thethree States will undertake only to conclude an armistice or peace by joint agreement. His Majesty&apos;s Government see serious objectionto such a provision. His Majesty&apos;s Government would of courseloyally carry out the obligations of any treaty into which they entered,and they would count on the other two parties to do the same. Batthey doubt whether on practical grounds this kind of provision wouldin fact achieve its object. An essential condition of an undertakingnot to conclude peace except on terms which had been jointlyagreed is that agreement should have been reached as to the objects
which the peace is to achieve, and no such agreement; is possible before the circumstances which produced the war are known. HisMajesfcy&apos;s Government would be prepared to consider some provision in this direction if agreement were reached on other points still outstanding.17. Point 3. There is one further point which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment desire to consider in consultation with the SovietGovernment; it is one rather of form than of substance. Tt will benoted that the drafts which His Majesty&apos;s Government and the SovietGovernment have been considering in the past have provided fora case in which the three contracting States become involved in hostilities with a &quot;European Power.&quot; Though they have of coursehad Germany in mind, no particular Power has been specified, norindeed is it desirable to do so. The texts which have hitherto beenunder consideration, however, raise one difficulty, which is that HisMajesty&apos;s Government and France will in effect be guaranteeingthe Soviet Union against, for example, Poland. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not propose to guarantee Poland against the soviet union, a course to which the Soviet Government have stated thatthey object, and His Majesty &apos;s Government think it highly understandable that the proposed treaty should be capable of beinginterpreted as involving a guarantee of the Soviet Union againstPoland. Moreover, inasmuch as both France and the United kingdom will have arrangements for mutual support with Poland, it would clearly be undesirable that the Soviet Union should appear to beguaranteeing them against that country. His Majesty&apos;s government wish to draw the attention of the Soviet Government to this point and would be glad to consider with the Soviet Government the best method of excluding such a guarantee from the scope of the proposed treaty, it being understood of course that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsguarantee would apply in the purely hypothetical case of Polandcombining with Germany to attack the Soviet Union.Foreign Office, June 12, 1939.No. 52.Anglo-French Draft Articles of June 6. 1939. used by Sir W.

The United Kingdom, France and the U.S.S.E. undertaketo give to each other immediately all the support and assistance in[20409] i
their power should one of these countries become involved in hostilities with a European Power as a result either of (1) Aggression by that Power against any one of these three countries.(2) Aggression by that Power against another European state which the contracting country concerned had, in conformitywith the wishes of that State, undertaken to assist against such aggression.(3) Action by that Power which the three contracting Govern-ments, as a result of the consultation between themprovided for in article 3, considered to threaten theindependence or neutrality of another European State insuch a way as to constitute a menace to the security of the contracting country concerned.Such support and assistance will be given in conformity with theprinciples of article 1G, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Covenant of theLeague of Nations, hut without its being necessary to await action by the League.2. The three States will immediately concert together as to themethods, forms and extent of the assistance to be rendered by themin conformity with article 1. with the object of making such assistance as effective as possible in case of need.3. Without prejudice to the immediate rendering of assistance on the outbreak of hostilities in accordance with article 1. in theevent of circumstances arising which threaten to call into operation the undertakings of mutual assistance contained in article 1. thethree contracting Governments will, on the request of any one ofthem, immediately consult together to examine the situation. Shouldthe necessity arise, they will decide by common agreement themoment at which the mechanism of mutual assistance shall be putinto operation and the manner of its application.4. The three Governments will communicate to each other theterms of any undertakings referred to in 1 (2) above which they havealready given. Any of them which may in future be considering the giving of such an undertaking will consult the other two governments before doing so, and will communicate to them the terms of any undertaking so given.5. It is understood that the rendering of support and assistancein the above cases is without prejudice to the rights and position ofother Powers.6. This agreement will continue for a period of [5] years from to-day&apos;s date. Not less than [6 months] before the expiry of the said period, the three Governments will consult together asto the desirability of renewing it. with or without modifications.
Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.My Lord, Moscow, June 20, 1939.I riAVE the honour to report that Mr. Strang arrived in Moscow(luring the morning of the 14th instant and handed me your Lord-ship^ instructions on the subject of the negotiations with the soviet union. After examining them with Mr. Strang I invited M. Naggiar,the French Ambassador, to come to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy for aconsultation the same evening. A further interview with M. Naggiartook place the next morning, the 15th, when he had had time toexamine your Lordship&apos;s memorandum of instructions, of which wehad given him a copy. To facilitate the conversations withM. Molotov and M. Potemkin, French translations of all the mostimportant portions of your Lordship&apos;s memorandum were prepared.We agreed that it was most important that the Soviet Governmentshould have the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in yourl.ordship&apos;s own words on paper, having i-egard to the misunder-standings inevitably to be expected from the cumbrous procedure ofa conversation in two languages.2. At 5 o&apos;clock the same afternoon M. Naggiar, Mr. Strangand myself proceeded to the Kremlin, where we were received byM. Molotov, with M. Potemkin as interpreter.3. I began the conversation, as provided for by your Lordship&apos;instructions, by stating the pleasure with which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment noted the great extent to which agreement had alreadybeen reached, as shown by the various points specified in para-graph 3 of your memorandum, which I proceeded to read. In mostcircumstances this should have formed a most promising gambitleading to an atmosphere of friendly understanding, but unfortunate-nately M. Molotov was inclined to fear an attempt at compromisingthe Soviet position, and to examine with some distrust whether myallegation that we were basing this declared measure of agreement on the Soviet Government&apos;s own proposals was justified by theRussian text. This led to an exchange of questions and answers,with repeated assurances on our side that we were only talking on general lines and were not formulating a text.4. I then proceeded to express the hope of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that it would now be possible to reach an agreement onthe whole question of a treaty with no undue delay, adding that sucha treaty should, in our view, be as short and simple as possible.There were, of course, a number of points in the Soviet draft* notably, articles 1 (2): 5 and 6 which caused His Majesty&apos;sGovernment some difficulty, and we proposed to examine these pointsround the table one by one. instead of the procedure hitherto followed
of telegraphing between London and Moscow complete drafts of atreaty.5. The most important point still at issue between us arose,I continued, out of sub-paragraph (2) of article 1 of the Soviet draftrelating to aggressive action against certain countries therein specified by name. His Majesty&apos;s Government thought it undesirable thatthere should be any such specific enumeration of the countries in whose defence the three signatory Powers would collaborate : I had discussed that point so fully in previous interviews with M. Molotovthat it was unnecessary for nie now to do more than remind him that the three Baltic States had strong objections not only toreceiving guarantees under the treaty, but also to being mentionedin the treaty at all. I would also point out that Poland andBoumania had made it quite clear especially the latter that theydid not wish to be cited in such a treaty.6. At this stage of the interview it became clear that in orderto facilitate translation of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthe best procedure would be for M. Potemkin to take our French text of the relevant portions of the memorandum of instructions4&quot; and totranslate orally direct therefrom. T therefore handed him the Frenchtranslation of paragraphs 8 to 12, inclusive, of the memorandum,but I made it clear that the English text (of which we also handed in a copy) was alone to he regarded as authoritative (copy enclosed.Enclosure I). I would add here that, to make the expression of our instructions complete, we subsequently gave M. Molotov the text of paragraphs 1 to S of the memorandum (copy enclosed, Enclosure 2).7. When M. Potemkin had finished, M. Molotov said that hewas disappointed at the tenor of our communication; he had expected from all he had seen in the British and French press thatwe would he the bearers of something much more positive and more in accordance with the views of the Soviet Government. We. inreturn, naturally deprecated undue reliance on unauthorised and ill-informed press comment, but M. Molotov said that his expectationshad been, in fact, based to a considerable extent on other than presssources.   He did not specify what these were.8. M. Molotov then put a series of questions with a view toelucidating the exact implications of the suggestion contained inparagraph 11 of the memorandum. I need not enter into detailsof this part of the conversation beyond stating that we made theintention and the effect of the proposal absolutely clear. Eventuallywe handed him the text of articles 1 and 8 of the draft agreementdated the 6th June.   I enclose copy herein (Enclosure 8).9. M. Molotov then proceeded to put a number of questions about the international background of these negotiations.10. His first question was whether His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the French Government would be prepared to guarantee Finland.Estonia and Latvia if these three countries were willing to receive
a guarantee. M. Naggiar and I replied that we had no instructions on this point; we had to deal with the situation as we found it, andthe present attitude of these three Baltic States was well known.11. M. Molotov asked how we thought the Polish Govern-ment would regard our present proposals. We told him that His Majesty&apos;s Government had understood, after enquiry in Warsaw, that the Polish Government would not be likelyto raise objection to the system foreshadowed in the Anglo-French draft of the 25th May.&apos; and that the general ideaof our present draft was the same as that of the earlier draft.We could not recall whether similar enquiries had been made in theBaltic capitals. He then reverted to the attitude of the three baltic states, and suggested that their respective views were by no meansidentical; the Latvian Foreign Minister had. for example, carefullyrefrained from associating himself with the violent statementsrecently made by the Finnish and Estonian Foreign Ministers. Thedrift of his remarks was that, since there, were already shades of difference in the attitudes of the three Governments, the three governments might be brought in time to change their views. Wesaid that, if there were shades of difference, the attitude of the three countries was still that they did not wish to be mentioned in theproposed treaty or to be made the object of a guarantee without their consent.12. He then asked whether, in the guarantees which we had given to other States (Belgium, Greece, Poland. Boumania and turkey), we had made provision for joint assistance to third States.We gave him an outline of the arrangements so far made with thosecountries. He asked whether our arrangement with Poland dealtwith the case of an attack on Lithuania. We repeated to him whatthe Polish Ambassador in London had said to the Soviet ambassador on this point, namely, that when the Anglo-Polish declaration spoke of an indirect threat to the independence of Poland, what the twoGovernments had had in mind was possible action against Danzig,which was not, of course, Polish territory. The question of assistanceto Lithuania had not been discussed with M. Beck. He then saidthat he understood that Poland would help Great Britain in the eventof an attack on the Netherlands. Was this so:&apos; Mr. Strang confinedhimself to saying that the question of dealing with an indirect threat to either country would no doubt have to be discussed during the negotiation of the formal treaty foreshadowed in the Anglo-Polishdeclaration, but that nothing definite had yet been settled.13. It was somewhat irritating to be interrogated in this way,hut we thought it well to reply as fully as we could, in order to convince M. Molotov of our frankness, and because His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would in any event be obliged in due course,by the treaty itself, to inform the Soviet Government fully of theterms of their guarantees to other States.   I would add that the
entire burden of this part of the interview was borne by Mr. Strangalone, and I wish to put on record my appreciation of the skill anddiscretion with which he reinforced his knowledge and grasp of thevarious points involved.14. I had thought of confining the interview to this question ofthe guarantees and other States, but M. Molotov expressed his desireto learn the views of Ilis Majesty&apos;s Government on all other debatablepoints. We consequently read out to him, as before, a Frenchrendering of paragraphs 14 to 16 inclusive of the memorandum of instructions, and left with him a copy of the English text (copyenclosed Enclosures 1 and 5). Paragraph 17 of the memorandum was only put verbally as a point of purely juristic or technical nature.M. Molotov asked a few questions but made no particular comment.Finally, he said he would study the material supplied to him andwould summon us to another meeting in due course.15. The next day, the 10th June, we were again summoned lothe Kremlin, and M. Molotov handed us. in Russian, the text of theSoviet reply, of which I have the honour to enclose a translation(Enclosure 01. My telegram of the 16th June* contained so full asummary of the conversation that 1 hope 1 may he excused fromrepeating it now. But in view of the last sentence in paragraph 2of your Lordship&apos;s telegram of the 19th June,! I would like to statethat, amongst the points made by Mr. Strang, the argument thatour guarantees to Poland and Roumania constitute a substantialprotection to the Soviet Union, was most clearly brought out.16. On the other hand, when we brought up the question ofissuing communiques to the press (on the line that whereas our twoembassies had maintained absolute silence here we had been somewhat surprised by a &quot;Tass&quot; communique stating that theimpression produced in Soviet circles by the previous conversationhad not been entirely satisfactory), M. Molotov had his own quitelegitimate grievance in this matter of atmosphere. He pointed outthat the Soviet Government had been continually shot at for weekspast by British and French journalists and also by parliamentaryquestioners, but that a remarkable reticence had on the whole been shown by Soviet organs of publicity. My French colleague and Iare of opinion that, in fact, our interests have even more suffered from the publicity in question, but M. Molotov was technically in theright. We confined ourselves to repeating that we would continue to abstain from giving any impressions to journalists; and we wereglad to note next day that the Soviet press published nothing beyondthe hare announcement that a meeting had taken place.17. Finally. I would pay tribute to the valuable assistancerendered by the French Ambassador in both these conversations.His clear and logical mind, together with his ability to sum up a situation or a problem in concise and limpid terms, helped on manyan  occasion to dispel the mist of understanding and suspicion.
Enclosure 1 in No. 58.Observations on Article 1 (2) of the Soviet Draft.(Paragraphs 8-12 of the Memorandum of Instructions.)While His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to accept theproposal in article 1 (2) of the Soviet draft, since they cannot agreeto impose a guarantee on Powers which are unwilling to receive it,they fully sympathise with the desire of the Soviet Government thatthe military support which the three Powers would agree to extend to one another should not be confined to a case of actual aggressionupon their own territory. They have already met the desire of theSoviet Government for a direct guarantee to cover the case of directaggression, and they have given much thought to the question how best to devise means of dealing with a threat to the security of the contracting Powers caused by action other than direct aggression.2. Part of this difficulty would be met if the treaty were toinclude a clause to the effect that the three Powers would undertaketo assist each other in the event of one of them becoming involvedin hostilities with a European Power as the result of aggression bythat Power against another European State which had, with its ownconsent, received an undertaking of assistance from the contractingcountry. It would be unnecessary to mention these States by namein the treaty, and by another article in the treaty it would he agreed,as indicated in article 4 of the Soviet draft, that the three Govern-ments would communicate to each other the terms of anyundertakings of this kind which they had given to other States.3. There would still remain, however, the case of aggression against or through States which have not received any such guarantee,some of whom have declared that they would refuse to receive aguarantee. His Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate, for example,that the military occupation of one of the Soviet Union&apos;s north-westneighbours, whose resistance might be quickly overborne or who might even acquiesce in the occupation, might be regarded by theSoviet Union as a menace to the security of the Soviet Union.A similar situation in Holland or Switzerland would be a menace tothe security of Great Britain and France. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have been giving much thought to the question how best toI should add that M. Naggiar took occasion to lay stress on the earnest desire of his Government to bring the negotiations to an early and successful conclusion.I have, &amp;e.WILLIAM SEEDS.
meet such a situation through common action by the three Powers,while at the same lime not forcing a direct guarantee on the states concerned, or provoking undesirable reactions on the part of their governments.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad if the Commissarfor Foreign Affairs would examine this question with His Majesty&apos;ambassador. His Majesty&apos;s Government are inclined to think thatthe best solution would be found by applying to this case theprocedure which they understand to lie contemplated in article 8 ofM. Molotov&apos;s draft. They suggest accordingly that it should beagreed that the three Powers should immediately consult together if one of them considered that its security was menaced by a threat to the independence or neutrality of any other European Power. Ifthe other two Powers agreed that such a menace existed, and if the contracting Power in question was involved in hostilities inconsequence, the other two Powers would go to its assistance.5. The foregoing suggestions seem to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto cover the case of what might be called indirect aggression againstthe three contracting Powers through (a) other Powers who havealready received a guarantee from one or other of the contractingPowers (i.c, Belgium, Greece, Turkey, Roumania and Poland):(b) other Powers who have not received such a guarantee or do not wish to receive it (Latvia, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands and switzerland are the most obvious examples). The proposed provisions would thus take the place of sub-paragraphs 2 and 8 in article 1 ofM. Molotov&apos;s draft.Enclosure 2 in No. 58.Points on which there is Agreement.(Paragraphs 1-3 of the Memorandum of Instructions.)His Majesty&apos;s Government have examined the draft agreementcommunicated to the British and French Ambassadors on the2nd June.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government are glad to note that a substantial measure of agreement has now been reached as to the general linesof the proposed agreement.3.   It is agreed : (1) That a treaty should be concluded between the three Powerson an equal footing, in which each of the three would undertake similar obligations towards the other two.
(2) That the three Powers would render each other immediate assistance (a) In the event of one of them being the object of a direct attack by a European Power.(b) In the event of one of the three Powers going to theassistance of certain European States which it had undertaken to assist against aggression.(3) That the treaty should be in harmony with the principle of mutual assistance against aggression adopted by the Leagueof Nations, but that assistance should be given under thetreaty without it being necessary to await action by theLeague.(4) That there should be immediate consultation between thethree States with a view to settling the methods, forms and extent of the assistance to be rendered under the treaty.(5) That, in the event of a threat of aggression by a european power, there should be consultation between the three powers, and, should the necessity arise, a decision by them as to the moment and manner of application of the mechanism of mutual assistance.(6) That the three States should communicate to each other theterms of the undertakings given by them to other States,and consult each other before assuming further obligations.Enclosure 8 in No. 58.Anf/Jo-French Draft of June 6, 1989.Article 1.The United Kingdom, France and the U.S.S.K. undertake to give to each other immediately all the support and assistance in their power should one of these countries become involved in hostilities with a European Power as a result either of (1) Aggression by that Power against any one of these three countries.(2) Aggression by that Power against another European state which the contracting country concerned had, in conformitywith the wishes of that State, undertaken to assist against such aggression.(8) Action by that Power which the three contracting Govern-ments, as a result of the consultation between themprovided for in article 3, considered to threaten theindependence or neutrality of another European State insuch a way as to constitute a menace to the security of the contracting country concerned.[20469] sc
8-2Such support and assistance will be given in conformity with theprinciples of article lfi, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Covenant of theLeague of Nations, but without its being necessary to await action by the League.Article 8.Without prejudice to the immediate rendering of assistance on theoutbreak of hostilities in accordance with article 1, in the eventof circumstances arising which threaten to call into operation the undertakings of mutual assistance contained in article 1, the threecontracting Governments will, on the request of any one of them,immediately consult together to examine the situation. Should thenecessity arise, they will decide by common agreement the nionieirat which the mechanism of mutual assistance shall be put intooperation and the manner of its application.Enclosure 4 in No. 53.Observation!; on Articles 2 and (3 of the Soviet Draft.(Paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Memorandum of Instructions.)In article 2 of M. Molotov&apos;s draft it is provided that the threeStates will come to an agreement as soon as possible as to themethods, forms and extent of the assistance to be rendered by them.In article 6 of that draft it is further provided that the proposed treaty is not to come into force until the conclusion of this proposedmilitary agreement.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government entirely agree that there shouldbe immediate consultation between the three Governments as to themethods, forms and extent of the assistance, provided for in thetreaty, since this furnishes the best means of making sure that such assistance shall he as effective as possible. They will accordingly beprepared that these conversations should be inaugurated at theearliest possible date and that they should be both frank andexhaustive. They doubt, however, whether it would be possible within any reasonably brief period to reach a concrete military agreement tocover every possible contingency. They are anxious to conclude anagreement with the Soviet Government without any further delay,and they view with dismay the effect on the European situation whichwould be produced by the postponement of the entry into force ofany such agreement until the conclusion of a military agreement.They think that the only practical course would be to make it clear in the treaty itself that the three States would concert together.immediately7 after the conclusion of the treaty, with a view to settling
Enclosure 5 in No. 53.Observation on Article 5 of the Soviet Draft.(Paragraph 16 of the Memorandum of Instructions.)Article 5 of M. Molotov&apos;s draft provides that the three states will undertake only to conclude an armistice or peace by jointagreement. His Majesty&apos;s Government see serious objection to sucha provision. His Majesty&apos;s Government would, of course, loyallycarry out the obligations of any treaty into which they entered, andthey would count on the other two parties to do the same. But theydoubt whether on practical grounds this kind of provision would, infact, achieve its object. An essential condition of an undertaking notto conclude peace except on terms which had been jointly agreed isthat agreement should have been reached as to the objects which thepeace is to achieve, and no such agreement is possible before thecircumstances vyhich produced the war are known. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared to consider some provision in thisdirection if agreement were reached on other points still outstanding.Enclosure 6 in No. 53.Translation of Soviet Reply of June 16, 1939.Having acquainted themselves with the Anglo-French formulashanded to Molotov on the 15th June, the Government of the soviet union have come to the following conclusion : 1. As regards paragraph 1 of article 1 (Soviet Governmentsdraft*), the attitude of the Soviet Government coincides with that ofthe English and French Governments.2. As regards paragraph 2 of article 1 (Soviet Governmentsdraft), the views of the Soviet Government are rejected by the english and French Governments.The latter consider that the Soviet Union should render immediate assistance to Poland, roumania, Belgium, Greece and Turkey in thethe methods, forms and extent of the assistance to be rendered, andit might, indeed, be understood between the three parties that thestaff contacts would be inaugurated within a specified time from theconclusion of the treaty.
event of an attack on them by an aggressor and in the event ofEngland and France being involved in hostilities in connexiontherewith, whereas England and France would not assume obligations to render immediate assistance to the Soviet Union in the event ofthe U.S.S.R. being involved in hostilities with an aggressor inconnexion with an attack by the latter on Latvia, Estonia and finland, which border on the U.S.S.R.The Soviet Government cannot possibly agree to this inasmuch as they are unable to reconcile themselves to the position ofinequality, humiliating for the Soviet Union, in which the soviet union would thereby be placed.The Anglo-French proposals justify their refusal to guaranteeEstonia, Latvia and Finland by the unwillingness of these countries to accept such a guarantee. If this argument is insurmountable, andif the Soviet Government, as already mentioned above, are unableto participate in assistance to Poland, Boumania, Belgium, greece and Turkey without the receipt of equivalent assistance in the defenceof Estonia, Latvia and Finland from an aggressor, the Soviet Govern-ment are compelled to recognise that the whole question of a tripleguarantee to all the eight States above-named, as well as the questionforming the subject of paragraph 3 of article 1, will have to be postponed as not being ripe for solution, and that paragraphs 2 and 8of article 1 will have to be excluded from the agreement.In this event article 1 would only consist of paragraph 1, and theobligations of England. France and the U.S.S.B. as regards mutual assistance would enter into force only in the case of direct attack byan aggressor on the territory of one or other of the contractingparties, but they would not extend to cases in which one of the contracting parties might be involved in hostilities as the result of having rendered assistance to any third Bower which was not a partyto the present agreement, but which was the object of an attack byan aggressor. In this connexion the drafting of paragraph 1 ofarticle 1 would clearly have to be altered accordingly.8. In view of the existence of differences of opinion, further discussion is necessary on the question of the simultaneous entry intoforce of the general agreement and the military agreement.4. As regards the question of not concluding an armistice orpeace except by general agreement, the Soviet Government maintain their attitude, inasmuch as they are unable to contemplate that anyof the contracting parties should have the right, at the very heigh&apos;of defensive military operations against an aggressor, to conclude aseparate agreement with the aggressor behind the back of and against it allies.5. The Soviet Government consider the reference to article 16,paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Covenant of the League of Nations to besuperfluous.
$no. 54.Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, June 16, 1989.M. Molotov asked French Ambassador, myself and Mr. Stranglo see him again this afternoon. Meeting lasted an hour and a half.He handed us a paper containing the Soviet Governments reply tothe representations we made to him yesterday. M. Potemkin madefor us an oral translation into French of M. Molotov&apos;s paper.2. An English translation is contained in my immediately following telegram.*8. M. Molotov then went, on to say that the three governments had several times tried to study in its widest aspect the question of proposed treaty. On each occasion the same difficulty had arisen andone of the Soviet conditions had been set aside. If His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the French Government treated the Soviet Govem-inent as being naive or foolish people, he himself could afford tosmile, but he could not guarantee that everyone would take so calma view. Soviet Government had given an affirmative reply tosuggestion of British and French Governments that they should undertake obligations in respect of the five guaranteed countries.Since then Great Britain and France had added Switzerland and netherlands. When, however, the Soviet Government asked for similar guarantees from Great Britain and France in respect of thethree border States which were weak and in need of assistance, theywere met by a categorical refusal. This proposal would place SovietGovernment in a humiliating position and they could not accept it.If the three Baltic States concerned did not want a Soviet guarantee,the Soviet Government were ready to postpone, as not being ripe for settlement, the whole question of assistance in respect of theStates other than the three signatories. Soviet Government were ready to undertake obligations in respect of other States in whichthey had only a minor interest provided that the required guaranteescould be secured for the Baltic States. As the Soviet ambassador had observed to your Lordship, this was a sine qua non. It was clear from proposals that we had made that this question was not settled and that therefore it had better be postponed.4. French Ambassador asked whether he could sum up theattitude of the Soviet Government as being that, if the two western powers could not create a system of guarantees which would be identical for the three Baltic States on the one hand and for theother five States on the other, the Soviet Government would prefer to postpone the whole question of guarantees in respect of non-signatory States and to confine treaty to an arrangement of mutual assistance among the three signatories to operate in the event of direct aggression upon them.   M. Molotov said that this was so.

M. Molotov said that this was so.
5. We asked him whether in this limited treaty it would be theintention to include such of the articles in the existing drafts as were still relevant. M. Molotov assented, but said that the question would, of course, have to be considered in detail if the time came.6. We asked him whether, in the event of the scope of theproposed arrangement being limited in this way, the Soviet Govern-ment would contemplate the same kind of procedure as had beenadopted in our conversations with Poland and Turkey, namely,negotiation of a preliminary declaration, to be followed by negotiation of a formal treaty. M. Molotov did not welcome this idea and saidthat the immediate negotiation of a formal treaty would be preferable.7. French Ambassador observed it was not enough to speak ofthe three Baltic States and five guaranteed States. Netherlands and switzerland were just as important for Great Britain and France asthe Baltic States for Soviet Russia.8. We pointed out as matter of form that the statement aboutthe Anglo-French proposals at the beginning of second sub-paragraphof paragraph 2 of M. Molotov&apos;s paper&quot; was inaccurate, since HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the French Government had not suggestedthat the Soviet Government should render assistance to Poland andto other guaranteed States, but that the Soviet Union should render assistance to Great Britain and France if they became involved in hostilities on behalf of these States.9. In view of thoroughness with which we had threshed outthe whole question yesterday, we did not think it worth trying to argue M. Molotov out of his position, especially as it wras socategorically stated.10. At one stage in the conversation M. Molotov reverted to thepoint about Poland dealt with in last paragraph of your memorandumof instructions. He seemed to take it amiss that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not be prepared in proposed treaty to support theU.S.S.R. against, for example, Poland; though at the same time he expressed surprise that possibility of an attack by Poland against theSoviet Union should even be thought conceivable, since in the sametreaty the Soviet Government would be required to give a guarantee of assistance in respect of Poland. To his mind this purely technical point which we had raised apparently had sinister implications, themore so since, as he pointed out, Poland and Roumania were bound by a treaty which was directed against the Soviet Union.* Enclosure 6 in No. 53.No. 55.Viscount Halifax to Sir IF. Seeds (Moscow).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, June 19, 1939.Your telegram of 16th June.*To judge from the text of M. Molotov&apos;s aide-memoire and of his remarks reported in your telegram of 16th June, it would seem that
M. Molotov has not realised the extent to which we intended in our last draft to go in the direction of meeting the Soviet Governmenfswish that we would come to their assistance in the event of their security being threatened by aggression against any of the Baltic-States. I had hoped that our intentions in this respect had been made clear in paragraphs 8. 10, 11 and 12 of instructions brought to youby Mr. Strang.* When M. Molotov states in his aide-memoire that britain and France would not assume obligation to render assistanceto the Soviet Government in the event of their being involved in hostilities with an aggressor in connexion with an attack by the latteron one of the Baltic States, he appears to overlook completely the factthat our draft treaty was intended to provide precisely for this assistance if Russian security were menaced as a result of suchaggression on a Baltic State.2. Nor is it true that our proposals involve placing the SovietGovernment in a position of inequality. The neighbouring countries whose integrity is important from the point of view of Russian security-are Poland, Roumania and the Baltic States; in the case of Franceand ourselves the corresponding countries are Belgium, Holland and switzerland. Under our proposals the cases of Poland and Roumaniaon the one side and Belgium on the other would be covered by theprovision relating to countries which had received a guarantee. TheBaltic States on the one side and Holland and Switzerland on theother would be covered by the provision in 1 (8) of our text of6th June.t There would be, therefore, complete equality of treatment,aiid the Soviet Union would receive the same assurances in respectof the Baltic States as would content us in the case of Holland and switzerland. M. Molotov does not seem to appreciate that ourguarantees to Poland and Roumania are, in effect, a substantialprotection to the Soviet Union.3. In fact, we are perfectly willing to meet the preoccupations ofthe Soviet Government about the Baltic States provided that this is done in a way which does not involve naming them or thrusting upon them a guarantee which would be highly distasteful to them. It is because the only proposal which the Soviet Government have so farmade is patently open to this objection that we are unable to accept it; but it does not follow that the result which the Soviet government desire cannot be achieved in another way.4. Although I do not want to involve you in fruitless argumen-tation with M. Molotov, our position, as stated above, should be fully-understood by him, and unless you are satisfied that you have doneall that is possible in this direction already, I would be glad if you would set forth the position to him on the lines I have indicated. Inany case yTou should impress upon M. Molotov that, in raising objec-tions to his original draft, we are not trying to avoid dealing withpoints the importance of which for Russia we fully realise, and that,on the contrary, we are anxious to find a form of w7ords which willremove his doubts, while at the same time taking account of the
susceptibilities of the Baltic States, Holland and Switzerland. Weshould have hoped that, after the exhaustive exchange of views, our respective positions were now sufficiently clarified to enable the two sides to proceed to the stage of putting into words the agreement which already exists in principle. In order, therefore, to lose nofurther time, you should try to bring M. Molotov to the point of discussing with you and your French colleague what form of wordswould meet his difficulties.5. I have considered the suggestion contained in M. Molotov&apos;?aide-memoire to the effect that the whole question of guarantees inrespect of non-signatory States should be postponed, and that the tripartite Treaty between Great Britain. France and Russia should be confined to the case of direct attack by an aggressor on the territory of one of the three contracting parties. Such a treaty would, however,be a reversal of the idea with which we started out, which was toprotect Poland and other States who might find themselves in immediate danger of aggression and would, in airy case, be quite inadequate in present circumstances. I would not, therefore, beprepared to consider it except in the last resort. Incidentally, theeffect of such a limited treaty would be that the Soviet Governmentwould obtain the benefit of the guarantees we have given to roumania and Poland without Great Britain and France receiving any reciprocalbenefit on their side.(i. I attach the greatest importance to early and rapid progress,and as regards the subsidiary points mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 5,*I would be prepared, in return for a prompt and satisfactory setfle-ment, to agree (1) that staff conversations should start immediately on the signature of the agreement: (2) to the omission of the referenceto the Covenant of the League in article 1 of 6th June draft.! 1should also be ready to omit article 5 regarding rights and position ofother Powers.* See paragraphs 3 and 5 of enclosure 6 to No. 53. t No. 52No. 56.Sir IF. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, June 21, 1939.Your telegram of 19th June..&apos;We had another meeting with M. Molotov this afternoon, whichlasted for two hours.2. Although we felt that we had fully explained the views of thetwo Governments to M. Molotov, we thought it well to repeat themain points to him. We accordingly prepared a statement based onarguments contained in your telegram under reference, and this wastranslated orally by M. Potemkin to M. Molotov, and a copy of itwas left with him.  We then presented new draft of article l.t
8. We said, as regards the subsidiary points mentioned inparagraphs 8 and 4 of the Soviet, reply of the 16th June,&quot; that we agreed that further discussion was necessary on the question of staff conversations, and that we did not expect there would be any difficultyin coining to an agreement on the question of not concluding aseparate peace.4. M. Potemkin at once asked, with reference to paragraph 1of our new draft of article 1, with whom would lie the decision on thequestion whether or not aggression on European State, constituted a menace to the security of one of the contracting parties. To this wereplied that nothing was said in our draft on this point. One coursewould he to leave the point undefined, another would be to try to find some definition. We asked whether M. Molotov had any views as!o these alternatives.   To this question we received no reply.5. During the discussion we explained that the form of words in the second part of paragraph 1 of the new article 1 was designedio meet the views of the Soviet Government while at the same timeavoiding an enumeration of other States and taking account of theirsusceptibilities. In spite of existing difficulties we thought that away could be found to conclude a useful treaty, and it might well bethat if the three Powers could reach an agreement such as we nowproposed, the States which were now hesitating might in time come in take a more positive attitude towards the arrangement reached bythe three Powers.6. M. Molotov said that he thought the Soviet Government mustinsist on the inclusion in the treaty of the names of the eight countries concerned, and we understood him also to say that the Soviet Govern-ment still maintained the view that all three signatories should under-take to defend these eight countries. If it was not possible to mention the names and if these countries could not take up a more positive attitude it would be more logical to adopt the plan suggestedin Soviet reply of the 16th June, namely, to conclude a treatyproviding for direct aggression against the signatories only. He asked what view the British and French Governments took of that proposal. We told him that the two Governments would prefer to conclude a treaty on lines which they had already suggested, ratherthan a treaty of more limited scope.7. M. Molotov said that the obligations we had asked the SovietGovernment to assume in respect of the five guaranteed countries were very heavy. That being so it was essential that the guarantees which the Soviet Government would receive in return should be precisely stated and not left vague as in our draft.8. The French Ambassador asked, as a personal suggestion,whether it would meet the Soviet view if the names of the countries concerned could be communicated in a separate document which neednot be published. M. Molotov said that this point might bediscussed. He asked what view I took of it. I said that the question might be looked into.* Enclosure 6 in No. 53.[20469] N
9. French Ambassador enquired whether instead of enumeratingthe States it would be possible to name certain geographical areas.M. Molotov did not think this was a very useful suggestion.10. Finally, M. Molotov said that in his personal view theproposal we had made did not represent any progress. He would,however, submit it to the Soviet Government and let us have then-reply. We said that we should be glad to see any counter-draft thatthe Soviet Government might wish to suggest. His only responsewas to reply that the proposals of the Soviet Government had alreadybeen embodied in the drafts already submitted to us.No. 57.Anglo-French Redraft of Article 1 handed to M.

Enclosure in No. 58.(Translation.)Text of Observations made to M. Molotov by His Majesty&apos;ambassador and the French Ambassador at Moscow on June 21,1939.The British and French Governments have carefully examined the reply handed by M. Molotov on the Kith June* to the Ambas-sadors of France and Great Britain. They appreciated the franknesswith which the Soviet Government have expressed their point of view.2. There are certain points in this reply which, in the opinionof the two Governments, would seem to call for rectification.3. In particular, certain remarks in the second section ofparagraph 2 of the Soviet reply of the .16th June do not take accountof the exact terms of articles 1 and 3 of the plan submitted on the15th June for the consideration of the Soviet Government.t these articles provide that France, Great Britain and the IJ.S.S.R. pledgethemselves to give, in accordance with the conditions laid down bythese articles, mutual assistance to each other, and not, as M. Molotovseems to believe, to the third Power which has been attacked.4. Nor is it correct to say that the British and French Govern-ments do not desire to contract an engagement to lend immediate assistance to the Soviet Government, were the U.S.S.R. to find itselfengaged in hostilities with an aggressor as the result of an attack by this aggressor against Lithuania, Estonia or Finland. On thecontrary, the purpose of the draft article handed on the 15th june to M. Molotov is expressly to provide for tins assistance as a resultof such an aggression upon the Baltic States.5. There is therefore no doubt that the three Governments are completely in agreement as to the necessity of concluding a treaty on the basis of complete equality between the three contractingparties.6. In this respect the two Governments wish to draw attentionto the following considerations : Taking into account the point of view of the Soviet Govern-ment and the geographical situation, the neighbouring european countries whose integrity constitutes one of the elements of security of the TJ.S.S.R. are, if the opinion of the two Govern-ments is correct, the Baltic States, Poland and Roumania. Asfar as France and Great Britain are concerned, the neighbouringEuropean countries which have the same importance for thesecurity of these two States as the other five have for that ofRussia, are Belgium, Holland and Switzerland. According tothe suggestions made on the 15th June by the French and british governments, the cases of Poland and Roumania on the onehand and that of Belgium on the other were covered by theconditions of paragraph 2 of article 1 relating to the countries* Enclosure 6 in No. 53.t Enclosure 3 in No. 53.
which have received a promise of assistance from one of the threecontracting parties. Again, according to these Franco-british proposals, the cases of the Baltic Slates on the one hand and of holland and Switzerland on the other were covered by theconditions of paragraph 8 of the same article 1. Thus, whenconsiderations of proximity are taken into account, the conditions laid clown on the subject of the Baltic States do not differ fromthose applicable to Switzerland and Holland.7. But the French and British Governments, having alwaysdesired to give the Soviet Government satisfaction on the subjectof the Baltic States, have given careful consideration to the necessityfor doing this in a way which takes account of the present political conditions. These conditions are not, however, peculiar to the baltic states, but apply equally to the case of Holland and Switzerland, themaintenance of the independence of these countries being in equalmeasure for one or other of the three contracting parties animportant element in their security.8. In the light of the above considerations, the two governments have examined the draft article 1 laid before M. Molotov on the15th June and have prepared a new draft which the two Ambassador?would be glad to have the opportunity of discussing with him.No. 59.Sir IF. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscoir, June 22. 1939.My telegram of 21st June.*M. Molotov sent for us this afternoon to give us the reply of theSoviet Government to the proposals made to them in accordancewith your instructions.2.   Reply is in the following terms : &quot; The Soviet Government have attentively examined theproposals of England and France handed to M. Molotov on the21st June. In view of the fact that these proposals constitute a repetition of the previous proposals made by England andFrance, which, as already stated, have met with serious objectionson the part of the Soviet Government, the latter have come tothe conclusion that these proposals must be rejected as unacceptable.&quot;8. We asked him whether he could give us any indication as to how the draft of article 1, submitted by the Soviet Government onthe 2nd June,t which dealt with the fundamental point at issue, mightbe amended to meet our point of view.   He replied that as His
Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government had noiaccepted the proposal made by Soviet Government on the 16th June*(conclusion of limited treaty), the Soviet Government reverted to(heir proposal of the 2nd june and maintained it.4. We asked whether proposal of the 2nd June meant not only that there should be an enumeration of guaranteed States in thetreaty itself, but also thai treaty should provide for a commonguarantee by the three signatories of the eight States mentioned in soviet draft. M. Molotov replied that this was what the SovietGovernment had proposed, and that this was what they insisted upon.5. We asked whether the text of article 1 of their draft of the2nd June was to be regarded as ne varictur. He replied that it hadbeen submitted to the two Governments for discussion.6. We asked whether, pending settlement of fundamentalquestion of article 1. we might proceed to settle the text of the other articles, which were unlikely to cause any difficulty. M. Molotov said it would be better to settle- the main question first.* Enclosure 6 in No. 53. t No. 48.No. 60.Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscow).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, June 22, 1939.Your telegram of 21st June.*1. You are doubtless as bewildered as I am by the attitude ofM. Molotov. The position as I see it is that we have declared our-selves ready to give him the substance of everything he requires,namely, a guarantee to come to the assistance of Russia should shebe involved in hostilities owing to an act of aggression by germany on any of the Baltic States. As regards the form, we have demurredto mentioning the Baltic Slates by name on the practical ground thatthese States do not wish it, and that their declarations show that, ifwe disregard their wishes, we shall alienate them and possibly even(hive them into the arms of Germany. This eventuality is clearly in the interests neither of ourselves, nor, indeed, of Russia. It isconsequently not apparent why M. Molotov clings with such stubbornpertinacity to his original draft, in which the various States concernedarc mentioned.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government remain ready to meet the wishes of the Soviet Government fully so far as substance is concerned, butfor the practical reason given above, they consider it against thejoint interest of the contracting parties that mention should be madein the agreement itself of those States, namely, the Baltic States,Holland and Switzerland, which do not wish to receive a publicguarantee.
8. It is difficult for me to instruct you without some furtherindication of what is in M. Molotov&apos;s mind. Is he merely afraid that,if the States are not mentioned, some undefined loop-hole will beleft, such as that mentioned in paragraph 4 of your telegram? If so,the suggestion embodied in paragraph 8 of your telegram under replyought to reassure him.4. But I would not propose that you should put forward anyfurther text until by means of further conversations you have beenable to find out what is really at the back of if. Molotov&apos;s mind and what he is really holding out for. I should be grateful for anycomment you can make on his general attitude, and on what youconsider now to be the best line of approach.5. Whatever suggestion I may eventually instruct you to putforward, you should, in doing so, try again to make M. Molotovrealise that the independence of Holland and Switzerland is as essential to Great Britain and France as that of the Baltic States toBussia. No guarantee has been given to these two States becausefor obvious reasons they do not wish to receive one, but, if completereciprocity is to be accorded, they should be treated naturally on thesame footing as the Baltic States.6. I may observe parenthetically that M. Molotov appears to regard the guarantees to Poland and Roumania as a purely Franco-British interest. But in point of fact a threat to these countries would constitute an indirect threat to Bussia and our guarantee is thus an important contribution to Bussian security.No. 61.Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, June 23, 1939.Your telegram of 22nd June.*You will since have received my telegram of 22nd june reporting on the outcome of yesterday&apos;s conversation. We think we are nowsufficiently aware of what is in M. Molotov&apos;s mind without havingrecourse to further interview with him.2. The conclusion I had reached after that conversation wasthat we now appeared to have exhausted all means of arriving at asettlement on the crucial point of guarantees to other States on thvlines of the drafts which we had ourselves submitted. It seemed tome that we had now to decide definitely whether to accept theprinciple embodied in article I of the Soviet draft of 2nd JuneJor to conclude a simple treaty of mutual guarantee against directaggression.
3. I will try in the present telegram to recapitulate what seerato me to be M. Molotov&apos;s reasons for holding that there is a fundamental difference between the Soviet draft of 2nd June and thetwo drafts we have recently submitted to him.4. Paragraph 2 of article 1 of the Soviet draft of 2nd June notonly names certain States, but also provides for a common under-taking by the three Powers to defend those States against aggression.We understood from M. Molotov yesterday that the Soviet Govern-nient stand firmly by both these principles, though they are perhaps not wedded to the precise expression given to them in their draft.5. There are two reasons why the Soviet Government insist onan enumeration. The first is that, being suspicious by nature andhaving little confidence in the good faith and resolution of theWestern Powers in the light of past experience, they wish theobligations to be assumed by the three Powers to be set down inblack and white and to be clear beyond dispute.6. The second reason is one which applies equally to their desire for a common guarantee by the three Powers of the States named,ft is, I think, that they wish to have some international warrant forgoing to the assistance of the Baltic States, even perhaps without the assent or contrary to the wishes of the Governments concerned.7. They are intensely suspicious of the Governments of theBaltic States. They seem to fear that the Baltic States mayvoluntarily, or under pressure, move into the German orbit and accepta degree of German domination which the Soviet Government would regard as a menace to their security. They therefore have it in mind to secure our assistance, or at, the least apparent connivance, should they -ever find it expedient to intervene in the Baltic States (notnecessarily in case of a major conflagration, but in conditions whichwe would not regard as threatening peace of Europe) on plea that governments and ruling classes as distinct from rest of populationof those countries were about to compound with Germany.8. A further reason why they propose a common undertaking by the three Powers to defend the States named in their draft maybe that they wish as a matter of pride to place themselves on thesame footing with Great Britain and France, and they have accordingly offered to add their own guarantee to those already givenby Great Britain and France to Belgium, Poland, Turkey7, Boumaniaand Greece, asking in return a similar undertaking in respect of theBaltic States.9. In the light of the above considerations, I would suggest thefollowing reasons for M. Molotov&apos;s objection to the redraft ofarticle 1 communicated to M. Molotov on 21st June* : 10. Paragraph 1 of that draft did not make it clear beyondquestion that the Baltic States would be fully covered. It did notspecify who was to judge whether an act of aggression against theBaltic States constituted a menace to the the Soviet Union.
This was a loophole through which Great Britain and France mightevade their obligation to assist the Soviet Union. No such loopholefor the Soviet. Government seemed to exist in paragraph 2 of ourdraft, since the mere fact of Great Britain and France becomingengaged in hostilities on behalf of a country to whom they had given a guarantee would apparently of itself bring into play the obligation of the Soviet Union to come to their assistance, and the SovietGovernment would have little voice in the matter. There was here again the consideration of national pride, since the introduction of aspecial paragraph to deal with the guaranteed States stressed thefact that the guarantees in question had all been given by GreatBritain and France, and that the Soviet Union had not beenconsidered acceptable as a guarantor.11. There is the further objection that our draft only createsobligations for the signatory Powers towards each other and does not create new obligations for the signatories to assist other States.M. Molotov asked us how in the event of an attack on Poland Eussiacould possibly help Great Britain and France if she were not to helpPoland.No. 62.Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscow).Sir. Foreign Office, June 28, 1939.I asked the Soviet Ambassador to come to see me to-day in orderto discuss with him the present position of the Anglo-Soviet negotia-tions now proceeding in Moscow-. I showed the Ambassador our lastdraft of article 1.* The Ambassador had evidently not seen it andstudied it with great attention. I told him that it seemed to us tomeet all M. Molotov&apos;s requirements, but we were now told thatM. Molotov had rejected it in a note in which he gave no reasons.I asked if M. Maisky could explain exactly in what respect our draft was unsatisfactory, but M. Maisky declined to commit himself, and merely said that this was surely a matter which Sir William Seed?would be able to ascertain in Moscow. 1 replied that I shouldnaturally have hoped that this would have been the case, but, as amatter of fact, it seemed impossible to obtain much enlightenmentfrom M. Molotov on the subject. I, of course, was aware of the factthat he attached importance to the treaty containing a list of thecountries whose independence the signatories had undertaken todefend, but I could not make out why he attached particular importance to this naming of the States.
2. I then asked M. Maisky point-blank whether the SovietGovernment wanted a treaty at all; to which M. Maisky said thatof course they did, and why did I ask the question? Because, Ireplied, throughout the negotiations the Soviet Government hadnot budged a single inch and we had made all the advances and concessions.S. M. Maisky&apos;s only answer to this was that his Governmenthad probably made a mistake in frankly stating at the outset whatwas their irreducible minimum. Perhaps they ought to have askedfor more than they wanted so as to be able subsequently to make concessions. In any case, he could not understand why we were soreluctant to agree to a list of countries to be defended. To this I said that saying &quot;No&apos;* to everything was not my idea of negotia-tion, and that it had a striking resemblance to Nazi methods ofdealing with international questions.4. In spite of a good deal of sparring on M. Maisky&apos;s part, the conversation was carried on in a most friendly spirit, and I concludedit by asking the Ambassador to tell his Government that we wanted a treaty, and that, if they wanted one too, we ought to be able toreach a settlement without further difficulty.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.No. 68.Viscount Halifax to Sir TT . Seeds (Moscou^.Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, June 27, 1939.Your telegram of 23rd June.*I am grateful for this full and clear statement of Soviet point ofview.2. It seems certain that M. Molotov will make difficulty about any draft which differentiates in any way between guaranteed and non-guaranteed States.3. It is plain also that he wishes obligations of Powers to be clearly defined.4. It may be that he also feels that this cannot be secured without nominal roll of States figuring in treaty, though I should hope that this difficulty might be avoided if we could convince him that we are not attempting to restrict his liberty, at his discretion, to intervene against aggression designed to threaten or undermineindependence or neutrality of Baltic States.[20469]o
5. I should accordingly hope that agreement might be reached onfollowing formula : &quot;The United Kingdom, France and the U.S.S.R. undertaketo give to each other immediately all effective assistance shouldone of these countries become involved in hostilities with a european Power as a result of aggression by that Power against any one of these threo countries, or aggression by it against another European State whose independence or&apos; neutrality the contracting country concerned felt obliged to defend against suchaggression.&quot;6. You will observe that this brings together in one grouping all states to whom assistance might be given. It also gives the SovietGovernment the right to decide whether any aggression against aBaltic State constitutes a threat to the independence or neutrality ofthat State, such that the Soviet Government feels obliged to assist the victim of aggression by engaging in hosilities with the aggressor.Once engaged in such hostilities, the Soviet Government would beentitled to assistance from France and Great Britain. This is surelygiving the Soviet Government all they ask.7. I hope this will show m. Molotov that our intentions aresincere and that our aim is the same. If he can be convinced of this,we have a right to ask him to meet us on a matter of form and to have some regard for the considerations we have urged against publicmention of States in question. He may not share our apprehensionsas to the embarrassment and disadvantage that is to be expected froma public announcement of what amounts to a guarantee of states who are reluctant to accept or receive such, but we feel them to bevery real. Boumania has expressly indicated her desire not to be mentioned by name; Finland and Estonia have publicly stated their objections to receiving a guarantee involving the Soviet Government,and have declared that airy assistance from any Great Power without their invitation would be regarded by them as an act of aggression.Latvia has made it clear that she is in full sympathy with the attitudeof Finland and Estonia. Nor can we predict the reaction of theNetherlands. And if the published list of States to be assisted figures in, or is attached to, the Anglo-French-Soviet Agreement, it is to beexpected that Germain&apos; will at once ask all the countries mentionedwhether they welcome such undertakings, and will quite likely elicitthe response that they did not. The result of such replies must be one of extreme embarrassment to all of us and very prejudicial to the solidarity of the peace front.8. For these reasons, if you can satisfy M. Molotov that mydraft formula gives him what he wants, I wish to avoid any mention of States. If, however, it is necessary to have a nominal roll of States.I should infinitely prefer to supplement the formula in paragraph &quot;*above by a private agreement between the contracting Governments,which it should be definitely understood should not be made public as to the States to which it should in any case apply.   This might be
subject to periodical revision or addition by agreement between thethree contracting Governments.9. We trust you will impress very strongly on M. Molotov howfar His Majesty&apos;s Government have been willing to go in desire tomeet Soviet Government. We have not been met by correspondingconcessions by Soviet Government, and as we have now givenM. Molotov substance of all he has asked, we do expect agreement tobe reached without further obstacles being raised from the other side.No. 64.Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow presents his complimentsto His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, andhas the honour to transmit translation of an article by M. Zhdanovon the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations for the conclusion of an effective pact of mutual assistance against aggression, from the Pravdaof the 29th June, 1939.Moscow, June 30, 1939.Enclosure in No. 64.Translation of an Article by M. Zhdanov in Pravda of June 29, 1939.&quot; The English and French Governments do not want an agreement on Terms of Equality with the U.S.S.R.&quot;The Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations for the conclusion of an effective pact of mutual assistance against aggression have reached animpasse. In spite of the extreme clarity of the attitude of the SovietGovernment and in spite of all their efforts to reach a speedyconclusion of a mutual assistance pact, no real progress can be observed in the course of the negotiations. In the present inter-national situation this fact cannot be without serious significance. Itgives wings to the hopes of the aggressors and all enemies of peace hopes for a possible breakdown of the agreement of the democraticPowers against aggression; and it, drives the aggressors on to furtheracts of aggression.In this connexion the following question arises: What is causing the delay in these negotiations, the successful outcome of which isimpatiently and hopefully awaited by all peace-loving nations and allfriends of peace? I will venture to express my personal opinion onthe subject, although my friends do not agree with it.   They still
think that the English and French Governments began negotiationsfor a mutual assistance pact with the U.S.S.R. with the intention olcreating a powerful barrier against aggression in Europe. Myopinion is, and 1 will endeavour to prove it by facts, that the english and French Governments do not want an agreement on terms of equality with the U.S.S.E., by which I mean the only form ofagreement that any self-respecting State could conclude, and Iconsider this to be the cause of the state of stagnation which thenegotiations have now reached.What is the nature of these facts? The Anglo-Soviet negotiations,1 use that word in its most literal sense, i.e., reckoning from theloth April, the date on which we received the first English proposals,have now lasted for seventy-live days. Of this period, the SovietGovernment only required.sixteen days for the preparation of then-replies to the various English drafts and proposals; the remainingfifty-nine days were wasted in procrastination and delay on the partof the English and French. Who. one may ask, is responsible in this case for the slow progress of the negotiations, if not the English andFrench&apos;?It is a matter of common knowledge from practical experienceof the conclusion of international agreements similar to the Anglo-Franeo-Soviet one that this self-same England concluded pacts of mutual assistance with Turkey and Poland within a very briefperiod: which only goes to show that when England wished to conclude the agreements with turkey and Poland she found themeans of ensuring the necessary tempo in the negotiations. Theinadmissible delays and endless procrastination in the negotiationswith the Soviet Union must raise doubts as to the sincerity of thereal intentions of England and Franee, and make us wonder what, in point of fact, is behind such a policy : Is it a serious endeavour toform a peace front&apos;? Or is it their desire to make use of thenegotiations, and of the delay attending them, for some ulteriorobjects which have nothing in common with the creation of a front of the peace-loving Powers?Such a question becomes all the more insistent hi view of theposition of the English and French Governments in piling upartificial difficulties in the course of the negotiations, and making itlook as if serious differences of opinion existed between Englandand France on the one hand and the U.S.S.E. on the other, on questions which, given goodwill and sincere intentions on the partof England and France, could have been settled without a hitch. Thewell-known example of this sort of artificially created stumbling-blocksin the negotiations is provided by the question of a tripartiteguarantee of immediate assistance to Latvia, Estonia and Finlandin case of a violation of their neutrality by the aggressors. There isclearly no foundation for statements that the said Baltic States donot want these guarantees, and that it is this consideration which prevents England and France from accepting the Soviet proposals.Such statements can only be inspired by one motive, namely, the
desire to complicate the negotiations and to bring them to a dead end.In any case we all know of instances which prove that when, forinstance, England considers it to be in her interest to guarantee this or that country, she can find ways and means of &quot;doing so without waiting for the countries concerned to ask for guarantees for themselves.The English newspaper, Sunday Times, states in its issue ofthe 4th June that, &quot;should Great Britain be involved in hostilitiesas a result of an attack on Holland, Poland has agreed to come toher assistance.&quot; The Sunday Times continues : &quot; On the other hand,if Poland is involved in hostilities as the result of an attack on Danzigor Lithuania, Great Britain has agreed that she will come to theassistance of Poland.&quot; Hence it follows that Poland and GreatBritain simultaneously guarantee both Lithuania and Holland, andwe do not know whether Lithuania and Holland were asked about this bilateral guarantee. In any case, there is nothing clear on thesubject in the press. Moreover, both Holland and Lithuania, so faras I am aware, deny the existence of such a guarantee. An agree-ment for the bilateral guarantee of these two countries has, however,already been concluded in principle, according to the Sunday Times,and it is no secret to anybody that the statement in the Sunday Timeshas not been denied anywhere.Not long ago the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Beck, inan interview given to a French journalist, stated amongst other thingsquite unequivocally that Poland had no demands or requests to make as regards the granting to her of any guarantees by the U.S.S.R.,and he also stated that she was perfectly well satisfied with the recently concluded trade agreement between herself and the soviet union. What difference is there in the present case between theattitude of Poland and that of Government circles in the three Baltic-States? Absolutely none. This, however, does not prevent Englandand France from asking the Soviet Union to guarantee not onlyPoland and four other countries (of whose desire to receive guaran-tees from the U.S.S.B. we know nothing), but also Holland and switzerland, with whom the U.S.S.B. is not even in ordinary diplo-inatlc relations.All this argues that the English and French do not want anagreement with the U.S.S.E. based on the principles of equality andreciprocity, in spite of their daily protestations of their desire for&quot;equality.&quot; What they want is an agreement in which the soviet union would play the part of a hired labourer and bear the wholeweight of responsibility on its shoulders. No self-respecting country will conclude such an agreement unless she wants to be a playthingin the hands of people whose habit it is to allow others to pull thechestnuts out of the fire for them. Still less can such an agreementbe acceptable to the Soviet Union, the power, might and dignity ofwhich are known to the whole world. It seems to me that theEnglish and French do not want a real agreement or one acceptable to the U.S.S.B.: the only thing they really want is to talk about an
No. 65.Sir IF. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, July 1, 1939.French Ambassador and I took action this morning on yourtelegram of 27th June.*2. We submitted to M. Molotov draft of article 1 contained inparagraph 5 of your telegram. M. Potemkin asked whether the phrase &apos;&apos; felt obliged &apos;&apos; was to be interpreted as covering only atreaty obligation or whether it covered also an obligation dictated by vital interests.   We told him that it covered both.3. M. Molotov made it clear that in the view of the SovietGovernment this draft as it stood was too vague and that it wouldbe necessary to give it precision by adding a nominal roll. we suggested that the list of States might be embodied in an unpublishedannex to the treaty. He said that he thought that the SovietGovernment would be willing to agree to this.4. We submitted to him a draft for this purpose the text ofwhich is given in my immediately succeeding telegram, t5. M. Molotov at once said that the inclusion of the Netherlands.Luxemburg and Switzerland introduced a new element into thenegotiations. He reverted to his arithmetical arguments, which arenow familiar enough not to require repetition. lie thought it wouldhe difficult if not impossible for the Soviet Government to acceptobligations in respect of the Netherlands and Switzerland (he didnot mention Luxemburg). In the first place the Soviet Governmenthad no diplomatic relations with these two countries and it would therefore be juridically and politically objectionable for the SovietGovernment to undertake obligations in respect of them. (We herepointed out that the obligation would not be to them but to us.) Ir.the second place such obligations would represent a serious additionto those to be assumed by the Soviet Government. The fact thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government had in thisway extended the scope of the treaty would make it necessary for agreement and, by making play with the obstinacy of the soviet union, to prepare their own public opinion for an eventual deal withthe aggressors.The next few days must show whether this is the case or not.Deputy of the Supreme Councilof the C.S.S.R. :A. ZHDANOV.
the Soviet Government in their turn to consider the situation afresh.There were two questions which they would have to study : (A) The possibility of establishing normal relations between theSoviet Union on the one side and the Netherlands and switzerland on the other.(B) The possibility of obtaining compensation elsewhere for theincreased obligations which the inclusion of these twocountries in the list would involve for the Soviet Union.He noted, for example, that Poland and Turkey had madeagreements of mutual assistance with both Great Britainand France. The Soviet Union would have to considerwhether she could not. make similar arrangements with poland and Turkey so that the assistance- which poland and Turkey would undertake to afford to the Soviet Unionmight compensate for the assistance which the soviet union were now being asked to undertake to afford inrespect of the Netherlands and Switzerland.G. We asked whether this meant that the Soviet government wished the present negotiations to be interrupted until these two questions could bo settled. M. Molotov replied that the two questionshe had mentioned were logically and politically bound up with our proposal for an extension of Soviet obligations to cover theNetherlands and Switzerland. The Soviet Government must therefore study them carefully.7. We asked whether this represented the official reply of theSoviet Government. M. Molotov said that what he had given wasa preliminary expression of his personal reactions. He would submitour proposals to the Soviet Government and let us have a reply.8. We left him in no doubt that the inclusion of the netherlands and Switzerland was a matter of vital importance for Great Britainand France. The two Governments were ready to accept obligations in respect of all the States covering the Western border of the soviet union. It was essential to them as a matter of reciprocity that theSoviet Government should assume corresponding obligations in respectof the Netherlands and Switzerland which were as important forGreat Britain and France as were&apos; the Baltic States to the soviet union. The aim of the treaty being the establishment of security in Europe, the treaty must cover countries in Western Europe aswell as in Eastern Europe.9. During the conversation M. Molotov raised one other pointin connexion with our new draft of article 1. Our draft providedfor cases of &apos;&apos; direct aggression &apos;&apos; against one of the three contractingcountries or against one of the States mentioned in the list. It didnot make provision for cases of &quot; indirect aggression.&quot; This wouldbe particularly important in the case of the States mentioned in the list. He had in mind circumstances such as President Hacha&apos;ssurrender last March. We told him that this was a new point.There was nothing about such indirect aggression in the Soviet draft
of 2nd June* ; and, indeed, our new draft gave the Soviet Governmenteverything that they had asked for in their own draft. He repliedthat the question of indirect aggression had been discussed duringthe conversations and that the Soviet Government were as muchentitled as were His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Govem-ment to raise new points during the discussions. He suggestedthat the point might be met if the words &quot; direct or indirect&quot; couldbe inserted after the word &quot;aggression&quot; in the second place inwhich that word appears in our new draft article 1. We told him that we should have to refer this suggestion to our Governments.* No. -18.No. 66.Sir W. Seals to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.)

Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, July 8, 1989.My telegram of 3rd July.*We did not make much progress in regard to Holland and switzerland.2. When M. Molotov said that his Government could only acceptsecret list with omission of those two countries, I said we had reached a remarkable situation inasmuch as Soviet Government, which had always harped on our alleged lack of sincerity and on the unfairnessof our proposals, were now. after all our concessions, expectingBritish and French assistance in the event of direct or indirect aggression against any part of their European frontiers, while an aggressor had only to attack us through Holland or Switzerland inorder to make sure that, under existing draft, Soviet Union wouldnot be bound to come to our assistance.3. M. Molotov said that Holland and Switzerland were a newextension of Soviet liabilities proposed by us after meeting of theSupreme Council, when he had mentioned (and obtained approval ofthe People&apos;s representatives) five countries plus Baltic States: no more countries could therefore be added. But later on he suggestedthat if Poland and Turkey made pacts of mutual assistance with soviet union those two countries could be dropped out of number of third party States and their names replaced in list bjT those of holland and Switzerland.4. As regards alleged extension of Soviet Governments liabilities-ties, French Ambassador pointed out that Soviet Government had originally offered more than they were doing now. By the presentomission of article 1 (8) of the Soviet draft of 2nd June! we werebeing, in fact, penalised for our concessions in regard to baltic states.   M. Molotov answered that acceptance of secret list was a
concession on part of Soviet Government, and that it must be balanced by dropping provision about countries which might requestassistance. He would not accept my argument that secret insteadof published list was only a matter of form, while loss of a provision which might cover countries like Holland was one of substance.5. He pointed out that Soviet Government were not objectingin principle to considering an extension of their liabilities in respectof those two countries, but they must have compensation in theform of treaties of mutual assistance with Poland and Turkey.0. He only mentioned absence of diplomatic relations with twocountries as a technical difficulty, but we feel we cannot be sure thatthat obstacle will not be raised later.No. 70.Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscoic).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, July 6, 1939.Your telegrams of 3rd July.*1. The French Government are anxious that a further effort should be made to secure the inclusion of Holland, Switzerland andLuxemburg, and they are telegraphing arguments to be employed in further discussion with M. Molotov. I concur, and you may concert with your French colleague in exhausting every possible means ofsecuring inclusion of these three countries, but if, as I anticipate,M. Molotov remains adamant, you may inform him that HisMajesty&apos;s Government agree, though very reluctantly, to omission of Iloliand, Switzerland and Luxemburg, but only on condition that satisfactory solution is found of question of indirect aggression.2. The definition of indirect aggression which the SovietGovernment now propose! is completely unacceptable. We could not possibly defend it either to the countries concerned or to publicopinion here. Questions as to the meaning of &quot; indirect aggression,&quot;if this term is employed in the published agreement, are bound to beraised, and, if so, we should either have to reply in the sense of the definition in the unpublished protocol, or give an untrue statementof the position.8. It must be remembered that this phrase, and the secretdefinition of it, have not previously appeared in the discussions, andare how suggested for the first time. The use of the term &quot; indirect aggression &quot; would confirm the worst suspicions of the Baltic States,whose objection to the proposed treaty rests largely on their fear ofRussian interference in their internal affairs. M. Molotov seemsimpervious to the argument that it is undesirable to drive the baltic states gratuitously into the arms of Germany, but we cannot overlookthis consideration.* Nos. 67, 68, 69.t No. 68.
-1. Nevertheless, we should be prepared to meet fullyM. Molotov&apos;s demand that Russia should be covered not only in thecase of direct aggression, but of indirect aggression, such as thatpractised against Czeeho-Slovakia on 15th March last (the case towhich he seems constantly to he referring). We should accordinglypropose that the first paragraph of the unpublished protocol shouldbe altered to read as follows: &quot; It is understood between the three contracting governments that article I of the agreement between them signed to-day will apply to the following European States, and that the word&apos; aggression &apos; is to be understood us covering action accepted bythe Slate in question under threat of force by another Power andinvolving the abandonment by it of its independence or neutrality.&quot;5. It is understood that for the reasons stated in paragraph y,article I of the agreement should speak only of &quot; aggression,&quot;omitting words &quot; direct or indirect.&quot;6. Although prepared in the last resort to agree to the omission of Holland, Switzerland and Luxemburg, subject to agreement onthe point about &quot; indirect aggression &quot; on lines indicated above, Iam anxious that some provision should be made in the treaty fordealing with German aggression on these three countries. you should, therefore, try to induce M. Molotov to agree to include inthe unpublished protocol a provision for immediate consultation between the three Governments at the request of any one of themin the event of aggression against Holland, Switzerland orLuxemburg. Such a provision should also not figure in the agree-ment itself, but would have to be inserted in the unpublishedprotocol.7. We would be prepared to accept the above solution outlined in preceding paragraphs, provided that it secures a rapid settlement and that the other outstanding points are disposed of accordingto the instructions which you already have.No. 71.Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscoic).Sir, Foreign Office, July 6, 1939.I asked the Soviet Ambassador to call on the 6th July to discussrecent developments in our negotiations with the Soviet Government.I said that I was glad to note that agreement had been reached on certain important points. We had informed M. Molotov that we were willing to agree to a list being drawn up and he had agreed that this list should not be published. Although we did not expect the listwould remain a secret, we thought this procedure preferable.
2. Unfortunately, two further difficulties had arisen during thelast exchange of views at Moscow. In the first place, the SovietGovernment had objected to the inclusion of the Netherlands and switzerland in the list. This caused us very great difficulty as wehad always supposed that the Soviet Government were in favour of complete reciprocity. As we had now agreed to guarantee the east of Europe, we expected that the Soviet Government, would beprepared to give a similar guarantee for Western Europe.51. Molotov had taken the line that he only had authority to guaranteeeight States Poland, Turkey, Eoumania, Greece, Belgium, Finland,Estonia and Latvia. Therefore, unless two of the States were leftout, he was not in a &quot;position to include two additional States. Hehad therefore suggested that his difficulties might be removed if theSoviet Government, were to negotiate pacts of mutual assistance with poland and Turkey. This seemed to us a curious argument and didnot meet our difficulty regarding the question of reciprocity.M. Molotov&apos;s attitude also seemed to us to be a departure from what we had understood to be the general aims of Soviet policy as defined by II. Stalin on the 10th March.8. Our second difficulty was that M. Molotov now desired thewords &quot;&apos; indirect aggression &quot; to be added in the text of the publishedtreaty and a definition of the meaning of these words to be includediu the unpublished annex. The suggested Soviet definition was quiteunacceptable to us, since it could be represented as authorising almostunlimited interference in the affairs of the Baltic States. We had gone as far as we possibly can in dealing with the Baltic States andwe could not accept a formula of this nature. We had thereforeredrafted it in such a way as to meet the sort of case which M. Molotovseemed to have in mind, e:y., conduct such as that of Dr. liacha andthe Czecho-Slovak Government in submitting to a threat of force last march. We hoped it would be possible to reach agreement on thebasis of our redraft. I intended to send fresh instructions to moscow to-night if the French Government agreed, but I could not concealfrom 51. Maisky that it would be difficult for us if M. ilolotov stillfelt unable to include the Netherlands and Switzerland in the list.-1. 51. Maisky thanked me for my information and said that,although he was kept informed by bis own Government, it was helpful to have the views of both sides, lie reminded me, however, that thenegotiations were being conducted in Moscow, and that it was there-fore difficult for him to say anything definite. He saw the difficultieshut did not think they were insurmountable.5. I then asked 51. Maisky for his personal advice on the follow-ing question. I thought all delay was most regrettable and I had nodoubt we were in agreement that it was important to get somethingsettled quickly. I therefore wanted, if the French government agreed, to send a telegram to Moscow laying down the limits withinwhich a settlement could be reached and giving a certain latitude toour negotiators to reach agreement within these limits, thus puttingan end to the perpetual exchange of telegrams and consequent delays.
If, however, there were still further difficulties, I wondered whetherit might not be better to fall back upon a purely tripartite agreement as an immediate possibility and then pursue our discussions afterwardswith regard to the questions concerning other States.6. M. Maisky replied that he could only express his personal opinion on this point, but it occurred to him that M. Molotov had suggested such a solution on the 16th June. If we wanted to reach a quick result, he thought we might, however, include in the treaty the eight States about which we were already agreed. This wouldgive a far wider basis than the purely tripartite agreement and other questions could be left over for discussion. I pointed out that therewould still remain the difficulty about the definition of &quot;indirect aggression&quot; and that it might take considerable time to find a formula to meet this difficulty.7. I asked M. Maisky some questions regarding the method of negotiation in Moscow, but could only elicit from him thatM. Molotov had to refer back to a Committee of the People&apos;sCommissars, similar to our own Foreign Policy Committee, although he himself had the usual authority of a Foreign Minister in conductingnegotiations.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.No. 72.Sir IF. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, July 9, 1989.We spent nearly three hours with M. Molotov this evening andwent over the whole ground again.2. Soviet Government insist on inclusion of the words &quot;director indirect&quot; in article 1. We said that we were not authorised toagree to this.8. M. Molotov submitted a completely new draft of the protocolwhich he now calls a &quot; supplementary letter.&quot; For h-anslation ofthis draft please see my immediately following telegram. *4. We asked him what kind of case the phrase &quot;without anysuch threat&quot; was designed to cover. M. Molotov made an obscurereference to Danzig, and added that Latvia or Estonia might, forexample, make an agreement with Germany which would be incon-sistent with their independence or neutrality without there being any threat of force on Germany&apos;s part. We also asked him what wasmeant by the term &quot; use of the forces of the State in question.&quot;The example he gave was the employmient of German officers orinstructors by the Estonian or Latvian army and the consequent trans-formation of those armies into instruments of aggression against theSoviet Union.
5. You will see from paragraph 2 of M. Molotov&apos;s new draft ofthe protocol that Holland and Switzerland are included in the list,but that it is stated that the agreement will only apply to them whenTurkey and Poland have concluded pacts of mutual assistance withthe Soviet Union. M. Molotov added during our conversation thatit would be necessary also that Holland and Switzerland should bein diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union before article 1 couldapply to them.   He declined to include Luxemburg in the list.6. A long discussion took place on article 6 (relation between thepolitical agreement and military agreement). M. Molotov said thatit was absolutely essential in the view of the Soviet Governmentthat these two agreements should not merely enter into force butalso be signed simultaneously. There were differences of opinion among members of the Soviet Government on some points connectedwith the agreement, but on this point they were unanimous. Asthe result of persistent questioning we were able to discover thatthe procedure which M. Molotov would accept is the following. Assoon as agreement has been reached on the text of the seven articlesof the political agreement, the text of each article in three languageswould be initialled. Conversations between the General Staffs wouldthen immediately begin, and on the conclusion of the negotiationsfor a military agreement the texts of the political and military agree-ments would be signed at the same time and come into forcesimultaneously. Although the text of the political agreement wouldhave been settled, this agreement would exist only as a series ofarticles and not as a diplomatic instrument until such time assignature of the two instruments could take place. The articles ofthe, political agreement would not be published before signature,although as soon as the text had been agreed upon announcementscould be made by the three Governments outlining the contents ofthe various articles.7. We expressed our astonishment and pointed out toM. Molotov with the greatest emphasis our objections to this course,but he was quite immovable. He said that without a military agree-ment the political agreement would be a mere empty declaration, andthe Soviet Government were not prepared to sign any political agree-,ment unless they could at the same time sign a military agreement which would form an organic whole with the political agreement.The only suggestion he was apparently prepared to make was thata date should be fixed in article 6 for the conclusion of the military agreement.8. In these circumstances my French colleague and I think wecan carry the negotiations no further without further instructions.
No. 74.Viscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (M^oscow).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, July 12, 1939.Your telegrams of 9th July.*I fear that we cannot possibly accept M. Molotov&apos;s formula as given in paragraph 3 of your telegram.t Our concern throughouthas been to avoid anything which might give the impression thatthe signatories claimed the right to intervene in the internal affairs of the countries with whose independence and neutrality they are interested. It was for this reason that in trying to describe indirect aggression we have always applied two tests : (1) that the Govern-ment of the country concerned should be acting against its willSir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, July 9, 1989.Following is translation of draft referred to in paragraph 8 ofmy immediately preceding telegram&apos; : &apos; &quot;Supplementary letter.&quot; The   three   contracting   Governments   have   agreed   asfollows : &quot;: Article ] of the agreement signed by them to-day will apply to the following European States: Turkey, Greece,Boumania, Poland, Belgium. Estonia, Latvia, Finland.Switzerland, Netherlands.&quot;2. As regards the two last-named States (Switzerland and netherlands) the agreement will only enter info force if and whenPoland and Turkey conclude pacts of mutual assistance with theU.S.S.B.&quot;3. The expression &quot;indirect aggression,&apos; covers actionaccepted by any of the above-mentioned States under threat of force by another 1&apos;oicer, or without any such threat, involving the use of the territory and forces of the State in question forpurposes of aggression against that State or against one of the contracting parties, and consequently involving the loss by that state of its independence or the violation of its neutrality.&quot; The foregoing list of States is subject to revision byagreement between the three contracting Governments.&quot;The present supplementary agreement will not be made public.&quot;* No. 72.
under threat of force by another Power; and (2) that the action should involve the abandonment by that State of its independenceor neutrality. To carry definition of indirect aggression beyond thispoint is to defeat our own ends, for the methods by which a country can be coerced so as to abandon its independence or neutrality are so manifold that it is impossible in the scope of any formula to coverall eventualities, and to try to do so is bound to lead to nothing butsuspicions and misunderstandings, both between the signatoriesthemselves and among the other countries concerned. This notonly would not serve the purposes which we and the Soviet Govem-ment have at heart, but would most certainly undermine our wholemoral position in Europe generally, and give the German Governmentinvaluable opportunity for setting the smaller countries against us.2. But it is precisely such, over-definition that the RussianGovernment appear to be aiming at. and the result is a formula which I am convinced would fill the States concerned with mostprofound suspicions as to our intentions.3. The words &quot;or without any such threat &quot; would, as you haverealised, allow each signatory to decide whether any voluntaryarrangement which the State in question might make with a potentialaggressor was to he interpreted as being &quot; for purposes of aggression &quot;even though no aggression had taken place. Such a claim to interpretand pass judgment upon the actions of an independent State is oneto which His Majesty&apos;s Government could not possibly be a party.4. The insertion in M. Molotov&apos;s formula of the words &quot; andforces&quot; after &quot; territory &quot; would similarly be open to abuse and istherefore likewise objectionable.5. Again, the words &quot;&quot;for purposes of aggression&quot;&quot; would seemto give each signatory the right to judge whether the &quot;use&quot; towhich the territory and forces of the State concerned were being putwere &quot;for purposes of aggression&quot; or not. The signatory havingdecided that even though no aggression had occurred the ulteriorobject was aggression, might on the strength of this unilateraldecision proceed to hostilities and thereby claim to bring the wholeguarantee syrstem of the agreement into play. Similarly, the word&quot;consequently&quot; would imply that each signatory was the judge whether something short of complete subservience to a foreign state was to be considered as constituting the loss of independence orneutrality.6. Lastly, I see grave objections to the provision which is madein M. Molotov&apos;s formula with reference to aggression against the state in question in addition to aggression against one of the contractingparties. This no doubt is intended to cover the case of a civil war or coup d&apos;ft tat in which foreign forces were participating, but I donot think that this eventuality can be safely covered by any formof words and it ought not to be attempted. In fact, I am notprepared to accept the view that changes of Government, even ifbrought about by civil wars or coups d&apos;fttat, in the countries concerned, must necessarily threaten the interests of one or other ofT20469] q
the signatory Powers ami must on that account be prevented. the test still remains whether or not the country concerned has lost itsindependence or neutrality, and that is provided for in our formula.It would be highly unwise to proceed on the assumption that a coup d&apos;l&apos;!tat or civil war must necessarily deprive the country of itsindependence or neutrality merely because at some stage or otheranother State had &quot; used &quot; the territory of the State in question.7. In short, any attempt to amend M. Molotov&apos;s formula canonly be satisfactory if it is reduced in effect to the substance of our original formula as set forth in paragraph 4 of my telegram of6th July.*8. I am not clear whether when you presented our formula toM. Molotov he rejected it outright, and if so gave any reasons forthis rejection ; or whether he merely offered his own formula as analternative. In any case you should now tell him that for the reasons give in the preceding paragraphs you are unable to accept hisformula of 9th July, and urge him as strongly as you possibly canto study our formula with the utmost care, since in substance it represents the utmost limit that we are prepared to go in the directionof a definition of indirect aggression. I do not insist upon preservingevery word in the present text, but the general sense is essential toour purpose. If he is prepared to examine it without prejudice andwithout unwarranted suspicions, he will realise that it covers all thepossible cases which would justify the Soviet Government in calling upon their allies to join them in going to war with Germany overevents occurring in one of the limitrophe States. You will also realise that whereas our definition should not unduly offend thesusceptibilities or arouse the fears of the limitrophe States, any furtherdefinition would most certainly do so.9. Incidentally, we should prefer, if our formula is accepted, to embody it in article 1 of the Agreement instead of relegating it to theunpublished annex. In that case any reference to &quot; direct or indirect &quot; aggression in article 1 would be unnecessary, but we wouldbe ready to agree to the retention of the phrase if M. Molotoff attachesimportance to it.10. I will now turn to the new difficulty which M. Molotov hasraised in insisting that the political agreement must wait upon amilitary agreement, which will only be signed simultaneously. Wemost strongly object to this completely abnormal procedure. Thefact that M. Molotov should make this demand reveals a suspicion ofour sincerity and bonu fides which is most offensive and quite uhjnsti-fiable, more especially as we are prepared immediately on signatureto start military conversations. The natural course in all agreements of mutual assistance is for the political agreement to precede themilitary arrangements. The insistence of the Soviet Government thatthe political shall be dependent on the military agreement suggeststhat unpleasant suspicion that the Soviet Government hope by this
means to force us to accept military conditions which would be against our better judgment. Otherwise it is difficult to see what the SovietGovernment stand to gain by withholding their signature to thepolitical agreement until the military arrangements have beencompleted. With the best will in the world the latter may takeconsiderable time, and during this period the absence of any political agreement will naturally be exploited by the German Government as evidence that the negotiations with the Soviet Government have broken down. We are sure that the Soviet Government will not wishto produce this impression any more than we do. You should therefore urge M. Molotov most strongly to persuade his government not to insist upon this condition.11. I appreciate the fact that I am setting you an arduous taskin instructing you to reject the two chief proposals which M. Molotovmade to you at your last interview. But we are nearing the point where we clearly cannot continue the process of conceding each freshdemand put forward by the Soviet Government. In order to meet m. Molotov we have made the following concessions : (1) We have met the Soviet Governmenfs demand that the treaty should cover thecase of the Baltic States; (2) we have abandoned our demand thatthe Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxemburg should be included among the countries to be covered by the agreement; (8) we haveagreed to provide for the case of indirect aggression; (4) we have,against our better judgment, undertaken to define it; (5) we are pre-pared to insert this definition in the agreement itself; (6) we have accepted M. Molotov&apos;s proposal that the agreement should contain aprovision prohibiting the signatories from concluding a separatearmistice or peace.VI. If. in return for all these concessions, the Soviet Governmentarc unwilling to meet us on the two points now at issue, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may have to reconsider their whole position. I do not suggest that you should actually say this to M. Molotov at the present stage, but it would be useful if you could find means of giving him tounderstand that our patience is well-nigh exhausted, and that he will do well not to presume any further on our readiness to yield to theSoviet Government each time they put forward a new demand.No. 75.Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.iTelegraphic.) Moscow, Jidy 17, 1989.We had a meeting to-day as M. Molotov was unable to receive usyesterday.2. After telling M. Molotov that we proposed as a concession tothe Soviet Governmenfs general views to put definition of indirect aggression into text of article 1 and even to consent to retainingwords &quot;direct and indirect,&quot; I said that His Majesty&apos;s Government
regarded it as of greatest, and even decisive, importance thatdefinition should he such as not to arouse suspicions of independent and neutral States and that I had received most precise instructions as to limits beyond which His Majesty&apos;s Government were notprepared to go in this matter. I said we were in agreement with theSoviet Government regarding the case where a Government underthreat of force from an aggressor took action against its will in sensewhich entailed loss of independence or neutrality, but we must avoidanything capable of being interpreted as an intention of interferingin another country&apos;s internal affairs. Formula must provide for acase where there existed a threat of force and where independence orneutrality was thereby imperilled, but nothing vaguer or more far-reaching could be accepted. For these reasons His Majesty&apos;?Government could not agree to latest Soviet formula and I was instructed to press the Soviet Government urgently to accept ourdefinition, which, if carefully and impartially examined, would beseen to cover all that was required and all that was legitimate.3. M. Molotov said that our formula was inacceptable; it was too vague and too restricted. In reply to question, he said that he must insist on the inclusion of the words &quot;without threat of force&quot;(because otherwise formula would not cover case like that of president Hacha, who would have denied that he was acting underthreat) and of words &quot;use of territory and forces.&quot; After vainlyprotesting that his formula could be interpreted as empowering onesignatory to drag other signatories into hostilities if a third Govern-ment exercised its right to decide its own policy, I suggested that wewere prepared to consider verbal changes in our formula so long assubstance was maintained. But he was not to be moved. Sovietdefinition represented official decision of bis Government and hekept on pressing us to pass on to the next item on agenda.1. We then submitted a new draft of the protocol omitting theNetherlands and Switzerland from the lists of States, but adding ageneral formula providing for consultation &quot;in the event of aggression or threat of aggression by a European Power against a european State not named in the foregoing list.&quot; M. Molotov saidthat he noted with satisfaction that the two Governments were disposed to omit the Netherlands and Switzerland from the list andthat he would consider the formula for consultation which they had submitted, though at first sight it raised doubts in his mind.5. M. Molotov then asked whether we had any further remarks to make on other points. We turned to article 6,* and put to bin:the arguments contained in paragraph 10 of your telegram of12th July.! M. Molotov made it clear at once that the SovietGovernment must insist upon the simultaneous entry into force ofthe political and military agreements. He said indeed that in theSoviet conception there would not be two agreements (a political anda military agreement), but a single politico-military agreement.   The
political part would have no existence without the military part. TheSoviet Government wished to have the military obligations and contributions on each side clearly settled. On this point there shouldbe no misunderstanding. Unless His Majesty&apos;s Government and theFrench Government could agree that the political and military partsof the agreement between the three countries should form one organicand inseparable whole, there was no point in pursuing the presentconversations. He begged us to put this point to our Governments,and proposed that further discussion should be adjourned until an understanding on this point had been reached. He alleged that ithad been throughout the idea of the Soviet Government that thereshould be a single politico-military agreement, and that the idea ofseparating the two agreements had been introduced into the diseus-sions at a later stage. In the circumstances we did not think any-useful purpose would he served by arguing about this extremelydebatable assertion.6. He said that, if this point of fundamental principle could besettled, the question of how agreement on the text of the politicalarticles was to be recorded was a technical matter of secondaryimportance. We reminded him that he had agreed at our last meeting that the political articles might be initialled when agreement had been reached on them, and that: statements might he made in public by the Governments concerned giving the substance of thearticles on which agreement had been reached. M. Molotov did not,however, commit himself definitely to agree to this procedure.7. He put. the definite question whether or not His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and French Government were really willing to openmilitary conversations. We assured him that they were, and theFrench Ambassador said that he thought the French Governmentwould be willing to begin military conversations at once without waiting for the signature of the political agreement. M. Molotovasked me my opinion, and I told him that we should be ready withoutfurther delay to start technical conversations, but only if agreement had been reached on the articles now under discussion. french ambassador asked whether the idea of the Soviet Government wasto open military conversations at once before conclusion of discussion on the political articles and parallel with those discussions.M. Molotov said that if the two Governments made an officialproposal in this sense he thought that the Soviet Government might agree.8. He repeated that the question to which he asked us to obtain a definite answer was whether the two Governments were preparedto agree that political and military parts of the agreement should form one organic whole.M. Molotov then started to rise with the remark that our twoGovernments&apos; decision on this question was the crucial point, andthat nothing else mattered much. I stopped him and begged to remind him of what I had said on the question of indirect aggression,
which was of supreme importance to His Majesty&apos;s Government.I said frankly that my reports on our latest conversations had produced a painful impression in London, where it was felt that wewere making fruitless concessions. Our stock of goodwill was not yetexhausted, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would give full considera-tion to Soviet views regarding article G; in return we hoped for similar goodwill in regard to definition of indirect aggression. Inreply he gave me no encouragement beyond general assurance of goodwill.No. 76.Sir W. Seeds to  Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, July 23, 1989.We saw M. Molotov this afternoon.2. I opened the proceedings by saying that I had faithfullyreported to your Lordship the capital importance attached by theSoviet Government to the simultaneous entry into force of thepolitical and military agreements. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsobjection to this course had been mainly of a practical character,since they feared that the existence of an interval between theconclusion of the political agreement and its entry into force would encourage an aggressor. I was happy to inform him that HisMajesty&apos;s Government, with the goodwill they had always shownin these negotiations, and after consultation with the French Govern-ment, now accepted article 6 as it appeared in the Soviet draft* and agreed to the simultaneous entry into force of the two agreements,jr. Molotov expressed his keen satisfaction.3. I observed that two points now remained outstanding, thechief of which was the definition of indirect aggression in article 1.I recalled tiiat at our last conversation I had assured M. Molotovthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would examine the question ofarticle 6 with complete goodwill, and had expressed the hope thatthe Soviet Government would study with the same sympathy thequestion of the definition of indirect aggression, which was a questionof principle for us. We had submitted to him revised drafts ofarticle 1 and of the protocol. We hoped that M. Molotov was in aposition to say that the Soviet Government accepted them.4. In reply to a question by M. Molotov, the French Ambassadorsaid that the French Government were in full agreement with whatT had said.5. M. Molotov said that he had already explained the point ofview of the Soviet Government as regards the definition of indirect aggression in article 1 and as regards the protocol. He did not nowthink, however, that these questions would raise insuperable difficul-ties. and he was convinced that the three Governments could find
a formula which would satisfy them. The important point from theSoviet point of view was to define the form and extent of militaryengagements of the contracting parties. Was he right in takingour reply to mean that, in our view, the three Governments had reached a basis for an agreement, and that the engagements to beundertaken by the three Governments should now be concretelydefined? I asked him whether he meant by this question that military conversations should be started. He said that he did. I said that His Majesty&apos;s Government were ready to start military conversations, but they wished first to reach agreement on the outstanding political points; as M. Molotov had said that therewould be no insuperable difficulty about this I thought it preferable that the outstanding political points should be settled at once so thati here might be a political basis on which the military conversationscould be conducted.(!. M. Molotov repeated that he did not foresee any insuperable difficulty about article 1 and the protocol, and for that reason it wasnecessary to start military conversations immediately. Since HisMajesfcy&apos;s Government and the French Government had now agreedto the simultaneous entry into force of the two parts of the agree-ment, it was essential that there should be no further delay aboutI he opening of military conversations.7. The French Ambassador observed that in order to study themilitary problems if was necessary that the main political basisshould he settled. It was, therefore, desirable to try to reach agree-inent at once on the two outstanding points since, if there was no agreement on these, a study of the military problems would not bepossible.8. M. Molotov replied that although the definition of indirect aggression would not present insuperable difficulties, it was a delicatequestion on which there was still a slight difference of view. If we now pursued discussions on this subject and put off the military conversations, we should lose more time. The international situation was such as to impose on the tln-ee Governments the duty of makingconcrete arrangements with the least possible delay. The french ambassador said that he understood the Soviet proposal to be that military conversations should start at once. M. Molotov agreed. TheFrench Ambassador repeated that French military experts, before theystarted conversations, would have to be informed of the politicalbasis which had been agreed upon for the military conversations.M. Molotov thought the political basis was already clear enough topermit of the opening of military conversations. It would be aneedless waste of time to put off military conversations until the lastremaining details were settled. The fact that the three countries were engaged in settling the concrete details of their obligations would beof great interest to possible aggressors.9. I said that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no intention ofwasting time. I was ready to report by telegram at once what he had said. but. pending a reply to bis proposals, could we not get to work
on settling the two outstanding points? M. Molotov asked why itwas thought necessary to waste time upon points of detail and delay the consideration of the essential problem, i.e., the military conversa-lions. without which the treaty would have no substance. I repeated that 1 thought it would be useful to go on discussing article 1 andthe protocol pending a reply from His Majesty&apos;s Government and theFrench Government. T felt hound to insist also that the questionof the definition of indirect aggression was, for Flis Majesty&apos;s Govern-inent. not a point of detail, but a question of principle.10. M. Molotov repeated that once the military experts had started their indispensible work of defining the military obligations of contracting parties, the two outstanding political points could easily be settled. I asked him whether five Soviet Government were readyto accept the two principles which formed the basis of our proposeddefinition of indirect aggression, namely, that the State in question should be acting under threat of force, and that its action shouldinvolve the abandonment of its independence and neutrality. GouldI report to His Majesty&apos;s Government that Soviet government accepted these two principles? M. Molotov gave no reply to thisquestion beyond repeating once again, tins time in the name of theSoviet Government, that, during military conversations, the outstanding political points could easily be settled.11. He then asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government and tin-French Government had any objection to the immediate opening ofmilitary conversations, or whether they still had some doubts onthe subject.12. The French Ambassador repeated that military conversationsmust have a political basis. He recited the articles of draft treaty on which agreement had been reached: and the two points whichwere still outstanding. Even if His Majesty&apos;s Government and theFrench Government were ready to start military conversationsimmediately, it would be necessary for the three Governments to record that they had reached an agreement on such and such articles and that there were still differences of view on two outstanding points. I said that I saw no obstacle to the immediate opening ofmilitary conversations except for the two points still outstanding.13. M. Molotov asked whether he was to take it that HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the French Government would be unwilling to open military conversations until these two points hadbeen settled.14. The French Ambassador replied that proposal made byM. Molotov was a new one, and that, until he had reported it to theFrench Government and learned their views, he could not give anofficial answer to if. Molotov&apos;s question. I said that this was alsomy position. He said he was not sure whether we were right insaying that his proposal was a new one. At our last interview hehad spoken about the immediate opening of military conversations.The French x\mbassador and I said that we thought he had spoken
[20469]chiefly about the simultaneous entry into force of the two parts ofthe agreement.15. I asked whether M. Molotov&apos;s idea was that the military conversations and the political discussions on the two outstanding points should be carried on concurrently. He replied that it was.1 asked him whether he had thought where military conversationswould take place. He said he hoped that, if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the French Government saw no objection, they might beheld in Moscow and that they might open immediately. He hopedthat the two Governments would be able to give their reply very soon.16.   French Ambassador thought that, if it was decided to startmilitary conversations,   it   would  be  desirable   to  issue   a  jointcommunique announcing that such a decision had been taken.    1agreed and suggested that declarations might also be made bythe Governments concerned.   I said that our public opinion would wish to be assured that we had not been wasting our time in moscow and that progress bad been made on the main points.   french ambassador thought announcement might be to the effect that thethree Governments considered political conversations to be suffiently advanced for military conversations to be opened.17.   M. Molotov promised to study this suggestion.18.   French Ambassador thought it was true to say that, if thethree  Governments  started  military conversations,  this in  itself would imply that they bad reached agreement on the main politicalquestions and that they took a common view in regard to inter-national affairs and had the same objects.   M. Molotov agreed withthis statement, but said the military part of the agreement was moreimportant than the political part, and. since the political part wouldhave no existence without the military part, he was not quite sure whether any preliminary declaration by the Governments concerned about the political articles would be necessary.1!&apos;. French Ambassador and I observed that French and british ministers would certainly be questioned in Parliament and wouldhave to say something to the effect that the three Governments had reached agreement on the main political questions and that theywere now passing on to military conversations. I said that, I agreed with M. Molotov that the political treaty would not be effective without the military treaty, but, from the point of view of publicopinion, this was not the point. The public would ask what the twoambassadors had been doing in Moscow all these months, and itwould be necessary to give them some information.20. M. Molotov observed in conclusion that the mere fact thatthe military conversations were starting would have a much greatereffect in the world than any announcement that could be made aboutthe political articles. It would be a powerful demonstration on thepart of the three Governments.
No. 7S.Viscount Halifax to Sir II&apos;. Seeds (Moscow).Sir. Foreign Office, July 25, 1939.The Soviet Ambassador called on the 25th July, and I informed him of the result of your Excellences latest conversation with theSoviet Minister for Foreign Affairs.2. I told M. Maisky that you had informed M. Molotov that weunderstood that the Soviet Government regarded article 6 to be themost important point at issue, and that you had been authorised tomeet the Soviet Government by agreeing to the simultaneous eon-elusion of military and political conversations. We continued, how-ever, to attach great importance to the question of indirect aggressiondealt with in article 1, and we hoped that agreement might be reached on this point.   M. Molotov had replied expressing appreciation of ourViscount Halifax to Sir W. Seeds (Moscow).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, July 25, 1989.You should now inform M. Molotov that Ilis Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are ready to agree to immediate initiation of military conversa-fions at Moscow without waiting for final agreement on article 1 andprotocol, or any other outstanding points in agreement. I hope in afew days to give you names of our representatives and the probabledate of their arrival. For your information on purely materialgrounds, some little time must elapse before the members of themilitary mission can he selected from the three services and supplied with the necessary data and authority. This will be done with theutmost urgency.2. Meanwhile, you should make it clear to M. Molotov, wheninforming him that we will start military conversations, that, whilsthe may attach capital importance to them, we attach capitalimportance also to a satisfactory settlement of article 1. We shallaccordingly expect that present discussions will be resumed forthwith,with a view to settlement of outstanding questions in political agreo-ment, in particular article 1, and we hope that M. Molotov will, in asimilar spirit, meet us on the points to which, as expressed above, we attach such capital importance, so that they may now be brought to aspeedy and satisfactory conclusion at the earliest possible moment.3.   From what you report of M. Molotov&apos;s attitude, there wouldappear to be some prospect now that Soviet Government may not Inrigid over article 1, and that the moment in which we announce our readiness to start military conversations immediately may be the most Ifavourable one for inducing them to meet us over article 1.
attitude regarding article ti, and had suggested that it should not be too difficult to reach agreement on article 1.3. M. Molotov had asked whether we would agree to theimmediate opening of military conversations, his idea being that thiswould avoid any further delay and would have a good effect on thegeneral situation. T went on to inform M. Maisky that you had referred M. Molotov&apos;s question to me, and that we were nowinstructing you to agree to military conversations being opened assoon as a suitable military mission could he collected. The FrenchGovernment were following the same course.1. We thought that it would take at least a week or ten days toappoint a suitable military mission, and to provide its members withthe necessary instructions. Wo had originally thought that Pariswould be the best place for these conversations, but, in view ofM. Molotov&apos;s insistence, we were now prepared to agree to thembeing held at Moscow.5. I emphasised to M. Maisky that we continued to attachcapital importance to reaching agreement on the political articles, andthat we hoped that, as we had met M. Molotov on the question ofStaff conversations, he would now be prepared to meet us over thequestion of indirect aggression. As M. Maisky knew, we thoughtthat our formula fully covered the case of Czecho-Slovakia, but, ifany other case should arise which was not covered by our formula,we were prepared for immediate consultation, just as we, on our part, expected the Soviet Government to agree to similar consultation in the case of the Netherlands and Switzerland.6. We agreed with M. Molotov that the opening of military conversations would have a real value as regards world publicopinion, and we hoped it would also remove any doubts that mightexist in the minds of the Soviet Government. We should thereforeho disappointed if real progress could not now be made.7. M. Maisky thought that the arrangement which I had outlined to him was a good one, and that the deterrent value of staff conversations would be very great and impress the outside worldmore than any other step could have done. Meanwhile we could proceed with the elaboration of the outstanding political points.1 said that I hoped there would be no delay over this, and that instructions were being sent to you to see M. Molotov to try to reach an agreement on these points without waiting for the arrival of our military mission in Moscow. I asked M. Maisky whether he had any indication of the views of his Government about the most recent developments. He replied that they considered real progress hadbeen made. They welcomed this fact and hoped that we were nowapproaching the end of our negotiations.8. M. Maisky then enquired what detailed arrangements we hadin mind and whether the members of our mission had yet been selected. I told him that I had already approached Lord Chatfieldand that I could assure him that there would be no unnecessary delay.We should require to consult the Soviet Government shortly about
the terms of a statement which we should have to make in Parliamentprobably at the beginning of next week. This would be no morethan a general statement to the effect that certain political points were still outstanding, but that the three Governments weivengaging at once in military conversations. Finally, I impressed upon M. Maisky that this information must be kept confidential forthe present.I am. Ac.HALIFAX.No. 79.Sir 11&quot;. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, July 27, 1989.At our meeting with M. Molotov this afternoon I spoke to him iii the sense of your telegram of 25th July*, informing him of theagreement of His Majesty&quot;s Government to the immediate initiation of military conversations in Moscow, and of their expectation that discussions on outstanding political points would be resumed forthwith.The French Ambassador spoke in the same sense and hoped SovietGovernment would help the two military missions to find convenientaccommodation in Moscow. This M. Molotov promised to do.M. Molotov was unable, in reply to question by French Ambassador,to give any information as to the composition of Soviet delegation.2. In reply to my observation about the settlement of outstandingpolitical points, M. Molotov said that Soviet Government werestudying the question of indirect aggression.8. I asked him whether the definition could be discussed at anearly meeting without waiting for the arrival of the military missions.It was important for His Majesty&apos;s Government that this question should be settled without delay.4. M. Molotov enquired whether the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and French Government on this point was immovable.Would they refuse any modification in their formula? If so, solution would be difficult to reach.5. I replied that as I had told him before, we were ready to admit changes of wording, but the substance must be preserved.The basis of our definition was: (a) that there should be threat of force; (b) that there should be abandonment of indejjendence andneutrality. Our formula was wide enough to cover any legitimatecase that might arise. If we tried to make the definition wider,we should find ourselves countenancing interference in internal affairs of third States; and this His Majesty&apos;s Government were notprepared to do. I hoped that, before our next meeting, he would look at our formula again, and see if he could suggest some alternativewhich, though it might change the words, would maintain substance.
(5. M. Molotov said that he thought our formula could heimproved. It ought to be amended so as to cover the case of president Hacha, and also the case of Danzig, i.e., the case of an internal movement which modified the external position of anotherSlate. He hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the FrenchGovernment would have alternative drafts to propose as well as theSoviet Government: if so, he was convinced that a satisfactoryformula could he found.7. French Ambassador said that the definition of indirect aggression was important, and that all three Governments were agreed in trying to find a means of dealing with a new form of aggression.Hut His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government wishedto avoid using expressions which implied that the three governments would interfere in internal affairs of other States.8. I said that in the viewr of His Majesty&apos;s Government the caseof President Hacha was fully covered by our draft. There had been an evident threat of force. What President Hacha might say about it was not evidence.9. French Ambassador suggested certain historical examplesmight be quoted in the protocol to illustrate meaning of the term&quot;indirect aggression.&quot; M. Molotov asked, with a smile, whether itwould not be as well to quote future cases also. He again asked that the two Governments should try to find a compromise formula.My French colleague and 1 said that we would do so and compareour results with his. I asked him whether we might have an interview for this purpose at an early date, and he said he had noobjection.No. 80.Statement by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons onJuly 81. 1939. about Military Missions.The Soviet Government has proposed that at the present stateof the negotiations it would be an advantage to begin military con-versations forthwith. His Majesty&quot;s Government and the FrenchGovernment have concurred, and arrangements are being made tosend British and French military representatives to Moscow as soonas possible. It is proposed that, concurrently with the military con-versations, political discussions should continue with a view to reachingfinal conclusion on the terms of the political agreement. The british delegation will be headed by Admiral the Hon. Sir Reginald PlunkettFrnle-Erle-Drax, and will include Air Marshal Sir Charles Burnettand Major-General Heywood.
Extracts from Speeches by the Prime Minister and the parliamentary under-Secrctary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House ojCommons on July 81, 1939.The Prime Minister: The lion, member and the right hon. gentle-man opposite both devoted a large part of their speeches to thenegotiations with Eussia. Both of them suggested, though they didnot actually say so, that the delay in coming to an agreement was entirely the fault of this Government. I do not know whether theFrench Government were also included. Both of them said that theyhad been kept in the dark, although the hon. member opposite after-wards professed to give a time-table. I think he called it, of thenegotiations to illustrate his thesis that the delay had all been onthe side of the British Government.He said it in such a way as to convey the impression, the deliberateimpression, that though he did not. seek to allocate the blame,meaning to say that he could not prove it, he wished the House tounderstand that the blame did lie. and lie entirely, with theGovernment. The hon. member opposite has been very proud of hispersistence in asking questions about the course of these negotiationsfor a long period of time, and, in fact, he has tried for a long timeto goad me into recriminations against the Soviet Government, by seeking to put the blame for the delay upon this Government. Iff have restrained myself, if I have refused to enter into discussion as to the differences which prevented the completion of the agree-ment between ourselves and the Soviet Government, if I have clonethat all this time, that is the measure of the sincerity of my desireto come to an agreement. I can assure the committee that it hasrequired some self-control to abstain from refuting the falseimpressions which the hon. gentleman has sought to convey.No, Sir, I am not going to-day to give a historical summary ofthe negotiations between the British and the French Governments,on the one hand, and the Soviet Government on the other, for that very reason. T know perfectly well that there are people in othercountries who are watching very jealously the progress of these negotiations, and who would he exceedingly glad for any ammunitionwhich they could use in order to divide the Soviet Government and ourselves. I do not propose to give them that ammunition. Ofcourse, there is no secret about the fact that the Soviet Governmentand the British and French Governments combined have not hitherto been able to agree upon a definition satisfactory to all parties of the term &quot;indirect aggression,&quot; although all three of us realise thatindirect aggression may be just as dangerous as direct aggression,and all three of us desire to find a satisfactory method of providingagainst it. At the same time I have the agreement of the right on. gentleman we are extremely anxious not even to appear to bedesirous of encroaching upon the independence of other States.   And
if we have not agreed so far with the Soviet Government upon thisdefinition of indirect aggression, it is because the formula which theyfavoured appeared to us to carry that precise signification.I have not the slightest doubt that if you were to make out an accurate time table you would find that much more time had been ,consumed by the British Government and the French Governmentin making their answers to the Soviet Government than has beenconsumed by the Soviet Government in making their answers to us.is not that natural and, indeed, inevitable? M. Molotov wasconducting these negotiations on the spot. If he wished to refer tohis own Government he had only to drive a short distance throughthe city and he was in their presence. The British and FrenchAmbassadors had to refer to their respective Governments and toreport on each stage of the negotiations. We had to communicate with one another and agree upon the answer before we could reply.Therefore, when the hon. member opposite talks about this dawdlingdiplomacy, without precedent. T wonder whether he has looked upthe precedents or whether it was just one of those phrases that hethrows off in order to denigrate the Government.I have looked up one or two precedents, just to see whether, infact, these negotiations provide an outrageous exception to the general rule of expedition in conducting negotiations which involve more thaniwo parties.   The Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which was a bi-lateralarrangement,   took six  months  to  negotiate.    The  Anglo-FrenchEntente of 1904 took nine months.   The Anglo-Bussian convention of 1907 took fifteen months, and the negotiations which led up to theTreaty of Locarno took  eight months before they arrived at a conclusion.    It would have been  possible,  perhaps,  to make  a provisional agreement at an early date with the Soviet Government,referring to a later date the conclusion of a detailed treaty.   Thatwas the course that we pursued with Poland and with Turkeyr, andwe and the French Government would have been quite ready tohave followed that course in this case, but the Soviet government thought otherwise.   They preferred to sign nothing, to initial nothinguntil we had got to a complete agreement, and as a result of thatwe were not able to present the world, as I would have liked to do,with even a provisional agreement at an earlier stage.The announcement which I made to-day at question time showsthat we have done something that must, I think, be almost withoutprecedent in history in negotiations of this kind. We have agreed and the French Government have agreed to send military missionsto Moscow to engage upon staff conversations with the correspondingofficers appointed by the Bussian Government, before we have cometo a political agreement.TIere is a country which is a long way off and with which we hadnot had close relations for a very long time. We are showing a greatamount of trust and a really strong intention to bring these negotia-tions to a successful issue when we can agree to send our sailors,soldiers and airmen to Bussia to discuss how we can make our
military plans together before we have an assurance that we shallyet be able to come to an agreement upon political matters. TheRussian Minister lor Foreign Affairs, in the course of conversation,expressed the view that if we once began those military conversations,to which ho attached very great importance, the political difficulties should not prove insuperable. Tt was that expression of view whichweighed with us in taking this very unusual decision, and it certainlyis the sincere hope of the French Government and ourselves thatthis anticipation of M. Molotov will be realised, and that we shall find it possible to agree not only in substance but also in form uponthe remaining outstanding political difficulties.Mr. Butler (summing up the Debate) : It would be wrong if. inthe last minute or two at my disposal. T did not make some referenceto Russia. I can add very little to what the Prime Minister has said on this subject. My right hon. friend the Member for Warwick andLeamington (Mr. Eden) said that the agreement was rather like Roche-foncauld&apos;s reference to ghosts and love: everyone had heard of them,but no one had seen them. All I would say is. instead of ghosts andlove, do not let us have bogies and suspicions about Russia. There ii-no reason whatever for the sort of remarks that were made by the hon.gentleman opposite. We have proceeded with the utmost vigour todiscuss with Russia our outstanding difficulties, and. as was rightlyobserved by the right hon. Baronet, the main question has beenwhether we should encroach on the independence of the Baltic States.We are in agreement with the right hon. Baronet that we should no:do so, and the difficulty of reaching a formula on this point is oneof the main reasons why there has been delay in these negotiations.We are, therefore, in agreement with him on this point, and I trust that now. with what we have achieved over the last few months, withthe growing strength of this country, with the determination we haveshown, and with the success of our diplomatic efforts, we can at anvrate face the summer ready for anything.No. 82.Extract from the Speech by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affirmin the House of Lords on August 3. 1939.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Viscount Halifax):Now I must say something about Russia. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have, I suppose, taken the lead in endeavouring to organise a combination of resistance against aggression, and the fact that theprincipal portion of blame for every difficulty or delay falls on themshows indeed that their leading role is generally acknowledged. Ifthe world were just, His Majesty&apos;s Government would receive, ofcourse, the lion&apos;s share of credit for whatever has been achieved,but as the world, or the people in it, is or are not always just, Hi?
Majesty&apos;s Government make no complaint at all of shouldering thegreater part of the blame for real or imaginary failures. Tire basisof British policy has been, as your Lordships are aware, close co-operation with France in defence of interests that are common,as was explicitly laid down in the declaration made so long ago asthe beginning of February by my right honourable friend the PrimeMinister in another place. It was starting from that point that HisMajesty&apos;s Government offered their guarantee to Poland and roumania, and undoubtedly by doing that they made a substantial contribution to the security of Russia and it was in view of the factthat they felt obliged at that time to act promptly, with, I think Ican say, the approval of the overwhelming mass of opinion in thiscountry not in the presence of Lord Ponsonby (dearly unanimous,hut I think the overwhelming mass of opinion that they did not make their action dependent on receiving any counterpart then andthere from the Soviet Government.The present negotiations with Russia have, as we all know, as their  object,   the   strengthening  of   the   forces   against   possibleaggression, and noble Lords will no doubt realise that to provide an instrument which will cover every possible contingency is a very-complicated task which must inevitably give rise to certain diver-gencies of view.   Moreover, as we also know very well, the problem is further complicated by the necessity of trying to provide for thenew technique of indirect aggression.    His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the French Government and the Soviet Government are in full agreement on the necessity of trying to make such provision, butthe differences which have arisen relate to the precise form in whichthis elusive shadow of indirect aggression can be brought to definition.Our common object is to find a formula which may cover what mayrightly be  regarded  as  indirect aggression without  in  any wayencroaching on the independence and the neutrality of other States,and it is no secret that the proposals that the British and french governments have made have appeared to the Soviet Governmentinsufficiently comprehensive, whilst the formula favoured by theSoviet Government has seemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government and theFrench Government to go too far in the other direction.   The delays-and I confess, although I am naturally restrained in judgment, Iam not so pessimistic as Lord Ponsonby who talks in terms of years which have occurred have not only arisen from the complexity of theproblem in hand which affects the rights and interests of a verylarge number of States.I rather doubt whether even noble Lords, and I am quite surestill more of the general public outside, fully realise all that is involved in negotiations of this character. It is quite true that an interim agreement such as those made with Poland and with Turkey-can be concluded relatively quickly; in the case of both thesecountries, the formal agreements are still under discussion. Thenoble Lord, Lord Davies, asked me whether our agreement with poland included a definition of indirect aggression and, if it did.[20469] s
why it was not possible to transplant that definition into the RussianAgreement. Well, the answer is that the formal agreement with poland is still being agreed, it is still not concluded, and the arrange-ment on which we have been working and are working with Polanddoes not, I think, refer to indirect aggression in the form that he hasin his mind, and for the simple reason that will be at once apparent tothe noble Lord if be casts his mind back, that our guarantee to Polandrested upon a perfectly simple, precise, but rather different basis.Our guarantee to Poland, he will remember, was made operative inthe event of Polish independence being clearly threatened and thePolish Government feeling it necessary to resist and so on. However,that is rather by way of parenthesis.The Soviet Government, in contradistinction from what we were able to do with Turkey and Poland, preferred to proceed without anyintermediate stage to the conclusion of a formal agreement, and theterms of that formal agreement naturally have rerjuired careful con-sideration, and it was inevitable that there was a great deal ofdiscussion to be done on the drafting and so on. I was very glad to hear the noble Lord, Lord Davies, acknowledge, as he very fairly did.that the fact that we had to agree any modifications and alterationswith the French Government necessarily and inevitably involved a Icertain measure of additional time expenditure. It has been assumed Iin some quarters, and I rather think that Lord Davies assumed it jto-day attributing, indeed, I think, to me a certain role that seemedto him appropriate that bad His Majesty&apos;s Government been repre-sented by a Cabinet Minister instead of an Ambassador a quickagreement would have been secured. Well, I do not really know what warrant he can certainly feel to have for any such surmise, andI do not think experience supports him. He will remember, as Tremember, the Washington Naval Conference, for example, in 1921.when His Majesty&apos;s Government was represented by a most dis-distinguished Minister, the late Lord Balfour. Although the ground forthat conference had been prepared with the utmost diligence through diplomatic channels it took no less than three months there to secure agreement. In the present case, I understand, M. Molotov is obligedat every stage to consult his Government, and the same would have applied to any British representative, whether in the Cabinet or outof the Cabinet, who had been on our behalf conducting the negotiationsfor His Majesty&apos;s Government in Moscow. The fact that His Majesty&apos;?Government and the French Government have decided to despatchmilitary missions to Moscow I think they leave, if I am rightlyinformed, the day after to-morrow before full agreement has beenreached on the political issues may be held, I hope, to be the bestevidence of the bona fides and determination of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and concrete evidence not only of our interest to bring these negotiations to an early and successful conclusion but of our belief that that step will facilitate outstanding discussions on political issue?which will proceed simultaneously with the military discussions.
No. 84.Sir IF. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscmo, August 2, 1989.M. Molotov received us this afternoon.2. I informed him of the composition of our military mission and said that they would probably leave at the end of this week.M. Molotov said that this would be convenient and that he would shortly be in a position to give us the names of Soviet delegation.He asked whether our mission would be furnished with full powersto negotiate. I said that I could not answer this question as I havenot had to deal with military conversations before. In reply to aquestion from the French Ambassador as to procedure for conversa-tions, M. Molotov suggested that the three heads of the delegationsmight meet to draw up a programme.3. M. Molotov then said that he wished to state the views of soviet Government about remarks made by Mr. Butler in House ofSir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, August 2, 1939.Following is translation of Tags communique from Izvestiya of2nd August :  &quot;In his speech in the House of Commons on 81st July,&quot;Parliamentary Dnder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler,said, according to the press, that the British Government were doing all they could with a view to hastening the removal ofexisting differences of opinion between U.S.S.B. and England,the chief of which is the question whether we should infringe theindependence of the Baltic States or not.&quot; &apos; I agree,&apos; said Mr. Butler, &apos; that we should not do this,and it is in this difference of opinion that chief reason for delay in the negotiations is to he found.&apos;&quot; Tass are authorised to state that, if Mr. Butler really madethe foregoing statement, he misrepresented the attitude of theSoviet Government. In actual fact, the differences of opinion donot lie in question of infringement or non-infringement of theindependence of Baltic States, since both parlies are in favour ofguaranteeing that independence, but in question not leaving inthe formula about &apos; indirect aggression &apos; any loophole for an aggressor who is making an attempt on the independence of theBaltic States. One of the reasons for the delay in the negotia-tions lies in the fact that the British formula leaves such aloophole for an aggressor.&quot;* No. 81.
ia-2Commons on 551st July, which were the subject of a communique in soviet press this morning (my telegram of 2nd August&quot;). Mr. Butlerhad grossly misrepresented the Soviet attitude as regards the baltic states. I asked M. Molotov whether he had the full text ofMr. Butler&apos;s remarks. I had not myself seen it. lie repliedhe had the full text from Tass Agency. I suggested that muchwoidd depend upon the exact words used. I was convinced,however, that there had been no intention on the part of Mr. Butlerto say anything wounding to Soviet Government. In fact, I was sure that the contrary was the case.4. M. Molotov said that Mr. Butler had represented the Sovietformula as meaning that the Soviet Government wished to infringethe independence of Baltic States. Attitude which Soviet Governmenthad taken up was one which contemplated the defence of independence and neutrality of the Baltic States.5. I repeated that I did not know exactly what Mr. Butler had said or wiiat he had been reported as saying. In the course of our conversations we had made no such accusation against SovietGovernment. What we had said was that it was in our viewessential to avoid using any word or any phrase in the treaty whichWould give cause for suspicion in Baltic States or give a handle forhostile propaganda against us, and that we had in particular toavoid giving the impression that we considered it possible that anyof the parties should intervene in the internal affairs of other States.This was a danger which we felt it essential to avoid. Our objectionto that Soviet formula was that it might be interpreted in this senseby suspicious or hostile opinion. We had accepted the SovietGovernment&apos;s request for inclusion of the term &quot;indirect aggres-sion &quot; in the treaty, and when the Soviet Government had furtherpressed for a definition we had felt some hesitation about agreeing,precisely because we feared that hostile opinion might interpret the definition in the wrong sense. I felt sure that this must be what mr. Butler had in mind, namely, the importance of not giving cause for suspicion to the Baltic States or a handle for hostile propaganda.6. My general conclusion was that what had happened showedhow important question of indirect aggression was and how necessaryit was to come to an agreement about it soon. Could M. Molotovgive us a favourable opinion on the formula we had presented tohim? M. Molotov said that he had himself no new proposal to make and he asked whether I had any solution.7. I said that His MajestVs Government had considered thematter again, xvs I had already told M. Molotov His Majesty&apos;?Government thought that their formula covered all the cases thaiit was legitimate to cover and they could go no further. They were,however, prepared to agree that cases which might not be coveredby their formula should be made the subject of consultation. I thensubmitted  text  of our original formula together  with additional
sentence about consultation as approved.   M. Potemkin made an oral translation into Russian from the French text of draft.*8. M. Molotov said that additional sentence did not improve the definition. Consultation was not sufficient to meet cases which hebad in view. French Ambassador asked why INT. Molotov took thisview. M. Molotov replied that the sentence about consultation didnot provide for immediate assistance in cases contemplated.!). I said I understood M. Molotov thought our formula was too narrow and did not cover the cases which he had in mind. 1admitted that technique of aggression had recently been developed and was difficult to deal with hut I thought that if we tried to givetoo precise a definition we might run the risk of excluding (by that very precision) new or unforeseen cases which might arise in thefuture. That was one reason why we thought that consultationmight be useful.10.   M. Molotov agreed that consultation might sometimes benecessary but observed that in the cases he had in mind it was aquestion of giving immediate assistance.   The objection to our newsentence was that it weakened the play of the article as regardsimmediate assistance.   The draft definition which he had himselfsubmitted did not cover all cases of indirect aggression, and thosewhich it did not cover might be made the subject of consultation.The idea of consultation was already present in article 8.   lietherefore begged us to continue our search for a solution, and saidthat he would do his best to help us.   He thought his own draft wasa very modest one.   It was designed to cover at least the case of president Hacha and the case of Danzig, this was all that he had set out to do.   I replied that our draft of article 1 covered both theseeases.   M. Molotov observed that President llacha had accepted theGerman demands of his own free will and would not admit that hehad acted under threat of force.   To this I replied that everybodyknew that he had been acting under threat.   As regards Danzig, Ihad been in communication   with,  your  Lordship,  and  you had confirmed my impression that the case of Danzig was covered bywords &quot; indirect aggression&quot;&apos; in paragraph 2 of article 1.11. I observed that our formula covered not only the case of the victim who resisted or protested, but also the victim who not onlydid not protest, but pretended to act willingly even though it was clear that he was acting under threat of force.12. The French Ambassador asked whether M. Molotov wouldgive us the results of his study of the various formula?. The twoGovernments had done their best and had made a fresh suggestion.M. Molotov replied that he had as yet no concrete proposal to make.It he should later on have anything to suggest he would let us know.13. In reply to a question by Mr. Strang whether it was nowquite clear what was the nature of the difference between the three governments, M. Molotov said that he thought that the words* See text annexed.
&quot; under threat of force &quot; unduly restricted the scope of the Anglo-French definition. lie recalled that the Soviet Government had originally proposed a formula which His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe French Government had rejected, proposing a counter-formula oftheir own. Soviet Government had then tried their hand at a furtherdraft. The views of the Soviet Government were clearly expressedin terms of that draft.14. I said that we saw great clanger in the use of words&quot;&quot; without any such threat&quot; in the Soviet formula. They would arouse suspicions in third Stales and give a handle to hostilepropaganda. There was also the danger that if we claimed to invokethe treaty in respect of action freely taken by independent States weshould give the impression of wishing to interfere in their internal affairs:&apos;15. M. Molotov repeated that in his view the case of president llacha was not covered by the Anglo-French formula,f repeated the conviction of His Majesty&apos;s Government that it was.If it was for this reason alone that he wished to insert the words&quot; without any such threat,&quot; I begged him not to overlook the danger which I had already pointed out to him of using these words. our point was not that we thought that the Soviet Government wishedto interfere with internal affairs of third States, but that otherGovernments would proclaim that this was what the treaty meant.16. M. Molotov asked why, if that were so, Mr. Butlerhimself had placed this interpretation on the Soviet formula.I repeated that I could not admit that Mr. Butler had given this as his own interpretation. I believed that what he had tried to dowas to show that the Soviet formula was capable of this interpretation.Annex to No. 84.Draft Definition of Indirect Aggression.    Handed to M. Molotov,August 2, 1989.(8) It is agreed between the three contracting Governments thatthe expression &apos;&apos; indirect aggression&apos;&apos; in paragraph 2 above is to be understood as including action accepted by the State in question under threat of force by another Power and involving the abandon-ment by it of its independence or neutrality.In the event of circumstances arising which fall outside the frame-work of the foregoing definition, but which, in the view of one of the contracting Governments, involve a threat to the independence orneutrality of the State in question, the contracting Governments will immediately consult together at the request of any one of them witha view to such action as may be mutually agreed upon.

Butler explained to the Soviet Ambassador on 4th Augustthat he had not intended in his speech on 31st July* to convey theimpression that there was any difference of opinion between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Soviet Government on the questionwhether we wished to permit any encroachment upon theindependence and neutrality of the Baltic States.2. M. Maisky replied that he had listened to Mr. Butler&apos;s speech and realised that be had been left very little time to deal with the moscow negotiations at the end of the debate. Mr. Butler drew the ambassadors attention to the Prime Ministers earlier references tothe question of indirect aggression and he agreed that these accuratelyrepresented the position. His Excellency undertook to communicate with his Government and to inform them that any misunderstandingthat had arisen was due partly to the incorrect Tass version ofMr. Butler&apos;s remarks and partly to the fact that these had been rather elliptical in view of the fact that they were introduced at thevery end of a speech.* No. 81.

TheBritish Mission was headed by Admiral the Honourable Sir R. A. E.Phmkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, K.C.B., D.S.O., and its other members were Major-General T. - G. G. Heywood, O.B.E., andAir Marshal Sir C. S. Burnett, K.C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O. The FrenchMission was headed by General Doumenc, and also includedGeneral Valin. On the 3rd August His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in moscow was informed that the Soviet delegation would be preside over by Marshal Voroshilov, the People&apos;s Commissar of Defence, andwould also include Army Commander of the First RaniB. M. Shaposhnikov, Chief of the General Staff; Flagman Flotta oiSecond Rank PI. G. Kuznetsov, People&apos;s Commissar of the Navy;Army Commander, Second Rank A. D. Lokhtionov, Chief of the AirForce: and Corps Commander I. V. Smorodinov. Deputy Chief ofthe General Staff.Arrangements were immediately made for the British, and french military Missions to leave for Moscow at the earliest possible date,hut, as their instructions covered a very wide field, a few days were necessary to enable them to familiarise themselves with these instructions before their departure.
The British and French Missions left England on the 5th Augustby the steamship City of Exeter, which had been specially charteredfor the voyage, and arrived at Leningrad on the 10th August. Theyat once proceeded to Moscow, and conversations opened on theIIih August. The British and French delegations were given full powers to negotiate with the High Command of the Armed Forcesof the Soviet Socialist Republics on all questions regarding the collaboration needed between the armed forces of the Soviet union and those of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and NorthernIreland and of France.The Allied Missions were given a friendly welcome in Moscow. the conversations opened in a favourable atmosphere and meetings were held on five successive days from the 11th August to the 16th August.In view of the seriousness of the international situation, every effort was made by the allied missions to dispose of outstanding difficulties and reach an early agreement.Two main difficulties, bow-ever, arose at an early stage in the conversations. The first concerned naval operations in the Baltic,and the second land operations in support of Poland or Boumania.As regards the Baltic, the Soviet delegation intimated that they desired His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government tomake arrangements whereby British and French naval forces shouldbe able to use bases on the coast of Finland, Latvia and Estonia, on theAland Islands and on the islands at the mouth of the Gulf of Riga.  Itwas also the intention of the Soviet delegation that, once this had been satisfactorily arranged, these bases should be available to Sovietnaval forces, who would collaborate with Allied naval detachments inthe Baltic.   As His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Govem-ment had made it plain during the earlier political conversations in moscow that they could not countenance any action which might bei regarded by the Governments of Finland. Estonia or Latvia as anI infringement of their neutrality, the Soviet demands obviously raised aI fundamental difficulty.   Their significance has been clearly revealedI by later events.The second difficulty concerned the question raised by the SovietI military authorities as to whether the Polish and Roumanian Govern-1 ments would allow Soviet troops to operate in their territory in theevent of German aggression against their countries. The soviet authorities made it clear that the successful conclusion of the staff conversations depended on the readiness of these two governments to agree in advance to their demand and to draw up at an early date the plans necessary to provide for this eventuality. The SovietGovernment did not apparently consider that they were in a positionto approach the Polish or Roumanian Governments directly on this issue, and the Soviet delegation therefore stated that, in theiropinion, this approach should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the French Government.As Poland was at that time in more immediate danger from german aggression than Roumania, the case of Poland was considered
first. His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Governmenthad, however, to take account of the fact that the PolishGovernment were determined to avoid anything which might havethe effect of provoking an immediate German attack, and a Polish-Soviet agreement to permit the passage of Soviet troops throughPoland might well have had such an effect, and have precipitated the hostilities which it was the object of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotia-tions to avoid.These were questions with which the British and French missionsat Moscow were not empowered to deal, as they concerned theterritorial integrity of third Powers not taking part in the Moscownegotiations. The conversations were therefore adjourned on the17th August with a view to the question being reconsidered by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the French Government in consultationwith the Polish Government. Conversations took place in Warsawfrom the 17th August onwards, from which it appeared that the PolishGovernment were still unable to agree to any action which in th iropinion was calculated to accelerate German aggression, but that the;,did not exclude collaboration between Poland and the U.S.S.B. in th.&apos;event of common action being taken against German aggression.When the military conversations were resumed in Moscow on the21st August, a statement had already appeared regarding the con-clusion of a Soviet-German economic agreement. This was followed onthe 22nd August by the announcement of the decision to conclude a soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact and by the news of Plerr vonBibbentrop&apos;s impending visit to Moscow. No further progress could therefore he made in the military conversations.On the 25th August Admiral Drax and General Doumenc saw-Marshal Voroshilov and asked him whether, in the changed politicalsituation, he thought it likely that the Soviet Government would desire the military missions to continue their conversations. MarshalVoroshilov replied that, in the new political situation, there wouldbe no sense in continuing those conversations. The British andFrench Missions left Moscow shortly after this interview.No. 88.Sir IF. Seech to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.)

Seeds to Viscount Halifax.Telegraphic.) Moscow, August 22, 1989.Following is translation of Tass communique in press thismorning : &apos;&apos; After the conclusion of the Soviet-German Trade and credit Agreement, the question arose of the improvement ofpolitical relations between Germany and the U.S.S.E. an exchange of views on this question took place between the German
and Soviet Governments, which has established the existenceof a desire of both parties to relieve the tension in the political relations between them, to avert the danger of war; and to conclude a pact of non-aggression. In connexion with this matter the German Minister for Foreign Affairs. Heir von Ribbentrop,will visit Moscow in a few clays for the necessary conversations.&quot;No. 90.Viscount Halifax to Sir It&apos;. Seeds (Moscow).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, August 22, 1939.Ills Majesty&apos;s Government have noted a statement issued by theGerman official news agency to the effect that the German Govern-ment and the Soviet Government have come to an understanding with regard to the conclusion of a non-aggression pact.&quot;&quot; and that theGerman Foreign Minister will arrive in Moscow on 23rd August tobring the negotiations to a conclusion. They have also noted a state-ment by the Tass agency to the effect that, after the conclusion of theSoviet-German Trade and Credit Agreement, the Governments ofGermany and the Soviet Union desire to relieve the tension in their political relations, eliminate the war menace and conclude a non-aggression pact, and that, consequently, the German Foreign minister will arrive in Moscow in a few days for corresponding negotiations.These negotiations are further reported to have been proceeding forsome months.2. You should seek an immediate interview with M. Molotovand say that, in view of the negotiations which have been proceeding between Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union and which have gone far towards a successful conclusion. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfind it hard to credit this report. If confirmed, it would seem torender nugatory the results already achieved during the negotiations between the three Powers and to constitute an act of bad faith onthe part of the Soviet Government. It would, indeed, be incrediblethat the Soviet Government should have been carrying on, let aloneconcluding, such negotiations without a single word to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment or the French Government, with whom the Soviet union is already in treaty relations. That being so, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment prefer to suspend judgment upon this report until they can obtain official confirmation from the Soviet Government.3. You should therefore ask M. Molotov for an immediate replyand report to me at once.* Cmd. 6106. No. 61.
Sir W. Seeds to Viscount Halifax.(Telegraphic.) Moscow, August 22, 1939.Your telegram of 22ml August.&apos;I saw M. Molotov at 8 p.m. and spoke to him textually inaccordance with paragraph 2 of your telegram.2. He said that Tass communique represented the exact facts,but he rejected the accusation of bad faith; he would not admit theright of His MajestVs Government to employ that expression or to stand in judgment on the Soviet Government. In answer to mysuggestion that at least we should have received a warning, heretorted that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not inform SovietGovernment of modifications in their policy. I said that I was nottalking of changes in general policy in normal times, hut of a changesuch as this in the very height of negotiations.3. He wished to say that he had, as I knew, constantly andrightly reproached us during all these negotiations with a lack ofsincerity. Height of this insincerity had been reached when militarymissions arrived in Moscow empty-handed and, above all, quiteunprepared to deal with fundamental points on which whole questionof reciprocal assistance depended, namely, the passage of soviet troops through Polish and Roumanian territory. That showed thatwe were only &quot; playing&quot; with the Soviet Union. The Soviet delega-tion had again and again asked question and had repeatedly beenput off; finally (either yesterday or the day before), the SovietGovernment had made up their mind that they were being playedwith and &quot; had accepted proposal made to them by the GermanGovernment.&quot;4. I denied that mission had arrived empty-handed; they wereprepared to deal with questions concerning British and french military assistance. &amp;c, but a question of passage of troops throughthe territory of a third sovereign State was clearly not within theircompetence.5. A considerable portion of the interview was taken up withreiterations by M. Molotov of statements contained in foregoing two paragraphs.6. I asked what exactly the German proposal amounted to. Heonly pointed to Tass communique. I said that there were various forms of non-aggression treaties, and asked whether the treaty nowproposed would enable the Soviet Union to pursue what we had always understood to be her policy, namely, the protection of the victims of aggression. Would it, for example, mean that the Sovietwould stand still with arms crossed and allow Poland to be overrun?He clearly did not like this questioning and could only sayr that wemust wait and see how negotiations would work out.
7. I persisted that I wanted to know whether all we had achieved in the way of arranging a system of general defence against aggression was rendered null. Would it not he possible to continuethis good work? Finally, he said that it all depended on the Germannegotiations, but perhaps, after a bit, say a week, we might see.8. I said that I regretted report which I would now have tosend to His Majosty&apos;s Government but I, above all, regretted hisaspersions on our sincerity and on military missions. As regardsthe former it was sufficient to point to the fact that starting from,say the 2nd June, when the Soviet Government presented their draft,our negotiations were one long seiues of concession after concession on our part to meet the Soviet point of view ending up withunexampled concession in agreeing to send military missions beforethe political discussions had been concluded. He said that he wasnot so much interested in the comparatively distant past as in theimmediate crowning display of insincerity. i.e., failure to answer the question of the passage of troops.9. I said that I regretted and contested this. It would heunderstandable for the Soviet negotiators to complain had our missioneither asked for an amount of assistance which it was beyond Sovietpower to give or else offered a derisory amount of assistance on thepart of Great Britain and France. In actual fact our missioifssuggestions had been that the Soviet troops should line up alongtheir own frontier for action if necessary : in other words we had asked for less than the Soviet Union was prepared to give.10. Our missions had, I said, done their utmost to get an answer to Marshal Voroshilov&apos;s question : indeed, I rather thoughtthat the French general was giving some reply to the marshal at that moment. Beminding him of what he had said about &quot;seeing ina week&apos;s time&quot; I expected assurance that we would most probablyknow the answer by then. He said &quot;we will see&quot; and on thisvague note the interview terminated.No. 92.Extract from the Speech by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in the House of Lords on August 24, 1989.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Viscount Halifax) :-*****That, in outline, was the situation when on the 22nd August, theday before yesterday, it was officially stated in Berlin and Moscowthat negotiations had been in progress, and were to be at oncecontinued, for the signature of a non-aggression pact between theSoviet Union and Germany. I do not conceal the fact that this announcement came its a surprise to His Majesty&apos;s Government.
For some time past there had been rumours of a change in therelations between the German and Soviet Governments, but no hintof such a change was conveyed by the Soviet Government to HisMajesty&apos;s Government or the French Government, with whom theywere in negotiation; and on the 31st July last the Prime Ministerremarked in another place that His Majesty&apos;s Government were showing a great degree of trust, and a strong desire to bring their negotiations with the Soviet Government to a successful issue, when,before any agreement had been finally reached on political matters, they agreed to send a Military Mission to Moscow to discuss military plans.The Military Missions of France and this country reached moscow on the 11th August, and the conversations were proceeding to allappearance on a basis of mutual confidence, and it is, I do notconceal from your Lordships, certainly disturbing to learn that while these conversations were taking place the Soviet Government weresecretly negotiating a pact with Germany for purposes which, on the face of it, were inconsistent with the objects, as we had understoodthem, of their foreign policy.I would not now pass any final judgment on this matter. Thatwould be premature until we have had time to consult with theFrench Government as to the meaning and the consequences of theagreement, the actual text of which has been published this morning,but one matter forces itself upon the immediate attention of HisMajesty&apos;s Government. They had to consider what effect thischanged situation should have on their policy. In Berlin the agree-ment was somewhat cynically welcomed as a great diplomatic victory which removed the danger of war. since, so it was alleged, GreatBritain and France would no longer fulfil their obligations to Poland,and His Majesty&apos;s Government felt it their first duty to remove thisdangerous illusion. It should be recalled, if it is not in mind, thatour guarantee to Poland was given before any agreement with Eussiawas in prospect, and without condition that such agreement should bereached. His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, at once issued astatement that their obligations to Poland and other countriesremained unaffected: and throughout these days, as noble Lords willimagine, we have been in close and constant contact with the FrenchGovernment, whose attitude is identical with our own. Our obliga-tions rest on the agreed statements which were made in this house and in another place, and which are binding. Effect is being givento them in treaties, which are in an advanced stage of negotiation,and these treaties will formally define the mutual obligations of theparties, but they neither add to nor subtract from the obligations of mutual assistance which have been already accepted.[20469]
German-Soviet Friendship and Frontier Agreement.The Government of the U.S.S.B. and the German Government,following the collapse of the former Polish State, consider it asexclusively their own task to restore peace and order in this territory and to assure to the peoples inhabiting it a peaceful existence whichwill correspond to their national characteristics. With this object inview, they have concluded the following agreement : Article 1.The Government of the U.S.S.K. anil the German Governmentestablish, as the frontier between their respective State interests inthe territory of the former Polish State, a line which is marked on(he attached map&apos; and which will be given in more detail in a supplementary protocol.Article 2.Both countries recognise as final the frontier between theirrespective State interests, as set out in Article 1, and will resist any interference with this decision on the part of other Powers.Article 3.The German Government will carry out the necessary Statereconstruction on the territory7 west of the line indicated in Article 1.and the Soviet Government on the territory east of this line.Article 4.The Government of the U.S.S.B. and the German government regard the above-mentioned reconstruction as a reliable foundation for the further development of friendly relations between theirpeoples.Article 5.This agreement is subject to ratification.

Both governments will therefore, direct their joint efforts, in agreement if necessary withother friendly Powers, to achieve this object as quickly as possible.Should, however, these efforts of both Governments proveunsuccessful, the fact will thereby be established that England andFrance bear responsibility for the continuation of the war; in thisease the Governments of Germany and the U.S.S.R. will consult together as to the measures it may be necessary to take.Moscow, September 28, 1989.Letter from M. Molotov to flerr von Ribbentrop.Referring to our negotiations, we have the honour to confirm toyou that the Government of the U.S.S.B., basing itself on and in thespirit of the general political agreement reached by us, is actuated bythe will to develop, by all means, economic relationship and exchangeof goods between the U.S.S.R. and Germany. With this object inview, an economic programme will be drawn up by both parties,under which the Soviet Union will supply raw materials to Germany,in exchange for which Germany, on her part, will supply industrialgoods produced over a lengthy period. Both parties will thus draw up this economic programme, in order that the German-Sovietexchange of goods should in volume again reach the highest pointattained in the past.Both Governments will issue at once the necessary orders for thepassing of the measures indicated above, and will ensure that negotiations are entered into and brought to a conclusion as soon aspossible.Moscow, September 28, 1989.No. 94.Estonian-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pad of September 28,  1989.*The Supreme Council of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicsand the President of the Republic of Estonia, having decided todevelop the friendly relations which were established by the peace treaty signed on the 2nd February. 1920, and which are founded on* Similar treaties were concluded by the Soviet Union with Latvia and lithuania.
