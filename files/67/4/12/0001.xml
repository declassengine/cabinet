THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT .SECRET. COPY NO ..1. . .W.P.(G) (40)12.WAR CABINET.political Situation in Australia.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.I think that my colleagues will &quot;be interested tosee the accompanying extract from a despatch which Ihave just received from the United Kingdom High commissioner in Australia regarding the present political situationin the Commonwealth and, more particularly, the positionof the Commonwealth Prime Minister.Subsequent Press Reports indicate that negotiations for a coalition with the Country partyhave since been initiated.A. E.Dominions Office,17th January, 1940.

The first four paragranhs summarizc a debate in the Commonwealth Parliament in the eourss of whichtho Cotrmo;. - a&quot; ;-r COYernmcr/fc -* - -: -Hod to make a concession to the^ Cppesi tier, in re g s rd to the rates of pay of the Australian military forces,      The despatchthen continues; -5.      Though Mr, Menaies has extricated himself as well as possible from an awkward situation,  the fact remains that the Government has been forced for thesecond time in a few days to make humiliating concessions on a question of first-class political importance      Itis true that both the humiliation and the concessionshave been more than shared by the Country Party, whoseleader has each time been driven to beat a hasty retreatfrom an indefensible position originally taken up for him by his supporters.      Nevertheless it is clear that thGovernment cannot continue indefinitely to submit toblackmail by threats of suicide,  and that between now and october next, when a general election is in any case due,Mr. Menzies may be forced to choose between putting anend to an intolerable situation by going to the country or by taking the Country Party into the Government.6.      The objection to the first of these courses,as the Prime Minister himself frankly admitted to me, isthe risk of a Labour victory.      I regret to say that of late there has been a marked deterioration in theofficial Labour attitude to the war.      Prom the beginningthe Labour policy has been open to the gibe of being,in the words of an article in the fSydney Morning Herald&apos;one of &quot;cheering on the   Allies from the sidelines andat the safe distance of 18,000 miles&quot;.      Since then ithas developed into what the same paper describes as&quot;a

&quot;a near neutrality policy of keeping Australia out of active participation in the war&quot;.      The lengths to whichthis policy is now carried are illustrated by the enclosed cartoon in the Sydney &quot;Pally News1, the officialorgan of the party3 which In effect amounts to thesuggestion that it is wrong for Australia to send a force overseas because some of them may get hurt.      Iam convinced, and the Prime Minister shares my opinion,that this does not represent the views cf the vast majority of the rank and file of the Labour movement, or indeed of its accredited leader, Mr.  Curtin, who hasthroughout expressed himself on the subject in moderateand carefully guarded terms.      as, however,  I haveelsewhere reported,  it is unfortunately the case thatthe Labour Parliamentary Party is tied and bound bythe decisions of the party caucus on which, as is notunusual, left-wing extremists are greatly over-represented,  and I fear that the immediate result ofa Labour victory at a general election would be thedestruction of national unity and a serious moralset-back to the Allied cause,Vi      The obstacles to the second course,  that ofa new coalition between the United Australia Party andthe Country Party, are almost entirely personal.Mr. Menzies has a hereditary feud v/ith the Country Party;it would hardly be possible for him to sit in the sameCabinet as Sir Earle Page after the latter&apos;s bitter and repeated attacks on him;    and he has a complete intellec-tual contempt for Mr. Cameron.      It is not impossible,however, that he may in the end be forced by the pressure of events to solve his difficulties oyenlarging the basis of his government,  and it is significant that so strong and influential a supporterof

of the Government as the &apos; Sydney Morning Herald&apos; has expressedthe opinion that negotiations to this end ought not to be delayed.8.   Apart from putting an end to the constant haemorrhageof prestige from which the Government iii existing circumstancesis suffering, a coalition with the Country Party would havethe effect of infusing a much needed dose of new blood.There is no doubt that the present Cabinet, with the exceptionof the Prime Minister, are not an impressive body;    in thisrespect they have disappointed my earlier hopes;    and thePrime Minister himself suffers conspicuously from a lack of popular appeal.      The suspicion attaching to &quot;cleverness&quot; inEngland becomes downright dislike- in Australia;    and inaddition Mr. Mensies, though on his day and to an educatedaudience one of the best speakers in the Empire,  strikes a falsenote whenever he attempts to appeal to a wider audience, as forexample over the wireless, which in this country is inevitably his main medium of contact with the masses.    Froman intellectual point of view Mr. Menzies has all the qualifications of a great Prime Minister, but beneath the petty personal squabbles and jealousies which I havefrequently reported,  there does lie a general and, I am afraid, not altogether unjustified,  opinion that he isdeficient in the temperament of a War Minister.9.     A gooddeal of the Government1s difficulties are ofcourse due, as I imagine is the case in England also,  tothe unexpected character of the war,  and would vanish assoon as it became clear to the people of Australia that in1939, no less than in 1914,  the United Kingdom,  and with itthe

the whole Commonwealth, was fighting for its life. &apos;   Atpresent that is not the case.    In my account of Australia1sentry into the war, I concluded with the words:    &quot;i-or thetime toeing the war is very far away.      It will come nearer&quot;.Up to the present,  it has, if anything, receded.
