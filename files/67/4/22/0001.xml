DELAYS TO SHIPPING DUE TO COjjTgaBAjg) CONTROLI INTRODUCTORYOn the 16th Januury I submitted to the &apos;7ar Cabi-a-ta Memorandum in which I dealt with the need for increasing our programme of merchant shipbuilding (paper No. W, P. (^jO)ll).This was in effect the first portion of my report on thepresent shipping position on which, at their Meeting heldon 22nd December 1939 (W.?&apos;. (39) 122nd Conclusions, Minute 2),I was invited by the War Cabinet to carry out a survey.    Inthe last ten days I have been * iving special attention, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, to the questionof Contraband Control in the dearing which it has to theproblem of shipping delays.    At the same time I have beeninvestigating from a similar standpoint the question ofchartering neutral tonnage and the efficacy of our presentmachinery to secure this end when we are engaged in negotiating War Trade agreements.    The first of these rpaestionsappears to me so urgent tnat o. have thought it right to subv-dtthe present report without delay.The second question is also one of great importance and 1propose to deal with it in a special report which I hope tosubmit in the near future.ii.    STAFFING PROBLEMS IN COUNECTIOKWITH &quot;COITORABAIfl) CONTROL.2. Contraband control is necessarily highly distastefulto neutrals, and it is therefore particularly important thatthe arrangements for carrying it out should reach the highest possible level of efficiency.    Not only do delays to shippinggive rise to very heavy claims for compensation on account ofdemurrage, etc. , but they also re-act to a wholly disproportion-ate degree on our relations with foreign Governments.    I am-1-

convinced therefore that the staffing arrangements fordealing with this question should,  if anything, err on the side of lavishness rather than the reverse.    This may seemat first sight a relatively trivial matter to &quot;bring to thenotice of the War Cabinet, but it is in fact I am convincedone of capital importance.3. I have discussed the matter in detail both with theMinister of Economic Warfare, who is primarily concerned,and also with a representative of the Foreign Office,since the latter department is concerned also in so faras work on contraband control falls to be performed inconsular establishments abroad.(a)    The permitted rate of recruitment and the.metKod&apos; renuired to&apos; be &quot;followed.4. Like other war departments brought into existencelast September,  the Ministry of Economic Warfare was required to spring into full vigour at a moment&apos;s notice.The    degree to which the Ministry succeeded in doing sois a remarkable testimony to the ability and energy ofthose charged with its preliminary organisation, but none the less it must be admitted that at no time duringits existence has the staff at the Ministry been sufficientto deal with its current work.    Constant increases of staff have been approved and additional personnel appointed, but nevertheless this has not been sufficient to wipe offpast arrears or altogether to prevent fresh arrears fromarising.    In peace time we should all agree that it wouldbe wrong for a Government Department to be allowed toengaged staff until the need for such staff has been clearlyestablished.    In war time, however, and especially in thecase of a department whose work is so closely bound up with commercial activities of all kinds, I feel that this

criterion should not he applied too rigidly.    What isrequired is that the Ministry should he . iven a provision.!establishment sufficient in all grades not only to dealwith current work,  including the wiping off of arrears,hut also to ensure (i) that in future cases may hedisposed of with the utmost possible despatch, and (:l:v)that at all times there is a margin of trained staffimmediately available in the Ministry to be drafted to anybranch where fresh developments may require an increase in personnel.5. In so far as the higher staff is concerned, theMinistry of Economic Warfare, like other GovernmentDepartments,  is required at present to look for candidatesin the first instance through the Central Register established in the Ministry of Labour.    The Minister of economic warfare has stated to me most categorically - and, as Iam convinced, with justification - that whatever may be tiemerits of this system of recruitment for ordinaryGovernment departments it is inappropriate for a depart..-:oatsuch as his.    He has found that the Register does not contain the names of persons possessing qualifications of the t \ 2which he requires, and that frequently persons whose namesare supplied by the Central Register are either not available through having obtained other employment or do not in factpossess the qualifications stated,    I think that there is great force in this arpunent, and I reeoomend that the rule in regard to the Central Register should be materiallyrelaxed for the purpose of recruiting the specialisedhigher staff required for the Ministry of Economic Warfare.(b)   Grading of staff at the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare.6. For reasons to those discussed above, theMinister of Economic Warfare considers that the work of

his department could he expedited if a more liberalinterpretation were given to the rules governing the grading ofparticular classes of staff.      I think that there isconsiderable force in this argument in view both of the natureof the work of the department and of the fact that so large a percentage of the personnal concerned consists of temporary staff recruited from outside the public service.Already, as I am assured by the Minister, the insistence onthe maintenance of rigid Civil Service grading, has resultedin the resignation of a number of highly efficient temporaryemployees, whose services are urgently needed, immediately the men in question could find better paid employment elsewhere.(c) Rates of salary.7. Another cause which has led to difficulty in recruitingfor the Ministry of Economic Warfare and has consequentlyled to delays in its work is the insistence on the rule thattemporary staff should be paid at the same rates as permanent staff, notwithstanding the fact that they have no permanentposition and do not enjoy the prospective rights tosuperannuation benefits possessed by permanent officials.I realise that rules of this kind are intended for general application throughout the public service, but neverthelessI think that there is great force in the argument that abetter and more efficient staff could be recruited, especiallyin the lower grades, if those appointed to temporary postswere given salaries slightly higher than those given to permanent civil servants engaged on similar work.8. Similarly, the insistence in many cases not only thattenrporary entrants should receive only the rates applicableto permanent civil servants but also that they should enterat the minimum of the scale constitutes a further factoradversely affecting the recruitment of an efficient temporary staff.-k-

(d) Staff -problems in Consular offices.9. The bulk of the work required to be done abroad inconnection with the contraband control is performed in Britishconsular establishments.     Here again the low rates of salary-offered and the general rigidity of the system imposed -quite rightly no doubt in time of peace - has led to difficulties in recruiting the staff     required andconsequently to dela.ys in the despatch of business.     Inthe case of American countries, these delays have been suchas to make it necessary to issue Navicerts after only themost cursory examination of the evidence submitted and on a scale far more generous than would be justified if adequatestaff were available.     The representative of the ForeignOffice who was present when this matter was discussed, urgedvery strongly on behalf of the Secretary of State thatpermission should be given for a relaxation of the present regulations, in order to secure the staff so urgently required.(e) Security measures in the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare/10. Certain portions of the work of the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare are of as secret a nature and of as greatan interest to the enemy as those dealt with in any department of State.     Nevertheless at the present time thedifficulties of recruiting staff to which I have referred are so great that it has not at present been found possible toensure that persons working on such questions are vouched for as thoroughly reliable by the appropriate security organisation.      I am strongly of the opinion that steps tothis end should be taken as soon as possible both as regardsexisting staff and also in the case of new entrants.     Ido not suggest that the.appointment of the latter should beheld up for this purpose, but I consider that no new entrantshould be given access to matters of exceptional seci-ecy after their appointment until their personal qualifications have-5-

been vouched for in the manner indicated .abo-Ill,  COKUUNIOATIQNS,11. Under the existing arrangements telegrams to and from foreign posts in   sonncr-iic:: with contraband control arehandled on behalf of the Ministry of Economic Warfare by theForeign Office.      The majority of these telegrams arc either in v/holc or in part transmitted in cipher and have therefore to be ciphered or deciphered,  as the case may bo. in theForeign Office before they coo-: bo further handled.     Thevolume of the telegrams in question is very considerable, and,I am informed by the Foreign Office, is considerably larger than that of the whole of the normal Foreign Of face telegramsput together.      The result of this arrangement has led to veryconsiderable delays especially in the deciphering of incomingtelegrams, since, as is only natural, priority is given inthe Foreign Office Gommunicat Loxis Department to the decipheringof urgent telegrams dealing with strictly political problem?12. The Minister of Economic Warfare and, I -understandalso the Foreign Office,  are of the opinion that delays in the handling of economic r/Warfare telegrams will not be eliminateduntil the Ministry of Economic Warfare is provided with theirown Communications Department equipped for ciphering anddeciphering their own telegrams,      Further, even within theexisting scheme, full advantage was until recently not talienof the facilities availablee     That is to say, there was nota   continuous ^three-shift system at work at the Foreign office in the ciphering and deciphering of telegrams, and, in addition,the arrangements for the Uo,^c&quot;!io  of telegrams fromthe Foreign Office to the Ministry of Economic Warfareafter they had been deciphered wore inadequate, only three or four messenger deliveries dally being provided.      I amof the opinion that the Ministry of Economic Warfareshould be permitted to assume the full responsibilityfor the ciphering and deciphering of their own-6-

telegrams, though I raaJUs^^lmt^ un4^.. fu^is provided such an arrangement will not he practicable.It will be appreciated that though the adoption of thisproposal would involve some increase in the total number ofstaff engaged at the Foreign Office and Ministry of economic warfare together, the new arrangement would not involve the doubling of the present staff, since some at least of theexisting Foreign Office staff could, and no doubt should,be transferred to the Ministry of Economic Warfare,,13,       The Minister of Economic Warfare and the assistant chief of the Naval Staff (who was deputed by the First lord to discuss this matter with me) have represented very strongly that, in order to reduce the delays in the contrabandstations themselves, the proper course would be to introduceteleprinters at each such station,,      I am certainly of theopinion that every modern technical device of this kind should be taken advantage of in order to speed up this important work.IV.      ACCOMMODATION-14.       I have discussed-above the difficulties confrontingthe Minister of Economic Warfare in the matter of staff, butthere is another aspect of the same question which requiresurgent attention also     This is the extreme shortage of accommodation allotted.to his Department with the consequentovercrowding, loss of efficiency, and delay in the transaction of business.15.       The Minister of Economic Warfare informs- me that theFirst Commissioner of Works is endeavouring to find alter-native accommodation capable- of housing the whole of his department but, as I can readily appreciate, the difficulties are very great.     It seems to me that in the case of thisDepartment the provision of adequate accommodation has suchan important bearing on the speed with which its work can be despatched that, if no other solution can be found the-7-

A; 3Government should give serious consideration to thepossibility of allotting to the Ziinistry^QtLEcanonic&quot;nw-arf--r-a-accommodation at present occupied hy some GovernmentDepartment of approximately comparable size engaged on worknot bearing so directly on our war effort0     I realise thatthe adoption of this recommendation would c ause greatinconvenience to whatever the Department concerned might be,but, bearing in mind the sacrifice made on a similar occasionby the President of the Board of Education, I do not feelthat the difficulties should necessarily be insurmountable0Vo    DELAYS TO SHIPPING IN CONTRABANDJONTRC iT STATIONS s16.       The Minister of Economic Warfare informs me that,subject to tho qualifications noted below, the a&apos; erageperiod of detention in the control stations at Pamsgats andWeymouth fell during the first four months of the war tothe extent shown below:-Average period of detention JLn daysPMontho Rams gat e0 Weymouth0September 1109 11October 10o6 9November ?024 11December 601 736The average period of detention at Kirkwall has beenmaterially reduced consequent upon the signature of the war trade Agreement with Sweden, and amounted in December to508 daysc     The figures given above do not cover the periodsspent by ships carrying cargoes to be seized while the shipsconcerned are in the ports to which they have to be divertedfor that purpose.17e       While the foregoing figures show a considerable improvement, the Minister of Economic Warfare considers - andi agree - that the delays shou&quot;&apos;1 be otill further reducedoThe recent opening of alternative bases at Falmouth and

Cromarty may be expected to as^is-t-ojo^tbAs^di _______the situation should.- I think, be carefully watched, and inso far as technical facilities are available it may wellbe found desirable in the light of experience to increasestill further the number of alternative bases,VIo    THE EXAMINATION 0? MAILSo180       I am satisfied that the examination of mails is not an element in the delays to shipping;, since under the procedure adopted, mails are reoiovoo from the ship in which theyarrive, are despatched to Liverpool for censoring and arethen forwarded to their destination by the next availableship.     Thus the censoring cf mails causes delay to the mailsonly and not to the ships In which they are carried-,VII o    THE DISSEMINATION OP INjTOKMATION REO/RDING19.       Steps have already been taken by the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare to issue in certain countries pamphletsexplaining concisely the steps v/hich shippers should take in order to ensure the minimum of delay to consignments whichthey may despatch^     This arrangements has, however, as yetnot been carried out systematically or universally.- and i recommend that steps should be taken as soon as possible toensure in every country that explanatory pamphlets of thiskind are available for issue to all concerned0VIIIo SUMMARY OP PRINCIPAL, CONCLUSIONS ANDRECplaAElfoATIONS I20.       I summarise my principal conclusions as follows:-(a)(i) To a considerable extent the delay in operatingcontraband control with the conseouent heavyclaims for compensation from shipowners and the ill-will and friction created with neutral countries is dwe to the inadequacy of thepresent staffing arrangements at the Ministryof Economic Warfare? and to the rigidity withwhich the peace-time rules governing the recruitment of temporary staff and the gradingand rates of pay permitted have been, and stillare being, applied in the case of that--&apos;9*j

Departmento     The same considerations apply-to the recruitment for contraband controlwork of temporary staffs in the Consularestablishment abroad,,(ii) Having regard to the exceptional circumstancesof the Ministry of Economic Warfare, the normalrules governing the recruitments grading and pay of temporary staff should be relaxed tosecure the highest standard of efficiency inthe Departmento(b) (1) Unnecessary and avoidable delay in the workof the Ministry of Economic Warfare is causedby the fact that , as at present arranged,that Ministry has no Communications Departmentof its own and is forced to rely -for   theciphering and deciphering of its telegramsupon the machinery available in the ForeignOffice, v/hich naturally and rightly givesprecedence in such matters to the many urgenttelegrams dealing with strictly ForeignOffice matterso     Avoidable delay is alsocaused by the lack of teleprinters at the contraband control stations,,(ii) As soon as accommodation is available, theMinistry of Economic Warfare should be allowedto establish their own CommunicationsDepartment in order to deal with their owntelegrams.     Teleprinters shall be suppliedas required.(c) (i) The office accommodation at present providedfor the Ministry of Economic Warfare is whollyinadequate, and has led to overcrowding, lossof efficiency, and delay in the transactionof urgent Government business,(ii) The most serious effort should be made to secureadequate accommodation for the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare, to the extent (if necessary)of serious consideratio n being given to thepossibility of allotting to the Ministryaccommodation now occupied by some Departmentengaged on work not so immediately connectedwith our War effort.(d) During ,the first four months of the war therehas been a progressive reduct.i on in the delaysto shipping at the contraband   control stations and the recent opening of alternative bases at Falmouth and Cromarty may be expected to afford still further improvement0     Theposition should, however, be carefully watched, to determine in the light of experience whether further reductions indelay ooudd be effected by an increase in thenumber of alternative bases.(e) The censoring of mails causes delay to the mailsbut not to the ships in which they are carried.

n r* ft(f)    Steps should he taken as soon as possible toextend to all countries the arrangementsalready made in the case of some countries by which pamphlets are mario. availableto all concerned, setting out concisely the steps which shippers and otheis shouldtake in order ro reduce delay to a minimum.SI.       Many of the matters discussed above are themselvesrelatively trivial, but in the aggregate they havea very important bearing on the efficiency of the Ministryof Economic Warfare0     It would, I think, be an advantage in the case of this Department if the WarCabinet were to delegate to one of its members the dutyof keeping a special watch on such matters, on linessimilar to those by which a general duty of supervisionhas been entrusted to the Minister without Portfolioin matters connected with oil supplies.(Intld.)
