------------ - -secret.P.(G)(40) 23. EAR^cabinet Copy No. /pINDIA; SITUATION IN WA.r/.IRISTANMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIAReference has been made in the Fortnightly Reports tqthe disturbed conditions in certain parts of Waziristan andin the adjoining British territory.    In Waziristan itself the position has recently been eased; the Mahsud tribe hasco-operated in securing the return of Major Duggal, anofficer of the Indian Medical Service, held by one of theirsections, and the Bhitanni tribe (to the east of theMahsuds), against whom air action had been in progress onaccount of their participation in raids, has made itssubmission.   In Bannu District, however, the situation hasbeen increasingly bad, the latest incidents being the raidon the civil hospital in Bannu City and the attack onregular troops mentioned in the last Fortnightly Report: andthe Government of India have had drastic measures for dealirgwith it under their urgent consideration.I attach a telegram from the Government of India,from which it will be seen that the centre of this trouble is an area of North Waziristan, outside the administeredborder, which forms a salient extending eastward betweenthe Bannu and Kohat districts of British India, and is called the Ahmadzai Salient.   The Government of India, apartfrom other measures which they have under consideration,ask for immediate sanction for the military occupation ofthis area and the construction of roads and posts therein.The object of this action, which would be similar to measureswhich have been taken in other parts of Waziristan and

elsewhere, would be to deprive hostile gangs of the use ofthe area as a base for raids and to prevent the spread of trouble from Waziristan to other tribal areas further north.   The Government of India contemplate that it would eventually be controlled by Civil Forces.    It would not,however, be included in British India.There can be no doubt that the area has played animportant part in the deterioration of the situation inBannu District, as it has provided a ready asylum foroffenders from administered territory and a close andconvenient base of operations for trans-border gangsters.The area is barren and badly watered, but it lies inclose proximity to Bannu City; it flanks for severalmiles the Bannu-Kohat road at close range and it alsoconstitutes a perpetual raiding threat to the neighbouringarea of the Kohat District to the north.    There is verylittle settled population, but the area includes some ofthe winter grazing grounds of sections of Wazirs whose main habitat is further to the west in Waziristan.   Theseare not the people who have been giving us trouble in theAhmadzai salient but our taking over the area may giverise to some opposition on their part.There can, I think, be little doubt that the views which the Government of India have formed as to therequirements of the situation should be accepted inprinciple on the assumption that they are satisfied thattheir proposal will not involve any undue risk of leading to further trouble elsewhere in Waziristan.    I amaccordingly informing them that on this assumption their proposal is sanctioned in principle,  subject to furtherconsideration of the following subsidiary points:  -

INDIA OFFICE.27th January, 1940.(a) I am doubtful as to the expediency of sodetailed a public announcement as they propose, if itcan be avoided;(b) Although the area is well away from theAfghan Frontier and indeed is to the east of the Thal-Mir Ali Road which we already occupy, it will, I think,be desirable, having regard to the special importanceof our relations with the Afghan Government at this juncture and the interest which they are known to take in matters at all affecting the tribes on either sideof the common frontier, to inform them as soon aspossible in advance of the proposed operation ratherthan at the last moment as proposed by the Governmentof India.These points will therefore be further consideredwith the Government of India and with the Minister atKabul as regards informing the Afghan Government.Z.

SECRETTELEGRAM from the Government of India, External AffairsDepartment, to the Secretary of State for India,dated 24th January, 1940.220Addressed to Secretary of State for India, repeated to Kabul, 41, and North West Frontier Province by post.You will have gathered from Weightman1s reportsthat there has beendeterioration of the situation inWaziristan and on Bannu Dera Jat Border.   Capture ofDuggal added to general excitement of the tribes by warrumours, called for stringent air action against ShabiKhels and Bhitanni country, with reaction that raidingactivities were intensified.   There were serious clashesbetween large raiding gangs and Government forces (bothtroops and irregulars) and a very daring raid on hospitalwithin Bannu City.   Schools and other public buildings have been burnt.   Bannu Ahmadzai Salient has been increasingly used as harbourage for gangs reinforced byother tribes including Mahsuds and constitutes standingthreat to Bannu and Kohat districts,   peculiar importanceof this area lies in the fact that it is most northerlyoutpost of Wazir tribes so that failure to control it maylead to deterioration of the situation further north.2.        Statistics show that casualties among regulartroops and civil armed forces during 1939 amounted to77 killed and 195 wounded while in the last seven monthsthere have been 1,075 offences committed by tribesmenincluding 166 kidnappings and 7 air operations.3.        Situation has been considerably eased by the surrender of Duggal without payment of ransom throughefforts of Iwahsud Maliks of all sections except the ShabiKhel, showing that Mahsud tribe as a whole refuse to

follow the Shabi Khel into hostilities against theGovernment.   Bh it arm is moreover have now surrendered alltheii captives and air proscription of their country hasbeen called off.   But raiding, particularly in theneighbourhood of Bannu and from Ahmadzai salient,continues and districts are out of hand.4.        We think it matter of the utmost importance to stabilise the situation during the remaining months ofthe cold weather to ensure that disorders do not spread to the north and to apply the necessary force before weare faced with larger commitments.5.        To this end we have still further reviewed thesituation in consultation with our military advisers andour Foreign Secretary has discussed with the Governor atPeshawar.    It is agreed that the most urgent objective isoccupation on a permanent footing of Ahmadzai Salient toremove threat to Bannu and insulate Waziristan troubles.Area is surrounded by easy terrain on all sides and canbe separated from remainder of Waziristan.   Objectivewould be secured by occupation by troops, construction of roads and posts in the territory and subsequent transferof control to civil forces as has been done in KhajurlPlain and Loi Agra.   Essence of scheme is that occupationshould be permanent and we are inclined to think public announcement should be made to that effect.    It should bepossible to accompany occupation with measure of disarmament but it is not proposed to include area inBritish India.   We can make 2 Brigades available for operation and propose to raise 16 new platoons of FrontierConstabulary to take over the area patrol.   Some strength-thening of Scouts on Spinwam line will probably be needed in addition.   Addition to civil forces will be on atemporary basis as war commitment only.

&apos;) fi 96.     We think that, although salient is in advance ofThai-Mir Ali road, there would be advantage simultaneously with public announcement in informing Afghan Governmentof our intentions.7.     Further measures will be needed to secureco-ordination in districts between civil and militarydirection and forces and to deal with ingress of raidingparties of Mahsuds through Bhitanni country in territoryfurther south.   We are also considering the need forspecial powers to restore order in the districts and prevent villagers from rendering aid to tribesmen.   TheShabi Khel position moreover is not yet clear and thereis a heavy bill for damages against that tribe.   these points however will be examined at conference whichViceroy proposes to call in Delhi at early date.   We asknow for immediate sanction in principle to occupation ofAhmadzai Salient.   Operations cannot begin for at least15 days after sanction is given and Governor stressesimportance of time factor both for the restoration ofconfidence and to take advantage of remainder of coldweather.   Terrain lies low and water is scarce, so that military, operations in hot season are impracticable.
