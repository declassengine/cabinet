THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.SECRET Copy. No.W.P. (G.) (40) 5.WAR CABINET.OLD AGE PENSIONS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I AM sorry at this time to &quot;have to ask my colleagues to give urgent consideration to&apos;the difficult and complicated subject of old age,pensions. Thequestion has, however, received great prominence in the House of commons during the last six months and the Government have had to promise some indication of their proposals as soon as the House meets on the 16th January.Moreover, before that date. I must again meet representatives of the T.U.C.and, if possible, indicate concrete proposals which we are prepared to consider.2. It will probably be agreed that in the field of social service there is nodemand which has in recent months received more support both in the Houseof Commons and in the country than the demand to improve old age pensions.The Prime Minister had promised an enquiry before the war and in the middleof September had explained that the outbreak of war had made it impossible tocomplete the enquiry. Nevertheless, there was repeated demand in the house for action by the Government, and with the Prime Ministers approval I promised,on the 1st November, that the enquiry would be resumed.3. The question of old age pensions is one of particular difficulty, partly because the financial circumstances of the 3,000,000 old age pensioners vary sogreatly, and partly because any improvement in the scheme is not only costly atthe present time but becomes increasingly costly throughout the next 25 years.Moreover, the question is now complicated by the rise in the cost of living. Inthe case of an insurance scheme under which contributions and benefits relate to approximately the same period, it is possible to raise contributions in order tomeet a temporary rise in the scale of benefits. This, however, is not possible inthe case of old age pensions where the contributions are spread over a period of50 years. Any increase in benefits dependent upon increased contributions must,therefore, be permanent in character and any temporary improvement to meetwar-time conditions must, I suggest, be dealt with outside the main contributoryscheme. if4. Old age pensions do not form part of what may be termed the basicsocial services -that is, the services which provide ultimate means of subsistencefor those without any other resources. No Government has ever claimed thatthe old age pension is sufficient for the maintenance of a pensioner who hasno other resources whatever. In this way it is different from unemployment assistance and public assistance, where scales have to be raised to meet anysubstantial rise in the cost of living. For at least three centuries the aged poorhave looked to local sources to meet their ultimate needs, and Public AssistanceCommittees are required by law to meet such needs and prevent destitutionwhatever may be the age of the pensioner or the cost of living.   There is.[20605] b
therefore, in theory, no reason why the Government should introduce any changein the system of old age pensions because of the outbreak of war or the risein the cost of living.5. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that public opinion has moved in thelast 30 years in the direction of regarding the rate of pension as the amount which is required in the majority of cases to meet the needs of old age pensioners and there can, I think, be no doubt that political considerations demand some action by the Government at the present time.6. I have, in the enclosed memorandum, attempted to set out shortly thefacts of the case and to examine various possible methods of approaching theproblem. My final conclusions, as contained in Section IX, may not be veryacceptable and may not earn us much gratitude in the country. Nevertheless,I feel that these proposals are the most we can afford to contemplate at the presenttime. None of us knows what the future holds in store, and if the war lasts forseveral years we shall be fortunate if we can come through without a substantialdiminution in the standard of our social services, and, indeed, in the generalstandard of living in the country, which might well take many years of peaceto repair. It would, in my view, be most unwise at this stage for the Governmentto launch a scheme for the general improvement of contributory old age pensionsby raising the flat rate, though we might express the hope that, if the waris brought to a successful conclusion without leaving the country too impoverished,we should then be able to propose more far-reaching improvements.7. The proposals in the memorandum have been discussed with the Ministerof Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland. In the time available it hasnot been possible to agree with them all the details which are set out in thememorandum, but I understand that they are in general agreement with themain proposals which the memorandum contains.J.

Recent History.1. The Prime Minister, in the course of a Debate on old age pensions onthe 27th July last, said : &quot; We have decided ourselves to undertake without delay an investiga-tion into these matters.  We intend to collect the information which we feelis required;. we shall ascertain, in the recognised fashion, the views of thosewho would be contributors;. and we shall thus put ourselves in the positionto decide what improvements or modifications may be possible.2.   Preliminary investigations into the matter were made by officials duringthe first fortnight of August, but when their report was received Ministers were fully pre-occupied with the international position, and in reply to questions onthe 13th September the Prime Minister said he regretted that the international situation in August and the subsequent outbreak of war had made it impossiblefor the Government to complete the intended investigation.   He added :  &quot; I am afraid that in this great emergency the question of any general increase in the rate of old age pensions must remain in abeyance for the time. This reply did not satisfy the House of Commons for long, and theGovernment had to agree to a full Debate on the subject on the 1st November.During that Debate, with the Prime Minister&apos;s agreement, I promised that theGovernment would resume the investigation which had been promised in July,and would immediately get into touch with representatives of contributors, i.e.,the employers and workers. I made it plain that in the present financial positionof the country any improvement in the scheme of contributory pensions must rest almost entirely on the extent to which additional contributions could be paid,but I promised that if, with the agreement of the contributors, we were able toimprove the benefits under the contributory pensions scheme, the Exchequer would find the money for an equivalent improvement in the scales of benefit for non-contributory pensioners.4. Following that speech, T immediately got into touch with the T.U.C. andthe National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations. I have had two meetings with representatives of the T.U.C., one on the 15th November and one on the 21st December. I have also had a meeting with representatives of theNational Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations on the 23rd November. Atall these discussions the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland were either present themselves or were represented.5. At the last meeting with the T.U.C., I promised that I would againget in touch with the Employers, and would then arrange a further meeting withbeing.&quot;the T.U.C.[20605]b 2
II. -Present Scheme.6. The present scheme of old age pensions is complicated largely because ofthe mingling of the contributory and the non-contributory elements. There isattached as appendix A an extract from the Government Actuary&apos;s recent reporton the subject, which gives an account of the existing scheme.7. It will be seen that next year contributory pensions will cost over 85 million, of which the Exchequer will find  50 million, or nearly 60 per cent.,in addition to finding over  14i million for non-contributory pensions. If thescheme is not changed, the excess of expenditure over income falling on the Exchequer for contributory pensions alone will rise by  15 millionwithin 5 years, and will thereafter steadily increase. It will also be seenthat (even on the basis which has always been accepted of charging ascontributions to both parties jointly no more than could be rightly expectedon an actuarial basis from the contributor alone entering the scheme at 16 andpaying contributions throughout working life), the present level of contributionsis far lower than might properly have been fixed. Indeed, for the present scheme the full actuarial contributions for an entrant aged 16 would be about Is. Qd.a week for men and 9f/. for women instead of the present lid. (rising to Is. 3d.by 1956) and b\d. (rising to 1\d. by 1956).8. At the middle of 1939 there were about 2.920.000 pensioners over the ageof 65 in Great Britain. Of these. 1.060.000 were between the ages of 65 and 70and 1.860,000 over 70. Of the latter. 1.290.000 were drawing their pensions by virtue of their contributions and without any test of means. In the case of men.nearly 80 per cent, of those over 70 were drawing their pensions by virtue ofcontributions.III.  Local A uthorities.9. Since the Poor Law was established in this country the aged and infirmhave ultimately been a charge on local resources. The Government pensions schemes as they have been introduced have relieved Local Authorities of part oftheir financial responsibilities, but it has never been claimed by any Governmentthat the old age pension was sufficient for a pensioner without other resources.Nevertheless, Local Authorities have complained to an increasing extent in recentyears of the burden involved in supplementing old age pensions, and last march the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland had a specialreturn prepared to shown the magnitude of this supplementation. Those returnswere published in the Official Report of the House of Commons on the 6th April,and showed that the number of old age pensioners to whom out relief in money and kind was granted during the week ending the 11th March was 276.534. Itwas estimated that the annual cost of such relief to old age pensioners and their dependants was in the region of  5.270,000. The average weekly supplementa-tion in cases wrhere it was given was therefore between 7s. and 8s. a week. Thecost was equivalent to about a Ad. rate on an average in England and Wales ando\d. in Scotland. Approximately 10 per cent, of old age pensioners in Englandand Wales received such out relief and about 14 per cent, in Scotland, thepercentage for the whole country being about 10^ per cent.10. Local Authorities in administering this out relief adopt a family needstest and require contributions from sons and daughters who are able to maintain their aged parents. The standard of administration no doubt varies considerablyas between one Local Authority and another. In some areas it is understoodthat supplementation of pensions is almost automatic, whereas in other areasa very strict standard is enforced.IV.  Views of the Trades Union Congress.11. Before the war the T.U.C. supported the Labour Party&apos;s pensions scheme which sought to provide  1 a week for a single person and 35s. a week for a married couple for all over the age of 65 provided they retired fromgainful occupation : it also provided a pension for a wife aged 55 or over assoon as her husband reached 65, and increased allowances for widows, children
and orphans. The additional cost (i.e., the cost over and above the cost of thepresent old age pension scheme, already amounting to  100 million per annum)was estimated to be about  80 million per annum at the present time rising to about  90 million at the end of 10 years.12. When [ saw the representatives of the T.U.C. on the 15th Novemberit was agreed that our discussions should be treated as confidential. Theyindicated that in view of war conditions they were prepared to modify theproposals in La hour&apos;s pension plan and they suggested that we should aim atan all round increase of 5s. for all pensioners aged 65 and over. They also suggested that pensions of 15*. a week should be paid to wives and insuredwomen from the age of 60 upwards. They recognised the difficulty of makingthe existing pension dependent upon retirement from industry, but suggestedthat such a condition should be attached to receipt of the new benefits. they said that if the Government proposed a scheme on those lines they would beprepared to recommend contributors to find, on the part of employers and workersjointly, contributions equivalent to half the additional cost. They felt that theremaining half, as well as the whole cost of the equivalent rise in non-contributory pensions, should be borne by the Exchequer.13. The Government Actuary examined these proposals from a financialangle and the Ministry of Health examined the possibility, from an adminis-trative point of view, of enforcing the retirement condition. Both theirmemoranda were circulated to the T.IJ.C. before our meeting on the21st December.14. The Ministry of Health memorandum made it clear that the adminis-trative difficulties of enforcing a retirement condition were very great, and itmight be assumed that the cost of enforcement would approximate to the saving-effected.15. The Government Actuary&apos;s Report showed that the gross cost of theT.U.C. proposals (i.e., the cost over and above the cost of the present old age pension schemes, already amounting to  100 million per annum, but excluding any problematic savings clue to their proposed retirement condition) would beabout  53-4 million next year rising to  72-3 million in 1965. of which thenon-contributory element would be  7-2 million and  6-6 million respectively.On the basis of fixing contributions by relation to the value of the additional benefits to a new entrant at the age of 16, it would be necessary to increase theman&apos;s contribution from 11 r/. to Is. M. and the woman&apos;s from b\d. to Is. 3d. Onthis basis, the Exchequer would bear about 40 per cent, of the additional cost in1940 but this would rise to 60 per cent, by 1950.16. The T.U.C. did not seriously challenge the Actuary&apos;s Report, though they thought his forecasts of future unemployment in their effect on futureincome from contributions were rather pessimistic. They said that, if their scheme were adopted, they would recommend an increase of Sd. all round in contributions. i.c. raising the contributions in respect of men from lid. to Is. 7d.and in respect of women from 5^d. to Is. 1M. They thought this 8c/. should be shared equally between employers and Avorkers. The balance of the cost, orroughly 50 per cent., should, in their view, be found by the Exchequer. they made it quite plain, however, that they would only recommend an increase in contributions if the Government accepted the main principles of their proposal and raised the general rate of pension by not less than 5s. They saw little meritin a rise of 2s. 6a., since this would not be large enough to induce people to retire from industry and would not provide sufficient on which to live. They wouldnot, therefore, recommend an increase of half the suggested contributions forhalf the suggested benefits.-   V. Employers&apos; Views.17. The National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations have submitted a memorandum, in which they explain their views and say how farthey feel justified in offering to find increased contributions. They &quot; do not feel that the social service of old age pensions can be considered in a water-tightcompartment by itself without reference to the other Social Services,&quot; and they
point to the enormous growth in expenditure on social services generally since1914. The cost of old age pensions has increased from  10 million to  100 million in this period and now accounts for over one-third of the national expenditureon social services. The cost of the existing scheme increases at an alarmingrate, and attention is drawn to the statutory increases in the rates of contribution due to come into effect in 1946 and 1956.18. They draw attention to the &quot; misconception that the benefits in Old age pensions were intended to provide full maintenance &quot; and quote what the present prime Miister said on the subject in 1925 &quot; 10*. a week is obviously insufficientby itself to keep a grown man or a woman with the necessaries of life.....In our view it is not the function of any system of state insurance to supersedeevery other kind of thrift.&quot; They say that &quot; the criticism in Parliament appearsto have ignored the fact that 85 per cent of all those drawing pensions underthe existing scheme draw their pension each week as a legal right,&quot; and theyquote various facts and figures designed to show that only a small minority of old age pensioners really need any addition to their pension. They refer tothe statements made by Ministers about the imperative necessity for husbandingour financial resources for the successful prosecution of the war. and say thatif the Government lent its support to any flat rate increase, however paid for.irrespective of need,&quot; it cannot fail to create the impression that this country can afford to dissipate its income on non-essential purposes without therebyendangering the country&apos;s security an impression which must inevitablyencourage wage claims by workers actually at work, and undo a large partof the vital educational work regarding the dangers of inflation which theChancellor&apos;s speeches were designed to achieve.&quot;19. The Confederation take the view, in the light of these considerations,that any addition to the old age pension must be on the basis of need. they suggest that the charge is a legitimate charge on Local Rates &quot;as it has alwaysbeen,&quot; but, whatever agency is used, they say that it is clearly outside theinsurance scheme (in the same way as Unemployment Assistance is outsideUnemployment Insurance) and employers&apos; responsibility in regard to pensionsmust be strictly confined to the insurance side.20. The employers&apos; memorandum then proceeds to examine the finances of the insurance scheme and points to the reasons why the Exchequer^ liabilitiesunder that scheme are proving greater than was anticipated in 1925. &quot; In thesecircumstances the Confederation is prepared to say that, if it will assist theGovernment to solve the present agitation on a Needs Test basis as abovesuggested, it would be prepared to support the putting into operation now ofthe increase of Id. in contributions which, under the existing law, is not due to begin until 1946. That increased contribution, coupled with that of the workers,will yield some  6 million a year a sum equivalent to what the Exchequer^new liability would be if it took over and administered by some other agencythe liability at present administered by the Public Assistance Authorities andborne by Local Rates.&quot;VI. The demand and the need.21. The demand for an improvement in old age pensions appears to ariselargely in respect of two classes : (i) The old age pensioner who has seen better days and has practically noother resources and no relatives to whom he can look for support, but is very unwilling to apply for public assistance;(ii) The wife who is somewhat younger than her husband and who does not qualify for pension until she reaches the age of 65. This is particu-larly marked in the case of anrples who have been in receipt ofunemployment benefit or assistance. Until the man was 65 he wouldhave been getting 27s. if on benefit, and about 26s. if on assistance,whereas, on reaching the age of 65. the family income drops suddenlyto 10s.
22. There has, of course, also been considerable demand for payment ofpensions to spinsters at a lower age than 65, but the spinsters&apos; case was fullyexamined and reported on in the Spring of 1939 by a strong Committee underthe Chairmanship of Mr. C. T. Le Quesne, ICC. The general conclusion of that committee was that there was no good case for lowering the age of pension forspinsters unless all-round improvements were made in the pensions scheme as affecting women.23. There is exceptionally little demand for any increase in the rate ofpension for widows under 65. The T.U.C. agreed that their case was, in general,not nearly so deserving as that of the older person, and I do not think that inany case we need contemplate improving the position of widows under 65.24. There are nearly three million old persons over 65 drawing a pension,and the cases of hardship that arise under (i) and (ii) in paragraph 21 above are small in number compared with the total. In the three million there are about375,000 persons who are in receipt of wages and, though the numbers cannot be stated, it is known that there are a considerable number who are paying incometax. Moreover, there are large numbers of workers who are drawing pension under employers&apos; superannuation schemes and trade union pension schemes. Thenumber of these is not known, but at the end of 1936 there were some 7,000employers&apos; superannuation schemes in operation covering about 1,600,000 persons,of whom perhaps 1,300.000 would be in insured occupations, though the numberof persons in receipt of pensions under these schemes would, of course, be verymuch smaller.25. Only about 10-  per cent, of old age pensioners apply for supplementa-tion to the Public Assistance Committees, and it is difficult to believe that thereare still any very large number who prefer destitution to the alleged indignity of applying for public assistance. Enquiries I have made seem to show that, whilemuch is made by our opponents in the House of the stigma of public assistance,the great majority of industrial workers do not feel very strongly on this point,particularly since the abolition of the old Boards of Guardians and Poor Law.Much has been done in recent years to reform the public assistance machinery ofthe country, and I am assured that the modern Relieving Officer is a man of sympathy and education.26. On the whole, therefore, I think we may legitimately draw theconclusion that, while there are undoubtedly hard cases which in the aggregatemay amount to a considerable number, they represent in total but a very small proportion of the whole three million pensioners. It seems, therefore, that wehave to decide whether we should endeavour to do something for the whole threemillion or whether we should confine any improvement we can make to those whoreally need it with the possible lowering of the age of qualification for women.VII. Possible Improvements in the Scheme.27. I have examined many different suggestions for improving the schemeof old age pensions, the more important of which may be summarised as follows : (i) The T.U.C. scheme  see Section IV above. I am convinced that anambitious scheme of this type involving an additional Exchequercharge of  24 million a year rising to  35 million within 5 years, aswell as increased contributions of 8d. for all workers, is not consistent with the circumstances of the country in time of war.(ii) A scheme for increasing pensions for all persons over 65 from 10s. to12s. Gd. This would cost  19-4 million extra next year and the cost would rise to  23-2 million extra in 1950. It would give an extra2s. Gd. to a very large number of persons who do not need it. but itwould be insufficient for many of the minority who need some addition.Moreover, it has been definitely rejected by the T.U.C.(iii) (a) Lowering the age at which wives of old age pensioners qualify for pension to 60. This would cost  4^ million next year, rising to 4f million in 10 years&apos; time if the pension were 10s.&apos;(b) Reducing the age of pension for insured women to 60. This would cost about  4-1 million next year, rising to nearly  6 million in10 years&apos; time if the pension were 10*-.
(6-) If the pension age is reduced for insured women as well as for wives,the total cost would be  8-1 million next year, rising to  10 million in ten years&apos; time. The cost is a little less than the sum of (iii) (a)and (b) combined, owing to the fact that certain wives of insured menare themselves employed contributors and would benefit under eitherproposal.(iv) Leaving the general structure of the pensions scheme, both contributoryand non-contributory, unchanged, but providing supplementation for old age pensioners at the cost of the Exchequer subject to a test ofneeds on the family basis. This proposal is considered in greater detail in the next section.VIII. Supple?nentation on a needs basis.28. If we accept the view that all that can be done at present is to supple-ment pensions in cases where there is real need, it would be necessary to ensurethat the administration of the needs test was entrusted to some efficientorganisation which would work under Government control, but should be removedas far as possible from the political field. While we might have to agree toabandon any attempt to effect recoveries towards maintenance of pensionersfrom &quot; liabie relatives&apos;&quot; living in other households, there is no need to abandon the general conception, which is based on sound social instincts, that sons anddaughters who live in the same household as their aged parents should contributesomething towards their maintenance; where the son is the householder he should at least provide shelter for his old parents without making any charge. Thereshould be no need whatever to make any supplementary payment to pensionerswho are living in the same household as sons or sons-in-law who are in receiptof good wages unless the number of grandchildren is considerably in excess ofthe normal. Nor would there be any justification for making supplementarypayments to old persons who have accumulated considerable savings on whichthey can properly be expected to draw in the declining years of their life. Itis, in my view, essential that these basic principles should be accepted and thatour intentions in the matter should be made quite clear so as to avoid subsequenttrouble. Unless the supplementation is on a fairly strict household needs basiswe should clearly be opening the way to very large expenditure by way ofsupplementation, especially if the cost of living rises steeply.29. At the same time we could, I think, claim that by making suchsupplementation an Exchequer charge we were doing something to improve theposition of old age pensioners. As explained above, we could abandon anyattempt to place responsibility for maintenance on &quot; liable relatives &quot; living inother parts, or in other households, and we should remove the so-called stigmaof public assistance with all that it implies in the way of examination of circumstances by persons who have lived in the area for a long time and maybe known personally to the applicant. Moreover, we should, of course, meetentirely the complaints of Local Authorities that supplementation of old age pensions is proving a growing and excessive charge on the rates.30. If we accept the view that the Government should supplement pensions in cases of need it is necessary to consider what machinery should be used. Thereseem to be four possible courses:  (i) Public Assistance Committees. These are Committees of LocalAuthorities and, though they have had long experience inadministering a family needs test, I should hesitate to entrust tomany of them administration of a scheme the whole of whose costfalls on the Exchequer. Something of this nature was attemptedin the case of &quot;transitional payments&quot; under the UnemploymentInsurance scheme, but it is, I think, generally agreed that the experi-ment was not a success,(ii) Local Pensions Committees. These Committees consider claims to non-contributory pensions subject to a means, but not to a needs, test.These Committees are also Committees appointed by Local Authoritiesand they have not had the experience of Public Assistance committees in administering a needs test.   The general standard of efficiency of
these Committees is not very high and they would, in my view, beeven less to be trusted than Public Assistance Committees in thedistribution of public money,(iii) Establishment of some new organisation with offices all over the country.This would be extremely expensive and should only be accepted asa last resort.(iv) Using the existing machinery of the Unemployment Assistance Board,which has now had nearly 5 years&apos; experience, in administering a family needs test.31. On the whole I prefer the fourth of these courses, though if we use themachinery of the Board there are various questions which we should have toconsider.&quot; It might be desirable, for instance, to have a separate Board (though with the same Chairman and Staff as those of the existing Board) and to give it a separate title, such as the &quot;Old Age Pensions Supplementation Board,&quot;The new Board might be responsible to the Minister of Health and the Secretaryof State for Scotland instead of to the Minister of Labour, and it might be possibleto arrange for payments authorised by the new Board to be made through thePost Offices instead of through the Employment Exchanges. By these meanswe should be able to meet much of the criticism which might otherwise be directed against the proposal, though it would be essential to use the existing organisationof the Board and also to maintain the same general principles of the family means test as are applied in the case of unemployment assistance.32. In the case of old age pensioners there is less likelihood of changes in circumstances than in the case of younger persons capable of work, and in manycases it might be possible for the Board &apos;s officers to authorise payment of a supplementary jDension for a considerable period ahead without the necessityfor constant detailed inquiry into family circumstances. No doubt the Board&apos;sOfficers would learn by experience how far such concessions could legitimately begranted, but subject to necessary safeguards against abuse the scheme should be administered in such a manner as to cause the minimum of inconvenience andworry to the old persons. In many cases the payment would become virtuallya supplementary pension, which would be continued automatically in the absenceof a change in personal circumstances, and, if payment through the Post Officecan be arranged, the pensioner could hardly feel that any stigma was attachedto its receipt.33. If the Government assume financial responsibility for supplementingold age pensions on a needs basis we should be relieving Local Authorities of then-expenditure which, as shown above, amounted last March to about Bh\ million per annum. This uncovenanted relief would justify demanding a contribution from local authorities in some form or other of about this sum. There are,however, other major financial questions likely to come to issue with localauthorities in the not distant future and I suggest that for the time being weshould content ourselves with a simple operation on the block grant.34. The block grant is due for review in 1942 and there would then be an automatic saving to the Exchequer of about 23 per cent, of this sum. I think,however, we should be justified in expecting some contribution from LocalAuthorities during the intervening period, and I suggest that our policv shouldbe as follows : (i) Demand 23 per cent, of the  5^ million forthwith for the remainder ofthe current quinquennium, merely taking it out of the block grant ona basis to be discussed with the Ministry of Health and ScottishDepartment of Health,(ii) Defer a final settlement as between Local Authorities and the Exchequeruntil the next review of the block grant, when probably other majormatters will also have to be considered,(iii) Stake out our claim that in any current financial negotiations with local Authorities we shall take credit for the relief we are nowaffording.35.   As part of (iii) above we should, I suggest, take the opportunity of thelegislation which will be necessary in order to revise the present complicated and unsatisfactory procedure relating to payment of pensions to persons in rate-aided[20605] c
IDinstitutions of all types. There is no need at tins stage to explain this positionin full, hut, broadly, I suggest that we should, as a small quid pro quo, requireLocal Authorities&apos; to bear the whole expense of maintaining pensioners inrate-aided institutions of any type. The pension, whether contributory ornon-contributory, should be stopped, and the Local Authority should be required(instead of permitted as under the present law) to give the pensioner a small amount of pocket money weekly. We might make one exception, namely, agreeto the payment of pension for a period not exceeding three months for pensionerswho are admitted to Local Authority hospitals and are certified as likely to be discharged within that period. In such cases the pension should be paid to the pensioner and not to the Local Authority, and would be intended to enable the pensioner to maintain the rent of the house or rooms occupied prior to admission to the hospital. The details of this proposal would need to be examined inconjunction with the Health Departments and the Board of Customs and Excise.IX. Recommendations.36. I recommend that the Government should adopt (iii) (c) and (iv) inSection VII above, that is : (a) admit to pension a wife not under the age of 60 of a contributorypensioner of 65 years or over;(b) lower the pension age for insured women to 60; and(c) accept responsibility for supplementing all old-age pensions from age 65(men) and 60 (women) at 100 per cent. Exchequer cost on a householdneeds basis.37. Attached in Appendix B is a memorandum by the Government Actuaryon the financial effect of the reduction of the pension age under the existing scheme to age (JO for insured women and wives of contributory pensioners. Iwould suggest that contributions under the contributory scheme should be raised as from July next from lid. to Is. Id. in the case of men and from 5hd. to S-ld.in the case of women one penny of the additional contributions being paid ineach case by the employer and the remainder by the worker. This would produce,at the present exceptionally high rate of income per penny of contributions, about 8^ million per annum. The decennial increases already fixed by statute for1946 and 1956 should, of course, still take effect in addition to the increases now suggested.38. The admission of wives between 60 and 65 and the lowering of the pension age for insured women should come into operation next July, and thesupplementation on a needs basis should come into operation as soon as thenecessary administrative arrangements could be made and legislation passed.39. It is very difficult to form any reliable estimates as to the cost of my proposals. As stated above, the cost of reducing the age for wives to 60 and oflowering the pension age for insured women is, at the present time, about 8 million per annum; this cost would under these proposals be approximatelymet from additional contributions. Public Assistance Committees last march were paying ouc supplementation at a rate of about  5^ million per annum, but with the rise in the cost of living it is probable that this figure has alreadyincreased. If the cost of living continues to rise the Exchequer would, under my proposal, bear the whole cost of additional -supplementation required.Moreover, the proposed substitution of a household needs test administered by a Government Department for the present family needs test administered by public Assistance Committees will no doubt attract a considerable number ofadditional applicants. On the other hand, there would be some saving onsupplementation due to the lowering of the age for women&apos;s pensions and torecovery as suggested in paragraph 34 under the Block Grant. Very roughlyI estimate the immediate cost to the Exchequer at  10 million per annum, butthis would rise considerably if the cost of living continues to increase and the potential liabilities are verv considerable.J. S.Treasury Chambers. January 12. 1940.
APPENDIX A.Old Age Pensions.Certain Features of the Existing Scheme.(1) AT present, contributory pensions are payable from age 65 to insuredpersons (whether men or women) at the rate of 10s. a week. A pension is payablealso to the wife of an insured pensioner, whether or not she is herself an insured person on reaching pension age. If the wife is uninsured and is younger thanher husband, her pension does not commence until she herself reaches age 65; if she is the elder of the two she has to wait until her husband becomes a pensioner.A pension is payable also to the widow (if not already pensioned) of an insuredmarried man irrespective of her age at widowhood, and payments are made inrespect of dependent children of widows and motherless orphans.(2) These pensions, payable up to age 70 under the Contributory PensionsActs, are continued from age 70 to the end of life as old age pensions under theOld Age Pensions Act. Persons who are not qualified, on reaching age 70, forcontributory &quot; by virtue &quot; pensions, may become entitled, on the ground of means,to non-contributory or &quot; means &quot; pensions at 10-*. a week or less, according to theamount of such means.(3) The present conditions for the receipt of non-contributory old age pensions are perhaps not sufficiently appreciated. The full pension of 105. a week is subject to reduction if the pensioners means exceed a certain amount.   Thescale of means is as follows :  WeeklyAnnual means. pension.Not exceeding  26 5s................      10s. 26 5s-  31 10s...................        8s. 31 10*.- 36 15*...................        6s. 36 15s.- 42       ..................        4s. 42- 47 5s. ..................        2s. 47 5s.- 49 17s. 6^/................        Is.In assessing the annual means, the first  39 of unearned income is excluded.Further, in the case of married couples, the combined means are divided by twofor the purpose of applying the scale of means to each individual. The result is that a married couple, both of whom are aged over 70. can possess other meansup to  2 10s. a week provided at least  1 10s. of that sum is unearned and yet be entitled together to the full pension of  1 a week, making a total joint income of  3 10s. a week. The rules for determining the yearly value of any propertybelonging to the pensioner are aiso generous, and it is thus possible for marriedcouples possessing capital of as much, as  1,730 and for single persons possessinghalf this amount to enjoy the full rates of pension.(4) From the brief statement of benefit conditions given above, it will be observed that contributory pensions once given continue for life; except that, inthe case of widows&apos; pensions, they cease on re-marriage; that the pension age isthe same for men as for women, but that, in the case of a married couple, the combined pension of 20s. a week does not become payable until both husband and wife are aged 65 or over.(5) The rates of contribution payable for these benefits are, at present, lid.a week for men and 5^d. a week for women, of which approximately one-half is payable by the employer and one-half by the insured person. These contributions were fixed at Qd. and 4^d. respectively at the beginning of the scheme inJanuary 1926, and the first of three decennial increases of contribution (2d. menand Id. women), Avas added as from January 1936. When the remaining decennialincreases take effect in January 1946 and 1956. respectively the total pensionscontributions will be Is. 3d. for men and 7^d. for women. The object of thedecennial increases of contribution was gradually to convert the bulk of the over-70 pensions charge on to a contributory basis, and it was originally estimatedthat contributors who entered after the year 1955 at the initial age of 16 and paid contributions throughout their insurance lifetime at the rate of &quot;is. 3d. (men)or 7\d. (women), would pay for approximately the whole of the value of thebenefits for which they were insured, both before and after age 70.[20605, c 2
(6) The working of the scheme fiom the financial point of view has not been quite so favourable as was estimated at the outset, and this was brought out inthe first actuarial review in 1935. It is now estimated that at their ultimatelevels, namely, Is. 3d. for men and 7%d. for women, the contributions for entrantsat age 16 from 1955 onwards will support about 5-6ths of the related benefits. Atthe present time, however, only the first of the three decennial increases has been imposed, and the existing contributions, namely, 11V. men and o\d. women(ignoring future decennial increases), are estimated to be equivalent to about-8ths of the related benefits. It should be added that this proportion appliesequally to men and to women, the contributions of men taken in conjunction withthe pre-marriage contributions of their wives being equivalent to about 5-8ths ofthe cost of the benefits, both before and after 70, to which they and their wives,or willows, will become entitled, whilst in the case of insured women, the presentcontribution of o\d. is estimated to support approximately the same proportionof the benefits to which they will become entitled in the event of their notmarrying. In relation to the existing scales and conditions of benefits the present plan under which women pay contributions at one-half of the men&apos;s rate thussecures equity between the sexes: it must not be assumed, however, that thiswould apply if the scheme were enlarged.(7) In the previous paragraph I have dealt with the sufficiency of the presentscales of contribution in relation to entrants at age 16. It must be remembered,however, that the contributory system started only in 1926, and that during thefirst 10 years the rate of contribution payable was only 9d. for men and 4-^/. forwomen. In the case of the bulk of the present insured population the proportionof the cost of benefits supported, on an insurance basis, by the contributions ofthe workers and their employers is necessarily much lower than the figures given above.At the outset, therefore, the Exchequer assumed very substantial liabilitiesfor initial entrants who were brought into the scheme at the flat rate of con-tributions irrespective of age.(8) The balance of the cost of benefits not met from the contributions ofinsured persons and their employers is provided from the Exchequer. In addition,the Exchequer is still paying, and will for many years to come have to pay, theentire cost of the pensions granted under the Act of 1925 and extended by the act of 1929 to the widows of men who, though they were of the insurable class, haddied before 1926 and thus had never paid contributions to the Scheme. Inaddition to these charges arising under the Contributory Pensions Acts, theExchequer has to meet the cost of means pensions to those persons who do not qualify for contributory pensions. The annual payment under this head, thoughit is a gradually diminishing amount, will continue at a substantial amountpermanently.(9) The financial arrangements of the Contributory Pensions Scheme are notrun as an accumulative fund and the Exchequer does not meet its liabilities underthe various heads described above by a series of annual charges designed toextinguish its liabilities over a term of years. Instead, it meets, broadly speaking,the deficiency in each years contribution income as compared with expenditure,the actual machinery being as follows :  (i) An annual grant is made to the Treasury Pensions Account for pensionsup to age 70. This sum is statutorily fixed on a rising scale up to april 1946, the amount rising from  19 millions for 1940-41 by 1 million a year to  21 millions for each year, 1942-43 to 1945-46.Thereafter the annual grant will be redetermined, probably at a figurerather more than  22 millions a year. The Exchequer contributions tothe Treasury Pensions Account are intended to make good the excessof estimated expenditure over estimated contribution income over aseries of years, and any balance in the Pensions Account accruing overa period is thus fortuitous and goes towards adjusting the finances ofthe Account in the next period.(ii) Annual appropriations are made to the Vote of the Customs and ExciseDepartment for old age pensions over age 70, whether contributory(&quot;by virtue&quot;) or non-contributory (&quot;means&quot;). These pensions are estimated to require  49-8 millions for 1940-41, of which  35-2millions relates to &quot;by virtue &quot; pensions and  14-6 millions to&quot; means &quot; pensions.  The annual grant is estimated to rise gradually
.13to about  60-6 millions in 10 years&apos; time, of which  47-2 millions willrelate to &quot; by virtue&quot; pensions and  13-4 millions to &quot;means&quot;pensions, and the cost of pensions after age 70 will continue to increase for many years thereafter,(iii) An annual Exchequer grant is now made to the Special VoluntaryContributors&apos; Pensions scheme set up by the Act of 1937. The initialpayments will average  1 - 6 million for the three years 1939-40 to1941-2 : thereafter it is estimated that the Exchequer liability willbe met by an average annual payment of about  1-5 million for thebalance of a term of 30 years. As a result of this new scheme therewill be some addition to the cost of old age pensions after 70 com-mencing in about 15 years&apos; time; this liability will fall upon theExchequer.(10) Under present arrangements the financial working of the schemes ofcontributory pensions and means pensions leaving out of account SpecialVoluntary Contributors is estimated to be as follows for the next 25 years. Thefollowing statement gives, at five-yearly intervals :(i) the annual cost of benefits and administration on contributory pensions(a) up to age 70. and (b) over age 70 (*&apos; by virtue &quot; pensions);(ii) the income from contributions, allowing for the decennial increases due in 1946 and 1956;(iii) the excess of expenditure over income for contributory pensions, whichfalls to be met from the Exchequer; and(iv) the cost of over-70 &quot; means &quot; pensions, all of which falls on theExchequer.(Figures in   millions.)Year.

In addition, the Exchequer will pay  14-6 millions for&quot;means&quot; pensions as well as  1-6 millions to the Special VoluntaryContributors&apos; scheme. Thus, the total charge upon the Exchequer in 1940-41 forcontributory and non-contributory pensions will be as follows : Contributory &apos;&apos; Means &apos;&apos;Pensions. Pensions.Grant to    millions.   millions.Treasury Pensions Account     ...      ...      19-0Old Age Pensions Vote (apportioned) ...      35-2 14-6Special   Treasury   Pensions   Account(Special Voluntary Contributors)...54-21-614-655-814-6 70-4 millions.
i4(11) In comparing the figures for 1940-41 with those for later years, it maybe noted that the income from contributions in 1940-41 will, if recent experience is repeated, reach a very high level, owing partly to relatively light unemploymentas compared with the estimates based on the average over the quinquennium, andpartly to a sharp increase in the insured population. It was thought appropriate to allow for these features in estimating for the immediate future, viz., 1940-41.but for the estimates for later years to adhere to the assumptions made in thefirst decennial review of the Government Actuary in 1935. The position in these respects appears at the moment too uncertain to justify revising the basis of thefinancial estimates for the scheme on the assumption that the new features justreferred to will be permanent. Moreover, so far as the increase in income from contributions is due to a growth in the number of insured persons, the expenditureon benefits will, in due course, be affected. For the present investigation,however, it is thought premature to attempt to frame new long-term estimates.The effect is, as regards the year 1940-41. to show an abnormally high projDortionof pensions expenditure as accounted for by income from contributions, and this important qualification should be kept in mind in considering this or other similarestimates in the report.(12) Tt will be noted that the proportion of the cost of contributory pensions(including &quot;; by virtue &quot; over-7() pensions) at present met by the contributions ofinsured persons and their employers, viz.. about 40 per cent., differs widely fromthe proportion of the cost of his or her own future benefits, which will be paid for by an entrant at age 16 paying present rates of contributions, viz.. fths (seeparagraph 7). This difference is due to many causes, some of the most importantbeing that the current cost of contributory pensions includes (a) widows&apos; pensionsgranted under the Acts of 1925 and 1929. and over-70 pensions &quot; by virtue &quot; ofthe Act of 1925, for which no contributions were ever paid and for which theExchequer bears 100 per cent, of the cost, and (b) all types of contributory pensions for which contributions, though paid for some period, did not begin stage 16. and for which, therefore, the Exchequer has to meet the major portion ofthe cost. These charges represent a heavy and continuing burden on theExchequer, in addition to the subsidy which it gives to the normal entrant to insurance at age 16.APPENDIX B.Old Age Pensions.Financial effect of the reduction of the pension age under the existing schemeto age 60 for insured women and -trices of pensioners.THE value of the present contributory benefits is equivalent to a weekly contribution payable from age 16 of about 1.?. Gd. for men and Qd. for women. Thepresent contributions, namely lid. for men and o^d. for women, are thusequivalent to about five-eighths of the actuarial contributions for each sex. this proportion will be larger when the remaining decennial increases have been imposed, until ultimately, for entrants at 16 from 1956 onwards, both men andwomen will be paying contributions equivalent to about five-sixths of the related benefits.By the enlargement of the scheme, by the granting of the present pension of 10s. (a) to the wives aged 60 to 65 of pensioners, and (b) to insured womenat 60, the value of the benefits expressed as a contribution at age 16 is increasedto about Is. 6o-c/. for men and Is. for women. The reason for the large increasein the case of women is that their contributions have to provide for five more yearsof pension in every case,* whereas the contributions paid by men have to providefor some extra years of pension (up to, but not exceeding, five years) only wherethe man has a wife, and where that wife is younger than her husband.It will be seen that, while under the existing scheme it is equitable to chargewomen a contribution of one-half of the men&apos;s rate, this relationship would nolonger obtain if the pension age for women were lowered to 60. For the scheme as enlarged the value of women&apos;s benefits as compared with men&apos;s, expressed interms of the contribution for an entrant at age 16, is as two is to three, and it is* Further, the contributions paid by women would, under the revised conditions, have to cease at 60 instead of 65.
15therefore equitable that the new contribution for women should be two-thirds ofthat fixed for men.2. Whilst at present both sexes are paying about five-eighths, or 02 percent., only of the full actuarial contributions, it would appear appropriate inpresent circumstances that the contributors should pay for a somewhat largerpart of their benefits. If the addition to the men&apos;s contribution is fixed at 2d.they will be paying, on a contribution of Is. Id., just over 70 per cent, of theappropriate actuarial contribution. For women the corresponding contributionequivalent to the same proportion of benefits is 8%d., i.e., an increase of 3d.As regards future decennial increases due to commence in 1946 and 1956respectively theoretically the increase of 2d. for men should be accompanied byan addition of l^d. for women. But the excess of this figure over the Id. increases which are now prescribed is probably not sufficient to make it desirable to vary the existing arrangement. Ultimately, therefore, for entrants after 1955. the enlarged contributions of 1.-: 5d. for men (viz.. Is. ld^2d.-\-2d.) and U)\d. forwomen (viz., %^d. ^-Id.-*r Id.) will be equivalent to about 93 per cent, and 87 percent, respectively of all contributory benefits.3. By lowering the pension age for wives to 60 about 160,000 additionalpensions will be granted at the outset to women whose husbands are alreadypensioned. As a result the proportion of married couples entitled to a fullpension of 20s. as soon as the husband attains age 65 will be increased from thepresent figure of 28 per cent, to 63 per cent. In the case of the remaining 37 percent., where the wife is more than five years younger than her husband, there willbe some waiting period after the husband becomes a pensioner before she becomeseligible.In the case of insured women (apart from employed married women includedabove) the change will add about 150.000 new pensioners at the outset.4. It is estimated that the gross cost of the additional pensions payable as aresult of these changes would be about  8 millions in the first full year (taken as1940-41), rising to  10 millions in ten years&apos; time. The annual produce of theadditional contributions of 2d. (men) and 3c/. (women) would be about  8-J- millions in the first full year. At the outset, therefore, the new income will be slightly inexcess of the additional expenditure. In ten years&apos; time, however, there will be asubstantial shortage due to the fact that the new expenditure is increasing,whereas the produce of contributions will probably decline appreciably from thepresent exceptionally high level. In 1950-51 the shortage is estimated to be about 3 millions. In framing the necessary legislation it will doubtless be considered desirable to review the Exchequer charge, as at present prescribed, adding anannual amount in the neighbourhood, probably, of  1 million a year from the outset on an equalised plan ranging, probably, over a term of years ending later than the date (the 31st March. 1946) up to which the charge is at present fixed.5. Combining the figures of income and expenditure under the present scheme and as added to by these proposals, but apart from the cost to theExchequer of the supplementary benefits, which have been excluded from con-sideration in this note, the following statement shows the position in the firstfull year (taken as 1940-41) and in ten and twenty years respectively:  (  millions.)Year.

16The figures of Exchequer grant shown in the Table relate to the estimatedannual excess of expenditure over income. If, as suggested in the preceding paragraph, the Exchequer additional contribution were equalised over a period,the present Exchequer contribution to contributory pensions, viz.,  53-8 millions,would be increased by say a million, with some abatement from the figures given above for later years.6. The foregoing estimates leave out of account the new Special VoluntaryContributors Scheme, which would require special consideration.G. S. W. E.January 11, 1940.
