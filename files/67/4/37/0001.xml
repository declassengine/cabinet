(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROP-IRTY OF HIS BRITANNIC rAJ&quot;JSTY&apos;SC-OVEitNMENT)5SCiv:,iW.F.(G)(40) 37. Copy No..WAR CABININDIA aND THE T,VAR&apos;orthcoming conversations between the Governor-Generaland Lr. GandhiMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor indian my memorandum W.P.(G)(40) 32 dated 29th JanuaryI circulated two telegrams dated respectively 28th and 26thJanuary in which the Governor-General and I had beenindependently attempting to clear our minds as to thepossible issues, with which we might be faced in the nearfuture as the result of the impending conversations toeGovernor-General intends to hold with Mr. Gandhi.    I now circulate as Appendix A to this memorandum a telegram givingthe Governor-General1s further views in the light of those contained in my telegram to him.2.        On 6th November last the War Cabinet in its 73rdConclusions, Minute No. 1, decided inter alia that it wasimpossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to accede to thedemands of Congress for a formal declaration to the effectively had set out in my memorandum W.P. (G) (39) 71, but that,while it was impossible to accede to these demands, it was desirable both from the point of view of opinion in Indiaand elsewhere that no step should be taken which would place any obstacles in the way of resumption of co-operation by Congress.   The immediate occasion of the forthcoming meeting between the Governor-General and Mr. Gandhi is thatthe latter professes to have found in remarks made by the

Governor-General in a. speech delivered on January 10th atthe Orient Club, Bombay (quoted in Appendix 3 to thismemorandum) a better prospect of an agreement than was tobe found in the Governor-General&apos;s offer of 17th October.This offer was briefly, after the end of the war,reconsideration of the provisions of the Government ofIndia Act, 1935, and,  immediately, the reconstruction ofthe Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council so as to include in it representatives of the Congress and of the iwoslemLeague, together with the appointment of a consultative committee, representing ail interests, to be informed on and advised about the prosecution of war measures.3.        The general situation in India has a bearing on theproblem which I am placing before the Cabinet.   When theCongress Governments went out of office there was a definiteexpectation of disorder in the provinces, and carefulmeasures were taken to provide against it.   But theseanticipations have so far proved completely mistaken.   TheProvinces are, in fact, unusually quiet.    This is no doubtdue to a large extent to the material prosperity in the rural districts due to the rise in the price of primary products such as jute.   The rise in foodstuffs has had itsreactions among the urban population, but this has to alarge extent been controlled by Government action ana hashad no serious effect.   The other explanation of theabsence of disturbance is that it has not been convenient for Congress to stimulate it.   There has been a good dealof controversy between Mr. Jinnah and Congress about the alleged raisusage of the iviuslim population while theCongress Governments were in power.   Congress does not admit the truth of any of these charges, but it must have occurred to them that the moment disorder arose in the

districts it was much more likely to take the form ofcommunal clashes than of organised resistance to the presentofficial Government.    It has, in fact, been admitted by Mr.Gandhi himself that civil disobedience is inexpedient whilethe existing strained relations between the All-India moslem league and the Congress prevail.4.        But though India is at present peaceful, we nave tota^e account of the possibility of an attempt to maketrouble if the present discussions lead to a dramaticbreakdown.    I do not think that Mr. Gandhi himseif would bea willing party to any such attempt, but if he failed to save his face in the discussions with the Viceroy, theinitiative in Congress might pass to Nehru and the LeftWing, who would be much more likely to stimulate unrest.There are three possible forms that it might take.   For thereasons I have given above general rural disorder of anagrarian kind is not very likely, though the possibility ofa no tax campaign cannot be wholly excluded.   Terrorism ispossible, but though terrorism has never been limited toBengal, Bengal was its most dangerous field and Bengal is inthe hands of a non-Congress Government.    It would not cause a breakdown in the administration any more than it did inthe past, and it would scarcely be likely to attract sympathyfrom world opinion.   The third form of revolt - civildisobedience - is much the most likely and most dangerous.If it were widespread and effective it could interfereseriously with India&apos;s contribution to the war.    I have nodoubt that it could be countered or suppressed, but that.would entail methods inconsistent with our declared war aims, which would inevitably bring us into disrepute with world opinion.

5.      Mr. Gandhi is not without difficulties in his ownhouse.   Some of his more important followers, and probablyMr. Gandhi himself, are very apprehensive of a communisticor extreme socialistic movement in and out of Congress.His willingness at the moment to discuss a settlement is nodoubt due to his desire to strengthen his position againstthe Left Wing, which is demanding quick results - andpartly, no doubt, to the reflection that the nuisance valueof Congress is greater when they are in control ofProvinces than when they are in the wilderness.6.        Unless Mr. Gandhi has materially modified his views,the general problem with which we are now faced, stated inits simplest terms, is insistence by the Congress on the onehand that His Majesty&apos;s Government shall acknowledge nowIndia&apos;s right to full self-government and give effect to itas soon as may be after the war on the basis of a constitution to be framed by Indians themselves by means ofa &quot;Constituent Assembly&quot; free from outside dictation: andon the other hand insistence by the Moslems, and to someextent by other minorities.that if full self-government is toconnote the form of government by majority vote familiar to western democracies this will mean a permanent Hindu raj towhich they decline to submit themselves: and accordinglythat no commitment shall be made as to India&apos;s future towhich the minorities are not consenting parties.   So far theCongress have declined specifically to admit any necessityfor prior agreement with the minorities as a condition precedent to the declaration it demands; its contention isthat the Constituent Assembly to which it has deeply committ-ed itself as an Instrument by which the new Constitution mustht: fashioned will itself adequately secure protection forthe minorities and that minorities have no right to hold uparbitrarily the will of the majority.

7.        It is difficult to. say in advance of the meeting between the Viceroy and Mr. Gandhi on what lines thediscussion will move.   But the subject-matter divides itselfbroadly into -(i) the substance of the promises made by His majesty&apos;s government; and(ii) the road by which and the time at which the goalpromised is to be reached.I propose to set down shortly the general lines onwhich I suggest that the Viceroy might proceed under eachof these heads,- and discuss later the more disputable ofthem, togeCher with the Question whether it is necessary or desirable that he should commit himself to all of them atthis stage.8.       ,As regards substance -(i) We are committed up to the hilt to a promise ofDominion Status (see Appendix A); but(ii) the self-government promised is self-government within the Empire and I suggest that the viceroy should decline to discuss not only any other basis,but also any ideas connected with a right to secede.(iii) The Dominion Status contemplated is Dominion Statusnot for British India, but for British India andsuch proportion of the Indian States as will ensurethat India can stand on her feet as a singleadministrative unit.As regards the means of attainment of Dominion Status(iv) He should make it clear that there can be noquestion whatever of this country&apos;s attempting toimpose on any large section of the Indian populationa self-government Constitution, or indeed important decisions preliminary to the emergence of such a

Constitution to which those sections are determinednot to submit.   The expression &quot; self-government&quot; can have no application to arrangements whereby domesticdifferences are to be settled by the compulsion of a third party from outside as the only alternative to internal disruption.   It follows that the first step,and the step without which we can do nothing to expedite the attainment of Dominion Status, is that congress and the great minorities must make up their differences and agree on a scheme of safeguards for themselves which can be incorporated in a constitution and will not require intervention from outsiae to implement them,(v) On the other hand he should make it clear that wecannot allow any minority to interrupt the course of reform by using a veto for a patently unreasonablepurpose.   But of what is a reasonable and what isan unreasonable demand we must ourselves be the judgewhen the time comes, and the time will not come untilreal efforts have been made by both sides, in a spiritof compromise, to reach agreement,(vi) The Viceroy should then say quite frankly that we have our own desiderata and that they must be secured.    Ifit is argued that these desiderata are a denial of self-government the answer is that self-government does notconfer a right to pay no regard to the rights of otherself-governing countries, and that what we are askingwe think we are entitled to ask, even of a self-governing India.   Our desiderata are:(a) Arrangements for the defence of India as partof the Empire.(b) Security for the service of the sterling debtheld in this country.

(c) sufficient control of the Services to secure their reasonable rights, including their right to thecareer for which they were recruited.   But recruitmentby the Secretary of State will end at a fixed date.(d) The maintenance for some time at least of thecommercial safeguards of the kind in the present constitution.(e) Such a position in India as will enable us todischarge oar obligations to the States in so far as theStates are not incorporated in the new Dominion ofIndia.The means by which these desiderata are to be secured isfor discussion at a later stage.   We should be preparedto take them in the form which would be most consistent with the self-respect of the new Dominion.    They mightform part of the new Constitution by agreement;  orthey might be secured by a Treaty,(vii)   On all these assumptions we should be prepared toaccept a Constitution framed by Indians themselves,provided that we are satisfied that the major elements in India, including the States, had agreed to the composition of the body which was to determine theConstitution and the method by which that body should reach its conclusions, and that the Constitution which emerged was not manifestly unstable.9.        It will be seen from the Viceroy&apos;s telegrams that,while it does not appear that he would dissent from any ofthe principles which I have indicated in the preceding paragraph, his own desire is definitely to avoid committing himself so far.   His hope, if I have rightly understood him,is that he may persuade Mr. Gandhi to accept as a sufficientcompliance with the Congress demands, non-compliance withwhich has led to the resignations of the Congress Ministries

and the present deadlock, the following programme -(a) a further formal assertion of HisMajesty&apos;s Government1s fixed intention toenable India to attain Dominion Status atthe earliest possible date.(b) Participation by the Congress in thescheme previously mooted and rejected bythem of the addition of Hindu and mo siempoliticians to the Governor-General&apos; executive Council.(c) The inauguration of Federation so soonas the necessary number of States can be persuaded to accede and the necessarypreliminaries pushed through.(d) At some time in the future, at all events after the war, consultation withIndians on the revision of theConstitution, using for choice the newFederal Legislature as the consultativebody.10.        If in fact the Viceroy finds he can proceed on this basis, well and good.    I must frankly admit,however, that I myself can see no chance of this planproving the basis of fruitful discussion - for two reasons.   The first and chief is that in my estimationthe. chances of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s regarding such a programme as fulfilling the essence of the Congress desiderataare negligible.   The most which seems to me possible is that he might be prepared to profess acquiescencesimply in order to give him an excuse for getting his

Congress Ministries back into power and thus placing the Congress in a stronger position to reiterate their demands almost immediately,   my second reason is that,while the Viceroy admits that what he describes as&quot;minor amendments&quot; of the Federal provisions of the Actwould erobably be required to induce the mo siems and theStates to be willing parties to the Federal plan, Ishould myself have assumed that the kind of modificationwhich the Moslems at all events would demand would be such as could in no sense be described as &quot;minor&quot;, andsuch, further, as would be regarded by the Hindus intheir present mood as preposterous.   After all, the objection on the part of the Moslems to our federalplan was the same objection as they are new raisingto any form of responsible government at the Centre,namely, their conviction that on any process ofcounting of heads they will be under the permanentcontrol of the Hindu majority.     This being so,I anticipate that, unless the conversations with Mr. Gandhi are to break down almost as soon asthey start, the Viceroy must be prepared to offer a closer accommodation to the Congress point of view.

11.    But it is of even greater importance in my viewthat the Viceroy should indicate to Mr.Gandhi at the outset that the necessity for Indian agreement is the very rootand essence of the problem, and that the obstacles which such agreement alone can remove are of Indian and not ofBritish creation.    As will be seen from the Viceroy&apos;s secondtelegram, he is reluctant to stipulate in terms that theabsence of agreement &quot;will be regarded as a decisiveobjection to any form of constitutional advance&quot; because, he thinks,  the Congress will regard such an attitude asencouragement by us to the minorities, who will in fact be encouraged by it,  to adopt an obstructive attitude.    Thisview of the matter seems to me a misconception, and to assumeat the next stage a continuance of external control quiteinconsistent with responsible government.    The position isnot whether the British Government choose or do not choose to regard lack of agreement as a bar to progress;    it is that agreement is the only possible basis for further progress,unless the fair treatment of minorities is still to remain the ultimate responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom:    in other words, unless full self-government is still to remain a distant ideal.12.    But I regard the postulate of Indian agreement as    interlinked   with   the. acceptance   by   us    ofthe    results    of   that   agreement,    subject of course tothe stipulations indicated in paragraph 8(vi) and (vii)above - and that for two reasons:    first,  that I do notbelieve that any other line of approach will be acceptedby Mr.Gandhi as fulfilling his requirements, and secondlythat until discussion amongst Indians of their communalproblem and the possible solutions for it is undertaken inthe clear knowledge that they and they alone are responsible

for finding and maintaining a solution that communalagreement will never be forthcoming in India.    I suggest,therefore, if the 77a r Cabinet accept my view of this matter,that the Viceroy should be advised accordingly.13.    The alternative, of course, is to break with congress now.   As I have indicated earlier in thismemorandum, I believe that such a situation could be adequately dealt with:    but only by methods which would expose our general motives in the war to the most effectivecriticism.    American opinion of our policy in India is alreadysufficiently critical.    What it would be  if a non-cooperationmovement led, as it did last time, to the arrest anddetention without trial of as many as 25,000 persons - quite apart from the stories of prison camp treatment which would inevitably become current - is easy to imagine.    I do notthink we ought to risk this.    It may be said that there areno clear indications that Congress can launch a civildisobedience movement now.    That may be so, but I think It most unlikely that we can escape one for any length of time.Ihere is everything to be said for doing now what we shouldhave to do later under pressure.111.    I have a further suggestion to make, namely, thatif the Viceroy finds that he can make headway with Mr.gandhi and can persuade him that the first practical step is to devise machinery for the ascertainment of opinions and theproduction of agreement on the communal issues, he shouldurge upon Mr.Gandhi as the first step in this direction theassembly of a small body of representatives of the majority and of the chief minorities,  at the outside say ten personsin all,  to consider with or without the assistance of the-&apos;Viceroy himself at their deliberations, as he and they mayprefer,  the kind of problems they have to tackle and themost likely means of tackling them successfully.    During the

last; few weeks there has been a regrettable bombardment atlong range by leading personalities in the one party againstthe other through Press and platform statements, and theonly alternative hitherto suggested of getting down to the basic elements of the problem - a Constituent Assembly ofnecessarily enormous dimensions elected on a wide manhoodsuffrage - is so    fantastic as a practical proposition as   -hardly to merit serious consideration.15&apos;    Finally, as regards the stipulations which I have indicated in paragraph 8(vi) and (vii) of this memorandum,I suggest that the Viceroy should indicate his readiness toconsider any means which would enable their acceptancewithout giving ground for the criticism that they wereobviously imposed from outside and involved a seriousqualification on the complete self-government we arepurported to be talking about.    The machinery of a negotiated treaty seems to me an appropriate means ofsecuring this desideratum, and I suggest that he should beready,  if events make this feasible,  to indicate thatposs responsibility.16.    It may be that the method most helpful to theViceroy of assisting him in this matter will be to give him in time for his meeting on Monday the provisional viewsof the Cabinet, but to request him to report again onMonday evening in the light of them the course of his firstinterview with Mr.Gandhi.      At this interview he intends todo no more than hear what Mr.Gandhi has to say.Z.India Office,31st January, 191+0.

APPENDIX A.Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, January 30, 1940.Immediate.140-S. I have now been able to think over your most valuable personal telegram of 26th January. No. 431, and you will have had my telegram dated28th January, No. 127-S. It was of course prepared before receipt of yourNo. 431. But I think that in fact it disposes of the bulk of the points which you raise and that I can confine myself in this reply to certain specific issueson which you touch.2. Your paragraph No. 2. I am considering line you suggest aboutscheduled castes, and will probably telegraph separately to you about this.I revert below to general question of extent to which progress must be conditional on agreement here.3. Your paragraph No. 3. You will have gathered from my 127-S thatI fully agree with you as to difficulties of making any real progress on a limitedbasis/ and that in fact I contemplate going a good deal further, on the lines indicated in that telegram. You will have seen also that I equally accept thatone has to be prepared for discussion with Gandhi, and probably also withMoslems and Princes, about implications of, and approach to, Dominion status.4. Your paragraph No. 4 (a). I wholly agree that Dominion status mustbe for a Federated India.    ,(&amp;) Your (3) is nearest to mark. As you will have gathered from my 127-S.my aim would be, by satisfying Congress now as to His Majesty&apos;s governments intention for status of India and for achievement as early as possible afterconsultation with India of Dominion status, to go ahead at once (if we could secure acceptance by Moslem minorities and States of that position and of federation) (I) with expansion of my Council: (II) with Federal Section of Act(possibly with minor alterations) at first possible moment thereafter; as a preliminary to (III) consultations (as I see it after the war) with british india and Indian States over technical points involved in achievement ofDominion status, more particularly defence, which could result in proposals toHis Majesty&apos;s Government, backed by Indian opinion, to cover all those points,and in due course to be embodied in a treaty or agreement between new dominion government and His Majesty&apos;s Government.Let me only add on this that I have always felt at the same time that we ought to go very slow. We have already been able to give 6 months of full support in men and material during the war without in any way prejudicingchances of peace in India, and since none of us can tell what the post-war position may be in relation either to Great Britain or India, or world, or what economic or military environment of India may then be, it would be a pity to commit ourselves in detail to anything more of an ultimate and permanent kind than isessential in order to avoid really serious difficulty now. Moreover, we must, asI see it, continue to bear in mind that even though we may reach a settlementnow we are pretty certain to have trouble with&quot; Left later on, and that wecannot exclude the possibility as time goes on of a quite substantial movementof Indian opinion away from Right (with which we shall have made our bargainand upon which we must depend for delivering the goods) and towards the LeftIt might well be better in those circumstances to face serious trouble nowrather than to try to escape it by taking a settlement bad from our point of view.But I think such a scheme which I have put to you, if we could achieve itwould afford the best hope of avoiding immediate trouble, and of securing forIndia, after the war, the constitutional status to which we are committed,consistently with avoiding running of major risks. If you want my view of what we should aim at, as stated above, and in my telegram 127-S, amplified or clarifiedin any respect, will vou let me know, and I will telegraph at once ?&apos; [20724] B
5. I wholly accept objections which you indicate in paragraph No. 5 ofyour telegram to line indicated in your question (2). I take note of your estimateof possible post-war position. I should have thought myself that it was toopessimistic.  But you are in a better position to judge than I am.At any rate, the scheme which I put before you in my 127-S. if we werefortunate enough to be able to get Congress, Moslems and the Princes into line,and to progress on this basis, would make abundantly clear to the world that suchobstacles as existed to achievement of full self-government here were not our fault.6. The other main point emerging out of your telegram which calls, I think,for comment from me, is reference in paragraphs Nos. 2 and 6 to essential necessityof prior agreement between all concerned. Now, as you will have gathered from my 127-S, I, of course, fully share your view that some working agreement betweenthe two major communities in British India and also between British India andthe States is essential if this country is to be able to hold together. It is no goodour blinking that fact, and no good Congress blinking it either. Were we toabdicate in favour of Congress that body would not, for a moment, be able to hold the country against an opposition containing the Moslems and the States.Indeed, what I have throughout felt as one of the main difficulties in considering constitutional progress here is finding of shoulders broad enough tocarry the burden which we shall relinquish. Congress by itself, I am perfectlycertain, could never carry it, and only hope is a system which has got a reasonablemeasure of agreement and support from all parties and interests.7. I am anxious, on the other hand, to avoid stating in terms that absenceof agreement between important sections here will be regarded as decisiveobjection to any form of constitutional advance. Congress would certainlyrepresent acceptance of that position as an encouragement by us to Minoritiesand States to block any progress. The Moslems and Princes would jump atchance of maintaining status quo or of driving an unreasonable bargain as priceof its modification.What I have had in mind, therefore, has been, as suggested in paragraphNo. 8 of my 127-S, to try to bring home to Congress the necessity for someaccommodation with other major interests in this country in the interests of future of India, and to try to persuade the Moslems slightly to abate their claims in the interests of such accommodation, and the States equally to take a reason-able line. I do not underestimate the probable difficulty, but I think this is themost hopeful approach. While, too, I accept the importance of the propositionin the last sentence of your paragraph No. 6, I think that here, too, the wisecourse will be for me to hint at that proposition rather than to state it explicitly.A public statement in these terms might well unduly strengthen Congress by enabling it to hold up Moslems and States as sole obstacle to Indian freedom.There are already suggestions in press that as Jinnah&apos;s attitude is unreason-able, His Majesty&apos;s Government should ignore him and negotiate with Congressonly; and as you know Gandhi&apos;s object has all along been to secure our acceptanceof Congress and himself as only people with whom to negotiate, and to persuadeus to make it clear to other parties in this country that while we would see justicedone to them, they could look for concessions only from Congress.8. In general, I regard this coming talk or talks with Gandhi, which, as you know, I have agreed to start the 5th February, as purely preliminary. You andI ought, I think, in the light of my telegram No. 127-S and my present telegram,to be able to clear ground sufficiently by then. If I come up against unexpectedsnags, I shall, of course, have to ask Gandhi for time. In any case before we can make real progress we shall have to get in Moslems and States which may againtake time.   The first thing is clearly to find out how Gandhi&apos;s mind is working.
APPENDIX B.Preamble to the Government of India Act, 1919.WHEREAS it is the declared policy of Parliament to provide for the increasing association of Indians in every branch of Indian administration, andfor the gradual development of self-governing institutions, with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in British India as an integral part of the empire :And whereas progress in giving effect to this policy can only be achieved by-successive stages, and it is expedient that substantial steps in this directionshould now be taken :And whereas the time and manner of each advance can be determined only by Parliament, upon whom responsibility lies for the welfare and advancement of the Indian peoples :And whereas the action of Parliament in such matters must be guided by theco-operation received from those on whom new opportunities of service will be conferred, and by the extent to which it is found that confidence can be reposedin their sense of responsibility :And whereas concurrently with the gradual development of self-governing-institutions in the Provinces of India it is expedient to give to those Provincesin provincial matters the largest measure of independence of the Government ofIndia which is compatible with the due discharge by the latter of its ownresponsibilities :Be it therefore enacted :Extract from the Instrument of Instructions issued to the Governor-General ofIndia in March 1921.For above all things it is Our will and pleasure that the plans laid by OurParliament for the progressive realisation of responsible government in british india as an integral part of Our Empire may come to fruition, to the end thatBritish India may attain its due place among Our Dominions.Extract from Statement made by the Governor-General (Lord Irivin) with theapproval of His Majesty&apos;s Government on November 1, 1929.The goal of British policy w-as stated in the declaration of August 1917(what is known as the &quot; Montagu Declaration &quot;)* to be that of providing for&quot; the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral partof the British Empire.&quot; As I recently pointed out, my own Instrument of instructions from the King-Emperor expressly states that it is His Majesty&apos;swill and pleasure that the plans laid by Parliament in 1919 should be the means by which British India may attain its due place among His Dominions. ministers of the Crown, moreover, have more than once publicly declared that it is thedesire of the British Government that India should, in the fullness of time,take her place in the Empire in equal partnership with the Dominions. Butin view of the doubts which have been expressed both in Great Britain andIndia regarding the interpretation to the placed on the intentions of the BritishGovernment in enacting the Statute of 1919, I am authorised on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to state clearly that in their judgment it is implicit inthe declaration of 1917 that the natural issue of India&apos;s constitutional progress,as there contemplated, is the attainment of Dominion status.* The relevant portion of this Declaration was incorporated textually in the Preamble to theAct of 1919, with the substitution, however, of &quot; responsible government in British India &quot; for&quot; responsible government in India.&quot;[20724] 15 2
In the full realisation of this policy, it is evidently important that the indian states should be afforded an opportunity of finding their place, and even if wecannot at present exactly foresee on what lines this development may be shaped,it is from every point of view desirable that whatever can be done should be done to ensure that action taken now is not inconsistent with the attainment of theultimate purpose which those, whether in British India or the States, who look forward to some unity of All-India, have in view.Extract from a Speech by Sir Samuel Hoare (Secretary of State for India) onFebruary 6, 1935, on the Second Reading of the Government of India Bill.Why, then, do we not make this clearer in the Bill ? Why in particular dowe not state it in a Preamble to the Bill ? I will tell the House why, and tell themin words which have behind them the considered judgment and the full weightof a Government statement.The House will observe that the Bill, like most modern Bills, contains noPreamble. There have, it is true, been important Acts in the past, among them the Government of India Act, 1919, to which a statement of policy and intentionswas prefixed. There is, however, no need for a Preamble in this case as no newpronouncement of policy or intentions is required. The Preamble to the Act of1919 was described by the joint committee in their report as having &quot; set out finally and definitely the ultimate aims of British rule in India.&quot;The committee, after full consideration, further asserted that &quot; subsequent statements of policy have added nothing to the substance of this declaration,&quot;which they then proceed to quote in full in their report as, in their own words,&quot; settling once and for all the attitude of the British Parliament and people towards the political aspirations of India. If the committee were justified in their statements and the Govern-ment consider that they were fully justified there is surely nothing to be gained by reiterating words which have settled once and for all the attitudeof Parliament to the Indian problem. Moreover, in government, and above all in the government of the Indian Empire, continuity of policyis of the first importance. No Government and no Parliament can treatlightly any statement issued under the authority of their predecessors. But, once the aim of a policy has been clearly determined and accepted, significance attachesnot to its reiteration but to the concrete measures taken in pursuance of it. Theposition of the Government, therefore, is this: They stand firmly by the pledgecontained in the 1919 Preamble, which it is not part of their plan to repeal, andby the interpretation put by the Viceroy in 1929. on the authority of theGovernment of the day, on that Preamble that: &quot; The natural issue of India&apos;s progress as there contemplated, is the attainment of Dominion status.&quot; -The declaration of 1929 was made to remove doubts which had been felt as to themeaning of the Preamble of 1919. There is, therefore, no need to enshrinein an Act words and phrases which would add nothing new to the declaration ofthe Preamble. In saying that we stand by our pledges I include, of course, notonly pledges given to British India, and to Burma as part of British India, butalso our engagements with the Indian States.Rightly understood, the Preamble of 1919, wdiich I repeat will standunrepealed, is a clear statement of the purpose of the British people, and this Billis a definite step, indeed a great stride, forward towards the achievement of thatpurpose. It is by acts and not by words that we claim to be judged. It is clearthat we can only reach the end we have plainly set before ourselves when india has succeeded in establishing the conditions upon which self-government rests,nor will its attainment be delayed by any reluctance on our part to recognise theseconditions when they actually exist.There are difficulties which she has to surmount, but they are difficulties inherent in the Indian problem and not of our creation. If I indicate by way ofexample two of them, it is not, therefore, through any desire to magnify them, but
because it is useless in matters of this kind to refuse to face facts or to assume that, if facts are avoided, they will dissolve. The first and most conspicuousproblem which India has to solve is her cleavages of race, caste and religion.Again, until India can safely assume in much larger degree the responsibilityfor her own effective defence an Indian Government cannot be in the full sense of the word autonomous. These are examples of conditions which cannot beremoved or altered by any provisions in any Act of Parliament or by any actionon our part alone. Our policy, as will be seen from this Bill and the instructions as to the manner in which these provisions which will accompany it are to beapplied, is to do all that we can by sympathetic help and co-operation to enableIndia to overcome these difficulties and ultimately to take her place among thefully self-governing members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. It wasin this spirit that we took upon ourselves the formidable burden and responsibilityof removing one of the chief obstacles to further advance by providing a modus vivendi in regard to the removal of communal differences. Our desire is to lendour help in the spirit of partnership in a great enterprise which may enlist thebest services which this country and India may have it in their power to give.Extract from a Speech by Sir Samuel Iloare in a Debate in the House of commons on October 20. 1939.If hon. Members are to follow its implications they must recall some of themost important discussions which took place in the Debates here on theGovernment of India Act. They centred round the pledge of Dominion status asthe aim of Indian policy. These pledges were repeated time after time. Theywere reaffirmed in very precise terms in the speech with which I introduced theSecond Reading of the Government of India Bill. I made it clear, and I makeit clear again to-day, that we stood by Lord Irwin&apos;s pledge, and when we spoke of Dominion status we meant what we said, and we did not mean some systemof government that deprived India of the full status of equality with the other british Commonwealths. There are no two kinds of Dominion status as some people seem to think. The Dominion status that we contemplated was theDominion status just described by the right hon. Member for Gorton, theDominion status of 1926. I went on to state that Dominion status is not a prizethat is given to a deserving community, but that it is the recognition of facts thatactually exist.As soon as these facts exist in India, and, in my own view, the sooner they exist the better, the aim of our policy will be achieved. If there are difficultiesin the way, they are not of our making.Extract from a Speech by Lord Zetland in the House of Lords on November 7.1939.As the House will have seen from the documents published yesterday, theCongress definitely refuses to consider any concrete plans such as those outlined by the Governor-General unless His Majesty&apos;s Government should be willing first to make a declaration to the effect that India is an independent, nation, and thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government will raise no opposition to her future form ofgovernment being determined without their intervention by a ConstituentAssembly to be foianed on the widest possible basis of franchise, and by agreement in regard to communal representation. The Congress have further consistentlytaken the line, which they still maintain, that the fact that there are racial andreligious minorities in India is of no relevance in that connection, and that ithas always been the intention of the Congress to secure, through the constitution to be framed by Indians themselves, such protection for their rights as may prove acceptable to the minorities.His Majesty&apos;s Government find it impossible to accept this position. Thelong-standing British connection with India has left His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwith obligations towards her which it is impossible for them to shed bydisinteresting themselves wholly in the shaping of her future form of government.
Moreover, one outstanding result of the recent discussions in which the Governor-General has been engaged with representatives (if all Parties and interests inIndia has been to establish beyond doubt the fact that a declaration in the sense proposed, with the summary abandonment by His Majesty&apos;s Government of their position in India, wrould be far from acceptable to large sections of the Indianpopulation.Hut this does not mean that we have in any sense weakened in our determina-tion to assist India by such means as are in our power to reach, without avoidabledelay, the position in the British Commonwealth of Nations to which we arepledged. And let me take this opportunity of removing some doubts andsuspicions which appear to have been felt in India about the reference in therecent Indian debate by my right honourable friend the Lord Privy Seal to &quot; theDominion status of 1926 &quot; as being the status we contemplate for India. Thesuggestion. I understand, has been made that the passage of the Statute of westminster in 1931 has produced for the Dominions to which that Statuteapplies, a status which somehow differs from, and is superior to, the relationshipdescribed in the Balfour Declaration contained in the Report of the ImperialConference of 1926. This House at all events will have no difficulty in believingme when I say there is no foundation for any such suggestion. My right honourable friend referred to &quot; the Dominion status of 1926 &quot; because it was inthat year that the Imperial Conference described the status of the Dominions,and the status so described has not been altered by anything which has sinceoccurred, the Statute of Westminster having merely given legal effect to certainconsequences of the constitutional position as then recognised.Extract from a Speech by the Governor-General of India delivered at theOrient Club, Bombay, an January 10, 1940.As you know, in response to requests for a clarification of the aims of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and of their intentions towards India, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have made it clear, both through statements issued by myself andin Parliament, that their objective for India is full Dominion status dominion status, too, of the Statute of Westminster variety; that so far as the inter-mediate period is concerned (and it is their desire to make that intermediateperiod the shortest practicable), they are ready to consider the reopening of thescheme of the Act of 1935 so soon as practicable after the war with the aid of Indian opinion; that they are prepared in the meantime, subject to such localadjustments between the leaders of the great communities as may be necessary toensure harmonious working, and as an immediate earnest of their intention, to expand the Executive Council of the Governor-General by the inclusion of asmall number of political leaders; and that they are ready and anxious to giveall the help they can to overcome the difficulties that confront us and that confrontIndia to-day.****** *His Majesty&apos;s Government are not blind nor can we be blind here to thepractical difficulties involved in moving at one step from the existing constitu-tionai position into that constitutional position which is represented by dominion status. But here again I can assure you that their concern and mine is to spareno effort to reduce to the minimum the interval between the existing state of thingsand the achievement of Dominion status.The offer is there. The responsibility that falls on the great political parties and their leaders is a heavy one, and one of which they are, I know, fullyconscious.They have helped me in the past. I ask to-day that they will help me again and help India, and 1 ask for their co-operation and their assistance interminating, at as early a date as possible, a state of things which all who havefaith in the virtue of constitutional progress must deplore.
