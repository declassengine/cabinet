J3 E C R E T.Iff. P.   (0)  (40)44.COPY NO.WAR CABINET.STATEMENT OF POLICY ON COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT AND welfare and ON COLONIAL RESEARCH.Memorandrirn &quot;by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1.        The War Cabinet will recall that when on the30th of January I brought before them the question of thepublication of the Report of the West India RoyalCommission (W.M.  (40)  27th Conclusions, Minute 2) I referredto certain proposals for general Colonial development which I hoped shortly to submit for approval, and whichI proposed that we should announce on the day of the Report&apos;apublication.        The War Cabinet have decided a.gainstpublishing the Report, though they may still decide to publish a summary containing the Royal Commission&apos;sRecommendations.        I am circulating such a summary in aseparate paper,  (&apos;W.P.(G)  (40)  45). If the Cabinet dodecide to publish the recommendations and if they are inagreement with the proposals contained in this memorandum,I suggest that the Royal Commission&apos;s Recommendations andthe Statement of Policy attached to this memorandum shouldbe published on the same day,  i.e. next Tuesday afternoon,February 20th.

2.        In the two or three years &quot;before the outbreak ofthe war there had been a growing volume of criticism of our colonial administration, and increasing attention was being given in Parliament and elsewhere to the needs and problems of the Colonies.        This was due in part to the occurrence Of riots and disturbances in certaindependencies and the wide publicity given to them, and inpart to a series of reports, such as the Report onNutrition in the Colonies, which showed clearly thelow standard of living that is generally prevalent andthe extent of the poverty and ill-health that exist in them.      It was agreed that the situation in the west indies called for the appointment of a Royal Commission,but while there were special difficulties in the west indies, criticism was not confined to the position there,      There was a widespread feeling that all wasnot well with the Colonial Empire.        Some unfavourablecomparisons were made between our own administration andthat of ether Colonial powers, and it was urged on all sides that bold measures of amelioration and reformwere required.3.        Though I have long felt that there was some justification for these criticisms, I should like to say we a sentence that in my view the officers of theColonial Office and the Colonial Services have done a greatdeal of remarkably fine work in recent years, by way of improving conditions in the Colonies, with the means ?, their disposal.     What was lacking was adequate means.For many months before the outbreak of v/ar, this situationbad been giving me much concern, and I was convinced thatthe

the time had come when His Majesty&apos;s government must he prepared to spend considerably more money on development,in its broadest sense, in the Colonial Empire.        The Coloniesare mainly or wholly dependent on agriculture:    few of thempossess substantial mineral resources or can draw on the wealthassociated with manufacturing industries, and generally theycannot, out of their own resources, provide in any adequatedegree the services which are now normally a part of civilizedgovernment.      To a few of the poorest Colonies grants-in-aid aremade, but these are only sufficient to make their budgets balanceon an absolutely minimum standard. Assistance has also beenmade available from the Colonial Development Fund, and colonial governments have, I know, a lively appreciation of the help thusgiven to them.     But definite limits are placed on the projects for which the Fund can be used:    in particular, it has not beenpossible to give assistance from it for any general expansion of services, such as education or health, but only for specificschemes, chiefly of a capital nature.       Despite muchconstructive work during recent years, it must, I- fear, beadmitted that the standard of services is still such as tojustify much of the criticism that has been made.4.       When war broke out I had, therefore, been about to propose to the Cabinet the expansion of the existing colonial development Fund to a much higher figure than its existing 1,000,000 a year, with an equivalent expansion of the objectsfor which the money could be used.      In war conditions some modification of this plan was obviously necessary, but Isoon came to the conclusion that it would be a great mistake to drop it altogether. The type of expenditure involved will not require the use of foreign currency,nor the diversion of man power and materials from direct war purposes

purposes.      Indeed, insofar as it leads directly to increased production, it cc-n be jus til led, on the narrowest definition,as a part of ./ar war effort0     The expansion of the work ofagricultural and labour departments&apos;, for instance, would comeinto this categoryo5.       Apart from that, however, an active policy of colonial development is, in my view,  justified on widergrounds.      A continuance of the present state of affairs wouldbe wrong on merits, and it provides our enemies and criticswith an admirable subject for propaganda in neutral countries and elsewhere.      The Report of the West India Royal commission would have provided them with some valuable ammunition, andthe War Cabinet will remember that in proposing thepublication of the Commission&apos;s Report, I made it clear thatI would not advise such a course unless at the same time anannouncement were made that adequate remedial measures wouldbe undertaken and pressed forward with vigour and determination.6.       Nor, although there is a ferment of loyalty inthe Colonial Empire at present, can we overlook thepossibility of trouble there later on.      The war will bring agreat deal of dislocation to colonial markets and an increasein the cost of imports without, save in a few territories,any corresponding increase in wealth.     In particular, thereis serious danger of trouble in the West Indies if no action is taken to implement the recommendations of the RoyalCommission.     Moreover, it is, I feel, of the greatest importance that at the end of the war, when the colonialquestion is bound to be much discussed, we should be in aposition to face with a reasonable measure of confidence anycriticisms that may be made of our record as a Colonial power.

7.        For all these reasons I felt that the originalplan should proceed as far as possible, and I have therefore been discussing with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in thelast few months the details of my proposals, for which, withhis concurrence, I now ask the approval cf the War Cabinet.yha,t is proposed is, briefly, that the existing colonial development Fund should be brought to an end, and that inits place there should be a new Vote for Colon-al development and Welfare:    provision would be made or this Vote up to a sumof  5P000,000 a year for ten years, and out of this grantswould be made to Colonial Governments:    capital grants wouldbe made for particular schemes of development, as is done atpresent from the existing Colonial Development Fund, and inadditional recurrent grants would be made over a period of years to enable the Colonial Governments to expand their development and welfare services.        In order to secure proper economy andto encourage a sense of financial responsibility,  the latter-grants would probably normally be made on a percentage basis.8.        I do not anticipate that the full figure of 5,000,000 will be spent for the first two or three years, but Iconsider it essential that it should be announced from thebeginning that that sum will be available if and when required,so that Colonial Governments may lay their plans accordingly.9.        With the disappearance of the colonial development Fund,  the existing statutory Advisory Committeewould also cease to exist, and the responsibility for makingthe new grants would rest with the Secretary of State andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.      But I would propose toestablish a new Advisory Committee on Colonial Development and welfare composed partly of official and partly of unofficial members.

1C.      I also propose that in addition a Vote for ColonialResearch should &quot;oe established, with fluids not exceeding 500,000 a year, to promote research in all its aspects on matters affecting the Colonial Empire.     The importance of this was strongly urged by Lord Hailey in his &quot;African Survey&quot;, and thefield for research is great, both in sociological matters, e.g.questions of land tenure, and in agriculture and health.     Aseparate Colonial Research Advisory Committee would be appointed with the strongest scientific representation obtainable.11.      Within the fx^amework of these proposals it will bepossible to meet the cost (some  1,hCG,C00 per annum) of rhemain recommendations of the West India Royal Commission for development ar.d wel fa re.      But, whilst making this provision, Ido not propose that we should now commit ourselves to accept in detail the various recommendations of the Royal Commission.I am in consultation with the West Indian Governors on these,and shall make proposals regarding them as soon as these consultations are complete.      It is desirable, however, as an earnest of our good intentions, that we should announce straightaway our acceptance in principle of the Royal Commission&apos;s mostimportant recommendations, for the establishment of a central organisation for developing welfare services in the West Indiesas a whole, presided over by a Comptroller and staff by medical., housing and other advisers of high qualification,and also for the appointment of an Inspector-General ofAgriculture for the West Indies.      These recommendations(which are set out in the Summary of Recommendations attachedto my memorandum W.P.  (G)  (UO) 1+5) have the unanimoussupport of the West Indian Governors.      For the rest I thinkit

it sufficient at this stage to express the governments intention to act in the spirit of the recommendations as awhole.      The first paragraph of the draft Statement ofPolicy, which has heen drafted on the assumption that wepublish the recommendations, deals with the West Indiansituation, and the following paragraphs set out at lengththe general scheme of colonial development.12.     The South African High Commission Territories,for which the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs is responsible, will be included in the scope of these proposals.It is not, however, intended that they should apply toNewfoundlands     Newfoundland will continue, as at present, to rely for its development and reconstruction expenditure onprovision from the annual grant-in-aid, including such itemsas have hitherto been met from the Colonial development fund.     The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agrees with these proposals.13.      I therefore ask the War Cabinets approval ofthe draft Statement of Policy containing the followingsubstantial proposals:-(a) that there should be a central organisation in theWest Indies, presided over by a Comptroller and staffed withexpert advisers, for planning the development of welfare services;    and that an Inspector-General of Agriculture forthe West Indies should be appointed:(b) that the Government, while not committing themselvesto particular proposals, should announce their intentionto act as early as possible, in the spirit of the WestIndia Royal Commission^ recommendations as a whole:(c) that legislation should be introduced to replace theexisting Colonial Development Fund by new arrangements under

which up to  5,000,000 a year will he provided for 10 years for Colonial Development and welfare:    and that the help ofan Advisory Committee, pertly official and partly unofficial,should he enlisted in planning expenditure from this source:(d)      that a separate allocation, up to  500,000 a year,should he made for Colonial Research;    and that a ColonialResearch Advisory Committee should similarly he appointed..Colcniol Office.February 13 th, 191+0.

DRAFT STATEMENT OF POLICY ON COLONIAL development and WELFARE AND ON COLONIAL research . The West India Royal Commission^ Recommendations arebeing published to-day, and His Majestys Government wish toexpress their sincere gratitude to the members of the commission for the thoroughness and the constructive spirit in which they haveperformed their task. The members of the Commission express thehope that their recommendations &quot; may commend themsleves to your Majesty&apos;s Government even in the dark days which have nowbefallen us.&quot; Their hope is justified. It has been assumed in some quarters that action on the recommendations would be postponedtintil after the war; but the Government purpose no such defay.Following upon consultations with the West Indian Administrations,they accept in principle the important proposal that there should be a central organisation, presided over by a Comptroller and staffedwith technical officers of high qualification, for planning, in consulta-tion with the Governments concerned, the further development of welfare services in the West Indies. They also accept the proposalfor the appointment of an Inspector-General of Agriculture for these colonies. The exact relationship between the Comptroller and the inspector-General, and between both officers and the authorities inthe Colonies and at home, as well as the manner in which the mone3-&apos;required for their work shall be made available, are matters forfurther consideration. The Government are still consulting the west indian Administrations on the other recommendations made by theRoyal Commission but, whilst they cannot therefore commit them-selves now to accept particular proposals, they are anxious to act asearty as possible in the spirit of the recommendations as a whole,and the decisions on general Colonial policy announced below include provision for expenditure in the West Indies from the UnitedKingdom Exchequer on a scale approximating to the amount involved in the Commission^ recommendations for development and welfare. A further statement on policy in the West Indies will bemade when the consultations now in progress have been concluded.2. While the Royal Commission have been investigating thesituation in the West Indies the Government have been examining the position in the Colonial Empire generally. Conclusions in prin-ciple on the further development of Colonial policy were reachedsome time ago, but it was thought desirable to await the result ofthe West Indian enquiry before taking final decisions. The time hasnow come to announce the Government&apos;s policy on the broadquestions of development and welfare in the Colonial Empire as a
whole. Though the unhappy intervention of war may inevitablyaffect the rate of advance, the Government propose to proceed withtheir policy of development as far and as fast as the exigencies ofthe times permit.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government are trustees for the well-being ofthe peoples of the Colonial Empire, and the spontaneous andwholehearted support given by the inhabitants of every territory tothe common war effort is the best testimony to their own apprecia-tion of the way in which this trust is being discharged. The primaryaim of Colonial policy is to protect and advance the interests ofthe inhabitants of the Colonies (in which term are included forthe purpose of this statement, Protectorates and Mandated Terri-tories). Much has already been accomplished, but there is room forfurther active development of the natural resources of the variousterritories so as to provide their people with improved standards of life. Some of the Colonies can make, and have made, withoutoutside help, great progress in strengthening their economic positions;and they are improving, as time goes on, the social services thatminister to the well-being of the people as a whole. In some terri-tories larger revenues could be raised without injustice by adjustment of taxation ; and considerably heavier local taxation has in fact beenaccepted in most of the Colonies since the outbreak of war. Animprovement of the Government machinery and a reinforcement ofthe personnel of the development services would in many Coloniesresult in more successful economic expansion.4. Nevertheless, if full and balanced development is to be obtained,and if Colonial Governments are to be placed in a position to maintainadministrative, technical and social services at proper standards,some assistance from outside is necessary at this stage. Few of theColonies have the good fortune to possess substantial mineralwealth and in comparatively few are there manufacturing industries of any magnitude. The majority are wholly, or almost wholly,dependent on the more limited resources derived from agriculture.The value of agricultural products varies widely from year to year as conditions fluctuate in the world market, with the result thatColonial revenues provide an unreliable basis for a policy of steadydevelopment. In some cases the position is aggravated by a heavy burden of indebtedness. However able their Government, howeverefficient their economic administration, many Colonies cannotfinance, out of their own resources, the research and survey work,the schemes of major capital enterprise, and - the expansion of administrative or technical staffs which are necessary for their fulland vigorous development. Nor can they always afford, in theabsence of such development, an adequate standard of health and education services.5. Much has been done towards remedying the situation. It isnot merely that when Colonial Governments have faced deficits in
the past they have recei%&apos;ed assistance from the United kingdom excequer, which has amounted during the last ten years to &quot;12,000,000.* More important, a Colonial Development Fund was established by an Act of 1929, for financing by grant or loan various schemes for economic development in the Colonies. Each yearconsiderable payments have been made from the Fund, totallingsome  5,000,0001 altogether over the past decade, while commit-ments for the future amount to an additionaf  1,600,000.f6. The Government now propose to invite Parliament to approvean extension of this policy, and to remove certain limiting andhampering conditions that are attached to expenditure from theexisting Fund. The object in view, when the Fund was constituted,was &quot; to promote commerce with, or industry in, the United King-dom,&quot; an end which it was hoped to achieve by assisting the develop-ment of agriculture and industry in the Colonies. Certain specificobjects on which expenditure could be incurred were enumerated.Other objects of no less importance were not included ; for example,education (apart from technical education) was outside the scope ofthe Act. The emphasis was throughout on material development.The intention of the Act was primarily to provide assistance towardscapital schemes, though assistance towards recurrent expenditure was not in terms excluded. This intention has been followed, and grants towards recurrent expenditure have not normally been authorised ; when occasionally they have been given, they have beenmade for short periods onky. The existence of the Fund has notinvolved any departure from the old principle that a Colony shouldhave only those services which it can afford to maintain out of itsown resources. This principle now calls for revision, and theGovernment propose that in appropriate cases money&apos;&apos; from the new sources, which they have it in mind to provide, should be madeavailable for the maintenance of important works or services over asubstantial period of years.7. They propose to introduce legislation to replace the colonial development Fund, which is limited to a maximum of  1,000,000a year, by new arrangements providing in a new Vote in the estimates for assistance to Cotonial Governments^ up to a maximum of 5,000,000 a year for ten years. This assistance will be availablenot only for schemes involving capital expenditure necessary for colonial development in the widest sense but also for assistance in meeting recurrent expenditure in the Colonies on certain services* This figure does not include expenditure on security in Palestine andTrains-Jordan:f These figures do not include payments and commitments in respect of new foundland.J The arrangements now contemplated will apply also to the three high commission Territories in South Africa which fall within the sphere of theDominions Office.(c 30999) b 2
such as agriculture, education, health and housing. In planningexpenditure from this new source the Government will enlist the help of a Colonial Development and Welfare Advisory Committee,which will be composed partly of official and partly of unofficial members.S. The subject of research calls for separate treatment. Hithertoexpenditure on various forms of Colonial research has receivedassistance from the Colonial Development Fund, but the government feel it desirable that special arrangements should be made in future for giving assistance of this nature. They have had access in thepast, in dealing with questions of Colonial research, to the advice of scientific and technical experts in this country ; but they are anxiousto place the system on a wider and more regular basis, and theyconsider that this object can best be achieved by the establishmentof a Colonial Research Advisory Committee and by the allocation ofa separate sum for Colonial Research up to a maximum of  500,000a year. In reaching this decision they had in mind the proposal forspecial provision for research made by Lord Hailej&apos; in his &quot; AfricanSurvey &quot; and they take this opportunity of acknowledging their debt to him for the suggestion.9. The intention is that the sums of  &quot;5,000,000 and  500,000a year respectively should be specified in the proposed legislation asmaximum figures. It is not expected that, in either case, this scale of expenditure will be attained at once ; indeed it is improbable that conditions will permit of its being reached at any time duringthe war. In any event it must take time to frame careful plans ofdevelopment and research on the scale that will now be possible,and to translate such plans into full practical operation. Thesemaximum figures have been reached after estimating what expendi-ture seems desirable and practicable for a reasonable period of years ahead. They will be subject to review from time to time, and shouldexperience show that they are insufficient it will always be open toParliament to increase them. So far as concerns the provision for development and welfare, the position will have to be reviewedbefore the expiry of the initial ten-year period.10. The first emphasis in this much enlarged policy of colonial development will be on the improvement of the economic positionof the Colonies. That is the primary requirement, upon whichadvance in other directions is largely consequential. It is by economic development that Colonies will be p&apos;.faced in a positionto devote their resources, to the maximum extent possible, to theprovision of those Government and other services which the interestsof their people demand. Assistance from United Kingdom funds should be effectively related to what the Colonies can do for them-selves. For this purpose it is essential that there should become-ordination of effort on the part both of the Government at home
Dand of the Colonial Governments. Proper machinery and adequatepersonnel both for planning and for carrying out plans should beestablished in the United Kingdom as well as in each of the Colonies,and there should be a regular liaison between the authorities athome and overseas.11. With these aims in view a certain expansion has taken placerecently in the Colonial Office. An additional Assistant UnderSecretary of State has been appointed. The Economic Departmentof the Office has been strengthened. Since the outbreak of waran honorary Business Adviser to the Secretary of State has beenappointed, and it will be for consideration at the end of the warwhether such a post should be established on a more permanent basis. So far as concerns the work of developing such services ashealth, education and housing, a separate Social Services Departmentof the Office was set up some months ago.12. As regards co-operation between the Government at homeand the Governments overseas, it has been a growing practice for members of the Colonial Office to visit Colonies either on specialmissions or for general consultation with the local authorities.The Secretary of State&apos;s technical Adviseis spend a considerable part of their time on tour in the Colonies, and heads of departments in the Office also pay occasional visits overseas. The contacts so made are of value both to the Governors and to the Colonial Office,and it may well be that the preparation and execution of develop-ment programmes will make make more regular travel desirable.13. In the Colonies the problems of development touch uponthe work of officers in various departments, such as administrative officers, both at headquarters and in the districts, and the technical officers in the agricultural, veterinary, medical and other services.There is a need for machinery to provide complete co-co-ordination between the efforts of these separate departmental staffs so as toensure that development proceeds on a balanced and comprehensive plan. The Government do not suggest that there should be anyuniform system of co-ordination throughout the Colonial Empire ;still Jess would they desire to impose any set pattern from downing street. It must be appreciated that the circumstances, resources and needs of individual territories respond to no common formula,and that no rigid uniformity is practicable or would be appropriate.Differing conditions between different territories will certainlyrequire some variation in the methods of dealing with this problem.Nevertheless, the need of co-ordination is clear, and it will be theobject of the Government to ensure that Colonies are furnished,according to their several requirements, with adequate staff and machinery for this purpose.14. With the requisite financial assistance once assured, theGovernment would propose to invite Colonial Governments to
prepare development programmes for a period of years ahead. Incertain of the Colonies long-term programmes of developmenthave already been drawn up and are in effective operation ; in otherssuch programmes are in the course of preparation ; it is the Govern-menfs hope that all Colonial Administrations may find it possibleto embark on long-range plans for necessary development. war conditions may retard to some extent the execution of such plans,but it is essential, as a preliminary to constructive, comprehensive and consistent progress, that considered programmes should bedrawn up without loss of time. These programmes will then beconsidered by the Colonial Office and the Advisory Committees inLondon, who will be able to take a comprehensive view of theproposals for the Colonial Empire as a whole.15. From London there will be assistance and guidance, but nospirit of dictation. The new policy of development will involve no derogation from the rights and privileges of local legislatures.Nor will the fact that a Colony receives assistance under the policyentail upon it the system of financial control which is now associatedwith the receipt of grants-in-aid. The whole effort will be one ofco-operation between the authorities in the Colonies and those athome ; there must be ready recognition that conditions vary greatlyfrom Colony to Colony, and that Colonial Governments, who bestknow the needs of their own territories, should enjoy a wide latitudein the initiation and execution of policies, the primary purpose ofwhich is to promote the prosperity and happiness of the peoples of the Colonial Empire.February, 1940.(C36999)    125   2 4&quot;
