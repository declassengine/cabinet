They were favourably inclined in principle to the suggestion that in the circumstances it would be cf valueif the Recommendations only were to be published with a statementof Government policy indicating that early and effective action would be taken to improve conditions in the West Indies.     But itwas decided that before a definite decision v/as taken regardingthe publication of the Recommendations they should be laid beforethe Cabinet.2.      I took an early opportunity of making known thedecision of the War Cabinet to Lord Moyne and such other membersof the Commission as were readily available, and I discussed thematter with Sir Walter Citrine immediately on his return from finland.      The members of the Commission were disappointed at theCabinet&apos;s decision, but, provided that they are not associatedin any way with that decision, they are willing to help theGovernment as far as lies in their power, and they agreed toPrepare a statement of their Recommendations which could bepublished

published on the Commissions own authority,  in case theGovernment decided in favour of publication.     The statement which they have prepared is attached to this memorandum.3.      It is true that the considerations which led   theWar Cabinet to decide against the publication of the full report apply in some degree to the publication of therecommendations by themselves.      The Commission&apos;s criticisms of conditions in the West Indies, which it was feared wouldmake good material for German propaganda, and which arepositively and strongly expressed in the full Report, arealso inevitably implied to some extent in the comprehensiverecommendations.4.      But I feel that the balance cf advantage is strongly in favour of publishing them.      In the firuf. place,  if theproposals on Colonial development in my memorandum .P. (G) (40) 44 are applied, v/e are in fact proceeding to actin the spirit of the Commission&apos;s recommendations, and the criticism by inference which I have mentioned could be largely drawn from that fact.      In the second place,  I am confident that the publication cf the recommendations will do much to allay an inevitable feeling in the West Indies thatthe suppression of the full Report means that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have no intention of acting energetically to remedy conditions there.     Without such publication, whateverwe de would be represented as falling short of theCommission&apos;s hidden recommendations, and no official assurance from here would avail much in countering such a belief.     Astatement of the recommendations, prepared by theCommissioners themselves, and issued over their signatures,would

would be the &quot;best corrective for this kind ofmisrepresentation.     Moreover,  there will be great advantages in the long run, whatever the initial reactionsmay be,  in having a published programme to whichpolitically minded West Indians may accustom themselves, andwhich may tend to bring an element of realism into theirtoo often cloudy and impractical aspirations.5.      I feel sure that there would be very serious criticism in Parliament and in the press in this country if we suppressed the recommendations as well as the main body of the Report.      I also think that we are under aconsiderable obligation to the Commissioners themselves fortheir action.      They have taken very well a decision whichhas naturally been disappointing to them,  and byacquiescing in the publication of the recommendations,  theymay lay themselves open to the charge, however unfounded,of being parties to the decision to suppress the full report, a decision with which several of them are actually in disagreement.6.      I ask the War Cabinet therefore to approve thepublication of the recommendations as in the annexeddocument.      The question of publication is of course bound up with that of issuing    simultaneously a statement ofGovernment policy on the recommendations.      This is dealtwith in my paper W.P.(G)(40) 44 in which I make proposalsfor a statement of policy on(l)    the recommendations of the West India RoyalCommission, and(2)    development and welfare in the Colonial Empiregenerally.M.M.Colonial Office,13th February, 1940.3.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WEST INDIAROYAL commission. West Indian Welfare Fund1. There is a pressing need for large expenditure on social servicesand development which not even the least poor of the West IndianColonies can hope to undertake from their own resources. Wetherefore recommend the establishment for this purpose of a west indian Welfare Fund to be financed by an annual grant of  1,000,000from the Imperial Exchequer for a period of 20 years, and of a specialorganisation to administer this fund under the charge of aComptroller. The objects of the Fund should be to finance schemesfor the general improvement of education, the health services,housing and slum clearance, the creation of labour departments,the provision of social welfare facilities, and land settlement, apartfrom the cost of purchase of land.2. We consider it essential that the new organisation should beset up within the West Indies but be independent of the local governments. Its head, the Comptroller of the West Indian WelfareFund, should constantly review the social problems of the west indies, be available to advise the colonial administrations on theirproblems, and submit an annual report which would help to focuspublic attention in this country on progress in the West Indies.The Comptroller should be responsible to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, and have the right of direct access to him. His principalduties would be : (1) to work out, with the aid of experts to be attached tohim and in consultation with the local Governments concerned,long-term programmes of social reform for submission to theSecretary of State ;(2) to consider similar schemes submitted by local Govern-ments whether on their own initiative or after consultationwith his experts ;(3) to control the West Indian Welfare Fund and to approvegrants from it for expenditure by West Indian governments on schemes which he has accepted as conforming to the general programme approved by the Secretary of State ;(4) to supervise, through his staff, the administration ofthese grants ; and(5) to submit annually to the Secretary of State a report,in form suitable for presentation to Parliament, on the work carried out under his supervision during the preceding year.
3. It will be seen that, subject to conformity with schemes approved by the Secretary of State, the Comptroller will have widediscretion in the allocation of funds from the West fndian WelfareFund, and his operations will not be subject to such detailed scrutinj-by the Treasury as are the estimates of colonies which are in receiptof grants-in-aid. This we regard as of great importance, and weconsider that the aims of effective social development and in thelong run of true economy will best be served by choosing a capableand experienced administrator for the post of Comptroller and giving him wide power to settle points of detail without reference. any steps should in general be taken which would obviate delay withoutimpairing a proper system of financial control.4. Although the exact composition of his staff will vary fromtime to time according to the nature of the schemes on which it is decided to embark, we should expect them to include from the outset experts on education, finance, health, housing, income tax,labour and social welfare, a civil engineer and a statistician. we assume that in the consideration of appropriate schemes full use would be made of the services of the Inspector-General of Agriculture,whose appointment we recommend elsewhere.5. The expenses of the new organisation, which may, when thescheme is fully developed, amount to  100,000 per annum, shouldnot be borne by the West Indian Welfare Fund itself but by theImperial Exchequer. At the same time, we consider it reasonablethat, in view of the great disparity between the rates of direct taxation in the West Indies and in this country, the West IndianColonies should make their contribution by bringing their rates of income tax more into line with the pre-war rates payable here. Wedo not recommend that further burdens should be laid on the payerof indirect taxation.6. This is in our view a fundamental recommendation, and isintended to provide the machinery and funds for accomplishingthe objects of social policy which follow.2. Social Services(i) Education7. The objectives of Educational policy should be as follows : (a) Steps should be taken to ensure that all teachers havehad an adequate training at some properly organised trainingcollege. This will involve the provision of facilities at thetraining colleges in the larger Colonies for students from thoseColonies (the Leewaixl Islands, the Windward Islands andBritish Honduras) for which separate training colleges on an
adequate scale are not a practical proposition. In consequence,steps should be taken to eliminate the pupil-teacher system and, to cover the period until all teachers have been trained,supervisory teachers should be employed to superintend and advise the untrained teachers already in employment.(b) The provision of sufficient school accommodation shouldbe actively proceeded with, special attention being paid to questions of design, the preservation of a balance between theneeds of urban and rural areas, the use of local materials where possible, the provision of playground space and of water-supplyand adequate sanitary equipment.(c) Additional equipment should be provided for manyschools, and in some places the complete replacement of badly-designed equipment is necessary. The supply of equipment for physical training should not be overlooked. Text-books and school stationery should at once be provided free, costsbeing reduced by direct large-scale purchase by EducationDepartments.(d) The literary curriculum in the primary schools requires to be simplified and brought more into relation with the environ-ment of the children. Stress should be laid on the formation ofhabits of clear and connected speech. The primary curriculumshould in its later stages include instruction in hygiene, includingdiet; manual and agricultural teaching for boys ; and domestictraining and child welfare instruction for girls. More juniorsecondary schools should be established giving training&quot;*anpractical subjects : these schools to be treated on an equal footing with the more academic secondary schools as regardsaccommodation, equipment and teaching staff.(e) The use and production of educational films should be investigated. Consideration should be given to the formationof a library of suitable films in, say, Trinidad, for use throughoutthe West Indies, and to the employment for a period of an expert on the production of documentary films who could visit the West Indies and instruct local personnel on the productionof simple films of local subjects.(/) In order to enhance the value of the West Indian wirelesstransmitter or transmitters recommended elsewhere, schoolreceivers should be provided, which could also pla.y an important part in adult education.(g) In the special circumstances of these Colonies, the schoolsshould play an important part as the centres for adult education in the ordinary sense, for instruction in agriculture and hygieneand for lending library services.(h) Educational policy as a whole should be under the supervision of some one officer in each Colon3&apos;, and should be animportant charge of the official Standing Committee for social welfare of which the establishment is recommended elsewhere.
In addition, education boards, which should be advisory only,and include a strong unofficial element, should be formed forthe mutual enlightenment of Government and public opinion.(i) The primary school age should be restricted to 6-12,but only conditionally on, and side by side with, the establish-ment of junior secondary schools for ages 12-15 and of playcentres or, in certain cases, of nursery schools for children under 6.(j) The literary curriculum should remain the same for girlsas for boys, but girls&apos; vocational training (domestic science,child welfare, etc.) should begin at a somewhat earlier stage.In secondary education, provision should be made to enablegirls to compete for scholarships on equal terms with boys.Facilities should generally be provided for post-primaryvocational training for girls on the lines of the Carnegie TradeSchool in Georgetown, British Guiana.(k) There should be general provision of school meals, freewhere the economic circumstances of the children warrant it,and it should be possible to supply clothes for poor children.Some of these might be made at the schools.(I) In schools at present managed by the Denominations,if salaries are paid by the Government, complete control in staff matters should be assumed by Government ; and new-schools provided wholly from public funds should be in all respects administered by Government. The existing facilitiesfor religious instruction in Government schools should bemaintained.(m) The staff of the Comptroller of the West Indian WelfareFund should include an educational expert.While some of these recommendations should be put into effect at an early date we recognise that many of them can only be appliedgradually and may require modification in the light of experience.(ii) Public Health8. We recommend : (a) the appointment of a Medical Adviser to the Comptrollerof the West Indian Welfare Fund. He should advise on healthpolicies for the West Indies ; and the unification of medical services and the co-ordination of other health activities as recommended below should be among the first subjects to engage his attention ;
(b) the unification of the medical services of the british west Indies, with the object of affording a better career tomembeis of that service, rendeiing possible an increase in thenumber of specialists and a wider use of their services, providing a more efficient and more economically run medical serviceboth for the prevention and for the cure of disease and fosteringa comprehensive view of the health problems of the entirearea ;(c) the centralisation of certain medical institutions, notonly within each colony but as between neighbouring groups of colonies, should be undeitaken, both to secure greater efficiency and economy in the treatment of the sick and to render possiblemuch better training facilities for all classes of medical personnel in curative medicine. This reform would involve the o:ganisa-tion of the outlying hospitals as collecting stations, and theprovision of adequate ambulance and stietcher services. Thereis a special need for the centralisation as between colonies of mental and leper institutions, and particularly for the trainingof sanitary inspectors and health visitors ;(d) the creation of at least one School of Hygiene in theWest Indies, for research and teaching in preventive medicine ;(e) the formulation of long-term health policies, whichshould form part of the wider social welfare programmes of thevarious Colonies, and should be framed not by the MedicalDepartments in isolation, but in consultation with otherDepartments, particularly of Labour, Agriculture and education and with Social Welfare Officers ;(/) the partial reorganisation of the medical services tosecure the development of a preventive outlook, the provisionof a relative increase in well-trained auxiliary staff such assanitary inspectors, health visitors, district nurses and dis-pensers, the centralisation of medical institutions (see (c) above)and the provision of better facilities for medical treatment inthe rural areas and for certain sections of the urban population.In this connexion the possibility of an extension of contributoryhealth insurance schemes on the basis of a carefully selectedmembership should be studied by the Medical Adviser (see (a)above) in consultation with Governments ;(g) immediate progress with certain definite preventivemeasures, including improved housing, general sanitation, thecontrol of malarial areas, the development of maternity and child welfare work, venereal disease clinics, school medical services, and the better education of the public in health,including nutrition, both in and out of school;(h) greater attention should be paid to providing a betterbalanced diet for the population in general, and in this matter
the public health, agricultural and education departments should consist-operate closely. It will be necessary in paiticular to incieasethe output of meat, milk, poultry, eggs, fish and fiesh vegetables ;(*&apos;) increased attention should be paid to the training ofmuses by such methods as the appointment of sister-tutorsand the centralisation of training institutions.(iii) Housing9. We recommend :-(a) generally, that, where they do not exist, powers shouldbe taken to control the siting of new housing and that this control should be exeicised with regard to considerations ofhealth, sanitation and water-supply ; and that great care should be taken to maintain a balance between rural and urbanhousing ;(b) for urban housing, that powers should be taken, wherethey do not ah eady exist, to condemn and clear bad slum housing,no compensation being paid except in cases of proved andextreme hardship and then only under rigid safeguards ; that legislation and procedure should follow those of the UnitedKingdom, unless it is certain that United Kingdom provisionsaie inappropriate ; that West Indian Governments should haveeasily-applied powers for the compulsoiy acquisition of land for housing ;(c) for rural housing, that in the case of estate housing,estates should provide the land, including vegetable plots, and give reasonable security of tenure, and the houses should bebuiJt under approved schemes financed by Government at lowrates of interest, rent being chaiged  gainst a corresponding increase in wages in those cases where, as is usual, rent is now only nominal. As between ranges and separate cottages, while on general grounds we prefer cotteges, reformed ranges are suitable for unmarried men and small ranges limited to fourdwellings might be permitted for families where there are.stiong health or other reasons for this course. A survey ofestate housing should be made and where possible peasanthousing should be included in it ; and demolition of peasant&apos;shouses not ordeied unless either the peasant can afford to replaceor Government is prepared to help with rebuilding;(d) that, since the large programme recommended willrtquiie supervision by persons with qualifications not availablein the West Indies, the following appointments should bemade to the staff of the Comptroller of the West Indian WelfareFund : - - &apos; (1) (temporary) an expert to organise enquiry into methodsof building and types of houses ;
(2) a permanent advisory officer with wide knowledge of town planning;(3) an officer in charge of the actual building having initiative,drive, and experience of large-scale building in theUnited Kingdom.(iv) Labour and Trade Unions10. We recommend : (a) as regards Trade Unionism, the enactment, where theyare not already in force, of laws to protect Unions from actions for damages consequent on strikes, the legalisation of peacefulpicketing (pickets being given access in reasonable numbers to workers both at the gates of the factories and at their homes),the compulsory registration of Trade Unions and audit of theirfunds (the latter duty could reasonably be undertaken free of charge by Governments) ;(b) to cover the period before Trade Unions are developed to the point at which they can play a decisive part in the regulation of wages and conditions of employment, action by governments in this direction through the medium of LabourDepartments or Officers. These organisations should be assisted by Advisory Boards representative of employers andemployed with an impartial Chairman ;(c) that the staff of the Comptroller of the West IndianWelfare Fund should include a Labour Adviser who should maintain close liaison with the Labour Officers and departments in all the West Indian Colonies ;(d) that a Labour Department should be established withinthe Colonial Office, and a Labour Advisory Committee appointedcomposed of persons with expert knowledge of labour and colonial questions ;(e) that Wages Boards should be created in any colonies inwhich they do not already exist. The enactment of satisfactorylegislation providing for the establishment of such boards should be a condition of the participation of any colony in thearrangements proposed below for the assistance of the sugar industry, and the allocation of shares in these benefits to individual concerns should depend on the full execution of thedecisions of the Wages Boards. Differences arising in industriesnot covered by Wages Boards should be handled by the staffof the Labour department allotments or by arbitration panels..&apos; an industrial Court should be established for the West Indies as awhole ;(C;36984)b&apos;2
(/) that West Indian Governments should set an example in labour matteis by forming Whitlcy Councils for civil services,and the principle should be extended to subordinate staff andto teachers ;(g) that the Governments of the larger colonies should examine carefully the possibility of establishing some arrange-ment for unemployment insurance in the case of those under-takings which arc organised on a system of regular employment and with exemptions for those industries where, owing to theintermittent character of employment, a scheme based on thatobtaining in Great Britain would be impracticable ;(A) That adequate factory inspection should be undertakenand factory legislation should be closely co-ordinated with the laws and regulations relating to public health. In the largerterritories a Medical Inspector should be seconded to theLabour Department and everywhere the closest co-operation should be maintained between the medical and social welfareauthorities and that Department ;(i) that West Indian Governments should consider care-fully the possibility of adopting schemes of Workmen&apos;compensation based on the S3&apos;stem in operation in Ontariosince 1915 and subsequently adopted in other CanadianProvinces. This is compulsory and covers manual and non-manual workers in public and private undertakings. Exclusiveadministrative authority is vested in a Board of three membersnominated by Government. The arrangement may be one of collective liability, under which the contributions of all employers, assessed by the Board, are paid into an AccidentFund ; or of individual liability, in which case the employerconcerned may be required to deposit adequate security withthe Board, or to insure his liability. The advantages of thissystem are speed and certainty in operation, the elimination of litigation with its consequences of delay and expense, and theexistence of an authority (the Board) which is well placed toundertake preventive work and propaganda. Whether oneBoard be set up for the West Indies, or Boards for individualColonies or groups of Colonies, is a matter for consideration.In any event, the Labour Officer in each territory could act asagent of the Board concerned in dealing with claims.[j) that the Government of each Colony should be invited totake early steps, in consultation with the sugar producers,with a view to the imposition of welfare levies at the rate oi2s. per ton of sugar produced, to finance welfare schemes similar in their main principles to those organised in Great Britain bythe Miners&apos; Welfare Committee.
(v) Other Social Needs and Services11. Our recommendations are : (a) That each Government should appoint a Social WelfareOfficer and form a Social Welfare Committee of representativesof each Department concerned, however indirectly, in the evolution of a programme of social welfare ; that a social welfare-expert should be a member of the staff of the Comptroller ofthe West Indian Welfare Fund, and that the appropriatemembers of the staff of the Comptroller should form themselvesinto a Social Welfare Committee which would be the centralcounterpart of the local Committees ;(b) That provision should be made for the training of social welfare workers for service in the West Indies. Care must betaken to supplement and support, and not replace, the valuablework now being done by voluntary organisations ;(c) That women should be eligible for appointment to allBoards and local authorities and that, where the representationof women&apos;s interests has not been secured through election,the desirability of nominating a woman or women for membership(if the power exists and if well-qualified persons can be found)should be borne carefully in mind ; that women should be equally eligible with men for appointment as magistrates andfor service as jurors; that the same procedure should befollowed in appointments to the civil service for women as formen ; and that more hostels should be provided for women workers ;(d) That an organised campaign should be undertakenagainst the social, moral and economic evils of promiscuity,the success of which will mainly depend on the extent to whichthe combined authority of the Churches is behind it.(e) That certain improvements should be introduced intothe penal system. These include the increased use of probation,the introduction of modern methods of dealing with young offenders, the abolition of ticket-of-leave, the establishmentthroughout of Prisoners&apos; Aid Societies and Boards of Visitorsand the improvement of conditions for women prisoners.3. Economic Problems12. There is a radical difference between the economic difficulties that face the West Indies to-day, and those that they had to encounterin the nineteenth century. In the case of many if not most tropicalagricultural commodities, the development of new productive areas has been carried so far that there is a prevailing tendency towards a condition of over-supply in world markets and a consequent
tendency towards a depression of prices. Subject to the possibility that the war may cause a partial and temporary improvement inthe prices of some tropical products, these tendencies are likely to prove persistent. Behind them lie influences of a fundamentalcharacter, notably the rapid improvement of agricultural techniquethroughout the world, and the radical change that has taken placein the relation between the growth of population in tropical countries on the one hand, and in the industrial countries that represent their principal markets on the other. The rapid growth of numbers is indeed a factor of profound importance in the various economic and social problems of the West Indies, and it is vitally important thatall sections of West Indian opinion should be fully aware of this fact.13. In order to provide the means of absorbing this growth of population it is essential on the one hand to secure an intensification of the agricultural system through a reorientation in the directionof mixed farming with far greater home production of essential foodstuffs, and on the other to take whatever steps are practicable to improve the position of the agricultural exporting industries.We have examined various proposals made to us for achieving thelatter purpose by increased preferential assistance. It is, however,only in respect of sugar that we are able to make any definiterecommendations at this juncture for increased assistance in thisparticular form.14. The problems of the sugar industty fall under two mainheads (1) the volume of production, (2) the level of prices. Therewas a very large expansion in the production of sugar in the west indies between 1932 and 1937. But this expansion has been checkedby the operation of the International Sugar Agreement which came into force in 1937, and which limits the amount of sugar that can be exported from the Colonial Empire to an assigned quota. In viewof the need of the West Indies for expanding employment outletsand the unfavourable outlook for most branches of export agriculture,this restriction is, or at any rate would have been but for the outbreakof war, a most serious matter for the West Indian Colonies. we regard it, therefore, as of vital importance to secure an increase inthe basic export quota assigned to the Colonial Empire. we recognise on the other hand the force of the objections that can be urged from various standpoints against a large expansion of colonialsugar production.15. After surveying the needs of the various Colonies in the lightof these objections, we had reached the conclusion before theoutbreak of war that the basic export quotas allocated to the west indian Colonies should be increased by about 120,000 tons. Anincrease of this magnitude would be mainly required to avert the under-employment of plant and labour in districts where sugar isalready grown.   This increase is equivalent to about 20 per cent.
of the combined export quotas of these Colonies. In allocating this increased quota among the various West Indian Colonies, regard should be paid, of course, to their varying needs. The claims ofJamaica to an increased quota are, in our judgment, especiallystrong, and we think that Jamaica should be allotted an additionalquota of not less than 50,000 tons. The claims of British Guianarank next in importance, while at the other end of the scale we donot consider that there is any urgent need to increase the quota ofTrinidad. In general, however, we think it best to leave over for subsequent consideration the manner in which the increased quotathat we have suggested should be allocated. If the other sugarColonies were treated on an equal footing, it would be necessary tosecure an increase in the basic export quota of the Colonial Empireof fully 200,000 tons. The war may affect the problem in ways thatit is not easy to foresee ; but in the light of the knowledge at present available, this represents in our judgment a reasonable objective ofpolicy, provided that the increase in sugar production goes hand inhand with an increase of the production of foodstuffs for localconsumption.16. All Empire sugar, Dominion as well as Colonial, receives inthe British market the benefit of a preference of  3 15s. per ton of960 sugar. In addition a supplementary preference is given to Colonialas distinct from Dominion producers upon a limited quantity of&quot; certificated &quot; sugar. We propose certain changes in the arrange-ments regarding this supplementary preference with, a view to improving and stabilising the price received by Colonial producers.These proposals may be summarised as follows : (1) The amount of certificated sugar eligible for the supple-mentary Colonial preference shall be calculated in future foreach Colony in any year so as to represent one-half of the total exports from that Colony in that year.(2) The certificates shall be distributed among the differentfactories in each Colony on the basis of their permitted produc-tion or exports for that year, whichever may be most appropriate.(3) The amount of the supplementary preference payable on&quot; certificated &quot; sugar shall be 3s. per cwt. as at present, butshall be reduced or increased in any year by 4d. per cwt. foreach complete 3d. per cwt. by which the world price of sugar,for the average of the first six months of the year, exceeds orfalls short of 7s. per cwt.17. These proposals have been framed in the light of pre-war conditions, and on the basis of the pre-war purchasing-power of sterling. We leave open the questions how far they can be appliedunder war-time conditions and how far they may need modificationwhen the war is over.   It seems probable that our various proposals(C3H984)b** 2
with regard to sugar would cost the British Exchequer upwards of 1,500,000 a year ; though less than two-thirds of this sum wouldbe attributable to the West Indies.IS. Orderly marketing methods are a condition of the successfuldevelopment of many of the minor agricultural products of theWest Indies. They are important in connection not only withexport trade but also with the development of food production forthe local market. The experiments in orderly marketing now being undertaken in Jamaica deserve encouragement. So far as the exporttrade is concerned, however, it is important that close contactshould be maintained between marketing organisations in theWest Indies and the Colonial Empire Marketing Board, whenreconstituted.19. As regards non-agricultural industries, we do not recommendthat WTest Indian Governments should conduct or finance speculativeindustrial enterprises. There are, however, certain possible projects which Governments might do well to foster : e.g., the establishmentof a cement works in Jamaica, possibly in co-operation with british manufacturers, and the development of the local manufacture ofcoconut products in Jamaica and elsewhere. The system of quanti-tative restriction of imports, coupled with saf eguards for the consumeragainst an undue increase of price, may prove a satisfactory methodof fostering local industries, and schemes based on this methodought not to be disallowed because they run counter to a general principle of British commercial policy, nor should any dislike of this method be permitted to prejudice the fair consideration of such schemes on their merits.4. Agriculture20. Agriculture is the principal source of sustenance and wealthin the West Indies and the standards of life must largely depend onthe intensive use of the soil. The outstanding agricultural need inthe West Indies is more intensive use of the land with increased production of food in order to support a rapidly growing population.The most urgent need is the development of peasant agriculture,but substantial progress among both peasants and estates is dependent upon far-reaching reform of the basic methods now invogue. The practice of shifting cultivation by peasant farmers must be abandoned and replaced by an organised system of permanent mixedfarming ; the present policy of those larger proprietors who growa single crop continuously must be modified by the developmentof mixed farming in a measure which will vary from place to place with local circumstances. Neither of those reforms can be success-fully carried through until new knowledge, which is obtainable only
by scientific investigation, has been secured. War conditions willgive an opportunity, of which advantage should be taken, for making an immediate start with both measures of reform.21. Our recommendations are : (a) Administrative reforms including : (i) the   appointment   of   an   Inspector-General   ofAgriculture for the British West Indies, who should not be a member of the staff of the comptroller of the West Indian Welfare Fund,but should be readily available for consultationregarding any schemes under consideration by the comptroller which have an agricultural bearing ;(ii) the adjustment of the specialist staffs of Agri-cultural Departments in conformit3&apos; with theproposals in (b) below ;(iii) the assumption by the Director of Agriculture inBarbados of responsibility for the Leeward andWindward Islands ; and by the Director ofAgriculture in Jamaica for British Honduras;(iv) provision  for holding  Agricultural  Conferencesevety two or three 3&apos;ears.(b) The centralisation of all major research and investigationat the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, which would thus add to its present functions the 011113&apos; of serving as a researchstation for the West Indies. The money required for this extension of the functions of the Imperial College of TropicalAgriculture should be provided by Parliament, which shouldbe invited to ensure the continuance of the scheme for a definiteterm. The work of Colonial Agricultural Departments shouldbe concentrated on local replications of the central investigationsand on advisory and educational work.(c) The provision at the Hope Agricultural School, Jamaica,of facilities for all the West Indian colonies for agricultural education at the stage immediate^ preceding that of theDiploma courses at the Imperial College which should continueto serve all its present educational purposes.(d) The institution of the following enquiries : (i) A comprehensive soil survey ;(ii) topographical survey to settle questions of landownership ;(iii) surve3&apos; of peasant agriculture, and investigationsfor the purpose of devising better peasant farmingsystems based on mixed farming and the comple-mentary use of livestock and crops ;
(iv) experimental investigation into the introduction ofmixed farming methods into estate cultivation ;(v) a  survey  of,   and  investigation   of  preventivemethods against, soil erosion ;(vi) investigations  on  methods  of  maintaining  soilfertility ;(vii) investigation of the marketing of estate andpeasant produce ; of the possibility of joint action by all the Dependencies in both the marketing and the allocation of production ofcertain products ;(viii) investigations of possible systems of mixed farmingin connection with sugar and other estate crops and study of husbandry practices such as drainage,cultivation and manuring for such crops asbananas, limes, cocoa, etc. ;(ix) surveys of agricultural indebtedness and creditwith a view to bettering the present position.(e) Closer attention should be given to policy in agricultureand that the steps set out in the circular despatch concerningagricultural policy from the Secretary of State for the Coloniesdated 23rd August, 1939, should be adopted.(/) Expert investigation of the arrangements for promotingsoundness and continuity of forest policy in British Guiana,British Honduras and Trinidad, and for assisting the Govern-ments of those Colonies to find local and overseas markets for their forest products.(g) Since from a medical point of view a better-balanceddiet is everywhere necessary, one of the first aims of agriculturalreform must be a great increase in home production of foodstuffswhich are not only adequate in quantity but suitable in quality,and should include milk, fish, eggs and green vegetables.(/z) Certain special measures for special territories as follows: (i) If the campaign against banana diseases in Jamaicacannot be financed locally, further assistance should be afforded by His Majesty&apos;s Government ;(ii) the displacement of share-cropping by land settle-ment in Nevis on the basis of mixed farmingwith sugar as the chief crop ; a sugar quotagradually increasing to at least 3,500 tons perannum ; and the erection by means of assistancefrom Imperial funds of a small sugar factory,failing which special assistance would be required,- e.g. by the provision of transport of uneconomicalrates ;
(iii) both capital works and maintenance of drainage inBritish Guiana should be the charge of a central board ; in order to secure effective co-operationwith the existing Sea Defence Board, the Directorof Public Works and Sea Defences should be chairman of both Boards. The initial cost ofdrainage in British Guiana may have to be treatedas an irrecoverable charge ;(iv) the adoption of the proposal to establish on theEssequibo Coast of British Guiana a central ricemill to be financed by the Government of theColony ;(v) the Trinidad cocoa subsidy should be put on a new basis under which its objective would be the rehabilitation of the industry ;(vi) subject to full consideration of recommendations made as a result of the recent survey of the cocoaindustty in Grenada, assistance should be grantedto it on the lines proposed for Trinidad, but shouldbe paid for by His Majesty&apos;s Government.22. The investigations mentioned above will doubtless show theneed for a scale of expenditure far beyond the resources available tothe Colonial Governments. We recommend, therefore, that asubstantial sum should be allocated by the Imperial Exchequer forthis strictly agricultural work. Expenditure could begin as soonas the first of the surveys recommended has been completed.5. Land Settlement23. This is no more than an orderly plan for settling considerable numbers of people on the land as small-holders and providing themwith certain forms of assistance. It is only one of several ways bywhich the number and yield of peasant holdings may be increased,and is in the West Indies expensive in relation to the number ofpersons settled. Mixed farming and not specialisation on exportcrops must be the basis of land settlement ; this involves a changein outlook and methods, and in the habits and tastes of the consume-ing public and in commercial organisation. At least equal attentionmust be paid to improving the husbandry of existing smallholdersand to providing additional lands for their sons.24. We recommend : (a) that the order of procedure should be, first, the improve-ment of the husbandry of existing smallholders, in the light ofthe results of some of the enquiries recommended in paragraph47(d) above ; then, the improvement of existing land settle-ments and the establishment of new settlements.
(b) that Governments should not regard themselves acommitted to the grant of freehold tenures, but should experiment with both freehold and leasehold tenures. The grant offreehold rights should be subject to appropriate conditions toprevent fragmentation of the land and to suitable safeguardsof good husbandry including the prevention of erosion and themaintenance of soil fertility.(c) that Governments should take powers for the compulsory acquisition of agricultural land needed for land settlement and similar purposes.(d) that it should be firmly impressed on settlers and othersthat, while credit facilities will generally be required in the early stages of any scheme of land settlement, their success depends inthe last resort on their own exertions and that government cannot continue to provide financial support indefinitely.6. Communications25. We recommend : (a) That on a return to normal conditions His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should consider whether they should not offer a subsidy for the maintenance of a regular British passenger service to some of the West Indian Colonies, since british shipping is handicapped by the competition of subsidisedforeign shipping.(b) That two small sea-going ships should be provided atthe cost of His Majesty&apos;s Government for trade between thesmaller islands. Whether such a service should be operated by government or be entrusted to private enterprise in return fora subsidy is a matter for further consideration.(c) A regular air service should be provided from St. Kittsto Trinidad and covering Barbados and all the principal Leewardand Windward Islands.(d) That the Jamaica Government should consider whethera concession in respect of the island telephone service shouldnot be granted to Telephone and General Trust Limited, subjectto the inclusion of satisfactory safeguards, and on acceptance by the Company of an undertaking to assume responsibilityfor the telephone services in the smaller islands under a definiteobligation to expand and improve these services.(e) That a wireless telephone service within the west indies should be provided as soon as possible for the furtherance of economic development and administrative convenience.
(/) That the Empire services of the British broadcasting corporation should be supplemented, particularly as regardseducational broadcasts, by the establishment of a wirelesstransmitter or transmitters in the Caribbean area, the initialcost being met by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the main-tenance costs by the Colonial Governments jointly, in proportion to their average annual revenue. The incidence of the cost of school receivers, etc., would have to be decided after require-ments are known ; where Colonial Governments cannot, fromtheir own resources, provide adequately for these needs, thecost might be defrayed from the Colonial Development Fundor from the West Indian Welfare Fund.7. Constitutional and Closer Union26. We do not support eith2r of the extreme proposals put before us for the grant of immediate and complete self-governmentbased on universal suffrage, or for a wide increase of the authorityof Governors which would convert the existing system into a virtualautocracy ; the one because it would render impossible the financial control necessary if, as we consider to be inevitable, substantial assistance is to be afforded by His Majesty&apos;s Government through theWest Indian Welfare Fund and otherwise ; the other because itwould be politically a retrograde step. More, and not less, participa-tion by the people in the work of government is a real necessity forlasting social advancement. At the present stage, we attach more importance to the truly representative character of legislative councils than to any drastic change in their functions.27. Political federation is not of itself an appropriate means of meeting the pressing needs of the West Indies. Nevertheless, it isthe end to which policy should be directed.2S. We recommend : (a) That care should be taken to ensure that all importantsections and interests of the community ieceive adequate representation in the Executive Councils ;(b) That consideration should be given to the adoption ofa Committee System on an advisory basis to give elected representatives an insight into the practical details ofgovernment ;(c) That official representation in Legislative councils should be confined to the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer andthe Attorney-General, and the resulting vacancies filled bynominations in the spirit recommended in (a) above ;(d) That in order to secure that the elected element in legislative Councils shall be as truly representative as possible,the object of policy should be the introduction of universal
adult suffrage. Some of us hold that this should be introducedforthwith ; otheis that it should be reached by gradual stagesand to this end recommend the appointment of local committees to consider the extension of the franchise, both for local and forcentral government. Such committees should keep in close touch with their countei parts in other West Indian Colonies,and should consider carefully whether, as is strongly desirable,their recommendations would assure substantial equality asbetween the sexes ;(e) That in all West Indian Colonies a careful examination should be made at an early date of the possibility of reducingsubstantially the maigin between the qualifications for registra-tion as a voter and those for membership of the LegislativeCouncil, the latter being in many cases unnecessarily high ;(/) That a practical test of the advantages of federation should be made by combining the Leeward and WindwardIslands in one federation on the lines of that existing in thefoimer gioup ;(g) That means be found for devoting more parliamentary time to the discussion of colonial affairs and, if it is decided topioceed with the establishment of a Standing parliamentary committee to consider colonial affairs, to devise means for theassociation of delegates from the Colonies concerned with thewoik of that Committee.8. Local Unification of Services29. We recommend : That West Indian Governments should be invited to acceptthe principle of local unified services and, if that is generally accepted, should address themselves to the task of givingpractical effect to it at the earliest possible date. It should notbe difficult to make a start by establishing a Unified medical service for the West Indies.9. Administration and Public Opinion30. We recommend : (a) As regards the attitude of public opinion, that Govern-ments should adopt a much more positive policy of bringingtheir point of view before the mass of the people, and of explain-ing in sufficiently simple terms the reasons which lie behind their decisions of major problems ; and that the active assistance
of all persons of standing, and of all available means of publicity,such as broadcasting, should be enlisted in an organised attemptto prevent any further extension of colour prejudice.(b) As regards conditions of service for officers appointedfrom outside the West Indies (i) that West Indian Governments should reconsider theirattitude on the question of the grant of passages tosuch officers both on first appointment and whenproceeding on leave.(ii) that West Indian Governments, particularly those ofthe larger Colonies, should review the salaries of theirsenior officers.In the review of these questions it must be borne in mind that, unless salaries and other conditions of service conformmore closely to the general Colonial level, it must become increasingly difficult to fill the h:gher administrative and professional appointments with men whose training, experience,and ability will fit them (1) to discharge their duties and(2) to co-operate effectively with the Comptroller of the west indian Welfare Fund and his staff in schemes for the socialbetterment of the West Indies.(c) That the Comptroller of the West Indian Welfare fund should be empowered, subject to the consent in each case of theemploying Government, to grant a certain number of scholar-ships each year to serving officers for the purpose of study leave and to meet other costs of that leave where these cannot beborne by local funds.(d) That the Colonial Office should, where possible, avoid the dislocation of public business caused by too frequent changesin the holders of higher appointments.10. Miscellaneous, Local and Sectional Questions31. Individual&apos; Indebtedness : Increase of combined effort, e.g.,by arranging for selected estates to act as central agents for theprocessing and sale of certain products, and the encouragement of voluntary co-operation.32. Census and other Statistics : One of the earliest duties ofthe statistician who we propose should be attached to the staff ofthe Comptroller of the West Indian Welfare Fund should be that ofevolving, in concert with both the local Governments and the ColonialOffice, methods whereby every important return emanating fromthese Colonies, whether rendered to him or to some other authority,
is prepared on a common basis. It should also be recognised thatthe omission of a census, as in several colonies in 1931, is a falseeconomy and deprives Government of knowledge essential for the-atisfactory formulation of policy.33. The Press : In view of the very important and growinginfluence which many organs of the Press in the West Indies nowexercise in the relations between the public and the Civil Service,and on the important questions of colour prejudice and colourdiscrimination, we consider it most important that the value of restraint and moderation should be fully appreciated by those responsible for the conduct and tone of the Press.34. Fisheries : If the cost of a full investigation of the possibilityof development is beyond the rcsouiccs of any Colony, and there ispresumptive evidence that such an enquhy might meet with success,there is a strong claim for assistance from the Colonial development fund or by a direct grant from Imperial Funds.35. Barbados : The claims of this overcrowded colony mustrank high for favourable consideration in connexion with any project for the transfer of populations within the West Indies.36. British Guiana : Outstanding loans-in-aid from the imperial exchequer should be converted into free giants, outstanding obliga-tions on account of the work of the Boundary Commission and of loans from the Colonial Development Fund should be remitted, andin future loans-in-aid should be avoided. Special measures shouldbe taken to protect the Amerindian peoples of the remote hinterland.Some initiative is required of Government to ensure the properorganisation under the Local Government Law of all rural and villagecommunities, wherever situated, and whether or no they have happened to express a desire to be brought within the scope of theLocal Government Board.. 37. British Honduras : (i) Special measures are necessary toensure sanitary living quarters for forest workets, and also steps toregulate the method of payment of wages and to ensure the disappearance of any traces of the truck system.(ii) In addition to the mors general recommendations given above regarding Education, arrangements should be made for thetraining in Jamaica of teachers for British Honduras ; the presentscholarship system should be replaced by one under which scholar-ships would be awarded in strict accordance with merit and without reference to the denominations by which the schools are managed.Any funds released to the denominations by our immediately following recommendation should be expended on the maintenance and improvement of existing schools, Government undertaking the direct provision of new schools.
(iii) British Honduras finances are burdened with debt chargesamounting to about 20 per cent, of the Colony&apos;s revenues. This is roughly equivalent to the annual grant-in-aid from the imperial exchequer. If therefore, responsibility for these debts were assumed by His Majesty&apos;s Government there would be no loss to the imperial exchequer, and British Honduras would be able to balance its ownbudget and be freed from its present unhealthy sense of dependence on external aid. If this is done, there should be substantialalleviations with regard to the Hurricane Loan.(iv) Special steps should be taken to safeguard the interests ofthe aboriginal Mayan and Carib inhabitants.3S. Jamaica : The evolution of a systematic public works programme, to replace the present ill co-ordinated system of reliefworks, and to be correlated with future agricultural and land settlc-ment developments. Consideration should be given to the suggestionthat the Jamaican dependency of the Turks and Caicos Islandsshould be amalgamated with, or at least administered from, the bahamas.39. Leeward Islands : Provision of water supply in Anguilla,drainage in Antigua and roads and drainage in Dominica.40. Windward Islands : Steps should be taken to secure the useof the military buildings in St. Lucia, should such accommodationbecome required as a result of certain of our other recommendations.In St. Vincent improved water supply is very necessary on theLeeward Coast. The better organisation of water supply is also required in Grenada and the Grenadines.41. East Indian Questions : In order to ensure substantialequality in the consideration of the problems of East Indians, werecommend that some officer or officers, preferably members of theLabour Departments, should specialise in East Indian questions and,if suitable candidates are forthcoming, should be East Indians.We also strongly recommend that the possibility of the appointmentof suitable West Indians to posts in the Government service shouldbe carefully borne in mind by Colonial Governments.42. We find ourselves in full sympathy with the complaintsregarding the arrangements for legitimisation and validation of east Indian marriages, and recommend that these marriages should,so far as the law is concerned, be put on exactly the same footing as other marriages. That is to say, the onus of registration shouldbe placed, under penalty, on the priest or other religious functionaryperforming the ceremony ; failure on his part to register the marriageshould not, as at present, result in its invalidation at law. the selection of priests, etc., to act as marriage officers should not present undue difficulty, especially if carried out in conjunction withresponsible representatives of the Indian community.   There was a
further complaint in British Guiana that the local law does not provide for the recognition of divorces according to Moslem usage.This recognition has been accorded in Trinidad and, we were assured,works satisfactorily. We recommend legislation where necessary onthe Trinidad model to meet this grievance. The question does notarise for Hindus, whose religion does not permit divorce.43. Numerous complaints were made to us that Hindus were unable to dispose of their dead in accordance with their religiouscustom, by cremation. Witnesses were unable to point to any enactment limiting their freedom of action in this matter ; and government officials assured us that there was no intention to prohibit cremations, subject to certain reasonable sanitary and other conditions. It seems to us that these complaints are largely basedon misunderstanding, and we recommend that Governments take steps to make the legal position plain and to ensure that, subject tonecessary safeguards, no obstacle should be placed in the way of thepractice.(C36984)   125   2/-I0
