Allotted to Reforms Department. 66.Copies Circulated (1070 groups)DSCYPHER   OF   OFFICIALTELEGRAM.From Viceroy to Secretary of State for Indian-Dated New Delhi, 12.35 hours, 30thJanuary, 1940 aReceived       08,45 hours, 30th January, 1940eIt, [MEDIATE.140-S .,   I have now heen ahle to thinlc over your most valuable personal telegram of   26th January, ho,431, and you willhave had my telegram dated 26th January, No. 127-S.      It was ofcourse prepared before receipt of your 431.     But I think that infact it disposes of the bulk of the points which you raise and   ..*that I can confine myself in this reply to certain specificissues on which you touch.2..     Your paragraph No.2. (? I am) considering line (s) you suggest about (? scheduled) castes, and will probably telegraphseparately to you about this.I revert below to general question of extent to v/hichprogress must be conditional on agreement here.3..     Your paragraph No.3.   You will have gathered from my127-S that I fully agree with you as to difficulties of making any real progress on a limited basis, and that in fact Icontemplate going a good deal further, on the lines indicatedin that telegram.     You will have seen also that I equallyaccept that one has to be prepared for discussion with Gandhi,and probably also with Moslems and Princes, about implications of, and approach (? to) Dominion Status.4,     Your paragraph No.4(a).    I wholly agree that Dominion Status

must &quot;be for a Federated India.(&quot;b)    Your (3) is nearest to marl:.     As you will havegathered from my 127-S, my aim would he, by satisfying Congress nowas to His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention for status of India andfor achievement as early as possible after consultation with india of   Dominion   Status,  to go ahead at once (if we could secure acceptance by Moslem minorities and   States of that position and of federation)    (I) with expansion of my Council:    (il) with FederalSection of   Act (possibly with minor alterations) at first possible moment thereafter:    as (sic) (ill) a preliminary to consultations(as I see it after the war) with (? British India) and Indian Statesover technical points involved in achievement of   Dominion Statusmoye particularly defence, which could result in proposals to HisMajesty&apos;s Government, backed by Indian opinion, to cover all thosepoints, and in due course to be embodied in a treaty or agreementbetween new   Dominion   Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government.Let me only add on this that I have &quot;alv/ays felt at thesame time that we ought to go very slow.     We have already beenable to give 6 months of full support in men and material during thewar without in any way prejudicing chances of peace in India, and since none of us can tell what the post war position may be inrelation either to Great Britain or India, or world, or whateconomic or military environment of   India may then be, it would ba pity to commit ourselves in detail to anything more of an ultimateand permanent kind than is essential in order to avoid reallyserious difficulty now.      Moreover we must, as I see it,  continue tcbear in mind that even though we may reach a settlement (? now),(? we are) pretty certain to have trouble with Left later on, andthat we cannot exclude the possibility as time goes on of a quite .substantial movement of Indian opinion away from   Right    (with whichwe shall have made our bargain and upon which we must depend for

*u 9 9delivering the goods) and. towards the Left.It might well he hotter in those eircr: ^stances to faceserious trouble now rather than to try to escape it by taking asettle: vent bad from our point of view.    But I think (? such a )scheme which I have put to you,  if wo could achieve it, would afford the host hope of avoiding immediate trouble, and of securing forIndia after the &quot;ar the constitutional status to which we arccommitted, consistently with avoiding running of major risks.    (? Ifyou)    went my view of what wo skorld aim at, as stated above,  andin ray telegram 127-S,   (? amplified, or) clarified in any respect,will you lot me know, an&quot;. I will telegraph at once?5. I wholly accept objections which you indicate in paragraphho.5 of your telegram to line indicated in your ouostion (2).    take note of your (? estimate)    of possible post war position.    Ishould have (? thought) myself that it was too pessimistic.    but you are in a bettor position to judge than I am.At any rate, the scheme which I put before you in my 127-S,if we wore fortunate enough to be able to get Congress, Moslems andthe Prances into line, and to progress on this basis, would makeabundantly clear to the world that such obstacles as existed toachievement of full self-government here were not owr fault.5. The other main point emerging out of your telegram which,calls, I thin::, for comment from me is reference in paragraphs No.2 and o to essential, necessity of prior agreement between all con-cerned,    How, as you will have gathered from my 127&apos;-S, I of coursefully (? share) your view that some working agreement between thetwo major communities in British India and also between british india and the States is essential if this country is to be ableto hold together. It is no good our blinking that fact, andno good Congress blinking it either. V/ere we to

abdicate in f favour-of^X&apos;cngjre.SA. tb^t &quot;&quot;hc^-would not for a mount &quot;be able to hold the country against an oppositioncontaining the Moslems and the States,Indeed what I have throughout felt as ore of the main difficulties in considering constitutional progress here isfinding of shenlders bread enough to carry the burden whichwe shall relinquisho    Congress by itself,  I am perfectly certain,could never (? carry)  it,  and only hope is a system which has got a reasonable (? measure of) agreement and support fromall parties and (? interests).7o       I am anxious on the other hand to avoid stating in terms that absence of agreement between important sections here willbe regarded as decisive objection (? to any) form   of constitutional advance.    Congress would certainly representacceptance of that position (? as an) encouragement by us toMinorities and States to bloc: any progress.    The Moslems andPrinces would jump at chance of maintaining status quo    or of driving an unreasonable bargain as price of its modification,What I have had in mind therefore has been,  as suggestedin paragraph No,8 of my 127-S,  to try to bring home to congress the necessity for some accommodation with other major interestsin this country in the interests of future of India, and to try to persuade the Moslems slightly to abate their claims in theinterests of such accommodation,  and the States equally to taxea reasonable line.      I do not underestimate the probabledifficulty., but I thinx this is the most hopeful approach.While, too, I accept the importance of the proposition inthe last sentence of your paragraph No06, I think that here,too, the wise course will be for me to hint at that propositionrather than to state explicitly.      A public statement in these terms might well unduly strengthen Congress by enabling itto hold up Moslems and States as sole obstacle to Indianfreedoms

There are already suggestions in Press that asJinnah&apos;s attitude is unreasonable, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould ignore hi. i and negotiate, with Congress only;    and as. &quot;ou know Gandhi&apos;s object has all along b^en to secure our acceptance of Congress and himself as only people with whomto negotiate, cod to -oersunde   s to make it clear to other parties in thio. country that   nil..   .c oould r^c juotic. doo,..to then, th.-y could look for cooc-ooions only from Congress.8. In general I regard this coming talk or talks with gandhi (? which) as you know, I have agrood to start 5thFebruary, as purely preliminary.      You and I ought,  I think,In the- light of my telegram 127-6 and my present   telegram,to he able to clear ground sufficiently by   then.      If Icome up against unexpected on.gs,  I shall, of course, haveto ask Gandhi for time.      In any case before we can makereal progress we shall have to rot in Moslems and states which may again take (? omission)-The first thing is clearly to find out how Gandhi&apos;s rnind is working.9..       I am giving no distribution to this telegram.
