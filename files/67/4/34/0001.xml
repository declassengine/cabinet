WAR CABINET.

B.B.C. NEWS BULLETINS

Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.

At their meeting on 22nd January, (W.M.(40) 20th Conclusions, Minute 5), the War Cabinet invited me to represent to the Minister of Information the views of the War Cabinet in regard to prefacing the B.B.C Daily News Bulletins by short summaries of the main items.

I now circulate the following extract from a letter which I have received from the Minister of Information on the subject:

"These &apos;indexes&apos;  came into regular use early in September owing to criticisms that bulletins repeated themselves. It lets people know at once if there are any new items and avoids them having to listen to those already heard. The index seems to serve a useful purpose and to be generally welcome.

But the objections mentioned are real and the Ministry has examined the matter with the B.B.C.

Unless the sinkings (of warships or merchant-men) are of importance the Corporation now refrain from mentioning them in the index and in more than one bulletin. But when a sinking is important, it is difficult to omit reference to it in the index; the omission would probably be as obvious as the mention when other items of less interests were given.

"The B.B.C. have, however, agreed to running these two mentions into one by placing the brief reference at the end of the index and the detailed account at the beginning of the bulletin.     And I should add that while the matter was under discussion they made no reference to &apos;Exmouth&apos; in the index". Treasury Chambers,

S.W.1., 30th January, 1940. (Initialled) S.H.
