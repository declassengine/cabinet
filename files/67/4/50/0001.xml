JtDRAFT DESPATCH TO PUS MAJESTY&apos;3 AMBASSADOR IN PARIS.foreign Office,February, 19hO.IMMEDIATE.Sir,In my despatch No.  2235    of the 7th September last Iforwarded to Y0ur Excellency a copy of a letter to theSecretary General of the League of Nations in which HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom gave notice thatthey would not regard their acceptance of the Optional clause of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justiceas covering disputes arising out of events occurring duringthe present hostilities.      As reported in Sir E. Phipps&apos;despatch No. 1250    (M6S/33/39) of the lhth September last, theFrench Government took corresponding action.2.    When H.M. Government accepted the Optional Clause in 1930they did so for a period of ten years and thereafter until such time as they gave notice of termination.      This initialten year period expired on the 5th February,  and H.M.Government have therefore had under consideration the questionof their future policy with regard to the Optional Clause.There are in the circumstances three possible courses nowopen to H.M. Government:(l)    To take no further action and thereby to prolongtheir initial acceptance of the Optional Claiise.    In this case it will be necessary to continue to rely on the notification of the 7th September last to ensure that disputes arising out of our belligerent action are not made the subject of proceedings before the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice.x   Attached as Appendix,x   Not reproduced.-1-

(2)    To terminate thoir acceptance of the optional clause, and possibly to accompany this action with a statc-mont that they would be prepared to consider the matter further at the end of the war.(3)    To terminate their aco-eptance of the optional clause and simultaneously to deposit with the Secretary-General of the League cf Nations a new acceptance, which  /ould repeat the reservations which H.M. Government made whenoriginally accepting the Clause in 1930 and would add to thema reservation covering dispoites arising out of eventsoccurring at a time when H.M. Government were engaged in hostilities.3. After duly considering the question H.M. Government see no advantage in adopting the first of these courses.    If theywere automatically to prolong their acceptance of the optional Clause with the present reservations, and an attempt was subsequently made to take them to the Permanent Courtover a war time dispute, they would have to rely entirely onthe validity of the action taken last September and it wouldbe for the Court to decide whether or not that action wasvalid.      By adopting either of the other two courses H.M.Government would on the other hand place, themselves in aposition v/hich in this respect would be legally unassailable.In this connexion it is material to note that seven governments have already formally reserved their position as regards theaction taken by H.M. Government in September last, and thatthe countries in question (Switzerland, Belgium, TheNetherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Peru and Estonia) arewith two possible exceptions among those with whom a disputearising out of our belligerent action is most likely to arise.    Since it is in the opinion of H.M. Government of the

greatest importance to avoid the danger of such a dispute beingtaken before the Permanent Court, they are strongly of theopinion that the first course should not be adopted,h.    The only argument in favour of this course relates to theposition of the French Government, who are bound by the optional Clause until April 19hl and who would up to that date,if an attempt were made to take them to the Permanent Courtover a war time dispute, have to rely on the    reservationwhich they communicated to the Secretary General of the Leagueof Nations at the same time as H.M.  Government last September.The French case for denying the jurisdiction of the court would not of course-be juridically weakened by the circumstancethat H.M. Government, by adopting either the second or thethird course suggested, are able to provide themselves with asecond lino of defence, and in doing so H.M. Government willbe careful themselves to cast no doubts on the effectiveness of the reservation already communicated in the name of both governments to the League, but  on the contrary will continueto insist upon its sufficiency.      In any event, while I trust that the French Government will feel no misgivings from thispoint of view, I am not disposed to attach too much importanceto this consideration.    I foci that H.M. Government arc more likely than the French Government to be involved in a disputeof this character,  in view of the special role which they arcnecessarily called upon to play in measures of economic warfare,and if H.M. Government, having adopted the first course, failedto persuade the permanent Court that their notification ofSeptember last was valid, the consequences would be as seriousfor the French Government as for H.M. Government.

A 0 ^4 .&apos;o5.    The adoption of cither the second or the third coursesuggested would produce the same result of safeguarding thelegal position of H.L&quot;. Government,  and. the choice between thornis therefore largely a matter of policy.      Your Excellencywill recall that when the Committee of Imperial Defence con-sidcrod the report of the sub-committee on the Optional Clause-.and the General Act (my despatch No- 288h\&quot; of 22nd December,1938) they decided not to denounce the latter instrument but rather to make a reservation of war time disputes.      The FrenchGovernment took similar action.      The political considerations which led to the adoption of this course at that time appear tobe equally applicable now.    It has already been necessary to correct misconceptions to the effect that the action which H.M. Government took last September involved a repudiationof all their obligations under the Optional Clause,  and itwould indeed be illogical for H.M. Government to withdrawentirely from the Optional Clause while they are still bound bythe General Act, which, in the case of countries which areparties to both instruments, produces the same effect.6.    In view of these considerations, H.M. Government are ofthe opinion that they should terminate their acceptance of the optional Clause as soon as possible and should simultaneouslydeposit a fresh acceptance, which would repeat the reservationswhich were made in 1930 and add to them a reservation of disputes arising at a time when H.M. Government arc engaged in hostilities.    The wording of this reservation would follow as closely as possible that made last year in relation to theGeneral Act.    It is further considered necessary that the newacceptance should run for a fixed period, since an acceptanceliable to be terminated at any time would inevitably lead to criticism.    In existing circumstances such a period should beh   Not reproduced.

neither too short nor too long,  and H.M. Government therefore consider that acceptance for ?. period of five years and thereafteruntil denunciation would he suitable.     In this event it would benecessary that the new reservation should not bo confined, as wasH.M. Governments notification of September last, to disputes arising during the present war, hut should, cover disputes arisingout of events occurring at any time during the period of acceptance when H.Government might be engaged in hostilities.7.    In view of the close interest of the French Government inthis question H.M; Government are anxious to take no actionexcept after consoxltation between the two Governments.    I shall therefore be glad if Your Excellency will take an early opportunityof laying before the French Government the considerations outlined in the preceding paragraphs and of enquiring whether they agree tothe course of action proposed., which is,  in the opinion of H.M.Government, best calculated to serve both French and Britishinterests.    If H.H. Government&apos;s proposal is adopted, it 1sd.desirable that the necessary communication to the League ofNations should be made as soon as possible,  since any dela3^ will increase the possibility of proceedings being commenced againstH.M. Government in the P.C.I.-J. before they have completelysafeguarded their position.    You should therefore request theFrench Government for an early expression of their views.

Ho. 2235.FOREIGN OFFICE, 3.&apos;/. 1.(V.12888/107/98).17th September, 1939.Sir,With reference to my despatch Jo. 2182 of the 1stSeptember, I transmit to Your Excellency herewith a copy ofthe letter which I have addressed to the Secretary-General ofthe League of Nations regarding&apos;His Majesty&apos;s governments acceptance of the Optional Clause of the Staoute of thePermanent Court of International Justice *2..     I would draw your attention to certain minor changes(underlined in the enclosed copies) which have been made in this letter as compared with the draft transmitted in my despatchunder reference, in particular to that made in the thirdsentence of paragraph 4.     The reason for this is that HisMajesty&apos;s Government wished to reserve (in case it may become necessary to rely upou them in discussions v/ith neutral states)any rights they possessed as a Member of the League, and Ishall be glad if, in transmitting to the French Government acopy of the enclosed letter, you will inform the FrenchGovernment accordingly,  so that they may, if they think fit,take similar action.3.      I understand that the French Government yesterdaysignified to you their intention of taking similar action tothat of His Majesty&apos;s Government after a delay of forty-eight hours, and in a rather briefer form.     With this His Majesty&apos;sHis excellency the Right HonourableSir Eric Phipps, G. Q.M.-G, G.C.V.GetcetcetcParis--1-

Government would &quot;be in full concurrence, provided thatessentially the same arguments are put forward to theSecretary-General of the League.I am,etc.(Signed) A.V/.G. RANDALL.(for the Secretary of State.)
