I,  IJlTROJDyCTOP Y,1.       At the instance of the Treasury we have had under consideration the necessity of extending thepresent partial system of import control to coverall imports,   Vie have, further, considered the needfor restricting home consumption,,    We have come tothe conclusion in the light&apos;of our review of thesituation,  that one of those :,&apos;gaps&quot; in our economicwar effort is disclosed in respect of which we arerequired by our terms of reference to make proposals to the Minister or Ministers concerned, and we make recommendations accordingly (see paragraph 16 below.)2o        Though these questions were raised by theTreasury on grounds of foreign exchange, the needfor action is supported by considerations drawn fromthe experience of other Departments.,II. COHTROI, OP IMPORTS.3.       A control of imports is, of course,  anessential feature of every system of Exchange Control.In the case of Germany and many other countrieshaving Exchange Controls there is a double check;a trader who desires to import goods must obtain an authority from the banking authorities of thecountry in respect of the foreign exchange he requires,and further he must obtain authority from theappropriate Government Department or Control to import the goods in question.,    Our own system isvery much simpler since in fact there is nothing toprevent a person who is otherwise authorised to buyforeign goods from ob training, simply through his ownbanker, any foreign exchange he requires.    It followshowever that since we rely exclusively on control ofimports that part of the system must be made reasonablywatertightQ4.       The annexed Table shows the present positionas regards control of our imports..    It will be seenthat all the more important foods are subject to schemes of centralized purchase,  that there is avarying degree of control by the Ministry of Supplyover the imports and ,consumption of raw materials,that important categories of commodities are coveredeither by import licensing (luxury foods and manufactured go^os) or by special arrangement(petroleum) &quot;Lug th?t -i flue of miscellaneous        1articles, of which certain foods are the mostimportant, are subject to no control at all, either as regards importation or as regards consumption,,5*       There is a further point, not brought out inthe Table namely that as regards the commodities in class I (essential foodstuffs and raw materials) thereis nothing whatever in our present arrangements toprevent importation consignment, because there isnot necessarily any prohibition of import intothe United Kingdom.    That is to say that even when

14 his Majesty&apos;s Government is the sole importer, and na.import hy other persons in the United Kingdom is allowed, the exporter abroad can send these goods hereat will.     They may he requisitioned on arrival, andforeign exchange may he refused to pay for them, hut ifrequisitioned they will he paid for in sterling,    andthe sterling can he turned into dollars or any otherfree currency on the New York or other Foreign markets,or can he got out hy purchase and export of goods.6. In the early stages of the war this gap inour system of import control did not lead to serious consequences for prices rose abroad in the expectation of a shortage of commodities.      Owing to the depreciation of sterling and the control of prices in this country,the despatch of goods to this country was not speciallyattractive to the foreign exporter.     The situation isnoW changing and the importation of certain types ofgoods on consignment to this country is in many instances profitable to the foreign exporter.     Whencontrolled foodstuffs are imported in this manner theycannot indeed be sold freely in the market hut arerequisitioned hy the Ministry of Foodo     However theMinistry may be compelled to pay higher prices thanthose they had already arranged with their own suppliersabroad for consignments which they do not desire.7.-        The Controls which have been instituted bythe Ministry of Supply do not in all cases extend toa control of importation.     The primary purpose of most of the Controls was to meet difficulties likelyto arise from a shortage of raw materialsi   provision has been made to see that the materials available were used for the most important purposes and that maximum prices were imposed.     A control of importation hasin general been imposed only when the purchasingprogramme of the Control made it necessary to prohibitcompetition.     With consumption of raw materials atthe   rate which has existed since the outbreak of war,it is doubtful If there is any possibility of theimportation of any important raw materials being inexcess of consumption, and a large proportion of thearticles made from most imported raw materials isrequired by the Services or by the export trade.     Itmust be recognised that a substantial diminution of theimport of raw materials will therefore mean a largereduction in the supply of goods for the civilpopulation, and a substantial increase in their price.8. Reference to the annexed table shows that thelargest group of uncontrolled imports consists of foodstuffs which the Ministry of Food has not brought under control on the grounds that they are not essential.     We think that in any case this distinctionbetween essential and non-essential foodstuffs wouldrequire revision;   we do not, for example, see whyrice should be regarded as non-essential.     The effectof rationing essential foodstuffs at controlledprices is to increase the demand for foods of a less essential character.

In our opinion the control of importation (that is to say,prohibition of import except under licence) should heextended to these less essential foodstuffs.     No onedesires control for itself and new measures of control invitecriticism and make considerable demands on the departments responsible for administering theme     While we very fullyrealise these points,  the arguments for extending controlof import in this case are, in our opinion, overwhelming.9. It is in the first place absurd that we should gowithout -munition and raw materials for military purposes orsupplies of essential goods for civilian purposes because ourlimited   csources of exchange and shipping space are taken up by nc-i-essentinl goods.      In the second place, even whereit is desirable or necessary to import certain quantities ofgoods of this character the control of the source frcm whichthey come should be in the hands of the Government, since itmay involve problems of exchange and problems of shipping.It is one thing to import from the Mediterranean and quiteanother thing t   import from California,-     Yet in the caseof mrrsy fruits, for examoJLe, as matters stand the Governmentis powerless to arrange from what source such supplies shallbe obtained.10.       A further very important consideration is the effect,in forcing up the level of freights, of the attempts ofshippers not only of unessential commodities but also of essential commodities the quantity of which is not in any wayconcr Lied, to secure shipping space.     Where the profit onimportation is consiceraDle it is inevitable that would-beforeign exporters should compete strongly for availabletonnage, and especially neutral tonnage, for the transport ofsuch goods to this country.     This has happened conspicuouslyinthe last few weeks in the case of cotton sent from theUnited htates, and this kind of competition has been partly responsible for the high level now reached in the neutralfreight market,.     As a result when the Ministry of Shippingattempts to charter neutral ships for the import of essential goods purchased on behalf of the Ministry of^Food and theMinistry of Supply the commercial rates on the unessential oruncontrolled goods are quoted as having determined the marketrate on which chartering should be arranged,11.       A final and very important consideration is that where shipping facilities from abroad are limited, pricesabroad, which tend to be governed by the British import demand,are low, so that large profits are obtainable by those shipperswho have secured shipping space, and these may be foreigners.It would be in every way preferable if these imports are to be permitted at all, that the profit on importation should accrue to the Ministry of Pood and should be used to offset the continuing rlee in the cost of the staple foodstuffs whichenter into the cost of livings     One method of operation wouldbe for the Ministry of Food to become the sole importers of theunessential foodstuffs in question, using for this purpose the existing trade organisations but selling these gods,on arrival in this country, at the most favourable priceobtainable, leaving the distribution to the ordinary tradechannels,,     There may however be other methous which might,prove more appropriate in certain cases.

12. Once n decision on policy has been taken, effect should bu civen to it gradually by bringing&apos;first the moreimportant of these commodities under control.      close co-operation between the Government Departments concerned will be necessary since in sorau cases, e.g. goods fromthe sterling part of the Empire, only shipping considerationsneed be attended to, while in other cases exchangeconsiderations enter also.      In other cases it may be thatimport of unessential commodities is accompanied by aspecial gain of exports which makes it worth while,particularly if the countries sending . goods here willsupply the shipping.      There may also bo reasons of general war policy which make it expedient to continue to importcertain commodities, which on other grounds would be Judgedunnecessary.III.      RESTRICTIOff Off HOMM CONSUMPTION.13. In addition to restriction of imports action isnecessary as regards the restriction   of internal consumption.The over-riding principle in war time for a country whichcannot replenish its wasting foreign exchange resources by borrowing in the United States must be to cut down the foreign exchange requirements of the civil population in order that,even if the war drags on a long time, the essential requirementsboth of food and of munitions, aeroplanes, etc. may still bemet.      But if    internal demand keeps up while imports arereduced, internal prices of the goods in short supply mustrise, perhaps steeply.      This would be likely to lead to ademand for increased imports, or, if this was refused, toa movement to supply the home market, where attractive   profitscould be obtained, with goods which would otherwise    havebeen exported.      Thus there is a serious danger that if nostups were taken to safeguard the position the reduction ofimports of raw materials v/ould lead more directly to reductionof exports than to reduction of internal consumption.14.        In order to prevent this happening it will bo necessaryin cases where rationing cannot be imposed, to insist that asatisfactory proportion of the raw materials imported shouldbe allotted, through the priority machinery,  to the exporttrade, and so far as may be practicable to ensure    that these materials are in fact used for the purpose to which they wereallotted.      We do not propose to enter here into the questionof the technical machinery involved;    but it must be recognisedthat in many cases it will be difficult to secure the desiredend.15-.        It cannot be too strongly hoped that the whole practicalvalue of action on the foregoing lines and the whole possiblityof a successful outcome depend upon the public attitude of mindwhich at the moment is certainly not prepared.      It is essentialtherefore by forceful and accurately timed publicity to bring home to the public that the magnitude of the effort required by the warwith the accompanying strain which it imposes on our financial and shipping resources, is such as to demand a general acceptance ofsacrifices through a rigorous reduction in the consumption ofgoods of all kinds and a recognition of the inexorable need forthe utmost economy in private expenditure.IV.

The&apos;Committee had bef ore&quot;them&quot;a&apos;Report^ty&apos; the Inter-departmental Committee on Economic Policy on the Controlof Imports and Consumption.   (Paper No. E.P.(M.)(40) 3).THE CHAIRMAN said that the report before them raisedtwo important questions, first whether our present system for controlling imports v/as adequate, having regard to the key position of this control in our scheme of exchange control;    and, secondly, whether the present restrictions on domestic consumption went far enough.      The need forsaving foreign exchange and shipping was urgent, and it wason this ground that the recommendations of the Report were based.The Report pointed out that the German system of con-trol involved a double check, in that it required importersfirst to secure permission to import, and secondly toobtain from the banking authorities permission to makepayment in foreign exchange.      In this country, however,it was said that we relied entirely on the control ofimports.      It was certainly undesirable to increase unneces-sarily the formalities with which traders had to comply;but was it accurate to say that at present the banksexercised no control over the issue of permits for payments of foreign exchange for imports?SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that in the case of applica-tions for exchange for imports the banks confined them-selves to establishing that the authorisation appropriate to any particular class of imports had been received.If no authorisation were required under the orders atpresent   in force exchange was granted freely.     the relevant Defence Regulation laid down that exchange shouldbe granted for legitimate purposes of trade.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE asked whether the need tosecure shipping space, which required the consent of the

Minister of Shipping, did not constitute a second check onimportation.,SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that it was open to importersto secure shipping space in neutral boats which were notchartered by the Ministry of Shipping.      The Report pointedout that this competition for neutral shipping was one ofthe reasons why freight rates had risen so sharply againstthe Ministry of Shipping, who were anxious to secure neutral tonnage for their own purposes.THE MINISTER OP POOD said that his Department had been set up to secure the supply and distribution of essentialfoods needed by our population.      The Report now invoked theiraid to control for financial purposes the imports of ...&quot; -unessential foods;    and he was willing to co-operate for thispurpose.      It must be remembered, however, that a considerableextension of administrative machinery would be required.    Itwas suggested that the Ministry should make profits onthese unessential foods;   but, if the administrative machinery was too costly the game would not be worth the candle.     Forthis reason he felt that the control of unessential foodsshould be considered commodity by commodity, and onlyaccepted where a profit could in fact be secured.      He hadalready agreed to extend control to fresh and preservedfruits and vegetables.THE MINISTER OF SHIPPING said that the recommendationsof the Report, if adopted, would lead to a reduction in thedemands for tonnage, which was very much needed. For that reason he supported them.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that in his view it would benecessary to establish a comprehensive control of imports for shipping reasons.      In the absence of control, essential goodsmight be prevented from being imported by the competition of unessential goods.     He contemplated, therefore, thatthe Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Supply should

between them exercise a com.p7i.ett; control over our import programme. *   Moreover.;  the examination v/hich he had been making or? the shipping position hac led him to the conclusionthat the present programme of imports contemplated by theDepartments v/as probably optimistic, and ifiat it might be. necessary to out it down at short notice.      In that event,the question of what imports were to ho curtailed would haveto be referred to the Priorities Committc-.ec-     It was essentialhowever, that there should bo in existence administrative machinery v/hich could give prompt effect to th- decisionsthen agreed on.      They would need to assure themselves thatthey had built up an organisation which would take thisstrain.SIR WILLIAM BROW said that the Import LicensingCommittee had the question of uncontrolled imports? constantlyunder review.      It met at least once a week.-      Ac present the major items had been dealt with,  and those which remained,though numerous, were small individually.      Once it v/asdecided to restrict the import of any commodity to a givenfigure, it was then necessary to distribute the permittedimports, first between the supplying countries, and thenbetween individual importers3     This involved a considerableamount i;;: work;  and it wou] d lead to disorganisation if theDepartment were asked to deal with too many commodities atthe same time.In reply to the Minister of Pood, SIR WILLIAMBROW said that there was no generally accepted docxrine asto the application of the &quot;Most Favoured Nation Clause&quot; in commercial treaties to control of imports by licence,.     Wewere now insisting on the interpretation, which in peace wehad resisted,  that the clause could not be invoked in thecase of quantitative restrictions.      There had been complaintsin neutral countries that we had been favouring France undulyand these complaints should be borne . in mind when the

application of&quot; a licensing system to fruits and vegetableswas under consideration.THE CHAIRMAN said that he had recently given an under-taking to Mo Reynaud on the subject of restrictions on french products entering this country3 and we had receivedcertain concessions in return,      It was essential that thenew controls now in contemplation should not be so adminis-tered as to reopen this question,,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that it would be helpful to the Committee if they could have before them an account of the import licensing system prepared by the Boardof Trade.THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADEdeferred to the passage in the report that indicated that special profits were being earned on the import of certainunessential commccli ties.,      This consideration still appliedwhen commodities were imported only under licence.      Thisprofit should also accrue to the State.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said that he would beloath to increase  the number of controllers,-      In so faras commodities which involved substantial shipping considera-tions were concerned^ controllers had already been appointed.He would prefer the control of imports not subject tocontrollers to be exercised by the banks.THE CHAIRMAN said that he sympathised with thedesire of the Minister of Supply not to increase the numberof controllers.      The Treasury were not wedded to any parti-cular form of control;   but the objection to control by the banks was that a bank could only consider each transactionby itself., and was not in a position to relate our total

imports of any co Jiodity to our national requirementseTHE MINISTER 01&apos;&apos; FOOD said that in the case of anumber of foods, import into this country was undertaken onthe initiative of the foreign supplier&apos;.,      This represented a gap in our system of exchange control,SIR RICHARD HOPKINS explained that goods sent tothis country on consignment by foreigners could be requisi-tioned on arrival here by the Ministry of Pood, but were paid for in sterlingo      This sterling could be withdrawneither through the unofficial exchange market in New York,or in some cases at the official rate,-      If, however, goods of a class subject to import licence regulations wereimported into this country; clearance was refused by thecustovns, and if landed here, they were seised.      It was forthis reason that the report suggested that the import ofgoods subject to control by the Ministry of Pood and theMinistry of Supply should only be permitted under licence.This would prevent import on consignment to which theMinister of Pood had referred.THE CHAIRMAN said that it was clear from thediscussion that any extension of *he control of imports mustbe undertaken gradually,,     The Committee would, however, wishto be kept in touch with what was being dor.o0    He suggested,therefore, that the Board of Trade should be asked to prepare a review in four to six weeks and monthly thereafter, showing what had been done to give effect to an3^ conclusions to whichthe Committee might    come,,&apos;l&apos;he Committee then considered the recommendations contained in paragraph 16 of the report before them.On recommendation (c)r-THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY said that he hoped that theMinistry of Supply would not be asked to increase the numberof controllers to   oversee the import of a number of

commodities.      His own view was that the survey suggested bythe report would not lead to the discovery of any commoditywithin the sphere of his Department to which control could usefully be extended.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that itwould   not be necessary to specify the form of control which might be used in the case of commodities to the controlof which this review might point.On recommentation (e):-THE MINISTER OP POOD recalled that the Committeehad already agreed that so far as practicable use should bemade of existing trade organisations for the import of commodities.     It would not be consistent with this conclusion for the Ministry of Pood to attempt to make profitsby putting the importers of un-sssential goods out of business.THE CHAIRMAN said that that was not the suggestion.It was contemplated that use would be ma de of existingimporters at an appropriate fee to bring the goods into thiscountry as agents for the Ministry of Food.-      The profitsreferred to would arise by the sale of these luxury goods,in which the Ministry of Pood would have the position of amonopolist, at high prices to the public0THE MINISTER OP POOD said that he was prepared toprofiteer in these luxury goods for the benefit of theTreasury.On conclusion (f):-THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE MINISTRY OP SUPPLYsaid that in fact the Ministry of Supply through theCentral Priority Department were already allocatingmaterials to the export trade in the case of those materials which had been reviewed by the appropriate Committee.     Thedifficulty was to get the appropriate Department to raise

with the Committee the question of the allocation of rawmaterials.
