REPORT ON THE POSSIBILITY OP STABILISING THE PRICESOP STAPLE COMMODITIES AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT&apos; policy IN RELATION TO WAGES AND PRICES.I.    INTRODUCTORY.At our meeting held on Monday,  22nd January, 1940(E.P.(M.)(40) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 3) we had under consideration whether, as part of our general policy for dealing with prices and wages, the Government should take steps to stabilise atleast for the next few months the prices of staple commodities.It is very desirable that a decision on this question should bereached as speedily as possible, since the discussions withorganised Labour on the policy to be adopted in regard towages increases are not going well, and if the discussions were continued on their present basis a deadlock might easily bereached at the next meeting of the National Joint Advisory council which will take place on 31st January.     We accordingly submit for the consideration of the War Cabinet the present Reportin which, after describing tha action which has already beentaken to stabilise the prices of staple commoditios, weanalyse the extent to which it would be possible to carry theprocess of stabilisation at the expense of the Exchequer.Finally we submit for the consideration of the war Cabinetour recommendations as to the action which the Government shouldtake in these matters at the present time.II.    THE EXTENT TO WHICH ACTION HAS BEENTAKEN SINCE NOVEMBER 1939 TO stabilise the PRICES OP STAPLE COMMODITIES ANDTHE&quot; EXPENDITURE SO INVOLVED.&quot;(a) The measures taken to stabiliseprices of staple commodities.2. The War Cabinet will recall that at the end ofNovember last, arrangements were made for the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer early the following month to open discussions on the subject of wages and prices with the National Joint

Advisory Council consisting of leading representatives ofemployers and labour which had then recently been establishedby the Ministry of Labour.     Though the subject was admittedlyvery difficult and success v/as doubtful, hopes were entertainedthat some considerable progress might be made through these discussions, but these hopes were naturally influenced to alarge extent by the question whether, during the progress of thediscussions, the cost of living remained reasonably constant orwhether it continued to shoot sharply upwards and thus sow freshanxiety in the minds of Labour as to the distance to which themovement might go.      It was at this precise moment that theMinistry of Pood reported that for unavoidable causes theprices of several staple foods would need to be raised.3. It was accordingly decided as a temporary and experimental measure while-the-negotiations v/ith Labour were taking shape and the probable upshot was framing itself,that the threatened increases of price should be postponedand that the Exchequer should stand the loss for the timebeing.      In the result there has been,  on balance, no increase between the 1st December, 1939, and the 1st January,1940, in the Cost of Pood Index and a rise of only one pointin the Cost of Living Index - caused mainly by an increasein the cost of clothing.      Since the 1st January it has,however, been necessary, for varying reasons,  to make somealterations in the price of staple foods which may involve an increase in the Cost of Food Index for the 1stFebruary of some 2? points (representing about l  points forthe Cost of Living Index).(b) The cost to the .Exchequer of thepresent subsidies,.4. The cost to the Exchequer to-day of the subsidies nowbeing paid is in the region of  1,000,000 a week or, say,at the rate of  50,000,000 a year.     The constituents of this

-oast^arLd the saving of points on the Cost of Pood Indexrepresented by each constituent are as follows:-  a week       Estimated points in food Index.Bread and Flour. 480,000 circa 6.0iMeat. 300,000 3.5 to 4.milk. 235,000 ? cheese. 12,000 .2Overheads, etc. 50,0001,077,000 circa 12.-As against these losses it is anticipated in thecase of margarine, that there will be a small gain not sufficient, materially to affect the Cost of Food Index.(c) Estimate of the cost of continuing the present subsidies.5. While  1 million a week is the cost to-day it isnot, in any sense, a measure of the total cost to theExchequer of a continuing policy of this character.      causes which may contribute to further price rises in the future -apart from the effect of any inflationary spiral which may,from whatever cause, come upon us - include possible rises in wages or other costs in the distributive trades, anyintensified public demand which could not be checked byrationing, further increases in freight charges and furtherinternal increases in price in the countries from which wedraw supplies.6. This last factor is incalculable and it may possiblybecome very serious.     It is not a matter of exchange rates.Even if the Treasury eould foresee every change in exchange rates with different countries which could take place during thewar - and obviously this is not possible - such knowledge would still be no guide to the course of prices0     During the last war the pound was pegged at only a shade below its fulldollar parity and the dollar itself always purported to be a-3-

gold currency:    nevertheless the cost of living rose immenselythroughout the world,  each and every monetary unit losinga great part of its power to purchase goods.7. Thus one can foresee only the immediate future.As regards that immediate future we can find some guidance in the fact that the Ministry of Pood have fixed their buyingarrangements in many cases for a substantial period inadvance.      Thus, as regards the principal foods, the positionis broadly as follows:-Butter and Cheese.    Contracts with Australia and NewZealand up to June and July 1940.Meat.    Contracts with Australia and New Zealand upto September 1940.Meat from the Argentine. Contracts until 51st March,1940Dairy Produce, from Denmark.    Arrangements pratically complete until 28th February, 1940.Bacon from Canada.    Agreement for a year, subject toreconsideration at quarterly periods.Sugar. Practically a year&apos;s supply purchased from empire sources.Tea.    Contract under consideration for a year&apos;s supply from Empire sources.The main omission, it will be noted is cereals, andthese in fact constitute the main risk.     Already since thebeginning of the war, the rise in the wholesale prices ofcereals is double that of other commodities.8. The rate of cost to the Exchequer of continuing thepresent measures for the stabilisation of staple foodstuffswould be in the region of - or not much in excess of -  80-100millions per annum.      It is not necessary to add, that, if theGovernment were so illadvised as to enter into a coinhtment onthis subject without a limit of time, there would be nothing to prevent the cost mounting until it reached figures

completely outside our power to finance.    It will not be forgotten that in the last war we finished with a cost of livingtwo and a quarter times as high as in 1914.III.  ANALYSIS OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT WOULDBE FEASIBLE TO STABILISE THE COST OFLIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE EXCHEQUER.9. The constituents of the Cost of Living Indexare as followsPer Cent.Food 60Rent (including rates)                   16Clothing 12Fuel and light other items, 410010o Since rents are already stabilised a decision to stabilise the main constituents of the Cost of Food Indexwould by itself go a long way towards keeping the Cost of living index steady since these items between them account for 76 percent of the whole.    The process of stabilisation could becarried still further by applying it to clothing?In the case of the latter, price fixing over the whole field is neither practicable nor desirable?   but it would prima faoej.certainly be possible to achieve a considerable measure of stability in this field (possibly without incurring any heavycharge on the Exchequer)   by the Government arranging for theprovision of standard clothing of various kinds and standard*     It is particularly important that,  if stabilisation is to be attempted, it should be applied to clothing, since, as will beseen from the following statement, the percentage increase in thecost of clothing in the first four months of the war was morethan two and a half times as great as that of any other group of commodities entering into the Cost of Living Index.-Percentage increase 1 Sept. 1939 to 1 Jan. 1940.FOOd    ..OODOOOOO. 500.ee. .o 14o 6^*0Rent       O.OOO0OO.O**)*OO.OO..OClothing 500..oaoo...o.*o 39 o 5c/oFuel and Light . a ......... 10.1%Other items Oo..o.....o..o     _5.5%All items.o o    12.5%

boots and shoes(and possibly underclothing^ as it was donetowards the end of the last war.    The possibility of devising a workable scheme on these lines is now being examined by the Interdepartmental Committee on economic policy, which should be in a position to submit a reportin lhe near future.    The actual elaboration and negotiation of a detailed plan would however require some further time.The price of fuel and light could,if necessary be controlixlat the cost of the Exchequer, but the administrative difficulties would be considerable (especially in the case of gas) and in view of the small part played in the Index bythis item (8 per cent) it would not be necessary or desirableto extend control to this field.    The other items entering the Cost of Living Index (4 per cent) may be dismissed asnegligible.11. It will be seen from the foregoing that, other things being equal,  it would be possible for the government at the cost of the Exchequer to secure for a time a fairlyclose approach to stabilisation of the cost of living asreflected in the Cost of Living Indexr    In fact, of course,the extent to which such a policy would be practicable would depend on the magnitude of the subsidies v/hich would be involved,  and the extent to which the Government wereprepared to place so heavy a burden on the Budget.    Itshould be observed also that any policy of subsidising price is subject also to another important factora    When theprices of goods are kept at an artificially low level the

the demand for such goods is greatly increased and inconsequence their consumption greatly stimulated.    Intime of war when it is necessary to curtail civilian consumption artificially low prices operate in preoiselythe opposite direction to that desiredo    It followstherefore that a policy of price stabilisation can only he -applied, to a-JJuuited list of (admittedly very important) --commodities, namely:-(a) Staple foods which can be rationed^(b) a- small number of articles - of whichbread is the leading example - thedemand for v/hich is not much affected by its price? and(c) clothing etc. of types commonly used..feymembers-of the lower income classes(in so far as&apos; workahle -sx;hera&amp;s can be devised).12. There is a further aspect of the policy of&apos; -   atabillairig jthe cost of living which, should be borne in mind.    If -expenditure- on staple necessd-b-i.escontrolled both as to price and as to quantity by government action,  the surplus of purchasing power-7-

remaining in the hands of the public after theyhave bought these necessities would be greater than would otherwise be the case, and the supplies which might be bought with this purchasing power would be reduced bythe need to maintain the ration of necessities.    Theprice of uncontrolled articles would therefore risesubstantially faster than would be the case if no attempt were made to control the prices of the necessities-,IVo    ALTERNATIVE POLICIES NOW OPENTO THE GOVERNMENT.13. At present all that we are gaining from anunannounced practice of letting the food control work ata loss ofj say9  1,0005000 a week is the indirect effectof a halt in the rise of the cost of living in limiting the insistence with which wage claims are being pressed.During the last six weeks the advantage has been important.The slowness of Labour leaders in general to accept an understanding in regard to wage increases is not due to alack of appreciation of the force of the Government^arguments or of the dangers of a spiral? rather it is due,in part to the great difficulty they would experience in persuading their followers and in part to genuine doubtswhich they feel as to the realities of the economicsituation and as to the probable duration of the war;there is good reasons it is understood? to hope that,,unless the extremists prevail, after a time the attitudewill improve.    In the meanwhile, with Labour uncompliantand with claims for wage increases from big industriesfollowing each other with great frequency,-there s,eems no- reason to doubt that

the halt in the rise of prices at the moment when itoccurred had a beneficial effecto     But the type ofadvantage gained was essentially transitory and the methodunsuitable for continued use r.nannouncedt     There arealso clear indications that the Exchequer could not continue on the present lines without some public statement being demanded as to the line being pursued andthe policy underlying it0140       In these circumstances there are three possiblepolicies open to the Government:-(i)   The Government might abandon the present policy, and arrange for food prices to beraised by stages until they cancel the whole,or the main part, of the Exchequer loss0(ii)    The Government might continue their present policy and even extend it, eg,, into thefield of clothing, but without attempting tosecure anv understanding,from organised labour in return.     We contemplate that in thesecircumstances, the contribution which theGovernment was making to the maintenanceof the cost of living would be announced,though no pledge would be given that itwould be continued indefinitely, and at thesame time the Government view would be made known that while the cost of living was beingthus stabilised no demands for increased wages should be put forward apart from reasonableclaims from industries which have not yet received advances during the recent wagecycle.(iii)   Finally, an attempt might be made to come toa general understanding with organised labour on the following lines.     For a periodcovering, say, the next six months after which the matter would again be reviewed/;-(a) The Government, in addition to keepingrents stable, would do its best tomaintain   something approaching stability of price of the main constituents of thefood index and would examine thepossibility of limiting any further risein the price of clothing, possibly bythe means of placing on the marketstandard clothing at a regulated price.(b) Labour as a movement, while not standing in the way of applications for wage increases of a reasonable character in thecircumstances of each case from industries which have not yet received advances duringthe recent wage cycle would discountenanceor discourage any further pressure for wage increases beyond that.

150       We are definitely of the opinion that it would &quot;be unwise at the present time to abandon the present policyof holding at any rate the prices of the main foods atsomething below their true cost.     The onset of the war,involving increased costs in many directions, and higher prices for imported goods owing to- the depreciation of sterling, set in motion a cycle of wage increases whichhas not yet fully spent itselfo     Some industries havereceivedwage advances and otheishave not.     Until thiscycle is complete, it would be dangerous to allow newdisturbances in the Labour market to occur.-16.       The question,  therefore, presents itself to usin this form;    shall the Government attempt to secure an understanding with Labour in return for an undertaking asfar as possible to prevent the cost of living from increas-ing, or shall it rely on the substantial.- stabilisation ofthe cost of living to prevent wage demands occuring withoutany explicit understanding with Labour?     The latter coursemay seem to throw away a powerful bargaining weapon fornothing, but in fact we believe that, in this respect,the difference between the two policies is smaller thanappears at first sight,17.       The Government can come to no more than an understanding with representative Trade Union leaders;for in fact such leaders are not in a position to guarantee the fulfilment of any bargain that they maymake with the Government0     They cannot go further than theycan carry leaders of individual Unions or their rank and file.      It is well known that grave shortages of labour are likely to be felt in a number of industries,     It willbe obvious to the workers in these industries that their labour can command a higher price than before the war, andit will be impossible for Trade Union leaders to implementany undertaking with the Government to make no demands for

wage increases when the rank and file know that theycan he obtained,,     In these circumstances the most that can he hoped is that the wage increases demanded willbe moderate in character018.       On the other hand, an agreement with representative leaders though it would not be binding on Labour, would be binding on the Government.     Itmight therefore happen that the Government would find itself in the position of having to meet increased costs due to Increased wages paid to workers in the munitions industries, v/hile at the same time payingout subsidies on staple foodstuffs as part of anagreement under which the wage increases should nothave occurred:.19.       A further difficulty lies in this facto     If ageneral understanding is reached for a period of, say,six months, the cost of buying supplies abroad mayin the interim have risen seriously0      In that event,if the arrangement cannot be continued, the jumpin the cost of living when it did come might be veryconsiderable - so much so as to furnish then by itself a most potent cause, for increased wage demands.As mitigating this difficulty., however, it may be pointed out that the Exchequer is not limited inchoice to keeping the cost of living where it is now or letting it find its own level.     Partial stabilisationcould be renewed at some intermediate point whichreduced Exchequer locses and mitigated the jump inthe cost of living without &quot;^oing the whole way.

20,       Our conclusion is therefore that the policyof subsidising the cost of living should he continued and if necessary extended to clothing;and that the fact that these subsidies are being paid should be announced..     It should be made plain,however, that the Government could not undertake tosupport any particular level of prices for necessitiesindefinitely^ without regard to changes in costs abroador wages at home.      It should also be made plain thatthe Government expected that so long as it pursueda policy of price stabilisation in regard to the necessities of life, no claims for increased v/agesshould be made except reasonable claims from industries which have not yet received advances during the recentwage cycleo     It would at the came time be necessaryto avoid any suggestion of a formal linking betv/eenwages and prices021.       The present Cost of Living Index would not reflect adequately the effect of a Government policyof price stabilisation, for it contains a number ofarticles which would be outside the Government scheme,and excludes, or includes only to an insufficientextent, a number of articles within ito     It wouldbe quite impossible however to discontinue thisindex without causing grave suspicion in labourcircleso     Nevertheless, we think it would be desirableto--supplenient, this index by a special War Cost ofLiving Index based on the necessities of life, andweighted in accordance with the rations which it willbe possible to make available0

V.    SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AMDRECOMMENDATIONS.22. We therefore summarise our conclusions andrecommendations as follows:-(a) we thoroughly endorse the policy adoptedin the beginning of December, 1939 to stabilise iie price to the public ofcertain staple foodstuffs ^t the costof the Exchequer, thereby to a largeextent stabilising also the Cost ofLiving Index;(b) we consider that, notwithstanding thecost to the Exchequer (estimated tobe at the rate of  50 millions perannum at the present time).* it isdesirable that the Government, as their contribution towards the pre-vention of the vicious spiral ofwages and prices, should decide to stabilise as far as possible for,say, 6 months by maintainingartificially low prices for thestaple foodstuffs already subsidisedand possibly by preventing rises inprices of some types of clothingentering into the Cost of Living Index;(c) both in the public announcement referredto in (d) below,  and also in any sub-sequent discussions with the Trade Unions,the Government should avoid any formallinking between wages and prices andshould deprecate such linking;(d) it is desirable that the Government shouldmake known their policy as recorded in(b) above, in the form of a consideredstatement,  drafted to secure the maximumpsychological and moral supx^ort for theprinciples involved;(e) we recommend that the statement of theGovernments policy referred to in (d)above should be made on the 51st January,1940,  at the next meeting of the national joint Advisory Council by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, who should make it clearthat the Government have decided at a heavy cost to the Exchequer to adopt thispolicy during, say, the next 5 months as their contribution towards the problem ofwages and prices;    and tha.t they hope thatfor their part organised Labour, while notstanding in the way of applications for wage increases of a reasonable characterin the circumstances of each case from

0 o.&apos;).^industries which have not yet receivedadvances during the recent wage cycle,will make their contribution towardsthe prevention of the vicious spiral bydiscountenancing or discouraging or, ifpossible, restraining any pressure for wage increases beyond the extent indicated above;(f) while   it   would be both impracticable and undesirable to attempt in wartime tomodify the basis of the existing Cost ofLiving Index it would be of great advantage to the Government and also generally in wages negotiations, if in addition therewas established a second Index, whichmight be termed the War Cost of living index:-(i) which paid regard to the effect onworking class consumption of reducedsupplies either through rationing orotherwise;    and(ii) which included only those items whichtogether constituted the Direnecessities of life:(g) we have accordingly invited the Minister ofLabour, in conjunction with the Treasury,the Ministry of Poods end other Departmentsconcerned,  to prepare a scheme for the intro-duction at the earliest possible moment ofa War Cost of Living Index (to be maintained in addition to the existing Cost of living index) on the basis indicated in (f) above.SIGNED ON BEHALF OP THE COMMITTEE:-JOHN    SIMCN.Chairman.id Terrace, S.W.I.23rd January, 1940.
