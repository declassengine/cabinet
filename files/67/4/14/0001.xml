TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.POSSIBILITY OF UNITED STATES CO-OPERATION IN PREVENTINGCERTAIN VITAL COMMODITIES FROM REACHING GERMANY,RUSSIA AND JAPAN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister for Economic Warfare.WE circulate to the War Cabinet a memorandum on the possibility ofUnited States co-operation in preventing certain vital commodities from reachingGermany, Russia and Japan.II.R. H. C.January 19. 1940.WE wish to bring to the attention of the War Cabinet an important question in regard to the control of metals and other essential commodities which hasbeen raised very confidentially by the United States Administration.2. Early in December, Mr. Morgenthau, the Secretary of the United states treasury, informed Mr. Purvis, the Chairman of the Anglo-French PurchasingBoard in America, that the President had under consideration certain proposalsfor preventing further supplies of essential alloys and other raw materialsreaching Germany, Russia and possibly Japan. The President saw in theseproposals &apos;&apos; grounds for the conception of a future policy for the maintenanceof peace by depriving aggressor nations of essential war materials.&quot; Theseproposals, it was explained, had developed out of certain suggestions madeprivately to Mr. Roosevelt by Mr. Bullitt, the United States Ambassador inParis.3. Mr. Morgenthau went on to state that the United States administration had secured an undertaking from the Climax Company not to ship molybdenumto these countries until further notice, and enquired whether similar action couldbe taken by British Empire producers of nickel, and whether France and theUnited Kingdom could offer United States producers any compensation bystimulating their own consumption of molybdenum. At the same time he asked what other products in addition to steel alloys was capable of relatively easycontrol, mentioning as an instance quartz crystals.   Mr. Morgenthau suggested10831   [20656] bPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.SECRET. Copy No. 1W.P. (G.) (40) 14.
that his economic adviser, Mr. Walter Stewart, and Mr. Purvis should co-operate with the principal American supplying companies and some steel experts in a comprehensive study of the question. He asked for a reply representing the combined British and French views. Mr. Purvis informed His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington of these conversations, and they were reported toLondon for consideration by the Anglo-French Co-ordinating Committee (Chair-man, M. Monnet), which directs Mr. Purvis&apos;s activities in the United States,in so far as they are concerned with Anglo-French supply interests.4. While the answers to these questions were under consideration here, theState Department issued a letter to United States manufacturers indicating thatit was hoped that no applications would be made for licences for export of &quot; anyaircraft, aircraft armament, aircraft engines, aircraft parts, aircraft accessories,aerial bombs or torpedoes &quot; to countries whose armed forces were engaged inbombing or machine gunning civilian populations from the air. They furtherinformed producers of molybdenum and aluminium that these commodities were regarded as included among the things which it was hoped would not be exported.5. Just before Christmas, the Anglo-French Co-ordinating Committee inLondon replied, giving detailed answers on the technical issues raised with whichit is unnecessary to trouble the Cabinet. On the general policy the Committeeauthorised Mr. Purvis to inform Mr. Morgenthau that they warmly welcomedthis approach and appreciated the helpful attitude of the United states administration, and he was authorised to inform the United States Administra-tion that suitable experts could be sent out from here to give all necessary information and assist in any discussion with the United States officials. TheCommittee pointed out to Mr. Purvis, however, that, whereas France and theUnited Kingdom had naturally imposed a complete embargo so far as germany was concerned, they had so far confined themselves to rationing supplies to Russiaand Japan to provide against their possible re-export to Germany. Mr. Purviswas accordingly instructed to ascertain if he could, whether the United StatesGovernment contemplated a complete embargo against all three countries.6. On the 2nd January Mr. Purvis telegraphed that the United states administration^ idea appeared to be that further discussions might usefully be pursued &quot; by informal joint groups representing the Governments concerned,including the Canadian Government, who have been kept informed, and workingconfidentially and utilising the help of various industrialists from time to time.&quot;The present general position of the United States was that &quot; as a neutral nationan &apos; all or nothing &apos; policy expressing itself in the form of moral embargoes orinability to supply owing to other demands, was much easier than the rationing of other neutral countries.&quot; Mr. Purvis added that he had made it clear that theAllied position was quite different in certain cases and that rationing might be theonly course, particularly, for instance, in the case of nickel to Japan. To this noobjection had so far been raised by Mr. Morgenthau.7. The Anglo-French Co-ordinating Committee have now agreed in principlethat M. Rist and Mr. Ashton-Gw-atkin shall proceed to the United States ofAmerica to help Mr. Purvis in the conduct of these informal and confidentialconversations as soon as may be required. (Mr. Morgenthau has apparentlyindicated that they should not come immediately; a delay of ten days or a fort-night has been indicated.) In order that no misunderstanding shall arise owingto the different attitudes and different motives of the Allies on the one side and america on the other in instituting any form of embargo, it is necessary that some general line should be laid down for the guidance of Mr. Purvis and the Franco-British experts as to how far they can go in their unofficial talks.8. The attitude of the Allied Governments towards Russia and Japan isperfectly clear as far as risk of re-exportation to Germany is concerned, but otherwise is governed by widely differing considerations. So far as Russia isconcerned, the position of the Allied Governments is determined by her more orless open hostility towards us, her action in Finland and the recent Leagueresolution &quot;appealing&quot; to members &quot;to refrain from any action which mightweaken FinlancLs power of resistance.&quot; While there is no absolute embargo on exports from the United Kingdom or other Empire countries, restrictions are for
the moment so stringent as in practice to prevent any important consignment ofa key commodity being exported. In the ease of Japan also there are Leagueresolutions to be taken into account, but in present circumstances His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom might hesitate to give any more practical effect to them than they have done hitherto, while the French Government maybe even more reluctant&quot; to make any move in this direction, threatened as theyare on the northern frontier of French Indo-China by the Japanese expeditionin Kwangsi. Generally speaking, however. His Majesty&apos;s Governments in theUnited Kingdom and the Dominions are following a policy of keeping Japanshort of raw materials which she desires to purchase in the British Empire. to turn this system of rationing into an embargo might entail serious economic difficulties, quite apart from &quot;the special misgivings from the point of view ofdefence to which it might give rise in Australia and New Zealand. The Govern-ments of Australia and New Zealand made it clear that they were reluctant to despatch expeditionary forces overseas (as they have now agreed to do) without adequate assurances as to the attitude of Japan. The Dominions have alsoshown concern recently lest valuable Japanese custom shall be lost as the resultof war restrictions, notably in connection with sales to Japan of Australian wool.9. Neither India nor Burma have yet gone so far a^ to apply a system of rationing to Japan, but it may be assumed that, if they were asked to join in an embargo, they would share these misgivings. India, moreover, happens atpresent to be engaged in important commercial negotiations with Japan, and herapprehensions as to the possible consequences of playing a prominent role indrastic restriction measures against Japan, for example, on the sale of Indianmanganese, would naturally be enhanced by this fact. The position in theColonies and Dependencies is that licences are issued for exports to China and japan at the discretion of Governors; export licences for Russia, however, canonly be issued after consultation with the Colonial Office.10. On the other hand, we are most anxious to obtain the co-operation ofthe United States of America in the restriction of supplies, e.g., oil and cotton,to Germany and contiguous neutral countries, and any such restrictions are boundto create economic difficulties in the United States and to provoke internal political trouble for the Administration. When the course of the war cannot before seen, and when all that is certain is that Ave are fighting for our lives, it isclear that the Allies cannot afford to reject any friendly approach by thePresident of the United States, nor fail to examine to the full the potentialities of the joint control of essential raw materials which Mr. Roosevelt has tentativelyoutlined.11. It is hardly necessary to emphasise further the very great importanceof the American offer. It applies to certain materials of supreme necessity tothe enemy; so necessary that, in the view of many qualified people, includingHerr Thyssen, it is through shortage of these very ferro-alloys that the german war industries may quite possibly collapse during the course of the year.Usually it is His Majesty&apos;s Government who have had to approach neutral countries with a view to making war trade agreements which will curtail their exports to Germany; but here is the most important of the neutrals coming-forward with proposals to suspend entirely the supply of these essential war materials to Germany. The situation, however, is a peculiar and a delicate one for the United States of America, both in view of her foreign relations and ofher internal politics; and there is much to be said for Mr. Morgenthau&apos;s choice of semi-official channels for the conduct of the negotiations; nor, since the initiativecomes from him and the President, are we in any position, even if we wished, tosuggest that they should be conducted otherwise, e.g., through His Majesty&apos;s embassy. Mr. roosevelt&apos;s idea no doubt is to explore to what lengths the UnitedStates Administration can go by arrangement with the industries concerned tomake things as difficult as possible for our enemies, overt and covert, withoutappearing to have taken sides or to have increased the probability of the UnitedStates of America becoming involved in the war. It is, however, clear that theco-operation which is offered to the Allies must be formulated and defined muchmore explicitly than it has been up to now.12.   So far as the French and British Governments are concerned, theimmediate object of the conversations should be to enlighten the United States[20656] B 2
on the details and practical application of our economic warfare policy, on whichthe United States Government appear to be very inadequately informed. In sofar as there is merely a question of the United States taking complementarymeasures by instituting comparable restrictions on supplies of vital commodities to our enemies, there can be no question but that we should show warm apprecia-tion and gratitude. The President and Mr. Morgenthau have, however, shown some disposition to go further than this, for they have already suggested that,as nickel can to some extent be substituted for molybdenum as an alloy in makinghigh-grade steels, the Canadian nickel companies should place certain restric-tions on their sales to dangerous countries, including Japan. The implicationhere would seem to be that, if the United States of America restrict the saleof molybdenum to please the Allies, Canada should restrict the sale of nickel toplease America. As a matter of fact, in circumstances which are related belowthe two Canadian nickel companies ai-e at present refusing to take any new-orders for Japan. They are informing the Japanese that the matter is not inthe companies&apos; hands, but depends on military necessities. This action by thecompanies does not either in fact or in principle imply that the Allies areprepared-to join America in putting pressure on Japan. A further source of difficulty in reaching a joint policy arises from differences of technique. TheUnited States Government are not employing their legislation to control exports,but are using their influence on American industries and firms to persuade them not to export to undesirable destinations. The position in Canada is similar tothat in the United States. In the case of the United Kingdom, exports are controlled and. if necessary, restricted by legislation; that is to say, by the directact of His Majesty&apos;s Government, which would become directly open to a protestby Japan.13. Before the European war it is true that Great Britain and Franceconsidered various suggestions for putting joint pressure on Japan : all thesefoundered on the rock of Franco-British doubts whether effective American helpcould be relied on in a crisis. Now America hints that she is not only preparedto collaborate but actually to take the lead. Meanwhile, France and the UnitedKingdom have become involved in a life-and-death struggle in Europe. the commodities which have been mentioned as possibly calling for restriction includenot only the principal ferro-alloys, chrome, nickel, molybdenum, tungsten,vanadium, columbium, tantalum and to some extent manganese, but also mineraloils, copper, carbon black, tin, rubber, quartz crystals and industrial diamonds.To cut off supplies to Japan of many or all of these might entail very serious consequences and, if there were any question of our showing readiness to collaborate in restricting her supply, the Allies could only proceed along theselines with complete safety if the U.S.A. were ready to guarantee them against those consequences. A direct request for such guarantees would not only be unlikely to succeed, but might even produce a reaction in the opposite direction.Furthermore, there is now beginning to manifest itself in Japanese policy atendency to experiment in conciliating the democracies. There is a good deal to be said for avoiding the appearance of a final determination on the part ofthe democracies to have nothing to do with such an experiment unless and until we are convinced that it is not a serious endeavour to meet the United States and ourselves on grounds of principle.14. In all the circumstances probably the best line which Mr. Purvis andMr. Ashton-Gwatkin could take, in close co-operation, of course, with theCanadian representative who is to be associated with them in the discussions,would be :  (a) To express the whole-hearted welcome which the Allied Governments give to the United States suggestion in so far as it is designed to preventre-export of any commodities by Russia and Japan to Germany or by japan to Russia; and their readiness to co-operate in the necessary arrangements.(b) To give any necessary guarantees that Japan should not receive from empire sources goods which could be used to replace supplies formerlyobtained from United States sources but now cut off by United Statesrestrictions, in so far as such measures are excusable by reference toour domestic needs and military necessities.
(c) To suggest that both sides should continue to concert to limit supplies to japan to the level of her domestic consumption in a normal, i.e., pre-&quot;&apos; incident,&quot; year. To Japan all three countries concerned would giveas reasons for these restrictions their domestic needs and their militarynecessities.(d) To urge that the list of commodities which is to be restricted for japan should only be extended, and then progressively, if the development of japanese policy made this appear expedient.(e) To point out that, whereas the United States Government contemplatedoperating restrictions by means of arrangements with the trade, theAllied Governments have worked theirs through export licensingsystems, which give them a definite political responsibility; and to enquire whether the United States Government can adopt a similar procedure, and if they cannot do so, to point out that the Allies fore-see possible dangers of Japanese resentment translating itself intoretaliatory action which might have consequences on their war effort.(/) To refer to their Governments if the United States proposed any bargainon the line that, if the United States imposed a complete embargo on certain supplies to Russia and Germany, the Allies should equallyimpose a complete embargo on certain other supplies to Japan.(g) To avoid being drawn into discussion of any immediate commitmentagainst any State on the ground that she was an aggressor or guilty of bombing civilian populations and to point out, if necessary, that&apos;theAllied Governments must keep their hands absolutely free in matters that affect their conduct of the present war; but to hold out hopes thatthey would be ready to consider later on, preferably as part of ageneral peace settlement, any proposal which Mr. Roosevelt or theUnited States Government saw fit to put forward in this connexion.15. It may be convenient to elaborate one final point mentioned in para-graph 11 above which arises out of the United States suggestion that the Canadiannickel companies should agree to suspend sales to Japan. During last quarterJapan placed orders for 1,635 tons, of which 800 have already been delivered,and the balance of 835 tons are due for delivery this month or next. TheJapanese have also asked for delivery of a further 2,000 tons later in this quarter.Her average pre-&quot; incident&quot; consumption was at the rate of some 400 tons amonth, though in 1937 and 1938 her average monthly taking was 600 tons, andin 1939 nearly 1,000 tons. The United States have asked that the Canadiannickel companies should enter into no further commitments to Japan pendingthe full examination of the whole question which they have posed. The canadian government have been kept fully informed, and are believed to be ready toco-operate in a policy of suspension pending the outcome of the present discus-sions. Having taken steps to prevent the sale of molybdenum to Japan, theUnited States Government would naturally be entitled to ask that we shouldtake steps to ensure that the Japanese did&apos; not increase their purchases of thepossible substitute alloy nickel. Mr. Purvis does not, however, appear to appre-nend a request for the complete cessation of nickel supplies to Japan. He statesthat he has emphasised that the Allied position is quite different and thatrationing may be the only course, particularly in the case of nickel to Japan;he adds that no objection has so far been raised, and his belief is that therewill be no objection to rationing Japan on the basis of domestic needs. Ifthe Japanese monthly ration is cut down to the 400 tons pre-&quot; incident&quot; level,there could be no question of any increased supply to Japan any more than there could be of re-export to Russia or Germany. However, Mr. Purvis advises that&quot; any assurances to Japan in advance of&apos;joint expert examination will excitesuspicion and hurt larger issues involved&quot;; and Mr. Norman Robertson of theDepartment of External Affairs in Ottawa favoured avoidance of commitments to Japan beyond the 835 tons contract balance, pending further proposed expertexamination of control possibilities. In the circumstances both the Mond NickelCompany and the Fauconbridge Company, as stated above, are, for the present at any rate, suspending any further orders for Japan when once the above-mentioned balance of 835 tons has been supplied. This decision of the nickelcompanies has been reported by telegraph to Mr. Purvis, who replied that this
was very helpful to him and might presently ease the situation. It may be thatin the face of Japanese protests it will be inci^asingly difficult to maintain an absolute refusal. In this case the Canadian Government may find it necessaryto meet a part of the Japanese demands by a rationing arrangement and, subjectto the concurrence of his Canadian colleague, Mr. Ashton-Gwatkin should endeavour to persuade the United States Government that 400 tons a month forthe present would be a reasonable ration for Japan. The drastic cut, meanwhile,should be explained to the Japanese as due to military necessities.16. We have consulted the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on thosepassages in the above paragraphs which concern the Dominions, and he thinks itdesirable that it should be made clear that so far Canada alone has been informed of the proposals and associated with the discussions, as her interests are at onceaffected as a large supplier of nickel. Australia, New Zealand and the Unionof South Africa have comparatively little interest in the commodity aspects ofthe question, but the general anxiety felt by Australia and New Zealand vis-a-visJapan has been referred to above. Even though the adoption by the UnitedKingdom Government of a policy of sterner rationing of certain commodities to japan, or the imposition of an embargo, might not call for positive action ontheir part, Australia and New Zealand would be equally, and indeed from theirgeographical position even more, exposed to resentment or retaliation on the partof Japan. When, therefore, the present exploratory discussions have reached a stage where wider questions of policy come to the War Cabinet for a decision, itwill be necessary that all the Dominion Governments should be fully informed and consulted.17. We have also consulted the Secretary of State for India and Burma,the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of Supply, all of who mare in agreement as to the general line recommended above for the guidance ofour representatives in these very important, though unofficial, conversations withthe President and his representatives.HALIFAX.R.
