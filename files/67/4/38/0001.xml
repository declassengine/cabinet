DRAFT TELEGRAM TO HIS MAJESTY&apos;ambassador IN WASHINGTON.My telegram Noc 16.    HisMajesty&apos;s Governmenthave now decided to authorise the High Commissionerfor Palestine to issue regulations controlling sales of land by Arabs to non-Arabs as contemplated inWhite Paper of May9 1939.    In a separate telegramI am communicating to you an outline of these regulations.    Following paragraphs of this telegramcontain material for your use in explaining situation to Dr. Brandeis and his friends, if you think thisdesirable.    It seems to us that courtesy may requirethis explanation in view of the terms of theirtelegram of 15th November, but you may think it unnecessary and undesirable to make such an approach to them.    This material will in any case enable you &quot;todeal with any other Jewish representations.    Itshould be substituted for observations contained inmy suspended telegram No. 943 of v/hich no publicuse should be made.    For your own information, ourreason for this substitution is that whilst we havenot withdrawn from the policy stated in the white paper we are anxious not to arouse fresh controversiesby a public reassertion of our position which mightbe considered provocative.    You should not in any.event give following information to Dr. Brandeisor others until day before the land regulations area.

being published in Palestine, and then only fortheir confidential information, and not for publication.If Dr.Weizmann is in or near Washington, I should be grateful if you could convey same to him confidentially.I will let you know as soon as possible date of publication of Land Regulations which v/ill be in nearfuture c2. It is generally recognised that the outbreakof war has projected into international affairs newconsiderations of paramount importance.    In the opinionof His Majesty&apos;s Government the fate of civilizationhangs on the issue of the war and the German treatmentof Jews shows conclusively that a happier future for world Jewry depends on the victory of the Allies.3. Recognition by the people of Palestine ofthese tremendous issues and of the fact that Jews and arabs have a common interest in the defeat of NaziGermany has brought about a cessation of strife andnew disposition to co-operate in that country.    HisMajesty&apos;s Government are anxious not to disturb this state of affairs and they would have preferred ifit had been possible to postpone for the duration ofthe war any action in Palestine which might tend to revive political controversy,4o But the land situation presents a special problem of exceptional difficulty and urgency. The status quo is not being maintained for sales of land are still

proceeding without regulation and as will he shown thesituation is being continuously altered in a v/ay which islikely to present His Majesty&apos;s Government before long witha state of affairs calculated to prejudice gravelyprospects of agreement between Jews and Arabs05o       In order to understand the position it is necessaryto trace history of land problem since 1930, when Sir JohnHope Simpson first warned the Government that owing to thenaturally increasing Arab population and their methodsof cultivation there was already a serious congestion of population over most of Palestine and that there v/ascomparatively little land left for settlement by newimmigrantso     Subsequent investigations all confirmed thisview.The Royal Commission of 1936 expressed their unanimous agreement with the general conclusions of earlier investi-gators on the land problem0     They recommended that transfers of land from Arabs to Jews should be allowed only where itis possible to replace extensive by intensive cultivation,that is to say, in the plains, and not, at any rate atpresent, in the hillso      The Royal Commission stated withouthesitation that at present and indeed for many years to come,the Mandatory Power should not attempt to facilitate the close settlement of Jews in the hill districts generally.So far as the plains were concerned, the Commissionconsidered that with due precautions land might still be sold to the JewSo     They also held that further settlementof Jews in such areas as were possible could best besecured by means of large scale development by publicutility companies, but they felt bound to state, in order toprevent Vkidue optimism, that at present such areas were fewand, as far as the Commission could see, to be found only

in the plains and not in the hill districts.6.       The Woodhead Commission, who examined in detail the possibilities of partition, confirmed the conclusionsof the Royal Commission that, with the existing standardof cultivation and capital resources of the fellaheen, theland in the hill districts of Palestine is alreadycongested.     They recommended that the greatest cautionshould be exercised in regulating the transfer of Arabland to Jews in the extensive areas which under their proposals would be excluded from the Jewish and arab states and would be retained under Mandatory control.    Intheir view transfer of Arab land to Jews in the &quot;mandated&quot;areas should be permitted only when it was clear that theland in question was capable of closer settlement and when such settlement would result in benefit to Arabs and Jewsalike.     They were, however, unable to take an optimisticview of the possibilities of additional agriculturalsettlement in the &quot;mandated&quot; areas.7.       His Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that itwould be dangerous to ignore any longer the clear warningsfrom a series of authoritative and impartial Commissions asto the serious and growing congestion of the Arah population in certain areas.     Although these Commissions have sometimesexpressed differing views on other matters, they have all been consistent and unanimous in urging the necessity for control of land sales0     Leaving aside the obligations ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government towards the Arabs under Art.6 of theMandate and looking at the question merely from the practical point of view, if land sales remain unrestricted even for the duration

of the war,  there is likely to arise a 11 landless Arab&quot;problem of such dimensions that it will be extremelydifficult to find any solution to it0      Nothing is more likely to contril ute to the possibility of renewed bitternessbetween Arabs and Jews, and to further violent disorders,than the existence of a considerable landless Arab population,and in fact some restrictions on land sales are essential ifwe are to establish good government in Palestine.8. The outbreak of war has not affected the urgency ofa solution.      Land purchases have not ceased.      On thecontrary the High Commissioner reports that purchases arestill being made and there is plenty of evidence thatZionist organisations are talcing active steps to raise funds for the particular purpose of land purchase in Palestine.9. After full examination of all these considerationsHis Majesty&apos;s Government feel that they have no alternative but to authorise the High Commissioner to proceed with theland regulations, providing for the delimitation of zones inwhich land sales from Arabs to Jews should, at any rate forthe present, be restricted, prohibited or remain freerespectively.      It cannot reasonably be argued that these restrictions will involve undue limitation on Jewishdevelopment.      Land purchases will not be stopped;    they canbe continued on a considerable scale in many areas which contain very good land,  and the Negeb, to which importance is also attached by Zionists, is being reserved as a&quot;restricted&quot; and not a &quot;prohibited&quot; area.      There is roomas well for considerable additional Jewish settlement onthe land which they already own.10.. The proposed regulations do not lay down boundariesbetween free, restricted and prohibited areas which are toremain fixed for all time,      It will be open to the High

Commissioner in the interests of Jewish settlement,  if heis satisfied that the &quot;rights and position&quot; of the arab population will be duly preserved, to review and modifyany orders passed relating to the prohibition or restriction of the transfer of land,     The policy of thePalestine Government is directed towards the developmentof the land and the improvement, where possible, of methods of cultivation.     A good deal of attention hasalready been devoted by the Departments of Agriculture and education to raising the standards of Arab husbandry, andit should be possible to make steady progress in thissphere of education when normal conditions are restored.11. Another consideration is that this proposal to concentrate Jewish settlement in certain broad areas will facilitate a solution of the Palestine problem ultimatelyon federal lines, if that should prove to be the best solution.IS. Finally, it cannot be too often repeated thatsomehow and at some time the Jews and Arabs in Palestinewill have to learn to live together in peace.      In theview of His Majesty&apos;s Government the continuation of whollyunregulated transfers of land from Arabs to Jews is boundto exacerbate the present differences between the two communities, and thus postpone indefinitely the harmonywhich alone can bring contentment in Palestine.     Alreadysince the war there are signs of an improvement in Jewish-Arab relations and His Majesty&apos;s Government would befailing in their duty if they did not attempt to remove any obstacle which still stands in the way of the further development of so desirable a movement.
