(G) (40)9.COPY KGWAR CABINET.SUPPLY -JT.0 LI AIT PC./SR.Note by the Chancellor&apos; of the Zkcchecruer.1.Cabinet all touch on the problem of how to secure the labour,and especially the skilled labour, required to achieve thescale of war prodiiction laid down in oup plans.      this problem is of such importance that I think the War cabinet should have before them an Inter-Departmental Memorandumrecently considered by the Ministerial Committee on EconomicPolics;- (Annex &quot;A&quot;), together with the record of the discussioron it at the Ministerial Committee (Annex &quot;B&quot;).      Thismemorandum shows that if the proposed programme of theFighting Services is to be fulfilled, it will be necessaryto draft into the engineering, aircraft and shipbuilding industries no less than 1,550,000 additional workers by july/Sept ember of this year, and a further 850,00--- workers by july 1941, making a total of 2,180,000 additional workers ascompared with the present time.2. The magnitude of this problem is shown by the fact thatin the last war about 700,000 nev/ entrants were brought intothe metal trades between July 1914 and July 1916, whereas inthe present war we are faced with the need for finding 2,200000recruits in the shipbuilding, engineering and aircraft indus-tries in a period of equal length.     What is now called for is,therefore; an effort in the first two years of this war three times as great as that in the last war.

1153. It is clear that this vast distribution of labourcalls for the use of every possible device for economisinglabour and for steering it away from activities which are relatively unessential for war purposes and into the strategic industries.      Ho doubt further light will be thrown on this problem by the Report on our war effort in relationto our national resources, now being prepared under the guidance of Lord Stamp.4. Meanwhile., the following are among the methods oftackling this problem which should, no doubt, be considered:-(i)    The fullest use should be made of existingengineering labour by the process of sub-contracting on the widest possible scale:(ii)    Steps should be taken to ensure that, subjectto the most stringent examination ofexceptions,  engineering labour should beemployed only on purposes directly connectedwith our war effort:(iii)    Means should be found to open out thepeculiarly acute &quot;bottle-neck11 created bythe shortage of skilled labour through theadoption of dilution (including the intro-duction of female labour) and the more evenspreading of the available skilled labourthrough the whole of the engineering trades:(iv)    A long-range policy should be adopted oftraining unskilled and semi-skilled labour to undertake skilled work through direct or indirect encouragement to employers and through the expansion of State facilitiesfor training.(Intd.)

117month, to he reached &quot;by the third^yjear^ojf^war^^s^o^ Ho.L.F.(39) 8).3B       The question was considered at an interdepartmental conference held on the 30th September, under the Chairman-ship of the Ministry of Labour, when it was decided thatthe necessary first step was the collection, upon a uniform and comparable basis,  of detailed statistics from theseveral Departments concerned, of the labour required for thepurpose of the proposed programme,,     This was arranged bymeans of a Sub-Committee the membership of which included the statistical experts of the Departments, and annexedhereto is a copy of the Report submitted, by this Sub-Committee on 29th November.     This report deals with theestimated labour demands of the three Service Departmsnts,and of the industrial and aircraft production, and in thefollowing paragraphs of this memorandum,  an attempt is madeto relate this demand to the total labour supply of thecountry in the industries concerned.     The present memorandum is submitted with the approval of the several departments, vis;    The Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry,Ministry of Supply, Board of Trade, Ministry of shipping and Ministry of Labour and National Service,4,       Before considering the problem in detail, it is worthwhile to compare the general position to-day with that in theearly days of the last war.     On the one hand, there hasbeen an increase in the population of Great Britain from41,700,000 to 46,400,000 - with more than a corresponding increase in the numbers engaged in industry - and thiere hasalso been a considerable increase in the output per headoOn the other hand, the equipment required for the armed forces to-day is more extensive, more complex and more

cosily iiL terms of labour than was the case 25 years ago,and the supply has to be completed, under the proposed pro-gramme, within a much shorter time limit.     Moreover, finance and exchange difficulties will impede the purchase ofmunitions etc., from abroad, and will necessitate theproduction of a much larger proportion in the United Kingdom.5. The annexed report of the sub-committee givesprovisional estimates, prepared by the responsible Depart-ments, of the labour required for carrying out the proposed programme at two different dates, viz.  (a) July - September,1940, and (b) July5 1941.      It will be seen from the reportthat the estimates of the Departments include the requirement of sub--contractors as well as of contractors, but thatthey &quot;exclude administrative, -i;echn-Loal. and clerical staff.They do not however take into account the labour requiredfor the export trade or for meeting the needs of the civilpopulation, and this is dealt with in paragraph 8 below.6. It is necessary to bear in mind that these estimates -as also the further estimates in the following paragraphs of this Memorandum - deal only with labour demand and supplyand that they are based on the assumptions (a) that adequate supplies of the essential raw materials will be maintained inthe requisite quantities (b) that the necessary factory spacemachinery equipment,  and power supply will be available atthe due dates,  and (c) that the carrying&apos;out of the programme will not be impeded by extraneous factors such as enemy action and, in respect of building work, bad weather,      Seri-ous delays or difficulties under any of these three headswill reduce the rate of progress and will later requireadditional labour to complete the programme within the specified time limit.7. So far as can be seen from the figures supplied,there is not likely to be any serious problem of labour

supply in connection with the building, chemicals and explosives industries (including ammunition filling).There appears to be a sufficient supply of skilled buildinglabour9 and much of the additional labour required in thetwo latter industries is unskilled.8. The bulk of the production for the war programmefalls within the engineerings aircraft and motor vehicleindustries, instrument and metal goods manufacture and shipbuilding and repairing.      For the purpose of calculating the total numbers required in these industries., it is neces-sary to add to the labour requirements of the war programme the requirements of the export and home trade.      The mainten-ance of exports is essential for the prosecution of the war,and estimates have been made of the anticipated rate of export of the products covered by these industries.      Fromthis it is possible to estimate roughly the labour require--ment.      It is more difficult to estimate the number ofpersons required for the production in these industries ofgoods for purely civil needs3 which must include the repair and maintenance of industrial plant throughout the countryand some replacement of obsolete machinery.      It is obviousthat production for sale to the civilian population will bevery substantially reduced during the war;    high taxation and the diversion to war production of raw materials would bring this about  even if labour were available.      Theestimates have been based on these assumptions.      To postponeto a greater extent than has been assumed the replacement of .obsolete plant would weaken our competitive power in world markets.9. The estimated totals of the labour required, on theabovebasiSj in the industries concerned is set out in thetwo tables attached as appendices to this Memorandum viz.Appendix I for July - Septembers 1940 and Appendix II forJulys 1941.

10.        Included also in Appendix I and Appendix II areestimates of the total labour available in the industries concerned.     These estimates are based upon the returns ofthe numbers of insured persons aged 14-64 at July, 1939 inthese industries.     A deduction has been made for men takeninto the Forces since July, and also for the administrative,technical and clerical staff (which are excluded from the totals of labour required - see paragraph 5 above).     IToaddition has been made for the inflow of labour into the-industries in, question since July last, and no deductionhas been made for the present and prospective recruitment ofmen from these industries under the national Service (armed forces) Act, 1939 - except for Service tradesmen.      Theinformation needed for making an estimate of these numbersis not available.(It may be mentioned that the industries included in the group&quot;Engineering and Metal Goods&quot; ares- General, Electrical and marine Engineering, Scientific and Photographic instruments and apparatus, general ironfounding, electric cable andapparatus, brass and allied metal wares, and miscellaneousmetal goods-marrufacture.      These ,are-the industries thatprobably correspond most closely with those for which figures as to labour demand have been furnished.      The numbersavailable under the heading &quot;Aircraft, motors &amp;c.&quot; includethe numbers in the cycle industry - including motor cycles.)11.       The comparisons shown in Appendices I and II betweenthe numbers estimated to be required at the specified datesand the numbers estimated to be now available, in theindustries concerned may be summarised as followss-

It seems clear that, owing to (a) the recruitment of men for the armed forces, (b) the need for maintaining and even increasing thelabour force in the export trades and (c) the difficulty of arranging the rapid diversion to war production of men now employed on non-essential work,a considerable proportion ofthe increase must be met by the employment of women.     For someof the processes women are in fact more suitable than men,but this does not apply to the whole group;    indeed,for many of the processes the employment of women is not practicable.12.       Normally the proportion of women and girls employed inthe more important of the industries in question is not large and the estimates of the Admiralty and Ministry of Supply donot distinguish between the numbers of men and women required.The following Table shows the percentages of males and femalesrespectively included in the estimated total numbers insuredaged 14-64 at July, 1939.

In electrical engineering and the manufacture of metal goods the proportions are very much higher - rising.toov-er^ALO-per^oent^-An some industries.13 It is unlikely that the proportion of women in ship-building and repairing can be increased.      In aircraft manu-facture, the Air Ministry consider that 30 per cent, of thelabour force required for their programme might be women.In the engineering and metal goods group excluding aircraft,motors &amp;c. women at present represent 21 per cent, of thenumbers insured.      In four of the industries the proportionis already over 30 per cent,  and to raise it to 30 per cent,for the group as a whole would obviously require a very large increase in the number of women employed in general engineer-ing.      As the Departments have not been able to supply separatefigures of their requirements in general engineering a calculition can only be mad$ for the group as a whole and on this basis the increases required by July-September,1940 and July

1941, may be divided, in round figures among.males, andfemales as follows:-w Industry Group	Increases required by July-September, 1940 in			Males              Females i                 j		TotalEngineering and Metal Goods Aircraft, motors &amp;c.

To meet the above requirement for women there is anample reserve, and this will include a considerable numberwith industrial experience of some kind.    The requirement for men must be met mainly from the existing supply ofindustrial workers,    After making deductions in respect ofmen engaged in the industries covered by the preceding-paragraphs, men now serving with His Majesty&apos;s Forces, and

men in the administrative, technical and clerical groups,the total field is of the order cf 10,000,000.    This willbe reduced as men are called up under the National Service(Armed Forces) Act., 1939, and Table C of the Sub-Committee&apos;sreport, annexed hereto^ gives the estimated numbers, viz.a total of 775,000 by September, 1940, and a total of1,400,000 by September, 1941.,    A further reduction mustbe made in respect of men engaged in essential industries where the labour requirements may be expected to expandduring the war,  etg- agriculture, mining, shipping andraw materials,    When these deductions are made the effective supply figure is somewhere between 6,000,000 and7,000,00D0    Included in this total is a number of men atpresent unemployed.^ &quot;whose&quot;absorption into industry would represent a nett addition to the total productive effortoThe remainder include men employed full time in civil defence services, men engaged, in home and export trades(other than those already covered)..- and men engaged in production and distribution for the civil population.    as has already been pointed out (parac 8 above), there mustbe some contraction, under war conditions, of the total of exports and of home consumption, and it is largely from among the men so released - together with those nowunemployed - that the labour requirement for men in thewar production industries must be provided,,160 Although the statistical calculations in thismemorandum (and in the appendices) are necessarily tentativeand are based upon assumptions that can be tested only by,experience, it would be unwise to assume that the labour requirements for the proposed programme have been over-statedo    To make good-the deficiency in numbers alone will^be a formidable task and will involve transfer from other 1

occupations. on an immense scale0    It is tr-ae that in thelast war the numbers employed in the metal industries andin Government establishments increased by 570,000 men and647,000 women, or.  if the nett replacement of men who leftto join the Forces is taken into account, by 755r000 men and647,000 women,,    But this transfers er of labour occupied thegreater part of the four y.;ars 1914-10, and it was assisted,inter alia- by the high and constantly increasing rates ofwages that then operated in industries directly concernedwith war production^    There is not the same scope todayfor the introduction of women into certain industries -for they had already gained a considerable footing in the interval between the two wars - and the special inducementof high wages must now be ruled out both on general grounds and because of its effects upon the export trade,170 Mere nuirfeers^however, will not meet the need0    Thereal problem is that of suitable skilled labour, i-eQ? of ensuring the economical distribution of the existing supplyand of providing additional workers in a number of highly skilled occupations, for it is upon this provision that the required production will depend.,    A certain number of skilled workers will be available from those who are of or above the ages specified in the Schedule of reserved occupations and are at present employed upon non-essential work, and also from those who, though below the reservedages, are not likely to be required for service in the armed Forces as tradesmen.,    It is not possible to give anestimate of this number, but the total is negligible in comparison with the requirements-,    A rough estimate ofthe additional numbers likely to be required in ooxre ofthe more Important skilled occupations can be obtained by calculating the numbers of these key men now employedin the Inn^fttvj^Q concerned and assuming that a

proportionate increase will be required for the total labour expansion indicated in para. The followingTable gives some idea of the additional numbers likely tobe required and compares these numbers with the totals atpresent engaged in the occupations specified:--Occupation,,		July - September, 19403		July,  1941e		Estimated numbers available - Autumn, 1939,	Estimated Total numbers required0	Defic-iencies,	Estimated Total numbers reqxiir ed,	Defic-iencies.,Tool makers (including machine and press tool makers) and precision fitters.

This is a difficult operation which wasonly accomplished in the last war aver a long period oftime and under conditions which were in many respects easierthan those which obtain today0

is.Pending consideration, of the questions raised &quot;by this investigation into the labour requirements of the present programme, further investigation into the possibility of an expandedprogramme has not been attempted,disclosed by this statistical investigation may properly be summarised as follows:-makes it impossible to give any guarantee -particularly in respect of the first year -that either part of the proposed programme canbe completed within the specified time limit.The Departments concerned with productionexpress grave doubts about the position.They point out that, at the present time, thereis already a serious unsatisfied demand incertain branches of production for additionalskilled labour at important productioncentres, and that, unless this and the furtherdemands now arising are promptly met, thewhole time table of expansion of supply will&quot;be set back.     They contend that, for technical reasons, it cannot be hoped that the amountof dilution which can be obtained in the first year will be adequate for the programme   -(a) because the progress of dilution is necessarily retarded by the serious difficultyof persuading individual employers and localtrade unionists to agree to the introductionof dilutees even after general agreement hasbeen reached and also because of the realmanagerial problems involved;    and19.It is submitted that the position.The information at present available-3 4-

(b) because in certain ranges of industry the productive capacity of newly introduceddiluted labour is reduced as a result of thegreater complication of the machines.The shortage of machine tools in relation to requierements alone makes it unsound to count on expansion on the scale desired unless-skilled labour_.jc.an be -diverted to man fully the larger-units of production as they are completed;    and. present progress--offers littlepromise of this being done in the time desired.2.       The above is the deduction from the facts and estimates of labour supply and demand,and is not intended to convey a Departmentalview that the pro-ramme is clearly beyondachievement.     There are other factors to betaken.Into-account-including, for example,the question whether it is imperative, forthe purpose of the war programme,.to adhere to the standard of equipment hitherto contemplated, or whether that standard could safely be modified to any extent that wouldease the problems ..o -jj2^iixs^tid.al.J5J^o^-Ulo-^tmxu^_aruilabour demand.3. Despite the difficulties, the present programme should remain as an objective, tothe attainment of which every effort shouldbe directed during the next few months.k-       To this end, from the labour point ofview, urgent consideration must be given toa number of questions, of which the following are the more important:-

(l)    It is essential to the rapid developmentof maximum production that the existing supplyof highly skilled workers is distributed andemployed to the best advantage;(2)   Present production methods are notnecessarilj&apos;&quot; the most economical,  and it maybe possible by new methods to secure economies in the use of the iabsu highly skilled labour;(3)    The utilisation, under the ,:work-spreading&quot;scheme, of some of the smaller workshopsshould be developed, but it must not be over-looked that this method cannot be applied tothe manufacture of certain vital products, andthat it may reduce the amount of skilled labour that would otherwise be available for-employment in the big production limits;(h)    Further measures of dilution vvij.1 benecessary to achieve any considerable expansionof production.(5)    There is urgent need for a large-scaleextension of training facilities, either directly by industry in the workshops, or bythe Government in Training Centres:     Theposition of men so trained in relation to service with the Forces requires further examination by the Departments concerned;(6)    The question of amending the presentconditions governing the employment of women on night work requires urgent consideration.20. These questions will have to be submitted tothe organisations of employers and workers in theindustries concerned,  and the urgency of the matterrepresented fullj^ and frankly to them.      If the present programme is to be achieved, it is plain that measures will have to be attempted on lines more drastic than anything hitherto planned^      It will not be possibleto secure the necessary progress without the consentand co-operation of those bodies,  and experience suggests that this will require the full weight ofCabinet authority and direction.(Sgd,)    Humbert WolfeChairman of Conference,,Ministry of Labour and National Service..13th December. 19^9.-IS-

Statistics of labour required for carrying out the approvedWar programme.^   Report^ofa Sub-Committee - Annex.1.        At a meeting of representatives of the Departments concerned, whichwas held at the Ministry of Labour and National Service on30th September; 1939, it was arranged that a Sub-Committee of representativesunder the Chairmanship of an officer of the Ministry of Labour and NationalService should undertake the production of statistical information, upon a uniform and comparable basis, as to the labour required for carrying outthe programme approved by the War Cabinet.2. So far as land and air forces are concerned the programme in relationto which the estimates of Departments have been framed may be summarised asfollows:-(a) the equipment and maintenance of an Army of 20effective Divisions by the end of the first year of war,sof 50 Divisions &quot;by the end of the second year and themaintenance of that Force throughout the third year.Supply to be provided for the equivalent of 5additional Divisions in respect of assistance to Allies.(b) An aircraft output of 2,300 machines a month (includingthe Fleet Air Arm) to be reached by July, 1942.Estimates have also been prepared on the basis of the programme now in hand for the Navy and ilercantile Marine.     Future requirements will not be lessthan this programme and may be greater.In so far as they come within the scope of the Departments which have contributed to this Survey the requirements for Air Raid Precautions havealso been included.5. The Tables in the Appendix summarise the estimates as to the labour required for the execution of the approved programme, which have beenprepared by each of the Departments concerned.Table A relates to industry and the industrial Civil Establishments ofService Departments taken together.     It shows the total labour forcerequired in the industry g &apos;jnpj5 named at the dates specified, estimated,so far as industry is concerned, on the basis explained in later paragraphs of this report and in the notes accompanying the Table.     Tables 3 and Crelate to the personnel required to be added to the Forces, including bothtradesmen and non-tradesmen.     They showj not the total numbers requiredto be in the Forces at the dates in question, but the numbers required tobe recruited during specified periods.     The figures are required in this form in order to provide, in conjunction with those in Table A, an estimateof the demand for the purpose of the war programme, on the man power nowoutside the fighting Services.It has not been possible, in general?    to carry the Estimates beyond theend of the second year of war, but the requirements of most departments will,in fact, continue to expand beyond that point.x For the period June - September, 1940, the estimates prepared by theMinistry of Supply relate to the numbers of workpeople who could beemployed having regard to the factory accommodation and machine toolequipment expected to be available in that period.

It is necessary to emphasize strongly the provisional character of thefigures in Table A so far as they relate to the needs of industry.     Exceptin the case of aircraft manufacture the Departments concerned have not found it possible to carry out any comprehensive and detailed investigation of thelabour force now employed on their programmes,       as to the labour requiredfor future expansion.     The estimates presented Ivu- l:e.: prepared on the basisof such information as was available and they are subject to revision in thelight of further experience.4.     Table A in the Appendix gives separate figures for certain broadindustrial groups.Except for aircraft productxon and the industrial Civil /Ij^ablish^atsof Service Departments, *ccupati&apos;.v.ial statistj.es of the labour hoy/ employedon war work do not exist, nsr is there information in the Departments concerned;other than the Air Ministry, from which estimates, on an occupational basis,of future requirements could be compiled.In order to deal with the problems of labour supply and the allocation of skilled labour between industry on the one hand and the fighting services onthe other, with the consequential problems of training and dilution, suchstatistics cannot be dispensed with.     They are the only means by which presentand prospective shortages of workers in &quot;key&quot; occupations can be disclosed, andthey are essential for the purpose of formulating plans for meeting suchdeficiencies.   The fulfilment of the war programme will depend upon asufficiency of man-power of the various types required.In the absence of such detailed statistics this report can only give abroad outline on an industrial basis of the man-power needed to carry outprogrammes an the scale envisaged.The major part of the field covered by the programmes is limited to acomparatively small number of industries.     Having regard to the fact that theproblem of labour supply in relation to demand varies between different industries the industrial sub-division given in the Appendix has been carriedas far as practicable with the information available.5.     It has not been possible for all the Departments to supply separate figures in respect of men and women and Table A in the Appendix therefore shows onlythe total labour requirements in each industry.6.     The estimates shown in Table A, do not include the production of rawmaterials, the manufacture of a number of essential ancillary commodities,or the labour needed for transport.They do not cover the labour requirements of the export trade or themaintenance of industry for the normal needs of the civil population.The figures for building labour are the figures compiled for the BuildingPriority Committee and they relate only to carpenters and bricklayers.     It isprobable that there will be demands for building labour other than thatspecifically required for Government purposes included ill the Table.In compiling the estimates it has been assumed:-(a) that coal, iron and steel and other materials will be provided in the requisite quantities;(b) that the factory space, machinery equipment and power supplynecessary for fulfilling the programme will be available;(c) that in the case of building work, contracts will be completed bythe due dates.     Factors such as bad weather, may hinder progress,and such delays, if extensive, would lead to an increase in thelabour required for later periods.. v G. W. TURNERSigned)   N.

(1.1, ) (39) 51)-PROGRAMME.At the request of        Oha i*iaa&quot;n.r /OLFEsummarised the report of the interdepartmental conference as follows:-(i) the investigation, was statistical in character and was related to theprovisional programme already submittedto the   .;ar Cabinet by the Land ForcesCommit tee;(ii) owing to the increasing   romplexit-y of equip-ment the increase of tne population by millions since the war of 1914-18 did not mean that larger or &quot;indeed as large l^Andforces could now &quot;be expected;(iii) the conclusions of the report wereconditional on raw materials, factoryspace and machinery equipment being-available j and on there being noextraneous interference with production;(iv) there was no prospective shortage oflabour in the building, chemical and explosives industries.      shortagesmight, however, te expected in theengineering, air-craft and motor vehicle industries, instrument and metal goods manufacture and in shipbuilding or-^   &quot; giving j(v) in these industries provision would haveto be made for the maintenance of exports (though on a somewhat reduced scale) and civilian needs necessaryto replace and repair machinery as necessary, and to make goodobsolescence;

(vii) the question of the extent to which thislabour could he found by employing v;omenhad been considered.     Having regard tothe type of work involved? the AirMinistry felt that the proportion ofwomen engaged in the factories for whichthey would be responsible might be raised to30 per cent )of - the &quot;total estimated deficiency,bu.t the Ministry ox&apos; Supply could notachieve so high  an increc^se.      There were considerable reserves of female labour;(viii) there would also have to be a large increase in the number of males employedin these industries.     It v/as the viewof-the Conference that ^-f - but only if -the question of skill could be ignored, it should be possible to meet thedemands for male labour also;(ix) the question of skilled labour was,hoY/ever, crucial.      Pearly 70,000additional highly skilled men would berequired by July 1&apos;9UQ and 130,000 by july   19hl.     It would not be possible to train additional skilled men in these numbers from the beginning;   but bypromoting men of less but still  considerableskill the deficiency might be to. some extentrepaired.       The men promoted would not. have as great an output as those now inthe trade.     Further economies could alsobe made in the use of skilled labour bythe modification of workshop practice which at present showed considerablevariation in the demands made on skilled labour;(x^. the Conference had not thought itneoessary to .coxisideu?- the. feasibility of programmes larger than those requiredto give effect to the existing decisionsof the War Cabinet regarding the futuresize of the Forces;(xi) in the light of their examination of thequestion the Conference had not felt it possible to guarantee that the proposedprogrammes would be completed in the timelaid down.      The supply departments inparticular called attention to theincreased difficulties of dilutioncompared with those experienced in 191k--18, in view of the point to whichdilution had already been carried, and ofthe complexity of some of the machinesnow used;(xii) the  question of the utilisation ofexisting stei^Pe^ labour, which vras nowsometimes being wasted on unnecessarywork, would require attention;-24-4

(xiii) &quot;&apos;./ork spreading1&apos; to use the smallerworkshops should he encouraged as faras possible;(xiv) the extension of training facilities shouldbe encouraged.      This was &quot;best carriedout by industry rather than by theGovernment, and requests by industry for financial assistance on this account should be resisted;(xv) the question of permitting women to work at night, even though undesirable on social grounds, would have to he considered.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL called attention to theimportance of the work carried on hy dilution officersin the last war, and asked whether similar steps werebeing taken to-day.THE MINISTER 01 SUPPLY said that this was theintention.      It was important, however, to proceedcarefully so that the relations of the Ministry ofLabour v/ith the National Joint Advisory council should not he made more difficult,,THE PARLIAi ILITTARY SECRETARY TO THE MINISTRY OPSHIPPING called attention to the fact that hy meansof dilution the United States in the last war had beenahle to increase its output of ships from 200,000 tonsa year to 3,000,000 tons a year./at this point the Committee adjourned until 5*30 p.m.J7

THE CHAIRMAN said that the paper before themcontained, in section h of paragraph 19,  six practicalrecommendations for alleviating the prospective labour shortage in the munitions industries.      before considering these proposals he wished to refer to thestatement in Section 3 of the same paragraph thatdespite the difficulties, the present programme should remain as an objective, to the attainment of v;hich everyeffort should be directed during the next few months.The considerations brought forward in the report did notappear to support this conclusion.      He recognised,however, that it v/as not for the interdepartmental conference to question the scale of preparation laid downby the 7ar Cabinet.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE said thatin his view the conclusion to which the Chairman had referred v/as directly contrary to the argument of thereport-.      He hoped that this report would not go forward to the War Cabinet independently of the inquiry into theexchange and shipping position which Lord Stamp&apos;s Surveyv/as to undertake, and which might be expected to givesupporting evidence to the conclusion which he had suggested at the meeting held that morning.THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY OF THE MINISTRY OFSUPPLY said that though he recognised the force of the argument previously advanced by the President of  theBoard of Trade that it would be unwise to prejudice theexport trade in an effort to carry out an impossible-26-

programme,  the Ministry of bupply was at present &quot;bound bythe instructions of the   far Cabinet.      His personal view was that an ulti ate progre:-me for an arivcy of the sizelaid down by the   &quot;ar Cabinet was not impossible providedthat,  say, the lower French scale of equipment   ereaccepted.TEE P--ILLL ii; II&apos; .1 by ::.ECPdlT RY OF THE MINISTRY OFSHIPFI1IG said that he hoped that his reference at themeeting held that morning to the difficulties of theshipping position would not he interpreted as an expression of opinion &quot;oha ; a war effort on the scale contemplated wasimpossible.      In 1317 a much larger war effort had &quot;beenmade on a smaller import tonnage than now seemed&quot;prohahle.THE CHAlRI/b-JT said that it would he desirablethat if any decision involving substantial presentexpenditure fell to be taken by the Ministry of bupplybefore Lord Stamp&apos;s investigations were complete, which arose out of the existing instructions as to the ultimatesize of the army, the impending decision should he reported to the present Committee.      He was not, of course,suggesting that the Ministry of bupply should cease to acton the &apos;,7ar Cahinet&apos;s instructions.     He did not proposethat questions involving merely an expansion in our supplies of raw material should he brought before theCommittee in this way,THE COMMITTEE then considered the six uroposalscontained in section h, of paragraph 19 of the paperhefore them.On the question raised in sub-paragraph (3)namely &quot;work spreading&quot; through the utilisation of smallerworkshops, THE CHAIKLiAlT asked whether the Ministry oiLabour were satisfied that all that could he done was&quot;being done in this respect.

MR. &apos;JOLFE said that though they recognised the difficulties involved in the use of the smaller firmsit was the view of the Ministry of Labour that more could and should be done,LORD STaMP said that the Chairman wouldrecollect that he had submitted a memorandum on this point.It seemed to him in the light of information that he had subsequently received that the question at issue was thepowers to be given to the ares Committees now being appointed by the Ministry of Supply.      In the last warthese Committees had been given power to place orders, andit was this which had contributed to their great success.THE PARLIAL3JI-JTARY SECRETARY OP THL MINISTRY OPSUPPLY said that he thought the new area organ!sation ofthe Ministry would improve the position.      Powers toplace orders had not been given to the Committees in viewof the difficulties these powers involved in maintainingproper Treasury control, but he did not think that theywould cause any appreciable delay.The Committee agreed:-(a) to approve in principle the six measures for lessening the shortage of skilled labour set out in section k ofparagraph 19 of the paper attached to paper No, E.P.(M)(39)51;(b) to invite the Ministry of Labour and theMinistry of Supply, in conjunction withthe    other Supply Departments, andin the .\ase of the proposal numbered (6),in oonjuncti m also with the Home.-Offioeto suggest praetical,steps to carry these measures into effect;(o)    to plaoe-on record that their approvalof the measures referred to in (a)above should not be taken to imply that they endorsed the conclussion 1contained in section &quot;3 of parogroph19 of the paper referred to above.
