Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (40) 16.WAR CABINET.RECRUITMENT OF PALESTINIAN ARMED FORCES-RELEASE OFBRITISH GARRISON.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.AT a meeting of the 19th October, 1939 (Cabinet 53 (39), minute 3 (b)), theWar Cabinet invited me and the Secretary of State for War &quot; to explore thepossibility of raising Palestinian forces with a view to enabling the regulargarrison of Palestine to be reduced.&quot; This matter has been examined between representatives of the War Office, Air Ministry, Foreign Office and ColonialOffice, and in the light of that examination I have reached the following conclusions : 2. The British regular force now in Palestine consists of 11 infantry battalions, 2 cavalry regiments and ancillary detachments. Of the infantry battalions three form part of the Middle East Reserve, and it is recognisedthat they may be withdrawn at any time if required for service elsewhere. Theremaining 8 infantry battalions and the 2 cavalry regiments (or an equivalentmilitary force) represent the garrison which the military authorities regard as necessary in present conditions for the purpose of restoring order and maintaininginternal security in Palestine.3. The fact that the function of the British garrison is the preservation ofthe internal security and not defence against external aggression has an important bearing on the question at issue. Asked for his views as to the possibilityof partly entrusting to an armed force composed of Jews and Arabs the internal security functions which are now performed by the British garrison, the HighCommissioner for Palestine replied in a telegram dated the 28th October, 1939.as follows : &quot; It is true that the present situation shows improvement owing to (a)general weariness, (b) genuine sympathy with the war aims of the democracies,(c) hope of ultimate political benefit; but on the other hand are the facts that(d) numerous armed gangs are still active, (e) intrigue from Iraq is likely tocontinue, probably with German support, (/) Arabs are essentially fickle andunreliable, and (g) Jews are determined to sabotage the White Paper somehow.Should it appear at any time that we were in serious difficulties either in Europeor the East, the course of events here would be determined by the strength ofthe garrison actually in the country and that strength or weakness can onlybe defined in terms of British personnel. Any increase in the numbers of armedJews and Arabs might well mean the need for more British to look after them.&quot;4. The High Commissioners conclusion is that, for the reasons stated above,the replacement of any part of the British garrison by a Palestinian force wouldbe unsafe. The validity of this conclusion is not in my opinion affected bythe improvement that has recently taken place in the local situation. I fear that the employment of Palestinian Jews for the purpose of disarming arabs and suppressing Arab disorder would inevitably rekindle the fires of Arabhostility not only in Palestine but in the surrounding Arab countries; and, inf20669]
the light of recent experience, I am satisfied that, for purposes of internal security,no reliance could be placed on a force of Palestinians whether -Arab or Jew.&apos;5. At the same time I recognise the political importance of making use tothe fullest possible extent of the offers of service which have been made by thepeople of Palestine. There is no objection to the enlistment for general serviceof individual Palestinians into British units of R.E., R.A.S.C., R.A.M.C. andR.A.O.C. in Palestine to complete establishments, &amp;c, and some 1,000 men arebeing enlisted in this manner. I agree that there would be no objection, providedthat suitable material is forthcoming, to enlisting from Palestinians up to 50 percent, of the coast and air defence units required for the defence of Haifa. Thiswould provide military employment for some 350 men.G. In addition, I see no objection to the recruitment of Palestinians (arabs and Jews) for service abroad as part of the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corpswhich has been formed. Such recruitment has, in fact, begun and is to be welcomed as a contribution towards the solution of the local unemployment problem. It may absorb up to a total of 5,000 men. This figure would heincreased if more Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps units were formed.7. I realise that for some time to come the available facilities for training and equipment will be strained to the utmost, and that any new combatant unitscould be trained and equipped only at the expense of units which are already inexistence. Moreover, for as long a period as can be foreseen, all equipment which can be produced will be required for units recruited from sources whosefighting value has already been proved. I recommend that for the present weshould not go beyond the enlistment of Palestinians for service in the coast andair defence units at Haifa, in British Army units of R.E., R.A.S.C., R.A.M.C.and R.A.O.C., and in the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps. If it is necessaryto indicate that some further opportunities of military service may in the future be made available, I contemplate that, should the occasion arise, Palestinians willbe accepted in further British units of R.E., R.A.S.C., R.A.M.C., and R.A.O.C.which may be raised for active service in any theatre of war when training andequipment can be provided. No public announcement should, however, be made which might prejudice recruiting for any units already authorised or forAuxiliary Military Pioneer Corps units.8. Turning in conclusion to the question of the possibility of reducing thestrength of the British garrison in Palestine, it is contemplated that whenrebellion has been finally broken and the relations between Jews and Arabs mayhave improved, and when the Police Force has been reorganised and established in fortified posts on the lines recommended by Sir Charles Tegart, it should be possible to reduce the British garrison to 1 motor battalion, 1 infantry battalionand 1 cavalry regiment. The preparation of detailed plans for the constructionof the Police posts (estimated to cost  li million) is now in progress. A grant-in-aid of  250,000 for this purpose has been sanctioned for the current year, andthe Colonial Office is in consultation with the Treasury regarding the provisionfrom the Exchequer of the further sums required. Subject to Treasury approvalof the provision of the necessary funds, the work of construction and there organisation of the Police Force will be carried out as quickly as possible.Sir Charles Tegart&apos;s scheme provides for the reorganisation of the&apos;Police Force,British and Palestinian, and - its redistribution in the fortified posts whencompleted : also for the addition to the force of a mobile unit of 500 (50 per cent,British and 50 per cent. Palestinian) for dealing with armed gangs of brigandsin the wilder and remoter parts of the territory.&quot;9.   To sum up, my conclusions are : (a) It is not practicable to replace the British garrison either wholly or partly by a Palestinian armed force.(b) We should continue to offer Palestinians the opportunty of enlistment forgeneral service in the following units only of the British Army : CD., &amp; A.A. units at Haifa,R.E., R.A.S.C., R.A.M.C. and R.A.O.C.,Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps.
(c) If   further  opportunities   of  military   service   should   be   required,Palestinians could he enlisted in additional British units of R.E.,R.A.S.C.. R.A.M.C. and R.A.O.C. for active service in any theatre ofwar if and when such units are formed. No public announcement tohe made which would prejudice recruiting for units, includingAuxiliary Military Pioneer Corps units already authorised.(d) It is not at present possible to reduce the strength of the British garrison.(e) When rebellion has been finally broken and the Police Force has beenreorganised and distributed in fortified posts on the lines recom-mended by Sir Charles Tegart, it should be possible to reduce theBritish garrison to 1 motor battalion. 1 infantry battalion and1 cavalry regiment. The implementation of Sir Charles Tegarfsscheme should, therefore, be carried out as early as financial considerations permit.10. The Secretary of State for War has seen this memorandum, and is inagreement with it.M. M.Colonial Office, January 20, 1940.
