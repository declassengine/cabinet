THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAjgSJTYjJg GOVERNMENT.SECRET.&apos; COPY NO.      1V.P.(G)(40)  2.&quot;WAR   CABINET.BROADCAST OF SHIPPING LOSSES.Note by the Minister of Shipping.The First Lord of the Admiralty has circulated a paper to theCabinet dated 11th January 1940 (W.P.(G)(40) 8).    In this paperhe asks for Cabinet authority for limiting the announcement of losses of merchant ships by the B.B.C. to weekly rather thannightly statements.    On this point I feel a little doubt, sincethe collected losses of a week might be expected to have atleast as depressing effect on the morale of men at sea   as theannouncement of the losses as they occur day by day.    I entirelyagree with the First Lord, however, that every effort should bemade to avoid giving an unnecessarily depressing effect to theannouncement of such losses.    It is obviously more difficult toput these losses into proper perspective within the limits of thebraodcast news bulletin than it is in a newspaper, and it mightbe thought that a weekly statement would occupy an even greater proportion of the news bulletin in which it was included than a daily statement.The First Lord&apos;s paper gives the Admiralty view thatannouncements of merchant shipping losses should be accompaniedby a statement of the numbers of vessels or their tonnage whichhave safely entered or cleared from British ports.    such information, is, I feel, likely to be misleading.    In the last war the practice was adopted of putting side by side with the losses (which in the worst period were almost entirely of overseas vessels) the entrances and clearances of all ships,whether engaged on overseas work or in the coastal trade, but these statements gradually fell into some disrepute as the public

began to realise that losses were much more serious than was indicated &quot;by the implied comparison.    At the height of thesinkings in the last war, a return might have shown 30 shipslost and 2,500 entrances and 2,500 clearances, whereas the realfacts were that almost all the lost ships were ocean-going vessels and that only about 140 such vessels had arrived, while2,360 vessels in the coastal or near-seas trades had arrivedv/ithout any loss.    In spite of the growing realisation of themisleading character of these returns, there was a reluctance to change the practice because the sudden cessation of entrancereturns, or the disclosure of the high proportion of overseasvessels which v/as then &quot;being lost, would have caused a shock tothe general public.It is true that most of our losses, which have happily been much less severe than in the period of the last war referred to,have recently been near our coasts.    But this situation might change ana the return again become very seriously misleading;    andit would then be difficult to change the form.It might be added that figures for entrances and clearancesare published in peace-time by the Board of Trade, but thepublication has ceased since the outbreak of war.    Entrances andclearances of shipping in United Kingdom ports are now very substantially be-low the pre-war level, and their publication mightbe used by enemy propaganda as a measure of the injury done toBritish trade.I hope that special steps can be taken to prevent the Pressor the B.B.G. from referring specifically to death or injury ofLascar or other coloured seamen.    These reports hive a disturbingeffect on Lascar and Chinese crews and increase the difficultiesof inducing them to sail to belligerent ports.J.G.Ministry of Shipping.15th January, 1940.
