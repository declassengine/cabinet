TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.COPY NO.W.P.(G)  (40)29,WAR CABINET.VOTE A ESTILiATES.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.The Estimates of each of the three service departments include a Vote A, which covers the maximum numbersof officers and men who may be borne on any one day during theyear,  and which cannot be exceeded without further Parliamentaryauthorityo2c      In the last war,  the Admiralty and the War Officecontinued to present substantive Vote A Estimates,  and I under-stand that no great objection would be taken ty these Departmentsif the practice of the last war were followed again, since novery accurate deductions could be drawn from the Navy and Armyfigures as to the number and nature of naval units or militaryformations to which they refer,     The case of the Royal Air force is, however,  different, since to publish a substantive Vote a would give the enemy valuable information as to the strength and organisation at which the expansion of the Royal Air Force isn! i &quot;. j ^ tQ d3c     High constitutional practice is  of course, in favourof laying substantive figures before the House of Commons, butit is not unreasonable that considerations of constitutional practice should, in war-time, yield to the vital defence needsof the country.      On these grounds, the Speaker, who has been consulted, raises no objection to the Vote A for the Roj^al A.irForce for the period of the war taking the form of -&quot;Such numbers of officers and airmen as His Majesty thinks fit.A.

4.     While, as I have said above, the same considerations of secrecy do not apply with equal force to the Navy and theArmy, I understand that the First Lord of the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for War would greatly prefer to refrain from publishing substantive figures and so avoid even the possibilityof helping the enemy.     Moreover, it is desirable that the three services should act alike in this matter.I therefore seek the authority of the War Cabinet toabandon, for the period of the war, the practice of presentingsubstantive Vote A figures, and to substitute a Vote A in theform indicated in paragraph 3. above.      The reason for thechange, which would also apply to the Supplementary Estimate ofthe current year, would, of course, be explained to the House,and I would suggest that it should be communicated to the leader of the Opposition before the Estimates are introduced.K.W.Air Ministry,2nd February,  1940.
