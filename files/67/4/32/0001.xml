Prom his reference to that subject in his letteryoudated January 17th to me, of which/have the text,  I anticipate that,when we next meet, Gandhi may take the opportunity to press me asregardB treatment of the scheduled castes as minority for purposesof constitutional protection.    I am aware of the care with whichthis delicate issue requires to bo handled and wish to he sure,in the event of Gandhi5s opening this question,  that what I would propose to say fits in with your own views and with declaredjjosition of His Majesty5s Government.2-. While he may not wish to push the issue quite so far ,general argument that Gandhi may possibly use is that when HisMajestyss Government accepted the Poona Pact of September 1932,they must be held to have agreed that depressed classes - orscheduled castes as they are now described - are not to be treatedas minority whether- for ptirposes of their representation in the legislatures or for any other constitutional purpose.    In other words, this argument would be designed in terms of present constitution to withdraw protection for scheduled castes underGovernor&apos;s special responsibility to safeguard legitimate interestsof minorities;    and calculated more particularly to ensure (Ythatin) any further stages of constitutional revision scheduled castesshoixid not figure among minorities or other classes for whomspecial protection under authority of Parliament might requireto be devised-3, True position as I see it is that throughout stages of constitutional/

constitutional discussions from Simon Report to (? enactment of)Government of India Act, His Majesty&apos;s Government and Parliamenthave recognised responsibility resting on themeelves (? to) secureprotection for scheduled castes- and while it is agreed (9 thatthey) stand on footing different from minority communities instricter sense (? of that) term, general (? demarcation) we have followed is in the constitutional sense to secure for themprotection of generally the same type as that provided forminorities,    That protection takes two main forms, vizo politicalrepresentation in Legislatures and protection under special responsibility of Governors (and of Governor-General ifFederation were introduced)*4, By common consent depressed caste representativesparticipated in discussions of Minority Committee of first and second Round Table Conferences and while the claim of Ambedkarat first Round Table Conference that depressed classes should betreated for electoral purposes as separate community was seen tointroduce serious complication,  (Minorities Committee Report,first Round Table Conferencd) nevertheless protection of depressed classes was accepted (Minorities Committee Report, second RoundTable Conference) as Integra.&apos;, part of general communal problem?5, This view was maintained in communal decision of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, but in order to respect position of the scheduled castes as part of the Hindu community, representation in their Case was different from representation given to the minorities in that they were retained as voters in generalconstituencies and provision for special separate constituencyadmit that for their representation in the Legislatures existingelectoral arrangements for scheduled castes now rest not on as I see the position, we can readilycommunal/

communal decision? tout on provisions of Poona Pact in which it wasagreed that arrangements in Pact should (? continue) untildetermined by mutual agreements6-. On the other hand we have consistently maintained theview that, while we declined to give a legal definition to term&quot;minorities&quot;, nevertheless for purposes of Governor1s special responsibility scheduled castes remain fully within protection bythat term?   This seems to have bean made abundantly clear ( atstage subsequent to Poona Pact) both by Joint Commii tee inparagraph 79 of their Report and in speech by Hoare in commons on 5th March 1955*      Even if scheduled castes were to cease tofigure among minorities for whom special representation is givenin Legislatures, nevertheless under terms of paragraph IK,Governors&apos;  Instruments, protection for scheduled ear;tes asminority within meaning of section 52(1) (c) would continue tobe fully secured.,7.-, In any discussion of these matters that Gandhi mayraise,  I would, of course, give him every assurance that we fully recognise Hindu sentiment on the subject of scheduled castes inrelation to the Hindu community of which they form part, buttowould(?endeavour/,put constitutional position to him generally onthe lines of the preceding paragraphs:    I shall welcome any suggestions that may occur to you and shall be grateful for earlyintimation of your views as   I shall need to be fully prepared on these matters before meeting Gandhi..&apos;   I had not been able toput my finger on any more explicit commitments of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in respect    o- f     scheduled castes, but if there are such commitments that I have overlooked,, no doubt you will let me know-

From Beoreta^o;f State to Governor--General.MllL^^^Jj^U.&quot; , v v431 o.     Personal.      X think it beet to reply in a perscf&amp;ltelegram to your official telegram dated  3rd January, 99 -G,, asit seems to me Impossible to answer it without exploring certainproblems about which it is of the first importance that you and ishould clear our minds,      Very briefly the problems relate to where we intend to go and by what route in the further conversationsyou hope soon to enter uporuSo      Let me first give what seems to me to be the answer to ghandi  if he raises the questions you anticipate about treatment ofScheduled Castes.      Present position of Scheduled Castes, so faras special representation goes, is determined by Poona Pact,,This was a contract which by its own terms is terminable only by mutual consent.      Accordingly -he question whether or not&apos; positioncreated by Poona Pact is to he &quot;carried on into any newConstitution is not one in the first, instance for you or HisMajesty&quot;s Government at all;    it is a question between casteHindus and Scheduled Castes..      For it is inconceivable that HisMajesty5s Government arid Parliament would attempt to impose,presumably if necessary by force, upon so considerable section ofthe Indian population as the Scheduled Castes (or the Muslims) a constitution purporting to be based on the principle of self&quot;government by the provisions of which that section declined to be governed.      This being so,  in this matter no less than in that ofthe relations between Hindus and Moslems the sine qua non to any advance is that there should first be agreement&apos; between theparties, in this case the caste Hindus and the Scheduled Castes.,as a condition of further progress,,3.      If I have rightly understood your plan you have so far been^ contemplating as the result of the forthcoming talks,  if allgoes well, the limited objective of the return of Congress to office/

Office with Muslims in provincial Cabinets, Hindu and Muslimpoliticians in your Executive Council and an early inaugurationof Federation with some modifications to suit the Muslims and states;      and that nothing more far-reaching need emerge for sometime.      1 am very doubtful whether you will get conversationseffectively going on this limited basis and if so whether theposition could be held for any appreciable time.      But even ifyou could for the time being stave off awkward questions fromGandhi about the implications   of, and the approach to   dominion status.! think it would be useful even at  this stage if we ourselves examined these questions and if possible reached agreement about theirs4o      I have already dealt in iny telegram of 24th JanuaryNo0 7? with the awkward question of the &quot;right to secede&quot;,      Thenext point that arises is whether the Dominion Status we contemplate is Dominion Status for a federated Indie or forBritish Indiac      I feel that we must stand firmly on the formeras the only practical basis for a stable and peaceful Dominion ofIndia.      We have to bear in mind however that the preamble to theA.ct of 1919 spoke of responsible self government for British IndiAccepting this premise the position is broadly as follows.      Weare committed to a radical re-examination of the present indian constitution immediately after the war,  and we are furthercommitted to granting India full self-government at some,  so farunspecified, date, but a date very much earlier than was contemplated by any of us as probable in 1935.      (Bull self-government is obviously connoted by &quot;Dominion Status&quot; whateverelse that expression may be held to connote)..      There seem to methree possible lines of approach about which we ought to clearour minds in advance;-(1) Are we to undertake to give effect to any Constitution whiIndians themselves frame and under which they agree to governthemselves,/

themselves,  this undertaking holding good even if it invol-  3forthwith complete removal of our control(2) Are we to make a more restricted offer to India, namely to implement any Constitution which Indians can frame in agreementamongst themselves, provided it contains safeguards satisfactory tous for the adequate defence of India,  the service of the debt, dueprotection for British public servants if retained in service or compensation if not retained,   the discharge of any remainingobligations to the States,  and possibly protection of Indianminorities9 :&apos; .(3) Are we to aim at a combination of (1) and (2), namely,an undertaking to implement any Constitution framed by Indians inagreement on the firm assurance that  the objects indicated in (2)will be secured, not by provisions An the Constitution Act,necessarily involving retention of powers exercisable by or onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government but by treaty which might well have a limited- duration&apos;;5o      1 do not suggest that these questions &quot;can be answered outof hand, still less that you should seek or encourage discussionof them in forthcoming conversations,  though Gandhi himself mightnot improbably raise similar issueso      But unless we are fullyconscious that they have to be faced,  and unless we are clear inour own minds as to their implications,  1 feel that there is some risk that in defining ox* re-defining our objectives we may use terms which in effect though not in intention will be ambiguous,  therebyexposing ourselves to the charge of insincerity and bad faith..If we took the line indicated in question 2, the result wouldbe the method of the Act of 1935 without any fundamental modificationof the principles on which the problem was then approachedo      Inother words having ascertained the views of India about a newconstitution we should then without- any attempt at disguise retainfor Parliament alone the right to determine how much of it couldbe f

be accepted.-,      But .1 think it unlikely that Gandhi and t*eCongress would accept this line of approach and that as econ. asit was realised that it,was in contemplation the further talkswould at once break dovm*      You may think J am pessimistic inthis regard but we ought  to face the possibility,,      As you know-,1 have the gravest doubts whether we shall find it possible tojustify in the face of world opinion after the war our presentcontrol in indiao      On one condition only would this be possible,;namely that we had offered self-government to India but&apos; herpeople had not been able to settle amongst themselves on adurable basis the terms on which they would accept and exerciseit, thus leaving us no option between abandoning India to civil war and chaos or remaining in controls      But in that case, itwould have to be clear beyond question that the offer of eelf-and government had been a real offer,&quot; incidentally our hands wouldhave to be not only scrupulously but demonstrably free fromany suspicion of using the method of &quot;divide and rule&apos;%6,      On either plan (I) or plan (3) Indian agreement is theessential first step to any progress.,  since as I have alreadyremarked in paragraph 2 it is inconceivable that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should attempt to coerce any considerable section ofthe Indian population to acquiesce in a Constitution which they thought would be injurious to their interests,,      It has .frequently astonished me of late to find from conversations you have reported to me how persistently the idea prevails amongstboth Hindus and Moslems that it is somehow within the power ofhis Majesty&quot;s Government to compel one community to agreeagainst its convictions to the demands of the other.     But it,seems equally clear to me that there will never be communalagreement unless the parties start on the assumption that whatthey are discussing is the conditions on which they Cangovern themselves without external control, or with suchext ernal/

external control only as they agree in demanding or fretiyac c ep c d70      These are the &quot;basic features of the problem as 1 see it, with no doubt many further problems,  some of the greatestdifficultys  in the backgrounds not the least being the problemof the States,,      But please let me have your.reactions on the basic problem in the first instance,  since until we have at anyrate discussed them thoroughly we ought not to reopenconversations,      I need hardly add that before we could proceed on the basis of either plan (1) or plan (.3)  I should have toget the War Cabinet&apos;s approvals and T may say at once that Xshould anticipate that they would not be prepared to stand forpian (1)p

IMMEDIATE.-127-S.    I am most grateful for your private and personal telegram of January 24th, Mo.77 and for the very useful opinionrecorded by Inskip.    If there is no objection I should be grateful if I could have for my own guidance the full text ofhis note by air mail.      I do not think any special attention has been given hers to the secession issue, but it is of courseone of the points that  I shall have to bear in mind.    I am fullyalive to the importance of avoiding any suggestion that we contemplate any such admission.2.        It is impossible for us to judge what gandhis line islikely to be.    Only indications we have are contained in his letter of January 17th, repeated in my telegram of January 23rd,which mentions (a)  independence,   (b) position of ScheduledCastes.    But it is clear that issues of considerable importance and delicacy may arise at very short notice,  and it would be ofgreat assistance to me to know beforehand the line which you arid,as may be necessary,  the Cabinet would wish me to take inregard to them.3.      My own feeling at this stage,  and subject to course of myconversation with Gandhi and any developments that may takeplace in general political situation here in between,  is thatessential thing so far as he is concerned is likely to befinding of some formula which will satisfy him as regardsfuture status of India;,  and our intentions in that regard.  Ifit was possible to achieve that,  it might then be practicable toget him back on to (a)  a small expansion of my Council as an interim measures coupled with (b) if we could, got the other parties into line,  revival at once of federal scheme (possiblyTelegram from Viceroy dated 28th January, 1940.

with minor modifications to meet Lie si ems and States) expedited,and with its preparatory processes telescoped as much aspossible,  the argument being used that that not only solvodproblem of bringing in States, which could not but bo a longand difficult business otherwise.; but that in other respectsalso it was swiftest and most reliable stopping stone to dominion status at earliest possible moment after war:    (c)  to try to turn the Constituent Assembly point  (? by) accepting infrankest possible way the necessity of working out and framing of proposals to His Majesty&apos;s Government once Fed--ration hasbeen established, by somebody representative of India as awhole, for those features of Dominions status which would haveto be settled and defined as part of creation of dominion status position,  e.g. in particular,  defence.The type of tiling one has in mind is either aCommittee of Federal Central Legislature which elected as provided in the   Act would be a really representative body,or possibly an ad hoc body containing one or two representativesexacted by each Provincial Assembly, plus an element elected by federal Central Legislature;  and probably 73IUS some official representatives on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  thoughdesirability of including that last element and on what basis would have to be further considered.    But all of this is,  as you will of course recognise,  wholly tentative,  and turn of discussions may clearly show that nothing of the sort would be practicable and that we must look for some other solution.4*      I now turn to specific points of major importance onwhich I should like to be certain that you and I are inagreement.(a)    Status.    We are,  I take it,  agreed that complete independence is out of the question and cannot be conceded:that the utmost trf which we can go is Dominion Status,  in ether

words &quot;Independence within the Empire&quot;.    Is there any objection to my using that phrase as equivalent to dominion status- ?    I am fully alive to the extreme importance of anything that I may say by way of defining or explainingDominion Status having regard to its possible repercussions on the position of existing Dominions,  and also on situation created by our undertaking that Dominion Status shall begranted to Burma:    and I am particularly -anxious, therefore,to have specific instructions as to what form of vvords I canuse.But we must be prepared to face up to the foots,firstly,  that I shall have to be in a position to be definite and that we cannot hope to evade the issue:    secondly,   thatwe cannot clearly assume that whatever I may say to Gandhion that point will not,  either now or later, be published.Dominion Stotus is,  I thin&quot;., nowhere precisely defined,  andit is in a word the sto.tus enjoyed by the present self-governing Dominions.    But precise relation of each Domini onte his Ma majesty s. Governtrent in United Kingdom may vary according to local circumstances.    In the cose of India,while India would be styled a Dominion,  it is obvious thatthere will have to be special -arrangements,  in particular-foout defence, probably also about communities discrimination,and,   to the extent that the various committees, etc.,hereare not able to reach agreement between themselves and.would wish for our guarantee, possibly some provision aboutthe position of the minorities.    The position of the states in relation to His Majestyrs Government and Paramount Powermay also call for special prevision.The Indian debt and service position are further items.In other words,  the Indian Dominion,  once we get down to working it  out,  Will be different in its make-up to otherDominions, but that is,  as I see it,  entirely clear with india being a Dominion and enjoying &quot;Dominion Statue&quot;.

5. It is conceivable too that Gandhi (there have beenhints of this) may wish for some differentiation in stylebetween India and the other Dominions.    We- have after all thestyle of hire,  and the fact that South Africa is called aUnions,  and Australia a Commonwealth.    A phrase such as&quot;Federation of India&quot; would be,  I should have thought,entirely unobjectionable.    But we can wait until that point is raised and if he takes it now, I will merely ask for time,to consider, and enquire whether ho has any suggestions as toname.6.        (b)    Constituent Assembly.    This is clearly going tobe a point of difficulty as Congress have unwisely committed themselves so deeply in relation to it.    Fortunately, on theother hand,  they have not committed themselves veryspecifically as to tho nature or scale of Constituent   Assembly,and there is,  therefore,  a good deal more room for bargaining.What I would like to do as you will have gathered from paragraph 3 above, would be to accept in fullest terms theprinciple of consultation with the people of India ( and withthat essential element the States)  as regards the (? form)of the new Indian Constitution, but if possible    (I recognisethat it may prove impossible) to postpone such consultation and details of machinery for it until a later stage,   and then to ensure that it was consultation with,  or consideration ofthe proposals of,  a manageable,  expert and competent body.As to this I imagine that you feel with me that there is nothing for it but to see what line the discussion takes*But I should like to confirm my own assumption that wecannot bind ourselves to accepting without qualificationwhatever (? recommendations)  (? ultimately) emerge out of a constituent Assembly or any similar body,  howeverrepresentative that body was.    A relevant consideration in

that connection seems to me. to be that  even if all parties in this Country were to he agreed (of which I see little prospect)  as to future constitutional arrangements,  Indiav/ould still for all that not be in a position to dictateterms to his Majesty.&apos;s Government.    General arrangementv/ould clearly be a factor of utmost significance and would carry the greatest weight with Parliament.    But even (? in)embryo it will bo- essential,  if India is to survive at allthat she should persuade His Majesty&apos;s Government to granther (whether by Treaty with a new Indian Central government or in whatever other way)&apos; some arrangement which will secureher defence.    (A satisfactory settlement of isstxo; of services,the debt,  commercial (? discrimination), would be less material from Indian point of view, and might indeed best admit ofbeing reached as part of quid pro quo for a defence under-standing.    If there was &quot;general agreementM ex hypothosi anarrangement satisfactory to all parties would have beenreached, of minorities question).Apart from that so long as we continue to have anyconnection with India it would be impossible for us as I see it to face the situation which would result if we hidcommitted our-selves to accepting without qualification the agreed recommendations of such a body and we found thatcertain of those recommendations were based on false premisesor had some inherent flaw of a serious character,  or in someother way would produce an unworkable situation which might indeed call for our re-entry to clear up and. for which weshould certainly have to take a portion of the blame.8. (c)    I would proceed on the basis both with Gandhi and.others that it is  axiomatic first that states would have to be essential elements in any unified India or in any dominion status, second that while full justice must be done to the

minorities, and adequate steps token to s-ifeguara. citjposition of sclieduled castes who  ire not strictly a minority(I await your views on my separate telegram of January 23rd,99-G on this subject),  equally we cannot accept the rightof any minority to hold up for ever all constitutional advance.I would nut at the same time propose to go too far in theearlier stages of the discussion in underlining that fact,though I can hint at it  to Jinnah, and hint equally to ghandi that that is  how one&apos;s general mind inclines. To givetoo explicit a guarantee at this stage would of course be toencourage Congress intransigence:    while the Moslem and otherminorities might read into any such explicit statementpossibilities far more disturbing thin we should welcome.9. As regards any expansion of my Executive Council in the interim period until we could get Federation going as steppingstone to Dominion Status at the earliest possible moment,  I regard it myself as essential that such expansion should be confined within limits which will give me a majority.    I would regard it as essential too that we should continue to i:eepthe Finance Membership in European hands. And finally, I taiceit that you share my view that expanded Council would have tocontinue to function as at present - in other words thatthere could be no question of accepting any convention underwhich it should be responsible to present central legislature or the like.10.        Let me only add that as I see it there can bo noquestion in the present conditions of an Irwin-Gandhi pact.The circustances    are entirely different,  and wo have to takethe minorities (especially the Moslems) and Princes with us.Nor will it surprise or disappoint me if forthcoming discussions are prolonged.    We shall probably be able to see

your way at all clearly only   after I have mad.-, contact with gandhi and can judge how his mind is moving.11. I would only say in conclusion that while I have putmy propositions and my ideas as to line to he taken in a somewhat precise form above,  that does not mean that I do not fully recognise that my handling of these matters with gandhi and others must at this stage be exploratory;    that I shallclearly also have to take the Moslems and Princes with me,which may not be too sv/ift or easy a business;  and that muchmust depend on Gandhi 1s reaction and on turn of our conversations.    On the other hard  as you will    appreciateI may find myself brought up without warning in my conversations with him against propositions involving issues of major policy on which I have touched above and I am naturally anxious inthese circumstances to know how much margin I have and thelimits (limits which I shall of course avoid approachingunless I am satisfied that I have no choice whatever) withinwhich I can operate.    My object will be to put the onus so faras I can on Gandhi;    and. so far as the minorities,   the scheduled castes and States are concerned,  to bring out to him that difficulties to which their existence gives rise have gottqbe faced by Indians  themselves if desired unified India and dominion Status are to be achieved.We must on the other hand while naturally taking everyprecaution to safeguard the points which are of interest tous or in respect of which we have under talc en obligations orresponsibilities, bear in mind, the importance,  consistently with that,  of assisting Gandhi to deal with pressure of hisown left.    I will, however,  I need not say, aim at keepingdiscussions as general as possible:  and if things reach an awkward stage,  or a   point at which clearly I must refer to you,

I would not anticipate any difficulty over delay with gandhi.    I ain I would repeat fully alive to the essentialnecessity of keeping in view the position of Moslems andother minorities and States and of avoiding any idea that weare trying to ccme to an arrangement with one party only.12. There may be other aspects, of this matter on v/hichBshall wish to consult you further.    But I think it well to let you have these preliminary comments,  general and provisional as they are, without delay.    I am not m-a&amp;ringthis telegram private, but I am giving it no distributionhere.
