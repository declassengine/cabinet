Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.SECRET. Copy No. j 3W.P. (G.) (40) 8.WAR CABINET.BROADCAST OE SHIPPING LOSSES.Note by the Eirst Lord of the Admiralty.I HAVE already circulated to the Cabinet (on the 20th December, 1939),W.P. (G.) (39) 160, a letter addressed by the Admiralty to the British broadcasting corporation, and a letter, with enclosures, from the Commander-in-Chief.Western Approaches, to the First Sea Lord.The Admiralty think it would be very much better that the losses of merchant ships-apart from anything very sensational should be announced by the B.B.C.weekly rather than nightly&apos;; and that at the same time a statement should bemade of the numbers of vessels or their tonnage which have safely entered or!cleared from British ports. It is not desired by the Admiralty at present to stop the daily publication of merchant shipping losses as they occur in the publicPress. This would be necessary if the figures became very serious, and it was.in fact, adopted in the late war; but in the present more fortunate circumstances it is not the publication of these losses in the newspapers, where they find theirproportionate place, which is injurious, but their ingemination by the B.B.C.from which we ask the Cabinet to relieve us.It would be opportune to take this step at a moment when losses are ata minimum rather than wait until perhaps they rise to dangerous or alarmingheights.W. S. C.January 11, 1940.[20606&quot;
