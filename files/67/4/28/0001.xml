Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.SECRET.W.P. (G.) (40) 28.WAR CABINET.ARRANGEMENTS FOR TRANSFER FROM THE MINISTRY OFSHIPPING TO THE ADMIRALTY OF THE RESPONSIBILITYFOR MERCHANT SHIPBUILDING AND REPAIRS.Copy No.  \\\Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE following is an outline of the arrangements which, after discussionwith the Ministry of Shipping, I propose to adopt on the transfer to theAdmiralty of the responsibility for merchant shipbuilding and repairs, inaccordance with the Cabinet decision of January 19.2. Sir James Lithgow has accepted my invitation to join the Board ofAdmiralty, as &quot; Controller of Merchant Shipbuilding.&apos;&apos; Admiral Eraser, the&quot;/Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy &quot; will retain his present functions,but will not be responsible for merchant shipbuilding, though, of course, he andSir James Lithgow will necessarily maintain the closest contact.3. The present Division of the Ministry of Shipping, which deals withmerchant shipbuilding and repairs, has as its Head a Director, Sir Amos Ayre.who is&quot; the Chairman of the Shipbuilding Conference and wTas lent by them to theMinify of Shipping for this purpose. I propose that Sir Amos and very nearly all the staff working under him at the Ministry (between 25 and 30 in number),should be transferred en bloc to the Admiralty in London. Sir Amos would be&quot; Director of Merchant Shipbuilding and Repairs&quot; under Sir James Lithgow.The special organisation which Sir Amos brings with him from the Ministry ofShipping will be joined to the existing Admiralty organisation. It is not neces-sary to describe in detail how exactly this will be done, but a few points may be mentioned. The technicians whom Sir Amos will bring with him will remain in aseparate Branch under him. The advice of the Director of Naval construction and of the other technical and professional departments of the Admiralty will, ofcourse, be available in any sphere in which it is desired, but the problems of the rapid building of merchant ships are so dissimilar from those of the building of warships that it would obviously be unwise to attempt to make thistechnical section in any way part of the department of the Director of naval construction.4. All priority questions in relation to labour and material will be dealtwith by the same Branch of the Admiralty that deals with such problems inrelation to the Navy. The Civil Servants who will come from the Ministry ofShipping will, generally speaking, become a separate Branch of the secretariat of the Admiralty working directly for Sir Amos Ayre&apos;s Department, but subjectto the Accounting Officer of the Admiralty as regards matters of finance, &amp;c.5. As regards area staff distributed over the country, it will be necessary,so far as repairs of merchant ships are concerned, to use the existing organisa-tion of Board of Trade surveyors. There should be no difficulty in arranging forthese officials to report direct to the Admiralty on matters falling within the sphere of that Department. For shipbuilding, it will undoubtedly be necessary to[20714]
Draft Announcement.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that the Admiralty shall become responsible for Merchant Shipbuilding and Repairs as from the 1st February,194(1.The arrangement is similar to that adopted in the latter part of the war of 1914-1918.It is sought to secure from this change in organization the advantages ofcentralising the use of all resources available for shipbuilding, both in materials and in labour, and of introducing great elasticity into the allotments of capacity to Naval and Mercantile requirements.The Minister of Shipping will continue to be responsible for advising, afterconsultation with representatives of Shipowners, upon the types of merchantvessels to be built, while the Admiralty will assume the responsibility for ensuring the necessary production of Mercantile Shipping, as well as that of meeting the requirements of the Navy.Sir James Lithgow will be aj^pointed to the Board of Admiralty asController of Merchant Shipbuilding and Repairs, and Sir Amos Ayre, who isat present Director of the Merchant Shipbuilding and Repairs Division of theMinistry of Shipping, will become Director of Merchant Shipbuilding and repairs at the Admiralty.build up an organisation of Area Progress Officers. The Ministry of Shipping-lias made a small start in tins direction. It will be necessary to collect togethermore officers.6\ It will probably be desirable to have a representative committee, whichwill give shipbuilders a convenient channel through which to express their views,but the constitution of this committee must await my further discussions with sir Maurice Denny. Sir James Lithgow and Sir Amos Ayre.7. This new side of the Admiralty will require reinforcement, and will grow as the production of merchant ships grows, and some of the arrangements which I have sketched above will, of course, require modification in the light of experience.8. A few legal points in connection with the transfer from the Ministry ofShipping to the Admiralty are still under investigation, ft is possible, though not yet certain, that some fresh Orders-in-Council will be necessary, but if thisproves to lie the case, they will be of a formal character and will present nodifficulty.9. T recommend that the transfer should take place on Thursday.February 1, and propose that before that date an announcement should lie madein the terms of the annexed draft.W. S. 0.January 28. 1940.
