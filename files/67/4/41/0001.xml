SECRET.W. P. (G)(40) . 41  .copy no. IlWAR CABIN ST.PUBLICATION OP NEWS  OP RESULTS OP AIR RAIDS.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for air and the Minister of Home Security.1.        We have reviewed the question how far it is desirable in the national interest to give publicity to the results of enemy air raids, with particular reference to civilian casualties2.        At the outbreak of war,  it was held to be practicable and desirable to maintain a high degree of secrecy in connectionwith air raids,  and the Defence Notices issued confidentially tothe Press were drafted on this assumption.3.        Experience has shown that, with a voluntary system of censorship,  extreme secrecy is not practicable.    Nor is it nowheld to be desirable,  the general view being that unlessdetailed information is issued promptly and authoritatively whensevere air raids take place,  there is the danger that rumourswill grow with such rapidity as to create grave public alarm.This danger is aggravated by the circumstances of evacuation.4.        We accept this view,  and consider that no news ofactual air raids or of civil casualties ought to be suppressedor delayed except in so far as this is vitally necessary on grounds of national security.  In some cases it may even bedesirable from a propaganda standpoint to give wide publicity toattacks on purely civil objectives..5.        The Defence Notices have accordingly been revised asthe result of discussions between the Departments concerned, the censorship-  and the Press, so as to allow a greater degree of/freedom to BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.

freedom, while maintaining the restrictions on the disclosure of information in regard to such matters as damage caused t*important objectives, number and types of British aircraftbrought down and bombs failing to explode.6.       Official bulletins will be issued from London by theAir Ministry and Ministry of Home Security in close co-operation as at present.    The governing principle will be to let thepublic know the permissible facts without delay as fast asthey become known with certainty and not to wait until the full account can be given.7.       The official notification of civil casualties will,we think, best be done locally, arrangements being made ineach locality to secure that lists of casualties (names andaddresses) admitted to hospitals, bodies taken to mortuaries,etc. , are made available at suitable centres to the public and to the Press.8.        There is bound to be an interval between the occurrence of an air raid in the provinces and the issue of anofficial statement from London.    The local demand for information will then be clamant and may be irresistible.    We propose that,during this interval,  a measure of discretion should be givento the Regional Officers of the Ministry of Information,  afterconsultation with their Regional Commissioners,  to furnishinformation locally and informally within limits now to beagreed between the Departments concerned.9.       It is not possible to lay down hard and fast rules asto the extent of the detailed information that may properly&quot;be given in the official bulletins or in material submitted for censorship by the Press cr in information given locally.This must depend on the circumstances of each case, but thefollowing points may be mentioned:-(i) The names of large towns bombed will normally begiven, unless there is a strong reason forwithholding the information from the enemy,/The

The publication of addresses of civil casualtieswill,  of course, indicate the locality where bwusshave been dropped,(ii)   In the case of sparsely populated areas, a general indication of location will usually suffice,(iii)   No information will be given, unless this becomesinevitable, as to damage caused to particularobjectives, e.g. Naval ports, but an exceptionwould probably be made in the case of large buildings not of military importance, such as a*of our great cathedrals,(iv)   Some approximate estimate or indication of the extentof civilian casualties would be given as soon aspossible, but in the case of very serious lossesthis disclosure might have to be by stages.10.      Before making final arrangements on these lir.es, we wish to Tse assured that our po-posals have the approval oftine Cabinet.K. W.J. A.7th February,  1940.
