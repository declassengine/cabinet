Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.SECRET. Copy No.  iW.P. (G.) (40) 15.WAR CABINET.UTILISATION OF THE MAN-POWER RESOURCES OF THE colonial empire.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.AT its meeting on the 16th October, 1939, the War Cabinet asked that areport should be prepared by the Colonial Office, in conjunction with the WarOffice, on the question of how the man-power resources of the Colonial Empirecould best be utilised during the war (Cabinet 53 (39). Minute 3). The question has been the subject of lengthy examination and discussion between the WarOffice, the Colonial Office and the Colonial Governments. The following memo-randum has been seen by the Secretary of State for War, who is in agreementwith it.2. The problem is a complicated one. There are a very large number of colonial Dependencies, and they differ widely in their geographical situations,their racial compositions, their economic structures and their forms ofgovernment. It is inevitable that a review of their man-power resources shouldlargely take the form of a detailed examination of the situation in each importantDependency or group of Dependencies. There are, however, certain generalfactors which affect, the problem in all the Dependencies, and, in particular,there are certain general factors which differentiate the problem to-day from thatwhich obtained in the early part of the war of 1914-18.3. In the first place the military forces raised in the Colonial Dependencieswere more numerous and better equipped in September 1939 than in August1914. In view of the difficult international situation during recent years, it has been necessary to be prepared for the possibility of Avar in Europe, war in africa and war in the Far East. Much thought was given to planning the contributionto our military effort which the Colonial Dependencies could give in such eireum-stances. Local military forces were increased in strength, and local R.N.V.R.forces were formed in a number of places. Some striking cases of the increasedcall which these preparations had made on local man power are those of EastAfrica, where the numbers of men in the local forces in September 1939 were approximately 11,100 as compared with 4,700 in August 1914; of Trinidad, wherethey were 1,490 as compared with 260; of Hong Kong, where 1,450 were enrolledas compared with 520; and of Malaya, where the figure was 10,220 as comparedwith 3,400. In a number of the smaller colonies local defence forces had beenestablished where formerly none existed.4. There are other major differences, affecting the colonies, between the last war and this. In the Far East in the war of 1914-18 Japan was an ally and therewas no naval base at Singapore. There was no anxiety as regards the defence of hong Kong, and it was possible for Malaya, after providing for local defence and essential local industries, to release a substantial number of men (seeparagraph 15) for service with the imperial forces overseas. So far as can at[20674] b
present lie foreseen, however, it will be essential to maintain throughout thewar strong defence forces both at Singapore and at Hong Kong, and the factthat the local forces form an integral part of the garrisons means that defence requirements inevitably absorb a very high proportion of the available man-power(particularly European man-power) of military age.5. In Africa in 1914-18 the first duty of the West and East AfricanDependencies was to assist in the conquest of the German colonies in Africa.All the African troops that they could raise were fully employed in the west and East African campaigns. In the present emergency preparations have beenmade in the African Dependencies for a similar war effort against the possibilityof Italian intervention, but. if that possibility finally disappears, a new problem will emerge as to the best use which can be made of the forces which havebeen raised.6. The economic development of the Colonial Dependencies since 1914-18has made the maintenance of their civil services and of their productive industries of greater importance than in the last war. On the analogy of the arrangementsmade in this country. Colonial Governments have been warned that men occupyingkey positions in the Colonial civil service and in essential industries should notbe released for military service overseas. Some measure of dilution in this mattermay be possible, for example, the recall of retired Colonial civil servants to takethe place of younger men. and the proportion of Europeans to Chinese andIndians in rubber&quot;estates and tin mines in Malaya may be reduced; but theessential industries in the Colonies cover a wide field, such as rubber and tin in malaya, copper in Northern Rhodesia, sugar in Mauritius, Fiji and the west indian Colonies, mineral oil in Trinidad, oilseeds and nuts and vegetable oils,tin. gold and manganese in West Africa.7. But the cardinal consideration which must govern the utilisation of colonial man-power for military purposes is that, so far as newr combatantformations are concerned, our ability to provide equipment is the limiting factor in our war effort, not our ability to provide man-power. For at least the nexttwro years the raising of new combatant units in the Colonial Dependencies willnot on strict military merits be practicable, because all the available supplies of equipment will be required for units considered to be of superior fighting quality,raised in this country or the Dominions. The proportionately greater amount of equipment required in a modern force as compared with that required in 1914renders this particular limitation much greater than it was in the early part ofthe last war. Even if. after the first two years of war additional supplies of equipment become available, and it is possible to explore the utilisation of freshsources of man-power for the formation of combatant units, it is probable thatthe fighting races of India would be drawn upon rather than any of the racesinhabiting the Colonial Dependencies.8. It may be suggested that combatant units might be used in replacement of British regular troops stationed in certain garrisons abroad. But in our overseas garrisons the process of dilution has, save in a few cases referred to inthis memorandum, already been carried out to the maximum extent held to be compatible with security. Furthermore, political considerations limit the extentto which forces raised in the Colonies could be employed in this manner. Thus,to take only one instance, the employment of African troops as part of thegarrison in Egypt (at any rate in areas near to Cairo) or in Palestine, in substitu-tion for British regular troops, would be open to political objections which wouldprobably be insuperable. Moreover, the great majority of regular British unitsnow stationed in such garrisons are on a lower standard of equipment than isrequired for major operations. If these units were relieved by newly-formedunits of native personnel, the new units would require the same equipment that isnow held by the regular British units. Consequently, the relief of the regularBritish units would only result in providing us with additional fully trained personnel, and would not improve the equipment situation. The process,moreover, would take a long time. Consequently, it has been decided that our policy should be to &quot; milk &quot; the existing regular units in overseas garrisons ratherthan to replace them by new units. Drafts of partially trained personnel arebeing sent out and absorbed by the British regular units&quot;, which are then able to liberate drafts of trained personnel, which are brought back to the United
Kingdom. By this process we shall in due course withdraw the great or propor-tion of the experienced British officers, N.C.Os. and other ranks now in overseasgarrisons. Consequently, the replacement of British regular units b\ newly-raised units of native personnel is not advocated.9. A further limitation on the employment of combatant forces from theColonial Dependencies (especially from Africa) is that the only theatre of operations at present is France. In the war of 1914-18 the African and MiddleFast theatres provided suitable areas for the employment of combatant units from our tropical Dependencies. Apart from the Chinese labour corps. Colonialnative units were in the main not employed in France; and, in general, employ-men t there of such units is. apart from other considerations, undesirable onclimatic grounds. There is. however, a possibility of forming in East Africa a division of African troops, drawn from West as well as East Africa, which, if circumstances require, would be sent to the Middle East for service in suitableareas. e.g., Iraq and Southern Iran. This proposal is dealt with in paragraph 48below.10. In view of these considerations, it may be suggested that the man-powerof the Colonies should be further drawn upon exclusively for pioneer units. Thereis a large demand for such units and it is not clear at present how far the labour required can be found from the United Kingdom. Many Colonies can provideexcellent material for pioneer work. The detailed review which follows showsthat a number of such units can be raised. But in certain areas it will be desirableto avoid giving the impression that the inhabitants of the Colonies are looked upon as being fit only for labour duties, and this is an argument for expandingexisting combatant units or. in some cases, creating new ones when the equipmentsituation allows.11. Colonial man-power may also be utilized by its direct entry into theImperial forces. Broadly speaking, the number of men in the Colonies suitablefor, and desirous of entry into, the Royal Navy is very limited, and in any event,the man-power requirements of the Royal Navy for general service, except in afew specialist ratings such as artificers, are small in comparison with the largenumbers of suitable men who wish to join. In some of the Colonies, e.g.. HongKong and Malaya, there are important R.N.V. Reserves which form an essential part of the local defence forces. As regards the Army, Colonial governments have been informed that, while the immediate need is for skilled tradesmen incertain categories, there are also openings for suitable volunteers who come tothis country from the Colonies to enlist. But although it has been ruled thatfor the period of the present emergency coloured British subjects in this country are to be on the same footing as British subjects of pure European descent asregards the grant of emergency commissions and entry into the armed forces, forobvious reasons it is not desired to encourage coloured British subjects to cometo this country for direct enlistment in the Imperial forces. The difficulty ofaccording different treatment to white and coloured volunteers in the same Colonywill be readily appreciated. It is hoped to meet this difficulty to some extent by providing openings for coloured persons in locally raised units. As regardsEuropeans who can be spared from the Colonies, direct enlistment into theImperial forces is considered preferable to their enrolment in locally raised whiteunits for service overseas owing to difficulties as regards the equipment andmaintenance of such units. In addition to arrangements for the enlistment ofEuropean volunteers from the Colonies who may come to this country, plans arebeing considered to facilitate the enlistment of men who can be spared inappropriate oversea commands. Such volunteers will provide valuable materialas potential officers, and their training will be directed to this end. As regardsthe Royal Air Force, all Colonial Governments have been informed that thereare immediate openings for skilled tradesmen in certain categories. There will certainly, however, be also numerous applications from non-technical personnelwho will wish to come from the Colonies to join the R.A.F. as pilots, observersand the like. There is undoubtedly material in the Colonies very suitable fortraining for the R.A.F. The general question, therefore, arises as to the provisionof facilities for such training in the Colonies themselves. There are flving clubsin a number of the Colonies e.g., in Malaya, Ceylon, East Africa and Trinidad;and before the outbreak of war schemes for establishing R.A.F. Volunteer Reserve[20674] b 2
centres for training pilots and skilled technicians were being planned in Malaya,Kenya. Malta and West Africa. A scheme was also under consideration for theestablishment of an auxiliary air unit in Ceylon. In recent weeks a comprehensive scheme has been adopted whereby elementary training of pilots in each Dominionwill be followed by advanced training in Canada. The question of the part whichpersonnel from the Colonies can play in that scheme has been raised with theAir Ministry, but no decision has been reached. It must be recognised, however,that here again the problem of the treatment to be accorded to coloured applicantswill be a serious one.12. The following paragraphs give a review for each Dependency or group of Dependencies of the demands on local man-power and the plans for itsutilisation : Hong Kong.13. In 1914-18 a Chinese contingent was recruited in Hong Kong for service in Mesopotamia and in addition approximately 500 Europeans of military agecame to this country to enlist. No such exodus will be possible in presentcircumstances. The local volunteer forces, including the R.N.V.R., form anessential part of the garrison and to ensure their maintenance and adequatestrength and efficiency (particularly as regards European personnel) a compulsory service Ordinance was enacted immediately before the war. Of the 1.700European British subjects of military age, approximately 760 were members ofthe local volunteer forces before the enactment of the Compulsory ServiceOrdinance, 500 have been subsequently enrolled for service under its provisions,while the remainder either occupy essential posts or are unfit for service. TheGovernor has stated that at the present all available Europeans must be retained in the Colony for local needs: if later a small number can be spared they will be valuable material for officers and N.C.Os. in Chinese labour units.14. It is not possible to contemplate the replacement of one of the whitebattalions in the Hong Kong garrison by a locally raised non-European unit.It follows that Hong Kong non-European man-power can be best utilised inChinese labour units for service overseas, including France. Any such unitsraised in Hong Kong would draw Chinese volunteers from the mainland ofChina, and the Governor has reported that, provided that no difficulties arisevis-a-vis the Chinese and Japanese Governments (on which point we are in touchwith our Ambassadors in Shanghai and Tokyo), the numbers likely to be availableare practically unlimited. The War Office are now considering plans for raisingsuch units. The Governor has indicated that recruitment could begin at once and that men should be obtained at the rate of 500 a week. He is being asked if that rate could be increased since the plan under consideration is to raise 50,000men from this source in 1940.Malaya.15, In the early part of the war of 1914-18 the local forces in Malaya wereexpanded from a strength of approximately 3,400 officers and men to a strengthof approximately 4,500 officers and men. The requirements of local defence and the necessity for maintaining essential industries precluded the despatchof any large contingents from Malaya for overseas service, but the Malay StatesGuides were employed in Aden from 1915 onwards, a number of Eurasiansand Asiatics joined an Anglo-Indian battalion which saw service on the North -West Frontier of India, and approximately 1,000 Europeans enlisted (as individuals) into the Imperial forces. In the present war the essential require-ments of local defence and of local industries (especially the tin mines andrubber estates) make demands on local man-power to an extent much greaterthan in 1914-18. As in Hong Kong, the local defence forces, including theR.N.V.R. and Malayan unit of the Royal Navy, form an essential part of thegarrison charged with the defence of Singapore, and it is vital that they shouldbe kept up to strength. In order that this may be effected, the Governor hasbeen given authority to enact legislation imposing on British subjects and british protected persons in the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay Statesliability for compulsory combatant service with the local forces. This legislation is only&apos;being applied in practice to European British subjects of military age,
in order to bring several units up to the required establishment. The degree to which the requirements of local defence and local industries absorb the availableEuropean man-power is illustrated hy the following figures. It is estimated that(excluding Singapore, in respect of which figures are not immediately available),approximately 1,700 Europeans are members of local defence forces, nearly1,800 are required for essential posts in the Government Service and localindustries, and only approximately 360 men of military age fall outside these categories. Actually, however, out of the 1,700 men who are members of thelocal forces it has been found necessary to exempt 450 from mobilization foractive service as being holders of essential posts. The conclusion is. therefore,that while it is necessary to maintain the present European strength in the local forces, no Europeans can be spared for service overseas. Such figures as areavailable for Singapore indicate that the position is similar there. broadly speaking, therefore, so far as European man-power is concerned, it will be inthe best interests of the Empire for the men to remain available for local needs in defence and in the maintenance of essential production and trade.16. Similarly, the whole of the local Chinese and Indian man-power isrequired for labour on tin mines, rubber estates and other industries.Consequently, it will not be possible to raise any pioneer units from among theChinese in Malaya.17. There remain the Malays. In recent years a Malay Regiment has been raised at the expense of the Federated Malay States. This has now passed the experimental stage, has been declared fit for war and forms part of the garrisonAvhich would defend Singapore in the event of attack. Since the outbreak of wararrangements have been made, with the enthusiastic concurrence of the Sultans,to raise an additional company of this Regiment. If necessary, it could he stillfurther expanded, but in view of the difficulties as regards equipping and trainingany new combatant units, this course is not recommended. Malays would not hesuitable for service in pioneer units.Ceylon.18. During the war of 1914-18 a European contingent (a double company of infantry) was sent to France from Ceylon and was attached to a battalion ofthe New Zealand Expeditionary Force, while numbers of Europeans andCeylonese came to this country to enlist. In all approximately 1.500 europeans and 600 Ceylonese served with the combatant forces overseas. In addition, aCeylonese Sanitary Company (100 strong) served in Mesopotamia, whileapproximately 1,200 Ceylonese were employed with water transport services inMesopotamia and East Africa.19. During recent years the strengthening of the defences of Colombo andTrincomalee have involved additional calls on the local volunteer forces, includingthe R.N.V.R. organisation, which now number nearly 3,500 men. Thus a new7Anti-Aircraft regiment of the Ceylon Defence Force is in course of formation toprovide personnel for the Anti-Aircraft defences of Colombo. In addition,authority has been given for the recruitment of 400 Ceylonese into the RegularArmy for service with the heavy artillery at Trincomalee.20. Suitable Europeans in Ceylon are being encouraged to enrol in theOfficers&apos; Emergency Reserve, and will be available for service outside Ceylon when required. In addition, it is probable that a number of Europeans can be sparedfor enlistment into the Imperial forces. These will fall within the scope of thegeneral arrangements made for the enlistment of volunteers from the Colonies.21. In general, the Governor has emphasised the importance of safeguarding the requirements of local industries (e.g., rubber and tea) and has recommendedthat the best way of utilizing any surplus man-power will be to expand further the local forces. The formation of a local labour unit for service overseas isconsidered impracticable in view of the difficulty of finding suitable personnel.Mauritius.22. During the war of 1914-18 a volunteer force was established whichafter training enabled the regular garrison on the island to be released for serviceelsewhere.   In addition approximately 500 Mauritians joined the British or
French armies, while over 1,500 men were recruited for a labour battalion whichwas employed in Mesopotamia.23. The local defence force (approximately 200 strong) was mobilized atthe beginning of the war; and the Governor proposes, with the concurrence ofthe Oversea Defence Committee, that it should be trained to replace the smallregular garrison on the island. In addition, proposals have been submitted tothe War Office for the formation of a pioneer unit from Mauritius. The-Governorestimates that a unit 1.000 strong could be formed without difficulty within one month or six weeks from the receipt of the necessary authority. This would be acoloured unit (apart from officers) and would contain a number of skilled men(lorry drivers, mechanics, blacksmiths, &amp;o), some of whom could, if required, be diverted after their arrival in the theatre of war from the pioneer unit for employment at their own trades.24. It is probable that a number of individual Mauritians of Europeandescent will wish to enlist directly into the British or French forces; but for the island generally the replacement of the regular garrison by the local volunteerforce and the raising of the proposed pioneer unit represent the best use that canbe made of the man-power available.Seychelles.25. In 1914--18 approximately 100 Seyehellois served with the British andFrench forces. In addition, a labour unit nearly 800 strong was recruited at theend of 1916 for service in East Africa.26. The Acting Governor has reported that, apart from a few individuals who will wash to enlist direct into the British or French forces, the most suitable form of service for the inhabitants of the Colony would be in a pioneer unit. Hewill be able to recruit without difficulty up to 500 men for such a unit, and proposals for the formation of such a force have been submitted to the WarOtlice. The Acting Governor considers, however, that it would be most unwise to send this unit to France until the spring.Fiji.27. During the war of 1914-18 uumerous Europeans from Fiji enlisteddirectly into the United Kingdom, the Australian and the New Zealand forces.In addition a European contingent numbering approximately 250 was sent fromthe Colony to France, while in 1917 a small labour unit (100 strong) also servedthere.   In all nearly 800 men left Fiji for service overseas.28. The changed position in the Far East has necessitated increased attentionto the local defences of the Colony, and. as a result of the recommendationsof the Pacific Defence Conference this year, it has been decided to expand thedefence force which did not exist in 1914 by the addition of two Europeancompanies, and to raise in addition a force of approximately 2 officers and100 men to man fixed defences which are now being installed at Suva. this expansion of the local forces is proceeding, and it is felt that until it has beencompleted, and the local defence position can be regarded as more secure thanat present, there should be no question of. encouraging men to leave Fiji forcombatant service overseas.29. The Governor has reported that it would be possible to raise without difficulty a Fijian pioneer unit. Proposals for the formation of such a unitare now being examined in the War Office.30. The islands falling under the jurisdiction of the High Commissionerfor the Western Pacific are, in general, sparsely inhabited, and the localpopulations are not suitable for service overseas. One or two of the islandsmaintain small local defence forces.A den.31. Aden was a theatre of war in 1914-18 since the neighbouringProtectorate territory was occupied by the Turks. Consequently any localman-]lower available was absorbed by the requirements of local defence.
The number of Europeans of military age in Aden is insignificant, and tlheyare engaged almost entirely in the public services or in connection with theport. &quot;The local labour supply is fully engaged on a programme of urgentdefence works and would, in any case, be unsuitable for pioneer work in Europe.There are no Europeans in the Aden Protectorate except the few in government service and the local Arab tribesmen would be unsuitable for service overseas.Palestine and Trans-Jordan.32. The question whether Palestinian units (mixed Arab and Jew) shouldbe raised for military service is being dealt with in a separate memorandum tothe War Cabinet. The general line taken in this memorandum is that : (i) suchunits could not be relied upon to maintain internal security in place of theexisting British garrison; (ii) the direct enlistment of Palestinians (Jews and arabs)&apos; into certain regular units of the British army now serving in Palestine(e.g., Royal Engineers. Royal Army Ordnance Corps, &amp;e.) should be continued;(iii) Palestinians up to a maximum of 350 should be enlisted as part of the forceof 700 men required to man the coastal and Anti-Aircraft defences at Haifa;(iv) the raising of Palestinian pioneer units as part of the Auxiliary MilitaryPioneer Corps should be continued: (v) combatant Palestinian units, for serviceoutside Palestine, should not be raised, but this decision may be reconsideredat a later date when the subject of equipment is no longer a determining factor.33. If the above policy is accepted, efforts will be concentrated for thepresent on: (a) The direct enlistment of Palestinians into regular British units in Palestine, to complete establishments and provide personnel for ancillary services, such as motor drivers : some 1.000 men are being recruited in this way.(b) The raising of pioneer units, recruitment for which has already started. TheGeneral Officer Commanding hopes to be able to recruit 4,000 men for them : thefirst two companies should be ready to leave Palestine at the beginning ofFebruary, (c) The enlistment of Palestinians into the unit required to man the anti-Aircraft and coast defences at Haifa, (d) The maintenance to the requiredstrength of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force and the Arab Legion.Cyprus.34. No combatant unit was raised in Cyprus in 1914-18, but some 12,000muleteers were recruited for service chiefly in Gallipoli and Salonika.35. Before the outbreak of war it had been decided to begin recruitment for the regular army in Cyprus, and authority was given in August to enlist500 men for service in the R.A.S.C. These men are being sent in regular draftsto Egypt after preliminary training in Cyprus; it is expected that all will havearrived in Egypt by the end of January. In addition, authority was given inNovember for the immediate enlistment of 476 muleteers for service in France,and these men have now arrived in Frame.36. Proposals for a more extended enlistment of Cypriots are at present under examination by the War Office. Briefly, these proposals, to whichimmediate effect could be given, comprise the raising, in the first instance, of aCyprus regiment. The regiment would consist of a combatant battalion designed,in the first place, for guard duties (protecting aerodromes, storage&apos;es. prisoners ofwar and the like) in Egypt, with one company permanently in Cyprus for local defence duties, and of a number of Pioneer and Transport (Muleteer) units whichcan be employed in France. The Governor has urged strongly that it is of thefirst importance from a local standpoint to make all the units raised in Cyprusparts of a Cyprus regiment, and to provide officers and N.C.Os. as far as possible from Cyprus itself; but it is considered that a proportion of both must be Britishfor some time to come.37. It is not proposed at present to raise more than one combatant unit, buta number of Pioneer and Transport units can be raised without difficulty, andit can be assumed that Cyprus could produce, if required, numbers of men verysuitable for labour units in excess of the total (12,000) recruited in 1914-18.
Malta.38. In all some 31,000 Maltese served with the armed forces and in thelocal naval establishments in 1914-18. Local defence units were expanded tonumber some 4,500 men, while 7,000 men were recruited into a Maltese LabourCorps.39. In the last two years the general increases approved in defence disposi-tions at Malta have involved an increase in the strength of the two Maltese unitson the island viz., the Royal Malta Artillery and the King&apos;s Own MaltaRegiment. These now comprise some 2.30(1 men. In addition, a Malta territorial force is now being raised (with an establishment of 750 men) to assist in the manning of the A.A. defences of the island. Proposals for the formation of aPioneer unit for service in France have been considered by the War Office, but have been dropped for the present as agreement could not be reached on the termsof service.40. Large numbers of Maltese are employed on the naval establishmentson the island. Approximately 10.000 men are at present employed in the dock-yard, while it is estimated that another 1.200 are serving in other navalestablishments or with the Mediterranean Fleet. In addition, some 1.100 men areemployed in R.A.F. establishments. It may be added that the extensive pro-gramme of constructing shelters against air attack and other passive defence measures arc necessarily absorbing considerable numbers of Maltese.Gibraltar.41. In 1914-18 a total of 2,350 men from Gibraltar were employed in thenaval dockyards, a small volunteer force was raised for local service, and 76 menenlisted in the army.42. It was decided shortly before the present war to raise a local volunteerforce in Gibraltar to augment the garrison, particularly to man certain additionalA.A. defences. This force is being raised and now numbers over 200 men. Themost important use for such limited man-power as is available in Gibraltar isemployment in the naval establishments, where approximately 1,600 men areemployed at present.East and West Africa.43. Large forces were raised in the East African Dependencies during thewar of 1914-18 for the campaign against German East Africa. Thus, thenumbers of the King&apos;s African Rifles rose from a pre-war figure of 62 british officers, 2 British NCOs. and 2,319 Africans to a peak figure (in July 1918) of1,193 British Officers, 1.497 British N.C.Os. and 30,658 Africans. In&apos; addition,over 200.000 Africans were recruited as carriers. (Large numbers of the british officers and N.C.Os. were drawn from areas outside East Africa.)44. An expansion of the Royal West African Frontier Force also took place during 1914-18 in order to provide troops for the East and West Africancampaigns. In all. numbers rose from approximately 360 British Officers and in-COs^ and 7.200 Africans to 2.040 British Officers and N.C.Os. and 24.870Africans.45. On the outbreak of the present war it was decided, owing to thepossibility of war with Italy, that effect must be given to the plans approved inpeace time for a considerable expansion of the military forces available in EastAfrica and for a corresponding expansion in West Africa in order to providereinforcements for East Africa. In East Africa the Northern and SouthernBrigades, K.A.R., with a pre-war strength of three rifle (full) battalions andthree (Cadre) battalions, have all been mobilised at war establishment, involving an increase of nearly 100 per cent, in the case of the cadre battalions. Inaddition, another battalion has been raised and is approaching war establishment;the Supply and Transport Corps has been greatly expanded; the KenyaTerritorial Regiment and part of the Kenya Defence Force have been mobilised;and a number of additional ancillary units (signal, survey, ambulance, &amp;c.) havebeen formed. The general result has been to increase the number of Africansserving with the local forces from approximately 4,600 (excluding reserves) to13,100.   There has been a corresponding increase in the number of Europeans.
Approximately 2,,000 Europeans are at present serving with the forces. Inaddition, there is the Kenya Defence Force of approximately 5,000 Europeans,large numbers of whom cannot, however, be regarded as available for duty outsideEast Africa. Many are over military age and are engaged in essentialoccupations.46. In the R.W.A.F.F. the five rifle and three cadre battalions which existed before the war have expanded to war establishment; an additional battalion hasbeen raised; and personnel have been recruited for ancillary transport, survey and medical units. The effect has been to increase the number of Africans serving with the forces from approximately 5.900 (excluding reserves) to 10,00Q. Thenumber of Europeans has been increased correspondingly; over 1.000 are now serving.47. It had been contemplated that further battalions would lie raised in both East and West Africa, but in view of our improved relations with Italyit has been decided to postpone any such action.48. Thus, the position is that in the R.W.A.F.F. and the K.A.R. we havefive infantry brigades and some units of other arms of good Colonial troops which are already equipped. This scale of equipment is not up to Westernstandards, nor is it yet at a standard desirable for secondary theatres. It hasbeen agreed in principle that East African and West African forces could be concentrated in East Africa to form a Colonial Division there, and arrangements have been made for this concentration, should it be decided upon. The WarCabinet have, however, decided that the plan should be held in suspense for thepresent. So long as it is necessary to provide against the possibility of Italianhostility, the bulk of this Division would have to remain in East Africa. If,however, Italian neutrality were assured, the Division would constitute a valuablereserve for employment in the Middle East. These African troops could not be relied upon in action against German forces, nor could they be relied upon to fightwell in a cold wet climate to which they are entirely unaccustomed. It is contem-plated, however, that they may be usefully employed in certain Middle Easternareas. e.g., Iraq or Southern Iran, but whether there will be any call for theiractual employment in these areas must remain uncertain. In view of thisuncertainty, the limitations on their employment elsewhere, and the majordifficulty of equipment, the raising of new combatant units in Africa at present is not recommended. In short, the only call on African man-power for combatantunits will be to maintain in being (either in East and West Africa, as at present,or else concentrated in East Africa) the Division mentioned above, in additionto small local garrisons for internal security purposes. The principal ports in both East and West Africa also maintain small R.K.V.R. units employed in local defence.49. It is probable that once it is possible to relax defence precautions against Italy numbers of Europeans would be available from East Africa for service overseas, despite the necessity for maintaining adequate European cadresof officers and N.C.Os. for the African troops. These men would be encouraged to enlist direct into the Imperial forces. If necessary, the officers&apos; training unitalready established at Kampala could be used for the preliminary training ofthose suitable for subsequent appointment as officers.50. There remains the possibility of raising native pioneer units in Eastand West Africa for employment in France or, should the occasion arise, inthe Middle East. So far as East Africa is concerned, quite apart from the strain which will be thrown on local man-power resources by maintaining food supplies and ancillary services for the forces which may be stationed there, the recruitment of natives for service in the pioneer units for France must be ruled out on climatic grounds. Objections on climatic grounds would not, how-ever, apply to their employment in certain areas in the Middle East, and, infact, if African combatant troops were employed in those areas and pioneerunits were needed there, such units might suitably be drawn from East Africa.As regards West Africa, the objections on medical grounds to service in Franceare very strong, but if it proves impossible to raise sufficient pioneer units from other sources it may be necessary to test whether a labour force drawn from West Africa could give satisfactory service in France.  Major G. St. J. Orde[20674] c
Bl &quot;owne, Labour Adviser to the Colonial Office, is exploring the position withthe West African Governors in the course of his present visit to West Africa.West Indies.51. During the war of 1914-18, the man-power contribution from the west indies fell into three categories :  (a) The West India Regiment : this was a regular uuit existing before thewar, which saw service in East and West Africa.(&amp;) The British West Indies Regiment: this corps was established in theautumn of 1915.     Eleven battalions were raised, the total strengthbeing as follows : &amp; other officers. ranks.Barbados    ............ 20               811Bahamas    ............ 2               -WJBritish Guiana     ......... 14               08bBritish Honduras......... 5               52bJamaica     ............ 303 9,977Trinidad and Tobago    ...... 40 1,438Grenada     ............ 4               441St. Lucia............ 5               354St. Vincent............... fThe Leeward Islands     ......397 15,204The rank and hie were composed almost entirely of coloured WestIndians : the officers were mainly of European descent.(c) Direct enlistments into the Imperial forces : It is known that contingentsof 260 Europeans from Trinidad and 80 from Barbados were sent over for enlistment : in addition a considerable number of men came overindependently from the other West Indian Colonies.52. Reports received from the Governors of these Colonies at the beginningof the war indicated that they were receiving numerous offers of service frompeople of all classes. Emphasis was laid on the fact that it would be necessary toprovide outlets for service so that the local inhabitants could be assured that their assistance in the prosecution of the war was valued.53. Some of the local man-power available will be most usefully employedon the maintenance of essential industries (sugar production, oil in Trinidad,bauxite in British Guiana), and on the expansion of food production so as toreduce the dependence of the Colonies on outside sources. In addition, local defence forces have been brought up to strength. The approximate number of menat present serving in all the local forces is 4,850. Where required, these forces are in course of expansion. Thus in Trinidad the strength is being increased from approximately 1,500 to 2,000, and a R.N.V.R. force has been raised for local defence; while in Bermuda the Militia Artillery is being expanded to include asmall infantry branch and a service force of approximately 200 men has been raised. There will remain, however, a large surplus of man-power (mainlycoloured), available for oversea service, if required.54. So far as this surplus consists of persons of pure European descent, itwill be possible, as in 1914-18. for a considerable number to come to this country,as and when required, for direct individual enlistment with the forces. Directenlistment into the forces here cannot, however, provide the main outlet forWest Indian man-power, in view of the undesirability of encouraging a largeflow of coloured applicants. It is therefore necessary to consider the raising of units in the West Indian Colonies themselves.55. Although there is reason to believe that certain sections of the people would feel aggrieved if it were decided that West Indians should be recruitedfor pioneer units only, the raising of any large combatant units in the west indies for service overseas is out of the question for at least the next two yearsbecause of the difficulties of equipment. Apart from these difficulties, such units would be of doubtful military value for combatant service overseas, especially
against German troops in Europe. Broadly speaking, it may be said that in thelast war the battalions of the British West Indies Regiment were found to bemore useful as pioneer units than as combatant troops. Consideration has,however, been given to the possibility that a combatant unit might be raised toreplace in due course the white battalion at present stationed in Jamaica andBermuda. A proposal to this end has been submitted by the Governor of Jamaica,who suggested that the first step should be to raise the Jamaica Infantry Volun-teers from a present strength of 256 to a total of 900. Hitherto it has beenaccepted that the retention of a white battalion in the West Indies was essentialnot only on strategic grounds, but also for reasons of internal security. Thequestion whether, during the present emergency, the while battalion could be withdrawn and its place taken by a locally raised force has been reviewed by the oversea Defence Committee. It would, however, be necessary to raise acomparatively large force to replace the white battalion, and the conclusion wasreached that the proposal should not be proceeded with on financial grounds,especially as it will be possible to withdraw trained men from the white battalionby the &quot; milking &quot; arrangement described in paragraph 7. For political reasons,however, it may be necessary in order to satisfy local amour-propre-to raise asmall combatant unit in the West Indies for service there or over^seas. This isunder consideration.56. It is clear that the best use which can be made of West Indian man-power is by the raising of pioneer units for which there is much suitable material.The U.S.A. authorities enquired in the early autumn as to the number of west indian labourers who might be available after June 1940 for work in thePanama Canal Zone (but the date has been advanced, and arrangements arebeing made for the immediate recruitment of a first contingent of 1,000 fromJamaica). The Governors estimated that the following numbers would beavailable : Jamaica        ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       15,000Barbados      ...............      10.000Windward Islands............        8,000Leeward Islands     ...       .........        8,000British Guiana       ............        3.000Trinidad        ...      ............      1.000British Honduras    ............        1.000Service in Panama is particularly popular in the West Indies on account of thegood conditions and high rates of pay obtaining there. For this reason, and because a higher standard of medical fitness would be required for pioneer service in France, it is unlikely that comparable numbers of suitable recruits could beobtained, on a voluntary basis, for pioneer units. The Governors have, however,reported that (whatever decision is taken as regards the raising of a combatantunit for local service) it will be possible to raise units as part of a general west indian pioneer force. The numbers of men recruited will depend on the medicalstandard required, on the conditions of service offered, and whether or not acombatant force is to be raised. For these reasons it has not been possible to formany firm estimate of the numbers available from each Colony, but it may beassumed, on a conservative basis, that at least 5,000 men of good physique couldbe obtained at once, in addition to a small separate unit of 400-600 men fromBermuda, This proposal for the raising of pioneer units in the West Indies isunder examination. One warning is, however, necessary. Some doubt has been expressed as to whether it would be advisable to employ West Indian units ina cold climate, owing to their special susceptibility to lung diseases. This neednot, however, be regarded as an insuperable bar to their employment in France,provided that an adequate medical service (including doctors Avith special experience of lung diseases) is made available.St. Helena and Ascension: Falklands.,57. These small Colonies are necessarily preoccupied with local defence.In St. Helena a local defence force of approximately 100 strong has been raised,and. it is hoped that after training it may be possible for this force to takeover some of the duties of the regular reinforcements sent to St. Helena atthe beginning of the war and so release at least a portion of that force for service elsewhere.   In Ascension a small local defence force is to be raised from
Colonial Office. January 22. 1940.among the employees of Cable and Wireless Limited. In the Falkland Islandsthe defence force (approximately 285 strong) has been mobilised for duty. Fora period in October and November it was found necessary to reinforce it by asmall party of ex-service men drawn from South America. Although thesereinforcements have now returned to South America the local force will be very fully occupied especially as it is probable that the fixed defences of the islandwill be strengthened in the near future. In South Georgia a small local force isbeing raised from the employees of Messrs. Salvesen and Company, to man fixeddefences which are being installed in Leith Harbour.Summary of Conclusions.58. (a) The first call on the man-power of the Colonies should be for local defence and for the maintenance of their civil services and their essential industries. In some, e.g., Hong Kong and Malaya, this will absorb practically all the man-power available.(b) The next call should be for pioneer units, for which there is valuablematerial available in the Colonies. Schemes are under examination by theColonial Office and the War Office for Chinese pioneer units based on Hong Kong;but drawing recruits mainly from available areas in China, and for pioneer units from the West Indies. Mauritius, Seychelles. Fiji and the Mediterranean area.The extent to which these Schemes can and should he implemented will be for decision in the light of that examination.(c) The main contribution of the East and West African dependenciesshould be the maintenance of an African division for possible service in Africaor in the Middle East. In addition, there is a possibility of raising pioneer units for service in a suitable climate overseas if required.(d) The raising of further combatant units for service overseas is not now recommended, save possibly in the case of the West Indies and Cyprus, wherethere are political reasons which make the raising of a combatant unit desirable.This matter is now under consideration between the War Office and the ColonialOffice.(e) Where there are Imperial garrisons, there should be the maximum possible dilution by the enlistment of colonial personnel.(/) Arrangements should be made to facilitate the enlistment in the armyand air force of volunteers of European descent from the colonial dependencies.M.
