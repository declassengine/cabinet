TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.       34It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.CRM T.(G)(UO)39. COPY HQ.   J3mfco C.Q.S.(40)231).WAR CABINET.INDIA:    SITUATION IN V/AZIRISTAN.REPORT BY THE CHIgPS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.rV/e have been asked by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence to examine the consequential effects, and risksentailed to our war plans,  of any intensive renewal ofmilitary operations in V/aziristan at the moment,  taking into particular consideration the situation in respect ofRussia.     This question is put to us in the-light--ofcertain operations in the Ahmadzai Salient now proposedby the Government of India and referred to in theSecretary of State for India1s Memorandum (W.P.  (40)(G.)23).Effect of Extensive Operations on the North west frontier on our War Effort.2.       The situation may be broadly summarised as follows(a) v/e are at present in a position where we might shortly find ourselves involved in hostilities ^rith Russia.(b) If this situation arises, we shall have toaccept serious additional commitments whichwill place a severe strain on Alliedresources.      The forces in India will find themselves fully occupied and. we should haveto call upon India to despatch a division toprotect the Anglic-Iranian Oil Fieldsimmediately.(c) As the Foreign Office recently pointed out,as soon as the Afghan Government think that war between Russia and the Allies isimminent, v/e shall probably be faced witha demand for a pact of mutual assistance,and a request for concrete support againsta Russian attack on Afghanistan.XC.0.S.   (40) 224 Para. 7.

This would be an additional demand whichhas not yet been envisaged,and for which no provision has been made in the resources at the disposal of the Government of India.(d) A Russian air attack on North West India,however light the scale, would add to theair defence and the internal securityproblems in that area and would be afurther drain upon Indian resources.(e) Even if Russian hostility does not materialisewe might wish to draw upon India forre-re-inforcement in the ^-vent of a suddendevelopment of the war in the Mediterraneanarea, particularly if Italy became hostile.3.       Prom the point of view of imperial defence there forfeit is of the highest importance that the Government ofIndia should do all in its power to conserve its forces and to avoid undertaking any commitment which is not essential for the security of the country.Proposed Operations in the Ahmadzai Salient.4.       The operations now proposed by the Government ofIndia may be summarised as follows:-(a) The situation in North Waziristan and onthe Derajat Border is bad.      Gangs havebeen very active in this area and warexcitement appears to be on the increase.There are already signs of the extensionof the disaffection northwards.(b) The Government of India consider that operations, by a force of two brigades,in the Ahmadzai Salient, are necessary toput a stop to the trouble and to preventits spread northward.(c) If these operations are undertaken,  theGovernment of India realise that badcharacters- in the neighbouring WaziristanTribes will probably join in the fightingbut that inaction is&quot;impossible, in viewof the continuance of the raiding menacein the district.Public opinion in India is indignant and demands measures for the restoration ofconfidence in the district.      This cannotbe done nor can main communications besecured until the refuges of the gangs(i.e.  the Ahmadzai Salient) have beenneutralised.(d)

(e) On the conclusion of the actual operations,the Government of India intend to transfercontrol of the Ahraadzai Salient to civilforces.(f) Active preparations for these operations are proceeding and the Government of Indiaawait authority to start.conclusions.5. From the Imperial point of view, the fewer themilitary forces that have to he locked up for localreasons the better.     The growth of a local operationinto a major campaign would he a serious matter, in thatit might affect the availability of forces in India forother purposes.6. It is an undoubted fact that the situation inthe Bannu area is now bad.      In the opinion of the Governmentof India it is- ir-tclLorahle &apos;&amp;rtd oajlJLs^fLor--iaimediatemilitary action.7. No one can guarantee that military operationsbegun on a small scale will not grow to much largerdimensions and. this applies especially to the North west frontier-of India.      On the other Ixand^ if-e. doterioratingsituation is not dealt with promptly, the use of a consider--,ably greater force is likely to he required to restore itat a later stage.8. The immediate point at issue, therefore, isquite clear.      It is to decide which of these two dangersis the greater - that of a small commitment undertakennow becoming a large one, or that of inaction now giving rise to a still larger commitment later.9. We understand from the Telegrams/ which have passed/   Annexes 1 and 2.-3-

between the Secretary of State and the Government ofIndia, that the latter consider that the operations arenot likely to entail a commitment larger than two brigades.      Moreover they consider^ it a &quot;matter of theutmost importance to stabilise the situation during theremaining months of the cold weather, to ensure thatdisorders do not spread.to the north, and to apply thenecessary forces before we are faced with largercommitments&quot;.       In view of the foregoing considerationswe do not recommend, from the military point of view,that the War Cabinet should make any representations tothe Government of India with a view to holding up theoperations already contemplated..(Signed)    H.R.S.

ANNEX I.P. Z. 497/0.0. Secret.Cypher Telegram from Secretary ofState to Government of India (external affairs Department), repeated to H.M,Minister, Kabul, No. 22, dated 30thJanuary,  192+0.   (1 98 words).Immediate.h75.    Your telegrain 22+th January, No.  220. AhmadzaiSalient.I presume that you and Cunningham are satisfied thatoccupation of this area will not involve an undue risk ofcausing further trouble elsewhere in \7aziristan.    If so Isanction your proposal in principle and subject to consideration of the following points:-(a)    I am somewhat doubtful whether it would not be preferable to inform the Afghan Government of our intentionas soon as possible in advance rather than simultaneously withany public announcement.    They are entitled to priorinformation of any intended &quot;major&quot; operation, and, though this may not come within that category, it would seem morecourteous, if v/e inform them at all, to do so before the last moment.    I should be glad of your views on this point.    i donot of course suggest that they should be consulted but thatMuhammad Hashim should be informed of our intended action witha full explanation of its necessity.    This might be the best means of forestalling any adverse reaction on their part which it seems desirable to avoid in view of the presentimportance of our relations with them, and the risk of whichcannot be altogether excluded.    It is true that the area is some distance from the Frontier and to the east of the SpinwamLine.    But it will be remembered that Muhammad Hashim has not taken too well our occupation in recent years of other areasin Waziristan though they were also some way from the frontier and within the circular road, and that our alleged &quot;forward&quot;policy, with which permanent occupation of new territors&apos; is associated,  is something of a bugbear to the Afghan Government.(h)    Subject to your further views, I am doubtful whetherit would be expedient to make a public announcement - at anyrate in such detail as to include a statement that our objective is permament occupation at this stage.    Indeed witha view to minimising risk of giving material for enemy propaganda would it not be better to avoid publicity,  so faras this mai* be possible, regarding the operation itself?

COPY.ANNEX II.SECRET.Allotted to Political Department   1h6 groups 7h7.Copies CirculatedDECYPHE&quot;:    OF    TELEGRAM.From     Government of India, External Affairs Department,to Secretary of State for India.Dated   New Delhi,  21.1+5 hours,  1st February,  19LO.Received 18.20 hours, 1st February, 19UO.Immediate.3i8. Addressed to Secretary of State for India repeated toKabul number 5&quot;I.Your telegram No. kl5 dated January 30th.2. Cunningham thinks that Utmanzai V/azirs to some extent and probably Mahsuds, though they are distant, may be expected(sic) to intervene but they will be mainly the present element of the bad characters in somewhat enlarged numbers. He thinksand we agree that necessity of some form of action on theground in the salient outweighs above consideration. Inactionis in our opinion impossible in view of the continuance of theraiding menace in the districts and recent signs of theextension of the raiding activity to Kohat district.Public indignation moreover demands measures for therestoration of confidence in the districts, particularly inBannu area, and this cannot be done nor can main communicationshe secured - until gang refugees has been neutralised.3. Viceroy is holding conference tomorrow and we will reply on points (a) and (b) of your telegram thereafter.h. We are going ahead with active preparations for theoperation.
