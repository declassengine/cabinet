PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES OF BRITISH WARTIME PROPAGANDA.A. CALL TO ARMS. TO EFFORT. TO SELF SACRIFICE.i. This is your war, the people&apos;s war.   You decided,rightly, that it had to come.   You wage it; no one elsecan.    You will end it; for it can&apos;t he fought v/ithoutyou.    You would he responsible, as well as your leaders,if it ended in defeat,2. The war has only just begun.    There are many dangersahp.^d.    The Germans owing to their numbers are thegreatest military power in the world.    For seven yearsHitler and the Nazi Party have been building them intoa war machine.    There may be discontent, but it has novoice; opposition, but it has no power.    It is that warmachine you have to beat.    To that extent you are fighting the German people - 80 million of them.3. The dangers ahead may he physical danger^ - bombing,privation.   You can&apos;t be sure till they happen.    TheGermans have been taught to be ruthless and to hate theBritish.    They are merciless.h. One of the worst dangers is apathy on your part. Itcould lose the war because this is a war of wills aswell as guns.    Don&apos;t be neutral-minded.5. Remember your word is pledged to Prance and othercountries.    Their security is yours.6. No war was ever won without effort, suffering, sacrifice.Make up your minds to them as your enemies have longsince.    In freedom you must be as quick to discipline and self-surrender as men in the bonds of dictatorship.B. WHAT IS AT STAKE.1. What is at stake is the ideal of a good life which freemen have created through two thousand years.    A lifebased on equal justice, respect for the individual,family affections and love of truth.2. Nazi Germany boaots the justice of the Gestapo, the break up of the family, and truth distorted to serveruthless party ends.3. Defeat means the end of life as we understand it in western Europe.4. It also means:(a) A permanently disabled Britain, the command of these as lost, under the thumb of the strongestContinental power.(b) The Gestapo, the concentration camp, Nazi vengeanceon yourself and a quarter of the world, includingmany weak peoples who look to you for protection.These evil things strike at your home, your children,your trade union, your politics, your religion.(c) That the peoples now enslaved by Germany mustabandon hope of liberation.5. A compromise peace with an unbeaten Germany would bedefeat in the long run.

- ?. -6. Victory means(a) Release for Germany&apos;s victims(b) The right to live, think, vote, talk and. worshipGod as you choose.(c) That the new world which must rise from the warwill be Christian and not Satanic, spiritual andnot material,7. You are fighting for justice and decency between man and man, nation and nation.8. This is war by the people and for the people; youreffort, your victory.0.    THE WAY TO VICTORY,1; We shall win the war by our strength; hut that includeswill&apos; and economic pov/er as much as military power.2; We are making an immense effort, by sea, land ai-d air.Our army, navy, air force are alert and valiant.3. Our industrial and financial resources are vital forvictory.    Work for victory; save for victory,h. Be of good heart: we fight for the right and againstevil; we have with us, in growing strength, the freenations of the Emp:&quot;.re from the ends of the earth; theFrench, our allies? are a brave and unconquerablepeople.5. But no magnitude of strength and resources is in itselfenough. There must be a concentration of mind as well.,A determination and a will to victory.6. The greater the will, the greater the effort, the sooner victory, peace and the security of a betterworld.
