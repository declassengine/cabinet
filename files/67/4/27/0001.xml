3 DOCUMENT IS the PROPERTY 0!C R E f.pjG, H40)27CO, Y ITOo&apos;/ar cabinet eI^GOTIiiTIONSTTII ITALY.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of dtate for DominionAffairs,In their joint Memorandum on the subject of negotiations v/ith Italy (V/.p, (g) (40)21) my colleagues,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Ministersatisfactory attitude from Italy in regard to a number of questions arising from the war, the Master of the Rollsshould be authorised to inform the Italian Government thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are preparedto spend some  5,000,000 on the purchase of Italian foodstuffs,in the past been supplied to this country by Dominions.It is, for example, suggested that we should acquire50,000 tons of rice from Italy of a kind of which our norma&apos;imports from all sources are 24,000 tons only.     Australiais a producer and an exporter of rice.     Imports into theUnited Kingdom it is true are smallo     They have averaged9,000 tons per annum only (value  147,500) but this represents20 per cent of Australian production and nearly 30 per cent,of her exportscpurchase from Italy of fresh fruit which, in certain cases,must compete with imports from Australia and South Africathough the effect is not likely in this case to be so serious as in the case of rice.      It seems evident that,unless special measures are taken, the United kingdom market for Australian rice will be entirely destroyedof Economic/Warfare, propose that,  to obtain a moreAmong these appear certain products which may haveThe proposals of my colleagues include also the

with serious effects on a small hut intensive primaryindustry carried on in a district which will probably be seriously hit by the reduction of Australian dried fruitimports into this oountry, itself caused by purchasesmade for economic warfare reasons from   Turkey.There are, no doubt, many considerations whichmust be weighed against each other to enable a decisionto be reached on the present proposals.    I wou?d, however,strongly urge that, in this as in all cases v/here purchases from neutral countries are contemplated which are eithercertain or likely to affect Dominion interests, it is most desirable that I should be afforded an o oortunity at theearliest possible stage of examining such proposals.      I might then be in a position to suggest ways in which theburden to Dominions may be best distributed in the lightof such impairment of their interests as individualDominions may have previously been asked to accept, and where desirable to consult or at least fully inform thethe Dominion Governments concerned in advance.A number of instances have already arisen in which our economic warfare policy has had repercussions on the Dominions.I have mentioned the recent case of the purchase of driedfruits from Turkey which seriously affected important industries in Australia and South . frica and. producedstrong representations from those Governments which arestill under consideration.      Canadian interests also haveinevitably been affected by our urgent need to economisein Canadian dollar exchange.      This haa meant veryserious repercussions on our normal imports of a number of canadian primary products, among which apples and tobaccohave figured prominently.      Our non-commercial purchases ofapples from Italy and tobacco from Turkey are not likely to escape attention in Canada.ouch difficulties are no doubt likely to occurfrequently in the future.

I need not emphasise the great need of avoiding as faras possible causes of dissatisfaction on the part ofDominion Governments with the measures which we ourselvesfeel obliged to take in the common interest of winningthe war.     I do not suggest that the Dominions necessarilyhrve the right to expect that they should be compensated for the damage to their export trade from our policy of purchasing from neutrals goods which we should normallyobtain from the Dominions.      In the interests of good relations, however, it is important that the reasons forany particular course of action should be explained tothem and it is possible to make some use of the argument that, although in certain cases they suffer from our war trade policy towards neutrals, they are reaping considerably from our w;r-time purchases of other Dominions products.This, on the other hand, may not be enough and I cannot besure that in the present case we shall not be faced with aninsistent demand on Australia&apos;s part that we should makea Governmental purchase of the quantity of Australian ricewhich vie have normally taken from that Dominion.There is, as I think my colleagues will agree,considerable force in the argument, which has already been advanced by more than one Dominion, that they wish tomaintain a war effort at the maximum from resources farless elastic than our own;    but that their ability todo so is directly related to their ability to maintain their exports, for which alternative markets are in most casesunobtainable if their outlet to the United Kingdom is wholly or partially closed.      The Dominions have inevitablylost some of their foreign markets, and to others they arerestricting their exports in response to our requests thatthey should adopt a policy of rationing similar to ourown.

I feel justified, therefore, in asking that mycolleagues will take steps to ensure that in all matters affecting or likely to affect Dominion interests, their departments will give the Dominions Office full information at as early a date as possible.     Only so v/ill it be possibleto minimise friction and avoid the creation of a sense of grievance in the minds of Dominion G-governments.      Once suchfeelings are aroused it is much more dhfficult to persuadeDominion Governments of the need to trke a broad view of thesituation, to resist the pressure of sectional interests, andto share in the common sacrifices which are required.(Initialled)    A.SiDominions Office.28th January, 1940.
