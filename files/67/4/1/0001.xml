Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.)

9(b) There is no ground for belief that any undertaking was ever given thatthe 25,000 refugees provided for in the White Paper would beadmitted during the first year. What was said was that these 25,000would be admitted as soon as High Commissioner was satisfied that provision for their maintenance was assured. This might have beenwithin any period, short or long, up to five years, according to circum-stances prevailing. As it turned out. economic conditions in palestine and wave of illegal immigration rendered situation uncertain, and made it impossible for High Commissioner to feel any assurance about any figure approaching 25,000. Indeed, on account of extensive illegal immigration into Palestine (which involves under the White Paperequivalent deductions from annual quotas), no quota was issued inrespect of six-monthly period which began on the 1st October last.However, a large number of refugee and other Jews who had beengranted immigration certificates in the previous quota period had not actually entered Palestine by the 1st October, and validity of theircertificates has been extended. Immigration has consequently beencontinuous up to date.(c) It is untrue that restriction of land sales on lines contemplated in theWhite Paper has been put into force. This matter is at present underthe consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. As soon as final decision on policy has been reached I will telegraph afull appreciation of the position, including the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the matter of land regulations. I will also furnish material for replyto telegram from Dr. Brandeis and his friends, of which text is contained in my telegram No. 944 [of 24th December].
