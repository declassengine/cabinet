Appendix to minutes of the second meeting of the
National Joint Advisory Council on 6th December, 1939.
REPRODUCTION OF THE SUBSTANCE OF A STATEMENT BY
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.
I do not believe that there has ever been a time at
which the financial side of the country's business has been
so important for all as at present, or a time at which
victory depended so much on doing the right thing with
general support. The beginning of the war was so different
from what was generally expected, and the arrangements made
in advance in the financial sphere were so thorough, that
the ordinary person has not felt in any considerable degree
the real v/eight of the extra burden we must face. One of
the handicaps from which we suffer at the present time is
that in so many quarters there is still a failure to understand
the hard struggle before us.
It is my duty, however, to state the truth and to
act without fear in order that this country may use its
resources in such a way as to give us the best chance of
preserving ourselves and our institutions from destruction,
and of recreating the way of life for which we stand.
Last week I had occasion to make a speech in the
House of Commons in which I touched on some matters very
much in point today. I then made six simple points which
I wish to underline today. I said that before the war
began the rate of our public expenditure was already higher
than it had ever been in peace-time. I said that when the
war came upon us our rate of spending quickened enormously
to a rate of something like &#163;2,400 million per annum v/hich
was an increase of about two-thirds on the rate at which we
were previously spending and corresponded to the rate of
expenditure at the end of the last war. I pointed out that
we had struggled to get an enormous contribution from
taxation and that the House of Commons had never before
imposed such burdens as have just been imposed by the
Emergency Budget. I said that,- nevertheless, it still
left us to raise another &#163;1,000 million by borrowing in
order to meet the expenditure of this first year, only
seven months of which are months of war. I added that If
this struggle developed with the frightful expenditure of
munitions and human lives which we suffered in the last war
our total requirements in future years would be far greater;
and, finally, that the present annual rate of public
expenditure approximate to one-half of the total national
income.

The financing of the war is therefore a fearful
problem. It is not to be explained by saying it is due
to waste. Primarily it is due to the enormously expensive
character of modern war. As I have said before, a modern
aircraft costs from three to seven times as much as a
comparable type in 1918] a Division of troops in the Field
costs - largely owing to mechanisation - nearly twice as
much to equip and maintain as it did in the last war; and
the cost of a battleship is now two or three times as great
as it was then. Modern warfare is not only fighting, it
is also an industrial undertaking on a gigantic scale, the
cost of which has to bo found from the Exchequer. where
is another point, too. With the outbreak of war we
redoubled our efforts and laid' plans for immense increases
of output but plans on this scale cannot be brought to
s
full fruition overnight, end the rate of expenditure today
is no measure of what the output of each factory will be or
what the demand for additional labour will be within a very
short time. This war, if it is of long duration, may be
costly beyond any previous experience, and the means of
financing it is the concern of every citizen.
Now that takes me to a further point which I made
also in the House of Commons last Wednesday. We mislead
ourselves if we think of these things merely in terms of
money. Money, I said, after all is only the means of
buying and selling things, but the r e d problem is not a
problem of money but a problem of things. The policy of
the country in war is bound to be first to get the output
of essential goods to the highest conceivable maximum and
at the same time to divert as large a proportion of the
output as possible to war needs.- What the Government is
paying for when it buys munitions is the efforts end
activities of the people, and though it is a hard fact it
must be accepted as a fact that in war there will be far
less material goods left for the civilian public to enjoy'
than they are accustomed to in normal times. That fact
lies at the very centre of our war-time financial problem.
If the Government, as it must, is going to absorb
so much production for war purposes, it is impossible to
make good the deficiency by Increasing imports. The
country's means of paying for imported goods, though li.rge,
are necessarily limited and must be kept in hand for tJ e
contingency of a long war. On the contrary, whet is
required is to increase exports to provide forei,e,n ewchmge.
The available shipping space is also limited. ... arc it
quantity of our shipping resources has to be diverted to
military needs and, apart from that, war conditions involve
constant dislocation end d.elays. Instead, therefore, of
our being able to make good a deficiency of home products
for civilian use by increased imports, the boot is on the
other leg, and the reduction of imported supplies is more
severe than the reduction in home production for the
consumption of the public.
How does all this apply to the parties in industry?
First let me deal with the employer. At the outbreak of
war we took control of a great number of essential business
functions. We requisitioned numbers of buildings and
organisations far various purposes. I fear that, in doing

so, in a variety of ways we jeopardised a number of
business undertakings. I am afraid, too, that
unavoidably we created a certain amount of unemployment,
although my belief is that the growth of unemployment
figures which has be .n so imexpected and distressing a
feature of the initial months of dislocation will quickly
disappear. Ve have boon criticised for our actions and
I take no exception to that. I only say that our plans
were in many instances drawn against a war different from
that which has so far been experienced, but not necessarily
different from that which may be experienced very soon.
As time goes on it must, I think, be the case that the
general tendency of events, the continual and growing
pressure to throw the activities and efforts of the whole
community into the prosecution of the industrial side of
the war, combined with the strict limitations which must
be kept upon our imports, will tend to increase the
numbers of employers who are hit and the numbers of
dividends v/hich are diminished in those trades which in
war are non-essentials and in t' ose trades of which in war
the normal functions are assumed by Government Controls.
In this connection I was much struck during my recent
short visit to Paris by the numbers of shops and other
premises which have been closed - owing, no doubt, partly
to evacuation and mobilisation.
There will be those other trades, and many of them,
which will be busier than ever and having in some instances
exceptional opportunities of profit-making. And there
I would say this: in his speech last April the Prime
Minister already made it plain that the Government did not
mean to tolerate those excesses of profit-rnakina which
occurred in the last war. The principle should, clearly
be that nobody should come out of this struggle better off
than he went in at the expense of his fellows. Go far
as concerns munitions a very careful costing system has
been built up to secure that the Government are not overcharged
and Treasury control will be tightly maintained.
In regard more especially to retail prices, the Government
have already passed the Prices of Goods Bill to ensure
that there is no excuse for profiteering in the staple
commodities. Further, apart from the recent increases of
direct taxation upon the rich, I have added, in the
Emergency Budget, to the National Defence Contribution,
previously imposed, the alternative of 60% Excess Profits'
Duty in cases where Increased profits arose. These are
earnests of the Government's intention to secure, in the
greatest measure possible, equity between businesses among
themselves and equity betv/een businesses and other sections
of the community, and to secure that there shall be no
quarter for the profiteering employer.
A.S to the other side, I want to turn to the
application of the morel principle of what I have
already said to those who work in businesses; and

what I have to say is equally applicable to the wages o"f the
workman and the pay of the manager or the clerk. I have
said that one of the chief contributions which we can all
make to winning the war is to do without things. Doing
without things is unpleasant - I am not talking of those at
the bottom but of the general mass of people - but we are
placing on the armed forces in the field much more unpleasant
burdens which they are bearing with willing and enthusiastic
courage. The civilian should be equally willing to make
the similar sacrifices required of him. The war can as
easily be lost by discontent on the Home Front as by defeat
in battle. If sacrifices are imposed on a population'which
does not understand why they are needed or why they
contribute to winning the war, discontent is inevitable.
Thus the problem of making everyone understand the need for
and importance of doing without things is fundamental, and it
is in this that I thank.your Council can play a part.
The economic argument is, shortly, that in the
pinch of war there is a short supply of many things. You
cannot relieve a lack of things simply by giving people more
money. If that is done they will only use up what is
available more quickly and prices will rise to prevent
supplies being exhausted. You might say "ration". Some
of the staple commodities can be rationed, but many of them
cannot. If we keep down the consumption of rationed
articles and keep their prices low, people will ha/e all the
more mcney to spend on other things and the trouble with
regard to those things which cannot be rationed will be
aggravated.
-
Experience shows that, under such conditions, when
money payments rise , prices invariable rise with them, so that
the persons who receive the higher payments gain nothing.
The simplest form of increasing money is to print more
currency notes. It can be done in other ways too, but
making more money available by these devices does nothing to
increase the supply of things available for the war or for
ordinary use. Inflation, which is really a name for the
process of producing more money without producing more goods,
is really a form of tax which bears most heavily on those
with small incomes0
If there is going to be a shortage of tilings, that
means that the country cannot go on living on the same
standard as in peace-time, The first people to look to are
the rich, and I looked to them in the JCmergency Budget,
but it is a fallacy to suppose that the problem we are up
against can be settled by taxing the rich0 There simply
are not enough of them.
Nothing that could be done more in the way of
taxing the rich would dispense the main body of the people
from making sacrifices. The entire income of all the
Surtax payers, if It were practicable to take it, would
make only a very modest contribution towards the total cost
of the war. To win the war the population as a whole,
and not merely the rich, must do without things.

And now I must say a word about prices. It is not
true to say that any and every rise in price is unjustifiable.
A certain increase in prices is inevitable. The pound will
now buy much less from abroad than before the war, both
because the pound has fallen and because prices are rising
abroad. Other nations may be friendly to us, but it is no
use expecting that on that account world prices will not
rise. They will rise for scarcity and anticipated new
demand in war, and we shall become more and more dependent
on paying the price which international commodities command.
In addition the cost- of shipping, with its changed routes,
its delays and its losses, has increased very much. There
are also, for instance, the troubles of the black-out and
the losses and dislocation while a business is turning over
from one form of production to another. We must set the
strictest limit possible to the increase of prices affecting
the articles that enter into the cost of living of the
population as a whole, and the Ministry of Food control of
prices is an example of what we want to do. There has,
however, inevitably to be an increase in the price of
necessities and a more considerable increase in the price
of goods which are not necessities, and the question is how
are we to regard it. The first natural reaction seems to be
to assume that, if it costs more to make the ordinary
household purchases on the ordinary scale each week, wages
should be proportionately increased. But, if we were t*
treat the increased prices as justifying an automatic sliding
up of wages, that would cut across and defeat the object of
securing the greatest possible proportion of the national
output for war purposes. If wages and salaries are
increased to the extent that prices are increased, people
will be able to buy as much as before; but there won'tbe
as much as before to buy. The increased wages and
salaries in turn lead to a rise in costs. This again leads
to a demand for higher wages and salaries and the process
of increasing money without increasing the output of goods
takes a firm hold and is very difficult to stop. The result
is bound to be that money becomes worth less and less in
terms of goods, that real wages as opposed to money wages
fall, and that every class of the population suffers;
but in particular the poorest suffer most.
Now the moral of all this as I see it - and I am
going to be frank though it may be a hard saying - is this.
Those who work longer hours or who work harder expect more
wages, but if in addition we take it as a principle, in a
time of war when things for civilian use are in short supply,
that so soon as prices rise a case has been made for a
corresponding rise in salaries or wages, then we stultify a ll
our efforts to keep prices down: the wage rise will produce
another price rise and the second price rise a second wage
rise, and so on. I do not want to be taken as implying that
an alteration of prices is no ground for reconsidering the
rates of salaries or wages at all - that would be going t oo
far. Nor is it easy to say precisely where the balance
lies, but there ought to be some standard differing from the
kind of standard we apply in peace-time which would enable
a judgment to be formed as to the reasonableness of demands
which may come forward in different cases such as would do
justice to the needs without setting a spiral in motion.
Just what it is I could not at the moment say, but there
ought to be a slowing down of the tempo.

And now I want briefly to try and test what I have
said against what has been done in Germany and in France.
These are not things of which I can very well speak publicly.
As regards Germany in particular, so much has been done by
the regime to obscure the truth that the truth is very
difficult to ascertain, I would hesitate therefore to use
these figures in public, but in the privacy of this room I
can use them and say that after careful study I believe
them to be substantially right.
My belief is that in Germany, in the year 1 9 3 8 / 9 ,
the national income was about the same as ours (though of
oourse the population was greater) but the taxes raised were
&#163; 2 0 0 millions higher. And that arose in this way. Direct
taxation came to about &#163; 5 5 0 millions, nearly the same as
ours. Indirect - Customs taxes, consumption taxes,
turnover tax and a small income tax on wages came to over
&#163; 5 5 0 millions, while ours came to less than &#163; 3 5 0 millions,
In addition contributions of employers and employed for
health and unemployment insurance came to &#163; 3 3 0 millions &#163;
2 0 0 millions or so more than ours and probably in large
measure they were applied to preparation for war, meanwhile
the official hourly wage for a male skilled worker was just
under 8 0 pfennings, or say l A - and that for a male unskilled
worker say 9 i d , Out of that l A - or 9-4-do there were these
onerous indirect taxes to be paid, as well as a number of
obligatory deductions., including the so-called Winter Relief.
In the first week of war wages were "adjusted in
conformity with war time conditions'1'. A Wage Stop decree
prohibited any increase in wages except by order for the
duration of the war,, All special pay for overtime, night
duty and Sundays was prohibited and all workmen's holidays
were "temporarily cancelled"0
As to France, my understanding of the present
position is that the permissive working week has been
increased to 6 0 hours or - in special cases of national
defence work - 72 hours. The first 4 0 hours are paid for at
the normal hourly rate of wages formerly paid in respect of
the 4 0 hour week. The present overtime rates are only
6 0 of the normal rate, the ether 4 0 % being returned to
the State. And on top of this, the men of military age
not belonging to a military formation pay a national
contribution at the special rate of 1 5 %F instead of the
normal 5 '/a rate.
It also weighs heavily with me that already before
the war, as far as I can judge, about one-half of German
output was available for war purposes0
I have spoken frankly, but I have an unqualified
belief in the good sense of my countrymen and. it is not
good sense to go on living and spending in present
circumstances at the level and rate appropriate to pre-war
days. I feel so deeply the value of all that we are
fighting for and the difference between victory and defeat
that I have been bound in duty to put before you quite
bluntly all that I have said,

SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION BY THE NATIONAL JOINT ADVISORY
gQUKCIL" ON oTH DECEMBER, 1939 j OF THE STATEMENT MADE
TOJTHJLCOUNCIL BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.
MR. WIGGINS (President of the British Employers'
Confederation) said that the statement, for which they
were greatly indebted, was one from which neither side
of industry could derive pleasure, but they had all
hitherto been prepared to face the facts of any situation
and would take the statement into earnest consideration in
the assurance that by so doing they would reach a generally
beneficial understanding,,
SIR WALTER CITRINE (General Secretary of the Trades
Union Congress) endorsed the welcome given by Mr. Wiggins
to the statements He said that the gravity of it was
fully appreciated. He understood however, that it was the
Chancellor's intention that his statement and the conclusion
to be drawn from it should take effect in the negotiations
which proceeded day by day between organisations of employers
and trade unions, He apprehended that, unless the statemen
t and its implications were made plain beyond dispute,
there was considerable danger that it would be misunderstood
and misinterpreted by the membership of the various
organisations on both sides.. Sir Walter feared that the
statement would be interpreted as an indication that the
Government intended to restrain movements towards higher
wages, and particularly to restrain the adjustment of wages
by means of automatic scales related to the cost of living,
In that connection, it had to be borne in mind that
sliding wage-scales on a cost of living basis were in
existence before the war and,- in some cases, had been
introduced since war broke out. Moreover, even though it
was obvious that war must involve sacrifice, the principle
of equality of sacrifice could not be equitably applied
without more attention to the question of (i) profits,
(ii) the available resources of taxation, (iii) the relative
levels of remuneration in different industries, and (iv)
the practicability, even in war time, of transferring
purchasing power from the more highly remunerated, to the
lower paid members of the community of which the newly
increased unemployment allowances were an example.
Finally, Sir Walter emphasised that the authority of
the leaders of organised workpeople is a moral authority
which depends on the maintenance of confidence between the
members and the leaders, and that the Council itself was
inaugurated on the understanding that it would not encroach
upon the jurisdiction of joint machinery existing in the
separate industries,. These circumstances, he said, made it
all the more imperative that the Council should move with
the utmost caution and that, before doing so, it must
subject the Chancellor's statement to very close examination.
THE CHAHCSIJLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, who was compelled at
this stage to withdraw and was again thanked by the Council
for the fulness and. frankness of his statement, stated that
he felt sure that some of the apprehension felt by Sir Walter
Citrine would be removed by such an examination,
MR. LEWIS JONES, IIP. , (Secretary of the South Wales
Siemens Steel Association) said that, as he understood the
Chancellor's statement, there was nothing in it to suggest

that it is wrong to increase wages and that what was
suggested was that there should not he purely automatic
increases equated to increases in the cost of living.;
MR. LEE (Director of the Mining Association of Great
Britain) also said that his own impression was different
from that made on Sir Walter Citrine's mind. He felt
that it was possible to reach a mutual understanding. In
his own industry, it was recognised that the cost of
living was bound to be considered and there are already
sliding scales in existence. To attempt to re-compensate
fully in some industries and not in others meant inequality.
The problem led them into deep water but roust be faced..
The Council ought to keep in the forefront the difference
between our methods of settlement and those in other
countries.
MR. HOLMES (Chairman of the Trades Union Congress
General Council and Secretary of National Union of
AgriculturalWorkers) said that in this country it had
generally been felt that a high wage policy was in the
interest not only of the workers but of the nation. The
workers realised as deeply as anyone how much is at
stake in the war, but it was essential that the confidence
between the members of the unions and their leaders must
be maintained even at the expense of higher wages. He
would like the Government and the employers to bear in
mind the psychological factor and to realise that the
maintenance -of our- pre-sent- -solidity and. s-teength was .worth
paying for
