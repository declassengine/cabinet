Note by the Minlater tb.t- Co-ordination of Defence.
I circulate herewith for consideration, by the
War Cabinet a Memorandum by the Standing in.':,or -Departmental
Committee on Censorship on the extension of postal censorsnip.
It will oe seen that the proposed extension arises
out of the needs of the Treasury in connection with control
of foreign exchange transactions and that, although the
proposal is one for the issue of a world-wide warrant for
postal censorship, it is only intended to use the powers
sought in a narrow sphere and subject in certain respects
to consultation with the Secretary of State for Dominion
Affairs and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
The immediate proposal before my colleagues is
thus a restricted one, but I take this opportunity of
informing them that the whole organisation of the postal
and telegraph censorship has recently been the subject of
inter-departmental discussion. -*s a results it has been
decided that the organisation should be thoroughly reviewer
as a matter of urgency, the review paying particular regard
to the need for, and the best means of, expanding the
organisation in order that it may be able to deal swiftly
with outward bound mails which it will hove to examine in
accordance with the recent decision of the War Cabinet.
The review will also include consideration of the most
suitable location for the censorship to enable it to carry
out its various functions efficiently0
The inter-departmental discussions to which I
havo referred have also led to a tentative conclusion that
ministerial responsibility for the Postal and Telegraph
Censorship might appropriately be transferred from the
War Office to a non-military department, and I understand
that the Secretary of State for War is in favour of this
course,, It may be best, however, for this question to
be left over for decision until we know the extent and
nature of the reorganisation which will no doubt be
necessary within the machine itself0

EXTENSION OF POSTAL CENSORSHIPi
MEMORANDUM BY THE STANDING- INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMITTEE ON
CENSORSHIP.
The censorship of mails was instituted as from
6. 0 p.m. 31st August, 1939 o A list of the countries for
which postal censorship warrants have been issued is given
in the Annex to this Paper.
2. The Treasury have represented to the Standing
Inter-Departmental Committee on Censorship the desirability
of applying to mails between the United Kingdom and the
United States and Canada, a measure of censorship sufficient
to prevent evasion of the Defence (Finance) Regulations.
They point out that uncensored mails may be used to
facilitate illegal dealings in dollar securities and
illegal foreign exchange transactions. In this respect
they consider that the importance of the American market far
outweighs the importance of any financial market on the
continent of Europe, correspondence with which is at present
subjected to censorship.,
3. It may be of interest to record that in the last war
a warrant was issued on the 7th May, 1915, for the censorship
of mails between the United Kingdom and the United
States of America and also South America,, Mails to
Canada were not at first included, but experience shewed
the ease with which the censorship coifld be evaded by this
route and a warrant for Canadian mails was issued on the
18th September, 1916. The censorship could not be made
immediately effective owing to the very large number of

personnel required and for a time only test censorships for
short periods were mads. By October 1915 about 70% of the
mail to North America was being censored.
4. At a meeting on the 5th December, 1939, the Standing
Inter-Departmental Committee on Censorship considered the
problem of the extension of censorship to North American
mails in the light of the representations made by the
Treasury, The Committee agreed that it was not at present
practicable, even if it were desirable, to institute full
postal censorship of these mails. It would, however, be
possible to examine forthwith mails between either the London
area or the E.G. district of the London area and New York,
in both directions, and all but a very small percentage of
letters and packets would catch the same boat as they would
have been carried in had no censorship existed, The
Committee were also of the opinion that Canadian mails should
be censored to prevent evasion, but agreed that the question
of whether these mails should be censored in Canada or in the
United Kingdom should be discussed further between the Postal
and Telegraph Censorship and the Dominions Office, in
consultation with the Canadian Authorities.
Some doubts were expressed by the representatives of
the Ministry of Information and of the Department of Overseas
Trade as to the effect on trade and on American opinion of
the proposed extension, but these doubts were resolved when
the limited nature of the proposal as detailed above was
explained. Further, the inconvenience and annoyance caused
will be far less than that caused by our action in diverting
and examining mails on neutral ships.
0' During the discussion a suggestion was made that a
world-wide warrant for postal censorship should be issued.

It was pointed out, for instance, that troops in Prance are
posting letters in the French civil post offices, and thus
evading the military censorship. Examination of such mail
involves the issue of a warrant for France, although there
is no intention to censor the ordinary mail., Similar
occasions may arise when a limited degree of censorship is
desirable, and the machinery for applying such censorship
should be as simple and quick in action as possible. Further,
the issue of a world-wide warrant has the great advantage
that test censorships can be made (and were made in the last
war), with a view to determining whether any particular
channel is being used for evasion of the normal censorship
routes. As a safeguard, censorship would not be applied
to foreign countries not at present covered by warrants
(other than the United States of America) without the
agreement of the Foreign Officea
The Dominions require special consideration. It may
prove invidious to take powers to censor the Canadian mail
v/ithout taking similar powers in regard to the other
Dominions. The Committee were therefore of the opinion
that the warrant should cover the Dominions; but should
not be applied without the agreement of the Dominions
Office, which would of course consult the Dominions
concerned. It may be pointed out that no publicity is
involved in the proposal to issue a world-wide warrant until
such time as censorship - is actually applied to any particular
mail.
In view of the considerations outlined above, the
Committee were of opinion that a world-wide warrant should
be issued immediately.

6. Summary of Recommendations,
The Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on
Censorship therefore recommend :(
a) That mails between the United Kingdom and
the United States of America should be
subjected to censorship forthwith, to a
degree necessary to ensure that the Defence
(^Financa)^ Regulations are not being
evadedo
(b) That similar action should be taken in
regard to mails between the United Kingdom
and Canada, the question of whether such
mails are censored in this country or in
Canada being determined in consultation
between the Dominions Office, the
Government of the Dominion of Canada and
the Control].er of postal and Telegraph
Censorship,,
(c) That in connection with (a) and (b) above, a
world-wide postal censorship warrant should
be issued., on tne understanding that ..
censorship should not be applied to mails
between the United Kingdom and the
Dominions (other than Canada) without
the agreement of the Secretary of State
for Dominion Affairs, and between the
United Kingdom and foreign countries
(other than the United States of America
and the countries detailed in the Annex
hereto) without the agreement of the
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
