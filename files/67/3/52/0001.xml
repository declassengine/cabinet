PROCEEDINGS OF THE RECENT LEAGUE COUNCIL AND
ASSEMBLY.
Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
I CIRCULATE to my colleagues for their information a report by
Mr. R. A. Butler, M.P., the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, on the proceedings at the recent League Council and Assembly, which he
attended as representative of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom.
H.
Foreign Office, December 26, 1939.
United Kingdom Delegation to Viscount Halifax.
(No. 43. Confidential.)
My Lord, Geneva, December 22, 1939.
THE public proceedings at the recent League Council and Assembly have
been described in my despatches Nos. 44 and 45 of the 22nd December, but, as is
usual on these occasions, much of the interest and importance of the meeting lay
in the private activities and conversations which members of the delegation were
able to have with the League Secretariat and with the numerous and not
uninteresting delegates or personalities from other countries.
2. It is worth speculating why the Finns decided to bring their case against
Soviet Russia to the League. /Fhey did not consult His Majesty's Government
about the advisability of their action; they do not appear to have taken the advice
of the French, and they certainly did not consult Sweden or the other Scandinavian
H. Governments. Before they took the final step, on t h e ^ n d December, it was, however,
quite clear that the Russian aggression had "become a burning topic in
Geneva. The Fourth or Budget Committee was sitting with Russian representatives
present, and feeling was running high. It is probable that the views of
the South American representatives and the strong personal sympathies expressed
by M. Hambro and the Norwegian Chairman of the Supervisory Commission had
their intended effect. It was further reported from more than one source that the
United States Ambassador in P a r i s supported the suggestion of an appeal to the
League. The enthusiasm with which certain members of the French delegation
showed at the Finnish action at least suggests that to a part of the French
Government the step was far from unwelcome.

3. The Finns can have had few illusions about the practical value of their
action; at one stage, indeed, the Finnish delegate said to some friends that if
only he could obtain a hundred aeroplanes he would be quite indifferent to whateyer
the Ljague did. In the event, embarrassments to the French and British
Governments were in large measure avoided, and the League meetings served
to concentrate world sympathy for Finland and to provide a means of stimulating
help from quarters which, loud in expressions of sympathy, appeared to have no
interest in going beyond words.
4. It would, however, seem desirable, if a future similar case should arise
and Roumania, for example, should contemplate an appeal to the League against
Germany, Russia, or even Bulgaria, that she should discuss her intention in
advance at least with her guarantors.
5. I have referred to the pleasure which some of the French delegation
showed at the turn of events. This reflected M. Daladier's determination to
secure the condemnation and expulsion of the Soviet Government. His reasons
for desiring swift and decisive action were attributed by his friends to his desire
to strike a further blow against the French Communists, to anxiety lest hesitancy
should alienate American opinion, and to his hope that firm and united action
by League members might form a valuable precedent for the future. These ideas
were not shared by all the French delegation, which was exceptionally large
and included politicians who were known to incline to the view that Russia
was a far greater danger than Germany, and that if nothing was done to bring
the two closer together, there would be a chance of making terms with German)'.
This divergence of view threatened atfirst to be a serious embarrassment, for
not without some encouragement from German and Italian agents, and assisted
by the panicky attitude of the Secretariat the report, originating with part of
the French delegation, was spread that the British were not at all in line with
the French over the question of Russia's exclusion. This was strongly denied
by me; yet so definite did the rumour appear to be that I decided to make a
special stand in the private session of the committee set up to consider the Finnish
appeal. Needless to say, the legion of muzzled journalists attributed to me the
suggestion of the Bolivian delegates for a twenty-four-hour ultimatum to Russia.
I had suggested that the committee should continue its work in preparing a
report about the dispute pending the receipt of a reply from M. Molotov. Thereafter
Anglo-French co-operation was put beyond doubt, and at the end, at a joint
Anglo-French press conference, M . Paul Boncour and I were able to give an
almost unneeded demonstration of our unity. Our speeches to the Council and
Assembly, in which we said that in our major struggle we were really engaged
in defending the cause of all independent nations, appeared to make a good
impression on neutral delegates, who, whatever their fears and hesitation in
debate, did not, in conversation, attempt to conceal their belief that nothing that
was done at Geneva would really bring Russia closer to Germany if this was not
in Russian interests. This was particularly the view of the Turk, who took a
more robust view than some other neighbours of the Soviet Union. The Iranian
delegate suffered from a diplomatic illness in Paris.
6. The Scandinavians, for whom Sweden acted as spokesman, insisted with
the Swiss, Dutch and Belgians that the Russo-Finnish dispute was to be regarded
as the only political item on the agenda. Their hesitations and reservations
throughout were made rather with the idea of being quoted to the Germans and
Russians than from any conviction that words would suffice to save them from
Finla,nd's fate. The same appeared to be true of the Yugoslav and Greek
delegations.
7. The attitude of the Chinese deserves a special note. One of the chief
embarrassments His Majesty's Government anticipated from a meeting of the
League was the raising once more of the Chinese claim to League assistance
against Japan. The Chinese appeal is permanently inscribed on the Council
agenda; and, if Dr. Wellington Koo had persisted, he might have obtained much
support in arguing that, if Russian aggression was to be condemned, there should
be a fresh condemnation of Japanese aggression. The inadvisability of haying
any other political item on the agenda was, however, readily accepted by
Dr. Wellington Koo, who contented himself with a speech in a private meeting
of the Council. Dr. Wellington Koo also explained in private that he was in an
extremely difficult position in regard to the expulsion of the Soviet Union, which"
had so greatly assisted China in the Far East. At the last moment, when China's
re-election to the Council was in the balance, Bolivia declared that there was a
risk that Dr. Wellington Koo would be instructed by his Government to vote
against the expulsion of Russia rather than to abstain. Thus the CounciFs
intention of expelling Russia might be defeated. The Duke of Devonshire was
charged to interview Dr. Koo and succeeded in obtaining a promise from him
that he would lose his instructions were they to arrive in time. On this understanding
the embarrassing ejection of China from the Council was avoided.
Dr. Koo was suitably grateful.
8. The Argentine move for expulsion of Russia was supported energetically
by Bolivia, Venezuela and Uruguay. Mexico, Colombia and Cuba, while in no
way condoning Russian aggression, were less emphatic; Peru, having given
notice of resignation, was unrepresented, and Chile announced her unconcern
with European affairs. It is not uninteresting to note that the Argentine
delegation declared in private conversation that the United States would not be
sorry to see the Argentine leave the League as a result of a failure of their move
for the expulsion of Russia. Their country, they said, was the only one which
reacted against the idea of a pan-American concert under United States direction.
It was, therefore, in the interests of Argentine general policy that they should
not be forced to carry out their threat of leaving the League, for that would
mean cutting a last link with Europe, and would leave the pan-American scheme
unchallenged. There may be some truth in this, but a stronger influence with
most of the Latin American countries, as with the Portuguese, whose delegate
expressed it very forcibly at the last meeting of the Assembly, would seem to be
detestation of the Comintern. The vote for Russia's exclusion was regarded in
these circles as depriving her of a platform and a centre of intrigue. M. Avenol
himself told me that the Soviet Union had never collaborated in any economic or
social activities of the League, but had hoped to use it as a centre of propaganda.
9. The chief Spanish member of the Secretariat said that the League having
acted as she did, he thought a gradual return by his country to technical
collaboration might be possible.
10. The meeting of the Council and Assembly attracted considerable
attention from the press both in Europe and America, and no less than
125 journalists were present, which would have been a representative number
even in the days of the League's greatness. Included in this total were twentyfour
American correspondents, many of them well known in the United States,
and some thirty-five Germans, who, however, were drawn from the ranks of
German correspondents domiciled in Switzerland, no special correspondents, so
far as is known, having come specially from Germany for the occasion. The
interest shown by the world press was marked, and on the two final days of the
Council's session London editors telephoned to urge correspondents to lengthen
their messages, a request which no journalist in Geneva had received for some
considerable time.
11. To sum up, once the Finnish appeal had been made and the expulsion
of the Soviet Union proposed, His Majesty's Government and the French
Government were faced with a dilemma. To expel the Soviet Union from the
League was a provocative act, without practical value, against a country which
His Majesty's Government had no desire to seek a further cause of quarrel. The
effect of publicly isolating the Soviet Union might be to improve the prospects
of German-Soviet collaboration. Finally, the Scandinavian Governments,
particularly Sweden, on whom the responsibility mainly rests of making possible
assistance to Finland, were opposed to the decision.
12. On the other hand, an attempt to compromise on the issues raised would
have inevitably had most unfortunate consequences. The moral case of the Allies
would have been seriously and perhaps fatally prejudiced throughout the Spanishspeaking,
and, indeed, throughout the Catholic, world. A number of resignations
from the League would have taken place and the disintegration of that institution
hastened. An excellent opportunity would have been given to German
propaganda, which could have represented that the United Kingdom and France
were treating Russia more lightly than Italy and Germany. The attitude of
the Allies would have been universally interpreted as due to weakness and fear.
This would have encouraged the aggressors and correspondingly discouraged the
prospective victims, notably in the Balkans. Tor the delegates of the Balkan
States, though shivering with terror, were not opposed to a firm front being
shown, provided that they did not have to bear any responsibility. The choice
between these alternative courses was, therefore, not a difficult one. It onlv
remained to ensure that the question should be rapidly dealt with in order to
avoid any appearance of doubt and dissension. Up to the present time the
a t t i t u d e adopted by the British and French delegations has been fully justified.
The action taken by the League has met with a very wide measure of approval the
reaction of the Soviet Union has been extremely mild; and no loophole has
been given to hostile propaganda.
13. It remains to consider the recent meetings in relation to the future
of the League. M. Colijn, perhaps the most notable international figure visiting
Geneva, told me that in his opinion this war would mark the end of neutrality
for small States adjacent to belligerent countries. Whether this be so or not, it
would seem difficult for small neutrals to continue either their national existence
or as effective members of the League without showing their colours. The very
crisis through which we are passing may, by challenging signatories of the
Covenant, reveal to them the value of its principles. There are fundamental
difficulties in converting the League into a Grand Alliance, however much its
members may be forced together by the present challenge. It may, therefore, do
its best work if, as at present constituted, it frankly accepts the fact that in the
political sphere it has severe limitations. There is, therefore, much to recommend
a concentration upon economic and social activity, such as is suggested by the
authors of the Bruce Report. Meanwhile, His Majesty's Government, by
encouraging this development, might help to save the League from its friends as
well as from its enemies. This last meeting has shown that embarrassments can
be avoided, and they may be avoided in the future if the League is not too
ambitious, but encourages the growth of methods of international co-operation,
which would prove valuable after the war.
I have, &amp;c.
