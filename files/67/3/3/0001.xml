WAR CABINET.
CONDITIONS IN GERMANY.
Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, the attached
translation of an account of conditions in Germany which was sent to the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary by Dr. Goldmann, representative of the Jewish
Agency in Geneva.
While there are certain passages which should not be accepted as certainly
correct, the whole picture fits in with reliable reports which have been received.
This account has more colour than most, and we have usually found that the
sender's information is reliable.
H.
Foreign Office, November 23, 1939.
(Translation.)
THE greater part of this report is the work of an Italian personality who
has just spent twelve days in Germany and who knows the country well. The
information it contains has been picked up from high military circles, from
leaders of economic life (directors of banks and important industrial enterprises),
and from active Communist workers, as well as from partisans of monarchist
tendencies. The person in question has, moreover, made contact with the middle
classes in Berlin as well as in provincial towns. The report has been completed
with data from a few other sources.
I.The Facts.
As is well known, nearly everything is rationed in Germany. It is
practically speaking impossible to obtain coffee and tea; the milk is very much
' ' watered-down ' ' ; the bread is still eatable. The dishes in restaurants are
becoming worse and worse, and meat, bread, "and butter are only obtainable in
exchange for coupons. For a beefsteak in a restaurant 20 grammes of butter
10719 [20366]
and 100 of meat have to be given up. whereas the weekly ration is 80 grammes
of butter and 2 0 0 of meat. Fish and game are not rationed. For wool, silk
and cotton there are ration cards, and clothing, linen, shoes and stockings are to
be had only in exchange for these cards. If one already has two pairs of stockings,
it is impossible to obtain a ration card to buy a third pair. People are afraid to
ask for these ration cards, for it frequently happens that this request provokes
a search of the house and that everything is confiscated. The greatest shortage
is of shoes. Shoes made of wood are expected before long. The result is that
the shopkeepers are in great difficulties and everyone is saying that the shops
are soon to be closed. There is no hunger as yet, but for hard manual labour the
rations are insufficient. It is significant that people spread potato puree on their
bread, for there is nothing else available. For children, too, the rations are
not enough. But generally speaking they are sufficient to nourish one, though
badly. The distribution of food is badly organised. Queues are forbidden, and
women who are standing waiting are often carried off by S.S. men to peel potatoes
in the barracks. In spite of that, there are queues to be seen.
The street-scene has changed a lot in comparison with last year. The clothes
are of bad quality, the people thin and anxious, the markets empty. Private cars
have almost disappeared, only dignitaries of the party, doctors and high officials
now go by car. The taxis, too, have little petrol and may only be used by foreigners
or by Germans in urgent cases only. . There is a particular lack of cotton wool for
medical purposes, of bandage material, iodine and soap, the latter being often not
even obtainable with the ration card. In the factories, even in munition factories,
there is a lack of rubber and raw materials, which often causes a suspension of
work.
The towns are completely blacked-out. Some time ago the black-out was
discontinued in Berlin, because revolutionary slogans had been written up under
cover of darkness, but it has now been reimposed. The S.S. are employed in the
morning cleaning up the streets to remove these slogans and in the afternoon, in
civilian clothes, they act as spies by listening to conversations.
A large number of towns in the west, like Saarbriicken, Karlsruhe and others,
have been evacuated. In the first two towns, evacuation was ordered in the space
of half an hour. The population could only take away hand baggage. At the
time of the evacuation children were separated from their parents and wives
from their husbands. The housing of the evacuees is very badly organised and
leaves much to be desired.
The general tendency is not to allow the people fully to realise that they are
at war. All troop movements take place at night, as well as evacuations.
Casualty lists are not published, and families may not wear mourning for soldiers
fallen in the war. On the other hand, posters in public premises urge the people
to dance.
II.The Morale.
The morale is on the whole bad. People are either anxious and perplexed or
depressed, and feeling is to a large extent directed against the regime. From this
point of view the report of a soldier who fought in Poland is characteristic. He
says : " The morale of the troops was not as in 1914, but as in November 1918.
There is no longer any party influence in the ranks. Members of the party did not
dare wear the party badge, but we knew who they were and picked quarrels with
them. The soldiers were often very insolent to the officers, and sergeants who tried
to adopt their barrack-room tone of voice often had to reckon with a bullet in the
back. We looted wherever we could. A number of men of our company often
disappeared for a few days in order to rest. True discipline is to be found above
all among the young soldiers who have not known the time before nazism.','
The pact with Russia is still incomprehensible for most people. Only the
Communist workers are beginning to see its importance. They are stirring, but
they are not yet active, for they are convinced that time is on their side. They
are counting with certitude upon the impending bolshevisation of Germany. The
Social Democratic workers are anti-Russian in their attitude, consider Russia has
betrayed them, and fear bolshevisation no less than the middle classes. People
do not understand the transplantation of the Baltic Germans. Many believe that
Russia paid for it in foreign currency. The release of many Communists from
concentration camps is an established fact. The existence of an organised
Communist propaganda is impossible to discover. This work is being carried on
in an underhand way among the working class. There is also reason to consider
the bomb attacks on the Air Ministry as isolated acts rather than to attribute
them to an organisation. Apart from the supporters of the regime, who are the
party officials, the Nazi officers and State officials, whose very existence is bound
up with the party, there are two main opposing tendencies : the pro-Russian
tendency and the tendency towards a rapprochement with England.
The pro-Russian tendency demands the complete bolshevisation of Germany
with the help of the Russian army. The dangers of a victory for communism in
Germany should not be underestimated. The signs in its favour are the constant
and rapid proletarisation of the middle classes, the famine in sight, the ruin of
trade and small industries, the discontent of the peasants who have been despoiled,
the ludicrous pay-scale of the reservists and the insufficient help given to their
families.
The pro-English tendency is to be found among the leaders of the army and
of the national economy. There are frequent consultations between these two
groups. One of their plans includes the setting-up of a new Government
composed of six generals, six economists and six members of the Party. This
Government would depose Hitler, Hess, Goebbels and the leaders of the Party,
keeping perhaps Goring. The first step it would take would be the suppression
of the party. Influential economic circles believe that bolshevisation could still
be stopped. What they fear is that, in the event of the regime falling, the Allies
would split up Germany, and even then they would be ready to continue the
struggle.
The offensive in the west is generally considered hopeless by the officers,
especially if it took place in winter and if the motorised columns could not be
used to the best advantage. The old pre-war officers are mostly in opposition; the
death of von Fritsch especially disgusted them. [It is said that he was not
murdered, but went off on a patrol with eight men, seeking death, for it was he
who had drawn up the plan for an offensive against Poland, and he had not been
called upon in the Polish campaign. His death has aroused profound bitterness
among the older officers.] Brauchitsch is said to be devoted to the Ftihrer, who
facilitated his divorce by the payment in full of his pension to his ex-wife and
thus enabled him to marry his mistress. The reserve officers prefer to go out in
civilian clothes, for the uniform of commissioned officers is no longer respected.
I n the last few months, opposition has increased enormously. A symptom :
Niemoller, revered as a demi-god by the Protestants, had received permission to
serve as a lieutenant-commander; he preferred to remain in the concentration
camp. The fact is well known. In spite of that, prayers are said for him on
Sundays in Church and the bells are rung for him.
The Fuhrer shuts himself up more and more. Nobody may see him alone.
Any question about which it is desired to consult him must be submitted to a
commission which decides what may be discussed with him. He sees only Hess
alone. Krupp von Bohlen, who recently wished to talk to the Fuhrer, was also
required to appear first before the Commission, whereupon he gave up his
interview with Hitler, saying that William I I was surrounded by one Great Wall
of China, but the Fuhrer by three.
Ribbentrop's star is waning. Some say that he was told to make the Danzigspeech
to make himself appear ridiculous. The press commentaries on his speech
gave the unfavourable foreign criticisms rather than the customary eulogies.
Goring keeps very much out of the limelight; he is the most popular of the wellknown
leaders. It is considered possible that he may survive the regime.
The determination of many opponents of the regime is becoming considerably
more marked. These circles are awaiting a favourable moment for a bloody
settling of accounts. There are many who are preparing lists of Nazis they then
want to kill. These people want the blockade to be tightened still further and
the famine to be greater. They consider the English propaganda by the dropping
of pamphlets ineffective and even very harmful, because it awakens the suspicion
among the people that England dare not launch herself heart and soul into the
fight. All these people count on a collapse in the spring and do not believe in a
long war. But they consider it possible that before its collapse the regime may
make a desperate attempt at a break-through by^sacrificing millions of men.
The leaders of the regime are very well informed about popular feeling.
Spying has increased in unheard-of proportions; there are spies in every house.
The internal propaganda is still very clever and effective. The arguments most
used, especially in propaganda by word of mouth, are the following :
1. It is stated that a new aerial weapon, Ekrasit, exists, which is capable of
destroying, by means of a 5-kilogram bomb, a whole quarter of a
town. With this weapon, it is claimed, England will be laid in ruins.
2. It is claimed that one new submarine, to contain two men, is built every
day, and that by the spring there will be 500 of these submarines;
England may then be starved out.
3. The impression is given that Spain and Italy have remained faithfully
by the side of Germany and are only awaiting the favourable moment
to declare war. It is also claimed that Ibn Saud is preparing to give
active aid to Germany.
The number of arrests is increasing in incredible proportions. It is, however,
interesting to note that, according to numerous reports, the treatment accorded in
concentration camps has become more humane, because the guards and their
leaders are beginning to be afraid of the day of reckoning.
The anti-English propaganda is proving effective inside Germany, and is
also creating with many opponents of the regime the impression that England
is seeking to destroy not only the Nazi regime, but also Germany once and for all.
Anti-Jewish feeling is also firmly anchored, even in those circles which are
opposed to Hitlerism itself.
To sum up, it may be said that a large part of the German people shows
resignation, sometimes tempered with humour; it expects anything, without
faith in the future, but ready to accept everything; another part is still confirmed
in its opposition to the regime, but nevertheless is divided into two camps, as is
stated above; some see salvation in the victory of communism and others are
seeking it in an understanding with the democracies; apart from that, the Party,
the officials and the parasites of the regime are fiercely determined to preserve
their positions. It is naturally difficult to estimate the numerical importance of
these groups; one can, however, say that the great majority is not behind the
regime. In cultured and intellectual circles few people believe in the possibility
of a victory. The determination to wage a bloody struggle against the regime
grows from day to day. There is a general conviction that the collapse can only
be a question of months and no longer of years.
