STATE OF PUBLIC OPINION AS REGARDS
CIVIL DEFENCE MEASURES.
Report by the Civil Defence Committee,
1. The Civil Defence Committee are seriously disturbed
by the growing tendency; in quarters which reflect and shape
public opinion, to decry as unnecessary or over-cautious many
of the measures which have been taken to safeguard the national
interests against air attache This tendency is well illustrated
by the increasing complaints against the measures taken for the
evacuation of civilians from London. If these complaints were
confined to the plans for the evacuation of Government staffs,
they might be thought to nave been provoked mainly by the
indignation to which the requisitioning of hotels and schools
has given rise: But complaints are also being levelled against
the action taken by business houses who have removed their
headquarters staffs from London, under arrangements for which
the Government were not responsible. Criticism is beginning
to be directed against the policy of dispersal itself, and the
suggestion is now being put forward that the dislocation of
cormerce and industry which this dispersal entails is an
excessive insurance ;ainst risks which have not actually
materialised. Precautions of this kind of course, in the
nature of an insurance, and it may be arguable in any individual
case whether the premium is too high for the risk: but, taken j
as a whole, evacuation was an integral part of our Civil Defence
policy, and if the impression is allowed to gain ground that any
measure of evacuation is an unnecessary precaution and a mistakei
policy the Committee feel that this will have ^rave reactionson
our Civil defence measures as whole This attitude
towards evacuation is symptomatic of a potential scepticism
about the whole scale of Civil Defence preparations. Criticisms
of the black-out., the strength of the Civil Defence personnel,
the emergency hospital scheme, all reflect the same tendency
to call in question the need for the precautions which have
been taken; and in the present state of public opinion there
is real danger that the re-adjustments which have been made to
meet present circumstances may be interpreted as an admission
that the scale of our Civil Defence measures was out of proportion
to any risks to which we are likely to be exposed. At
the present moment public opinion is only too ready to discount
the risks of large scale air attack, merely because no such
attack has yet been delivered; and unless active steps are
taken to counter this spirit of false optimism we may well find
that, by the time the blow falls, we shall have dissipated the
resources and broken the morale which we had built up to resist
it.
2, The Committee therefore desire to call attention to
the strategical hypothesis on which the scale of our Civil
Defence preparations was based, The underlying assumption was
that, in the event of war with Germany, heavy air attack on this
country might be maintained for some months. In 1935 the Air

Staff estimated that 150 tons of bombs per day might be dropped
at the beginning of the attack (A,R.P. (0) Pjner 493)0 In 1937,
they took the view that by 1 9 3 9 the German Air Force would be
able to maintain an attack on the scale of 600 tons of bombs
per day over a period of some weeks (C.I.D. 300th Meeting,
Conclusion (3)). In 1939 the estimated scale of attack was
still further increased, It was assumed that the weight of
the attack -would be directed primarily at the main centres
of population, and it was concluded that London might be the
target of a concentrated attack, involving the possible
dropping of 2,000 or 3,000 tons of bombs per day for two or
three daysD What these estimates represented in fact may be
gathered from the following extract from a report made by the
Sub-Committee on the Evacuation of Government"Departments in
July, 1939. (CI.D. Paper 325-A):"
We understand that ii is the present view of the Air
Ministry that on the outbreak of war air attacks of such
intensity might be developed in London that only staffs
working in deep underground protection could be expected
to carry on work regularly 0... and that this period
of intense enemy air attack activity might last for a
period of three months0"
Public reference to these dangers were made in guarded terms
fr?'om time to time by Government spokesmen,, and they were set
out in some detail in the Report of the Committee on Evacuation
(Cmdo 5 8 3 7 ) published in the summer of 1 9 3 8c
3. Plans for Civil Defence were based from the outset
on these estimates by the Air Staff of the probable nature and
scale of the attack which might be expected,, The grading of
areas from the point of view of vulnerability, the nature and
extent of the precautionary measures to be taken in each area,
the sise of the air raid precautions services, and the amount
of equipment, were all determined in relation to the Air Staff
appreciations of the probable risks0 Some parts of the
plans - for example, the lighting restrictions and the evacuation
policy - are not entirely dependent on a quantitative estimate
of the risks involved,, Other elements in the plans are more
directly related to the estimated tonnage of bombs which might
be droppedo Thus, the emergency fire brigade organisation has
been based on a calculation of the numbers of fires likely to
be caused by the incendiary bombs which could be dropped by a striking
force of the magnitude assumed by the Air Staff.
Ultimately it proved impossible to keep abreast of the
increasing scales of"attack forecast by the Air Staff, and the
present arrangements for fire and hospitals services particularly
must be regarded as an under-provision, if the dangers
are as substantial as they are represented to be in the later
Air Staff appreciations. The available resources of manpower
and equipment would in any event have imposed a limit
on any further expansion of the Civil Defence services
Within the limits of what is practicable, however, the
c
organisation has been related to the scale of attack envisaged
in the Air Staff appreciations0
4, The Civil Defence organisation is in no way
excessive for the purposes for which it was designed, viz:
to withstand the shock of intensive air attack on our great
centres of population. And, so far as the Committee are
aware, nothing has occurred to indicate that, if the enemy:s
present policy were changed and sxxch an attack were delivered,

it would be delivered on a scale much less than that hitherto
assumed by the Air Staff. The doubts which the public are
"beginning to entertain about the scale of our preparations are
due, not to any belief that the striking power of the enemy is
less than was assumed, but to a belief that that striking power
will not in face be used for large-scale air attack on this
countrye For some time past the assumption had been that war
with Germany would moan intensive air attack on this country
from the first moment of hostilities. This assumption was
fairly widely known, and when war came the people were braced
to moot the shock of such an attack. How that we have boon at
war for more than three months and no such attack has been
launched, it is only too easy for the average man to slip into
a mood of complacency and to delude himself into supposing that,
because this attack has not been delivered, the danger of it has
nov/ passedo It is easy, too, for the public to misinternret
the experience of the reconnaissance raids which have taken
place over this country and to under-rate, by reference to that
experience the very different situation which we should have
s
to face if bombing attacks were made on a large scale. An
element in the public appreciation of the situation is
undoubtedly the belief that the months which have elapsed since
the outbreak of hostilities have been utilised in effecting
such an improvement of our defence against air raids as substantially
to have mitigated the risk, and consequently a
false sense of security has been engendered.
5. The Committee believe that there is no justification
for this mood of easy optimism; and they think it important
that effective steps should be taken without delay to check
tendencies which may well cause a dangerous deterioration in
public moraleo All sections of the public would like to be able
to think that the risk of air attack is less remote, and there
is a real danger that this general desire may be played upon
by people who have a direct interest in securing a relaxation
of the restrictions imposed in preparation for such attack.
It is Worthy of note that the Communist Party, for example,
which has launched a ;,Stop the Jaru campaign, is already making
use in its propaganda of references to the inconveniences
occasioned to the public by Civil Defence measures.
6 0 The Comraittee therefore suggest that the Chiefs of
Staff should at once be asked to review in the light of the
considerations mentioned above, the assumptions on which the
nature and scale of civil defence preparations were based, and
that in the light of that review immediate steps should be taken
to inform public opinion throughout the country in the clearest
and most authoritative fashion of the realities of the situation
as they appear to the War Cabinet. They suggest that this
pronouncement should be made by a member of the War Cabinet,
preferably the Prime Minister himself. It should be made clear
that the whole policy of Civil Defence is based on the
assumption that"sooner or later this country may be subjected
to heavy air attack, and that as long as any risk of such
attack remains it is imperative that the policy should stand as
a whole, unimpaired at any rate in its essentials. The
question at Issue is not merely that of evacuation alone. It
concerns other major aspects of our civil defence policy, for
example, the provision of emergency hospital facilities, the
organisation of the air raid precautions and auxiliary fire
services, and the maintenance of the black-out and other
necessary restrictions. All those precautionary measures are
closely inter-related, and all are based on the same estimate

o f the probable effects of air attack. If public oninlon
is allowed coo lightly 'co -chin); that any one of these
measures is an unnecessary or excessive precaution, there
is gru'.ve ris.;;: uhat this view may re-act dangerously on
the other measures, which arc based on the same assumptionsand
one whole structure of our Uivil iJefence organisation '
may he so seriously impaired that it will be impossible to
re-bullci i;c when the onslaught v/liich it was designed to
meet is actually imminent.
