AM7IOU1TCEMEITT OP SKIPPING- LOSSES IK THE
B R I T I S H BROADCASTING CORPORATION NEWS BULLETINS
Memorandum by the Minister of Information
1. The War Cabinet have recently requested me (War Cabinet
conclusions Ilk (39) and 117 (29) to consult with the First Lord
of the vldmiralty on certain points arising out of the presentation
of news in the B0B0C.-. bulletins relating to shipping losses due to
enemy action,
2. I recognise that the question is one of the first importances
as affecting the morale of (1) our own sailors both naval and
mercantile and fishermen (2) neutral merchant shipowners and.
seamen; (3)s
the general public at home and throughout the Empire.
It has also a bearing on enemy and neutral opinion generally.
3* The main criticism by members of the Cabinet has been that the
method of presenting these items of news is unduly depressing. The
specific suggestion has heen made that it would be better if
shipping losses were announced at weekly intervals.rather than as
they occur.
h. I circulate some Notes on the subject which have been supplied
to me by the Director-General of the BoB.C. In my view the arguments
which he adduces against limiting the announcement of shipping
losses to a weekly broadcast are convincing. To do so would impair
the B.B.C1s reputation for giving a prompt and reliable news service
and would be an undesirable departure from the policy of telling
the truth; however unpleasant, which has been laid down for guidance
by the Prime Minister. It is doubtful moreover whether it would
achieve the object desired as such losses will in any oase be
broadcast by foreign stations, some of which5 Hamburg in particular,
are readily audible by ships in the North Sea and stations in this
country generallyo The announcement together and at one time of a
whole week's accumulated losses might well have a most alarming
effect-. I may add. that it is5 in my view,, inexpedient that the
Press and the B0B0G" should have different policies and practice in
the reporting of shipping losses. The discrepancy would be quickly
Noticed at home and abroad and might cause disquiet. I invite
attention to the mitigating measures indicated in paragraph 5 of
the Director-General's Notes and suggested in paragraph 7 of this
Memorandum. I recommend that these measures should be given a fair
trial before any other action is taken.
5* The difficulties which confront the B.B.C are embarrassing.
The Prime Minister on 2 6 t h November assured the public that we
shall not follow the German example of concealing our losses and
that "we shall never refrain from publishing news except when it
would be helpful to the enemy to have it". Since this general

declaration was broadcast the War Cabinet on Lhth December invited
the First Lord of the Admiralty in association r/ith myself "to
arrange for widespread and repeated diffusion of information as to
sinkings of neutral ships and the inhumanity of German methods of
sea warfare.'1' On 16th December the First Lord "deplored the
unrelieved pessimism of the B.B.C. broadcasts which unfailingly
opened with a long account of ships sunk" and. suggested to the War
Cabinet "that it would be sufficient if we were to broadcast our
shipping losses once a week". On 18th December the First Lord
again drew the attention of the War Cabinet to "the highly
prejudicial effect on public morale of the announcements relating
to shipping matters in the BoB.C. news bulletins". I do not see
how the 3.3.C. can conform fully to these various injunctions and
admonitions and it is obvious that there must be some compromise.
6 . It has also to be borne in mind, that in many cases the news is
in the form of official communiques transmitted to the B.3.C. for
publication which they are not permitted, to alter however alarming
or pessimistic the language of the communiques may be.
7* Fortunately there are, as the Director-General of the 3.3.C.
points out, means whereby the effect on the public mind of the
communication of unpleasant and alarming news may be to a cons id.erable
extent controlled. The impact of a piece of bad news on the
mind depends largely on the manner of its communication. The
important factors are :1*
The place at which it is introduced, in the general
narrative5 firsts last or in the middle.
2 . The context.
3. The words in which it is conveyed; to say that a
plane has "crashed"" is much more alarming than to
say that it has "failed to return".
U* The tone and emphasis of the speaker.
5* The extent to which the details are dwelt upon.
6 . Its reiteration.
I venture to think that by skilful attention to these matters
it should be possible to reconcile the requirements of candour with
the avoidance of -pessimism, and I propose to consider with the
Director-General the adaption of methods and formulae of announcement
which may aid. in achieving this result.
8. With regard to the emphasis to be laid upon barbaric methods
of warfare used by the Germans, it appears to me that a distinction
must be drawn between the importance of this factor for home purposes
and its importance for purposes of propaganda in other countries.
doubt whether it is desirable or indeed, consistent with the objects
I have dealt with above, that this theme should be enlarged, upon
for home consumption at present. The desirability of alluding to
it in those quarters abroad, from which we wish to obtain shipping
facilities is a matter on which I should like guidance; it is
plainly unwise to frighten neutral shipping from our shores. In
news broadcast to countries not affected, by these considerations, I
agree that the most ought to be made of this theme; and my office
and the Admiralty are now jointly drawing up an indictment of German
Practices for wide dissemination. I may say that the B..B.C. are
already paying very considerable attention to these issues in^their
foreign broadcasts4 varying their method of approach in accordance
With the characteristics of the countries they are addressing. But
I

- 3 it
Is obvious that any material divergence between the 5.3.0.'s
home news and its overseas news will quickly be noticed and will
adversely affect the reputation of both services.
9 . I have had the advantage of discussing the subject with the
First Lord of the Admiralty to whom I sent the olraft of this
Memorandum. As he informed me that he remained definitely in
favour of the weekly publication of shipping losses and proposed,
to embody his views in a separate Memorandum, I have thought it
best to present this Memorandum independently to the War Cabinet
so that both views might be before them when coming to a decision.

i SECRET
N O T E S
BY
THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION
ON
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF SHIPPING LOSSES IN THE 1131 S BULLETIN.
1. We regret very much that the First Lord of the Admiralty
should have formed the opinion that B.B.C. Nevs Bulletins are
marked by "unrelieved pessimism" and that they "unfailingly
open with a long account of ships sunk" I attach the script of
the particular broadcast at 9 p.m. on 1 6 t h December to which the
First Lord drew attention. It will be seen that the four items,
amounting to 2 0 lines in all, which the First Lord has put
together, were in fact given in two pairs separated by a
considerable interval, in a bulletin which began with 5 6 lines
about the Graf Spee, and ran altogether to 1 7 9 lines.
2 . On all naval matters our News Department is, of course
in close and detailed touch with the haval Intelligence Divisi 9
.on
of the Admiralty and as regards the particular items:(
i) The first (DUCHESS) was consequential upon the
earlier annoioncement that the DUCHESS had been sunk, without news
of the casualties; the phrase "their relatives have been
informed" being of course designed to set the minds of all other
relatives at rest.
(ii) The item about the laying of German mines was put
in at the formal request of the Admiralty, in order to warn ships
of danger.
(iii) The item about the sinking of neutral ships is in
accordance with the repeated request of the Admiralty that
attention should be drawn to the barbarity of German methods of
sea warfare.
3 . We fully appreciate the anxiety expressed by the First
Lord, and we are most anxious to do all we can to minimise the
effect of bad news upon the public morale, not only for sailors
but for all sections of the community. (It was largely with this
end in view that we felt bound to resist the Admiralty's request
that we should broadcast lists of the names of survivors from
particular engagements.) Our constant endeavour is to keep
losses strictly in their proper perspective in our bulletins, and
to avoid any dramatic writing-up or the broadcasting of any
unnecessary details. Continuous and careful study is given to
choice of words, order of items etc. in the presentation of the
news. But it has to be remembered that many of the items are
official communiques which we are not at liberty to alter.
lx. I have also had a letter from the Secretary of the
Admiralty (M. 0 1 6 9 7 1 / 3 9 of 2 0 t h December 1 9 3 9 ) , formally
requesting "that announcements of sinkings over the wireless

should "be confined to those cases where there is some special
news interest", notwithstanding that news of all losses"would
continue to be released to the news agencies and the press as and
when it was received,, I am also informed that the First Lord
has suggested that it would be sufficient if shipping losses
were broadcast once a week only. The issues thus raised are so
important that the counter considerations must be fully stated.
(i) It is essential on every ground to maintain the
present national reputation for frankness in telling both good
news and bad. To injure it would be equivalent to a major defeat
at sea or in the field. We interpret our task as a news service
in the light of the repeated declarations of the Government on
the supreme importance of truthfulness and objectivity;
particularly the pledge which the Prime Minister himself gave in
his broadcast on November 26th, when he said:"
Of one thing you can be sure. We shall not follow
the German example of either concealing our own
losses from you or of inventing enemy losses which
do not existc We told you of the loss of the
Courageous and the Royal Oak,, and you have just
heard of the sinking of the Rawlpindi. None of
these losses affects our overwhelming Naval
superiority, but we shall tell you. frankly what
is happening even when the truth is unpleasant,
and we shall never refrain from publishing news
except when it would be helpful to the enemy to have it"
(ii) In present world conditions the B.B.O. has a vital
part to play in the maintenance of our nations reputation for
truthfulness, both at home and abroad, At home there is
abundant evidence that the broadcast word is believed in preference
to many newspaper reports; and worldwide and overwhelming
evidence reaches the B.B.C. daily from abroad to the effect that
our news bulletins (in spite of possible failings in the way of
dulness) are looked to as the main source of information if the
truth is wanted.
(iii) Any attempt to supress or omit material news in
the British broadcast service, where such news is freely available
through other sources, would at once defeat itself, Not merely
the German broadcast services but scores of others would put the
news out in an hour or two. Whenever, for example, one of our
ships was sunk, Lord Haw Haw would have the monopoly of the story
all over the world for perhaps a full week.
(iv) The suggested policy would, inevitably lead to news
bulletins from foreign countries being more widely listened to and
more fully believed than at present, not only by the enemy and
neutrals but by our own people. The protective value which
prompt and truthful news through the E.3.,.C exerts against false
or misleading foreign bulletins would be destroyed.,
(v.) To adopt the course suggested, would greatly
increase the spread of alarming rumours and. secure credence for
them.
These arguments appear to us to render most inexpedient
the suggestions of the Admiralty which not only would be
ineffective but would also, in our opinion, be highly detrimental
to the national interest and morale.

5. At the same ti ie we are naturally most anxious to do all
we can to meet the general criticisms raised, and I hope that
steps which we have already taken may he found to he effective.
We have now arranged that losses at sea should not ordinarily
he included in the index of items with which each of our news
"bulletins opens. We have further decided that the repetition
of such items in successive bulletins should be reduced to a
minimum; - in spite of the fact that our several bulletins
are timed for substantially different audiences and that many
listeners, v/ho can only hear perhaps one or two bulletins
a day, may miss the item and may therefore charge us with
having suppressed the news. In addition, instructions have
been given that a specially vigilant watch should be kept
against the inclusion of unnecessary details in announcements
of this kind. Should these measures be found in practice not
to have entirely met the points now raised, or should the
Admiralty at anytime have other suggestions to make we shall of
course be glad to discuss them at any time.

9 o'clock News.
16th December, 1939.
Here is the news.
The GRA^" SPEE must leave Montevideo by tomorrow
night: she may leave before. Her British adversaries have
: been honoured by the King.
News of the sea and air includes an account of how
the R.A.F.. helps in mine-sweeping.
Count Ciano has spoken on Italian policy.
News of today'S Sport will be followed by a recorded
. account of the work of the Women's Royal Naval Service.
World-wide attention is focussed this weekend on
the next move by Germany's "pocketed" battleship, the
ADMIRAL GRAF SPEE. The next episode is expected any time
between now and, roughly, this time tomorrow night when the
72-hour limit set by Uruguay on the GRAF SPEE's stay in ,
Montevideo harbour is believed to expire. Then she must
either put to sea or submit to internment for the rest of the
war.
Ever since the GRAF SPEE entered the harbour,
battered and scarred, British warships have kept constant
guard over the wide estuary of the River Plate. Exactly
how strong their force is has not been disclosed; but it
has been described as "powerful", and one Agency message
says it includes one battleship, one battle cruiser, an
aircraft carrier and three cruisers, plus the big French
battleship DUNKERQUE..
While opinion is grov/ing in Montevideo that the
GRAF SPEE will steam out to meet her adversaries during the
coming night, a report has been broadcast from Rome that cne
of her sister ships - the ADMIRAL SCHEER - is sailing towards
the River Plate with an escort of submarines.
Just over an hour ago a Reuter message from
Uruguay described the GRAF SPEE as "nearly ready for a
spectacular attempt at an escape". Repairs to her hull and
super-structure have hastily been pushed ahead throughout the
day, and many tons of steel plate have been used to fill
gaping holes close to the v/ater line. Fuel and foodstuffs
have been taken aboard.
There is some speculation as to whether the Germans
will again fire the first shot if they attempt an escape, for
it was they whose fire began the battle which finally drove
them into a neutral port.
It became known today that the British prisoners
released from the GRAF SPEE included the' Chief Officer of the
Liverpool steamer HUNTSMAN, who has since cabled that all the
16 European members of her crew are safe and well.
The GRAF SPEE's commander has now told his story
of the battle, saying that the British gunners placed their
shells with geat accuracy and that the British cruisers made
"incredible manoeuvres" and showed "inconceivable audacity",
' J
It has just been announced by the Admiralty that
Commodore H. H. Harwood has been given the K.C.B. in
recognition of the gallant and successful action, fought by
the cruisers AJAX (which he was aboard) ACHILLES AND EXETER
The three captains - W. V/. E. Parry (ACHILLES) C. H. L.
Woodhouse (AJAX) and F, S. Bell (EXETER) have been appointed
Companions of the same Order,
Commodore Harwood has also been promoted tc be a
Rear-Admiral from the date of the action, and the Admiralty
have asked him for recommendations in respect of "the good
conduct and forwardness in action" of the officers and men
in the. squadron under his command.
An announcement by the Admiralty today gives names
of six officers and one hundred and twenty-three ratings
missing and believed to have been drowned when the destroyer
DUCHESS sank after the collision announced two; days ago.
Their relatives have been informed.
The list is believed to be complete.
The only survivors were one officer and twenty-two
ratings.
The Admiralty'announced this evening that; an area
off the mouths of the rivers Tyne and Tees has-been made
dangerous' to navigation by German mines. The exact
positions defining this area were broadcast at six o'clock,
and will be read again at midnight.
The resource and initiative shown by. the Royal Air
Force in helping to clear the seas of enemy mines is shown
in a story reaching us tonight of a coastal command aircraft
in the North Sea., which saved several home-bound merchant
vessels from damage by mines.
The machine was flying high over the North Sea jus
before dusk, when the front gunner noticed two black specks
on the water. He knew that they were minesf and they lay
in a fairway used daily by ships passing to and from Englis
ports. The mines were some distance apart, and the failin
light made it difficult to destroy them, from the air. He
set off to find mine-swecpsrs which be had seen close by.
He called them with lamp signals, and guided them to the
mines - which they dealt with by gunfire.
The pilot consulted his watch. It was just an
hour since he had sighted the mines.
An hour later the first of the on-coming merchant
ships reached the spot and passed in safety, quite unaware
of the desperate measures that had been taken to safeguard
her passage.
The ration allowance for soldiers and sailors on
leave has been increased from 2/3 d, to 2/6d0 a day. This
was announced by the "Jar Office and Admiralty today.
Today's news of the scuttling of the two and a
half thousand ton German merchant ship TENERIFFE brings
Germany's wartime losses of merchant vessels to thirty-nine.
The five thousand ton Greek steamer GERMAINE was
sunk in the Atlantic yesterday while on her way to Eire with
a cargo of maize. Hex1 crew was picked up by two Dutch
ships. Three ether neutral losses yesterday were the
Norwegian steamers RAGNI and E.0, FLOOD, and the small
Swedish ship URSUS.,
The Liverpool tanker ATHELTEMPLAR, mined in the
North Sea yesterday, has now been salved and. brought into
port by tugs; while the mined Dublin tanker INVERLAINE has
drifted on to a beach on the ..orth easx coast, Five men are
missing from the two ships.
In Rome today Count Ciano made an important speech
on Italian policy. The Duce was among his listeners.
The Italian Foreign Minister first dealt with evenlg)
leading up to the war, and expressed the general surprise that
had been felt when the Russo-German Pact was signed. He even
suggested that the British and French approach to Russia
earlier in the year might have contributed to the unexpected
result.
Count Ciano recalled the war in Spain, Italy's
support of Franco, the setting up of the Rome-Borlin-Axis, and
the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Speaking critically
of communism he pointed out that Signor Mussolini had been the
first to fight it - in the streets of Rome; but Count Ciano
did not refer to the Red invasion of Finland. The Italian
Foreign Minister indeed claimed that Italy had prevented the
war from spreading by declaring herself non-belligerent on the
day that Poland was invaded. He denied that this was due to
Italian un-preparedness for war and added that no pressure had
been put vn Italy to stay out of the conflict.
Turning to the Balkans, Count Ciano, spoke of Italy's
friendship for Jugoslavia and Hungary, and said that a Balkan
Bloc was not the way to maintain peace in south-eastern Europe.
Italy, said Cunt Ciano, would watch with sympathy the efforts
of Balkan countries to solve questions outstanding between
themselves, but would herself remain rigidly neutral.
Russia apparently will take no notice of all of the
direct appeal for re-opening negotiations which the Finnish
Foreign Minister broadcast in Russian last night. The Soviet
Foreign Office said they had "no knowledge" of the broadcast,
and the Red press don't even mention it.
All Russian attempts to gain ground in Finland have
been repulsed, according to the Finnish army communique issued
tonight, except in the Petsamo region of the far north. Here
the Reds claim the capture of the nickel town which they were
attacking and the Finns in their turn admit a retreat.
Reports from Luxembourg state that a violent
artillery battle was heard there this morning. There was
continuous gunfire from 5 o'clock until dawn. The Germans
were shelling to the south of the Franco-Luxembourg frontier.
French artillery retaliated in the region east of the Moselle.
Big guns in the Maginot and Siegfried Lines fired at
one another's emplacements across the Rhine for several hours
this morning.

Mr. Chamberlain has had a busy day in Prance.
This morning he inspected a foundry where material is being
made for pill-boxes and duck-boards, and saw a number of
block-houses, traps designed to catch tanks, trenches, wire
entanglements and gun positions,
"Thank you," he called out, "good luck to you and
a merry Christmas," as the troops recognised him and saluted
him.
After lunch he drove to a Royal Air Eorce aerodrome,
where he inspected English, Scottish and Irish troops. In
the aerodrome they showed him a piece of metal from the first
n
Heinkel 'plane brought down by this squadron. e accepted a
cartridge case as a souvenir.

Here are a few points from today;s Regional League
tournament matches.
Arsenal are still the only unbeaten club. Today
they beat Southend United by five goals to one and lead the
South A Section with sixteen points.
Bournemouth United have lost their place at the top
of the South B Table. They drew 2-all with Chelsea, whereas
Reading, v/ho were second, beat Portsmouth 2-1. Reading and
Bournemouth both have 13 points, but Reading take first place
because they have a better goal average.
The leading positions in the Midland Table are
unchanged. West Bromwich Albion beat Coventry 3-1 and are
still at the top with 1h points.
Plymouth Argylo and Swindon Town both lost today but
still hold first and second places in the South Western Group.
Plymouth were beaten 1-0 by Bristol City, and Swindon lost 5-1
at Torquay. Both clubs have 12 points, but Plymouth are
placed first on goal average.
No fewer than 212 goals were scored in today's
Regional,-Gup and Friendly matches. Of the 86 teams only'
nine did not score a goal.
