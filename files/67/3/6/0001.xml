The Censorship of Outward Mails-
Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare,
1. It will be recollected that at their Meeting on October
l+th, last, the War Cabinet deci"\id -"-hat mails on board vessels
inward bound to Europe should be subjected to a thorough
examination and that neutral Governments should be notified
accordingly (W.M. (39) 36th conclusions). No similar decision
was taken regarding mails on vessels outward bound fl?om European
ports, partly because the necessary organization in the Censorship
Department was not yet sufficiently advanced, but mainly
because there was some uncertainty whether adequate legal ground
could be found for doing so in the absence of a policy of
intercepting enemy exports. One of the principal difficulties
in this respect was that, in the absence of such a policy, it
was at least doubtful whether there was any ground for causing
outward bound ships to come to British ports at all, where alone
the necessary examination could be carried out. It would in
consequence have been necessary to bring such ships in on the
sole ground that they might be carrying enemy propaganda whicft
oould be treated as an analogue of contraband, and this would
certainly have led to serious protest from neutrals.
2 . With the recent decision to intercept enemy exports
the legal difficulty has disappeared. All outward bound vessels
will be required to come into a contraband control base for
examination of their cargoes, and just as mails on inward!
vessels are searched for contraband so can mails on outward
vessels be searched for goods of enemy origin or ownership,
including of course drafts, securities or propagandist
literature/

literature. The general legal position regarding the. examination
of mails was set out in the Memorandum circulated to the Cabinet
on October 3 r d . In the circumstances which have now arisen, we
could justify the examination of outward mails on the same broad
ground as for inward mails, namely that mails may contain matter
which, in the exercise of our belligerent rights, we are entitled
to detain or seize.
3 . I need not lay stress on the extreme importance of examining
outward mails, which, from a blockade standpoint, proved in the last
war to be the most valuable of all our sources of information.
This material is needed not only to enable the details of enemy
commercial transactions to be traced but also to enable adequate
evidence i.n support of detentions or seizures to be made, available,
to the Contraband and Enemy Exports Committees, and to the Prize
Court. At present, only half the story is available and this
needs to be completed by an examination of outward going mail.
k- Needless to say, this decision will still give rise to
serious complaints from neutrals. The decision to interfere with
German exports, will, for example, necessitate a revision of the
arrangements made with Italy by which we undertook that their
mail steamers should not be detained when outward bound for the
U.S.A. Owing to the difficulties of unloading cargo at
Gibraltar, it will be necessary to devise some new arrangements,
which will preclude the diversion of these steamers to French
ports, and in the meanwhile any examination of cargo will have
to be somewhat perfunctory. It will be essential therefore,
if mail is to be examined, that the Gibraltar Censorship.should
be sufficiently equipped to enable the mails to be searched and
the ships released within twenty-four hours.
5 . The Censorship Department attach great importance to
examining outward mails for the reasons given in the attached
extracts from a,Memorandum-by--the Deputy Chief Postal Censor.

It is understood that they have now the organisation to--do so,
but it is of course essential that this should he the case, bathin
the United Kingdom and at bases in the Mediterranean, owing
to the necessity for speed.

November 27th, 1939-Extract
-from Memorandum "by Deputy Chief
Postal Censor.
1. The announced policy of the suppression of
enemy trade can only he executed if outward mails are
censored. Such trade will in future be carried on, as
it is to a large extent being carried on at present,
through elaborate subterfuges and devices for concealment,
including tOclX fully drawn false manifests, and sometimes
covering four or five countries in their operation. The
papers covering cargoes and the correspondence revealing
the enemy interest in them will only be found in the
outward mails.
2. The outward mails are also likely to contain
securities and means of payment in process of realisation
on behalf of the enemy.
3. There is evidence that they, further, contain
great masses of printed propaganda addressed to all parts
of the world, and some of which is proving regrettably
effective. The following is a typical example of the
evidence accumulating on this point.
(Letter from German agent in Chile).
"The Fuehrer's speech in the Reichstag, Goering's
speech and the Danzig speech, all these were in
the shortest possible time sent over to us in
German rnd immediately translated into Spanish,
English, Portuguese, etc., so that the people
here are in direct touch v/ith Germany and get
everything before others can put their own
interpretations on it it really works
a treat."
h. A search of the outward mails may be expected
to reveal correspondence from direct or concealed enemy
sources to enemy agents in North and South America, and
other
