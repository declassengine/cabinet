PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING BRITISH Y/AR TIME PROPAGANDA.
Note by the Minister of Information.
1. I circulate herewith a Memorandum in which I
have endeavoured to set out the principles which I conceive
should direct and inspire British propaganda in this war.
We can only hope to defeat the machinations of Dr. Goebbels?
and to make the fullest possible use of propaganda as an
essential Arm of Defence, if the Ministry of Information
is able to relate the whole of its activities to a single
coherent and planned policy.
2. I, therefore, seek the approval of the War
Cabinet in general terms for the principles indicated in
the attached paper. With one exception, noted in subparagraph
(iv) below, there is, I think, nothing particularly
controversial in what I propose, but I would draw
the attention of the Cabinet to the following points:
(i) This Memorandum is not in itself a plan of
campaign, but a formulation of a general policy
designed to inspire and coordinate all the
activities of the Ministry,
(ii) The general policy will be fundamentally the
same for the Home, the Empire and the Foreign
fronts alike. But its practical application
will vary in each case.
(iii) The task of the propagandist would be immensely
lightened If it were possible to relate our
War-effort to a declaration of peace-aims which
would be generally acceptable.
(iv) It would be of great assistance to me if His
Majesty's Government were to approve the
declaration set out in paragraph 12 of the \
Memorandum , namely that "With the German who
accepts the essential principles set out in
this Memorandum we have no quarrel, but the
German nation under its existing rulers does
not accept them and until it does so there can
be no .peace or security for the world.

PROPAGANDA
Propaganda must not be content to be negative and defens
to b e successful it must be positive and creative. It must
b e capable of rou.sin^ the whole nation and inspiring them
with devotion to the national cause, It must be able to
represent that cause as a crusade, for which no sacrifice is
too great.
Our purpose is to defeat Germany in war. Propaganda is
needed to show why this is necessary.
Propaganda should empahsise clearly;(
a) What we are seeking to defeat,,
( b ) What we are seeking to preserve and create.
These objects can best be attained by concentration
-upon the themes
X, What Britain is fighting forc
11* How Britain fights0
1 1 1 * The need for sacrifice if the fight Is to be won
I. What Britain is fighting for
The Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, and other
members of H. Li. Government have repeatedly made it plain that
the objects for which we and our Allies are fighting are to
destroy the rule of the Nazis, to safeguard Europe from the
recurring fear of German aggression, and thereby to promote
a better order in Europe and in the world, generally. But
essential as it is that these should be constantly emphasised
something more is required for the propagandist. British
propaganda should therefore work upon two basic themes;(
a ) Britain is in danger; other countries in the Empire and
elsewhere are also in danger.
( b ) What Britain stands for is in danger.
( a ) The main objects of the theme Britain in danger are;(
1 ) To counter the false sense of security which our
immunity from attack during the first four months
of the war has engendered.
(ii) To rally British morale and effort and to induce a
truer and more sober1 estimate of what the war means
directly to this country in, e.g. the military,
social and economic spheres.

3 L&amp;A
(iii) To conviiico foreign opinion that G-reat Britain is
fighting the war in earnest.
(h) What Britain stands for is in danger
(i) The immediate object of propaganda for this purpose
should he to make clear in a concrete form the way
of life and the human values to which Nazi theory and
practice are inimical, This should he illustrated
not only or chiefly from our own country hut from the
life and institutions of the Empire, of Frances the
Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium
and the Uo S
(ii) Propaganda can r:?ell he used as an instrument to create
and not merely to destroy mutual esteem and understanding
between nations. In order to achieve this
wider object propaganda must be raised to a higher
levels
As in the material, so in the spiritual, sphere Britain
is in dangero She is joint trustee of Western civilisation^
She is at one with all nations of good faith in the defence of
the common heritage,? Her cause is their cause.
To transform these conceptions into vivid realities in
the minds of the peoples of Great Britain, of the Empire, of
Europe, and of the world at large is the supreme task of
British war-time propaganda,.
Any attempt to define what we want to preserve either in
terms of "civilisation11 or in terms of "Christianity" must face
the difficulty that a major social change is evidently in progress
of which both Nazi and Communist revolutions are morbid
symptomso The question is not whether the old order shall
prevail over the new, but whether the new order shall be based
on the Christian Ethic, the scientific spirit, and the rule of
lav;, upon which Western Civilisation has been chiefly built.
Propaganda should therefore be directed towards representing
every social and economic upheaval which the war involves not
as an inconvenience but as an opportunity.
In order to ensure that transition from the old order
does not involve the destruction of Civilisation, propaganda
should be concentrated irponr(
a) The sanctity of absolute values
(b) The sanctity of the individual and of the family,
(c) The comity of natienso
-(-a) The sanctity of absolute^ values.
Western Civilisation has been built upon the sanctity of
absolute values,-, It has been generally accepted that certain
abstract conceptions are the absolute standards of
human life0 Such concepts as good, right, truth, and
beauty are the ultimate values that give life meaning.
The Nazis, logically developing a school of German thought,
have denied this basis of civilisation. For them right
is folk-right, truth is German truth, good is party-good.
Ends become meanso

( b ) The s a n c t i t y of t h e individual and of the family
The sanctity of the individual and of the family is a
cardinal principle of Western Civilisation and outlook
on life. "This is the source from which flow the rights
o f liberty of conscience, freedom from arbitrary arrest
and imprisonment, free expression of opinion, impartial
l aw and t h e other great instruments whereby individual
freedom is reconciled with social order. These things
t h e N a z i s genuinely despise. They have erected the folkstate
as an absolute. According to this heresy man exists
for the State, not the State for man.
( G ) The comity of nations
Just as the sanctity of the individual is completed in
t h a t of t h e family, so are the security and independence
of s t a t e s realised in the comity of nations. Each
civilised nation s e e k s the good life for itself. And as
the good life is expressed in the common good, so does
t h e nation find its highest expression in the comity of
nations. But the totalitarian folk-state is absolute
externally as w e l l as internally. The doctrine of the
dominant German race is fundamentally inconsistent with
t h e doctrine o f international rights, no less than with
the sanctity of the individual. All nations are therefore
potential victims. All aggression is justified. This
i s the proclamation of the lav/ of the jungle. No treaty
and no guarantee given by the Nazi Government can be relied
upon i f it should be thought that it will suit German
interests to b r e a k their word. So long as Nazism remains
undefeated, the rest of Europe will be compelled to live
i n constant f e a r of German aggression.
"Humane and pacifist ideas may perhaps be quite good
when the man of highest value has so completely conquered
and subjected the world that he is sole lord of the earth0
Therefore first battle, and then possibly pacifism".
(Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, )
With the German who accepts the essential principles
s e t out i n this Memorandum we have no quarrel, but the German
nation under its existing rulers does not accept them and until
i t does so there can be no peace or security for the world.
II, How Britain fights
.British propaganda should, and does, describe how Britain
fights, and with what success, not less than it proclaims what
she is fighting for. The continuous service of news, topical
comment, films, broadcasts, photographs, articles, etc., should
he maintained and extended. It is the question of treatment and
showmanship that is here of cardinal importance - here and
everywhere else, for the ideas suggested above are valueless
as propaganda unless they are presented and advocated by
experts who know now to make the heart beat faster
c

- Ur -
Great Britain must be represented as fighting Germany on
land, in the air, and at sea, ceaselessly, without remorse, with
all her armed might, with financial resources, industrial manpower,
and commercial assets, with all her idealism and determination.
If periods of inactivity are strategically necessary,
these very periods should be represented as fraught with
particular and purposeful significance.
III. The Need for Sacrifice if the fight is to be won.
There is still too much anxiety lest the war should impair
our present standards of living. Propaganda should seek to
bring home the magnitude of the issues at stake in comparison
with the sacrifices called for. It should be represented that
Britain will win by her great strength, but that the maintenance
of this strength calls for correspondingly great sacrifice. The
temporary lowering of the general standard of living should be
regarded not as something which the Government should be afraid
to ask and the public expected to resent, but as something to be
accepted willingly and proudly, as an essential contribution
to the success of the allied cause, A ringing call to selfdiscipline
and sacrifice would be the logical complement to
propaganda based upon fundamental issues. (M. Reynaudts reoent
speech in the Chamber of Deputies is a striking example of an
appeal of this kind).
It would seem that only by means of an imaginative propaganda
campaign on the lines suggested in this note can Great
Britain and the Empire convince the world that their participation
in the war is but one element of the Allied design to
secure the foundation of a new and better \rorId-order.
