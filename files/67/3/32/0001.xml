WAR C A B I N E T.
TURKEY.
FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS.
Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Monsieur Human, the Secretary-General of the
Turkish Foreign Office, has come to London in the hope
of obtaining anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns which
the Turkish Government regard as essential for the
defence of Thrace and putting an end to the Suspensive
Clause in the Special Agreement. Having done this, it
was his intention to sign the three technical Financial
Agreements relating to the war material loan, the gold
loan and the loan for liquidating trade arrears.
2* The discussions on financial points may he
summarized as follows. Monsieur Human informed me that
Turkey does not propose to pay the service of the war
material credit of &#163; 2 5 million to the United Kingdom and
to France in pounds and in francs, hut in Turkish
currency to he used for the purchase of Turkish goods
which will he exported to the United Kingdom and to
France. When I pointed out to him that the Special
Agreement clearly involves an undertaking to meet the
service of this loan in cash, he replied that it has
always been understood between him and the British and
French Ambassadors that we would accept payment in goods
in the Bame way as Germany had always done.

3. It is certainly true that Turkey is most
unlikely to be either able or willing to meet the
service of this loan in cash, and it seems clearly
better for us to have the right to buy Turkish goods
rather than to be faced with a complete default.
Accordingly the Treasury informed monsieur Human that
I and the French Minister of Finance would be ready
to consider accepting the service of the loan in
Turkish currency on the condition that we obtain
satisfaction in regard to chrome. A draft agreement
indicating our desires about chrome was handed to
Monsieur Human: a copy is attached.
l\.m Monsieur Human replied that it is essential for
Turkey to sell sultanas, nuts and figs. Germany will
buy these only if Turkey also sells her chrome and
accordingly, if we want all the chrome, we must take
1+0,000 tons of sultanas, 12,000 tons of nuts and
10,000 tons of figs for the duration of the war, These
would cost about &#163;2 million a year.
5. I understand that the Ministry of Food think it
would be impossible to sell any of the figs, or more
than 10,000 tons of sultanas, or 2,000 tons of nuts,
unless they were able to lower the retail price
substartially0 The subsidy would have to be substantial,
and the resulting loss would be great. They think,
however, that if the subsidy were sufficient it might
just be possible to dispose of between 20 and 25,000
tons of sultanas, 3,000 tons of figs and 5,000 tons of
nuts, provided that the quality was suitable, which is
probably a matter of doubt. The administrative
difficulties ivould be considerable, and great care would
have to be taken that any arrangements as regards price
did not disturb either the Empire or American producers

and exporters., (A dote "by the Ministry of Food is
annexed).,
6. From the financial point of view, no actual
expenditure would he involved by spending on sultanas,
nuts and. figs that part of the annuity which remains
over and above the amount required for the purchase of
chrome. But, of course, the loss to the Treasury
will b e much greater if we buy sultanas, nuts and figs
for which we have no use,, rather than copper, which we
need, or articles such as cotton, mohair, tanning
material, and olive oil, which are not perishable as
are fruits, and for which either a limited use can be
found or which can be held in reserve in the hope of
some later use or possibility of resaleS
7* Thus Monsieur Human's proposal to blackmail us
into taking sultanas etc by making this a condition of
carrying out the Agreement already reached in principle
in regard to chrome is extremely unacceptable both to
the Ministry of Food and to the Treasury., At the same
time we are bound to incur a very heavy loss on that
part of the annuity which we accept in the form of
Turkish goods other than chrome, and on political grounds
there is no doubt a good deal.to be said for agreeing to
spend this portion of the annuity on sultanas, nuts and
figs. We should not, I think, give a definite undertaking
to purchase the specific quantities desired by
Monsieur human, because the cost would be considerably
more than the available part of the annuity and we should
certainly be charged very excessive prices once we agree
to purchase fixed quantities. It is, however, for
consideration whether we should not agree to purchase
3 6
Most of the chrome will in any case be
purchased for sterling under the
arrangements made as regards the previous
credits to Turkey
n

sultanas, nuts and. figs with that part of the annuity
available after the purchase of chrome on the following
conditions
(l) that .the Chrome Agreement is signed, and that
Turkish exports of other essential goods to
Germany are restricted.
(2) that the sultanas etc.. are offered at reasonable
prices, of satisfactory quality, and properly
packed.
8. If it is decided to grant this additional favour
to Turkey, we ought to stipulate that various small but
troublesome financial claims are satisfactorily met. It
would also be very desirable to stipulate that instead of
being obliged to send &#163;15 million in gold to Ankara - which
is a very troublesome and expensive and quite useless
process55 - we should be allowed to deliver the gold in
London anek in Paris,
9. A further point raised, by Monsieur Numan was that
he desired that we should, at once purchase tobacco to the
value of the annuity on the gold loan and the trade arrears
loan, and should at once purchase sultanas etc, in connection.;
with the service of the war materials loan. Monsieur Numan
said that the Turkish budget could not produce the Turkish
currency required in advance of the dates on which the
annuity instalments would be due and that the Turkish
Central Bank could not make an advance to the Turkish
Treasury unless the advance were secured by gold. He
therefore suggested that the Bank of England should lend the

safely would be to send at least two cruisers.

f j o h*
gold, to the Turkish Central Bank to serve as cover for these
advances amounting in all to some &#163;3 million. This would
immoholise the gold reserves of ourselves and France to that
extent. It would he perfectly easy for the Turkish
Government to pledge &#163;3 million out of the &#163;15 million of
gold which we are handing over to them, and I think that
we should insist on this unless, in return, we can get them
to agree that the gold should he delivered in London and Paris
instead of in Ankara.
1 0 . Monsieur Numan has said that he must leave London
at latest on Wednesday for Paris and return to Turkey at the
end of the week. He therefore pressed very strongly that
he should receive a reply immediately. If the Cabinet
agree that the reply should be on the lines suggested above,
we shall then have to consult the French Government, but
it might be just possible to let Minsieur Numan have a reply
by Tuesday.

ANNEX II.
PURCHASES OF TURKISH PRODUCE.
SULTANAS.
The Ministry of Food considers it impossible to
dispose of k 0 , 0 0 0 tons of Turkish fruit. It estimates
that perhaps as high as h o per cent of the Turkish stocks
will he of a quality below the standard of United
Kingdom requirements. The Ministry considers that
1 0 , 0 0 0 tons might be disposed of if the purchase price
were reasonable, i.e. if &#163; 2 0 a ton in place or the
Turkish asked price of approximately &#163;28 a ton. An
additional 1 5 , 0 0 0 tons might conceivably be disposed
of if, b y subsidy, the retail price and the export
price from the United Kingdom were reduced. . The
attempt to force exports, however, might lead to some
friction with the United States of America from which,
at the moment, no purchases of sultanas are being made,
and which is itself faced with a heavy surplus.
Negotiations for the Australian and South
Africa:::, crops are at the point of commencement. If
the price paid is increased in proportion to the recent
rise in the Turkish asked price, the increased payments
involved will amount to over &#163; 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 . Therefore,
the payment of the Turkish asked price carries with it
a risk of still further losses unless the Empire
producers can be induced to accept an tinchanged price.
FIGS.
The Ministry already is faced with a surplus
over normal annual requirements as a result of its

previous purchases of Turkish figs. The normal
consumption in the United Kingdom is 6 , 0 0 0 tons, and to
purchase a further 1 0 , 0 0 0 tons would result in a surplus
equivalent to two years' consumption of a rapidly
perishable commodity-.. The Liinistrs" estimates that at
a subsidised price possibly an extra 3 , 0 0 0 tons might
be consumed.
HAZEL NUTS.
The total annual imports into the United Kingdom
from all sources is approximately h , 0 0 0 tons, The
Ministry of Food does not at the moment purchase any nuts
on its own account, but permits unrestricted imports.
The suggested purchase of 1 2 , 0 0 0 tons represents so
large an increase over total consumption that it is
difficult to see what can be done with them. It is
possible that by encouraging the use of nuts for
confectionery, an additional 2 , 0 0 0 tons might be absorbed,
and. other uses might possibly be found for an additional
3 , 0 0 0 tons.
To sum up, it seems likely that at a subsidised
price slightly over half of the Turkish produce might be
marketed, involving a loss of probably more than half of
the purchase price asked by Turkey. This is a rough
estimate which might be falsified by events, but in view
of the quantities offered and the price asked, it is
certain that the loss will be substantial.
