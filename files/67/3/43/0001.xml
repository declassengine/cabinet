THE SHIPPING SITUATION.
Note by the Minister of Shipping.
The Government v/ill be faced with a series of problems
arising from the contraction of our imported supplies. In
order that these may each be seen in a true perspective, a
survey of the shipping position as a whole on which they all
depend is essential. I therefore submit a general review of
this situation as it appears after three months of war.
A.
SUMMARY.
It may be convenient if I summarise at once the main
points.
1. Losses.
We were in this period comparatively fortunate. The net
loss, setting captures and new building against sinkings, marine
losses, vessels long overdue, etc., up till 3rd December 1939
was only 135,000 tons gross. Losses from submarine attack and
mines were no higher than previous experience suggested as
probable. We lost little from raiders, nothing from air
bombing at sea or in port; and did not suffer the great
dislocation which would result from intensive air attack on the
ports and inland communications.
These forms of attack may still become serious, even if
those which we have already suffered are not intensified.
- Reduction of Imports.
Nevertheless imports foil by UO^ - to about 9 million
tons (excluding oil) for the three months as compared with a
peacetime average of 15 million tons.
2

3. reuses of Shortage.
Actual sinkings of cargo (compensated, by captured and
comdemned cargo) and of ships (largely offset by captures and
new building) have so far played a very small part in the
reduction of imports.
The reduction is due:(
a) To the withdrawal of ships for Naval and Military work,
which has required (apart- from tankers) about 2 million
gross tons.
(b) To the delays resulting from the convoy system and
precautionary measures affecting navigation, many of which
are inevitable and permanent. These have reduced importing
capacity by over 3O/0, and on some important routes by much
more. The Iron Ore programme has suffered particularly
from this cause.
(c) To the fall of imports in neutral ships, which normally
bring about 23 mill ion tons of our imports, other than oil, and
in the three months have brought in little more than 50&#163; of
the usual quantities (3m. tons as compared with 5f million tons).
The turn-round of neutral shipping is being most adversely
affected by the delays arising from the control of
contraband.
(d) To the paralysis of markets at the onset of the crisis.
4. Analysis of British Tonnage.
Deducting vessels withdrawn for combatant service, and
others not available for such work, we have only 10,470,000
gross tons of British ships for long distance overseas work.
All but 670,000 gross tons of this total (which is thus our
last and small reserve, and is already being reduced by
diversions to the UsK, trade) is engaged in importing service.
Our imports from distant sources therefore depend upon
9,800,000 gross tons of British ships, to which we may add
imports in smaller ships from near sources and imports in
neutral tonnage and from which v/e must deduct tonnage in and
required for the service of France.
5- Prospective Imports
a
On November 15th I estimated our total imports (excluding
oil) for the first year at 47 million tons (as compared with
peace imports of 60 million tons), on the assumption of no
increase of losses and delays.

That was before the intensive mine attack bagan on
November 18th. Imports for the first quarter, however, were
only at the rate of 36 million tons per annum, and naturally
will have included many commodities not essential to the
conduct of the war or allowed for in a 47 million ton programme.
It is disturbing that, during this period, our small
stocks of vital commodities have been seriously diminished.
6. What Shipping Control can do.
We can gradually bring the British ships in foreign trade
into importing work, and in so far as exchange difficulties
- allow, concentrate more upon shorter routes. We can slowly
increase building if it were practicable to allot a higher
proportion of the yards to merchant vessels. We can secure
neutral ships.
All these measures are expensive and slow; their effect
is only gradully felt and it is limited in total.
7. What economies in imported supplies can do.
The main adjustment to shortage of shipping must be found
in restricted consumption and the use of substitutes.
In 1917 we had a much greater military demand on our
tonnage, which was at that time even less than at present.
But no military action or vital service was impeded, even
though our imports (excluding oil) were only 34 million tons in
that year as compared with 52 million tons in 1913. (This
compares with 60 million tons for 1938, when our population was
10% greater than in 1917.)
Cereal imports had been reduced from 11 million tons to
H (and yet stocks had been increased) and "timber and
manufactures" had come down from nearly 12 million tons to 3.
Disaster was avoided because the Supply Departments had
restricted consumption by rationing, dilution of bread, and by
use of home substitutes (especially home timber).

Advantage of. immediate economies.
If we delay in enforcing similar measures, we must expect
actual shortages which will paralyze production and perhaps cause
severe hardships imposed at short notice. If we act at once we may
hope at the worst to avoid such consequences, or at the best to
have some reserve which v/e can use, and. shall need, for an
increased war effort in whatever direction we choose.
- It must be remembered that we started the war with no stocks
of cereal feeding stuffs and with abnormally low stocks of timber.
Effect on morale.
If actual stocks of vital supplies in this country are allowed
to run out, the measures which we shall be compelled to adopt will
assume a "panic" character which will encourage the enemy and
impair our own morale. If we now require economy in order to ensure
against the future hazards of war and to increase the scale of our
v/ar effort, we mar/ hope that the effect will be precisely the
opposite.
It is, I would urge, impossible to expect that, with tonnage
reduced in total oy withdrawals for combatant service and by losses,
and further reduced by one fifth or more - in some trades by much
more - in importing capacity through navigational delays; and with
the increasing need of raw materials for munitions, civilian
consumption can remain on peace levels, or Supply Departments rely
on the same proportion of imported, as against home-produced supplies.
B.
I will now analyse more fully the situation briefly
summarised above.
I.
Losses and Replacement.
That we have not suffered heavier losses in the first quarter
is due first to the efficiency of the R'avyfs protection, and in
Particular to the Immediate instittition of the convoy system and
o a
e improved methods of dealing with submarines. Enemy raiders destroyed
52 ships of over 500 gross tonnage of all
nationalities in the first five months of the last war. Mines,
which destroyed 39 ships over 500 ton gross in the last five
months of 1914, have not so far been much more destructive,
having in three months accounted for 44 ships, British and
foreign. More important still is the fact that we have lost
no ships by air bombing, either at sea or in port, or suffered
the great handicap to importing capacity which would result
from large scale bombing of the country. The fortunate immunity
in respect of the last forms of attack may not continue and all
supply arrangements must take, account of that fact.
As we stand, however, the account of losses and replacement
of British tonnage showed at the end of the quarter a net loss
of 135,000 tons, made up as follows:
(a) General tonnage. (b) Tankers.

Notes- In addition in the first three months of the war the
French Mercantile Marine have lost 8 cargo vessels of
41,000 gross tons and 1 tanker of 14,000 gross tons.
Neutrals lost 44 ships of 170,000 gross tons and
3 tankers of 15,000 gross tons.

Loss of Importing Capacity.
Our total imports (excluding oil) for the three months were
approximately 9 million tons as compared with our average
peacetime importation for the same period of 15 million tons a
reduction of 40 per cent.
The explanation is to be found mainly, not in losses, but
in three factors:(
a) The withdrawal of cargo-carrying ships for Naval
and Military work.
Apart from tankers, over two million tons, or about
one-sixth of the British tonnage norms.lly available for
long distance importing work, have been requisitioned. In
particular, 51 ships have been taken for Armed Merchant
Cruisers - many, though not all, of them good and fast
cargo carriers.
( b ) Delays inevitably resulting from the convoy system
and precautionary measures affecting navigation. These
delays have reduced importing capacity by over 30 per cent.,
and must at the best involve a reduction of 20 per cent.
to 25 per cent.
(c) The reduction to little more than a half of
imports in neutral ships, which are reluctant to come to
British ports, and whose crews are sometimes unwilling
to sail.
The present German policy is directed especially
1
to deterring neutrals, and though we have taken steps
(described later) to alleviate the position, we must
expect a continuing loss in this respect. It is neutral
tonnage that is being mainly hit by the delays due to the
control of contraband.

n-n Imports.
Oil imports during the first quarter of the war have
totalled 1 . 7 million tons, as compared -with the peacetime average
of 2 . 8 million tons per quarter.
The counteracting measures possible through the direction
of shipping (and their limitations both in time and extent) are
described below.
I I I .
Analysis of British Tonnage.
The total British shipping, as it appears in Lloyd's amounts
to about 2 1 million tons gross. In my memorandum of the
2 9 t h November ('7.P. (G) (39) 1 2 6 ) I analysed this figure and
showed how misleading it is, if we are reckoning the importing
capacity of British ships. One million tons consists of little
vessels under 5 0 0 tons; million tons of vessels on the
Great Lakes, river boats, tugs, dredgers and other craft not
available, for ocean work; and 1 million tons of vessels betv/een
500 and 1 , 6 0 0 tons; 2 million tons (apart from tankers) have
been required for the fighting services. Of this reduced total
&#163; million tons are passenger vessels with small cargo-carrying
capacity (12+6, ! 0 0 tons in the aggregate).
Moreover, there are about M; million tons, within the
remaining total, which are on the Dominion Registers. We can
obtain none of these ships except with the consent of the
Dominions and we cannot hope for much help from this source as
the Dominions have their own requirements.
The net result is that (excluding tankers) we have, in
ocean-going cargo-carrying tonnage:(
a) Vessels now importing .... 9 , 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 g.t.
(b) Cargo liners normally in
permanent trade between
foreign ports 670, 0 0 0 g.t.
This 6 7 0 , 0 0 0 tons is a l-eserve. It can be gradually brought
into direct trade with the United Aingdora, and the process has

already begun. But (apart from the fact that British goodwill
will tlrus be lost that may be irrecoverable after the war), we
shall thus lose earnings in foreign exchange, which are much
needed for the conduct of the war.
From the 9 . 8 million tons which are left, we still have
to allow for the extent to which we shall have to supplement
French tonnage for French needs. Provisionally I' allowed
350,000 tons for this purpose. This, however, is likely to
be exceeded. (in 19*17 the corresponding figure was much
higher.)
We are left, therefore, with a little over 9^ million
gross tons of British ocean-going tonnage immediately
available for the transport of commodities other than oil.
There is one other way in which importing capacity can
be increased. V/e can direct ships on to nearer routes,
e,g. by replacing wheat supplies from Australia by wheat
supplies from Forth America. This usually involves the
expenditure of dollars (as well as difficulties in some cases with
with an exporting Dominion.) It is necessarily a slow process.
Moreover, economies of this kind are offset by the necessity
1
of importing many supplies fro;.-, more distant sources, e.g.
timber from the Pacific coast of Canada instead of from the
Baltic.
As regards tankers, the arrangement with
Norwegian shipowners will help, but we have
also to reckon with the great increase in
consumption that would result from increased
military activity in France.
IV.
FOREIGN TONNAGE..
In 1937 about 23 million tons of imports were brought in
neutral ships. In the first three months of the war the rate.'.
Q f importation fell to about half.

With the war, American ships, which brought in about
1^- million tons a year in peace, apart from oil, have been
completely withdrawn from belligerent zones.
Dutch vessels, and still more Greek vessels, have in many
cases kept away from our ports through reluctance of the
owners, or the crews, to take the risks. Where they have come,
losses and delays have been sustained. Italian vessels too
have been coming in ballast to get coal. German strater-^
has made it a main objective to deter neutral shipping, and we
must expect continuing and perhaps increased, difficulty in this
respect. Neutral crews are most unwilling to voj^age to our
-ast Coast ports, though it will be easier to get them to
sail to the Mediterranean. Many neutral governments are
objecting to transfers of flags and objections are also raised
to allowing these nationals to let ships on bare charter
involving displacement of the national crews.
It is uncertain at present how far, if we take the world
shipping situation as a whole, the destruction of ships,
navigational delays, the withdrawal of merchant ships for
combatant service and the immobilisation of German tonnage, will
be offset by the decline of peace commerce and the stoppage of
German imports. Our opportunities of obtaining neutral tonnage
and the price we have to pay will ultimately depend partly upon
this and partly upon the actual war risk of service with us.
In the meantime we have taken the following steps:(
a) The Ministry of Shipping have made satisfactory arrangements
with regard to Norwegian tonnage.
The arrangement, in addition to making available million
tons deadweight of tankers, includes provision for:(
i) not less than 200,000 tons deadweight of tramp tonnage
on a time basis to be delivered in the U.S.A. by
31st March, and in addition tramps suitable for the
near seas trades;
(ii) i i l i - 9 , 0 0 0 gross tons of tramps and liners already in allied
trades to remain in these trades.
- 9 (
Up to date 2 6 tramp vessels have been taken under
(i) above, Ah, for the French and 12 for the British
Government.)
(b) The ministry have also concluded an agreement as to
Swedish tonnage.
This agreement covers:(
i) The carriage in Swedish ships of Swedish exports to
and imports from the United kingdom (and France),
including Swedish ore via Narvik,
(ii) Swedish tramps becoming available in ports overseas
or Mediterranean, Black Sea, Spain or Portugal, to
be offered to the Minis try of Shipping if not
required for cargo for import into Sweden,
(iii) Space on Swedish cargo liners to be made available
for the United Kingdom (or France) if not required
for Swedish imports or cargo for neutral countries in
accordance with 1 9 3 8 carryings.
The estimated amount of space available per annum under
(ii) and (iii) is:300,
0 0 0 deadweight tons from Atlantic coast of
North America (including
1 5 0 , 0 0 0 d.w. in next three
months).
i;.0/50,000 " " from Pacific coast of U.S.A.
3 0 / 6 0 , 0 0 0 " " from Mediterranean
6 0 / 7 0 , 0 0 0 " " from Australia.
(c) Yugoslavia.
The Ministry have concluded an agreement with two firms
of Yugoslav shipowners providing for:(
i) 10 tramp ships on a baro-boat time charter totalling
82,060 tons deadweight-,' 3 of these have already been
delivered and others are for delivery between now
and March;

(ii) 5 of the 10 vessels referred to above to he offered on
completion of current voyages for voyage charter to
the United Kingdom prior to delivery on "bare-troat time
charter.
(d) Greece.
Up to date it has not been possible to arrange an agreement
for the chartering of blocks of Greek vessels. 22 ships of
about 185,000 tons deadweight have been fixed in the market on
a time basis. We are, however, negotiating with the Greeks,
who have about 2 million tons deadweight of tramp ships in all,
and we are trying to use the contemplated Government purchase
of Greek tobacco, etc. as a bargaining factor.
(e) Italy.
Discussions with Italian owners have made progress for
an arrangement for the use of Italian shipping for bringing
cargo from the Mediterranean and from Red Sea Ports. If the
arrangement is concluded, there will be some obligation on our
part to carry some coal to Italy.
(f) Denmark.
We are in negotiation with the Danish Shipowners Association
but apart from continuance of the regular liner calls, the
opportunities for securing Danish tonnage are limited. The
Danish Government is making demands upon their national ships
and the Danish owners complain of contraband delays and the
effect of deviations made in the English Channel and our East
Coast waters.
(g) The Delegation in Spain is trying to get some help from
Spanish shipping.
(h) The possibilities of securing American tonnage by purchase
are being explored.
L-/ We have not yet succeeded in chartering Dutch tonnage,
ut are watching carefully for a favourable opportunity.

General Conclusions.
It must be borne in mira, that:(
a) as military activity develops in France, much bigger
demands (by an increased army) are inevitable.
(b) increases in the possible importing capacity of ships,
to offset these factors, are on a limited and much smaller
scale, and can only be effective gradually.
(c) The main adjustments required are in the sphere of
supply, not shipping.
This is illustrated by the experience of the last war.
Taking the Autumn of 1917 we see that we had less British
tonnage than now. 'Ye. had been supplying the needs of a great
British Army (and to a large extent of the great French army)
v/hich had been long engaged in intensive military operations.
We were shipping 7 million tons of coal a year to Italy.
We had foreign expeditions to suppls^ in Mesopotamia,
Palestine, East Africa and Salonica. We were conveying large
quantities of oats (now replaced by oil in tanker tonnage).
The use of the Mediterranean was restricted and dangerous.
Many ships were sent round by the Cape to reduce the risk.
But no military action was impeded, no vital service went short.
The explanation was not that shipping carried more, but
that the Supply Organisation (British and Allied) had adjusted
itself to a great reduction of imported supplies. We imported
into the United Kingdom (excluding oil) 54 million tons only
as compared with 52 million in 1913, a reduction of one third.
Economies and the use of home substitutes, which every expert
had declared to be impossible, had been made - and without any
disastrous consequence. To take only two examples. Cereal
imports were reduced from 11 million tons to 8-g million tons and
yet stocks were increased in that year. Timber/including
manufactures), was reduced from 11.6 million tons to 3 million
tons - and yet timber was found for the trenches.

necessitates trie use of shipping which was formerly available
to bring in civilian goods. . We are, therefore, asking for
economy, not because of our losses or because there is an
immediate shortage of our supplies, but in order to ensure
ourselves-against the hazards of war and in order to increase
the scale of our war effort,
I may conclude by quoting from a statement of the allied
shipping position which was authorised for publication by the
Transport Council in 1 9 1 6 : "
Every pound of supplies, whether of food or
clothing or other imported articles, which we
can save here means so much more shipping to
take supplies for the armies to France, and
therefore so much more help towards a bigger
force and earljr victory.
It is well that the public should, in considering
the sacrifices they are asked to make, remember
those which Germany has borne for several years.
In Germany the allowance of bread is 2 ^ lbs. a week,
their allowance of bacon and meat together amount s ^ ^ ^
to 9 ounces a week, their allowance of fat between
2 and 2-g- ounces a week.
If everyone in the three European allied countries
saved only 2 ounces a day as compared with last
year's consumption, this saving alone would enable
half a million additional troops to be sent to
France and maintained,"
The figures would now of course be different. But I
suggest that the note struck in this appeal was the right
one. It appeared at the e?ad of a full and frank statement
of the whole allied shipping and supply position, in v/hich
its gravity had been neither exaggerated nor disguised.
