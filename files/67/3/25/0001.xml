WAR CABINET.
RECOGNITION OF THE CZECHO-SLOVAK NATIONAL COMMITTEE.
Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign- Affairs.
TOWARDS the end of September 1939 Dr. Benes informed me of his efforts
to create a Czecho-Slovak National Army to fight in France for the Allied cause.
He claimed to be in touch with the present Protectorate Government at Prague,
a claim which has been confirmed from independent sources, and that Czech and
Slovak emigres had agreed to sink their difficulties and form some central
organisation. Dr. Benes put forward a proposal for the signature of an agreement
between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and himself
providing for the constitution of a Czecho-Siovak military force in the United
Kingdom and indirectly for the recognition by His Majesty's Government of
Dr. Benes's organisation.
2. The question of the constitution of a Czecho-Slovak military forcer
service on the Western front was a matter of more direct.concern tothe^French
Government than to His Majesty's Government, and His Majesty s government
have therefore been in the closest contact with the French Government on the
questions raised by Dr. Benes. The French Government and His Majesty s
Government agreed on the undesirability of entering into any far-reaching commitments
with Dr. Benes, and in particular of recognising any Czecho-Slovak
central organisation until they were satisfied that it was really representative.
3. Negotiations proceeded between the French Government, and M. Osusky
the Czechoslovak Minister in Paris, during October and the first halt ot
November. On the 2nd October an agreement was signed dealing specifically with
the reconstitution of a Czecho-Slovak army in France Personal d ^ n c e 8
between Dr. Benes and M. Osusky delayed the conclusion of a pohtical agreement,
but these were eventually surmounted, and on the 12th and the 13th November
letters were exchanged between M. Osusky and M. Dalacher, of which copies are
attached (Annex A). Apart from M. Benes, M. Osusky and M. Sraniek, the
members of the Czecho-Slovak National Committee are soldiers and technicians.
Czechs and Slovaks are more or less equally represented. In these letters the
French Government were careful not to go beyond recognising the Committee as
qualified to represent the Czecho-Slovak people and in particular to execute the
agreement of the 2nd October for the reconstitution of the Czecho-blovak army.
4. The French Government and Dr. Benes informed me of the agreement
cached in Paris, and Dr. Benes requested His Ma;jesty's Government to take
s"nilar action to that already taken by the French Government. He submitted
to the Foreign Office on the 14th November the draft of the letter he proposed
10749 [20444]
to send to me. This draft went considerably further than the letter sent
M. Daladier by M. Osusky and suggested rather too obviously that the Committee
was only a temporary substitute for a Czecho-Slovak Government. It went into
greater detail than seems to be necessary or desirable regarding the arrangement^
required for the reconstitution of the Czecho-Slovak army.
5. One of our difficulties is the question how we are to refer to the former
Czecho-Slovakia. Any use of the old name " Czechoslovakia " is resented in
Hungary and also by important elements in Slovakia, including the present
Slovak Government, since the use of the word is held to imply that the restoration
of Czecho-Slovakia within its old frontier is one of our war aims. This, in f t a c
is not so, since-we are not at all sure that when-, the time comes Czechs and
Slovaks will necessarily wish to be reunited in a. single State on the former basis
Since, however, Czechs and Slovaks are both represented on the Committee and
since Slovaks will probably form the majority of1 the recruits for the army i
France, it is difficult to avoid referring in our exchange of letters to the
n
Czechoslovak National Committee and to the Czechoslovak army. To avoid
undesirable future commitments, it might, however, be preferable to refer to the
Czechoslovak peoples rather than to the Czechoslovak people, as originally
suggested by Dr. Benes, and as, indeed, is done in the exchange of notes with the
French. The attached drafts (Annex B) have accordingly been prepared in the
Foreign Office for an exchange of letters between Dr. Benes and me, which will
follow as closely as possible the lines of the letters exchanged between M. Osuskv
and the French Government. They have been approved by the War Office, Home
Office, Colonial Office and the Dominions Office; and the Admiralty, Air Ministry
and Cabinet offices have been informed of the position. It is not, however, by any
means certain that they will necessarily be accepted without demur by Dr. Benes
himself in their present form.
6. In the French case, the military agreement preceded the political
agreement. In our own case, it is not contemplated that a Czechoslovak army
should be formed in this country, and it is understood that Czech and Slovak
recruits will, in fact, be directed to France. Dr. Benes will be advised to make
the necessary practical arrangements with representatives of the competent
departments of His Majesty's Government. The arrangements made for the
recruitment of Poles in this country will no doubt serve as a model. In the case
of the Poles, mobilisation orders have been posted at Polish Consulates and
arrangements made for Polish nationals in this country who may apply to British
recruiting offices to be encouraged to offer their services at their own Consulates.
Facilities are being given for the transport of Polish recruits to France, where
the Polish army is being organised. As regards Czecho-Slovak nationals in the
Dominions, it is proposed to inform Dr. Benes that he should approach His
Majesty's Governments in the Dominions direct.
7. It is clearly desirable to encourage the resistance of the Czech and Slovak
peoples to their German oppressors, provided no commitment is made at this stage
regarding the future of the former territories of the Czecho-Slovak Republic.
Such encouragement would be in accordance with the statement made by the Prime
Minister, in a published exchange of letters with Dr. Benes early in September,
that one of our war aims was to free the Czech people from foreign domination.
There are numerous Czechs and Slovaks in France and in the British Empire, and
their military assistance may prove of considerable value to the Allied cause.
As Dr. Benes is in contact with the present Protectorate Government at Prague
there is no reason to fear that recognition of this emigre Committee will, in fact,
indispose the Prague Government towards the Western Powers.
8. It is important that an early decision should be taken on Dr. Benes s
request in order to avoid any criticism that His Majesty's Government are being
less generous than the French Government towards.the Czechoslovak cause.
