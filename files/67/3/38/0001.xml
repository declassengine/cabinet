WAR CABINET.
WAS AIMS.
Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
ON the 8th November I circulated to my colleagues in Cabinet Paper
W.P. (G.) (39) 77 a draft of a reply to the French memorandum on war aims,
which was also reprinted for convenience in the same paper.
This draft reply has been discussed with His Majesty's Governments in the
Dominions and with the Dominion Ministers who have been in London, with the
result that certain minor modifications have been made in paragraphs 6 and 7
of the draft. His Majesty's Governments in the Dominions have expressed their
agreement with the draft as now amended, which, with the concurrence of the
Secretary of State for the Dominions, I circulate to my colleagues herewith. They
have agreed that it should be communicated in this form to the French Government,
and I propose, if my colleagues agree, to hand it to the French Ambassador
at an early date.
The only changes in the original draft, as circulated on the 8th November,
are as follows : (
a) Paragraph 6, line 2. The words " will not of itself " have been substituted
for the words " m a y not."
(b) Paragraph 6, line 7. The words " whatever arguments might be adduced
on one side or the other in any discussion of these matters " have been
inserted immediately after the word " u n i t y ."
(c) Paragraph 7, line 3. The words " to menace the peace of European
nations and of the world ' ' have been substituted for the words ' ' in
relation to the United Kingdom and France."

Draft Reply to the French Government.
BEFORE receiving the memorandum of the French Government, His
Majesty's Government had already given some preliminary consideration to the
question of war aims. They had been prompted to consider thrs matter not only
in order that some guidance might be given at a suitable opportunity to certain
sections of British public opinion, but in order that the cause, in whose defence
His Majesty's Government stood united with the French Government, might gain
a wider and more intelligent support,
10768 [20486]
2. The cause for which the Allied Governments of France and Great
Britain have taken up arms is to stop acts of aggression on the part of the German
Government in the present and to-ensure against their repetition in the future
Two wars imposed on Britain and France in a single generation by the action of
German Governments, differing in outward complexion but inspired by the same
aggressive and dominating spirit, are a solemn warning that this spirit, if it be
not extinguished and laid to rest by the Germans themselves, must be rendered
harmless by those whom i t threatens.
3. His Majesty's Government are therefore in agreement with the French
Government in desiring tofind the surest and most enduring guarantees against
any further repetition of German aggression. They are convinced that such
guarantees can only be based on close and continued co-operation between the
French Government and His Majesty's Government during the period which will
follow after the defeat of Germany. That co-operation, which during the war
will have covered economic as well as military and political problems, should be
extended after the war has ended, and should, as His Majesty's Government
would hope, be inspired by a common purpose and outlook on the machinery
required to enable the nations of Europe to regain or maintain their liberties, and
to strengthen their political, social, and economic structures.
4. To achieve this common purpose His Majesty's Government and the
French Government must, unless a German Government can be found which is
willing and able voluntarily to accept their terms, secure the defeat of Germany,
and this, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, constitutes the primary
war aim of the two Governments. It is only in the light of the circumstances
prevailing at the time when their object is achieved that the lines of any
territorial settlement can be profitably considered. It would therefore be
premature to enter into detailed discussion of territorial questions. For this
reason His Majesty's Government have been careful not to define in precise
terms what they imply by the restoration of independence to Poland and Czecho-
Slovakia, and to limit themselves to referring in general terms to the recovery
by the Polish, Czech and Slovak peoples of their liberties. Flis Majesty's Government
trust that the French Government will adopt a similar attitude. It should,
however, be pointed out that while it is hoped to secure independence for all
European peoples, one of the weaknesses of the post-war settlement was the
establishment of a number of small national States which were " viable " neither
in the military nor economic sense. The settlement was therefore highly unstable,
and proved an ineffective barrier to the expansionist ambitions of Great Powers
either in the West or in the East. Accordingly, it may be necessary to contemplate
some form of closer association, at the least a system offinancial and
economic co-operation in Central and South-Eastern Europe.
5. For this purpose His Majesty's Government suggest that it would be
wise to encourage at once closer co-operation between the Balkan States and
closer co-operation between the various refugee groups of Poles, Czechs, Slovaks
and Austrians.
8. As regards the future of the German Reich, His Majesty's Government
agree that the removal of Herr Hitler and his entourage will not of itself be a
sufficient remedy against the re-emergence of German militarist and expansionist
ideas, but it is not at present possible to tell in what conditions the defeat or
surrender of Germany will take place, and any suggestion that it was the intention
of His Majesty's Government and the French Government to seek the political
dismemberment of Germany or to disrupt German unity, Avhatever arguments
might be adduced on one side or the other in any discussion on these matters,
would have the immediate effect of rallying the German people behind their
present leaders. Flis Majesty's Government therefore consider it wiser to watch
the course of events and to arrange for further consultation as soon as it is
possible more closely to forecast the course of internal political developments in
Germany.
7. As regards material guarantees, thefirst must evidently be that Germany
shall never again be allowed to build up a preponderance of armed force to menace
the peace of European nations and of the world. The methods of establishing this
guarantee may perhaps be left for further consideration and in view of what
s
has been said above i t would seem premature to make any public statement of war
aims m precise terms. His Majesty's Government would prefer that the two
Governments in agreement should limit their public declarations to the general
principles on which their common policy is, and will continue to be, based and
that, while protecting the world, so far as is humanly possible, from a recurrence
of war, they should emphasise their common desire to secure a post-war settlement
which would be satisfactory not only to themselves but to all other peoples whose
collaboration will be essential in the work of reconstruction.
8. These are the preliminary comments of His Majesty's Government on
the approach made by the French Government. His Majesty's Government will
welcome a further exchange of views with the French Government, and will be
glad to consider any proposals which the French Government have to make both
in regard to the terms on which peace should be concluded with Germany, and the
wider European settlement which might follow the termination of hostilities.
