ENCLOSURE I.
(Confidential.)
Sir, December 1939.
I AM commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to forward
herewith for your very confidential information the enclosed copy of a letter,
with its enclosure, addressed to the Eirst Sea Lord by the Commander-in-Chief,
Western Approaches, Admiral Sir Martin Dunbar-Nasmith.
The question raised is by no means free from difficulty, but Their Lordships
feel that there is great force in the suggestion that the reception by those at
sea of a constant flow of reports of sinkings of merchant ships may well produce
an effect which i t is of great importance to avoid if it be practicable.
My Lords appreciate the difficulty that, owing to the small amount of news
which can be broadcast as compared with that carried by a newspaper, anything
broadcast, particularly with reference to the war, is likely to be regarded as
of first-class significance. It is, however, to be expected that, as a normal feature
of the war, ships will continue to be lost; just as new ships will continue to be
acquired, by new construction, capture, or otherwise to take their places.
Accordingly, they desire that announcements of sinkings over the wireless
should be confined to those cases where there is some special news interest. Thus,
the sinking of the Terukuni Maru might have been broadcast because she was
a Japanese ship; but there is no reason why, at the present stage of the war,
reference should be made to the mining of such ships as the A theltemplar or the
Inverlaine (see 9 P.M. Broadcast, the 16th December last).
I n making this request their Lordships realise that they are asking the
B.B.C. to refrain from broadcasting news which will be available to the public
through the press. The news in question is, however, of the kind which would
receive in the newspapers no particular emphasis, such as is the inevitable result
of selecting it for broadcasting. They are confident that the Corporation will
readily appreciate that, whereas the press print these losses without much
prominence amid a mass of other encouraging material, the reiteration of losses
on the Broadcast, often apart from any other matters, is calculated to spread
undue despondency. Moreover, the newspapers usually only reach the Fleet at
intervals, while the broadcasts are listened to every evening, as they are given
out, by all ships' companies. The attached transcript* of the B.B.C. announcement
of 9 o'clock on the 16th will show the character of bulletin which is
needlessly depressing.
I am, &amp;c.
The Director-General,
British Broadcasting Corporation,
Portland Place, W . 1.
ENCLOSURE II.
AN announcement by the Admiralty to-day gives the names of six officers and
123 ratings missing and believed to have been droAvned when the destroyer
Duchess sank after the collision announced two days ago. Their relatives have
been informed.
The list is believed to be complete.
The only survivors Avere one officer and 22 ratings.
The Admiralty announced this evening that an area off the mouths of the
Rivers Tyne and Tees has been made dangerous to navigation by German mines.
The exact positions defining this area were broadcast at 6 o'clock, and will be read
again at midnight.

The- 5,000 ton Greek steamer Germaine was sunk in the Atlantic yesterday
while on her way to Eire with a cargo of maize. Her crew was picked up by two
Dutch ships. Three other neutral losses yesterday were the Norwegian steamers
Ragni and H. C. Flood, and the small Swedish ship Ursus.
The Liverpool tanker Atheltemplar, mined in the North Sea yesterday, has
now been salved and brought into port by tugs; while the mined Dublin tanker
Inverlaine has drifted on to a beach on the north-east coast. Five men are missihofrom
the two ships.
ENCLOSURE I I I.
A dmiralty House,
Dear C. N. S. Devonport, December 14, 1939.
CURTEIS (Commodore, R.N. Barracks), brought to my notice a matter which
is of some importance, and as it has a bearing on your letter of the 5th December
I asked him to put it on paper, and feel that it is a point which could well be
borne in mind by the Publicity Censor without in any way affecting the purpose
aimed at in your letter.
The morale of the men is very good they are fine fellows and keen; it is.
however, important that we should not place an unnecessary strain on it. I have
had personal confirmation from the captain of an armed merchant cruiser of the
bad effect which the broadcast of the Rawalpindi affair had on the personnel of his
ship. It must be evident to these men that their ships have little chance in an
encounter with an enemy warship, but the account broadcast on this occasion was
not helpful to morale. Some of the broadcasts we have heard in past could have
been framed more happily from this point of view.
I entirely agree with the proposals in paragraph 9 of Curteis's letter. In the
case of the air we very seldom hear of our own machines being shot down, but one
does see long lists of air casualties in the papers.
Yours sincerely,
D. A. DUNBAR-NASMITH.

BROADCASTING OF NAVAL WAR NEWS.
FOR some time I have felt strongly that the Wireless News, as far as war
a t sea is concerned, is given out in such a manner as to tend to lower the morale
of those serving at sea and to be usually quite gratifying to the enemy.
2ih - \ d o n o t k n o w w h o I m s t n e final say as r ega rds the form in which News
is published, but before doing so he should be able to realise the possible effect
oi broadcasting on the personnel concerned at sea and their relations at home.
3. As the years have advanced, war has become more nerve-racking, but the
personnel who have to serve have become more refined. Gone are the days wheii
peace-time t r a i n i n g in some measure fitted the men mentally and physically for
the strain of war. For one instance, compare t h e modern stoker with his opposite
number in 1914. The latter trained mostly in coal; real hard work, needing guts,
especially in rough weather. To-day the rapid increase of the Navy has meant
large numbers of very inexperienced personnel being at sea at the outbreak of war.
I t may be of interest to note here that, in the coming year, roughly 50,000
youngsters will be entered for hostilities only and, with the shortest possible
amount of training on shore, will be sent to sea under war conditions.
4. The Pensioner of to-day is also on the average a different person from
his opposite number in the late war. Having been through the last war they
did not as a body wish to be called up for another, and there is no doubt that a
large number do not want to be at sea.
5. Much as I dislike having to say so the personnel are neither as tough
physically or mentally as the large majority of those who served in the late war.
6. After H.M.S. Courageous was sunk one Commanding Officer in
conversation stated that the effect on the habits of a number of his ship's company
was marked. Instead of their spare hours being spent resting, a number of men
seldom went below. I cannot believe that this is only an isolated case, and it is
probably correct to say that it is fairly general in both the Navy and Merchant
Navy.
7. Most ships at sea take in the Wireless News and men ashore listen, and
I am certain that it cannot do their morale any good to hear day after day
news of ships sunk with lurid details. Two very recent announcements are fresh
in my memory and it is easy to imagine the effect on any men at sea who do not
possess strong nerves
(i) The Blanche sunk some weeks ago. for some reason came into the
limelight the other clay, casualties were reiterated and the announccment
ended by stating " The rating on watch on the depth charges
was killed instantly, another man close to him was blown overboard."
(ii) A Norwegian steamer was sunk yesterday in the North Sea either by
mine or submarine all perished.
8. The loss of the Rawalpindi was given out by the B.B.C. with much detail.
I cannot imagine that an Army Commander wishing to raise the morale of his
men for an attack would broadcast to his sector : " Last evening in a certain
sector 3 5 0 men made an attack. 314 were killed, 26 are missing, believed prisoners,
and 1 0 returned after spending all night nearly frozen in No Man's Land."
9. I suggest that to keep the Public informed it is only necessary for the
B.B.C. to give out in the news, when desired, that such and such a man-of-war
has been lost or damaged, with no further details. The name to be published in
the press with the addition of a casualty list. Any victory or level action between
similar ships to be given full publicity. The broadcast of a massacre like the
Rawalpindi is food which only the tigers in other armed merchant cruisers can
digest without ill effect. As regards Allied Merchantmen and Neutrals, I would
suggest that it is only necessary for the B.B.C. to give out the weekly loss of
tonnage and no other details. Any case of a ship which avoided sinking or
capture under circumstances needing courage should be fully reported.
10. There were many cases in the late war of neurasthenia from pure war
strain. I suggest that with the assistance of the B.B.C. there may be a marked
increase in the present war, as far as the sea-faring population is concerned,
unless steps are taken to publish the Wireless News in some such form as I have
suggested.
