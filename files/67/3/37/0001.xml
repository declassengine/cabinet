CO-OPERATION OF THE UNION OP SOUTH AFRICA..
Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.
I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues
the attached copy of a telegram from General Smuts to the
Union High Commissioner in London, in which he suggests
that reports from Nairobi make it appear advisable that one
Union Brigade and several Union Air Squadrons should be
moved to Kenya as a precautionary measure. This telegram,
which was communicated to me by Mr. Waterson, has been
discussed with representatives of the Foreign Office,
War Office, Air Ministry and Colonial Office, and the
following paragraphs represent the views taken in this
inter-departmental discussion.
2. It is not known what was the nature of the reportsfrom
East Africa referred to by General Smuts, and there
is no information to suggest that there is any threat
which would make the immediate reinforcement of East
Africa necessary.
3. It will be recalled that the Union Government are
committed to an undertaking not to send Union troops outside
Africa, and General bmuts has recently interpreted this
undertaking as a positive obligation to defend all African
Territories from Kenya to the south. While therefore
General

General Smuts is not in a position to consider the despatch
of Union troops beyond Kenya at the present stage, it is
conceivable that he may have in mind the possibility at a
later stage of a move further north, e.g., to Egypt,
should the political situation in the Union become
easiero
4, As regards the proposed move of the Brigade to
Kenya, unless there were a radical change in the situation,
it is not expected that such a move would in fact prove
necessary, but it would be useful if detailed plans
could be worked, out forthwith to enable the move to
take place without delay if and when the necessity should
arise.
On the other hand the Air btaff would welcome the
despatch of air squadrons from the Union to Kenya.
Our air strength in the Middle East area is very inadequate,
and a move to Kenya might well prove a stepping stone
for a further move by Union air forces to Egypt or elsewhere
in the Middle East. In any event it v/ould make it
possible to move the Southern Khodesian squadron from
Kenya to Egypt.
5. It is necessary to bear in mind possible Italian
reactions to the move of larger reinforcements to Kenya.
As regards the Brigade, it is not proposed to suggest
to General Smuts that this move should take place unless
there were in fact a danger of hostile action by Italy.
If it is decided to move the squadrons it should be
possible to explain the move to the Italian Government,
on the grounds that the situation in the Middle East area,
and

and particularly the possibility of Soviet hostility,
makes it desirable to build up our air forces in that
general area.
60 It is also necessary to bear in mind that the
Southern Rhodesia Government are suspicious of any attempt
by the union Government to establish in time of war a
footing in Central and East Africa, which might be maintained
in time of peace, It will, therefore,, be necessary to
explain the proposed moves of the Union Forces to the
Southern Rhodesia Government, but it is folt to be unlikely
that they would, object to the present proposals., particularly
as they appear to arise from a meeting between the Prime
Minister of the union and the prime Minister of southern
Rhodesia,
7. From the Colonial Office point of view, the
stationing in Kenya of a body cf Union troops, who would not
be sympathetic with Colonial native policy, would net be
favoured? unless, of course, their presence in the Colony
were considered necessary for military purposes. In that
case, all political objections would of course be of
secondary importance.
6. The Union Government have recently enquired, how
-far it would be possible for certain large demands for
equipment for the Union forces to be met in the United
Kingdom, It was explained to Colonel Reitz during his
visit to this country that these demands must take a very low
order of priority/" so long as there was no possibility of the
Union Forces taking an active part in Europe, So far as the
moves to East Africa are concerned, there seems to be no
justi fication

justification for modifying the supply arrangements
which are now being made with the Union authorities, and
it will be desirable to make this clear to the Union
Government.
9. In these circumstances, it is proposed that a
reply should be sent to General Smuts on the lines of the
attached draft aide memoire, suggesting!(
a) that plans should be worked out for the move of
the Union Brigade t,o Kenya in ease at any time it should
be needed there; and
(b) that detailed preparations should be made for
the Union Squadrons to move to Kenya when accommodation
is available.

T E L S G R A M.
December 7th
For High Commissioner from Minister of Defence.
Most Secret. At Conference at Pretoria on 5th December between
Prime Ministers of Union and Southern Rhodesia defence
position in the North was reviewed. Full Intelligence
reports from Nairobi were available. Besides what is being
done locally in Kenya it appeared advisable that one Union
Brigade and several Air Squadrons should be moved to Kenya
as precautionary measure. It appears important that Mombasa
especially should be secured against air and sea attack as a
necessary port for any future operations. If this programme
is to be carried out next spring road transport arrangements
have to be studied petrol dumps for mechanical and air
transport prepared and. position at Mombasa more carefully
gone into. Consultations with Northern territories will
also have to take place. Please consult with British
Governments and War Authorities and ascertain whether
in view of general international and war situations above
action is approved. I shall also be glad to get their views
and advice on general questions of defence measures in the
North especially in view of war situation as a whole, ends.

A I D E MEMOIREA
1* His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom
much appreciate the offer of His Majesty's Government in
the Union of South Africa to move one Union Brigade
and several Air Scpuadrons to Kenya, as a precautionary measure.
It is observed that General Smuts' telegram refers to
Intelligence reports from Nairobi as indicating the
advisability of these moves. It is not clear what was
the exact nature of these reports, but it may be observed
that the information in the possession of the United
Kingdom Government is not such as to suggest that there
is any threat which would make it necessary to reinforce
East Africa with land forces, and it is not expected
that the move of the Union brigade to Kenya would be
recpuired unless there were evidence of hostile intentions
from Italy. It will be appreciated that so long as
relations with Italy continue as at present it would be
undesirable to take any action which would provoke Italian
resentment.
2. Should any threat from Italy materialise it
would be most helpful to us if the union brigade were
moved to Kenya, and it seems to us that it would be
highly desirable that cletailed plans should be worked
out forthwith between the Union defence authorities and
the General Officer Commanding, East Africa, who is being
notified, to enable this move to take place without
delay if the necessity should arise.
3. Ive think that the Union Government will like to
know

know that consideration is at present being given to the
possibility of putting into effect a plan devised before the
war for the concentration in East Africa of troops from the
East and west African Colonies into an African Division. such a
force would form a strategic reserve for employment primarily
in Africa, or, should the need arise, in the Middle East.
4 . While therefore we do not consider it necessary
S
for the Union to move land forces to Kenya in the near future,
we should however welcome the despatch of Union air forces.
Our air strength in the Middle East and North Africa is
by no means adequate; and the arrival of Union squadrons would
enable other forces now in Kenya to be relieved. Moreover
the arrival of a few air squadrons seems unlikely to be
regarded as provocative ty Italy. In order that examination
may be made of the accommodation and other facilities required in
East Africa and the date by which they could, be made ready
we should, be grateful for particulars of the units, including
aircraft and. personnel strength,- which the Union Government
would be willing to send.
5. As regards equipment for both the land and air
forces, the extent to which it would be possible for the
requirements of the Union to be met from United Kingdom
sources has been explained to Colonel Reitz while he was in
this country and we regret that it would not be possible,
on account of the projected move to East Africa, to anticipate
the supply programme which has been communicated to
Colonel Reitz,
6 o It will be appreciated that it would, not be
possible for the administration of Union land forces in East
Africa

Africa to be carried out from this country. It is assumed,
therefore, that plans will be worked out on the basis that
the Union Government would he responsible for the
administration of the Union brigade, if and when sent to
East Africa. In addition, it is assumed that the Union
authorities will provide the necessary depot and maintenance
facilities for any air forces they may send to Kenya; these
might he supplemented to some extent hy the limited
facilities now in Kenya.
7. In conclusion we should like to express again
our gratitutde for the Union Governments generous offer
of assistance.
