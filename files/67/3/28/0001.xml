WAR CABINET,
CZECHO-SLOV^JCIA (FINANCIAL CLAIMS AND REFUGEES) BILL.
Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
When the Germans invaded Czecho-Slovakia on March
15th9 1939? legislation was passed to prevent banks holding
accounts or assets for persons in Czecho-Slovakia from parting
with such assets without Treasury permission. Before the
outbreak of the war I had informed the House of Commons that
a scheme would be submitted for the approval of the House for
applying these assets.
The assets consisted of s (
1) balances in the name of the National Bank of Czecho-
Slovakia at the Bank of England representing the unexpended
amount of our free gift of &#163;4 millions to Czecho-Slovakia for
assisting refugees who emigrate %
(2) the unexpended balance of our advance to the Czecho
Slovak Government for assisting refugees remaining in
Czecho-Slovakia and for economic reconstruction!
(3) gold forming part of the monetary reserves of the
Czecho-Slovak National Bank and balances;
(4) gold and securities belonging to private persons in
Czecho-Slovak! a.
The total was made up as follows;
&#163; millions
Unexpended balance of free gift
Unexpended balance of advance
Czech National Bank gold 6*
Net amount of private assets 1
Total approxo &#163;14,500,000
The increase in the value of gold in terms of sterling brings
the total up to about &#163;15-g- millions.
The Treasury invited persons with financial claims
against Czecho-Slovalcia to register them at the Bank of England,
The claims received have not so far been critically examined
and are no doubt exaggerated. A stated amount can he

given for (
a) Bank "balances and other cash claims &#163;4 millions
(h) Nominal value of Bonds &#163;2% millions
hut amount properly represented by further claims in
respoct of (
c) Industrial and other shares, and
(d) Miscellaneous, including Real Estate, Rents,
Pensions, etc cannot be estimated with any approach to
accuracy0 The intention before the outbreak of war
was to prepare a scheme for distributing the assets
among the claimants as a whole on some equitable basis.
With the outbreak of war the whole situation has
changed, since our war aims include the restoration of
an independent Czecho-Slovakia and it would not be
desirable at this stage to take over the gold belonging
to the Czech National Bank or assets belonging to Czech
individuals.. Accordingly it is now proposed only to
take over and distribute the unexpended balance of the
free gift and the unexpended balance of the advance.
The unexpended balance of the free gift would be used for
the -purpose originally intended, namely to assist Czech
refugees who have emigratedo The Treasury have advanced
&#163;500,000 to the Czech Refugees Trust Fund and the
unexpended balance of the free gift would be used to
repay the Treasury for this advance and for the rest to
provide the Trust Fund with the money required to carry
out the terms of its trusto Under our original
financial agreement the Czech refugees who emigrated were
to be provided with amounts ranging from &#163;200 to &#163;400 to
assist them to start life overseas in their country of
final settlement, and the object of the Trust is bothto
carry out this undertaking and to provide maintenance
for Czech refugees during their temporary stay in this
country. It is difficult to say whether the whole of
the amount to be paid to the Trust will be required for these

-pwirp-^^ja-^e^ore the end of the \Vc.r hut we
y
cannot properly apply the money for other
purposes end if a balance is left at the
end of the war the question of how it is to
be used will have to be settled then,.
It is proposed that the unexpended
balance of the advance should be used (l)
to provide for the current service of loans
issued or guaranteed by the Czecho-Slovak
Government- and other external loans, and (2)
to settle cash claims including those in respect
of bank balances, The scheme will be administered
by a special branch of the Treasury
which will in fact be the staff supplied by
the Council of Foreign Bondholders under the
direction of Sir Stanley Wyatt, who has been
good enough to offer his services for this
purpose.
There will no doubt be many complaints
that we are not making any payments at this
stage in respect of industrial shares and
other claims, but it is quite impossible to
investigate such claims properly during the
continuance of the war and the only claims
which can be dealt with now are those of a
simple and definite character in respect of
which the holders can produce coupons on bonds
or the concrete evidence as to the existence
of bank accounts owned by them in Czecho4-
Slovakia. The attached scheme has been
drafted to carry out these proposals and the
attached Bill has been drafted to obtain the
4- Appendix I 0
6 Appendix I'Jk

necessary powers. The Bill makes it quite
clear tiitit we a, o only taking over the unexpended
balance of the free gift and of the advance, As
regards distribution, the Bill is in general terras and
there will be a Treasury Order (and if necessary
Amending Orders later) to carry out in detail the
proposed scheme. The Bill is not yet in its final
form and will need to be modified as regards certain
technical points,
There is considerable pressure from the House
of Commons that a decision on the matter should be
announced before the Koo.se adjourns^ There is a
question down fczo Tuesday next 13th December.
The Treasury have informally communicated the
proposals to the Czecho-Slovak Legation in London.
Their immediate reaction was wholly favourable and
they have promised to give a considered view in a
few days.
Subject to no objection being raised by the
Czech Legation;. I propose to reply to the Question
on Tuesday that legislation will be Introduced
as soon as may be after the House reassembles, and
to arrange for the Bill to be submitted to the
Home Policy Committee during the Recessc

1. The Treasury will authorise payment in respect of
the following claims on Czecho-Slovakia, namely (
a) Coupons of bonds" issued "by the Government
of the Czechoslovak Republic and
coupons expressed in a currency other than

provided that no claimant shall receive a greater sum in
respect of any one claim than &#163; 5 0 , 0 0 0 ,
Claims can only be accepted if payable on demand
or at call or, if payable at the expiration of a fixed
period, when such period has expired.
It is for consideration what to do^about
the Czechs guarantee of the Austrian
guaranteed conversion loan,

The holder of an accepted claim must assign to
the Treasury or their nominee the whole of such claim
and surrender such evidence of title as is in his
possession, provided that such assignment in respect
of a claim not paid in full shall he without prejudice
to the rights of the claimant to receive any further
payments made thereafter in respect of that claim.

Reichsmarks or Austrian Schillings will he respectively
converted at Kr. 140 to the &#163;, 3M to the &#163; and Sch.
to the &#163;, and other- currencies will he converted at the
middle rate of the day preceding the date of payment of
the claim.
5. Before payment will he made, it must he proved to
the satisfaction ol: the Treasury that (
a) in the case of Bonds, the bond was beneficially
owned on the 8th May, 1939 by an individual
ordinarily residents or a corporation ordinarily
carrying on business, in the United Kingdom on
that date; provided that where compliance with
this condition is -impossible owing to the
beneficial ownership of the capital and income of
any bond having been vested on the said date in
(several persons one or more of whom is not a
British holder), the Treasury may allow such
payment to be made in respect of the bond as they
consider equitable having regard to the
circumstances of the ease)
(b) in the case of Bank balances, etc.
(i) the claim falls within the Scheme and has been,
registered with the Bank of England under its
Notice of the 3rd April 1939 prior to the
(date of the Act); and that sufficient
evidence of validity has been produced;
(ii) the claimant is a British holder as defined
in the next Article and that at no time since
the 14th March 1939 has the claim been
beneficially owned by any person other than
the claimant or a person from whom the
claimant has since inherited,.

6. For the purposes of Article 5 (b) (ii) a British
holder means (
a) any individual who was ordinarily resident^ in.
the United Kingdom on the 14th March 1939
and is still so resident at the date of
claiming;
(b) any corporation ordinarily carrying on
business in the United Kingdom on the
same dates.
7. Any claim under this Scheme (other than claims in
respect of coupons which should be made through the
appointed paying Agent) must be made, in writing,
and supported by evidence of validity to the
Treasury (Czecho-Slovak Claims Office), Sorsgate,
Cuckfield, Sussex..
8. The Treasury will retain full power to decide all
questions arising in regard to the Scheme and any
decisions given by or on behalf of the Treasury shall
be final. The Treasury may also, so far as the total
fund available may permit, provide for further
payments on account of claims only partially paid.
9. Any costs of administration will be chargeable to
the fund.
* Note. It is for consideration whether to extend
this to include refugees who became
resident after 14th March and prior to
3rd September 1939.
