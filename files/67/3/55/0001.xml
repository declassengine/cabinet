WAR CABINET.
LEAKAGE OF INFORM iTION.
Second Interim Re-port of the Eeakage^f Information Committee..
1, On the 31st October the Minister without Portfolio and
the Secretary of State for War, in consultation with the Secretary
of State for the Home Department "ana the Secretary of State for
Dominion Iffairs, were invited by the War Cabinet to examine the
question of the control of communi cat ions between this country,. Eire
and Northern Ireland, including the control of passenger traffic,
-and to report to the War Cabinet. (Cabinet 66(59) Minute 6).
2. On the 2nd November the Minister without Portofolio made a
verbal report to the War Cabinet^and a number of decisions were
taken for dealing with the leakage of information from this coxmtry
to Germany. These included
arrangements for listening in to all telephone conver'
sations between Great Britain and Eire and between Great
Britain and Northern Ireland;
the routing of all cable traffic ex-Eire through
London, where it would be scrutinised by the British
Censorship authorities;
supply by the Illicit Wireless Interception Organisation
of apparatus and personnel to Eire for the detection of
possible short wave transmitters in that country;
consideration to be given to the use of wireless from
neutral ships on leaving ports in this country;
scrutiny of German broadcasts, and all statements therein.
which had any bearing on enemy espionage activities in this
country to be transcribed and analysed.
In addition, the Secretary of State for War was asked, to report
Qn a suggestion that extensive protected areas - should
De created in localities, where special importance
w&amp;s attached to keeping secret the presence or movement of Naval
Qr Air Services.

3. The above Ministers met once more on Friday
23nd December, to review the position in the light of
a comprehensive report by the Secretary of State for
War on all the above activities.
4. The information before the Committee revealed that
neither telephones, nor examination of cables, nor the
interception of wireless in this country or in Eire or of
messages from neutral ships, have as yet disclosed any leakage
from this country through Eire. The vast majority
of the allegations as to leakage "being revealed by the
German broadcasts have proved to be without foundation, a
but two or three doubtful cases were still under
examination when the Committee met.
5. We now come to the question of "protected areas".
In a protected area under the Defence Regulations, every
inhabitant, irrespective of nationality, is subject to a
measure of surveillance, and persons coming in and out
have to Lave passes. An area staff with controlled posts
and a controlling office has to be set up. Such a
system cannot be applied to main centres of population,
such as the Clyde. The interference to industry would
be very considerable and the requirements in troops
prohibitive.
7. A protected area under the Defence Regulations covering
the Orkneys and the Shetlands came into operation on the
1st December, and it is hoped to become fully effective in
a short time in preserving the secrecy of the presence and
movements of war ships and air forces in that region.

It is now proposed to declare the whole region of
the North of Scotland; north of the Caledonian Canal and
including the Islands of Mull and Skye as another
protected area under the Defence Regulations, and
reconnaisances are taking place to control this area with
controlled posts and patrols.
9s The Committee agreed that to apply the same
measure to seme fifte a: ports which the Admiralty
proposed should he declare! as protected areas under the
Defence Regulations was noc feasible, but as an
alternative, it was agreed that certain areas might be
declared under- the Aliens Order and preliminary
discus si oat: have already taken- place-between the Admiralty,
tbe-Har. .0f f ice^ 11,1. G and the Home "Office on this matter.
Under' this scheme., all aliens will be subjected to
strict surveillance, certain types evacuated and no new
ones allowed to enter without special permission.
10. The Home Secretary, although perfectly willing to
carry out this proposal if it is deemed necessary, has
thought it only right to warn the Committee that the
proposal will inflict a good deal of hardship on aliens,
including some who have resided in the ports in question
for a long time. This measure will be subjected to
considerable local criticisms, and will in all
probability be challenged in Parliament.
1 1 . In spite of these objections the Committee
consider that in the interests of naval security, the
proposals should be adopted and that the followingports
should as a first step be declared protected
areas under the Aliens Order;Firth
of Forth.
Harwich.
Chatham.
Portsmouth.
Plymouth.
The Home Secretary is taking steps to give effect to
this proposal which falls within his existing powers.
12. The Committee confirmed their previous
recommendation of the 2nd November - that it is
undesirable at the present time to go to the length of
imposing telephone and telegraph censorship on all
traffic from Great Britain to the whole of Ireland, or
the application of a rigorous control of passenger
traffic, which would risk losing the present useful
co-operation with Eire in censorship. They note,
however, that the recent decision of the Cabinet
approving the issue of a world-wide postal censorship
warrant (war Cabinet 121(39) Conclusion 4(c)) would,
subject to the concurrence of the Secretary "of State for
Dominion Affairs, enable a measure of censorship to be
imposed on mails to. and from Eire to such greater or
less extent as might be thought desirable in any given
