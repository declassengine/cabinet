PURCHASES OF AMERICAN SHIPS.
Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping.
1. The Ministry of Shipping have explored through
Sir Ashley Sparks, i4s- representative in the United States, .
the possibilities of purchasing United States vessels.
2 . The vessels which have been under consideration are (
a) Vessels completed ahout 20 years ago as part of
of the war effort of the United States Government *
These are now in the hards of the United States
Maritime Commission; the majority of them are laid up
and some are under charter to private Steamship Lines.
After much delay, the United States Government have now
decided not to sell at present any ships owned by the
United States Maritime Commission, and in any case not to
do so until all privately-owned ships which may be offered
for sale are disposed, of.
Our Embassy has been instructed to ask the
United States Government whether it is possible to give
British purchasers the first option on any of the vessels
owned by the Maritime Commission, should it be decided
later to permit any of them to be disposed of to purchasers
outside the United States.
(b) Privately-owned vessels.
Some of the American Shipping Companies, in view of
the American Neutrality Legislation, may be willing to

get rid of a good deal of their tonnage, which is mainly
obsolete or approaching obsolescence, at high prices, and
the American Government has now indicated that objection will
not be raised to the disposal of privately-owned vessels to
British interests, but the question of transfer is so much J
governed by political considerations that we cannot be
certain that any transfer will be approved.
3. The vessels in which we are most interested are cargo
vessels of from 7/9,000 tons deadweight, suitable for the carriage
of bulk cargoes and with speeds of from 9-g- to 11 knots. The
Treasury have agreed to the purchase of up to 50 suitable vessels
at a cost not exceeding 300,000 dollars each, ready for sea.
4. Sir Ashley Sparks has been instructed to purchase ships on
this basis, and is negotiating accordingly. His opinion is that
more will have to be paid and that we shall not be able to buy
at less than 45 dollars per ton deadweight. On this the Treasury
have agreed that we may go to this figure if necessary, for not
more than four vessels, at present.
5 . Arrangements have been made for the co-ordination of our
action with that of the French, who will no doubt desire some
share in any American vessels which are purchased.
