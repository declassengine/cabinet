REPORT ON B . B . C . POLICY IN ANNOUNCING NAMES OP SURVIVORS
 - - -- OfnD^ASfMSo
The Cent roller of Programmes, Mra ool Is .r
states that it is the BoB.C's fixed policy, based on its
experience, not to broadcast lists of survivors of any
disaster; lists are in most cases incomplete, the names
are often wrongly given in the first reports, listeners
mistake the names they hear (in this connection the most
common telephone enquiry is for a single name misheard
in an S , O o S . message)0 The BoBoCo hold that with a
long list of names., say for a mining disaster, the dangers
of mishearing through excitement are much increased, and
lead in the long run only to uncertainty and increased
misery0 So far as naval disasters are concerned they
point out that the number o f similar names in the R 0 N . V . R.
especially is legion,. So n s i n c y of the recruits come from
the Western Highlands and Islands, where not only are the
names similar - Maclean, MacLeod - but that in many
Highland families there are standard Christian names like
James and John, Duncan and Norman, which increase the
confusion0 Therefore in the public interest they maintain
that these lists should be made available in print through
the presso A further, though possibly minor, consideration
was touched on by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he
suggested difficulties in any case where the names of known
survivor;:; ran into hundreds a- With the "Courageous" for
example, the hundreds of names would have taken longer to
read than a whole News Bulletin,
In the case of the "Athenia", successive lists were
issued over two days, and the reading of these lists would
have become collect!vely most misleadingo In this present
instance Admiral Hallett telephoned the Home News Editor,

who t o l d him of t h e C o r p o r a t i o n ' s g e n e r a l p o l i c y.
Admiral H a l l e t t was t o i d that i f he R e q u i r e d the C o r p o r a t i on
t o make an announcement1 i t c o u l d of course he dorie
a f t e r c o n s u l t a t i o n w i t h h i g h e r B . B . C . a u t h o r i t y : for the
B . B . C . cannot r e f u s e any such r e q u e s t s from any
Government Department. Admiral H a l l e t t p r e s s e d his
r e q u e s t , hut would not s a y t h a t an announcement was
