The King's Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.
NOVEMBER 23, 1939.
MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS :
THE shadow of war has once more fallen over Europe.
Despite the efforts of My Government to preserve peace, Germany, in
violation of her solemn undertakings, wantonly invaded Poland. This new
instance of German aggression and bad faith was a challenge which we could not
have declined without dishonour to ourselves and without peril to the cause of
freedom and the progress of mankind.
We seek no material gain. Liberty and free institutions are our birthright
which we, like our forefathers, are resolved to preserve.
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS :
I thank you for your ready acceptance of the heavy financial burdens
rendered necessary as a contribution towards meeting the severe expense of war.
So prompt and ungrudging a response has deeply impressed the world and
demonstrates the unflinching determination of My people to make every sacrifice
necessary for victory.
MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS :
The issue is clear. With united will My.peoples here and overseas have
dedicated themselves to the struggle. The spontaneous decision of My Dominions
to participate in the conflict and the invaluable help which they are giving, and
are about to give, to the common cause have been of the greatest encouragement
to Me. With the aid of our faithful French and Polish allies we cannot doubt
that our cause will prevail.
I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
