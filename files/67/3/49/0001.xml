Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
I C I R C U L A T E to my colleagues a telegram from His Majesty's Ambassador
in Washington on the subject of the attitude of the American Zionist
Organisation towards the Palestine policy of His Majesty's Government, together
with the drafts of two telegrams which I would propose to send to Lord Lothian
in reply unless any comments on their terms are received from my colleagues
by 10 A.M. on the 23rd December. These drafts do not lay down any new policy
or principle.

The Marquess of Lothian to Viscount Halifax. (Received December 8.)
(No. 33. Saving.)
(Telegraphic.) En clair. Washington, November 24, 1939.
D E L E G A T I O N from American Zionist organisation came to see me this
morning to say that there was rising disquiet in American Jewry at apparently
well-authenticated rumours that Jewish immigration to Palestine, as provided
for under white paper, was to be restricted, and that restriction of land sales, as
recommended in Woodhead Report, was being carried out. They believe that
there has been informal promise that the 25,000 immigrants over and above
10,000 a year provided for in the white paper were to be admitted during the
first year. I said that I had no knowledge about their complaints, that I doubted
if last point was correct, and pointed out the importance of Great Britain keepingsympathy
of Arab and Moslem world if primary object of overthrowing Hitlerism
was to be achieved.
10775 [20508] B
fice can give me any information which will dispel these
suspicions I should be grateful. Jewish influence is a powerful factor in this
countiT Except for the controversy over the white paper, i t is friendly to Britain
and oYcomse vehemently anti-Hitler. It is naturally m a restless state owing to
stead?^ worsening of t l i position of the J e w s . i n Eastern Europe and
steattv " O i s e m u K i I j position to reassure it about policy h l d b
Weizmann is expected in about three weeks.

Draft Telegram to the Marquess of Lothian (Washington).
(No. .) Foreign Office, December , 1939.
YOUE telegram No. 33, Saving, [of 24th November : A t t i t u d e of Jews in
United States of America to " White Paper " policy of His Majesty's Government
for Palestine].
There is no ground for belief that total immigration to be allowed during
five years following appearance of White Paper in May 1939 is to be reduced
below figure of 75,000 provided that the criterion of "economic absorptive
capacity ' ' permits of that figure, but equally none for belief that any undertaking
was ever given t h a t whole of the 25,000 refugees comprised in t h a t figure would
necessarily be admitted during first year. It is, however, a fact that, on account
of the large numbers of illegal immigrants who reached Palestine during the past
summer (all of whom have to be deducted from the annual quotas), no quota was
issued in respect of the six-monthly period which began on 1st October last.
2. As regards land sales, the White Paper does not enter into details, but
says that High Commissioner will be given general powers to prohibit and
regulate transfers of land as may from time to time be necessary in order to ensure
that Arab cultivators maintain their existing standard of life and that a landless
Arab population is not created. The apprehensions of the American Zionists no
doubt arise from the knowledge t h a t the High Commissioner has under consideration
the early enactment of legislation under these general powers.
3. It will be seen from paragraph 17 of the White Paper that, while the
nature and extent of the prohibition or regulation of land sales is a matter upon
which His Majesty's Government are free to modify their views and may from
time to time see fit to do so, the principle is one from which it is impossible for His
Majesty's Government, for the reasons given below, to depart in any way.
4. The White Paper, which was a settlement imposed by His Majesty's
Government upon Arabs and Jews alike after they had failed to come to any
agreement among themselves, was the outcome of prolonged and anxious deliberation,
and was issued after the claims of both Arabs and Jews had been exhaustively
considered. It declares (in connexion with detailed proposals for
constitutional development) that H i s Majesty's Government desire the establish ment
of an independent Palestine State, in which the essential interests of both
Jews and Arabs shall be safeguarded, and hope this will come about within
ten years. It also declares (in connexion with the immigration proposals already
mentioned) that His Majesty's Government are satisfied that when the five-year
immigration plan has been carried out, they will not be justified in facilitating,
nor will they be under any obligation to facilitate, the further development of
the Jewish National Home by immigration, regardless of the wishes of the Arab
population. Thirdly, it deals with the land sales also mentioned above. In the
concluding paragraph it declares that His Majesty's Government cannot hope
to satisfy the partisans on either side, but that their purpose is to be just as
between the two.
5. In fact, the White Paper constitutes a formal and public declaration of
what constitutes, in the considered opinion of His Majesty's Government and in
the absence of direct agreement between the parties, the most just solution of
the Palestine problem, and they have resisted, and mean to continue to resist,
pressure from either party to modify that solution.
6. So far as the Arabs are concerned, they have as a whole refused to
accept the White Paper, partly because of the continuing Jewish immigration
and partly because the establishment of an independent Palestinian State at
the end of ten years is dependent upon conditions and safeguards which, in
their view, make this prospect illusory. Seeing how completely the White Paper
removes the Arab fear of ultimate Jewish domination, this criticism may seem
unreasonable; and there is, unfortunately, ground for thinking that it is the
outcome not so much of objection to the White Paper proposals in themselves,
as of a belief that in the face of Jewish opposition His Majesty's Government
will fail to carry them out, this belief being based on the idea, however mistaken,
that in the past His Majesty's Government have admitted various Arab claims
to be just and have then abandoned them as the result of Jewish protests.
7. There have anyhow been repeated attempts by the Arab States and
others since the White Paper appeared to induce His Majesty's Government
to " clarify " its provisions so as to make it clear that the safeguards attached
to ultimate Palestinian independence will not be used as excuses to postpone
the achievement of that independence. In recent months these attempts have
been backed by the argument that Palestine is the one question which separates
Great Britain and the Arabs, and that its elimination is essential in order that
there may be whole-hearted co-operation in the defeat of Germany, which is
accepted by responsible Arabs as being important for them as well as for Great
Britain. But in spite of the value to Great Britain of the support of the Arab
world in the present conflict, His Majesty's Government have declined to whittle
down the White Paper, because they realise that to do so would be to perpetrate
an injustice and that once the process had begun there might be no means to
end it before the whole Palestine problem had relapsed into the state of uncertainty
which has -already caused so much loss and misery. They have, instead,
pointed out that the White Paper offers a road to independence and that it
depends upon the Arabs themselves to create conditions in which it must inevitably
be achieved.
8. But the attitude which His Majesty's Government have adopted towards
the Arabs, they must also adopt towards the Jews. The inability of the Jews
to accept any proposals which set a permanent limitation upon the extension of
the Jewish National Home is understandable. But that cannot alter the
conclusion which has already been quoted, that His Majesty's Government would
not be justified in facilitating its further development by immigration regardless
of the wishes of the Arab population.
9. Moreover, as in the case of the Arabs, His Majesty'^ Government cannot
whittle down the White Paper in regard to immigration or in any other respect
because of or in order to secure Jewish support in the war. His Majesty's
Government realise to the full the value of Jewish support, especially in the
United States of America, and they are, of course, grateful to those Jews who,
even though they are not Allied nationals, yet feel impelled to support the Allied
Cause. But they would not like to feel that this support was being given for any
other reason but that the Jews concerned share the ideals for which the Allies
arefighting, and realise that it is in the interest of the Jews of the world that
the Allies should win. There must be no misunderstanding as to the possibility
of rewards, whether in the form of further immigration into Palestine or
otherwise.
10. That any such misunderstandings should be avoided is in fact of the
utmost importance. The unhappy misunderstandings which arose out of the last
war must be avoided at all costs. The principal Zionist leaders in this country
have, indeed, stated repeatedly that their support is unconditional. But I have
nevertheless all along had a feeling that there must be large numbers of their
followers in all countries who believe that, if the Jews support the Allies, His
Majesty's Government will feel obliged, in common decency, so to speak, to
retract the White Paper policy. This feeling has been reinforced by the
telegrams from leading American Zionists to the Prime Minister, the Colonial
Secretary and Mr. Winston Churchill, of which the text is contained in my
immediately following telegram.
11. His Majesty's Government have so far refrained from making any
general declaration in the sense of paragraph 9 above, since such a declaration,
[ 2 0 5 0 8 ] B 2
if made gratuitously, might appear as an uncalled-for rebuff to Jewish
enthusiasm. But in the case of the telegram from Mr. Brandeis and his friends,
as well as of the representations which Your Excellency has received from the
American Zionists, it seems essential t h a t as a matter of good f a i th His Majesty's
Government should leave no room for misapprehension.
12. I shall accordingly be glad if you will reply to Dr. Brandeis in the
following sense :
(a) (With reference to passage beginning " A m e r i c a n Jewry had reason to
believe . . . . " ) . The policy embodied in the White Paper began
to take effect as soon as t h a t policy received the approval of Parliament
and no official statement has been made in Parliament or elsewhere
which could possibly justify the assumption, either before or after
the outbreak of war, that the implementation of the new policy would
be deferred.
(b) (With reference to passage beginning " such action would be
contrary . . .") It is not clear what declaration by the Colonial
Secretary the signatories have in mind, but it is assumed that they
mean the undertaking given by His Majesty's Government to refer
again to Parliament if, as a result of discussion by the League
Council, an amendment to the Mandate should be thought necessary
or desirable. That undertaking was not intended (and cannot, in the
view of His Majesty's Government, be read) as a pledge that the
implementation of the White Paper would be held up pending a
discussion by the League Council. The implementation of the policy
had begun before the outbreak of war, and the indefinite postponement
of the meeting of the Council does not affect the position.
(c) (With reference to " e a s i n g the burdens of the Jewish people.") His
Majesty's Government are now engaged in war with Nazi Germany,
and the defeat of Germany will be their supreme contribution towards
relieving the victims of persecution.
13. With regard to (c) I would add that His Majesty's Government have
naturally every sympathy with all victims of Nazi cruelty, and are doing their
utmost through the various refugee organisations to assist them in their misfortune.
But Palestine could not, in any circumstances, afford a refuge for any
but a small percentage of the Jewish victims, and meanwhile His Majesty's
Government are engaged in a life and death struggle with Germany. It is wholly
unreasonable of the Zionists to expect t h a t even if no question of breaking faith
were involved. His Majesty's Government should, for this small percentage,
prejudice their whole position in the Middle East, and with it the prospects of
common victory which alone can help the great majority of the victims.
14. I do not, however, wish it to be thought that the White Paper policy
was originally adopted, or is now being followed, because of the danger, serious
though that may be, to which -any other policy might expose His Majesty's
Government in the Middle East. The White Paper policy is based primarily
and fundamentally on the conviction of His Majesty's Government that it
represents a just settlement between the conflicting claims of Arab and Jews in
Palestine, and that, subject to the five-year plan, the National Home has now
reached dimensions where its further extension by immigration cannot be achieved
without serious injustice in the absence of the acquiescence of the other
inhabitants of Palestine.
15. I shall be glad if your Excellency will make what use you think
desirable of the contents of this telegram in explaining the position of His
Majesty's Government to the United States Government, the Zionists or anyone
else, bearing always in mind that His Majesty's Government cannot admit that
Jewish support establishes any claim for subsequent reward at their hands and
subject to proviso that (except in confidence to State Department) nothing should
be said on lines of last p a r t of paragraph 6 o r any mention of Arab States made
in connexion with p a r a g r a p h 7; nor is it desirable to say too much about value
of Arab support lest this get back to Arabs and give them too great an idea of
their own importance.
16. I should hope that if His Majesty's Government are frank with the
American Zionists over this question, they may still expect and receive their
support. But even if this is not so there can be no question of the path which
His Majesty's Government must follow.
17. I am arranging for you to be kept informed of developments in Palestine
policy, but you will realise that if little information has seemed to reach you
recently on this question, it has been because there has been little to send. The
American Zionists are in reality upset, not because His Majesty's Government
propose to change their policy, but because they refuse to do so.

"Convey to you our anxious concern at reported intention Palestine
Government proceed implementation White Paper policy despite war
situation. American Jewry had reason to believe that in this critical hour

of World Jewry such action would be contrary to spirit of Colonial
Secretary's declaration in Commons in view postponement consideration by

relying upon the Balfour declaration, has invested vast fortunes in the
upbuilding of Palestine, and is called upon this year for even larger sums
as a result of war situation earnestly plead for reassurance to allay our
apprehensions and ease burden of Jewish people victimised by Nazi
barbarism and whose only hope of healing and restoration lies in the development
of the Jewish national home in Palestine.
