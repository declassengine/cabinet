REPORT OF FOOD POLICY SUB-COLdviITTEE
OF HOME POLICY COMMITTEE.
ON
(A) HOME FOOD PRODUCTION POLICY.
and
(B) BREWING AND DISTILLING IN WAR TIME.
Some Food 1 . In pursuance of paragraph 1 2 of our Report'of 2 n d
Production
icy. December, (Paper No, IV. P. (G) ( 3 9 ) 1 2 9 ) we submit to the Home
Policy Committee and to the ./ar Cabinet our conclusions on
the question of increased home food production in 19h0.
This question has been reviewed by the Official Sub-Committee
whose findings and suggestions are set out in the Memorandum
attached hereto as Appendix I.
2 . The Official Sub-Committee's appreciation of the
position may be briefly summarised as follows. The total j
home production of meat and mills: cannot be expanded in 1 9 k 0,
The best that can be hoped, for is to maintain the existing
levels of milk and beef production. The maintenance or '
increase of the sheep population is largely dependent on the
prices for mutton and wool. The numbers of pigs and poultry
must be reduced owing to shortage of cereal feeding stuffs.
3. On the other hand the production of crops, including
grass can be substantially increased in 19k0 by concentrating
on the ploughing up of as much as possible of the 7,000,000
acres of second and third rate grasslands below the 700
feet contour line. Subject to certain conditions mentioned
in paragraph 5 of Appendix I being satisfied, and in the

main this will depend on the level of agricultural prices,
-it is estimated that 2,000,000 of the 7,000,000 acres of poor
grassland could he ploughed up for the 19U0 harvest. It is
not thought that it would be possible to secure the ploughing
up of appreciably more than 2,000,000 acres for the 1 9 1 +0
harvest without adopting drastic measures such as the
conscription of labour for work on the land which could only
be justified if we were faced with an extreme crisis, i.e. a
complete blockade of our ports. vie agree that the programme
should aim at the ploughing up of 2,000,000 acres as a
minimum, and we are satisfied that the objective is more
likely to be secured by agreement than by resort to any
measures of compulsion.
k. In paragraphs 5 - 8 of their Memorandum the Official
Sub-Committee discussed the divergent opinions held as to the
use to which the ploughed up land should be put and the crops
which should be grown upon it and on the existing arable land
to meet war time needs. These views are:(
1) that in war time agricultural policy should
concentrate on the maximum production of wheat
and potatoes for human consumption:
(2) that in war time the most desirable objective of
the food production campaign should be not so
much to produce the particular crops which give
the maximum possible quantity of food measured
in calories per acre (i.e. wheat and potatoes)
but rather to save as much shipping space as
possible and.at the same time to increase, if
practicable, or at any rate to continue the
production of those staple foods, the normal
importation- of which we are likely to have the
most difficulty in maintaining. x n short,

- 3 case
of potatoes it is essential that an ass ranee should he
given, not only that the growers wil:I receive an attractive
minimum price, hut that the uinistry of Pood will take over
the surplus of the crop, if any.
8." We agree with the Official Sub-Committee that a
moderate improvement in the level of prices is essential if
the policy we recommend is to be successful, and in this
connection we would draw particular attention to the considerations
set out in paragraphs 10-12 of Appendix I.
9i The financial implications of the proposals have been
reserved for the consideration of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer but subject thereto we think it very desirable
that a statement covering as much as possible of the home
production scheme should be made in Parliament on Thursday
next, December 14th., and we hope that the Minister of
Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for
Scotland will be able to circulate to the War Cabinet for
consideration on that day the draft of a Statement agreed
"by them and the Lord Privy Seal in consultation, specially
as regards the financial aspects of the scheme, with the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, If the War Cabinet adopt the
policy embodied in this Statement it will be for the
Agricultural Departments, the Ministry of Pood and the
Treasury^ to negotiate and approve increases in prices of
the approved order.

10. We also agree that it will he necessary to
ensure to farmers, whether the War ends in 1940 or not,
a guaranteed, market for the extra production which they
are being called upon to undertake in regard to their
staple cash crops and further, to assure them that the
transition from war-time to peace-time conditions will be
effected with full regard to the necessity for avoiding
sudden and drastic changes in agricultural policy.
11. In paragraph 14 of Appendix I the Official Sub-
Committee urge that County War Agricultural Executive
Committees should be authorised to undertake cultivations
on behalf of farmers who are not themselves in a position
to finance the necessary initial outlay beyond the limit
of &#163;2 per acre, and to recover their expenditure after the
harvest. We agree and recommend that this proposal be
approved.
12. In the following paragraph (15) the Official Sub-
Committee say that it is regarded as essential to prevent
any further men who may be certified by the County
Committees as needed for the fulfilment of the food production
campaign being withdrawn from agriculture by the
Fighting Services during at least the next 9 months.
We strongly endorse this proposal and our Chairman, has
conveyed our representations on the subject to the M i n i s t er
of Labour, the Chairman of the Man Power Committee.
13-. We concur with the view of the Official Sub-
Committee that it is also desirable to take the subsidiary
measures indicated in paragraph 16 of Appendix I.

Prying and
War Time,.
14.. We attach (iA^jrjendix."II) a Report hy the
Official Sub-Committee on Brewing and Distilling in
War-time,with the recommendations of which we are in
agreement.
1 5 , Our recommendations to the Home Policy Committee
and the War Cabinet may he summarised as follows;-
Home Pood Production Pol icy.-
That the proposals contained in Appendix I
for increasing home food production in 1940 and
thereafter should be approved in principle, and in
partic ular
(a) That approval should be given to the
scheme for ploughing up at least.
2,000,000 acres of second and third
rate grasslands with a view to their
being sewn to crops or reseeded straight
away to good grass leyso
(b) That the policy should be directed to a
general increase of productivijg related
to our present farming systems/outlined
in paragraphs 6-8 of Appendix Ik
(c) That if this policy is to be successful
it is essential that there should be a
moderate improvement in the general price
level as explained in paragraphs 10-12
of Appendix D
(d) That it will also be necessary to ensure
to farmers, whether the war ends in 1940 or
not, a guaranteed market for the extra
production which they are being called upon
to undertake in regard to their staple cash
crops, and further to assure them that the
transition from war-time to peace-time
conditions will be effected with full regard
to the necessity for avoiding sudden and
drastic changes in agricultural policyo
Agricultural
(e) That the County/Committees should be authorised
to undertake cultivations on behalf of
farmers who are unable to finance the necessary
initial outlay, beyond the limit of &#163;2
an acre and to recover their expenditure after
the harvest0
(f) That the measures in paragraph 16 of Appendix
I should also be adopted, viz:

(i) drainage of land which is potentiallyfertile
hut is at present waterlogged;
(ii) authority to County War Agricultural
Executive Committees on a more general
scale than hitherto to undertake or
finance the cultivation of areas of
derelict or semi-derelict 3iand which
are to be found in many counties;
(iii) special measures in aid of hill sheep
farmers, including firm assurances a s to
the price of wool in 1940, and possibly
special assistance in regard to improvement
of pastures;
(iv) the continuation of the &#163;2 an acre subsidy
for ploughing-up permanent grassland beyond
31st0 March, 1940;? with a v:i ew to a further
expansion of production for the harvest of
1941.
( g ) That a statement in the form agreed by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer? the Lord Privy-
Seal and the Agricultural Ministers, covering
a s much as possible of the home production
policy,should be submitted to the War Cabinet
for approval on December 14th0, with a view to
its being announced in Parliament later on that
day.
Brewing and Distilling: in War-timec
(l) That it is at present inexpedient on social
and other grounds to reduce the supply of
barley needed by the brewing industry, and that
supplies of barley should be made available to
that industry sufficient to enable it to maintain,
during the brewing year ending 30th September,
o
1940, the same rate of output as during the year
ended 30th September, 1939. The use of maize^ o
however, for brewing should be prohibitedo
(ii) That in order to safeguard the seed position in
1940 steps should be taken to obtain a lien on
some part of the stocks of home-grown barley,
suitable for seed purposes; already purchased by
brewers or maltsters-, Any stocks of barley taken
for this purpose should be replaced in due course
by imported barley
c
(iii) That in view of the serious shortage of feeding
stuffs the amount of grain made available to distilleries
during the 12 months ending 30th.
September, 1940., should be limited to such
quantities as will enable the distilleries to
produce in that period one-third of the quantity
of whisky and other potable spirits produced in
the 12 months ended 30th. September, 1939. This
rate of production would be sufficient to safeguard
future export requirements0

(j IJ (j
(iv) That the Ministry of Food should he
authorised to bring supplies ot home-grown
barley under full control as soon as
possible, in order to achieve these objectives,
as well as to control the amount of
barley purchased by brewers and distillers
for carry-over into the year 1940/41, and
to facilitate the direction of barley supplies
into the appropriate channels.
(v) That the form of control should empower the
Ministry of Food to acquire distillers'
existing stocks of barley and maize to the
extent that they are in excess of their
estimated needs (as defined in (iii) above),
f
and alsos 4 necessary, to acquire stocks of
barley in the hands of brewers, maltsters
and merchants to the extent that those
stocks may prove to be in excess of requirements
for this season's brewing and for a
reasonable carry-over for the 1940-1
season,
(vi) That Ministry of Food should consider in
consultation with the other Departments
concerned the question of making gin from
potato and other spirit in order to prevent
the depletion of existing stocks of maturing
whisky.

HOME POLICY COMMITTEE
MINISTERIAL... SUB-COMMITTEE ON POOL POT-IOY
HOME FOOD PRODUCTION PGLICY
Memorandum by the Official jhxjj^cam;:? t toe on Food- Po] Ley.
I * The basir and r-pndl tions of Increased production
1. It is not possible to expand the total production of
moat and mi lie in 1940. The cattle population (i.e. milk and
bwef) ptannot bo increased substantially within the period of
a throo-years1 war. Probably tho best that can ba hoped for
is to maintain existing production of milk and beof. It
would be possible to achieve a moderate increase in the
sheep population. The question of maintaining or increasing
the sheep population is largely dependent on prices for
mutton and wool. In this connection it must he mentioned
that the sheep and wool prices prevailing in recent years
have seriously undermined the hill sheep farming industry In
See island. It is feared that shortage of cash and credit
will lead to economies in labour and other expenditure which
aro bound not only to prevent any expansion in the industry
but to involva reductions through losses of lambs, disease
and deterioration of grazings. The numbers of pigs and
poultry will have to be reduced. The extent of the reduction
depends on the supplies of cereals available for feeding them.
2. What can be increased in 1940 is the production of crops
including grass. Our present arable acroage (9,000,000 acres)
has as high an average yield per acre as at any previous period,
Cur first class grassland provides large quantities of food
Per acre for cattle and sheep. It is tho millions of acres
of second and third rate grasslands which hayo shown such a
lamentable decline in productivity during the last 60 years.

9 9 &#163;
6 6 9;
A recent survey undertaken on "behalf of the Ministry indicates
that there are cc least 7,000,000 acres below the 700 ft.
contour line the productivity of which could be greatly
increased if they were ploughed up and sown to crops or
re-seeded straight away to good grass leys. iny campaign
to increase home food production must be directed to
ploughing up as much as possible of these second and third
rate grasslands.
3 . The ploughing-up campaign involves a great deal of
re-planning by formers of their whole farming systems for a
period of years ahoad. In deciding now how muoh grassland
to plough up and what crops to grow for the 1940 harvest, a
farmer- is largely committing himself to what he will have
to grow in 1941 and what livestock it would be necessary or
possible for him to keep in 1941 and 1942. Any programme for
expanding production should therefore have an objective which
farmers can easily understand; it should give as much latitude
to farmers as possible- so that it can be applied to the
different systems and circumstances of hundreds of thousands
of farms, and it should be one which farmers are satisfied
can be pursued without violent changes over a period of years.
4. The extent to which land can be ploughed up so as to
increase production depends on
(a) farmers having moro money ^in cash or credit)
to finance the extra production;
(b) an adequate incentive for the farmer to change
his farming system and to increase production.
For the reasons indicated in paragraph 3, this
incentive must be one whi eh will enable him to
see his way through the hazards of 2 or 3 years.
(c) adequate labour being available. This cannot
be ensured unless agricultural wages are raised
to a level oloser to wages in other occupations
which are increasingly drawing men off the land.

(d) adequate supplies of" machinery/, fertilisers,
seeds ete., heing available .
On certain assumptions as to these conditions being
satisfied, it was estimated before the war
that 2,000,000 acres of grassland in the United Kingdom
could be ploughed up for the 1940 harvest. The last
ef the above conditions can probably be fulfilled.
The others mainly depend on the level of agricultural
prices. The agricultural price level is indeed the crux
the whole problem of securing the additional production at
which we are aiming.
ii * ThQ i.rQPogQi procuoti on poiiav
c. While there is no dispute as to the need for
increasing production by ploughing-up grassland, there
is considerable divergence of opinion as to the use to
which the ploughed-up land should "be put end the crops
which should be grown on this lend and on the existing
arable land to meet war time needs.
6. There is a widely held view that agricultural policy
in war time should concentrate on the maximum production
of wheat and potatoes for human consumption. This view
is supported by the following arguments: that broad and
potatoes are the two chief and cheapest forms el' energyproducing
food consumed by the working classes; that 100
acres of land can, if sown to these crops, produce more
food measured by calories than if devoted to any other
purpose; and that accordingly, if we wish to make our
land as productive as possible, we should use it
for the purpose which gives the greatest amount of food
per acre, and be prepared to reduce, not only our pig
and poultry population, which are large consumers cf

9 9 &#163;
Sj fa 0
cereals, "but alec- our cattle and sheen population which
require a oert^ir amount' of cereals or cake in addition
to grass and lay,
Up to a point this argument is sound, V/e can,
and shall, produce larger quantities of both wheat and
potatoes, hut hoyend a certain point concentration on
these two crops is, it is suggested, unnecessary and
undesirable for the following reasons
(i) The situation which our food production policy
is designed, to relieve is one not of a
cessation cf imports of food, but of a reduction
of then cviiUj to a shortage of shipping space.
Imports of wheat of which there are very largo
stocks available to us in America would be the
last t o be- materially reduced, and if v/e were to
reach a point where imports of raw materials
had in effect ceased, cur factories would be
idle, our exports v/ould have disappeared, oar
armaments production would have ceased, and wo
should Ir. fact hive already lost the war,
'.';c should therefore plan home production on
the assumption of being able to import essential
requirements of wheat,
(ii) Moreover, in jrder to maintain the health and
morale of the population under the strain of
war, the object ?f the Government must be to
maintain as far as possible a properly balanced
diet of the kind cf foods to which the population
is accustomed^ The shipping situation requires
a reduction in those imports which are the most
bulky, and it is cereals which, among foodstuffs,

ft
account fee "by far the largest amount of
saipclfg space- Since shipping is the main
difficult;/, it would appear to he just, as
useful to aave the shipping of animal feedingstuff.?
as to save the shipping of wheat, and
indeed it v/ould he more economical in shipping
to deflect it from bringing maize from the
Argentine to bringing wheat from North America,
(iii) The farming system in operation over a largo
part of the country depends on the maintenance
of the cattle and sheep population. In many
cases tee fertility of the land and its ability
to grow I-Ooa crops depend on the maintenance
of adequate numbers of cheep and pattle on
the farm. In many other cases, the lay-out,
buildings, and equipment of the farm are
planned for livestock production, and the
practical knowledge and economic circumstances
of farmers are such that they could not afford
to lose their- livestock and switch over to a
system of farming mainly directed to the
product ion of wheat arid potatoes unless the
price for these two commodities were fixed
at extravagantly high levels. On the
other hand; if remunerative but reasonable
prices are fixed for milk and cattle and sheep,
these farmers could, without undue difficulty,
be induced and enabled to become much more
self-sufficient in animal fcedingstuffs by
ploughing part of their grassland and growing

fodder crops. It is indeed probable that by
giving tho utmost latitude as to the crops
(including leys) to be grown on newly ploughed-up
land and by encouraging the improvement of the
remaining grassland we can not. o n l y keep agriculture
on a properly bail^uwscisystem which -will
net coil-apse at the a na. f t n arv but at the o e W
same time setKure a much greater increase in
productivity at n l o w e r cost to the Exchequer and
to the c c T t s j y n e r .and save more shipping- thah by
concentration o n wheat artu potatoes,
(iv) The need for directing our effort to making
ourselves more self-supporting in animal
feedingstuffs as well as to increasing the
production of wheat and potatoes is supported
b y the facts of the present situation in
regard to the food supplies of the nation.
It is not in fact anticipated that there will
be any difficulty in obtaining adequate
quantities of wheat or potatoes, but there
is a present and prospective shortage of
fats and also of feedingstuffs necessary to
maintain our home production of milk and meat.
As regards potatoes, we normally grew
practically the whole of our peace-time
requirements. In war time we may expect and
should encourage increased consumption. Smxne
increase in acreage and production is therefore
desirable, and in fact we are aiming at an
increase of about 150,000 acres (an increase
of about 25% mn the pre-war acreage undrr
potatoes) in addition to the extra quantities
that will be grown on allotments.

It would, however, he wasteful to expand the production
of potatoes appreciably "beyond what is necessary for the
anticipated human consumption. Although they are a
valuable form of feedingstuffs for livestock, they are
an expensive one, and no farmer would grow ware potatoes
as a fodder crop; it would be much more economical to
grow cereals, peas, beans, kale etc. To secure the
desired expansion of the potato acreage, it will be
necessary for the Government to be prepared to deal with
any surplus, and it would be difficult to justify a policy
under which the Government had deliberately created a
situation leading to the purchase of a large quantity of
ware potatoes at &#163;4 to &#163; 5 a ton (a reasonable price
having regard to costs of production) and the resale of
them to farmers at say &#163; 2 a ton (which is what they are
worth as a feedingstuff for animals). While the human
consumption of potatoes could to some extent be increased
by low retail prices or by a publicity campaign in their
favour, a sufficient expansion of consumption to absorb a
large increase in production could only be ensured by
(a) a decision - if needed - to make it obligatory to
include a certain quantity of potato flour in the loaf this
would involve an admission that the Government was
unable to import sufficient quantities of wheat, and
might be difficult politically - and (b) the provision of
factories and machinery for oonverting potatoes into flour.
7. For all these reasons it is believed that the
most desirable objective of the food production campaign
should be not so much to seek to produce the particular
crops which give the maximum possible quantity of food
measured in calories per acre, i.e. not to concentrate
our effort on the production of increased quantities of
wheat and potatoes, but rather to save as much shipping
space as possible, and at the same time to increase if
practicable, or at any rate to continue, the production of
those staple foods the normal importation of which we are
- 7 likely
to have most difficulty in maintaining. To give
effect to this objective our policy should be to increase
the general productivity of our land having regard to the
soil and climatic and ether conditions of each particular
farm and the farming system carried on upon it,
S. While of course the extent and effect of any
agricultural programme is largely dependent on the weather,
the extra production to be expected from the ploughing-up
of 2,000,000 acres of grassland and pursuing the policy
outlined above is indicated in the following table. It
must be emphasised that the individual items are subject to
wide variation and that the table as a whole is onlyintended
to give a general picture of the scale and
character of the possible increased production and is no
mare than a rough estimate:tons

For estimating feeding values of various crops it
is usual to express them in terms of " starch equivalent".
The above items taken together represent 1,356,000 tons of
starch equivalent. The same amount of starch equivalent
would be provided by 1,894,000 tons of wheat or 1,747,000 ton
of maize, i.e. if the above extra quantities of food and
feedingstuffs are produced from home sources the demand on
shipping space would be reduced by nearly 2,000,000 tons.
We should also be in a better position to maintain our home
production of livestock and livestock products and pro tanto
avoid the need for increased imports of meat and fats.

It is believed that by a. policy of this kind,
directed ta a general increase of productivity related to
our present farming systems it would be possible to save
m*re shipping than by a policy which concentrated on the
increased production of wheat and potatoes.
9. It is not considered that it would be possible
tA secure the ploughing-up of appreciably more than two
million acres for the harvest of 1940 without adopting
drastic measures such as the conscription of labour for
work on the land, ?/hich could only be justified if we
were faced with extreme crisis, i.e. a complete blockade
of our ports,
10, The programme of ploughing-up two million acres
with a view to an expansion of production on the lines
indicated may he regarded as a reasonable measure cf
insurance against a possible shortage of imports in
1940/41. A moderate improvement in the general price
level and some measure of security for a period of 2 or
3 years, coupled with the fear of a shortage of imported
feedingstuffs, is likely to promote a greater expansion
cf total production than any special inducement to expand
production of particular crops. The increase in the level
of prices must be sufficient to enable higher wages to be
paid to agricultural workers so as to retard the drift
from the land, to cover *ther increases in costs and also to
provide an incentive to farmers to change their farming
systems and to increase prodxiction.
11. It is extremely difficult to forecast the
movement of costs for as far ahead as next autumn, but on
the basis of present facts and expectations, it is
considered by the Agricultural Departments that increases
*n prices already in operation or agreed varying between
7&#189; per cent, and 15 per cent, wculd be required to secure

secure the desired result. Increases in prices of
livestock and milk would need to become operative within
the next few weeks and would probably amount to the
equivalent of two points on the cost of living figure.
Increased prices of cash crops, namely, wheat, potatoes
and sugar beet, to be harvested in 1940 would not, of
course, operate until the autumn of 1940. An increase of
about 10 per cent, in the prices received by farmers for
wheat and sugar beet would affect the cost of living
figure as from that date by one or two points. As regards
potatoes, in view of the wide margin between growers'
prices and retail prices, the provision of an attractive
minimum price for the growers need not have any appreciable
effect on retail prices, but an essential feature in
connection with the potato crop is an assurance that the
Ministry of Pood will take charge of any surplus, an
operation which might involve a charge on Ministry of Pood
funds or on the consumer. It is not possible to frame
any estimate of what this charge might be in view of the
uncertainty as to the acreage to be sown and the eventual
yield per acre.
12. It does not appear to be necessary for the
Government to take any action about the prices of other
agricultural commodities, except to continue the present
principle of price insurance for barley and oats at
suitable levels and possibly to control the prices of
feeding barley and oats in order to prevent a disproportionate
rise.
13. If it is considered necessary to insure our
food supplies from the harvest of 1940 onwards by
increasing home food production to the extent of the
existing programme set out above, the Agricultural Departments,
the Ministry of Pood and the Treasury should be
authorised to negotiate and approve increases in
prices of the order indicated above in paragraph 11

It will also be necessary to ensure to farmers, whether
the war ends in 1940 or not, a guaranteed market for
the extra production which they are being called upon
to undertake and to give a further assurance to the
industry that the transition from war-time to peacetime
conditions will be effected with full regard to
the necessity for avoiding sudden and drastic changes
in agricultural policy.
14. It may also be necessary to authorise County
War Agricultural Executive Committees to undertake
cultivations on behalf of farmers who are not themselves
in a position to finance the necessary initial outlay.
An arrangement of this sort is already in operation in
connection with the ploughing-up of seven year old
grassland which will Qualify for the &#163;2 per acre subsidy
The subsidy, or the appropriate part of it, is earmarked
for the purpose of recouping the Committee. A great
deal of work, which could not otherwise be done, could
be put in hand if County Committees were authorised
to undertake cultivations on behalf of farmers beyond
the limit of &#163;2 per acre, and to recover their
expenditure after the harvest.
15. It is regarded as essential to prevent any
further men who may be certified by the County War
Agricultural Executive Committees as needed for the
fulfilment of the food production campaign being
withdrawn from agriculture by the Fighting Services
during at least the next 9 months.
16. Further steps which it is desirable to take
are
(i) drainage of land which is potentially
fertile, but is at present waterlogged;

(ii) authority to Country War Agricultural
Executive Committees on a more general
scale than hitherto to undertake or
finance the cultivation of areas of
derelict or semi-derelict land which
are to he found in many counties;
(iii) Special measures in aid of hill sheep
farmers, including firm asstirances as
to the price of wool in 1940, and
possibly special assistance in regard
to improvement of pastures;
(iv) the continuation of the &#163;2 an acre subsidy
for ploughing-up permanent grassland beyond
31st March, 1940, with a view to a further
expansion of production for the harvest
of 1941.
17. The financial implications of the main proposal
in this memorandum and of the subsidiary points raised
in paragraph 16 have not yet been submitted to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer who wishes to have an
opportunity of considering the report with any recommendations
which the Pood Policy Committee may see fit to
make about it before it comes before the War Cabinet.

WAR CABINET.
HOME POLICY COMMITTEE.
MINISTERIAL SUB-COMMITTEE ON FOOD POLICY.
BREWING AND DISTILLING IN WAR TIME.
Report by the Official Sub-Conanlttee on Food Policy.
The official Siib-Committee on Pood Policy have
considered the Report submitted by the Inter-Departmental
Committee on Brewing and Distilling in War-time set up on
the instance of the War Cabinet (Paper No. F.P.(M)(39)4).
2. The Sub-Committee have also taken into account
information collected by the Ministry of Food which became
available after the date of the Inter-Departmental
Committee's Report, and which shows that there was an
abnormally large carry-over of stocks of barley from the
previous season. Stocks of barley of the 1938 crop, and
of malt made from barley of that crop, in the ownership
of brewers and maltsters on 25th November amounted to the
equivalent of 225,000 tons of barley. The Inter-
Departmental Committee had estimated (Paragraph 27 of
their Report) that the carry-over at the beginning of
the season was about 100,000 tons. While this
unexpected addition to the supplies of barley available
considerably improves the outlook for seed, it does
not in our view render necessary any revision of the
general conclusions reached by the Committee.
3. The Sub-Committee have agreed upon the following
recommendations 9
9 &#163;
fj O 0
(i) Tha-t-it is at present inexpedient on
social and other grounds to reduce the supply of
-barley needed by the brewing industry, and that
supplies of barley should be made available to
t h a t industry sufficient to enable it to maintain,
during the brewing year ending 30th September, 1940,
t h e same rate of output as during the year ended
3 0 t h September, 1939, The use of maize, however,
f o r brewing should be prohibited.
(ii) That in order to safeguard the seed
position in 1940 steps should be taken to obtain
ealienon some part of the stocks of home-grown
barley, suitabj e for seed purposes, already
purchased by brewers or maltsters. Any stocks
o f barley taken for this purpose should be
replaced in due course by imported, barley.
(iii) That in view of the serious shortage of
feeding stuffs the amount of grain made available
t o distilleries during the 12 months ending
3 0 t h September, 1940, should be limited to such
quantities as will enable the distilleries to
produce in that period one-third of the quantity
o f whisky and other potable spirits produced in the
1 2 months ended 30th September, 1939. This rate
o f production would be sufficient to safeguard
future export requirements.
(iv) That the Ministry of Pood should be
authorised to bring supplies of home-grown barley
under full control as soon as possible, in order
t o achieve these objectives, as well as to control

the amount of barley purchased by brewers
and distillers for carry-over into the year
1940/41, and to facilitate the direction of
barley supplies into the appropriate channels.
(v) That the form of control should empower
the Ministry of Pood to acquire distillers'
existing stocks of barley and. maize to the
extent that they are in excess of their estimated
needs (as defined in (iii) above),and also, if
necessary, to acquire stocks of barley in the
hands of brewers, maltsters and. merchants to
the extent that those stocks may prove to be
in excess of requirements for this seasonfs
brewing and for a reasonable carry-over for the
1940-1 season.
(vi) That Ministry of Pood shoxild consider
in consultation with the other Departments
concerned the question of nuking gin from
potato and other spirit in order to prevent
the depletion of existing stocks of maturing
whisky.
