SHIPBUILDING,
MEMORANDUM To the Cabinet from the Minister of Shipping.
In W.P.(G)(39)15 dated 19th September last, the
President of the Board of Trade obtained general Cabinet
authority for placing orders for merchant ships to be built
on Government account on a scale designed to attain an output
both on Government and private account of about 1,000,000
gross tons per annum.
(2) Under the existing allocation of the merchant
shipbuilding yards, the continued demands of the Admiralty
for Naval craft will prevent any higher rate of output being
attained. The present load of Admiralty work in the yards
is about equivalent to the output of 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 gross tons
per annum of merchant ships. It will thus be seen that the
present merchant shipbuilding capacity is about equally
divided between naval and merchant ship requirements.
(3) Output of merchant shipbuilding is likely, however, to
be affected by:(
a) the inclusion of workers below the normal standard
of skill - necessary because of the increased
number of men required;
(b) lighting restrictions which reduce outdoor output
in winter time and affect night shifts in key
departments all through the year;
(c) loss of working time owing to air raid warnings.
Moreover, the output can only be attained if a regular supply
of materials, and particularly steel, can be ensured. An

annual output at the rate of one million gross tons will
only he attained, even by the spring of next year, if no
serious delays arise from any of these causes.
(d) the continuance of conversion work which is still
absorbing labour which otherwise would be engaged
on new construction.
(4) In the first thirteen months of the war (i.e. up to
30th September, 1940). the total output of useful cargo
carrying tonnage likely te come on service is 820,000 gross
tons, being approximately at the rate of 200,000 gross tens
per quarter. The output in the three following quarters
is, upon the present allocation of yards, estimated to be
approximately as follows:-
Quarter ending 31st December 1940 - ^50,000 tons gross
;i 11 11
" 31st March 1941 - 250,000
Vl ,: 11 11
30th June 1941 - 230,000
(5) The limiting factors in shipbuilding are steel supplies
and labour supplies. With regard te steel, while the
above programme demands one-seventeenth of the nation1s
output, it must be borne in mind that 1 ton of steel used
in the construction of a merchant vessel will give, after
approximately 9-12 months, about 12 tons of general
importing capacity per annuifio So long, therefore, as we
are assuming in our general plans that the war will not
terminate within a year there would seem to be an
overwhelming case for steel for shipbuilding receiving
priority over moot ether Government steel requirements,
and this question will bo raised en the appropriate
Committee in clue course. with regard to labour supplies,
owing to practically continuous depression in the industry
since 1926, it is extremely difficult tc secure an
increased labour supply,. It is, however, imperative that
every step be taken to secure as much building as possible

and the question of dilution of labour and the training
of personnel for shipbuilding will receive the urgent
consideration of the Ministry in conjunction with the
Ministry of Labour, the employers and the Trade Unions,
once the supply of materials is ensured.
(6) As regards the type of ships to be built, a
substantial number of tankers, of which few were building
at the outbreak of war was at once ordered, but in view
s
of the chartering of Norwegian tanker tonnage, orders are
at present being concentrated cn cargo vessels, and in
particular on cargo tramps.
(7) Enquiries have been made as to the possibility of
building abroad. Unfortunately, Canadian yards have
built very little except small craft such as tugs and lake
steamers since the last war, and little immediate help can
be expected from that quarter. United States yards are
understood to be substantially filled with their own orders
and oosts are very high. Enquiries are being pursued in
jMvth countries. Invest-i gat ions have also been made as to
Italian yards, but Great Britain would have to find the
ste.el.
(8) There are, however, two yards in Hong Kong which have
been accustomed to build ocean-going steamers and
negotiations are proceeding with a view to placing orders
for four vessels.
( 9 ) A detailed statement showing anticipated output of
different types of vessels and their tonnage for the
period to 30th June, 194-1, is annexed.
