WAR CABINET.
ARMS FOR YUGOSLAVIA.
Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum on the Yugoslav mineral
monopoly and the supply of arms to Yugoslavia which has been prepared in the
Foreign Office. The Treasury, the War Office, the Ministry of Economic Warfare
and the Ministry of Supply have expressed their concurrence in this memorandum.

Foreign Office, November 25, 1939.
YUGOSLAV MINERAL MONOPOLY AND THE SUPPLY OF ARMS TO
YUGOSLAVIA.
By a Royal Decree dated the 11th November, the Yugoslav Government have
set up a commissariat for the control of mineral production in Yugoslavia. The
object of this decree is to make available for the Yugoslav Government the whole
mineral resources of their country for the purpose of obtaining, by barter, the
armaments which they require for the defence of Yugoslavia. As it has so far
been impossible for His Majesty's Government or the French Government to
supply the necessary arms, the effect of the decree may be that large quantities
of Yugoslav minerals will be sold to Germany in return for German armaments.
Several considerations make this a matter of great concern to His Majesty's
Government. In the first place the minerals principally concerned : lead, copper,
chrome and antimony, are of high value for the Germans and cannot be obtained
in adequate quantities by Germany elsewhere. In the second place, these minerals
are urgently required by the Allies for their own uses. If the French Government
cannot obtain the copper which they require from the Mine de Bor, the Ministry
of Supply fear that, under the new pooling of resources, His Majesty's Government
will be obliged to supply copper to France from elsewhere. Thirdly, the
French and British Governments are intimately concerned in so far as this new
Governmental control of mines threatens to deprive the British and French
companies who own and work mines in Yugoslavia of their right to dispose of
the output of the mines in the best market, and also compels them to abandon to
the Yugoslav State all sterling or other foreign currency earned as a result of
soles abroad. The most important British concerns are the Trepca lead mining
company, the Central European Mines, which also produce lead, the Allatini
10723 [20375]
chrome mine and the Podrinje antimony mine. The French Mine de Bor is the
principal copper mine. Lastly, it is to the advantage of His Majesty's Government
that Yugoslavia should be adequately armed, since it seems certain that
in no circumstances will their arms be used against us, and we have reason to
believe that in certain circumstances Yugoslavia might come in on our side.
Before the decree was published, His Majesty's Minister in Belgrade made
repeated and urgent representations to the Yugoslav Government in order to
induce them to abandon the proposal, and I interviewed the Yugoslav Minister
for the same purpose. Since its publication a strong protest has been made by
His Majesty's Legation, and I handed a further aide-memoire to the Yugoslav
Minister on the 23rd November protesting on behalf of His Majesty's Government
and reserving the rights of the British companies concerned. These representations
have, it is believed, made the Yugoslav authorities realise that they will be
obliged to operate the control in a manner satisfactory to the British and French
Governments, and negotiations for a settlement will begin on about the
28th November. For this purpose His Majesty's Government propose to send
competent officials (viz., Mr. Nixon of the Export Credits Guarantee Department
and Mr. Harmer of the Ministry of Supply) to Belgrade to assist His Majesty's
Legation. There will, at the same time, be a French trade mission in Belgrade
negotiating a Franco-Yugoslav war trade agreement, and it is proposed that the
question of minerals should be discussed by the two missions side by side.
The principal objectives of the British and French missions, apart from
securing the interests of the British and French companies, will be to ensure that
the control is operated in such a manner that no increased supplies of these
minerals will be delivered to Germany, and that adequate supplies are made
available for allied requirements. It is, however, clear that such a solution cannot
be obtained unless some means can be found of enabling the Yugoslav Government
to obtain elsewhere than in Germany the armaments which they require. The
supply of armaments by France or Great Britain is, in fact, the only effective
method of obtaining the end we seek, since it would remove the chief reason which
at present exists for the supply of minerals to Germany.
The matter was considered by the Allied Demands Committee on the
22nd November, and it is clear that none of the land armaments which the
Yugoslav Government require can be supplied from British and very improbably
from French sources. These are principally tanks, anti-tank guns and antiaircraft
guns, of which supplies for the British and French armies are extremely
short, and of which i t is impossible to hold out any hope whatever of supply to
Yugoslavia. In addition to these land armaments the Yugoslav Government are
in urgent need of further aircraft. They have already been promised, as a result
of a personal undertaking to the Prince Regent, delivery from the United
Kingdom of
12 Hurricane airframes.
50 Mercury V I I I engines.
30 Merlin I I I engines.
20 short-nosed Blenheim aircraft with 40 Mercury V I I I engines.
This represents a very considerable concession on the part of the Air Ministry,
and apart from an additional forty-eight engines Avhich the Yugoslav Government
would like to see delivered during 1940 to be fitted to the airframes which
they are manufacturing in Yugoslavia, it is not felt possible to press for further
releases from the United Kingdom. It has been suggested that the aeronautical
material that we are about to deliver should be held up, and payment in minerals
demanded. The difficulty here is that this material has been ordered by the
Yugoslav Government on the strength of the export ci^edit offered to them by
His Majesty's Government last summer.
The question therefore arises whether it is possible in any way to obtain
aircraft or land armaments for Yugoslavia from some other source. His Majesty's
Government are at pi^esent considering the purchase of considerable quantities
of aircraft and guns from Italy, and the decision of the Cabinet is required
whether in principle it would be possible to hold out to the Yugoslav
Government the possibility of His Majesty's Government arranging to make
available for Yugoslavia some portion of these purchases. In regai'd to anti-tank
guns, which is the most urgent requirement of the Yugoslav Government, it has
been suggested that, if His Majesty's Government are able to effect the purchases
which are at present envisaged from I t a l i a n firms, it might be possible to earmark
a proportion, say, 20 per cent., for Yugoslavia, to be supplied in return for
minerals. A similar arrangement might conceivably be possible in the matter of
aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. If it is felt that the purchases which can be made
in Italy represent the minimum requirements of His Majesty's Government for
their own purposes, the Cabinet might agree that an attempt should be made to
buy for Yugoslavia any suitable armaments which remain available in Italy after
the British purchases have been completed.
A second possibility, on which the decision of the Cabinet in principle
would be appreciated, is that if no armaments or aircraft can be obtained for
Yugoslavia from Italy His Majesty's Government might be ready to make'
purchases for Yugoslavia in America. This proposal, involving as it would'
payment in dollars, would be equivalent to buying Yugoslav minerals required'
by the Allies in dollars. It is, however, to be remembered that if the Yugoslav
minerals are sent to Germany, it might in any case be necessary for H i s Majesty^
Government and the French Government to satisfy part of their own needs bv
purchases from difficult currency countries. "
