WAR CABINET.
ANGLO-ITALIAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS.
Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a Memorandum which has been prepared
in consultation with the Minister for Economic Warfare, who has agreed that
I should put it forward, in his absence, as our joint recommendations.
H.
December 4, 1939.
ON the 20th October the Minister for Economic Warfare presented to his
colleagues a proposal for dealing with the I t a l i an problem by setting up an Anglo-
Italian Joint Standing Committee to deal with commercial relations arising out
of our Contraband Control of German imports and commercial relations generally.
Since that date the Anglo-Italian Committee has been set u p and the Master
of the Rolls, has, I am glad to say, accepted Mr. Cross's invitation to become
chairman of the British delegation. Notwithstanding many difficulties, which
have led on the one hand to protests by the Italian Government at the delays
and inconvenience to which I t a l i a n ships have been subjected, and on the otnei
hand to modification of our system of control to meet local requirements m the
Mediterranean and to the particular position of Italy, our relations wrth that
country have on the whole improved. We have, in fact secured a greater measure
of co-operation than was to have been anticipated early in October.
In this connexion the policy of placing large orders m I t a ly for raw materials
and armaments was referred to at the meeting of the War Cabinet of the: 20th
October and again on the 13th November. I regret to say that, with one
exception, no armament contract has yet been concluded though a number o
other orders a r e under discussion. The consequence is tha t the P 1 0 P o s e ^ n ^
Clearing Agreement, which is a necessary part ot our commercial policy, i ^ a i n s
niKomludecl very largely because the I t a l i an authorities do not know ptec seh
how much we are going to spend in Italy and consequently what funds will be
l i a b l e for purchlses of coal and manufactured articles in the United Kingdom
10745 [20426]
and raw materials in the Empire. I regard it as of great importance that th'
Clearing Agreement should be rapidly concluded. It is obviously desirable that
the Italians should buy their raw materials within the Empire so that we will
retain control of their sources of supply. Moreover, in respect of goods bought
within the Empire, the Italian Government have declared their readiness"to
give guarantees against re-export.
Anglo-Italian economic relations have now been radically affected bv the
decision of His Majesty's Government involved in the Reprisals Order in Council
Italy has been taking about 7,000,000 tons of German coal, of which some
3,000,000 tons were sea-borne via Holland. I am advised that it would be
difficult, in the present state of the German railways, to carry the whole
7,000,000 tons to Italy by rail. If, in fact, the Italians cannot get their
7,000,000 tons, Italian economy will undergo a strain and perhaps suffer a breakdown
which would reflect itself in resentment and hostility to us. We must
therefore, be ready to step in and meet any deficiency. The Italians have already
asked us for 5,300.000 tons for 1940. W e may, therefore, have to supply them with
an additional 3,000,000 tons, which the Mines Department state it will be within
our capacity to do.
I am aware that the more the German railways are put under strain the
better, and I have, in fact, little doubt that the Italians will seek to increase their
rail-borne supplies from Germany, but the advantage of routing all Italian coal
ships to this country to fetch coal, instead of their going in part as at present
to Holland, will be of substantial benefit to us in our negotiation to secure the
use of Italian shipping.
The whole question of coal supplies is, however, intimately bound up with
the Clearing Agreement with Italy and with the extent of our disbursements in
that country.
The Foreign Office, Treasury and Ministry of Economic Warfare have
estimated, on the evidence produced by the Service and supply departments, that
the orders which we wish to place in Italy are likely to exceed &#163;20,000.000. The
figure for freights under the tentative schemes discussed with the Italians will
be not less than &#163;5,000,000 per annum.
It seems to us that there is only one way by which we can overcome the
difficulties which we are encountering in our negotiations for a clearing agreement
and at the same time make our proposals about coal acceptable to the Italians,
and that is to present to them a scheme to cover Anglo-Italian economic relations
as a whole. I think it will be necessary, therefore, instead of waiting for
individual contracts to be concluded, to give the Italians a suitable assurance
forthwith that a sum of not less than &#163;25,000,000 will be spent by us in Italy up
to the 31st December, 1940, on goods which we want and which we understand
that the Italians can supply, provided that the prices asked are reasonable. At
the same time we should inform the Italians of our ability to supply not less than
8,300,000 tons of coal at prices equivalent to those paid by domestic consumers.
&#163;25,000,000 should suffice to cover payment for the increased quantity of coal
required, for the payment of arrears on the clearing in due course, for payments
on special accounts, for the purchase of such manufactured United Kingdom
goods as we look like being able to supply, and still leave a surplus for the purchase
of raw materials in the Empire.
Italy, an agricultural country, normally sells fruits and vegetables on a large
scale to Germany against coal and manufactured goods. If we decrease German
coal exports, stopping the seaborne trade, Italian agricultural exports to Germany
will fall, which, of course, from our point of view, is highly desirable. But
the Italians will require an outlet for this produce, and it is to be feared that
they will seek to make us buy. It will be desirable to consider immediately what
steps can be taken to meet such a request.
The scheme outlined above provides a solution for the impasse which we
have reached in our clearing negotiations; it should enable us to bring into force
our embargo on German exports without risking Italian opposition; moreover,
we cannot supply coal unless immediate arrangements are made for it to he
paid for promptly through the clearing. Finally, such an arrangement Will
have the advantage of increasing our hold on the Italian market even alter
the war is over.
The Minister for Economic Warfare and I accordingly recommend t h a t : 
1 We stop I t a l i an imports of German seaborne coal as soon as we can supply
Italy with as much additional coal as is necessary.
2 We formally assure the Italian Government that we propose to spend
a minimum of &#163;25,000,000 in Italy up to the 31st December, 1940,
in the purchase of raw materials and manufactured goods and in
freight payments.
3. We seek to conclude our Clearing Agreement on that basis, on the understanding
that the necessary guarantees are forthcoming regarding the
use made of raw materials imported from the British Empire, and
that we continue to receive the co-operation which we have encountered
in our relations since the conclusion of the agreement to set up the
Joint Standing Committee.
