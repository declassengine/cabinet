No. 710 Secret,.
Prime Minister whom I saw this morning, absolutely
refuses to allow his Ministers to initial any agreement on
air training scheme until he has received from United Kingdom
Government satisfactory assurances on points (a) and (b) in
paragraph 11 of my telegram No, 650.
He takes view that these stipulations are reasonable
and could easily be given by United Kingdom Government.
Unless, however, it is possible for me to receive
notice by Monday morning at latest that His Majesty's
Government are prepared to agree forthwith to stipulations
as they stand in my telegram 650 I fear all hopes of initialling
memorandum of agreement must be abandoned with consequences
(as both Pairbairn and New Zealanders are leaving) of which you
are already aware.
I have discussed this with Riverdale and Balfour and
while we fully realise difficulties which His Majesty's
Government must naturally find in agreeing (as explained in
your earlier telegrams) we feel bound to urge most strongly
that they should accept these points as they stand in order to
avoid a complete breakdown.

No. 556 SECRET.
1. Your telegram No. 710 -if 25th November. Matter will
have to go to war Cabinet tomorrow morning for most urgent
consideration with a view to immediate message being sent from
Prime Minister to Mr. Mackenzie King.
2. Meanwhile, we want to be wuite clear as to what will
enable Canadian Prime Minister to allow his Ministers to initial
Agreement. You speak of "satisfactory assurances" on points
(a) and (b) in paragraph 11 of your telegram No. 650. Later,
you speak of your receiving notice that "His Majesty's Government
are prepared to agree forthwith to stipulations as they stand."
5. Will lie be satisfied with assurance that we understand
completely that the Agreement when initialled would not bind
Canadian Government (any more than United Kingdom Government)
unless and until (a) and (b) are disposed of to his satisfaction
as soon as may be thereafter.
4. Or is the position that Canada will not initial the
Agreement until we have as regards (a) actually given the
assurance he desires, and as regards (b) given an assurance that
the financial discussions will reach a mutually satisfying
result. The former presents difficulties enough. The latter
is clearly impossible seeing that in fact the discussions' cannot
even start effectively until Towers arrives.

5 . If answer t o (-3) i s a f f i r m a t i v e and you c a r e to l et

LI03T IMMEDIATE.
No. 713 Secret.
1
Your telegram No. 566.
we are satisfied that any undertaking of nature
suggested at paragraph 3 Of your telegram would entirely fail
to meet critical situation. Prime Minister's whole case is
that the Canadian Government's views as to preference of effort
are primarily for themselves to decide and should be accepted
by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in that spirit.
As regards over-all financial questions, he feels strongly
that too much has been asked of Canada and that matters have
already been allowed t o drag on far t o o long. He feels it
quite unnecessary at this stage to delay matter for visit of
Towers and feels that Canadians could well have been given
satisfactory treatment, if not earlier, at any rate in discussion
with Crerar whose telegrams on the subject, we gather,
have been far from reassuring.
2. Prime Minister is in a frank and quite uncompromising
mood and states that his Cabinet are united behind him. life
therefore see no hope whatever of shaking him.
3. We may add that the points (a) and (b) in paragraph
11 of my telegram No. 650 were drafted at the time in collaboration
with the officials delegated by the Prime Minister for
that very purpose, and were purposely drafted in more moderate
terms

terras than Canadians had originally proposed.
4. We therefore repeat that the Prime Minister requires
to receive, before initialling, (l) an assurance regarding
preference of effort in terms of (a) i n paragraph 11 of my
telegram No. 650, and ( 2 ) a written statement that any agreement
thus initialled is subject zo condition mentioned at (b) in
paragraph 11 of the same telegram.
5. V/e feel that the suggestion in paragraph 6 of your
telegram No. 566 would have the effect of confirming public
opinion here, which is already suspicious in its belief that a
rift exists between the delegations.
6. we must therefore press once more for full assurances
by the United Kingdom Government as indicated in paragraph 4
of the present telegram at the earliest possible moment. we
are fully agreed that these should, i f possible, be given in
direct personal message from the United Kingdom Prime Minister.
This to achive its object should reach Ottawa at the latest
by 10 a . B i . Canadian time, tommow Monday, Ends.

I have no hesitation in giving this assurance as I entirely
agree that it is Tor Canada to decide on the priority of her
effort and therefore I should not think of interfering in it
whatever our own opinions might be.
4. I should explain that we ourselves have attached the
highest priority to this Training Scheme, as indeed to our air
effort as a whole, which we believe may be a decisive factor
in the war. If the Canadian Government decided to contribute
to the Scheme on the scale contemplated, their polios'- will be
in the closest correspondence with our own. But we should not
have liked to emphasise the priority of the Air Training Scheme
lest it should have embarrassing effects on DUT relations with'
the French who ere pressing us strongly to increaee our effort
on land.
5. I hope that what I have said will remove any misapprehensions
which may exist as to the extent to w hi oh Canada would be
committed by the initialling of the Air Training Agreement before
the Australian and New Zealand delegates leave Ottawa. In the
circumstances I should like to appeal to you to agree to initial
the agreement with us so that we may now take this essential step
forward in our joint war effort.

(l) As a r-esult of a series of meetings today with other
Canadian Ministers and with myself;, the position now is that
the Prime Minister is satisfied, with the wording of the
message from the Prime Mini, ter of the United Kingdom to
the Canadian Government No. Ill on the financial issue
(point (b) of paragraph 11 of my 0650), Prime Minister is
still dissatisfied, with the situation regarding the
preference of effort.
(2) He also objected to being rushed, by decisions of
other Empire Delegations and said that he and his colleagues
must have time to consider the whole agreement with
deliberation which its importance required.
(3) As it was therefore impossible to initial the agreement
between all four parties before Pairbairn left this evening I
insisted that some step to prevent open appearance in the
Press of comment that Pairbairn's departure without any
result meant that the Imperial nature of the scheme had to be
dropped. Prime Minister therefore proposed, and other
delegates including the Australians and New Zealanders as a
last resort -accepted a Press release terms of which the
Prime Minister drafted, himself and which he is telegraphing
direct to Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

CYPRiiili TELEGRAM
CANADA
i the United Kingdom High Cpl^mls-iesipne.r in Canada,
d 27-th November., 1939. Received 4 . 5 3 a.in, on 20th Nov. 1939.
MOST IMMEDIATE.
No. 718.
(l) I fully realise the difficulty which it must
have caused the l/ar Cabinet to agree to the assurances given
in your telegram No. Ill to the Canadian Government. It is
therefore all the more disappointing to us all to have to
record that that telegram failed in its object of enabling
agreement to be initialled before Fairbairn left.
(2/ But the Prime Minister is in one of his most
uncompromising and at the same time changeable moods and it
has been impossible to predict from moment to moment
what form of wording would suit him. The wording
given in paragraph 2 of my telegram Iic 717 was however s
written at his dictation and in his presence by the Minister
?
of Air and he cannot now"depart from it.
(3) The position now is that (a) press statement is
being given out rank and file (b) Fairbairn has left, and will
write from New York tomorrow accepting the memorandum which
had been drawn up for initialling today, (c) BalfOur is
also leaving bringing copy of the memorandum with him
(d) Presumably Canadian Ministers who meet in the Cabinet
November 28th will go quietly ahead with study of the
memorandum and finally (e) we may hope for further progress
after receiving your views as to the Prime Minister's wishes
regarding preference of effort (see my telegram No. 717)
Riverdale will of course stay on.

Governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand
and Canada have completed their discussions with regard
to the Joint Air Training Scheme, They have worked out
?basis of agreement which is now being referred to their
respective Governments for decision".
