\'!L'R CABINET
INDIA AND THE WAR
Questions raised by Mr. Jinnan on behalf of the All-India
Moslem League.
Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.
The War Cabinet will remember that at the
beginning of November the Viceroy resumed the discussions
he had previously held with Mr. Gandhi and the Congress
President on the one hand and Mr. Jinnah, as representing
the All-India Moslem League, on the other in an endeavour
to secure some agreement between therri as the basis for an
approach to some form of co-operation with the Central
Government. This endeavour was infructuous, since the
Congress representatives declined to discuss any detailed
expedients for co-operation until their main demand for a
declaration of Indian independence had been conceded, AS
the result of these discussions Mr. Jinnah put on paper
certain points the elucidation of which he had been
instructed by the terms of the Moslem League's Resolution
issued with reference to the Viceroy's published statement
of 17th October to seek. I append a copy of his letter
dated 5th November.
The Viceroy and I have been discussing the terms
of the reply to be given to Mr. Jinnah, which the Viceroy
promised in an acknowledgment of his letter dated 6th
November, and I now submit for the approval of the War
Cabinet the draft of tho letter which I propose should be

sent in reply. The terms of the answers to the last three
questions have been agreed between myself and the Governor -
General. For the answer to the first point he would
prefer, though he does not appear to lay great stress on
his preference, the following:"
His Majesty1s Government1s declaration does not
exclude any part of the Constitution Act from the
reconsideration promised at the end of the war; and the
extent to which the whole or part of the scheme of the
Act then comes under revision will be determined only
by the wishes of the representatives of the various
interests to be taken into consultation with His
' Maj esty's Government."
His preference for this formula is based on the
suggestion that the shorter text contained in the
accompanying draft letter would apparently throw open to
reconsideration not merely the terms of the Act of 1935
but the whole policy and plans on which it is based,
including, e.g., Provincial Autonomy, Federation and
perhaps the whole policy of Dominion Status as India's
goal. My formula undoubtedly might have this effect, and
indeed it might well be read into the Governor-General's
own draft. But I cannot myself see any practical
advantage in the circumstances with which we are faced in
trying to draw a distinction between the terms of the Act
and the policy underlying it with the object of attempting
to safeguard ourselves from any commitment as to
reconsideration of the latter.
I have, however, gone some way towards meeting the
Viceroy's criticism by substituting "does not exclude
examination" for "does not exclude reconsideration" - the
phrase which was originally included in my reference to him.

I should add that the Secretary of State for the
Colonies has concurred in the terms of the answer
relating to Palestine.

;NDIA OFFICE.
18th December 1939

Letter from Mr. Jinnah to the Governor-General, dated
5th November, 1939.
I wish to thank you for giving me the interview on
the 4th of November as you had promised in your letter of
the 28th of October wherein you stated that you will be
glad at some suitable moment to endeavour further to
elucidate any points that there may be in doubt as
desired by the resolution of the Working Committee of
the All-India Muslim League of the 22nd of October.
In my interview with you on the 4th of November the
subject was fully discussed and now, as desired by Your
Excellency, I am herewith submitting to you the
following points for your consideration and early reply:1.
that so soon as circumstances may permit or
immediately after the War the entire problem
of India's future Constitution, apart from the
Government of India Act, 1935, shall be
examined and reconsidered de novo.
2. that no declaration shall, either in principle
or otherwise, be made or any Constitution be
enacted by His Majesty*s Government or the
Parliament without the approval and the
consent of the two Major Communities of India,
viz., the Musalmans and the Hindus.
3. that His Majesty's Government should try and
meet all reasonable National demands of the
Arabs in Palestine.
4. that the Indian troops will not be used outside
India against any Muslim Power or country.
I have already, in my interview, fully explained the
reasons and the grounds in support of these points over
and above of what is indicated in the statement of the

18th of September and the resolution of the 22nd of
October of the Working Committee of the All-India
Muslim League, copies of which have already been sent
to Your Excellency.
There is one more point which was mentioned in
the statement of the Working Committee of the 18th of
September, viz., the question of securing justice and
fairplay to the Musalmans in the Congress-governed
Provinces where even their elementary rights were being
ruthlessly trampled upon; but as the Congress
Ministries have gene out of office I do not desire to
say anything regarding this matter at present.

PROPOSED REPLY.
I am now in a position to reply to your letter of
5th November in which you submitted certain points for
my consideration. You will, I am sure, appreciate that
more than one of your questions, if considered in the
light of all the implications involved in it, would
raise issues affecting other communities in India and
that this correspondence between us would not be an
appropriate medium for making pronouncements on them.,
But I hope that my answers, limited though their scope
may be by this consideration, will none the less serve to
remove your difficulties.
My answer to your first question is that the
declaration I made with the approval of His Majesty"s
Government on 17th October last does not exclude
examination of any part either of the iict of 1935 or of
the policy and the plans on which it is based.
With reference to your second point, I can assure
you that His iwajesty's Government are not under any
misapprehension as to the importance of the contentment
of the Moslem community to the stability and success of
any constitutional developments in India. You need
therefore have no fear that the weight which your
community's position in India necessarily gives to their
views will be underrated.
As regards Palestine, His Majesty1s Government
have throughout done everything possible to meet the
reasonable demands of the Arabs and they continue to be
fully alive to the importance of that issue.
Finally you asked for an assurance that Indian
troops will not be used outside India against any Moslem

power or country. This question is fortunately
hypothetical, since His Majesty is not at war with any
Moslem Power. You will appreciate, however, that it is
impossible to give a guarantee jn terms so wide as those
of your letter which would have the effect of limiting
India's right to use its own army in its own defence
in circumstances which cannot now be foreseen; in the
present situation, however, as you are aware, every
precaution has been taken by His Majesty's Government, .
at the instance of the Government of India, to ensure
that Moslem feeling in India on this matter is fully
respected.
