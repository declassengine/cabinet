FECAMP BROADCASTING- STATION.
TECHNICAL GROUNDS FOR CLOSING,
Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.
The necessity for closing the broadcasting station
at Fecamp arises from the following considerations:(
i) The station represents a powerft.il long-range radio
beacon which can be used by enemy aircraft for
navigational purposes, thus off-setting the
measures taken by the British and French Governments
to prevent wireless transmission from their
territories from being used "by the enemy
(ii) The effect of the continued operation of this station
will be to alienate public opinion against the
measures taken by the British and French Governments
to enable a restricted system of broadcasting
to continue with safety in time of war.
2. German aircraft are equipped with apparatus for
direction finding on ground wireless stations which can
receive the radiations from Fecamp at distances of 200 miles
over land and hOO miles over sea. Using such a station as
Fecamp the limit of range of good direction finding by
aircraft equipped with loop aerials is of the order of 150
to 200 miles over land and 250 to 300 miles over sea. The
Air Ministry have carried out tests in obtaining bearings oi
Fecamp using aircraft direction finding apparatus in the
region of Plymouth at a distance of 200 miles from the
/station.

station. The results obtained were excellent and gave
errors not exceeding one degree. In this connection it must
be emphasised that a wireless station which may be regarded
as of low power from the point of view of broadcasting
technique, is a high power station in relation to radio
beacon work.
3 . The ranges given in paragraph 2 are for day
conditions and are greatly reduced at night. The ranges
are then of the order of 60 miles over land and 120 miles
over sea. On the other hand, it is known that the Germans
have been experimenting for several years with a view to the
perfection of apparatus which will give the same results by
night as by day. We do not know yet what success they have
achieved.
h. On the assumption that normal direction finding
apparatus only is available, it will be seen from the data
given above that German aircraft could use Fecamp in carrying
out attacks by day on objectives in Southern England, on the
3ritish Forces in Northern France and on ports of disembarkation"
used by the British Forces. At night, the enemy
aircraft would be aided in attacks on Channel ports and
shipping and in accurate mine laying in selected areas.
5 . The argument has been put forward that provided
Fecamp is closed down during air attacks no guidance will be
given to the enemy. But in attack on Channel ports,
aircraft flying in cloud over the Channel can fix their
Position with accuracy before they come within range of the
observation system. Flying from this known position they
can reach the neighbourhood of their objective by continuing
t o
fly in cloud by dead reckoning. In this way it is
/possible

possible for the enemy to avoid interception and obtain
guidance right up to the moment when he arrives in the
vicinity of the objective. At this stage it is too late to
close down Fecamp since the enemy will already have made
effective use of its signals to guide them (for example) to
Portsmouth, Southampton or Havre.
6. Further, for the purpose of attacking shipping in
the Channel, enemy reconnaissance aircraft can fix and report
their positions by the use of this station, and by the same
means, enemy bombers can navigate with accuracy to the
position of the convoy the reconnaissance aircraft are
shadowing. The observation systems on both sides of the
Channel will probably have no precise knowledge of the
presence of these aircraft and thus it will be impossible to
close down Fecamp in time to prevent its use by the enemy.
The station, therefore, allows the enemy to use bad weather
and visibility conditions to their advantage when otherwise
their operations would be so badly hampered as to be of little
value.
7- Again, enemy aircraft may attack British Forces in
Northern France by crossing Belgium, and here again the use
of Fecamp will help the enemy navigator to fix his position
before the aircraft enters France. The enemy aircraft can
thus evade our defences by flying in clouds until in the
vicinity of their objective, and can then emerge from the
clouds sufficiently close to make their attack and then again
evade the defences by entering the clouds. The closing of
Fecamp, once the enemy has crossed the frontier, would be too
late, in this part of France, to be effective. For these
reasons we have pressed the French Government to synchronise
/their

h.
their Northern stations and to close down Lille hut these
measures will he of little value as long as Fecamp continues
to- transmit.
8. The measures taken by the British and French
Governments to maintain broadcasting without affording
facilities for air navigation to the enemy have caused
considerable complaints from the public because of the
deterioration in broadcast services which must necessarily
result from the synchronisation system. By the use of such
a system, however, it is possible to ensure that the stations
are not closed too late during periods of enemy attack on
land targets and that they are of no assistance to enemy
aircraft making attacks on convoys or in mine laying. The
continuation of transmissions from such a station as Fecamp
is likely to result in the Government being pressed to
abandon synchronised broadcasting since the case for synchronisation
loses much of its point If unsynchronised
stations in the essential area continue to transmit and
provide the public with alternative programmes. If synchronisation
were abandoned the enemy would be given valuable
assistance in attacking our convoys at sea and our towns and
ports, and much of the value of the blaJbk-out measures taken
by the British and French Governments would be destroyed.
9. It is true that unsynchronised broadcasts from
neutral stations are not subject to our control, but none
the less Fecamp is a particular danger on account of its
geographical position adjacent to the Channel and land
objectives. It is certain that an enemy aircraft would
receive from Fecamp more effective guidance in attacking,
e'g. disembarkation ports, than it would from Belgian or
Dutch stations.

10. It should be explained that although the French
Government has synchronised certain of their Northern stations
and are preparing to form others, into synchronised groups,
there are still a number of French stations working
independently. So far as British interests are concerned,
however, the only station of importance in this category,
apart from Fecamp, is Lille. The French authorities are
being pressed to close Lille, but it is difficult to exert
adequate pressure, so long as a British sponsored station is
left transmitting which can cover so large an area of
Northern France and Southern England. The remaining
independent stations in the South and West of France do not
affect British interests in any way and are purely the
concern of the French Government, The French Government
a r e , however, fully conscious of the necessity for forming
these stations into synchronised groups and have prepared
suitable schemes for this purpose. When these schemes have
been implemented the isolated transmitting stations will be
eliminated except in so far as the French authorities may
decide that the continued transmission of an isolated station
is of such importance as to warrant the risk incurred.
11 . To summarise, it is desired to close Fecamp for
the following reasons:(
i) It acts as a beacon by day covering Southern
England, the Channel and Northern France,
(ii) It acts as a beacon by night which will guide enemy
aircraft to the coasts of Southern England and
Northern France,
(iii) The station can be used to assist in attacks on
convoys in the Channel as well as in accurate
mine-laying by aircraft at night.

(iv) Owing to its geographical position and the fact
that its range extends into Belgium, Fecamp cannot
he closed in time to prevent its being used by the
enemy.
(v) Its continued transmission will cause pressure to
be brought on the British and French Governments
to abandon the synchronised broadcasting system,
thereby giving a great advantage to the enemy and
nullifying to a great extent the measures taken to
conceal vulnerable areas at night,
(vi) Fecamp gives bettor direction- finding facilities to
German aircraft than is possible from neutral
stations-.
