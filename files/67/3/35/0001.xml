REPORT OF THE MINISTERIAh COMivlITT: .E ON
LIGHTING" RESTRICTIONS.
I. INTRODUCTORY.
The War Cabinet will recall that on 21st October,
1939, they approved certain recommendations which we
submitted to them in our first report (paper No, W.P/(G)(39)
44) and authorised us to remain in being as a Committee
and to report to them further on the matter in a few weeks5
time, (W. M.(39) 55th Conclusions, Minute 12 (ii)). In
accordance with this decision we have recently carried out
a further review of the system of lighting restrictions
and have considered in particular a memorandum circulated
by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper No, W. P. (G)(39)110).
In this connection we have also had before us a Joint
Memorandum prepared by the Air Staff and Air Raid
Precautions Department (Paper Noc C.L.R.(39) 7). As a
result of our examination of the question we have been able
to approve certain relaxations of the present system subject
to the safeguards considered essential by the Air Staff, We
now submit for the information of the War Cabinet a
statement of the steps which we have authorised in this
direction.
2. We recognise that any modifications in the
restrictions however desirable on general grounds must be
carefully scrutinised in order that the purpose for which
the system as a whole has beer, imposed may not be jeopardised.
The conditions proposed by the Air Staff as being
those which any suggested relaxation should fulfil were
as follows:(
a) That no concession should be made East of a line
drawi- 50 miles West from the East Coast. London
would therefore have to remain under all its
present restrictions,

(b)That all exempted lights must he able to be extinguished
within five minutes.
(c)That all exempted lights must be controlled by some
responsible authority.
(d)That concessions should be limited to external
lighting in undertakings of national importance,
such as railways, docks and building work on
important structures, etc. It is imperative that
work on the obscuration of light in factories should
not be retarded and that no concessions should be
afforded in this respect. Nor should concessions
be allowed as regards domestic or industrial lighting
having no national importance.
(e)That lighting of the permitted degree must be capable
of being restored to the present standard in one day
or else be of such a nature that it can remain
extinguished until such time as it has been so
restored.
(f)That in cases of doubt as to the enemy's intentions,
during such time as the greater degree of lighting
is permitted before enemy bomber operations start,
Red Warnings which are issued might have to be
extended to v/ider areas until such time as the
restricted lighting is restored.
After careful consideration v/e have accepted these
safeguards subject to the following qualifications:(
i)Special consideration should be given to the position
of the London area, although this forms part of the
zone lying within 5 0 miles of the East Coast prescribed
in sub-paragraph (a).
(ii)Lighting in excess of the present maximum should be
permitted wherever possible for external work of
national importance in areas outside the proposed
East Coast zone.
(iii)The issue of additional Red warnings in accordance
with sub-paragraph (f) should be restricted as far
as possible.
II. RELAXATION OF RESTRICTIONS AFFECTING PRODUCTION
AND TRANSPORT.
3. Within the limits indicated in the preceeding paragraph
it should, in our opinion, be possible to effect some
considerable further improvement in the present position.
The repercussions of the blackout on production and transport
are of the first importance. Here the action needed falls

2-65
into two parts. In the first place there is at the
present time a marked absence of uniformity in the amount
of light employed in vital centres for the production and
handling of goods, such as factories, shipyards, docks
harbours and on the railways. This is due to the fact
that the controlling authorities have frequently failed
to take full advantage of the standards of lighting
permitted to them. 17e understand that where as at Liverpool
the lighting employed is fully up to the standard permitted,
work proceeds without serious hindrance, throughout the
twenty-four hours. Failure to use as much light as is
permitted has been due to local feeling which is particularly
sensitive in areas subjected to air bombardment in the last
war. Something will have been done, therefore, to ease
the present position if steps can be taken to secure that
in all cases use is made of the full amount of light at
present permitted under the regulations. In the area
lying within 5 0 miles of the Hast Coast which is particularly
vulnerable to air attack it will not be possible to go further
than this, though as indicated, in paragraph 2 above special
consideration should be given to the position of London in
view of its importance as a centre of national production.
Over a large part of the country however in areas lying
outside the East Coast zone, steps should also be taken to
grant further exemptions to undertakings engaged on work of
national importance, and to allow, wherever desirable in
the national interest, the present permitted maximum for
external lighting to be exceeded,
4 , In order that action in both these directions may be
taken with the minimum of delay, we have arranged for a
small central co-ordinating committee to be set up
armed with the necessary executive powers. This committee

will be composed, of representatives of the following
departments: -
Ministry of Home Security,
Air Ministry,
Ministry of Transport,
Ministry of Supply,
Ministry of Shipping,
It will also include a Trade Union representative. It will
not itself conduct a detailed survey of the areas concerned,
but will work as a rule through its technical officers, who
will follow the general lines laid down by the committee and
will only refer to them difficult cases involving questions
of principle.
III. RELAXATION OF RESTRICTIONS AFFECTING PUBLIC MORALE
AND ROAD SAFETY.
5 . The task of the committee proposed above will be to
mitigate the more serious effects of the blackout in slowing
down essential operations in the field of production and
transport. The effect however of the restrictions on
public morale and road safety are also of great importance.
Here there are a number of directions in which progress can
be made by relaxing the restrictions in the general sense of
the proposals contained in paragraph 3 of the memorandum by
the First Lord of the Admiralty to which we have already
referred. These are set out below.
(a) Street lighting.
6. We are still unable to recommend any radical departure
from the"present regulations for street lighting such as
would permit of some form of modified lighting being used
provided that it was extinguished on receipt of a yellow
warning. The technical difficulties in the way of this
course and the objections to destroying the confidential
character of the yellow warning still seem to us conclusive. -
We hope however that some improvement may be made by the use
of a form of diffused ligHting of low intensity which could

be left on during ah air raid. Experiments similar to
those discussed in paragraph 23 of our first report (Paper
No. V7.P. (G) ( 3 9 ) 44) have since been continued, though the
necessary aerial observation has been interrupted at times
by unsuitable weather conditions. On the assumption that
the results of air observation are satisfactory, we have
approved the introduction of a system of street lighting
of low intensity making use of the existing lighting
standards (whether gas or electric) by attaching to them a
simple device. These arrangements give sufficient light
to' reduce the discomfort and risks of pedestrians? while
not interfering with the generally dark background against;
which vehicle lighting has been designed.
(b) Lighting of trains and vehicles.
7. As reported in paragraph 9 of our first report (W.P.(G)
( 3 9 ) 44) a satisfactors-- system of lighting for express trains
has been devised and is being introduced as rapidly as
possible. An improved form of lighting is also being installed
by the London Passenger Transport Board, on buses,
tramcars and: those underground trains which on certain
sections of their route run above ground. This lightingis
strong enough to enable passengers to read but is screened
in such a way as not to throw any light upon the ground
outside. It will add much to the comfort of passengers.
Lighting of this type should moreover provide a solution
for the difficulties of lighting suburban trains to which
we referred in paragraph 1.0 of our first report (W.P.(G)
( 3 9 ) 44) ana She railway companies are being advised to
adopt it for this purpose. The improvements set out above
are being introduced as rapidly as possible? and we have
invited the Minister of Transport to keep a constant watch
on the position in order that there may be no delay.
8. The position in regard to the driving lights carried by

motor vehicles is in our opinion satisfactory- Excellent
results have heen obtained with the new mask for headlights
which gives a satisfactory light on both sides of the car
while avoiding dazzle, Within a few weekn production will
have reached a level which will enable the use of the mask
to be made compulsory,
(c) "-Lighting of shop windows.
9. An inexpensive and effective form of lighting has now
been devised for the lighting of shop windows and the
approved specification will be issued within the next few
days- The device used for screening the light is of simple
construction and there should be no difficulty in securing
supplies of the necessary materials,, This form of lighting
will be permitted been in town and country districts and will
be employed experimentally for the Christmas period during
which it should be of considerable assistance to Christmas
trade If found satisfactory its use will be extended for
an indefinite period,
(d) Ejiforcement of the restrictions.
1 0 . We have given consideration to the manner in which the
lighting restrictions are at present being enforced, and
to instances in which it has been alleged that prosecutions
have been instituted for trivial breaches of the regulations.
We find that many of bhe accounts which have appeared in the
Press on this subject are exaggerated and incomplete. The
Home Fecretary informs us that he has recently instructed all
Chief Officers of Police in England and Vales to prosecute
only for repeated and wilful offences against the regulations.
In Scotland there appears to have been seme disparity in the
sentences passed and the Secretary of State for Scotland in
consultation with the Lord Advocate has had under consideration

the possibility of using the prerogative for suspending
certain sentences which appear excessive and also the
question of prosecutions generally. At our request the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland
have undertaken to consider the issue of a circular to
Chief Officers of Police designed to secure for the future
greater uniformity and the absence of undue rigour in the
enforcement of the restrictions.
1 1 . We consider that the modifications of the
restrictions that have been or are being introduced on
the lines described above will go far to remove some of
the principal handicaps and inconveniences at present
caused by the black out. Our general conclusion is that
we should maintain the broad lines of our present policy
while introducing all mitigations of the position which
are reasonable and practicable. It is most important
however that any modifications which may be made
in the lighting arrangements for places which would
provide targets for attack, such as docks, harbours,
factories, etc, should be carried out by administrative
action and without any publicity which might be of
assistance to the enemy. On the other hand this does
not imply that no public announcement should be made
regarding such matters as the introduction of lighting
for shop windows, where on strategic grounds there is
no necessity for secrecy.

IV. SUMMARY OF COMCLUSIONS.
12. The following is a summary of the coneTusions which
we have reached as a result of the further survey which we
have carried out of the system of lighting restrictions:(
a) We have approved generally some relaxation of
the lighting restrictions on the conditions
laid down hy the Air Staff set out in paragraph
2 above, subject to certain modifications which
we have also indicated in that paragraph;
(b) We have invited the Home Secretary, the
Secretary of "itate for ^lir, the Minister of
Transport, the Minister of Supply and the
Minister of Shipping to constitute a small
central co-ordinating committee, including a
representative of each of the. five departments
concerned together with Trade Union representation
and have agreed that it should be the duty of
this committee to review the standards of
exte3?nal lighting at present in use in docks,
harbours, factories, shipyards and on the
railways, and in any other instances where full
advantage is not being taken of the standards
of external lighting at present permitted; and
to arrange as soon as possible for their
technical officers to visit the principal
centres for the purpose of:(
i) affording the necessary information and
advice regarding the standards of lighting
permitted and the best means of complying
with them;
(ii) granting in selected cases permission to
exceed the prescribed standards, where
this appears desirable in the national
interest and within the limits laid down
by the ,dr Staff as approved by us; the
technical officers of the co-ordinating
committee to be given full power to act
subject to reference to that committee
on difficult questions of principle that
may arise.
(c) Subject to a favourable outcome of the
experiments at present in progress at liendon,
we have approved, generally the adoption of a
modified form of street lighting on lines which
have been worked out by the Air Raid precautions
Department in consultation with the Air Staff;

(d) We have invited the Minister of Transport to
keep a constant watch on the position regarding
the driving lights carried by motor vehicles
and the internal lighting of buses, tramcars
and railway trains, in all of which considerable
improvements have been and are being effected;
(e) We have approved- the proposal of the Home
Secretary to authorise the introduction of a
modified form of lighting for use in shop
windows;
(f) We have invited the Home Secretary and the
Secretary of State for Scotland to consider the
issue of a circular to Chief Officers of Police
designed to secure greater uniformity and the
absence of any undue rigour in the enforcement
of the lighting restrictions;
(g) Subject to the relaxations indicated in (a) and
(b) above, we consider that the existing
lighting restrictions should remain in force;
(h) We are of the opinion that any modifications
of the restrictions to be introduced in
accordance with (a) above affecting the lighting
of places such as docks, harbours, factories,
etc. which might provide targets for enemy
attack, should be carried, out by administrative
action and without publicity of any kind; but
that this should not exclude the making of
public announcements from time to time in regard
to such matters as the introduction of light
in shop windows where on strategic grounds there
is no necessity for secrecy.
