WAR CABINET.
UNEHiPLOYT 1FNT ASSISTANCE BOARD,
PROPOSED INCREASE IN SCALES OP PAYMENT.
Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.
1. At the tenth meeting of the Ministerial Committee of the
War Cabinet on Economic Policy, it was agreed (E.P.(M)(39)
10th Mtg.) that the pr:posals for increases in the scales
of payment about to be submitted to the Government by the
Unemployment Assistance B"-ard were reasonable and should
he accepted. Those proposals were, in brief, that there
should be an increase of one shilling in the weekly rate
for each person of trie age of 16 or over and of sixpence
in the rate for each person under sixteen. These increases
are equivalent to a rise of about 10$ on current rates.
2. I desire now to state for the information of the Cabinet,
that proposals on these lines have now been received from
the Unemployment Assistance Board. I am anxious that payments
at the new rate should be made before Christmas and in order
to enable this to be done, I propose to make Draft Regulations
at once and to lay them before each House of Parliament in
accordance with the provisions of Section 52(3) of the
Unemployment Act, 1934, The Draft Regulations will require
an affirmative resolution by each House before Operative
Regulations are made. The date of operation will be Monday
18th December.

3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his speech in the
House of Commons on the 29th November, indicated that an
increase of Unemployment Allowances was under the
consideration of the Unemployment Assistance Board and
that these allowances were in a class apart from other
Social Services. In these circumstances he informs
me that he has no objection to my proposal.
