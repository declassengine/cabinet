Ql\ HOME FOOD PRODUCTION POLICY
1 . It may perhaps he desirable to re-state the general
principles on which the Government!s food production policy
is based, and what I am going to say applies to the United'
Kingdom as a whole. It is essential to make the most
efficient and economical use of all our resources,
finance, shipping, industry and land, and to develop
them to the fullest possible capacity. Much was done in
the years preceding the war under the Wheat Act, the Land
Drainage Act, the Livestock and Sugar Beet Acts and the
Land Fertility Scheme, to assist agricultural production
and improve the fertility of the land, within the economic
possibilities of pre-war peace time conditions. But the
productive capacity of our land, of course, can be greatly
increased. The more we can produce from it the more
foreign exchange and shipping we can save for the purchase
and import of the raw materials and munitions which we
require for our war effort.
2 . Our arable land has as high an average yield per acre
as at any previous period. Our best pastures provide as
large quantities of food per acre for cattle and sheep as
ever they did. What we must now do is to plough, and
especially we must plough up as much as possible of the
millions of acres of second and third rate pastures which
today are yielding only a fraction of what they once
yielded in human food and feedingstuffs for animals.
There was a time when land of this kind not only produced
large quantities of wheat, but also provided the whole of
%he food requirements for a large population of sheep and cattle.

Indeed the most remarkable feature of the decline in the
productivity of our land over the last half century has
been the decline in the production of feedingstuffs for
livestock. It is unnecessary to discuss the economic
circumstances which have led to this decline in productivity
and to an increasing reliance on imported feedingstuffs.
It is obvious that today we cannot allow so large an acreage
to continue merely to produce poor grazing and hay. It
must be made to produce crops or good and nutritious grass.
3, Our plan is to secure the ploughing-up of at least
1,500,000 acres in England and Wales and 2,000,000 acres in
the United Kingdom as a whole before next summer. The
Government attach the greatest importance to the fulfilment
of this programme. We want to grow more wheat on land
which it suitable for wheat and is likely to produce a
satisfactory wheat crop, and we want a substantial increase
in the acreage under potatoes; but we can also save
shipping by reducing as far as possible our dependence upon
imported animal feedingstuffs, of which we imported
7,500,000 tons last year, by growing more oats, barley,
beans, peas and fodder crops or re-seeding so as to produce
more and better grass. The policy of the Government is,
therefore, to allow as much latitude as possible in cropping,
but farmers who are primarily concerned with the production
of milk or livestock should in their own interests and in
the national interest prepare to make their land yield as
much of the food requirements of their stock as possible.
4. A ploughing-up campaign of this magnitude requires of
course a great effort on the part of farmers and workers
and they must be assured of a fair return for what they
are called upon to do. The producer's job is to produce

and the Government will see that conditions are created in
which he is able to deliver the goods. The Government
recognises that if the desired increase in home production
is to be secured, a higher level of prices will be necessary
for agricultural products generally. We must avoid
extravagant or uncontrolled increases in prices such as
those which occurred in the last war and led eventually to
disaster for agriculture. But given a level of prices
which will provide a reasonable return to farmers and will
enable them to pay a fair wage to the workers, we can, I
believe - if the weather permits - get the 8,000,000 acres
ploughed up and relieve the strain on our shipping by
saving a very large tonnage of imports of food and
feedingstuffs.
5 . As regards wages, the difficulties created by the
present level of agricultural wages in relation to wages in
other industries or occupations are generally recognised.
It has also been represented to me by the workers' unions
that the present arrangements for regulating agricultural
wages are unsatisfactory and lead to many anomalies.
Discussions are now proceeding between farmers and the
workers' representatives about the machinery for fixing
wages, and I would express the confident hope that there
will be a satisfactory outcome of these deliberations.
I would say again in this connection that the Government
for their part recognise that in fixing agricultural
prices regard must be paid to the need for a reasonable
wage to the worker.
6. There is another matter which is of as much importance

6. There is another matter which is of as much importance
to the farmer and worker as the level of prices in the immediate
future. Our policy for increasing the productivity of the land
must he one which farmers can follow with confidence. To do
what the Government asks and the national needs require, farmers
will in many cases have to change their farming system and in
any case will have to plan for several years ahead. The
industry - both farmers and workers - is entitled to expect a
reasonable measure of security. In framing and developing our
policy for war-time production, the Government are determined
to avoid creating a situation which wo\ild lead to the disasters
which followed the last war. That is why we are in favour of
a moderate and controlled increase and not an exaggerated
increase in prices of livestock ana crops. That is why we are
encouraging the utmost latitude and flexibility in cropping the
newly-ploughed land. That is why we are urging farmers to
make themselves more self-sufficient in feedingstuffs for their
livestock and not to concentrate solely on expanding production
of corn and potatoes. 3y this policy we believe that we can
keep agriculture on a properly balanced system as well
as securing the maximum increase in productivity and the
maximum saving of shipping. The Government also believes
that by this policy we can ensure that the transition from
war-'c ime to peace-time conditions can be effected with full
regard to the necessity for avoiding sudden and drastic
changes in agricultural policy.
There are certain further steps which the
Government propose to take to assist the fulfilment of the
food production campaign.
I have referred to the need to prevent the drift
of workers from the land. Further consideration is also
being given to the problem of" reconciling claims on
manpower for the purpose of food production with claims on

man power for the Fighting Services.
The Government propose to extenc the present
arrangements under which the County War Executive Committees
can help those farmers who are unable to finance the
ploughing-up and cultivation of land required of them under
Compulsory Orders, by undertaking the work and recovering
the cost.
The Government propose to take further steps to secure
the better drainage of land which Is potentially fertile
but is at present waterlogged, and to enable County
Committees to undertake or finance, on a more general scale
than hitherto, the cultivation of areas of derelict or semi-,
derelict land which are to be found in many counties. I
hope to be able to make more detailed announcements on
these subjects at an early date.'
Finally I would say that when all concerned have done
their utmost and, as we hope, we have got the 2,000,000
acres ploughed-up before next spring - and more if we can we
shall then if the war continues have to prepare for 'a
further ploughing-up campaign for the following year.
In order to enable County Committees and farmers to make
their plans ahead, I think It desirable to state now that
the Government contemplate that in that event the grant
of &#163;2 an acre for the ploughing-up of seven-year-old
grassland should be continued for another year beyond the
31st March, next.
