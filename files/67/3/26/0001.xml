PEFUGEES IN TH3 UNITED KINGDOM.
Report by the Committee on the Refugee Problem-.
r
V.e attach, for the early consideration of the War
Cabinet, a Memorandum by the Home Secretary on the pressing
question of the Refugees in the United Kingdom;, and in
particular of those refugees who are being wholly maintained
by the voluntary Organisations.
2. It will be observed that there are in all some
50,000 refugees in this country of whom about 13,300 are
being maintained at the cost of the Central Organisations,
rhe Jewish Committee, which is responsible for 85-90 per
cent of the refugees have now informed the Home Office that
they are at the end of their financial resources and cannot,
therefore continue their financial responsibilities to the ^
refugees. The other Committees are in a similar position.
It is clear that when the Central Organisations guaranteed
to maintain the refugees until they could be emigrated they
took far too optimistic a view of the situation. They appear
to have proceeded on the assumption that if war did not break
out they would be able to maintain the refugees by voluntary
subscriptions, and that if war did break out many of the
refugees would obtain regular employment or would be interned.
3. The position has been carefully reviewed by.a
Conference of Representatives of all the Departments
concerned who have reached the conclusion, with which we
agree, that it would, for various reasons, be impracticable
to allow the 13,000 refugees to come on to Public Assistance.
For example the greater part of the burden would fall on a
few local authorities; and the local authorities would, have
a strong case for saying that such a burden should, be borne
nationally rather than locally. Moreover, if the voluntary
organisations abandon their effort, subscriptions will dry
up and. there will be no longer any opportunity of obtaining
even part of the money from voluntary sources.
k. v/e also agree, that, as clearly these refugees cannot
be allowed to starve, the best practicable solution is one
on the lines of the scheme on page 3 of the Home Secretary's
Memorandum. Briefly this scheme contemplates that for a
period of six months from 1 s t January, 191+0, the Iljjphequer
should contribute towards the maintenance of those refugees
who are wholly maintained by the voluntary organisations an
amount equivalent to 8/- per head per week. This contribution
will be conditional on the voluntary organisations
undertaking that such persons shall not come on public
assistance and that they will expect no assistance in
respect of those partially maintained. It is necessary
that any Exchequer grant should, be on a -per ca-oita basis
because in the course of the six months the number of
persons to be maintained may fluctuate, and. it is estimated
that, when allowance is made for administrative expenses and
for some assistance to persons not wholly maintained, a grant

of 8/- for each person wholly maintained will provide about
50;a of the expenditure which can be- regarded as the minimum
necessary for the purpose. As regards refugees who have
"been in employment and have lost their jobs as a result of
the war, such, for example, as domestic servants, they
should come on unemployment assistance.
5 , As regards refugees who arc emigrated during this
period of six months, the Government to pay half the
approved expenses, An approved scale of charges in respect
of emigration to be settled by the Home Office.
6. In order "cc so arc ;he scheme and gi t ime t o the
Organisations to raise the additional money - voluntary
effort the Exchec uer is c o contribute forth 7 1 ;h a sum of at
least &#163;75,000.
7. The Minister of Labour fears that the proposal that
the Government should make a weekly contribution of 8/towards
the cost of maintaining each of the refugees in
cuestion would be represented as giving these alien refugees
more favourable treatment accorded to ordinary
destitute British subjects who must, in the last resort, get
relief from the Poor Law. For example, if this proposal
was adopted what answer could be given to some charitable
organisation which offered to maintain, say destitute widows,
if the Government would contribute 8/-- per head per week
towards their maintenance. The Minister of Labour hopes
that the Exchequer contribution will take the form of a lump
sum grant so as "co avoic raising emoarrassmg questions on
the point.
The other membe of the Committee doubt, however,
"whether questions of this kind, can "be avoided by expressing
the grant in aid as a lump sum rather than a per capita
payment. The only way in which it could be argued that the
alien refugee was being placed in a better position than a
destitute British subject was that he was avoiding the stigma
of the Poor Law. We think that there should, bo no difficulty
in defending the arrangement on the broad ground that the
case of these alien refugees is a special one which cannot
satisfactorily be covered by the Poor Lav; or other machinery
under wb provision is mace or ordinal ?v destitute British
subjects

which receives him.
10. " "e are informed by Lord kiriterton that in the view
of the United States authorities in Washington, if'the
South American Republics, and in particular the Argentine
and Brazil were willing to do so, they could absorb all the
Jewish refugees in question. Up to the present, however,

the South American Republics have been afraid of
facilitating the settlement of Jewish refugees because
of the reactions which this might produce on their barter
arrangements with Germany. In view of the fact that
these barter arrangements have now broken down as a
result of our blockade measures it may be that the South
American Republics will be more disposed to help in this
matter. We have invited the Foreign Office, in consultation
with the departments concerned to examine the question
whether, in the war trade agreements which we are now
making with the South American Republics, it would be
possible for us to stipulate that the entry of Jewish
Refugees into their territories could be facilitated.
11. If the War Cabinet decide to approve the scheme
for assisting the refugees we suggest that no specific
announcement on the subject should be made in Parliament
or otherwise, but that the matter should be treated as one
of ordinary administrative routine. If a formal announcement
becomes Unprwxt-able, the Ministry of Labour should join the
other departments concerned in the drafting of the statement,
so that as far as possible their difficulty referred to in
paragraph 7 above can be covered.
12. We recommend the War Cabinet:
(l) To accept, in principle, the scheme for
assisting alien refugees in the United
Kingdom set out on page k of Paper No.
C.R.P.(39) 1.8, attached to this"Report,
and to authorise the submission of this
scheme to the Jewish Committee and other
Committees with a view to obtaining their
acceptance of it.
(2) To take note that the Foreign Office, in
consultation with the other departments
concerned, have been invited to examine
the question of including in our war trade
agreements with the South American
Republics some stipulation about facilitating
the entry into their respective countries
of the Jewish Refugees in question.

REFUGEES IN THE TOUTED KIMH30M.
Memorandum by the Home Secretary.
The voluntary organisations which have h i t h e r t o been maintaining
the refugees have r e p r e s e n t e d to the Home Office that they are no
longer able t o r a i s e s u f f i c i e n t funds from c h a r i t a b l e sources, and that
u n l e s s the Government i s w i l l i n g t o g i v e f i n a n c i a l a s s i s t a n c e to the
o r g a n i s a t i o n s , i t w i l l be necessary for a l a r g e number of r e f u g e e s to
come on p u b l i c a s s i s t a n c e.
There are about 50,000 r e f u g e e s i n t h i s country excluding the
c h i l d r e n who have been brought i n under the Movement for the Care of
Children. So f a r as the c h i l d r e n are concerned no q u e s t i o n a r i s e s of
any Government a s s i s t a n c e . The q u e s t i o n of Government a s s i s t a n ce
r e l a t e s only t o the adult r e f u g e e s . Of these adult refugees some are
i n employment, some have funds of t h e i r own, and the great majority are
being maintained by i n d i v i d u a l s who have g i v e n to the Central
Organisation a guarantee t o maintain the refugee u n t i l such time as he
or she can be emigrated. In a few cases these i n d i v i d u a l sponsors are
finding themselves unable t o f u l f i l t h e i r guarantees, and the Central
Organisation thereupon becomes r e s p o n s i b l e for the refugee; but these
cases are comparatively few i n number.
The number of refugees who are being maintained at the c o s t of
the Central Organisations i s about 13,300; about 5,600 are r e c e i v i ng
weekly allowances; the remainder are i n h o s t e l s . Included i n t h is
f i g u r e are about 3,000 domestic servants who have l o s t t h e i r employment
s i n c e the beginning of the war.
Arrangements f o r emigration are s t i l l being made and i t is
estimated that by the end of June i t w i l l be p o s s i b l e to emigrate
6,000 persons to America and 150 t o A u s t r a l i a at a c o s t , say, of about
&#163;100,000. A l a r g e number of the people who are being emigrated,
however, are not those who are at present being maintained, and
t h e r e f o r e t h e i r emigration w i l l not reduce t o any considerable extent
the charge on the v o l u n t a r y o r g a n i s a t i o n s for maintenance.
The t o t a l sum being expended by the voluntary organisations on
maintenance, emigration and a d m i n i s t r a t i o n i s about &#163;15,000 per week.
Arrangements are being made t o allow a l i e n s to take employment
where they can do s o without detriment t o the i n t e r e s t s of B r i t i sh
workers. A number of r e f u g e e s are a l s o being e n l i s t e d i n t o pioneer
b a t t a l i o n s and other m i l i t a r y u n i t s . Some r e d u c t i o n i n the expenditure
on maintenance w i l l r e s u l t as the r e f u g e e s get i n t o employment or i n to
"the Army, but the number l i k e l y to be absorbed i n employment during the
next few months i s small.

The great majority of the refugees are Jews, and in 1933 an
undertaking was given to the Home Office by a committee representing
the Jewish Community that "all expenses whether in respect of temporary
or permanent accommodation or maintenance will be borne by the Jewish
Community without ultimate charge to the State". In 1938 when the
seizure of Austria took place, the Jewish Committee wrote to the Home
Office saying: "Whilst we recognise our liability with regard to
refugees who are already in this country, we cannot extend our
undertaking to refugees who arrive after this date ........ We feel that
under existing circumstances we cannot commit ourselves to an unlimited
liability. We would of course always be prepared to make an exception
for refugees whom the Home Office or the Ministry of Labour decide to
admit to this country after previous consultation with us". Since that
date very large numbers of refugees have been admitted and in almost
all cases after consultation with the Jewish Committee or with one of
the other voluntary organisations which are affiliated with the Central
Refugee Organisation,,
The Jewish Committee, which is responsible for 85 - 90 per cent
of the refugees, have now told the Home Office that they are unable to
continue to be responsible, because they are at the end of their
financial resources, and the other Committees are in a similar position.
Since 1933 it is calculated that approximately &#163;5,000,000 has been spent
by the voluntary organisations apart from private expenditure by
refugees1 relatives and friends, which is estimated at a further &#163;5,000,000,
There have been consultations between the Home Office and
representatives of the Jewish Committee, and it has been pointed out to
the representatives of the Jewish Committee that if public funds are used
for the maintenance of these refugees, such a change of policy will give
great strength to such anti-alien and anti-Jewish feeling as may be
latent in this country, The representatives of the Jewish Committee
recognise these difficulties, but they nevertheless say that it is quite
impossible for them to raise the funds required to enable them to
continue an expenditure of about &#163;15,000 a week.
There has been consultation between the Home Office, the Treasury,
the Ministry of Health and the Unemployment Assistance Board on the
question. The objections to allowing about 13,000 refugees to come on
public assistance are obvious. Apart from other difficulties the greater
part of the burden would fall on a few local authorities, and the local
authorities would have a strong case for saying that such a burden
should be borne nationally rather than locally., Moreover, if the
voluntary organisations abandon their effort, subscriptions will dry up
and there will be no longer any opportunity of obtaining even part of
the money from voluntary sources,
The question was discussed with the Jewish representatives whether,
if the Government were prepared to give a 50 per cent grant, they would
give an under talcing to find the other 50. They, however, felt they
were not in a position at the present time to give a promise since
"they did not know how.much they would raise. All- they would say was
that they would try to raise as much money as possible

I t i s clear t h a t i f a Government grant i s t o be made some lump sum
most be given t o the voluntary organisations to enable them t o carry on
for a short period during which they may hope t o r a i s e f u r t h e r additional
SUBS from c h a r i t a b l e sources. As regards, however, any f u t u r e arrangements,
i t seems necessary (a) t h a t any Government grant should be based on a
figure which i s not higher than the maintenance grants available for
B r i t i s h subjects under the Unemployment Assistance s c a l e s , and (b) that
any Government grant should be given on the condition t h a t the voluntary
organisations undertake t h a t the refugees s h a l l not come on public
assistance.
The scheme suggested at a reeent conference of Departmental
representatives i s as follows : -
Let i t be assumed t h a t i n respect of each refugee wholly maintained
by the voluntary o r g a n i s a t i o n s , the average expenditure including
administration i s 1 6 / - a week. Let the Government for a period of s ix
months from the 1st January contribute 8 / - a week i n r e s p e c t of refugees
who are shown t o be wholly maintained by the voluntary organisations,
provided the voluntary organisations undertake t h a t such persons s h a l l not
come on public a s s i s t a n c e and t h a t they w i l l expect no a s s i s t a n c e in
respect of those p a r t i a l l y 1 maintained. As regards refugees who have been
in employment and have l o s t t h e i r jobs as a r e s u l t of the war, such, for
example, as domestic s e r v a n t s , l e t them come on unemployment a s s i s t a n c e.
As regards refugees who are emigrated during t h i s period of s ix
months, the Government to pay half the approved expenses. An approved
scale of charges i n respecft of emigration t o be s e t t l e d by the Home Office *
Let i t be assumed t h a t i f t h i s scheme had been i n operation for three
months before the 1st January next the Government c o n t r i b u t i o n would have
been, say, about &#163;75,000, and l e t a lump sum of &#163;75,000 be paid to the
voluntary organisations so' t h a t they may have some money i n hand and be
able t o carry on for a s h o r t time while they are r a i s i n g a d d i t i o n a l funds.
Probably the organisations w i l l ask for a l a r g e r lump sum, and i t may be
necessary t o r a i s e the proposed amount of &#163;75,000.
I t i s not known whether the Jewish community w i l l accept a scheme
on these l i n e s or whether they w i l l say i t i s impossible for them to
give a guarantee even for s i x months t h a t they w i l l find t h e i r 50 per cent
of the expenditure, but i f approval i s given t o these proposals by the
Home S e c r e t a r y and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, i t i s proposed at once
to t r y t o secure the consent of the Jewish Committee and other committees
to a scheme on these l i n e s . It would be p a r t of the scheme t h a t a
corporate body should be formed representing a l l the v o l u n t a r y organisations,
wnich would give a guarantee that i n c o n s i d e r a t i o n of the Government grant
the refugees s h a l l not be allowed to f a l l on public a s s i s t a n c e.
