DIVERSION OF SHIPPING: INCREASED USE OF
WEST COAST PORTS.
Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.
Following a discussion in the War Cabinet on October
1(59) 47^ 14th and subsequent correspondence with the First Lord of
Illusions,
lite 6). the Admiralty, I asked the Port and Transit Organisation to
report on the possibilities of arranging for the discharge of
overseas vessels should they be unable to find accommodation
in ports and the practicability of increasing the user of
coasting ships and barges. The Report has received the
approval of the Advisory Committee of the Organisation, which
is composed of representatives of all the Departments
interested in ships and their cargoes together with
representatives of trading, transport and labour interests
including Mr. A.V. Alexander and Mr. Ernest Bevin.
2. I do not ask the War Cabinet to examine this very
thorough and comprehensive Report in detail. It is well
summarised in paragraph 77.
3. In paragraphs 3 - 2 1 the history, and certain
criticisms, of diversion policy to west coast ports are
discussed, and the Organisation now asks for authority to
follow a policy of allowing all ports to continue to function
to the maximum of their capacity until prevented from doing
so by enemy action, by congestion or by supply conditions,
subject to the provisos that (
1) a vessel should normally be diverted to a
port on the west coast if its cargo for an
east coast port is small and if it will load
outwards from the west coast; and

PORT AND TRANSIT ORGANISATION.
To the Minister of Transport.
DIVERSION OF SHIPPING.
' ON the 18th October, 1939, we were directed as follows :
" The Minister of Transport directs that, with a view to securing and
prolonging the maximum amount of diversion of ocean-going shipping from
the East to the West Coast, and having regard to supply conditions, the Port
and Transit Organisation shall examine and report upon the following
matters :
(1) the facilities on the West Coast for discharging overside into
(a) coasting ships, and (b) barges, from large ships for which
wharfage accommodation may not be available in western ports;
(2) the facilities offered by the smaller ports for the reception, handling
and despatch inland of cargoes carried coastwise;
(3) the practicability of increasing the user of (a) coasting ships, and
(&amp;) barges, and thus relieving the burden on inland transport;
(4) the practicability of filling up empty refrigerated space in London by
rail from the West Coast.
For the purpose of this report the East Coast may be assumed to be
Tyhe to Southampton (both inclusive)."
In pursuance of that direction, we submit below our observations and report;
there is a Summary in paragraph 77.
'2. Before discussing the terms of reference in detail, we wish to put before
you certain views on diversion of shipping generally as a result of our experience
since the beginning of September 1939; we wish to call special attention to the
analysis of these views in paragraphs 17-21.
History.
3. The vessels with which we have been primarily concerned are British
vessels exceeding 1,600 tons gross approaching United Kingdom ports from the
South and West; thus we have not been actively concerned with coasting vessels
or vessels approaching the United Kingdom from the North Sea, or with neutral
vessels. From the 1st September to the middle of September the policy of
diversion was rigidly followed and upwards of 50 vessels were kept from London
and other East Coast ports. The inconvenience caused was accepted by those
ixmcemed, as heavy air attacks were legitimately expected. Before the middle of
September the number of ship arrivals in home waters generally showed a serious
drop, due largely to the closing of the Mediterranean and the delays to shipping
pending the formation of convoys. For some three weeks the number of arrivals
remained low and, as a considerable thinning out of the East Coast had occurred,
we adopted a policy of letting vessels proceed to London, Hull and Newcastle if
the cargo they carried was sufficient to justify a call at those ports.
4- The first convoys began to arrive early in October. In view of the
renewed prospect of immediate air attack after the middle of October, extensive
diversion was again put into operation; in a letter dated the 13th October it was
plated that " the Admiralty view is that for the next week or so the diversion
r o m London and East Coast ports of trans-ocean shipping coming from the West
[20388] B 2
should be complete. The only exception should be in the case of ships for which
there are overwhelming reasons why they should come to London or other East
Coast p o r t s ."
5. In accordance with the Admiralty advice, vessels wrere drastically
diverted to the West Coast, with the result that, in the latter part of October,
London, Hull and Newcastle were abnormally empty, and the ports on the Bristol
Channel, the Mersey and the Clyde approached their full capacity. A certain
amount of pressure was felt at these ports, but it cannot be maintained that serious
congestion occurred. Had diversion on a drastic scale continued, the pressure
would have become acute, with the consequent threat of congestion.
6. Towards the end of October the Admiralty agreed that, provided the
volume of shipping in the East Coast ports was kept below normal, the policy of
drastic diversion could be relaxed; this was elaborated by a War Cabinet ruling
(23rd October) to the effect that, for the time being, instead of all shipping beino
diverted to West Coast ports, ships should be allowed to use East Coast ports in
special cases where this was necessary to avoid substantially increased expense
or delay that would have serious effects on production.
7. The policy enunciated in the last paragraph is that which guides the
Standing Committee when examining the daily lists prepared by the Ministry of
Shipping of vessels approaching home waters; for reasons which we develop in
paragraphs 17-21 below, we would wish a greater latitude.
8. In Appendix I certain figures are given showing the effects of diversion
in October 1939; sufficient particulars are not available for September to give
similar figures in respect of that month. It should be recalled that diversion is a
delay action : vessels must be signalled several days out and the effect of diversion
is only apparent some days after the policy is adopted. Thus, in the preceding
paragraphs, precise dates have generally been avoided. It should also be recalled
that the total number of ship arrivals in home waters during September and
October was well below normal.
Criticisms.
9. In the second p a r t of October, when vessels were drastically diverted and
when the initial fear of air attack had passed, complaints of the policy were
received from various quarters, and these are summarised below :
10. Consignees generally endeavour to secure delivery of the goods at the
nearest convenient port and thus avoid the costs of inland transport. Diversion
inevitably means expense and delay, whether the goods are on Government or on
private account, and, in the case of certain raw materials with a restricted
market, it may be cheaper to abandon the goods at the port of discharge rather
than pay the transport costs of conveyance to the place of manufacture. Moreover,
many goods imported on private account are urgently required for Government
contracts, and difficulties have been experienced in obtaining delivery of these
goods. Although the Ministry of Supply advise generally on the question of
diversion, it is impracticable for them to ascertain the ultimate destination and
use of all the articles shown on a Manifest. (Eor the views of the Ministry of
Supply on the added expense and inconvenience arising especially from the
diversion of vessels carrving iron ore, see W P (G) (39) 49, dated the 20th October.
1939.)
11. Ports.In peace, most ports specialise in the handling of certain
cargoes. If vessels are sent to unaccustomed ports, delays occur. Moreover, the
drastic diversion from London and other East Coast ports has had the effect of
throwing out of work a considerable amount of dock labour, among which some
hardship and discontent exists, which must, if perpetuated, result in a drift of
dock labour to other employment, with the alternative of industrial unrest. The
restrictions on lighting have had some effect in slowing down the rate of discharge
at the busier ports, and with longer periods of darkness the effect will become
more marked. Certain of the East Coast ports view with serious apprehension
the effect of diversion on their revenue; the Port of London Authority.
example, has fixed charges amounting to £4 millions per annum, which can only
be met from charges on vessels (and goods) using the Thames.
12. Inland Transport.No complaints of a consistently serious character
have been received from the railways of the effect of diversion; there were local
and temporary shortages of specialised rolling-stock. There would be a quicker
clearance if the lighting restrictions were relaxed. To coasting voyages, war
conditions have meant considerable delays, and this factor, combined with the
cost of war risk insurance on ship and cargo and other extra expenses, has caused
the cost of coastwise transport for many commodities to be prohibitive to traders
who have the alternative of rail carriage at pre-war rates. The use of regular
coastwise liners has seriously fallen off, but the reduced carrying capacity of
coasting tramp tonnage has been kept fully occupied. Canals had no difficulty
in handling traffic offered to them. There have been some difficulties about road
transport owing to the requisitioning of motor vehicles and to petrol rationing;
these difficulties, however, are not primarily the result of diversion.
13. Overseas Shipowners.In some cases the effect of diversion to a West
Coast port has been to the convenience of the ocean shipowner, in that, with a
minimum of expense, he has been able to discharge his obligations under the Bill
of Lading. In other cases, and particularly in the case of liners, he has been
handicapped, in that he has been prevented from loading an outward cargo
waiting at an East Coast port. There have been occasions on which a vessel has
been ordered to discharge on the West Coast and then proceeded light to the East
Coast to load the vessel thus running into the danger it was intended she should
avoid.
14. Export Trade.The export trade of the country is based to a
considerable degree on London and on other ports on the East Coast. Few
commodities in a competitive market could stand the extra cost involved in
transport from the East to the West coast for outward loading, and, unless the
ocean vessel is allowed to load cargoes on the East coast, the export trade will be
seriously crippled.
15. Neutral Vessels.There is no direct control over the movements of
neutral vessels in British waters, and hitherto neutrals have not shown any
special reluctance to enter London and the East Coast ports. It is understood,
however, that the lack of British vessels in London during the latter part of
October has caused some apprehension among neutrals, and an important
Japanese line has been enquiring about the possibility of making its European
terminus at another port than London. It is important to encourage neutral
tonnage to come to the United Kingdom, and it is equally important that it should
not make use exclusively of West Coast ports; the best encouragement to enter
ports on the East Coast is the presence of a reasonable number of British vessels.
16. Loss of Tonnage. There has been a substantial loss in the carrying
capacity of the British Merchant Navy, due to the delays involved in the convoy
system and other war conditions. We do not question the wisdom of the convoy
system, realising that, without it, the actual loss would have been greater; but
we must point out that, if the policy of diversion is to be operated solely from the
point of view of safety, further delays to shipping will inevitably occur, with a
further loss in the carrying capacity of the mercantile marine.
Comments on Policy of Diversion.
17. In the preceding paragraphs have been summarised some of the results
of the policy of diversion. It has involved added expense to the nation in the
double handling of goods and in transport costs; it has involved some dislocation
to trade and industry; it has been detrimental to the export trade; and it has
diminished the carrying capacity of the mercantile marine. On the credit side
of the balance sheet is the fact that, had air raids developed, the ships and cargoes
would have been more remote from enemy bases. The credit side may loom larger
should active attack commence.
18. The Air Staff wish to emphasise again their view that, in spite of its
well-known disadvantages and difficulties, the utmost possible measure ot
dispersion of shipping to western ports in war is likely to be the most effective
means of securing our Convoys from air attack.
19. We agree that those responsible for the direction of diversion must be
largely guided by the views of the Service Departments as to the day-to-day risks
to be faced, but we consider that the disturbance of the transport and supply
systems generally caused by diversion is so serious that too much stress should
not be laid on the safety factor-. The effects of diversion are inevitably arbitrary
and fall with very unequal incidence upon the owners and consignees of imports.
20. We would point out that the policy recently adopted has involved a
considerably greater measure of diversion than that agreed by the C.I.D. on the
20th April, 1939 (353rd Meeting; there was some slight modification at the
363rd Meeting); at that time it was contemplated that, while there should be ;i
precautionary diversion from London and East Coast ports generally, all ports
should thereafter continue to function to the maximum of their capacity until
prevented from so doing by enemy action, by congestion or by supply conditions.
21. We submit that the wisdom of continuing the precautionary diversion,
contemplated by the C.I.D. on the 20th April and virtually confirmed by the War
Cabinet on the 23rd October (see paragraph 6 above), is now ripe for reconsideration;
and we suggest that we should now have authority to follow the subsequent
policy contemplated by the C.I.D., viz., that all ports should continue to function
to the maximum of their capacity until prevented from so doing by enemy action,
by congestion or by supply conditions; subject to the provisos that (i) a vessel
should normally be diverted to a port on the West Coast if its cargo for an Easl
Coast port is small and if it will load outwards from the West Coast; and (ii) care
is taken to prevent abnormal movements of vessels to ports on the East Coast.
Problem underlying the Remit.
22. Having set out. our views on the question of diversion generally, we
turn more particularly to the remit itself. This we interpret as an instruction
to consider how goods would be imported into this country on the most
unfavourable assumptions t h a t : 
(a) the East Coast ports are closed to ocean vessels;
(b) the West. Coast ports are, for a variety of reasons (e.g., enemy act ion
congestion, &amp;c.), unable to accommodate all the incoming ocean vessels
The question resolves itself into how vessels are to be discharged and goods
distributed if the remaining port facilities prove inadequate and if all die
disadvantages of diversion set out in paragraphs 10-16 above are to be faced.
A list of ports which normally handle ocean vessels is given in Appendix II.
23. We would observe in the first place t h a t it is difficult for- enemy action
to put a whole port completely out of action for a considerable period. At a few
ports on the Bristol Channel a lucky hit might have this effect, but for ports
generally there is no single target which, if hit, would result in complete paralysis.
24. It is necessary, however, to bear in mind that, for continued prosecution
of the war, this country is dependent on continuous functioning of its port and
transport organisation. It is not enough to be satisfied that enemy action iunlikely
to cause paralysis in a port, and it would be inadmissible to allow
ourselves the benefit of any possible doubt. We are, therefore, working on the
assumption that one or more of the major ports on the East Coast may conceivably
suffer such damage as will disorganise the unloading and distribution of cargoes,
entail a major diversion of ocean vessels to the West Coast for a considerable
period and maintain the remaining ports in a state of congestion. Any lesser
assumption would be blinding ourselves to real if remote possibilities. Moreover,
the effects of a disaster1 would follow hard on the impact; relief measures
to be of avail could not be improvised, but must be quickly operative.
25. The provision of additional deep-water quayage with additional
transport arid warehouse facilities on the West Coast would no doubt bo the
solution. This, however, is essentially a, long-term programme involving great
expense and we agree that, in present circumstances, it is impracticable t"
consider the matter in detail. A solution must be sought in other1 directions h)
ensuring that arrangements can rapidly be made for discharge at other' places
than at the quay side.
The. Facilities on the West Coast for Discharging Vessels.
26. Ocean ships are generally fitted with gear enabling them to discharge
without the - assistance of shore appliances. Discharge can thus take place into
barges or coasters while the ocean vessel is :
(A) at a quay, and the vessel is discharging both to shore and, by its own
gear, to smaller craft lying on the other side;
(B) at buoys in navigable waters within a port;
(C) at buoys or at anchor in some sheltered waters.
27. In Appendix I I I is a list of places on the West Coast whore such
discharge could take place. The list has been limited to places where a vessel of
500 ft. in length and 30 ft. draught could be accommodated. Such dimensions
would cover all those vessels on which the country must primarily depend for the
bulk of overseas imports. While there are a number of other places where smaller
vessels could be discharged, it is considered that there is already adequate port
accommodation for them.
Barges.
28. In Appendix V are notes on some of the di lie rent types of barges and
lighters. This type of craft can rarely be used with safety outside a port; it is,
therefore, only suitable in respect of the places marked " A " and " B " in
Appendix I I I . If barges were used to facilitate discharge, it is necessary to
consider whether additional shore appliances should be provided either in the
form of new landing stages or additional cranes.
29. So far as landing stages arc concerned, we are satisfied that at the
majority of the places where barges could be used there is already sufficient
shallow-water berthage to accommodate the barges; such berth age may in places
be in poor repair, but, in our opinion, in time of emergency it is adequate for
the purpose in mind. We see little justification for the expenditure of large
sums of money in providing new landing stages. Somewhat similar remarks
apply as regards cranes (the rate of discharge overside with ships' gear' into
craft is slow). In certain places, however, some extension of wharfage and the
provision of additional cranes may be necessary and we propose to examine this
matter further.
30. To handle the barges additional tugs would be necessary a rough
approximation would give one tug to each 10 barges.
31. After preliminary consideration we suggest that it would be prudent
to provide a pool of approximately 250 barges (of a capacity up to 100 tons) and.
25 tugs to be transferred as required between the ports marked " A " and " B "
in Appendix i l l.
We suggest that the apportionment of these craft should in the first instance
be as follows :
Barges. Tugs.
Plymouth 30 3
Bristol Channel 100 JO
Mersey 50 70 0
Clyde 50-70 6
32. Possibly a proportion of the: barges could be provided from those now
"i hondon; but if does not follow that they are necessarily suitable! for use in
0 1 her localities. Tugs would probably not be available from London or elsewhere,
h proposed that the Ministry of Shipping should consult with the Port of
boncloi) Authority Lighterage Lmergeney Service Committee on the matter.
''l'cre is a serious shortage of fugs and the Ministry of Shipping propose that
additional fugs shall be acquired or constructed.
33. As it is initially proposed that, barges should only be used in or near
'-'N! principal commercial ports, if is not anticipated that serious difficulties would
as to the supply of labour.
Coasters.
34. At the places marked " A " and " B " in Appendix I I I coasters can
generally be used in addition to barges, though the function of the coaster would
rarely be the same as that of the barge, i.e., direct conveyance from ship to shore
The function is rather to distribute the goods as close to the point of consumption
or processing as possible.
35. At the places marked " C," it is very doubtful whether discharge could
take place into any craft other than coasters. No shore appliances would normally
be required, but considerable additional labour would be necessary, and this would
present real difficulties in the case of the more remote places for which some
special arrangements would have to be contemplated. Additional Customs Officers
would be required.
36. At the places marked " A " and " B " we are satisfied that if
circumstances require, discharge direct into coasters would be feasible and that
the matter can be left to the discretion of the Port Emergency Committee and the
Area Coasting and Short-Sea Shipping Control Committee.
37. As regards the places marked " C," we do not consider that discharge
into coasters (or other craft) should take place unless it is quite clear that no
suitable accommodation within a port is available for the ocean vessel.
38. If, however, circumstances do require discharge into coasters (or other
craft) at places marked " C," we consider that, in order of priority, the places
should be : 
(1) Lamlash.
(2) Tail of the Bank.
(3) Bristol Channel.
The Port and Transit Organisation would take responsibility for directing
a ship to one or other of these places, where it is suggested that a retired officer
of the Mercantile Marine should be stationed. He would maintain contact with
the Area Coasting Committee to ensure that coasters were available and with
the nearest Port Emergency Committee about the vesseFs subsequent movements
He would also have to consult with the Customs authorities as to where the
goods should be entered for Customs purposes.
39. There is complete agreement among us that the practice of discharging
overside from an ocean vessel into craft other than coasters at sheltered anchorages
outside a port (i.e.,-&amp;t places marked " C " ) should if at all possible be avoided.
We have, however, been impressed with a certain conflict of view as to the extent
to which this would be practical, and the goods delivered to shore in the
circumstances envisaged in paragraph 24 above.
40. Accordingly, we have arranged that representatives of the Admiralty,
the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Shipping should visit the Bristol
Channel, the Mersey and the Clyde and, after interviewing representatives of the
Customs and of the pilotage and stevedoring interests at those places, furnish
a report on how ocean vessels are to be discharged on the assumptions :
(a) that a substantial number of vessels are lying at one or more places
marked " C " ;
(b) that the vessels cannot enter a port;
the report should indicate what type of craft could most conveniently be used,
if sufficient coasters are not available.
41. To summarise our views if there is pressure on port accommodation
the following remedies should be successively exhausted :
(1) while the ocean vessel is at a quay, discharge both to shore and overside
into coasters and barges;
(2) at buoys within a port discharge overside into coasters and barges;
(3) outside a port at some sheltered anchorage discharge overside into
coasters.
42. Wc are satisfied that these steps, which may be uneconomical in norni.il
times, offer a considerable resiliency in time of emergency. If these steps should
be unfortunately exhausted we hope to obtain guidance from the small committee
to which we have just referred, as to what further preparations should be made
w to meet the circumstances contemplated in paragraph 24 above. n o
42A. We must observe here that present indications point to a large-scale
scheme for off-loading ships into barges, even if practicable, proving a very slow
process. Should these indications be confirmed if will be clear that the only
remaining relief consists in transhipment into coasters. In paragraph 61 below
W e point out that British coasters are barely adequate for present needs.
42B. We intend, therefore, while awaiting results of our proposed enquiry,
to make the assumption that a substantial number of ocean-going ships may in
emergency require simultaneous off-loading into coasters; arid on this basis work
out what types and numbers of coasters must be made available to meet such a
possible call.
At this stage it is convenient to comment generally on the types of cargo
for which discharge overside into barges or coasters may be suitable.
Grain.
43. Sooner or later grain, whether in hulk or in bags, must go to the mills;
milling capacity is fairly widely spread, but on the West Coast the bulk is in
close proximity to the ports of Southampton, Avonmouth, Sharpness, Cardiff,
Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow. These ports have; special facilities at deep
water berths for discharging grain, and every effort should be made to enable
vessels to proceed to these berths. At certain ports there are floating elevators
which would enable the vessels to discharge into coasters. At places marked " C "
di sell urge of grain would be a lengthy process and should, if possible, be avoided.
Refrigerated Cargoes.
44. These cargoes must be discharged direct ex-ship either into cold storage
or into refrigerated or insulated road or rail vehicles. Apart from exceptional
arrangements in London, it is impossible to place refrigerated cargoes either into
coasters or into barges, and refrigerated vessels must therefore have first
preference on the quayage available. There arc now no British coasting vessels
which are wholly refrigerated; we have considered their provision but are
satisfied that it would be more economical to provide additional cold stores in the
Provinces, and additional refrigerated railway stock, in view of the quicker turn
round which they can achieve. Certain small Danish ships of 1,700 2,000 tons
capacity, which are insulated, might be obtained.
Sue/dr.
45. The principal refineries on the West Coast are at Liverpool and
Orcenock. It should be possible to coaster raw sugar to these places or to London.
Timber.
40. Most ports are well equipped for handling timber, which could be
carried coastwise in an emergency. For a variety of reasons there are greater
difficulties in handling timber from the Pacific Coast than from the Baltic, and
if possible the vessels from the former should proceed to the larger timber ports.
Petroleum.
47. This is a highly specialised traffic requiring discharge into tanks; on
South and West Coasts these are available principally at Southampton,
Avoninouth, Swansea, the Mersey, Preston, Ardrossan and Glasgow. The amount
petroleum which can be carried coastwise is strictly limited.
Other Hani Materials.
48. In general, the ports of consignment for raw materials are determined
considerations similar to those which apply in the case of grain and other
foodstuffs which need processing (see paragraphs 55-57 below). Particular ores,
I'"'example, can only be used in certain works. Generic terms, such as " Iron
J r ( ' coyer a wide variety of special classes of material, so that onward transport
t 0 the original destination is likely to be essential after unloading from a diverted
[20388] c
ocean ship. As regards the possibilities of transhipment for coastal voyage and
their suitability for onward transport, raw materials fall into two main
classes :
Cargoes carried in bulke.g., iron and manganese ores (to the N.E.
Coast, S. Wales, N.W. Coast, Scotland), zinc concentrates (to Swansea,
Avonmouth, only), bauxite (largely to Burntisland), phosphates and other
fertilisers (to Liverpool, London, Ipswich, Bristol, &amp;c), molasses (carried in
tankers to tankage accommodation at Liverpool, London, Hull, Ipswich),
pyrites (to Mersey, Glasgow, Ardrossan, London, &amp;c), sulphur (to Garston,
Manchester, Humber, Tees, Glasgow) and wood pulp. Not only are such
materials needed at specific points, but transhipment and onward transport
with the double handling involved give rise to additional costs out of all
proportion to the cost of the material. In addition, their bulk makes these
materials unsuitable for rail transport, while discharge by ship's gear is
difficult and slow.
Cargoes carried in parcels, bales, &amp;c. (which are easier to handle than
bulk cargoes). Such cargoes could be moved either coastwise or by road and
rail, although the need for recognising specific local demand would still
exist. These materials frequently form part cargoes. To this class belong
(1) metal in bars, ingots and sheets e.g., aluminium, copper, lead, tin;
(2) textile materials, such as wool, cotton, silk, flax, hemp and j u t e ; (3) hides,
skins and leather; (4) esparto and newsprint (in the case of the latter there
are peculiar handling difficulties).
Mixed Cargoes.
49. These cargoes must ultimately be handled within a port, where proper
shed accommodation is available for sorting to marks, &amp;c, but cargoes are usually
stowed in a ship according to destination, and in an emergency there is scope for
discharge overside.
Tramp and Liner Tonnage.
50. In considering the preceding paragraphs regarding the different types
of cargo, it is important to bear in mind the distinction between the tramp and
the liner. The tramp is a bulk carrier, and on any one voyage carries one or
possibly two large bulk consignments for one charterer; in Appendix VI.A. is
a list of the principal commodities imported in tramps.
51. The liner has a regular sailing schedule between specified ports, and,
with the exception of refrigerated liners, the cargoes are generally composed of
a number of separate parcels of different commodities consigned to different
owners; in Appendix VLB. is a list of the principal commodities imported in
liners. The diversion of a liner from her regular port is likely to give rise to
more difficulties of internal distribution than the diversion of a tramp which can
sometimes be arranged without inconvenience to the consignee.
52. In the coasting and short sea trades there is a similar distinction
between tramps and liners. The former normally carry coal, cement, &amp;c.; the
latter carry general goods on a regular schedule.
The Facilities offered by the Smaller Ports.
53. In Appendix IV is a list of the more important of the smaller ports
with an indication of the facilities they can provide.
54. Generally the supply of the small ports is adequate; those which are
normally used by vessels in the coasting trade are reasonably maintained and
could handle a considerably increased traffic. The depth of water and the
facilities offered by the remainder are poor, but with 10-14 ft. of water coastingvessels
should be able to find accommodation for discharging-.
55. We would point out, however, that the small ports have their limitations,
particularly for the distribution of cargoes from overseas. The recent
peace-time tendency has been to establish processing plants for raw materials in
the neighbourhood of the larger ports where direct discharge from the larger
vessel to the factory can take place, or where special facilities have been provided
0 0
for rapid delivery. (See also paragraphs 43-49 above.) Thus the gram mills
close to the major ports; the principal sugar refineries are at London, Livera
l and Greenock; the crushing industry is mainly at Hull and London; about
h-ilf the smelting furnaces are near the ports on the North East coast; similarly
the sawmills, joinery works, &amp;c, for dealing with imported timber are mainly
. tfi e larger ports. By these arrangements transport and handling costs have
been reduced to a minimum.
56. Raw materials of this character must, therefore, go to the larger ports
either in the ocean vessel or in coaster or by rail. Discharge at a smaller port
for onward conveyance would generally be unsound. (It is true that in a limited
number of cases processing plants have been purposely established near to a
small port.)
57. The principal function of the small port must, therefore, in war as
in peace be that of facilitating distribution within a limited area either of
raw materials for which there is a wide market (e.g., coal) or of manufactured
goods (e.g., food-stuffs in packages) which can be consumed within that area.
As indicated in paragraphs 62-67 below it is hoped to secure a greater use of
coasting vessels and the smaller ports for distribution of this type of commodity.
Steps will also be considered for using certain of the small ports with good
facilities for inland transport to processing plants, to relieve the pressure on
the larger ports.
58. We have considered whether there is justification for the expenditure
of money in dredging at some of the smaller ports with a view to obtaining deeper
water and consequently enabling them to take larger ships. We are satisfied
that to achieve any practical result the expenditure would be great, and it is
unlikely that a t the end of the war the responsible authorities would be able to
maintain the harbours in an improved condition.
59. We are of opinion that the more economical method of making greater
use of the small ports is to ensure the use of our existing coasting tonnage to
its full capacity and to supplement the smaller type of vessel with shallow draft
vessels capable of entering most of the smaller ports, as indicated in paragraph 62
below.
Increased use of Coasters and Barges.
60. As indicated in paragraph 28 above, we are satisfied that it is generally
impracticable to use barges outside an estuary, and that therefore they cannot
be used for distribution from one port to another.
61. The question is therefore that of the use of coasters. The number of
British vessels of less than 1,600 tons gross which are suitable for the coasting
trade is approximately 1,000 (see Appendix VII). With the existing delays
due to coastal convoys and routing directions this number is barely adequate for
present needs. If the delays were reduced the effective number of coasters would
be increased, but it is unlikely that the supply would be sufficient if diversion
of ocean shipping of the magnitude contemplated in paragraph 24 above became
necessary.
62. A source from which relief could be obtained is the small Dutch motor
boat which, in peace time was seriously encroaching on the United Kingdom
coasting trade. Many of these vessels are now idle and should the need arise
the Ministry of Shipping propose to consider the chartering of a sufficient number,
to meet demand. We suggest the Ministry of Shipping should consider the
construction of a small reserve fleet of British coasters of about 1,000 tons cargo
capacity with draughts of 11 ft. 6 i n . - l 2 ft. 6 in. which would be cheap to run
and Avould be suitable for discharging to tidal berths.
. 63. In their final Report dated the 15th March, 1921, in which they describe
their experiences during the last war, the Port and Transit Executive Committee
stated (page 7) " Shipping freights rose higher and higher with increased costs
oi working; War Risk Insurance was a n added burden; and the trader, whether
Uncial or private, poured his goods on to the railways which were already heavily
wrdened. It was manifest that unless by some means or other, goods could be
[20388] 2 c
I
forced back on to the coastwise routes a breakdown at the ports must ensue."
The Committee then proceeded to describe their various efforts (which had no
legal compulsion) to secure greater use of coastwise shipping.
64. As explained in paragraph 12 above, the same difficulties are again
becoming apparent; full use is not being made of coasting liner tonnage, which
is in a position to relieve pressure on inland transport generally and, in particular,
can assist in clearing a port when for a variety of reasons congestion threatens.
In large part the reason for the decline in the use of coastwise is economic. n
peace-time freight rates were competitive with railway rates; since the war began
the rates for coastwise transport have materially increased while the rates for
railway conveyance have so far remained unchanged. The rise in costs to the
trader of coastwise transport is due to (a) a substantial additional expense to
him for cargo war risk insurance, and (b) increased freight rates necessary to
cover the cost of ship war risk insurance, delays due to convoy and routeing
arrangements, higher wages, bunkers, pilotage charges, &amp;c. Steps are being taken
with a view to placing coastwise on a basis of equalitj' with road and rail so
far as cargo war risk insurance is concerned; steps are also being taken to reduce
the cost of war risk insurance on the ship, and to minimise voyage delays. We
consider, however, that other action will be necessary if full use is to be made of
coasting vessels. This may imply :
(1) an increase in railway rates;
(2) a subsidy to merchants when shipping coastwise; or
(3) a r b i t r a ry power to prevent traffics suitable for conveyance coastwise from
proceeding by road or rail.
65. Any of these courses presents real difficulties and we understand that
the Rates Division of the Ministry of Transport is keeping under constant review
with other Departments the whole question of the relationship of the charges
made for the various forms of transport, including coastwise, to each other.
66. We have no wish to prejudice that review but we suggest that a clear
distinction can be drawn between (1) goods which have arrived at a port in an
ocean vessel and which require onward conveyance (particularly if the ocean
vessel has been diverted from the original port), and (2) goods which have
originated or been processed in this country and which require transport from
one part of the country to another. The transport of the latter raises tJhe general
question of the competitive position between coastwise shipping and other forms
of internal transport and does not come within the terms of our remit. We are,
however, concerned with the former; it is of great importance that coastwise
shipping should be available to its fullest capacity for preventing congestion at
ports by playing its part in the distribution of imports, and, subject to the
qualifications mentioned in paragraph 67 below, we desire to make the following
recommendations :
(A) A Port Emergency Committee may issue a direction to the owner or
consignee of any goods imported at any port in their district, that the
goods shall not be conveyed from that port by road or by rail.
(B) Before issuing such a direction the Port Emergency Committee shall : (
i) satisfy themselves that, having regard to the nature and to the
destination of the goods (as shown on the Bill of Lading or
other shipping document or to any expressed wishes of the
consignee), the goods could and should reasonably proceed
coastwise for the whole or a substantial part of their journey to
that destination;
(ii) give not less than 24 hours' notice of intention to issue such a
direction to the owner or consignee of the goods or to his agent
at the port, and consider any representations made by him
within that time.
(C) When such a direction has been issued :(
i) the Committee shall furnish particulars of the goods to be so
conveyed to the collector or principal officer of the
Commissioners of Customs and Excise, and to the Area
Coasting and Short Sea Shipping Control Committee;
(ii) the Committee may, if they are satisfied that the owner or
consignee of the goods is not taking reasonable and prompt steps
to arrange for the conveyance of the goods coastwise, request the
Area Coasting and Short Sea Shipping Control Committee to
arrange for the chartering by the Minister of Shipping of
tonnage or shipping space for the conveyance of the goods
coastwise to the nearest available port to the ultimate destination
of the goods at the risk and expense of the owner or
consignee of the goods, there being a lien upon the goods to
cover freight and all other charges;
(iii) the Committee shall not issue any direction regarding the
imposition of penalty rents pending the shipment of the goods
coastwise.
67. We fully realise that this power of direction may deprive the owner or
consignee of his freedom of choice of transport, and it may involve him in added
expense. The safeguard against unreasonable freight rates would be the fact
that the Minister of Shipping would be responsible for the chartering of space or
tonnage in default of action by the owner or consignee.
We recognise that this is am exceptional measure to meet exceptional circumstances
and, therefore, we suggest that the power of direction should not be given
to Port Emergency Committees generally; we suggest that the powers should only
be conferred upon a Port Emergency Committee when the Minister of Transport
is satisfied of the need for such powers at that port, and that in any case they
should only be exercisable for a strictly limited period not exceeding one month,
without prejudice, however, to their extension for longer periods if a case for
their use can be made out.
68. If, in case of necessity, the powers are required, we consider that they
should apply to goods on Government as well as on private account.
68A. Our terms of reference do not permit us to discuss increasing the use
of inland waterways to relieve the burden upon other forms of inland transport:
the question may arise of giving to P o r t Emergency Committees power, in certain
circumstances, to require the onward conveyance of imports by means of canal
transport.
69. We seek your authority to elaborate the proposals contained in
paragraphs 64 to 68. The Treasury Solicitor is already considering whether the
proposals could be brought within the ambit of the existing Defence Regulations.
The Practicability of Filling up Empty Refrigerated Space in London by Rail
from the West Coast.
70- The Ministry of Food have had this question under special consideration.
They have repeatedly called attention to the difficulty experienced in handling
through other ports heavy cargoes of frozen meat which are normally landed in
London; the difficulty has been accentuated by the fact that the cold stores
in London have not been holding the stocks it is customary to hold.
71. The problem of dealing with frozen meat from the West Coast ports
in the event of a large-scale diversion is, firstly, the problem of movement to the
places where it is required for immediate consumption, and, secondly, the disposal
of any surplus imports which are not required for immediate consumption.
72. In considering the matter as affecting London, the Railway Companies
state that they can, in the absence of serious damage to the railways, handle
without difficulty the tonnage of frozen meat required for the London area,
namely, 4,000 tons per week; this would not be put into cold store in London, but
would be distributed to the meat depots from the railway stations. The successful
working of this traffic by the Railways will be largely dependent upon the ability
of the Trade immediately to unload the wagons upon arrival.
73. In addition, the Railway Companies state that, subject to the same
qualification, they can handle also without difficulty a further 4,000 tons per week
of meat, which could be put into cold store, in order to build up stocks. Indeed
the building up of stocks in this way could operate at any time there was a surplus
of frozen meat which could go into cold, store, after needs for immediate
consumption had been met.
74. If the London stocks could be built up in this way, the heavy importations
into the West Coast ports arising out of large-scale diversion of shipping
during the period of an extreme emergency could probably be absorbed much more
readily into the port and provincial cold stores.
75. The Ministry of Food are satisfied, therefore, that, so far as London is
concerned, importations of refrigerated cargo into the West Coast ports (though
undesirable except in extreme emergency) can be dealt with in such a way as
to assure supplies of meat to the London area.
76. While this section refers specifically to meat, the handling of other
refrigerated cargoes, such as butter, has also been taken into account, and the
Ministry of Food are satisfied that the same reasoning applies.
Summary.
77. (a) A considerable measure of diversion of shipping from the East to
the West Coast was effected during September and October; no serious difficulties
arose at West Coast ports (paragraphs 3-8).
(6) Much inconvenience was caused to consignees and to shipowners, resulting
in delays and added expense to the former and inconvenience to the latter; the
effect on the export trade was detrimental, and there was some resulting loss of
carrying capacity (paragraphs 10-17).
(c) The Air Staff wish to secure the utmost possible dispersion of shipping
to Western ports (paragraph 18).
(d) From the point of view of trade, the safety factor should not be overstressed,
and we wish authority to allow all ports to function to the maximum
capacity until prevented from so doing by enemy action, congestion or supply
conditions, provided that vessels on the East Coast are kept below normal
(paragraphs 19-21).
(e) I t is difficult to put a port completely out of action for a considerable
period, but the necessity for a major diversion must be faced with its consequences
(paragraphs 22-25).
(/) There is a considerable resiliency in the capacity of the West Coast ports,
and much extra traffic could be handled within the ports by discharge into barges
or coasters, for which additional shore equipment would be largely unnecessary; a
pool of 250 barges and 25 tugs is proposed (paragraph 31).
(g) Discharge into coasters at certain sheltered anchorages could be carried
out; difficulties about labour may be anticipated, in the case of more remote
anchorages (paragraphs 34-38).
(h) We have asked a small expert Committee to meet representatives of the
pilotage and stevedoring interests on the West Coast, and to furnish a report on
how ocean vessels are to be discharged if accommodation within a port is not
available and if sufficient coasters cannot at the time be provided (paragraphs
39-40).
(j) The supply of small ports is adequate; their function is to distribute
raw materials for which there is a wide market, and manufactured goods. With
certain exceptions, they are unsuitable for the import of raw materials which
require processing at plants established at the major ports (paragraphs 53-57).
(k) There is little justification for expenditure on dredging at the smaller
ports to enable them to take larger ships (paragraphs 58-59).
(I) Increased use can and should be made of coasters to relieve inland transport;
the supply may be unequal to the demand, and as a measure of relief the
Ministry of Shipping should consider the chartering of small Dutch motor boats,
and the construction of a small reserve fleet of shallow-draught motor coasters able
to enter the majority of the smaller ports (paragraphs 60-62).
(m) Before the war, coasters were competitive with road and r a i l : this is
no longer so, owing to the increase in coastwise costs. As in the last war, means
must be found to direct traffic back to the coastwise routes. It is proposed
Port Emergency Committees should in certain circumstances have this power
(paragraphs 64-69). r
in) The continued import of frozen meat into London by sea is most desirable in
extreme emergency it should be possible to handle refrigerated cargoes for
London through the West Coast ports.

NOTE. The Port and Transit Organisation is composed of two Committees
- a Standing Committee consisting of representatives of the Admiralty Air
Ministry, Board of Customs and Excise, Ministry of Food, Ministry of Home
Security, Ministry of Labour, Mines Department, Ministry of Shipping Ministry
of Supply, Ministry of Transport, Treasury, War Office, and Offices of the War
Cabinet and an Advisory Committee which, in addition to the representatives of
the Departments mentioned above, contains representatives of shipowners, traders
port executives, the forms of transport serving the ports and labour.
DIVERSION OF SHIPPING, OCTOBER 1939.
British Vessels exceeding 1,600 tons gross.
The following table indicates the numbers of British vessels which have
been shown on the daily Board of Trade lists, as due to arrive at a United
Kingdom port from the 1st October-28th October (inclusive).
East Coast represents Tyne to Southampton (inclusive); West Coast
represents the remainder.
The original destination is the first port of discharge; the vessel may then
proceed from a West Coast port to an East Coast port or vice versa.
The natures of the " principal cargo " cannot in all cases be guaranteed:
they are based on intelligent assumptions.
Figures in brackets are "net" showing result of diversion.
Included in the figures of vessels originally bound for the East or West
coast are 16 boats which were bound for United Kingdom for orders : 8 were
sent to East, 8 to West coast.
Of 320 vessels due to arrive in United Kingdom ports, 87 (27 per cent.)
came into the East coast, 233 (73 per cent.) into the West coast. Vessels diverted,
68, represent 21 per cent, of all vessels arriving. 44 per cent, of those bound
for the East coast.

Notes on Barges and Lighters.
Barges comprise a large number of vessels of widely varying dimensions, the largest of which
(sailing barges excluded) are probably the Thames barges, such as navigate the Surrey
Canal, with dimensions of 105 ft. long, 17 ft. 9 ins. beam and 4 ft. 9 ins. draught.
All barges are fitted with helms, some have cabins, and some are self-propelled.
Medway Sailing Barges vary from 65-120 tons, usual size 120 tons, and will pass the locks of
the Surrey Canal, i.e., 105 ft. long, 17 ft. 9 ins. wide on a draught of 4 ft. 9 ins.

Thames Lighters (termed by the watermen and lightermen " punts ") are swim ended-vesselsthat
is, they have flat sloping ends, their dimensions average about the same as barges, but
they do not travel far away from the river. Their advantage is that they are less
damageable than barges. Most have no helm ; those fitted with helms are termed " rudder
punts." Lighters have no propelling machinery, no cabins, and are double-ended ; they
are either towed by tugs or float up and down on tide.
