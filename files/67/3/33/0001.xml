SEIZURE OF ENEMY EXPORTS: THE CASE OF
THE JAPANESE SHIP THE "SANYO MARU".
Memorandum prepared by the
Foreign Office.
The question of the treatment to be accorded to
German exports to Japan has been rendered acute by the
sailing of the S.S. "Sanyo Maru" from Rotterdam today,
10th December. She was due in The Downs this evening,
but had not arrived at 7,0 p5m,
2. The Japanese Embassy have pressed for exemption
for this ship from our control, and it was necessary
yesterday evening, when her sailing was notified, to decide
whether we should subject her to the procedure of the
Order-in-Council or not,
3. It was decided to inform the Japanese Embassy
(l) That the ship must be brought into The Downs in
accordance with our notified decision; (2) that, on the
other hand, in accordance with our undertaking to impose
the control "gradually, with leniency", she will only
be subjected to search for a very limited category of
goods. (By that would be meant only goods consigned from
Germany to German firms. But it is understood that no
indication to that effect has been given to the Embassy);
(3) that the Embassy may therefore rest assured that the delay
will be negligible. It. was to be indicated to the Embassy
that this treatment must be regarded as exceptional,
owing to the urgency of the present case. (4) instructions
were issued accordingly to the competent authorities, who
were told that nothing more was to be done than to copy
the manifest, or take some other formal action, and that
the ship should not be delayed for more than 24 hours,
(5) This morning a message was intercepted showing that the!
vessel carried "secret naval goods",and the Admiralty were
informed These would presumably not figure on the manifest
and might only be revealed by most thorough-going search.
(6) The Ministry of Economic Warfare have been informed
this evening that the matter will come before the War Cabinet
tomorrow morning, and that the vessel must on no account be
released before the War Cabinet have had an opportunity of
considering the matter.
