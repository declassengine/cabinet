Mr. Osborne to Viscount Halifax.(Received November 26.)
(No. 221. Confidential.) British Legation to the Holy See,
%Lord, Rome, November 21, 1939.
WITH reference to my despatch No. 215 of the 16th November on the subject
of conditions in Germany, I have the honour to report that I received yesterday
a dual warning, from two sources worthy of serious consideration, that it was
the height of unwisdom to count upon, and more foolish still publicly to predict,
a" early collapse of Germany or of the Nazi Government. My first informant
Jjas a Hungarian lady, a friend and guest of the Hungarian Minister to the
Holy See, who lunched with me yesterday. She has some connexion with
Journalism, and it is her business to be well informed about political conditions,
"ne has Austrian relations whom she had quite recently visited in Vienna. She
toM me that she had discussed the present situation with a number of Austrians
^ all classes, for the most part anti-Nazis by inclination. In all cases she was
^e t and deeply distressed, by the same phenomenon a numbed fatalism, incapable
^looking forward to, still less working, for any change, a resigned hopelessness
10759 [20461]
and a submergence of the personality and of individual hopes and aspiratioi
But this almost oriental fatalism was not necessarily a painful condition aft or
many hopes and fears and delusions deriving from the nazification of Austxh
and subsequent developments, it seemed to be a relief to relapse into a nirvami
of disillusion, and to live as. cheerfully as might be from day to day without
bothering about an incalculable future. My informant was shocked by this
prevalent state of mind, but entirely failed to shame her friends and acquaintances
by her reproaches. She also told me that the losses of the Austrian regiments in
the Polish war had been much exaggerated, and that the young Austrians, when
called upon tofight in Poland, had reverted to their instinctive Austrian loyalty
to military leadership, seemingly indifferent to the fact that the Greater Reich
of Hitler had replaced the Empire of the House of Habsburg. As regards food
conditions in Austria, she said that they were difficult and irksome, hut that there
was enough to eat; the-only - serious thing was. the shortage of fats.
2. It was interesting that on four points she, together with her host, mv
Hungarian colleague, and my other informant. Mgr. Kaas, the former leader of
the Catholic Centre party in Germany and now superintendent in charge of the
Basilica of St. Peter's, were in complete accord; that an early internal collapse
of Germany should on no account be"looked for, even if it were to be expected
at all; that Herr von Ribbentrop had been a disaster for all concerned, as was
even generally realised in Germany too; that if and when the time came for
reaching a settlement with Germany it might well be effected through Gdriii",
possibly in association with the High Command of the German army; and lastly
that everything pointed to the evolution of the present German regime into i
form of national bolshevism.
3. Mgr. Kaas took a very gloomy view of the outlook. He foresaw a long
and savage war, progressivefinancial ruin for all countries concerned and the
bolshevisation of Germany, with unpredictable consequences. In any case numbers
of the Gestapo were unrepentant Communists, and no very considerable change
would be involved in the communisation of the Nazi regime. He warned me
against any expectation of an internal ebullition or collapse in Germany, and
thought it very inadvisable that the Allied press should speculate so freely on
so unlikely a development. The German people, he said, were anything but
disunited, although, of course, there were those who deplored Nazi principles
and methods. Many critics of the regime had been dazzled by the success of
the campaign against the hated Poles. A further element of union now was
the hatred of England which, he warned me, was very real, intense and general.
For the rest the nation had been numbed and battered into acquiescence. German
domestic propaganda was extremely skilful and very successful. The cry oi
" Encirclement " and the real hardships of the rationing system strengthened the
hate campaign against England. Suffering and self-defence tended to stifle
scruples about the regime. And the German people was by nature subservienl
and consequently almost incapable, especially after a long period of regimental ion,
of the organisation of revolt from within. He had nothing to say about disputes
within the party.
4. EnglancTs great mistake, said Mgr. Kaas, had been the disarmament
policy of the Labour party. On the other hand, Hitler's great mistake had been
the rape of Bohemia and Moravia. Both the recent mediation offer of the Queen
of Holland and the King of the Belgians and the Munich bomb outrage presented
inexplicable elements. Was the former the result of a German initiative or
menace1? In any case, it was ill-timed and had only served to reveal the hopeless
incompatibility of the war aims of the belligerents. The Munich outrage was
another enigma. There were elements of plausibility in all three possible explanations
: namely, that it was the work of anti-Nazis, that it was the work oi
anti-Hitler members of the party or the Gestapo, or that it was a manoeuvre on
the lines of the Reichstagfire, carried out with Hitler's knowledge and designed
to stimulate enthusiasm for the Fuhrer and antagonism to England. In any case,
Mgr. Kaas observed, the fact that it was generally accepted as a not particularly
astonishing or abnormal event showed the present moral degradation of the
world. He had no ideas as to future German military policy, but heremindedme
that Hitler bad always relied upon carefully worked out surprises to effect ins
ends.
5. My conversation with Mgr. Kaas, who was as friendly as ever, was not
encouraging, but I imagine that, m spite of his detestation of Hitler and the
Nazi regime, he retains certain patriotic instincts and that, while he would dearly
like to see the liberation of Germany from Hitlerism, he would find it difficult to
reconcile himself to the idea of the defeat of Germany, even Hitlerian Germany
I would request that his conversation with me be regarded as confidential and
that his name on no account be mentioned.
6. I am sending copy of this despatch to the Political Intelligence a
Department. 0

Viscount Halifax to Sir H. Kennard (Angers).
(No. 656.)
Sir. Foreign Office, December 9, 1939.
THE United States Charge d'Affaires asked Sir A. Cadogan at the end of
November if he would receive Mr. Wayne Taylor, of the America a Red Cross,
who had just arrived in London from a tour of Poland and Germany and who
might have interesting things to relate.
2. Mr. Wayne Taylor called upon Sir A. Cadogan on the 1st December and
spoke at some length of the observations which he had been able to make in those
countries. He began by saying that the report that he would have to make was
very "discouraging," which Sir A. Cadogan subsequently realised was meant
to indicate that he would give a picture of German strength and unity.
3. Mi\ Wayne Taylor dealt first of all with German-occupied Poland. He
had been to Warsaw, where the destruction was very considerable. It was
estimated that 30 per cent, of the town was totally destroyed, 35 per cent,
uninhabitable, 5 per cent, intact and the remaining 30 per cent, more or less
severely damaged. This was due to the fact that Warsaw itself had been, in the
last stages of the siege, subjected to very heavy bombardment both from the air
and by gunfire. He said it was notable that one of the few steel and concrete
buildings was a large block rising some twelve or fifteen storeys, which was an
obvious target, and had received a number of direct hits, but had not collapsed.
4. From his own observation the country round Warsaw had not suffered
very much, and from the presence of live-stock close to the main roads if was
clear that there had not been looting and German army discipline had been
maintained. The authorities were apprehensive of the danger of epidemics
during the winter, but precautions against this were being extremely well
organised under a German director, who controlled the Polish authorities.
Several large hospitals had been set up and were apparently eflicient. The actual
number of sick was not at present disproportionate or sufficient to give rise to
apprehensions.
5. In other districts of Poland Mr. Wayne Taylor had witnessed various
scenes of devastation, but it was not in all cases clear whether these had been
caused by the German armies or whether, as alleged by them, in many cases by the
Poles themselves. He had heard stories, chiefly from refugees in Rouinania, of
the deliberate killing of Poles, but he had been unable to obtain any direct
testimony on this point.
0. On the other hand, the Germans were quite clearly undertaking a mass
Movement of the population and were pushing all Poles and Jews into what was
destined according to their plan to be the eventual Poland. They were, of course,
keeping the great bulk of the 700,000 prisoners of war and were employing them
chiefly on agricultural work. lie had not been able to visit any of the camps in
which these prisoners were kept, but he had not heard any very definite allegation
?1 iH treatment or bad conditions. Incidentally he had visited refugee camps
111 Rouniania and Hungary, which he had found on the whole to be tolerably
W('H maintained, though one or two in Hungary had been bad.
7 So far a s he could ascertain, the big Polish landowners who had remained
on their estates had been left unmolested, though their future was uncertain.
It was very doubtful whether those who had fled would be able to enter again
into possession of their estates.
8 With regard to Germany, Mr. Wayne Taylor had been greatly impressed
bv the unity and determination of the population. He said that the war might
not be popular, and that, indeed, might apply to various other countries, but
that he heard little complaining and he thought that the spirit of the German
people on the whole was good. The rationing did not constitute a very great
hardship and, in his view, there was no real shortage of f ood-stufls. Moreover,
if things were properly organised, he anticipated that considerable extra
supplies3would be obtainable next year from Poland. He said that he regretted
to have to make so pessimistic a report, but Sir A. Cadogan assured him
that what we desired most of all was to obtain the most accurate picture available
of conditions in Germany, and naturally he was right to report what he had been
able to ascertain. He said that in view of the mission on which he was engaged
he naturally had to observe a certain amount of discretion and had not liked to
cross-examine those whom he met, but he said he felt bound to warn me that our
task was a very hard one.
9 Sir A. Cadogan ascertained that Mr. Wayne Taylor could hardly
speak any German, though he said he could understand most things, and I should
think therefore that he is not an extremely reliable observer.

HALIFAX.
