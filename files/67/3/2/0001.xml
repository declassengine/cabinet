The King's Speech on the Opening of Parliament.
NOVEMBER 28, 1939.
MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS :
THE prosecution of the war commands the energies of all My subjects.
My Dominions overseas are participating wholeheartedly and with an
effectiveness which is most gratifying to Me.
Throughout the world My Navies, together with the Merchant Navy and
Fishing Fleets, are keeping free and open the highways of the sea. At home,
in France, in the Dominions, in India and in all stations overseas, My Armies
and Air Forces are fulfilling their tasks. I am well assured that they will be
equal to any efforts and sacrifices to which they may be called.
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS :
You will be asked to make further financial provision for the conduct of
the war.
MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS :
Grave responsibilities rest upon you at this time. You will, I am convinced,
express the resolution of the Nation.
The measures which will be submitted to you are such as seem necessary to
My Advisers for the welfare of My people and the attainment of the purpose
upon which all our efforts are set.
I pray that Almighty God will give His blessing to your counsels.
