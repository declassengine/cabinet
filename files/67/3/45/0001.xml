MEMORANDUM RESPECTING GERMAN MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PRISONERS OF WAR
IN GREAT BRITAIN.
THERE are at present about 2 5 0 m i l i t a ry and naval German prisoners of
war in British hands and between 1,200 and 1,400 civilian internees. The
military as opposed to the civilians are interned in two camps, one for officers
and one for other ranks. Crews taken off merchant ships are regarded as civilian
prisoners of war and are sent to civilian camps.
2. With regard to the military and naval prisoners of war (from U-boat
and Air Services), their morale is high and their attitude inclined to be defiant,
not to say hostile. They have an exaggerated admiration for Hitler, and on one
occasion when the Commandant of a camp was telling the prisoners about the
Munich bomb explosion, remarking that " H i t l e r escaped by only 1 5 minutes,"
one of the prisoners drew himself up, clicked his heels and said : " Herr Hitler,
if you please." At the officers' camp the inmates are obviously cowed by the
Senior Officer (one of the chief submarine Commanders in Germany). When he
is present they are all dumb and reply to questions only with head shakes. Most
of the prisoners speak English.
3. Many of them have been fished out of the water and have been provided
with clothes by their captors. One officer was found to have been badly bitten
by a jelly-fish All U-boat men express their respectful horror at the force of
the British depth charges, which they call " Water bombs." Most of them in
their letters express the belief that they will be back in Germany in time for
Christmas. They are reasonably content with their quarters, but complain of
the English white bread as they are accustomed to the German rye and brown
bread.

4. The officer prisoners are extremely suspicious of attempts to extract
information from them. On a recent occasion, an officer, the only survivor of an
engagement, who arrived at the camp alone, was so severely shunned and made
the object of such unpleasant remarks by his fellow captives, who believed hini
to be a spy, that he appealed to the British Commandant for protection.
5. With regard to the U-boat officers, they are mostly on the young side, the
oldest being about 32. They are described as belonging in the majority to the
bourgeois class. The men are young and have not had much sea, experience, but
their training at the U-boat schools in Germany is said to be excellent. Most
of the German Air Force personnel captured appeared to have served with the
German civilian^air lines; . .... :
6. Civil Prisoners.-Gi\i[ internees in Great Britain consist of ardent
Nazis, many of whom are undoubtedly enemy agents;; but also Jews who are either
suspect or have been interned because they- have been' unable to prove their bona
fides. Alien tribunals in England are still working, and it is expected that the
present number of internees may be ultimately increased to 5,000 or even 7.000.
Non-Nazi internees complain bitterly of association with the Nazis, and there have
been instances in which feeling between these two different kinds of Germans has
r u n extremely high. On the whole, however, a curious levelling.process seems to
be developing, so that the most ardent Nazis are becoming much less hostile to
their non-Aryan fellows, while the Jews are learning to get on with and even
admire the Nazis.
7. The prisoners arriving straight out of Nazi Germany betray so clearly
t h e effect of their intensive Nazi t r a i n i n g and their isolation of recent years from
the rest of Europe that it becomes evident that, sooner or later, some sort of
political re-education of these German prisoners will have to be seriously
considered as part of the preparation for the ultimate settlement of Europe.
