"WAR CABINET.
DIVERSION OF SHIPPING: INCREASED USE OF WEST COAST PORTS.
Memorandum by Minister of Shipping.
With his Memorandum dated 29th November (W.P.(G)(39) 122),
the Minister of Transport circulated the Report of the Port and
Transit Organisation (P.T.S.99). I attach short notes on
three points raised in the Report which involve action by my
Department.
1. POOL OF BARGES AND TUGS.
The Report proposes (paragraph 31) the creation of a
pool of 250 barges and 25 tugs to supplement cargo handling
appliances at Plymouth, Bristol Channel, the Mersey and the
Clyde. There is a shortage of tugs and the Ministry of
Shipping propose that additional tugs be acquired or constructed.
It may be possible to transfer a few barges from East to West
Coast. The balance (as well as the additional tugs) will have
to be chartered or purchased abroad. The most promising fields
for this purpose are Holland and Belgium. To build a barge will
take today about three months: to build a tug, about six months,
given priority.
8 * CHARTERING OF DUTCH MOTOR VESSELS.
The Report recommends (paragraphs 61 and 62) the chartering
of Dutch motor craft of the coasting type to supplement British
coasters. I agree and have already persuaded commercial
interests to charter 14 of these vessels averaging 350/400
tons d.w. About 150 vessels of this type are laid up in Holland.

3 , CONSTRUCTION OF SHALLOW DRAFT COASTERSThe
Ministry of Shipping has already taken steps to place
orders for 8 coasting vessels with a draft not exceeding
13'6". Owing to the demands of the Admiralty for small craft,
the smaller yards suitable for building coasters are very fully
occupied. Advantage will be taken of suitable berths as they
fall vacant to build up a small reserve fleet of coasters with
shallow draft as recommended in the Report (paragraph 6 2 ).
I support the Minister of Transport in desiring power to
authorise Port Emergency Committees to direct distribution of
imports in emergency by the appropriate form of internal
transport (road, rail, canal or coastwise shipping) subject to
the safeguards proposed in the Report. In the exercise of any
such power, the Committees should, I suggest, limit their
directions, so far as possible, to goods which are either owned
or completely controlled by a department of the Government itself.
