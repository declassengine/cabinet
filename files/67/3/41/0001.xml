Ichmond Terrace, S.W. 1.

Memorandum from the Minister of Economic Warfare
At its meeting on the 3 0 t h of November the War Cabinet
invited me, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned,
to consider (
a) the effect on Germany's economic position of
stopping importation of iron ore by the sea
route from Narvik,
(b) the counter-measures which Germany might
take in the economic field (e.g. the cutting
off of all exports to this country from
Scandinavian and Baltic countries) and the
effect of these measures on our economic
position.
The accompanying Paper has been prepared by the Ministry
of Economic Warfare to that end. Its conclusions are:(
a) The effect on Germany's economy of a stoppage of Iron
Ore exports from Narvik to Germany is that, whereas there can
be no certainty that such action alone would be decisive, there
is a strong prima facie case to suppose that, if immediately
brought about and if the usual ice conditions are experienced at
Lulea, it would be likely to cause by next Spring such a
substantial curtailment of German steel production as to have a.a
extremely serious repercussion on German industrial output.
Prom the purely economic standpoint, in fact, her position
would, in that event, be so serious as to appear to justify
the risk of considerable handicaps to ourselves in the spheres
of Politics and Supply in order to bring it about.
Nevertheless, valuable as would be the closure of the
Narvik route in itself, the full benefit of this action would only
be secured if it were followed up by impeding exports via Lulea
as well when the ice melts next April. For, whereas the
closure of Narvik alone might not cause more than acute
embarrassment to Germany, the closure of Narvik followed by a
s toppage of exports via Lulea might well bring German industry fco
a standstill/

- 2 a
standstill and would in any case have a profound effect on the
duration of the V/ar.
(b) It would appear that, whereas a stoppage of Iron Ore
exports from Narvik to Germany would, given normal conditions
and provided it were done immediately, be very likely to bring
about severe industrial dislocation in Germany next Spring, there
might well be unfavourable repercussions on certain United Kingdom
supplies - especially Danish bacon - unless and until these
could be replaced from alternative sources of supply. If
Germany succeeded in cutting off all supplies of all commodities
to the Allies from Scandinavia and the Baltic, we should lose
important imports and our war effort in certain directions would
be hampered, but not seriously dislocated. On the other hand,
it would not seem possible for Germany to succeed in cutting off
many of these supplies save by successful military operations,
considerations of which are outside the scope of this Paper.
The military possibilities inherent in the situation envisaged
will no doubt be pronounced upon by the Naval, Military and Air
Staffs who would be concerned, but, from the economic standpoint
it would appear that, in either event, the damage likely to be
caused to Germany by the prompt carrying out of the action contemplated
would heavily outweigh any damage which could be
caused to us by her retaliatory measures.
As stated above, I was charged by the 7ar Cabinet to consider
this question in consultation with the other Ministers
concerned. The Ministries of Supply and Food were accordingly
consulted during the preparation of this Paper, and the Paper
'hen completed was again submitted to them, and also to the Board
Trade and the Ministry of Pood for their comments.
Comments/
v

Comments from all four Departments have- been received, and
y be summarised by saying that in their view the Paper on the
one hand exaggerates the probable effect of the action proposed
upon German economy, and on the other hand minimises the
difficulties and dangers which might result upon our own position.
The Board of Trade point out that Germany has already
lost access to sources from which she drew some 8 - or 9 million
tons of Iron Ore in 1933 and that the present proposal would only
reduce her imports by a further one million tons over the next
four months, a diminution which would be largely made up after
April next. The Board of Trade, supported by the Ministry of
Supply, consider that this v/ould seem a small return for the
cumulative effect of the possible retaliation on us.
All four Departments stress the difficulties with which
we should be faced if we were cut off from Scandinavian resources.
The particular dengers pointed to are:m
a
1. the danger of jeopardising our chartering of Norwegian ships,
2. the strain on our shipping if it were necessary to bring
supplies from more distant parts. This would be still greater
if we lost the use of Norwegian ships,
3. the fact that certain supplies obtained from Scandinavia are
difficult, and in some cases perhaps impossible, to replace.
Of these the most important are paper-making materials, certain
ferro-alloys, iron ore, aluminium and arsenic,
k- the practical difficulty of suddenly changing over to an
unusual source of supply, even where such alternative source is
available,
5- the serious, though not disastrous, effect upon our food
Position if imports from the Scandinavian countries were to cease,
especially in regard to butter, bacon and fish. Denmark is the
only considerable Scandinavian supplier of the two former; we
obtain fish both from Denmark and Norway,
6' the strain on our finances which would be entailed by changing
o ver to the American countries which are the alternative sources
in the/

- u in
the great majority of cases.
While I would in no way wish to underrate the difficulties
to which the comments of the other Departments concerned draw
attention, it is perhaps legitimate to observe that, provided
the proposed action in respect of Narvik could be taken without
incurring the serious ill-will of the Scandinavian countries,
nothing but a German invasion of Norway would be likely to prevent
our obtaining our supplies from Norway and Sweden (with the
important exception of timber) through the Norwegian ports of
Bergen and Trondjhem. Nor would the proposed action be regarded
s successfully accomplished unless it were done in such a way as
to cut off supplies of Swedish Iron Ore from Norway to Germany
ithout interfering with supplies to us from that port,
Without invading Norway German retaliation would therefore be
Confined to stopping Danish food ships from proceeding to the
'nited Kingdom, and. there can be no guarantee that Germany will
ot take such action whether the proposed steps at Narvik are
gelded upon or not. It is likely, of course, that Germany would
png all possible pressure to bear upon Norway to refuse further
ales or shipments to us, but the economic consequences to Norway
puld be so disastrous for her that she might well hesitate to do

PART I.
Effect on Germany's Economic Position of stopping
the importation of Iron Ore by sea route from Narvik
1. Germany, together with the territories now occupied by her,
is very deficient in Iron Ore. Her stocks of Iron at the
beginning of September were low. Subsequent action by the
Allies has cut her off from those overseas sources of supply from
which in 1938 she drew over UO% of the 22 million tons
of Iron Ore which she imported, and if she is to avoid a
major industrial breakdown, she must import, during the
first year of war, at least 9 million tons of Iron Ore from
Sweden, or at the rate of 750,000 tons a month, in spite of
recent developments of her low-grade domestic deposits.
This figure is regarded as essential to avoid such a breakdown
even should her military consumption remain at its
present low level.
The principal Swedish Iron Ore deposits are situated in the
Northern part of that country close to the Finnish frontier
in the province of Norbotten and there is a second but
smaller field North-West of Stockholm in the Province of
Kopparberg. In recent years, German imports of Swedish Iron
Ore from the Northern ore-field have been shipped partly
from the Norwegian ice-free port of Narvik on the Atlantic
and partly from the Swedish port of Lulea on the Baltic.
Eor four months of the year, however, namely from mid-
December to mid-April, Lulea is normally blocked with ice,
so that during that period Narvik is the only outlet for
the Northern field. In peace-time, shipments from Narvik
would, therefore, now be increased as a result of the
closing of Lulea and, from the number of German vessels
at present/

- 2 at
present bounc. northward through Norwegian territorial
waters it is apparent that Germany intends to follow the
same plan this year so far as our Naval activity will permit
her to do so.
Shipments to Germany from the Southern Swedish
ore-field go, in war as in peace-time, from Swedish ports
in the Baltic which are ice-free all the year round, the
most important of which are Oxelosund and Gavle.
Annexed hereto is a paper entitled "Germany - Supplies of .
Swedish Iron Ore" which fills in something of the background
against which this paper is written.
It is not possible to persuade Sweden to permit the export
of Iron Ore to us and not to Germany. To ask her to
prohibit this export altogether would deprive us of a
source of supply which would, have to be replaced from other,
and perhaps less convenient, sources: nor would she in any
case agree to such a proposal. In the War Trade Agreement
with Sweden, now signed, she is to continue exports of Iron
Ore to both belligerents on the basis of "normal trade"
which will allow Germany to take slightly more than
9 million tons in the first year of the War, provided that
she can obtain shipment and delivery of it. On the other
hand, although it is not mentioned in the War Trade Agreement,
the representatives of the Swedish Government have
privately undertaken to endeavour by various means to reduce
Iron Ore shipments to Germany to the lowest point possible
without provoking German reprisals upon Sweden. This secret
undertaking, however, was only given on the understanding
and in the expectation that shipments of ore via Narvik
would be prevented by us,. Most of the expedients
c out emplat ed/

- 3 contemplated
by the Swedes for reducing shipments are to be
applied in respect of the great Northern ore-field and they
largely depend for their effect upon shipments becoming
impossible during the Winter months owing to the freezing of
Lulea and the stoppage by British Naval action of shipments
to Germany from Narvik.
Since Narvik is in Norway the attitude of that country is
material and it is already plain that there is no prospect
whatever that the Norwegian Government will agree to interfere
with the passage of this ore through their territory.
They regard it as a Swedish export and a matter to be
settled between the Governments of Sweden and the United
Kingdom.
The theoretic aggregate capacity of Oxelttsund, Gavle and
other Swedish ice-free ports is about 1 million tons a
month, but, when other factors are taken into account such
as the capacity of the railways to deliver Iron Ore to them
and the rate of output of the mines in the Southern orefield
which alone are readily accessible to these ports,
it is believed that the maximum rate of delivery during the
winter months will not exceed 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 tons a month. This
rate could be increased by a re-organisation of Swedish
transport facilities to permit shipment from these ports of
ore derived from the Northern field, but this, even if
compatible with the nnormal trade" provisions of our War
Trade greement with Sweden, would entail a disorganisation
of Sweden1s transport system which could not be brought
about for a long time especially now that partial
"mobilisation has been imposed, and an extensive armament
programme undertaken, nor would Swedish public opinion in its
present/

- h present
temper be likely to countenance such a step,
in the first three months of war, Germany has imported, from
Sweden a little more than 2-g- million tons of Iron Ore, and
the importance of the Narvik route lies in the face that
between now and next April, while Lulea (from which, since
September, over 30% of Sweden's ore exports to Germany have
been made) is likely to be frozen, the closure of the
Narvik route might be expected to reduce the total German
intake of Swedish ore to not more than 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 tons a month.
In fact, during the first three months of War, shipments of
Iron Ore to Germany from these Southern Swedish ice-free
ports was 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 tons, 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 tons and 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 tons
respectively. If the rate of shipment from these ports
shows no further increase and the usual ice conditions
prevail at Lulea and if no significant shipments take place
from Narvik, the total intake of Swedish Iron Ore by
Germany in the first eight months of war v/ill be only
about h f million tons, or at the rate of under ?i million
tons a year. Should shipments from these Southern Swedish
ice-free ports increase during the winter to what'is
"believed to be the practical maximum capacity of these ports,
i.e. 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 tons a month and if there are no supplementary
imports from Lulea or Narvik, the total German intake for
the first eight months of War will have been only about
5f million tons, or at the rate of 84p million tons a year.
Both these figures are below the calculated minimum of
9 million tons a year. In other words, exports from the
Southern Swedish ice-free ports only, even if they should
attain the maximum rate of 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 tons a month would create
a
shortage of 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 tons a month, or 1 million tons by the
end/

(
end of April. To put it at its lowest this would certainly
mean acute industrial embarrassment for Germany.
Should Germany's reserve of Iron Ore, small though it was
at the outbreak of war and probably further reduced by now,
enable her to tide over such an industrial crisis next
April, a resumption of deliveries from Lulea when the ice
has melted in the Gulf of Bothnia should enable Germany to
increase her imports of Swedish Iron Ore to a level which,
even without the use of Narvik would permit her to increase
her total Swedish import to a figure of at least 9 million
tons by the end of the first year of war. Thereafter,
the situation is unpredictable, the more so as by the end
of 19h-0 supplies from Russia may become available. It
follows, therefore, that by far the greater effect upon
Germany's economic position of a stoppage of Narvik supplies
would be obtained by taking steps to effect such a
stoppage immediately.
10. The conclusion which may be reached as to the effect on
Germany's economy of a stoppage of Iron Ore exports from
Narvik to Germany is that, whereas there can be no certainty
that such action alone would be decisive, there is a strong
prima facie case to suppose that, if immediately brought about
and if the usual ice conditions are experienced at Lulea,
it would be likely to cause by next Spring such a substantial
curtailment of German steel production as to have an
extremely serious repercussion on German industrial output.
Prom the purely economic standpoint, in fact, her position
would, in that event, be so serious as to appear to justify
the risk of considerable handicaps to ourselves in the
spheres of Politics and Supply in order to bring it about.

Nevertheless, valuable as would be the closure of the Narvik
route in itself, the full benefit of this action would only
be secured if it were followed up by impeding exports via
Lulea as well when the ice melts next April. For, whereas
the closure of Narvik alone might not cause more than acute
embarrassment to Germany, the closure of Narvik followed by
a stoppage of exports via Lulea might well bring German
industry to a standstill and would in any case have a
profound effect on the duration of the War.

The counter-measures which
Germany might take in the economic
field (e.g. the cutting off of all
exports to this country from
Scandinavian and Baltic countries),
and the effect of these measures
on our economic position.
The counter-measures which Germany might take in reply to
action by us to cut off her supplies of Swedish Iron Ore
from Narvik would be likely to vary in accordance with the
general strategical situation and the nature of the steps
taken by us to effect our object. It is for the Chiefs of
Staff, having considered the methods open to us in effecting
our object, to state the nature of the reprisals which the
enemy are likely to carry out and whether they will be
military or economic in character.
In either event, the question would appear to require
us to consider the effect of our action in its most
disadvantageous light and to assume that German action might
be effective in cutting off all our supplies from Scandinavia
and the Baltic countries.
Norway is of chief value to the Allies as a source of ferroalloys,
aluminium, zinc, calcium carbide and, to a lesser
extent, fish, timber, wood pulp, Iron ore, milk and eggs,
She has also agreed to charter to us 1-g- million tons of oil
tankers and in addition not less than 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 tons deadweight
of tramp steamers by the 3 1 s t March next as existing charters
expire, a figure to be increased later, if possible.
Pish can be caught off our own shores and imported from
elsewhere, though without Norwegian supplies a shortage would
he created. Increased supplies can be obtained of timber and
wood/

- 2 wood
pulp from Canada, though to do so would impose a great
strain on available shipping. We hope to import about
700,000 tons of Iron Ore from Norway during the first year
of the War. Imports of milk and eggs are relatively
unimportant in quantity.
Norway and, to a lesser extent, Sweden are, however, at
present our sources for supplies of certain ferro-alloys
(ferro-chrome and silico-manganese) and calcium carbide, but
even these commodities could be purchased from the United
States and shipped to this country. Admittedly the haul
v/ould be longer than from Scandinavia and dollars would have
to be provided to effect the purchases instead of Norwegian
or Swedish Kroner, but these latter currencies are not easy
ones and it is submitted that the disadvantages involved for
us in replacing these supplies from the United States would
be small when compared with the advantages which we would be
likely to gain from the stoppage of German Iron Ore imports
from Narvik.
The ores necessary for the manufacture of the
ferro-alloys concerned are obtained by Norway and Sweden
chiefly from the British Empire and other sources open to us.
Measures are being taken to produce in England the ferroalloys
concerned, but it will take some months before these
are able to be completed and even then we shall be able to
produce, pending further expansion of our capacity, only a
part of our estimated needs. Certain other ferro-alloys
which we require, such as ferro-molybdenum and ferro-vanadium,
are at present obtained by us partly from Norway and Sweden,
but our supplies from these sources could be replaced without
difficulty.
We/

We also require to import from Norway about
9,000 tons of aluminium during the first year of the War,
without which aeroplane production would be retarded, unless
the supplies were replaced from the United States. This
could easily be done, although at some extra cost. Further,
Prance desires to import zinc from Norway.
Finally, if it becomes impossible for ships to
leave the Baltic for United Kingdom ports, the only way
whereby Finnish and Swedish goods could reach us would be
overland to Norwegian ports on the North Sea.
Sweden is of value to the Allies as a source of Iron Ore,
Ferro-alloys, Charcoal Pig Iron, Charcoal Steels made therefrom
and other special steels, and, to a lesser extent, of Timber,
Wood Pulp, Paper and Bacon. An advantageous agreement
with Swedish shipowners is also just coming into operation.
We hope to import 2-g- million tons of Swedish Iron Ore
during the first 12 months of the War, but if this were no
longer available to us these supplies could be replaced from
other sources, although not without some inconvenience to us.
Swedish Charcoal Pig Iron has certain unique qualities which
are valuable for war purposes and, as an example of this,
it may be mentioned that steel wires made from special steels
derived from this Charcoal pig Iron give substantial
advantages for balloon barrage purposes as compared with any
others obtainable. Swedish Bacon could be dispensed with
although it is quite a useful subsidiary source of supply,
while Pulp, Paper and Timber would be serious loss which
Qould not be entirely replaced from other sources, at least
I n
corresponding qualities. It must, however, be recognised
that/

- k that
these commodities from Sweden are very likely to he
lost to us at any time, unless they are routed by rail across
Norway for shipment from Bergen or Trondjhem, whether we
-
interfere with German imports of Swedish Ore from Narvik or
not. Already some of these bulky cargoes are proving difficult
to bring here by water in view of the German interference with
Swedish goods passing out- of the Baltic.
Denmark is of great value to us as a source of dairy produce of
-
all kinds, and particularly of Bacon, Butter and Eggs.
These supplies from Denmark, although of importance to us,
are, it must be recognised, already extremely precarious and
may well be cut off at any time through German action,
whatever course we may pursue. The greatest difficulty is
with regard to Bacon, of which between LO per cent and
50 per cent of our total imports is derived from Denmark.
This position will, however, be substantially eased in about
four months' time, provided that the Atlantic sea routes can
be kept open to enable increased supplies from Canada to be
brought in. Butter and Eggs are a less serious problem,
particularly in the case of the former, which, were it not
for the shipping difficulty, could probably be replaced now
by imports from the Dominions, and that at cheaper prices,
if the necessary sea transport were available.
So far as Finland and the Baltic States are concerned, exports
to this country a r e already extremely precarious, quite
apart from the present position in Finland, since the Germans
are interfering with all cargoes leaving the Baltic except
those in vessels of sufficiently shallow draught to emerge
from the Baltic inside the Swedish three-mile limit. In the
conditions contemplated, this traffic also would, of course,
be prevented/

be prevent.ed, -but , already- a-certai n amount-of Baltic, and
Finnish produce is coming to us after a short sea trip
across the Baltic to Oxelosund and Gavle and thence by rail
across Sweden and Norway for shipment from Bergen or
Trondjhem. Our imports from these countries, leaving out of
account Timber and Minerals' from Finland, which we cannot
in any event now hope to retain, are dairy produce
(particularly Butter) and Flax and Flax Seeds, These latter
items are particularly important since they cannot be
replaced from other sources. Their loss would not, however,
be in any way fatal to our war effort and we must be ready
to forego them at any timCj whatever may be the position
regarding interference with German imports of Swedish Iron
Ore from Narvik.
Although it has been necessary tu consider the effect upon
our position of a total stoppage of our imports from all
these sources, it must be borne in mind that in the event
of our retaining Scandinavian goodwill, Germany would not
be able to prevent exports from Norwegian ports of goods
drawn from Norway and Sweden without drastic military
action against Norv/ay and probably Sweden also. In these
circumstances it becomes material to consi^x- thQ attitude
of these countries.
The reaction in Norv/ay to interference by us with German
imports from Narvik would depend to a certain extent on the
measures which we might take to effect our object and on
such justification as might exist tor our action, Though
her sympathies are with us, Norway is genuinely afraid of
German bombers, asid this fear causes her to cling to strict
neutrality. She will not, therefore, volwtn-. jjx io at
our request/

our request anything which is unneutral and, acting in fear.,
of Germany, is likely to feel hound to resist any actions
of ours which could he considered to infringe her neutral
rights.
To prove that she had not become our accomplice
and to save herself from German retaliatory action, she might
therefore, were we to take forcible measures to deny Narvik
to exports for Germany, denounce the Shipping Agreement
with us, refuse to enter into a War Trade Agreement or to
supply us with the commodities usually obtained by us from
her, and perhaps even resist by force any forcible measures
we might take. On the other hand, it should perhaps be
mentioned, to give a true picture of the Norwegian attitude,
that many Norwegians have long assumed that in the event of
war with Germany we should insist on "controlling" the
entire Norwegian coastline.
On the other hand, to bomb Norwegian towns would not in
itself enable Germany to get Swedish Iron Ore via Narvik
if it had been closed by us. Moreover, Norway must live,
and to do so she must charter her ships to some customer,
of which we are the most important; she must continue to
sell her fish, aluminium, ferro-alloys and other products
if she is to avoid serious loss, unemployment and general
economic dislocation. In time of peace, the Allies
purchased hO per cent of her exports and supplied 3 0 per cent
of her imports. Finally, with or without a War Trade
Agreement, we could still prevent her from supplying Germany
with whalo oil and the bulk of her catch of fish, for the
fish industry is dependent on us for supplies of fuel oil,
ropes, nets etc.

2 2 . Sweden appears to be less susceptible to German pressure
than Norway, and the temper of her public opinion is such
that it appears likely that she would continue to export to
us for as long as it were possible for her to do so and to
refuse to cut off her trade with us unless actually made to
by military measures. Germany has already applied strong
pressure to Sweden to cease her trade with the Allies, and
her action in extending her mine field from the Swedish
four-mile limit to the three-mile limit has merely succeeded
in arousing intense public indignation in Sweden. This has
reacted upon the Swedish Government and is partly responsible
for the present attempts to form a Coalition Government and
possibly also for the signature of our War Trade Agreement
with Sweden. It is believed that any action we might take
to prevent German imports of Swedish Iron Ore by the Narvik
route would be secretly welcomed in Sweden and would
certainly not cause her to modify her policy towards the
Allies unless forced to do so by military measures.
23. Denmark would not be directly concerned and, in the present
unhappy circumstances, the attitude of Finland and the
Baltic States is hardly material.
21*. To summarise the effect of the attitude of the countries
concerned is to realise that it is improbable that Germany
would succeed by any pressure short of active military
measures in preventing shipments of Norwegian and Swedish
produce to the United Kingdom from Bergen and Trondjhem.
These ports are connected with Sweden by rail and it would be
perfectly possible by full employment of existing rail
facilities for exports from Norway and Sweden to continue
from them at the present rates provided only that almost all
Timber/

Timber were excluded. Moreover, there seems to be no reason
why exports of Swedish Iron Ore to the United Kingdom from
Narvik should cease, even if by our Naval action exports of
such Iron Ore to Germany from that port v/ere prevented.
In conclusion, therefore, it would appear that, whereas a
stoppage of Iron Ore exports from Narvik to Germany would,
given normal conditions and provided it were done immediately,
be very likely to bring about severe industrial dislocation
in Germany next Spring, there might well be unfavourable
repercussions on certain United Kingdom supplies - especially
Danish Bacon - unless and until these could be replaced from
alternative sources of supply. If Germany succeeded in
cutting off all supplies of all commodities to the Allies from
Scandinavia and the Baltic, we should lose important imports
and our war effort in certain directions would be hampered,
but not seriously dislocated. On the other hand, it would
not seem possible for Germany to succeed in cutting off
many of these supplies save by successful military operations,
considerations of which are outside the scope of this Paper.
The military possibilities inherent in the situation envisaged
will no doubt be pronounced upon by the Naval, Military and
Air Staffs who would he concerned, hut, from the economic
standpoint it would appear that, in either event, the damage
likely to be caused to Germany by the prompt carrying out of
the action contemplated would heavily outweigh any damage
which could be caused to us by her retaliatory measures.

SUPPLIES OF SWEDISH IRON ORE.
1. The Ministry of Economic Warfare's Paper No. l/81/l
dated 27th October 1939 showed that to achieve her 1938
steel output, Germany had to import altogether 22 million
tons of iron ore. Of this, 9^ million tons came from
sources closed to Germany in war, and a further 9 million
tons came from Sweden. To maintain the 1938 ra.te of output
in the first year of war Germany must import about 18 million
tons of iron ore.
2. The present relatively low rate of wastage by the
German Armed Forces may render possible some reduction in
the consumption of steel below the 1938 level. Nevertheless,
(a) a complete stoppage of Swedish, exports of iron
ore to Germany now would, barring unpredictable
developments, end the war in a few months.
(b) Germany must import in the first year of war
at least 9 to 12 million tons of Swedish iron ore,
if she is not to risk an industrial breakdown,
- whether military activity increases or not.
It follows that the greater the reduction of Swedish
exports of iron ore to Germany below that level in the
first year of war, the greater the chance of Germany's
industrial breakdown or of making her risk a desperate
effort to force an issue before that breakdown occurs.
The loading capacity of the ports from which the ore
is exported now exceeds that of the railways to deliver
ore to them. The rate of loading is reduced during winter,

- 2 in
the case of Narvik as well as of Lulea, by the ore
freezing in the trucks. No remedy for this is known.
Taking these factors into account the following table
gives the present maximum theoretic delivery rates in
summer and winter.
Theoretic present theoretic
loadiiig capacity, maximum deliveries,
-(mcnthlvj (monthly)
SUMMER WINTER
(1,500,000) 1,050,000 750,000

Gavle and other
Baltic ports. (100,000) 80,000 80,000
TOTAL 2,180,000 1,280,000
Prom this it would at first seem that even without
shipments from Narvik, Germany might expect to receive
from Sweden in the first year of war some 12 million tons
of ore.. More than that the Swedes are unlikely to supply
unless further terrorised into submission.
4. Whether this rate of supply, together with her small
stocks of iron, would suffice to keep Germany going for the
first twelve months of war is a moot point. But it is not
the first twelve, but the first seven to eight months which
are at present causing her grave concern. As in the case
of petroleum, a critical point may well be reached next
spring owing to the slowing down of the rate of supply
in winter. Should she weather this crisis, Germany hopes
that the quicker flow in summer will tide her over until
the winter of 1940, by when Russia may have begun to supply
her with iron in some form.

the total shipments of Swedish iron ore to
Germany in September and October were, in fact, only
791,000 tons and 890,000 tons respectively.
September. October.

Baltic ports ... 78,600 71,600
TOTAL . . . 7 9 1 , 0 0 0 890,000
Thus, if she can be prevented from making use of
Narvik from now on, Germany's maximum and minimum imports
of ore from Baltic ports alone between September and April
next inclusive, whereafter the Gulf of Bothnia may again
be open to traffic, are likely to be:-
Probable Probable
maximum. minimum.

October 890,000 890,000
November 900,000 900,000
December ....... 750,000 750,000
January 530,000 350,000
February 530,000 350,000
March 530,000 350,000
April 530,000 350,000
Total for eight
months 5,1+51,000 h, 731,000
There is some doubt whether even the maximum rate will
suffice to stave off a crisis.in German affairs next spring.
Germany is therefore now trying to increase the rate
of supply by
(a) bringing pressure upon Sweden to increase output
and delivery by every means
(b) erecting at Oxelosund additional loading
facilities which will increase considerably the
capacity of that ice-free port.

(c) chartering from the Russians a heavy arctic icebreaker
to keep Lulea1 open for as long as possible,
(d) sending ships to Narvik to recommence deliveries
from there,
and it is suggested that the future course of the war might
well be deeply affected by the defeat of these measures or
of any others which Germany may embark upon in order to
increase her supply of Swedish iron ore between now and next
May.
