WAR CABINET.
DOMINION AIR TRAINING SCHEME.
kemorandum "by the Chancellor
of the Excheauer.
At the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 11th
December, 1939 (w. M. .(39) 111th Conclusions, Item 7) the
Secretary of State for Air referred to telegrams from Canada
in which the Canadian Prime Minister was pressing strongly
that pupils of Canadian origin after passing out of the
Training Scheme in Canada should be formed into units of the
Royal Canadian Air Force in the Field while at the same time
the cost of those units should be met by the British
Government.
The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for
Air, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and me to
examine the latest developments and to settle the matter
without further reference to the War Cabinet if no point of
principle was involved. Meetings have been held at which
the subject has been fully discussed, and in the result we
have drafted the attached telegrams for transmission to
Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In those telegrams we
have suggested a basis on which, without increase of Canada's
financial burden, Mr. Mackenzie King's desire that pupils
of Canadian origin should be formed into units of the Royal
Canadian Air Force in the Field can be substantially met
without infringement of the important principle that Dominion
units should not be paid for by the United Kingdom Exchequer.
Although nc point of principle is involved in the
line we are taking, the matter is of such importance that

we think the War Cabinet should he aware of the latest
developments, and we accordingly submit the draft
telegrams for approval.

My Telegram No, of 11th December. Following
for yourself and Riverdale.. Begins. Ministerial
Committee have now fully studied the problem amd their
conclusions have been endorsed by the War Cabinet.
2. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are
only too anxious, as indeed they have been fawm- tixs ouis^t^
to see a substantial-contingent of the R.CA.F. (as well
as of the other Dominions) in the European theatre.
3. They are impressed, however, with the practical
difficulties in the way of incorporating the whole of the
output of the Training Scheme into balanced R.C.A.F.,
R.A.A.F., and R.N.Z,A.F0 units and they have every confidence
that the Dominions will equally appreciate the reality of
those difficulties if they are fully explained to them.
4. We had anticipated that these difficulties would
have been dealt with in the discussions provided for in
paragraph 15 of the Agreement, but since the Canadian Government
wish to have them cleared up before signing the
Agreement you should now make a full statement of them as
set out in our telegrams Nos. 644 and 645 of the
9th December.
5, As indicated above, we are and always have been in
favour of a strong R.C.A.F. contingent and we are also in
the fullest sympathy with the desire of the Canadian
Government that their personnel trained under the Scheme
should continue to be identified with their Dominion
when serving overseas.
6. To meet this natural wish within the limits of the
practical difficulties explained in our two telegrams referred
to we make the following proposals, which of course involve

some modification in the financial plan contemplated
in the draft Agreement, and consequently some amendments
to Articles 14, 16 and 170
7. That plan provides for a total contribution
by Canada of some 350 million dollars over a three-year
period and our suggestion is that a calculation be made
of the number of R 0 C A . F o squadrons which could be trained, o
equipped, sent overseas and maintained in respect of
equipment, flying personnel and ground personnel for the
sum referred to over a similar period of three years.
8. R.C.A.P. squadrons, with corresponding higher
formations, would be formed up to the total so calculated
and at such a rate as becomes possible by the output
from the Scheme of trained ground personnel and aircrews.
9. We realise that the Training Scheme as at present
drawn contemplates that there shall be retained in Canada
a large body of skilled ground personnel who anight
otherwise be drafted to the theatre of war for manning
R.C.A. F . squadrons,, In order that this feature of the
Scheme shall not impose an undue delay in the formation of
R.C.A. F . squadrons, we will undertake to train, in
technical training establishments in the United Kingdom, any
mechanics whom Canada could spare after meeting the initial
needs of the Training Scheme0 At the same time we will
also undertake, as soon as we can make them available, to
despatch skilled men to Canada in order to release a
corresponding number of R 0 C o A . F . mechanics for service with
R.C.A. F . units overseas,,
10, It will be appreciated that the Scheme outlined
above has the following merits:

1, It does not increase the financial burden upon
Canada.
2. It preserves the principle to which we have no
doubt the Dominions attach as much importance
as His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom,
that the cost of such contingents as the
Dominions may feel able to put into the field
should be borne by their own exchequers.
3. It achieves the homogeneity within units which is
so essential for the reasons elaborated in
paragraph 2(2) of our telegram No.645.
11. It is true that a proportion of the pilots
and aircrews produced by the Scheme cannot be absorbed
in Dominion units, but we would propose that in order to
identify them with the Dominions to which they belong they
should wear on their uniforms, while serving with the
R.A.F. , such distinguishing emblem as each Dominion
may select.
12. Please use your best endeavours to secure agreement
of the Canadian Government to the above proposals,, Ends.

Following for guidance of Riverdale and yourself*
Begins -
We ought to make it clear that what we have in
mind by paragraphs 7. and 8. of our immediate preceding...
telegram is not that Canada-shall provide-the---star ling
required for the equipment and maintenance of the
Squadrons when formed but that she shall as at present
contemplated continue to bear the expenditure in Canada
on the training Scheme and that she shall be given
a credit amounting to the cost of equipping and
maintaining the Squadrons as and when they are formed.
A rough calculation made over here suggests that
it would be possible on the basis suggested in our
telegram to have an independent air contingent
amounting ultimately to 15 Squadrons.
In effect the result would be as follows,
Canada would bear the expenditure on the Training Scheme
in the Dominion as provided in the present draft Agreement
and we would provide for this contingent all the equipment
both initial and recurring and other maintenance charges
including pay at R.A.F. rates. The excess of Canadian
over British rates would be borne by Canada as
contemplated in the Agreement as it now stands over
and above the 350,000,000.
We attach the highest importance to the
modification of the plan talcing this form as it has
the effect of not increasing our dollar commitments.
Ends.
