WAR CABINET..
Note by the Prime Minister on War Cabinet Arrangements.
The following Note summarises the revised arrangemeruts
which I explained to my colleagues at Saturday's Meeting of
the War Cabinet, and which met with their general approval.
(I) MEETINGS AT THE WEEK-END.
Until further notice, unless any urgent and important
matter arises, the War Cabinet will not meet on Sunday, and the
Meeting on Saturday will be attended by three Ministers only,
on the rota system at present applied to Sunday Meetings.
The Ministers who, under the.rota system, attend
the Meeting of the War Cabinet on Saturday, will arrange to be
available at short notice over the week-end. It will be a
great convenience if particulars of their whereabouts and
movements over the week-end (including telephone numbers or
other method of communication) are communicated to the War
Cabinet Offices,
I' (II) ARRANGEMENTS FOR MEETINGS DURING THE CHRISTMAS RECESS. '
The arrangements are set out in the annexed Schedule.
As I explained, it is intended, during the Recess, in addition
to the special arrangements for Christmas itself, to make a
somewhat freer use of the rota system of attendance at the
week-ends.
These arrangements, like those under (I), are, of
course, subject to the over-riding consideration that a full
Meeting of the War Cabinet may be summoned at any time, if
this is thought necessary.

The War Rooms of the Service Departments, and the
Offices of the War Cabinet, will be staffed continuouslythrough
out the period.
(III) ARRANGEMENTS OF WAR CABINET BUSINESS.
So far as possible, the business of the War Cabinet
will in future be arranged on the following principle:-
MONDAY, WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY:
These days will normally be devoted to
statements by the Service Ministers and
by the Foreign Secretary, together with
matters appertaining to the Service
Departments or the Foreign Office.
TUESDAY AND THURSDAY:
These days will normally be devoted to
matters relating to the Civil Departments
or to other matters which require ample
time for discussion. Unless there is any
matter of outstanding importance or
urgency, the Service Ministers and the
Foreign Secretary will make no statement,
and the attendance of the Chiefs of Staff
will not normally be necessary.
While this will be the general scheme for the
arrangement of weekly business, it will, no doubt,
have to be modified on occasion, to allow of prompt
consideration of urgent matters.
(IV) INTERVAL BETWEEN THE CIRCULATION OF WAR CABINET PA P E RS
AND THEIR DISCUSSION IN THE WAR CABINET.
At the outbreak of war the rule was suspended
whereby Papers had to be circulated five days before the
Meeting of the Cabinet at which they were considered.

In recent weeks the War Cabinet Secretariat,
v/ithout attempting to work to a definite rule, have adopted
as a general practice that, unless a matter is particularly
urgent, a Paper issued, say, on Monday night, is not put
on the War Cabinet agenda until Wednesday.
It has been represented that this practice, which
allows only one clear day for Ministers to read the Paper
and for a Departmental brief tc be prepared, has resulted
in a good deal of inconvenience. It is therefore proposed
that the normal practice should, in future, be to allow
two clear days to elapse between the circulation of a Paper
and its consideration by the War Cabinet. As in the case of
(III) above, however, this cannot be an inflexible rule,
since otherwise urgent matters would be delayed.
