CALLING UP OF KEN FOR THE ARMED FORCES.
Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.
The National Service (Armed Forces) Act, 1939, provides for male Britia,
subjects between the ages of 18 and 41 to be made liable by Royal Proclamation
to be called up for service in the Armed Forces of the Grown. The present
procedure is to proclaim each successive age-group as required, and at the
same time proclaim those who had reached 20 years of age since the last
Proclamation. Thus men aged 21 and those who had reached the age of 20
since the militiamen were registered last June were made liable for service
by Proclamation on 1st October; and men age^22 and those who had reached 20
since 1st October were made liable for service by Proclamation on 1st December.
The proposal I wish to put to my colleagues is that this system of
successive Proclamations for yearly groups every two to three months should
be discontinued and that in future there should be one Proclamation on
1st January, making liable the age-groups which are expected to be required
for the year. Further age-groups could, if necessary, be proclaimed at any
timea
It is anticipated that the man-power requirements of the Services for 1940
will be satisfied by four age-groups (each of which yields about 170,000 men
for the Services), but to allow a margin it is suggested that five age-groups
should be proclaimed, namely the men aged 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27, as well as
the 19-*20 age-group so as to enable the young men as they reach 20 to be
picked up. It would be made clear that these young men would not be
registered until they had attained the age of 20. Accordingly, the
proposal which I am putting forward is to make liable for service by
Proclamation on 1st January next all men who had reached the age of 19 and
had not reached the age of 28 on that date.
It is not proposed to alter the present system of registering separately
each age-group as required, and accordingly the separate age-groups within
the 19-28 field would be registered at intervals during the year.

The proposal to have one Proclamation on 1st January has considerable
administrative advantages, particularly in tracing persons who have not
registered. This is done by the Registrars-General v/ho check the registrations
under the Armed Forces Act against the national registers. The
present procedure makes this work complicated and laborious, and delay is
inevitable, because if the critical date (i.e. the date of Proclamation) is
not 1st January the entries relating to all persons born in three different
years have to be examined. One Proclamation on 1st January each year would
result in the registration of birth year classes so that in checking rcgistrations
it would only be necessary to look at all persons born in particular
years, with the exception of the limited numbers reaching 20 years of age.
The Registrar-General for England and Wales and the Registrar-General for
Scotland have been consulted, and they are emphatic in their view that a
change-over to a birth year basis would, be of the greatest assistance to them.
The Proclamation of several age-groups on 1st January would also assist
industry, as it would ;warn employers of the fact that they would have to
do without certain of their employees at an early date and that they should
therefore be considering what adjustments may be required.
Politically the proposal has much to commend it. I believe that a
Proclamation on 1st January next making liable for service all men up to 28
would have a profoundly good effect in France and in the neutral countries,
and would also have a stimulating effect in this country. It would come at
a time when it can be expected that the strain of waiting may well be having
some deleterious effect on morale, and action of this kind taken on New-
Year1 s Day, demonstrating our determination and resolve, would, I suggest,
provide a fitting opening for 1940.
The Service Departments have been consulted and do not dissent from
the above proposal, for which I accordingly seek the consent of the War
Cabinet.
