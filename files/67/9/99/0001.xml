DRAFT INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT.Memorandum by Lord Cherwe11.The International Wheat Advisory Committee atWashington, on which this country is    represented, hasmade proposals which it would seem might have unfortunaterepercussions on the war.Wheat growers all over the world are anxious tohave better and more stable prices for wheat after the war.The International Wheat Advisory Gommittee proposes to achieve this by restricting output by agreement in allwheat producing countries.      This appears to be regardedas the first instalment of the reconstructed world order for which we are fighting and Great Britain&apos;s adherence to the compact is represented as a crucial test of oursincerity.It might in present circumstances be wise toagree to some such plan even though it may presage similarproposals about cotton and other raw materials consumed by Ithis country and produced elsewhere.      But there seems tobe one most serious objection which has nothing to do witheconomics, hut arises out of the war situation.The territories which Hitler occupies have an enormous peasant population.      If Goebbels can persuade them that it is our intention, should we win, to forcethem to reduce their crops he will go a long way toconsolidating public opinion against an Anglo-Saxonvictory and in favour of the New Order.Germany asks the peasant to expand the productionof the field, we tell him to restrict it,        Germany offersto buy all he can produce;    we tell him that his cropsmust be supplanted by those from overseas.      Our systemmay redound to his advantage in the long run, hut this first item in the programme will hit his means of livelihood-hood at once,  while the countervailing benefits areproblematic, unspecified and remote.     We should be hardput to it to explain this away to the simple mindedpeasant..It seems important that our negotiators shouldstress this argument which is real&apos; and general ratherthan the damage to British farming, an aspect which willbe attributed to selfish interest and carry little weightin Washington.      The question has hitherto tended to beconsidered in isolation.      The propaganda danger of theprogramme of restriction,  however, is so grave that itshould be considered on the highest level as a majorquestion of policy.      At the very least it would seem weshould endeavour to persuade the Conference to postponeplans for restriction until after the war.Incidentally,  it would seem feasible to devise ascheme to achieve, anyhow in the early years after the war,what the wheat growers really desire without imposingcompulsory restriction.
