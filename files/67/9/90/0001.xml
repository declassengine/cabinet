(THIS DOCUmEM&apos; IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC LAJESTY&apos;secret.W.P.(G)(41) 90.2nd Septeiriber, 1941.RECORDING- OF JOURNEYS BY MOTORISTS HOLDING SU??LEi3MPiiR^PETROL RATTOlS&quot;: :Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.1,     In May last the Lord President&apos;s committee decided that, as one of a number of measures designed tosecure economy in the use of petrol, motorists holdingsupplementary petrol rations should keep a log snowingthe mileage and purpose of their journeys.   It was thought that this would serve (a) to bring it home tomotorists that strict economy must be practised and thatpetrol granted for business purposes must not be used forpleasure driving;   and (b) to help the Petroleum department in assessing more precisely the actual needs of particularapplicants for supplementary rations.The Petroleum Department announced that motoristsreceiving supplementary rations might in future be calledupon to give an account of the purposes for which theserations had been used,, and for that reason would he well advised to keep a log of their journeys.   This warningwas also given in the notices sent to individual motoristswith the new issue of supplementary rations for the months June/July,    Some motorists are now keeping logs,in accordance with this warning;   and in connection withthe issue of further supplementary rations, the PetroleumDepartment have called upon a percentage of applicants toproduce their logs for the preceding period.2.     The present position is, therefore, that thesemotorists have been told, both individually and throughpublic announcements in the Press, that they should keep a log of their journeys.   And the Petroleum department are anmous that these logs should in fact be kept, atany rate by certain classes of motorists holdingsupplementary rations.At present, however, the matter rests solely on &quot;advice&quot; given by the Petroleum Department, and thereis no legal sanction for this &quot;advice&quot;.5.     The Petroleum Department have suggested that itis enough that motorists should know that, if they do notkeep a log, their next application for supplementaryrations may be refused or cut down.COPY NO.51- 1 -

4.     The Lord President&apos;s Committee think this an unsatisfactory arrangement, for the following reasons;-(a) It is dangerous to put into the hands of officials a power to withhold petrol rations on this ground alone&quot;if there is in fact no legal obligation on the motorist to keep a log at all.   A requirement of this kind should have proper authority behind it.(b) Supplementary rations are granted only if thepetrol is to be used for purposes involving some element of public importance - i.e. they are granted not so much for the benefit of the individual but to enable him to dowork which is of some importance from the national pointof view.   To withhold further supplies, not because he hasnot used the petrol for that purpose, but merely because he has failed to keep a log, would penalise the purpose .as well as the motorist.5.     The Committee therefore recommend that the&quot;advice&quot; already given by the Petroleum Department shouldbe given legal authority by the making of an Orderempowering the Minister to direct that specified classesof motorists shall keep specified records of theirjourneys.   The requirement will not be universal, for it will be applied only to certain.classes of motorists,as and when required;   nor onerous, for the particularsto be recorded will not be elaborate.   It may be assumed that the obligation will be generally observed, and thatthe necessity for enforcement by proceedings in the courtswill rarely, if ever, arise.   But the administrative action taken by the Department to induce   these motoriststo keep records will thus be given proper legal authority,and will not be open to challenge on the ground that themotorist is under no legal obligation to comply with the&quot;advice&quot; issued by the Department.6.     The question hitherto at issue has been, notwhether these motorists shall keep these records or not -it has been common ground that the log should be kept -but whether or not the Petroleum Department should obtain proper legal authority for requiring them to keepand produce these records.If the War Cabinet should decide that motoristsshould not have to keep these records, it will benecessary for the Petroleum Department to withdraw the&quot;advice&quot; already given to all motorists holdingsupplementary rations.J.A.GREAT GEORGE STREET, S.W.1.2nd September, 1941.
