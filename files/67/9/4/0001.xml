Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 4.January 9, 1941.WAR CABINET.ENEMY SHIPS SHELTERING IN NEUTRAL PORTS.Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping.IN W.P. (G) (39) 125, the question of enemy ships in neutral ports was brought to the notice of the War Cabinet a year ago.2. The United States Government have indicated that they are studyingmethods of taking over enemy ships sheltering in their ports, together withDanish and French ships, with a view to making them, or a large proportion ofthem or their equivalent in other tonnage, available for our use. They wish todeal first with Danish ships as presenting less political difficulty. Forty out ofeighty-three enemy ships in United States ports are under the Danish flag. ;  .3. Attempts on the part of other countries or interests to take over enemy vessels for use have hitherto been prevented by our insistence on our right ofcapture. Our previous negotiations with representatives of Danish owners aboutDanish ships sheltering in neutral ports have been based on the requirement thatthe ships must submit to capture and transfer to the British flag. It would be highly undesirable that the U.S. Government should now offer more favourable conditions to -the Danish owners who have refused our terms than we have arranged with the others.4. The difference between negotiations with the United States and any previous proposals is that we are dealing with a benevolent Government whose main interest in the matter is to provide us with tonnage.5.   The main difficulties to be overcome are : (a) requisitioning is ordinarily a belligerenfs right and limited to the seizure of what is required for the urgent needs of the country exercising theright;(b) the Neutrality Act prevents ships, if under the United States flag, fromtrading to belligerent zones;(c) there is an obligation to pay compensation, and payments, even if intoa blocked account, might serve as a basis of credit for the enemy;(d) the present crews need to be disposed of and to be replaced.6. The most favourable course for us would be that the U.S. Governmentshould requisition (whether under their existing law or an amendment of it)and then transfer to us for registry under the British flag on hire basis, under&quot;bare boat&quot; terms. It is not known what powers the American Governmentmay possess or be willing to take, but it may prove that any practicable coursewill require us to accept some compromise either on our right to capture enemy vessels or on the denial of financial benefit to the enemy. I propose to explorewith the United States a scheme which safeguards so far as possible these points,but which would secure for us a large addition to our tonnage. This latterconsideration must be paramount in present circumstances. If we only forgoour right of capture in return for an adequate qtiid pro quo, our essentialprinciple will not be sacrificed.[22111]

Other countries, particularly in South America, are showing interestand I propose to explore possibilities with them also, but if possible to completea scheme with the United States first which is likely to be the most advantageousand may serve as a model.S.   Particulars of the enemy ships sheltering in neutral ports are appended.9. I seek authority to continue negotiations with the United States in orderto evolve a practicable scheme.E. H.
