THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECEET. Copy No.    QA.W.P. (G) (41) 107.October 3, 1941.twAR CABINET.DRAFT INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AT their meeting on the 25th September, the War Cabinet considered theposition of the negotiations at the meeting of the International Advisory Com-mittee at Washington, and asked that the revised instructions to our delegates should be submitted to them (W.M. (41), 97th Conclusions, Minute 9).Revised instructions have now been drawn up; but these are necessarily longand detailed, and I do not think I need trouble my colleagues to read more thanthe attached copy of the covering note which itself summarises the full text ofthe instructions [Annex I].2. This summary has been considered by the Lord Presidents Committeeon the basis that we intend to proceed with the negotiation of a Wheat Agreementindependently of the wider issues of post-war economic policy. On that basis,the Committee are agreed that the attached document, which incorporates certain amendments made by them, correctly indicates the attitude which our delegates should adopt on the resumption of negotiations.3. The Committee desire, however, to submit, for consideration by the WarCabinet as a major issue of policy, the question whether these negotiationsregarding a particular commodity should be pressed to a conclusion in advanceof discussions regarding Anglo-American collaboration in post-war economic problems as a whole.These proposals for an international Wheat Agreement first arose out of the assurance, given by the Prime Minister in August 1940, that steps would be takenin the immediate post-war period to assure food supplies for the stricken countries of Europe. It was not thought possible that such relief supplies could be financeddirectly by His Majesty&apos;s Government; and, as a result, Ministers agreed that weshould aim at United States&apos; co-operation in securing schemes for regulation of marketing and stockholding of the principal commodities. Wheat was the mostimportant of these and at the joint request of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in theUnited Kingdom and Canada the United States Administration convened thepresent Wheat Conference.4.   Since the negotiations began, however, the situation has undergone a material change.The Atlantic Charter has established the general principle of Anglo-American collaboration in seeking a settlement of post-war economic problems.In connection with the question of &quot; Lease-lend consideration,&quot; Lord Halifax hasbeen authorised to propose the opening of discussions on these general issues see Annex II.Further, the entry of Russia into the war and the consequent change in therelations between the U.S.S.R. and the United States materially affects the back- ,ground against which the proposed Wheat Agreement must be viewed.   It is[22983] &apos; B
necessary to consider how far the U.S.S.R., as a large producer of wheat,; shouldbe brought into the discussion of a Wheat Agreement at an early, stage of thenegotiations.5. In these circumstances the Committee suggest that the War cabinet should now consider whether we should go forward with an attempt to concludean Agreement dealing separately with the single problem of wheat, or whether we should seek to persuade the Americans that negotiations for a Wheat Agree-ment should stand over until further progress has been made in settling the general lines of Anglo-American collaboration over the whole field of post-war economic problems.If it be decided to suggest postponement of the Wheat negotiations, it willbe necessary to do all we can to secure that our action is not misrepresented in theUnited States. For this reason, it might be desirable that the Prime minister should make a personal approach to the President.J. A.Great George Street, S.W.1,October 3, 1941.
Summary of Revised Instructions for the United Kingdom Delegation.General Policy and Procedure.1.* The general purpose of the Draft Wheat Agreement is the organisationof the world wheat market so as (a) To ensure adequate nutrition and better standards of life for the peoples;and(6) Thereby to promote stable prices and assured markets for the exporting countries.2. To these objectives, in their broad form, the United Kingdom Govern-ment wholeheartedly subscribe. They recognise that these objectives imply are organisation of world agriculture, in which each producing and consumingcountry must co-operate. The methods, however, by which these objectives are tobe attained raise a number of important questions some affecting the interestsof the United Kingdom itself, and some relating to the positibn of european countries who are not represented at the present discussions. While the UnitedKingdom Government are ready to co-operate in framing and operating aninternational Wheat Agreement of a fair and satisfactory character, they feel bound to press for numerous and important alterations in the proposalsformulated in the draft Agreement.3. It may well be that the delegations of some of the exporting countries will be most reluctant to agree to such drastic changes in the scheme : and it will be important therefore to make clear the general considerations, which, in the view ofthe United Kingdom Government, make them necessary. The arguments by which each of the particular amendments is justified are set out hereinafter in connexionwith each amendment; but behind these detailed arguments there Hes a difference of view as to the appropriate method of approach to the problem as a whole,which it is important to make clear.4. The United Kingdom Government are convinced that the attempt to formulate a comprehensive scheme, designed to embrace all wheat importing and wheat exporting countries, is one that can only be wisely undertaken when thosecountries are more fully represented than is possible at the present time. this applies more particularly to the obligations of the importing countries.5. The Draft Agreement contemplates placing upon the importing countries  series of obligations to which there is no parallel in other commodity regulationschemes.  They are required (i) To restrict their own wheat production to&quot; the average of the years1922/29 (Article II (3) ).(ii) To restrict their domestic price of wheat to a level which is not to exceedby more than one-third the equivalent of the standard price&quot; of wheatfixed by the Council (Article VI (1)).(iii) To abolish milling regulations requiring the admixture of Other cerealsin flour (Article VI (2) ).(iv) To police the agreed export quotas, and the allowances determined bythe Council for non-signatory exporting countries (Article IV&quot;(10) (It)).(v) To police the observation of the price-fixing provisions (Article V (5)).and possibly(vi) To under take to purchase from the Wheat Union all wheat imported into their territories as proposed in the Supplementary Agreement.6. These obligations&apos; obviously raise extremely controversial issues : many ofthem, as is indicated! in the detailed comments, appear to the United Kingdom1Government to be unreasonable on merits, at any rate in respect of form and ofdegree. But the essential point is that it appears- to the&quot; United Kingdom government -ment unwise to prescribe obligations of such a detailed and far-reaching character
at a Conference at which the United Kingdom is the only importing country.Even if the obligations in question appeared to the United Kingdom to beintrinsically reasonable, it could not be assumed that the importing countries ofEurope would take the same view. It is most unlikely that they would willinglysubscribe to obligations in the formulation of which they had not been consulted,particularly as the scheme offers little to the importing countries by way of com-pensation, apart from the prospect of obtaining wheat from the Relief Pool afterthe war and the doubtful advantage which they would derive from the assurance of adequate supplies of wheat at the prices contemplated in the Agreement. Inthe view of the United Kingdom Government, the first condition of securing theco-operation of European importing countries in a wheat agreement is that theobligations for all of them should be the subject of free and unfettered negotia-tions with them. For this purpose, it seems essential to avoid any cut-and-driedprovisions concerning importing countries until the majority of them can bebrought into the negotiations.7. The Draft Agreement, on the contrary, appears to be framed on theassumption that the provision of a pool for post-war relief makes it legitimateand desirable to press European importing countries to accept obligations whichhave been drawn up without their collaboration. This idea receives explicitexpression in the letter from the United States Ambassador, dated the17th September : -&quot; It is, of course, in the interest of the wheat-exporting countries thatEuropean wheat-importing countries should learn as soon as possible of thenew policy which they will at the appropriate time be pressed to adopt. Itis before, and not after, their urgent post-war needs have been relieved thatthey should appreciate the necessity of international collaboration in working out an effective solution of the world wheat problem.&quot;This point of view appears to the United Kingdom Government to havedangerous implications, particularly at the present critical stage of the war. Itwould violate the first principle of free international relations and might be welcome material for the enemy propaganda machine. In fact, the proposal now put forward is not one for &quot; international collaboration in working out an effective solution of the world wheat problem&quot;; it is to frame an agreementwithout any consultation with the European Governments, and to force it upon them by pressure of relief needs. To attempt to dragoon European countriesinto an international agreement by the threat of withholding relief supplies would, in our view, be both inexpedient and in the long run ineffective.8. It is important to convince the United States Government on this point.There may even be a. risk that, if the United States and the other exporting countries find that we are not prepared to support them in enforcing their proposed conditions, they may withdraw their participation in the proposedRelief Pool. This would be very unfortunate, as it would leave His Majesty&apos;sGovernment the full responsibility, as regards wheat, for implementing thePrime Minister&apos;s policy that food should be available to Europe as soon as it isliberated from Nazi aggression. The United Kingdom Delegation must there-fore make it clear that we are entirely in favour of securing a reduction in the excessive protectionism practised in Europe before the war, but we believe thatit cannot be attained by linking the offer of wheat to European countries withpressure to modify their economic policies, and that the best course is to providethe wheat pool and to negotiate agreements in regard to future economic policies as a separate issue.9. In short, the European countries must be persuaded that it is in their real interests and also within their powers to adopt the reforms contemplated.The Covering Note prefixed to the Draft Agreement contemplates that the five powers now negotiating it &quot;will desire to use their economic resources and influence to assist the reorganisation of European agriculture.&quot; It appears tothe United Kingdom Government that this method of approach is much more likely to be effective in securing the desired readjustments of European wheatproduction, but raises questions which presumably go beyond the competence ofthe Wheat Conference.   The importing countries will, however, certainly desire
some further elucidation of the intentions of the exporting countries on thispoint. They will also presumably need to have a clear idea as to the prospect oftheir being able to pay for increased imports of wheat.10. The United States Ambassador, however, also refers to &quot; the far-reaching importance attached by my Government to the conclusion of a satis-factory wheat agreement.&quot; The United Kingdom Government can fully endorsethis statement: the issue attaches to the interpretation of the word &apos;&apos; satis-factory,&quot; and to the method by which an Agreement is to be brought about. Inview of the paramount importance of good relations with the United States andthe Dominion Governments at the present juncture, the United Kingdom Govern-ment wish to make every effort to reconcile the difference of point of view and tosecure an agreement which will obtain the general adherence of both exportingand importing countries and which will prove workable when brought intooperation.11. There is reason to believe that the United States Government will be willing to go a considerable way towards meeting the view of the UnitedKingdom Government, as they are known to regard the present draft of theAgreement as provisional. The United States officials with whom Sir frederick leith-Ross held informal discussions expressed the view that they would expectreservations to the Agreement to be made by individual countries upon signing.The United States Government will recognise that the accession to an agreement by the United Kingdom Government is of great importance to its chance ofsuccess. There is also reason to believe that Australia and Canada will welcomea more temperate document, and that Argentina has doubts about the possibilityof implementing certain of the obligations. The Wheat Agreement of 1933 afar less ambitious scheme broke down following Argentina&apos;s inability to implement its terms.12. Provided the draft Agreement can be revised to meet the views of theUnited Kingdom Government, the question of signature will arise. For thereasons given above, it appears to the United Kingdom Government highly desirable that other European Governments should be approached for their views before the draft Agreement is finally settled. From some points of view it wouldbe most satisfactory if the Agreement were limited to the provisions about quotas.Relief Pool, &amp;c, which the exporting countries can immediately implement, anda draft prepared covering the obligations of importing countries which wouldnot be signed until other importing countries can be brought into the discussions.This procedure would, however, give rise to great difficulties as the importing countries would then not be entitled to any voice in the administration of thescheme for the time being, and the fixing of prices, in which the importing countries are most directly concerned, would be left in the hands of the exporting countries.13. The most practical procedure would appear to be that the conference should proceed (1) To agree a draft acceptable to the five Powers now represented.(2) On completion of this, to decide whether it is politically practicable to approach other countries such as Russia, possibly Holland, &amp;c, and,if so, to conclude an Agreement among as many countries as may be practicable.(3) Failing the practicability of securing the immediate adherence of anyother countries, to have the Agreement signed by the five Powers nowrepresented. In that event the Agreement should not contain any limitation of United Kingdom production or acreage. (See para-graph 19 (a).)14. The United Kingdom Delegation should send to London regularly anytexts of Articles as they emerge from the discussions so that we can follow theproceedings. In any case, the full revised text would require to be sent to london for final approval by the Cabinet before it can be signed by the United kingdom delegation.[22983] c
Nature of the Chief Modifications of the Draft A greement to be proposed by theUnited Kingdom.16. The principal modifications in the Draft Agreement for which theUnited Kingdom Delegation should press, and the suggestions which they are authorised to make, are in the following paragraphs  17. Price. The provisions as regards price need to be i^ecast. The methodof price determination by reference to an index number of general prices is inprinciple unsound, and would prove impracticable. The objective of a price&apos;&apos; fair to consumers and remunerative to producers&apos;&apos; is acceptable: the determination of such a price by the Council is acceptable : but it should notbe a rigid price and it can only be settled empirically, having regard to all the prevailing circumstances. The price so determined is to be no more than a target&quot; price. The method of establishing and maintaining it within areasonable range of variation, whether by adjustments of export quotas or other arrangements, would require to be worked out in further technical discussions.Sanctions, as applied to price, could not be accepted as an obligation by theUnited Kingdom.15. The main features of the draft Agreement in its present form are asfollows : (a) Fair Price. The Wheat Council (consisting of representatives of the signatory Powers) is to determine the standard price of wheat in international trade. This price is to be calculated by reference to theBoard of Trade index of general prices, so as to maintain the priceof wheat, in relation to general prices, at a level &quot; fair to consumersand remunerative to producers.&quot; Supply and demand are to be adapted to price so determined by a system of direct and indirectgovernmental controls.(b) Government Controls and Sanctions. These include regulation of pro-duction both in exporting and importing countries, reinforced by asystem of agreed proportional export quotas and holding of stocks(and allowances for non-signatory countries) and further reinforced by a system of &quot;sanctions.&quot; The &quot;sanctions&quot; take the form of mandatory obligations upon both exporting and importing countriesin respect of quotas from signatory countries, and non-mandatoryobligations upon exporting countries in respect of allowances to non-signatory countries. The controls extend to measures for policingprice, mandatory upon exporting countries and, if invited by theCouncil, upon importing countries.(c) Expansion of Wheat Exports. Exports of wheat from overseas countries are to be expanded as the result of an obligation upon importing countries to take measures to reduce domestic wheat production tothe level of 1922/29. Importing countries are also required to reducethe price of wheat to their consumers and for this purpose to revisetariffs, import quotas or milling regulations. Policies of subsidy to domestic farmers are not condemned, so long as the price to consumersin importing countries is not forced up unduly. The exporting countries are obliged to take measures to reduce their production tothe amount required under the provisions of the Agreement regardingexport quotas and minimum and maximum stocks.(d) Relief Pool and Wheat Union. A pool of wheat is to be contributed by the Governments of the signatory countries to be made availablefree for post-war relief and to be administered under the authority ofthe Council by a Union to be established.(e) A Memorandum of a possible supplementary A greement is attached tothe main Draft Agreement suggesting various schemes whereby theWheat Union might be developed into a world monopoly controlling the international trade in wheat of the signatory countries.
18. Governmental Controls and Sanctions (excluding sanctions as regardsprice just mentioned) : (a) Sanctions with regard to export quotas. In order to bring about ageneral agreement, the United Kingdom Government would beprepared to &quot;police&quot; export quotas subject to certain safeguards.This undertaking goes beyond any provision included in existingcommodity schemes and represents a major concession.(b) Sanctions with regard to export allowances. The United KingdomGovernment are prepared to give &apos;&apos; their best&apos;&apos; consideration to any suggestion made by the Council but are not prepared to accept an unconditional commitment.(c) Relation to other Agreements. The United Kingdom Government areprepared to do their best to secure the revision of any CommercialAgreements which contain provisions incompatible with the&quot;policing&quot; of quotas, but they cannot undertake to denounceincompatible agreements if their revision cannot be secured by friendlynegotiation.19.   Expansion of Wheat Exports.(a) Restriction of Production in importing cotintries. The United KingdomGovernment could not endorse the present provisions. They feel thatthe Agreement should confine itself to providing that the question should be taken up by the Council with individual Governments. TheUnited Kingdom Government are prepared to accept a provision inthe Agreement establishing the principle of limitation (whether ofacrsage or of production) as part of, and in order to bring about ageneral Agreement. The figure of such limitation should be settled at a later stage, and should await the outcome of the discussions which it is hoped will shortly be initiated with the U.S.S.R. and theDutch. In accepting the principle of limitation, nothing must be said by our delegates, even in private discussion, which would imply thatthis limitation would be a limitation below pre-war acreage.(b) Import Restrictions and Consumption. The United Kingdom Govern-ment would accept a text setting out the principles of the present article, but leaving the Council to negotiate with the Governmentsconcerned the steps by which these principles should be carried intoeffect.20. Relief Pool. The United Kingdom Government are prepared tocontribute 25 million bushels, to be delivered f.o.b. the producing country. they propose that the functions of the Union should be amended so as to secureco-ordination with any arrangements made for the establishment of a generalrelief organisation. They are prepared to offer, outside the Agreement, to make advances of wheat available from United Kingdom stocks for immediate post-wardelivery to Europe if required, subject to these stocks being replaced later fromthe Relief Pool.21. Possible Supplementary Agreements. The United Kingdom Govern-ment await further elucidation of these schemes. As they understand theproposals, they believe that it would be premature to attempt to give effect to them until it can be foreseen whether the system of monopoly selling is acceptable tothe exporting countries : whether the system of governmental bulk purchase islikely to continue in the United Kingdom; to what extent a free cereals marketis to be restored or maintained; and so far as European countries are concerned,until the views of those countries can be ascertained.Both in connection with the Supplementary Agreement and with arrange-ments for controlling prices, the question of constituting buffer stocks may beraised. The constitution.of a buffer stock in United Kingdom by the UnitedKingdom Government or by the United Kingdom Government and the WheatUnion jointly is a matter which we would be prepared to explore, but no proposal on the subject involving any commitment on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment can be put forward by the United Kingdom Delegation at this stage. Ifthe Delegation think it necessary to raise this point, they should refer back for instructions. . ..   .
22. Apart from the above points, the United Kingdom Government would feel bound to press for the inclusion in the Agreement of provisions in thefollowing sense, or to make reservations on them : (a) The implementation of the provisions of the Agreement under whichimporting countries may be required to restrict imports of wheat fromparticular countries must be dependent on the possibilities of paymentopen to each importing country.(6) The date from which the Agreement should take effect so far as itconcerns United Kingdom obligations must be fixed with the agree-ment of the United Kingdom, and in any case this date could not bebefore the cessation of hostilities,(c) The scheme for voting on the Council should be revised so as to give dueweight to the views of both importing and exporting countries in allmajor decisions and to the views of each group of countries in decisions which primarily affect either respectively.23. The United Kingdom Government hope that modifications of the draft agreement on the above lines will conduce to the completion of a generally acceptable and workable Wheat Agreement. The attached Memorandum contains a reasoned statement of the considerations which arise on the various provisionsof the draft agreement and of the suggestions which the United kingdom delegation are authorised to put forward. It will be for Sir A. Salter to decide how these considerations and suggestions can best be presented, and whether,and at what stage, the revised texts appended can usefully be submitted to theConference. The delegates should not put forward alternative suggestions not within the scope of the instructions, or agree to anything contrary to them without seeking further authority from home.ANNEX II.Consideration under the Lease-Lend Act.Negotiations with the United States Government.SECTION 3 (b) of the Lend-Lease Act provides as follows :  &quot; The terms and conditions upon which any such foreign Governmentreceives any aid authorized under sub-section (a) shall be those which thePresident deems satisfactory, and the benefit to the United States may bepayment or repayment in kind or property or any other direct or indirectbenefit which the President deems satisfactory.&quot;On the 13th June the President intimated to Congress that work had started to fix the terms and conditions under Section 3 (&amp;) upon which foreign Govern-ments would receive aid. Subsequent to that date there were several conversa-tions between Mr. Dean Acheson (of the United States State Department) andMr. Keynes, and the Ambassador and Mr. Keynes had a discussion with thePresident. In the light of these discussions the Prime Minister and thePresident were both decidedly of the opinion that no attempt should be made atthis stage to determine in detail what form of &quot; consideration &quot; should be asked by the United States and. accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and instructionsto this effect were given on both sides. The eventual outcome of the conversationswas the presentation by Mr. Acheson to Mr. Keynes of the attached draft Agree-ment [Enclosure I], which was brought back by Mr. Keynes when he returnedto this country.The only part of the American draft which gives jise to serious difficulty isArticle VII; various drafting points arise on the other Articles, but these areof no importance. It will be seen, however, that Article VII of the draft, likethe earlier drafts of the Atlantic Declaration, raises acutely the question ofImperial Preference and (less obviously) the question of the extent to which weshall be able to dispense with Exchange Control and abolish trading restrictionsof various kinds when the war comes to an end.
-d   Hta Sfh!af ?af fee fore returned to Washington with an alter:British draft of Article VII as approved by the Prime Minister [Enclosure IIIIt is hoped that this draft, which is consistent with the corresponding passagesm the Atlantic Declaration, will meet the American point of view while safeguarding our own position.   Lord Halifax will, before the matter comes beforethe Cabinet, seek the views of the United States Government on this draft by an informal approach to the State Department.   A draft of an explanatory letter which he will send to Mr. Acheson is attached [Enclosure III].Enclosure I.Draft handed by Mr. Dean Acheson to Mr. Keynes, July 28, 1941.WHEREAS the United States of America and the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland declare that, with self-restraint and sober-purpose,they are engaged in a co-operative undertaking, together with every other nationor people of like mind, to the end of laying the bases of a just and enduring world peace securing order under law to themselves and all nations;And whereas the President of the United States of America has determined,pursuant to the Act of Congress of the 11th March, 1941, that the defense of theUnited Kingdom against aggression is vital to the defense of the United Statesof America;And whereas the United States of America has extended and is continuing to extend to the United Kingdom aid in resisting aggression;And whereas the final determination of the terms and conditions upon whichthe United Kingdom receives such aid and of the benefits to be received by theUnited States of America in return therefor should be deferred until the extentof the defense aid is known and until the progress of events makes clearer thefinal terms and conditions and benefits which will be in the mutual interests ofthe United States of America and the United Kingdom and will promote theestablishment and maintenance of world peace;And whereas the Governments of the United States of America and theUnited Kingdom are mutually desirous of concluding now a preliminary agree-ment in regard to the providing of defense aid and in regard to certain considera-tions which shall be taken into account in determining such terms and conditions,and the making of such an agreement has been in all respects duly authorised,and all acts, conditions and formalities which it may have been necessary to perform, fulfil or execute prior to the making of such an agreement in conformitywith the laws either of the United States of America or of the United kingdom have been performed, fulfilled or executed as required;The undersigned, being duly authorised for that purpose, have agreed asfollows : Article I.The United States of America will continue to supply the United kingdom with such defense articles, defense services, and defense information as thePresident shall authorise to be transferred or provided.Article II.The United Kingdom will continue to contribute to the defense of the UnitedStates of America and the strengthening thereof and, should circumstances arise in which the United States of America in its owjq defense or the defense of the americas may require articles, services, or information, wall provide such articles,services, or information as it may be in a position to supply.Article III.The Government of the United Kingdom will not without the consent of thePresident transfer title to, or possession of, any defense article or defenseinformation transferred to it under the Act or permit the use thereof by anyonenot an officer, employee or agent of the Government of the United Kingdom.[22983] D
Article IV.If, as a result of the transfer to the Government of the United Kingdom ofany defense article or defense information, it becomes necessary for that Goyern-ment to take any action or make any payment in order fully to protect any of therights of a citizen of the United States of America who has patent rights in andto any such defense article or information, the Government of the UnitedKingdom will take such action or make such payment when requested to do so bythe President.Article V.The Government of the United Kingdom will return to the United Statesof America at the end of the present emergency, as determined&quot; by the President,such defense articles transferred under this Agreement as shall not have been destroyed, lost or consumed and as shall be determined by the President to be useful in the defense of the United States of America or of the western hemisphere or to be otherwise of use to the United States of America.Article VI.In the final determination of the benefits to be provided to the United Statesof America full cognizance shall be taken of all property, services, information,facilities, or other benefits or considerations provided by the Government of theUnited Kingdom subsequent to the 11th March,&apos; 1941, and accepted oracknowledged by the President on behalf of the United States of America.Article VII.The terms and conditions upon which the United Kingdom receives defenseaid from the United States of America and the benefits to be received by theUnited States of America in return therefor, as finally determined, shall be suchas not to burden commerce between the two countries but to promote mutuallyadvantageous economic relations between them and the betterment of world-wideeconomic relations; they shall provide against discrimination in either the UnitedStates of America or the United Kingdom against the importation of any produceoriginating in the other country; and they shall provide for the formulation of measures for the achievement of these ends.Article VIII.This Agreement shall continue in force from the date on which it is signeduntil a date agreed upon by the two Governments.Signed and sealed at Washington in duplicate this day of, 1941.On behalf of the United States of America :(Title)On behalf of the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland :(Title)
Enclosure III.Draft Letter for Lord Halifax to accompany the A mendments proposed to the&quot;Consideration&quot; Proposals.Dear Mr. Acheson,MY Government have taken advantage of my presence in London to instructme in the light of careful thought which they have given to the draft proposals under Section 3 (b) of the Lend-Lease Act which you handed to Mr. Keynes onthe 28th July, 1941.2. They are very sensible of the generosity of the terms of these proposals,and are anxious to accept them in spirit and in substance with the least possibleamendment of the form of words proposed. They are no less keenly alive tothe magnitude of the question, and are most anxious to respond to the broadmanner in which the United States Government have invited their collaboration.3. They are, therefore, glad to say that apart from some verbal changes ofno significance which are set out in a separate paper, no question arises exceptin regard to Article VII. My Government believe that their intentions and theirhopes for the economic organisation of the post-war world are closely in line withthose of the President. They have found that it is not easy to refer to these inprecise terms until the two Governments have defined them in their own minds inmore detail than is yet possible. Meanwhile, His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious in all candour not to subscribe to phrases which might be interpretedhereafter in more than one sense. They also think it better, and in this they feel sure the President will agree, to emphasise that what both Governments have inview is part of a general plan and that the escape from restrictions on one sidewill only be practicable by their relaxation on all sides. &apos;4. My Government suggest, therefore, below, a form of words which betterserves so they feel the common desire to collaborate. And since, admittedlyand inevitably, the bare words themselves carry insufficient content with them,they have added a clause, which is I think in conformity with a suggestion youmade to Mr. Keynes and which will, my Government hope, commend itself to thePresident, providing for the initiation of conversations at an early date with aview to giving substance and clarity to the preceding phrases.5. The Departments chiefly concerned are now at work trying to clear up their own minds, which is none too easy when we know so little about the sort of world we shall have to deal with when the struggle is over; and to prepareconcrete proposals. Progress is not so rapid as it would be if our time were lesstaken up with more immediate preoccupations. But we should be glad to make a start as early as may be found mutually convenient in company with those whomthe President may designate to represent him with a view to formulating measures for the achievement of the ends which both Governments have in mind.Enclosure II.Article VII (British Draft).THE terms and conditions upon which the Government of the UnitedKingdom receives defence aid from the Government of the United States ofAmerica and the benefits to be received by the United States of America in returntherefor, as finally determined, shall be such as not to burden commerce betweenthe two countries, but to promote mutually advantageous economic relationsbetween them; they shall provide for joint and agreed action by the UnitedStates and United Kingdom, each working within the limits of their governingeconomic conditions, directed to securing as part of a general plan the progres-sive attainment of balanced international economies, the avoidance of harmfuldiscriminations, and generally the economic objectives set forth in the joint declaration made by the President of the United States of America and the PrimeMinister of the United Kingdom on the 12th August, 1941.And furthermore it is agreed that at an early convenient date conversations should be begun between the two Governments with a view to discussing the best means of attaining the above objects and generally the better ordering of economicintercourse between nations in future conditions of settled peace.
