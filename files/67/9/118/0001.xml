SECRET.W.P. (G) (11) 118.October 27, 1941.WAR CABINET.SHORTAGE OF FEMALE LABOUR FOR MUNITION FACTORIES.Memorandum by Minister of Supply.I AM alarmed at the shortage of female labour in munitions factories,particularly in the filling factories. At four of the largest filling factories,Chorley, Risley, Kirkby and Swynnerton, recruitment of female labour has beenunsatisfactory; in the cases of Chorley, Risley and Swynnerton the fall duringthe present month is startling.Filling Factories.Female Intake as against Demand.Factory.	Demand made on Ministry of Labour.	Intake.						Week ending Sept. 20.	Week ending Sept. 27.	Week ending Oct. 4.	Week ending Oct. 11.	Week-ending Oct. 18.Chorley Risley... Kirkby          ......... Swynnerton  ....	700 per week 700 per week 600 per week 700 per week	613 669 259 250	329 283 217 144	233 236 255 344	227 210 366 286	185 176 296 180To meet current demands and to make up for this shortfall we require atleast 10,000 women for the Royal Ordnance Factories immediately, as well as another 10,000 for firms working for this Ministry in Birmingham and the BlackCountry.At present this Ministry is not allowed to advertise for labour like the service departments. These Departments advertise in the Press. For example, advertise-ments have appeared for the A.T.S., for the R.A.F., the Royal Marines, duringthis month.   We have pressed our claims to the fullest possible extent-.The only solution we can suggest is that this Ministry should be permitted to advertise on the same lines as the Service Departments, and approval is requested.Care will be taken to see that labour is not diverted from other munitions work. Those who answer the advertisements will be employed through the labour exchanges.B.[23064]Copy No.    70THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.
