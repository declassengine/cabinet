S E 0 RE T --f7p\7I^4lT.156oT.fith December. 1941.COPY no war CABINET.HOME      GUARD.Memorandum by the Lord. Privy Seal.1, Subsequent to the Meeting of the ^ar cabinet this  evening (W.M. (41) 129) , the Secretary of State forWar represented, to me that the Home Guard would greatlyresent a procedure whereby members who wished to resignfrom that force when it was  converted from a voluntaryto a compulsory basis, were called upon to state their case before a. civil Appeal Tribunal.    It was strongly urged that members of a military organisation should have their cases heard and decided by a military authority.2. After some discussion, an alternative procedurehas been suggested.. The Secretary of State for War might put the ease to the House in the following way:-&quot;We have fount? it necessary,  as part ofthe scheme for imposing a general obligationfor compulsory national service,  to.organise the Home Guard in future on   a  compulsory,instead of a voluntary, basis, and. we must therefore withdraw/ the right to resign ongiving a fortnight&apos;s notice.We have no doubt&apos; that this  change willgenerally be approved by members of the home guard.    But we wish to    give those personswho joined the Home Guard voluntarily anopportunity of stating their case, if they so wish, before a competent body, at thetime that this change is made, if they feelthat they have good grounds for resigning.It would be Inappropriate that membersof the Home Guard, being a military organisa-tion, should state their case before a civilTribunal.    Nevertheless, the grounds on whichclaims are made to resign will be predominantlycivil grounds.   We propose,    therefore, toget over the difficulty by giving members ofthe Howe Guard who wish to apply to leavethe Home Guard at this juncture, the rightto resign.    This right does not exempt them from the obligation,.if called upon, to perform any part-time service   to which theymay be directed by the Minister of Labour,whether in .the Home Goard or in Civil Defence;but it woulo1 enable them to have their easesheard and decided by a&apos; civil HardshipTribunal.&quot;

56     Under this scheme the right to resign isgiven to members of the Home Guard only in order thatthey may have their cases heard by a Civil TribunalsThe Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityproposes that part-time Civil Defence personnel shouldhave this right.,     There would not therefore seemreason to apprehend, that the treatment proposed for theHoue Guard rould lead the Civil Defence personnelecrcr &apos; - -a pi: &apos;j forward a demand for a right to resigruThep.&apos;  hro&apos; 2,0ty however, been an opportunity fordiscussion of this point with the Home Secretary.4.      At this evening&apos;s Meeting of the War cabinet it was proposed that compulsory service in the home guard, should be applied only to persons within the age limits of compulsory national service in the armed forces of the Crown, i,.e.  18-51.50      It is unnecessary to adhere to these limitssince the National Service Act ( No0  2) gives power to direct to part-time service in the armed forces of theCrown without limits of age.60      It Is thought, however,.that while the lowerage limit of 18 should be&apos;retained for compulsory service in the Home Guard, there would be advantage inmaking the. upper age limit, say, 56,  in order to givethe Minister of Labour and National Service a wider field of selection, and to avoid the suggestion that-elderly men were being conscripted for militaryservice.7.      Existing members of the Home Guard over 56 andunder 65, if they do not exercise the option ofresigning, will continue to serve in the Home,Guard asvolunteers, but with&apos;the full obligation to performtraining and duties, until reaching the age of 65,unless previously discharged,- 8,     Persons compulsorily enroled in the home guard in future will not be discharged on reaching theage of 56, but will be retained in the service untilreaching the age of 65, subject to the power ofcompassionate discharge being freely granted to those over the age of 56*Co S0 As
