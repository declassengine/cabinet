TO BE KEPT UN DER, LOOK AND KEY,. - W is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.TyiHTTMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAIN. IC MAJgSTY1 S GOVERNMENT. )COPY NO,     fWAR CABINET^ADMINISTRATION OP OCCUPIED EHEIYTERRITORIES I IT AaRICA.Report by the -Lord Privy Seal.In response to a request by the Prime Minister, Ipresided over a Meeting of Ministers to examine theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for War on theAdministration of Occupied Enemy Territories in africa (W. P. (G) (41) 20),2.     We are all agreed that one Department should beresponsible for the administration of the occupied territories, and that the War Office is the rightDepartment to undertake the task.      The Foreign office is not suitably organised to direct an administration,and if the Colonial Office were put in charge of anyof the enemy territories, we should be suspected of seeking to incorporate them in our Empire.3,     At the outset, the administration of british somali land must be on the same footing as that of theItalian territories taken over.      As soon as the exigencies of the military situation will permit,its civil administration should be re-established underthe Colonial Office, so as to emphasize the differentstatus of the country from the surrounding enemy territory.4.      The War Office will need the active help andco-operation of several other Government Departments,The most effective way in which this can be givenremains to be worked out in detailo      It was consideredthe Standing Interdepartmental Committee&quot;, on the linesof the Far Eastern:. -Committee, with a junior minister from the War Office in the Chair, would be of greathelp to the War Office, and would save much correspondence,5,     T^e Union of South Africa is interested in thisquestion, and although we have no grounds for supposing that General Smuts would disagree with these proposals,we suggest that he should be told of them, and hiscomments invited.(Intld)    G.R.A.-Great George Street, S.W.1,19TH FEBRUARY, 1941,SB C R a T.W,P.(G)(41)21,19TH FEBRUARY,. 1941.
