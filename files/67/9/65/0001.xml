Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (41) (G) 65.July 10, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR  CABINET.LETTERS FROM M. REYNAUD TO MARSHAL PETAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, translations of twoletters addressed by M. Paul Reynaud to Marshal Petain which were communi-cated confidentially to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington by the state department.A. E.Foreign Office, July 10, 1941.(Translation.)(Confidential communication.)Mr. Marshal, Vals, April 5, 1941.IT was already known that you imprisoned me for having refused, last June,to capitulate and conclude an armistice which I deemed incompatible with Frenchhonour and interest.But what will not fail to cause surprise is that, after imprisoning me, seven months later you caused me to be assailed by all the national broadcasting stations in connection with a polemic with General de Gaulle.I should not even have thought that I ought to protest if this campaign,which, they say, you are going to give the support of your voice, were not based,in the part concerning me, on a series of allegations contrary to truth.Here are a few examples : 1. It is inexact that it is the British Government which asked that weprosecute the war in North Africa. You know better than anyone, because youattended the meetings which were held every morning in my office, that thisdecision had been made by me. It flowed from the engagement contracted by theAllies of not abandoning each other, an engagement of which you knew when youentered my Government and which I have no knowledge of your having ever-asked me to denounce.2. It is inexact that Mr. Charles Reibel was an &quot; eye-witness &quot; of anythingwhatever. He profited from culpable and, for the most part, capriciousindiscretions.3. It is inexact that General Weygand wrote to me, on the 29th May and 7th June, &quot; more and more pressing letters &quot; asking me to conclude an armistice.He wrote to me. on the contrary, the 10th June, that he was &quot; far from having lost all hope,&quot; and he stated, the 11th June, in the evening, at the supreme council at Briare, at which you were present: &quot; We are in the last quarter-hour;there is no saying that we cannot ivin out in this last quarter-hour.&apos;&apos;&apos;11430   [22704] b
Such a flagrant untruth on such an important point of the history of the waris grievous for the reputation of our country.It is all the more inexplicable because I had written to you, on the6th September, 1940, to point out to you that the national broadcasting [stations]had spread it for the first time. They drew the conclusion therefrom, at thetime, that, &quot;if one had listened to Weygand, Italy woidd not have entered thewar,&apos;&quot; which is false, since she declared war on the 10th June, and denotes,moreover, let it be said en passant, a singular lack of knowledge of the psychologyof the Italian leaders. They would not have refrained from sharing in the spoilsbecause we had asked for an armistice from Germany.4. It is inexact that &quot; the armistice spared French families the henceforthvain sacrifice of their children.&quot;As soon as the [military] command declared that the fight had becomepurposeless, I proposed to stop it on the soil of metropolitan France, as it hadbeen in the Netherlands, which would have spared us the losses suffered during thelong periods which wrere necessary for the obtaining of the armistice. This wouldhave been the case if I had not been obliged to yield the power, succumbing to the coalition composed of yourself, General Weygand, and the majority of theMinisters to whom high military authorities stated: &quot; In three weeks Englandwill have her neck wrung like a chicken.&quot;It is not, therefore, the Government of which I was the head, nor any of its members, which can be accused of having thought that &apos;&apos; French blood had notflowed enough.&quot;That is a method of discussion unworthy even of a, public meeting.5. It is inexact to say that the armistice terms &quot; ivould have been lessonerous &quot; if it had been asked for sooner.When, on the 12th June, at Cange, General Weygand asked to conclude an armistice, our armies had succumbed in the home country. Germany showed, andshows every day, that she intends to obtain the maximum results from her victorywithin the framework and without the framework of the armistice.6. It is inexact that, at the Supreme Council which was held on the11th June (and not the 13th), at Briare (and not at Tours), Mr. Winston Churchillrefused any further assistance of the English air force.He promised, on the contrary, to study the question as soon as he returned toLondon.It is not less inexact that, &quot; for weeks, our soldiers had waited in vain forthe English pursuit planes,&quot; for we received, at my daily instances, importantassistance from the RA.F. In the light of what has happened since, no one canreproach the Prime Minister for not having engaged in the battle of France thewhole of an air force upon which, to-day, our chance of victory rests.As for the relation of words exchanged at that Supreme Council, it con-stitutes a lack of diplomatic correctness.  Not long since, France had deportment.7. It is inexact that President Roosevelt replied &quot; rather evasively &quot; to the message that I had sent to him on the 14th June.That is a failure to recognize the importance of his reply and the generositythat inspired it.In his telegram of the 15th June, which I read to the Council of Ministers,the President of the United States reminded me that, in response to my appeal,the American Government had, in the course of past weeks, supplied us withaeroplanes, guns (75&apos;s) and munitions of all kinds. He gave me, furthermore,the assurance that, &quot; as long as France continued the struggle, she could count on receiving war material and supplies in constantly increasing quantities.&quot;That was to say that America would have been for us as she has becomefor England a non-belligerent ally.Far from being &quot;rather evasive,&quot; this message was, on the contrary,singularly courageous if we bear in mind the date when it was sent.The judgment passed on it by the national broadcasting [system] is thereforeunfair and can bring joy only to the enemies of France.8. It is inexact that the offer of Franco-British union which was made tous the 16th June, 1940, would have &quot; reduced us to the rank of a dominion.&quot;
That offer contemplated the principle of a union which I was minded toaccept, subject to discussing the modalities of it later. As for me, I prefer to collaborate with my allies rather than with the enemy.9. It is inexact that the text of this agreement was &quot; telephoned to me from london by General de Gaulle, at Mr. Churchill&apos;s dictation.&quot;If it were true, moreover, who- would be affronted thereby ? General de Gaulle,a member of my Government, had been sent by merf on a mission to the british prime Minister. As a matter of fact, General de Gaulle telephoned the text tome and Mr. Winston Churchill telephoned me afterward to ask me my sentiment.What is there out of tihe way in all that?But here is what is more perfidious : &quot; A striking detail, at the other endof the wire, there was, as if by chance, at the side of the French Premier oneGeneral Spears, the chairman of the Franco-British Committee.&quot;Perfidious, in the first place, to me, who appeared as having been wantingin the dignity of my office.   I pass that.....But the attack on General Spears, who is one of the oldest and most faithfulfriends of France in the House of Commons and whom it is, at least, strange to treat as a suspect, is as unjustified as it is improper. He was regularly accreditedto me, Minister of War, by Mr. Churchill, and he was calling on me that day, in company with his ambassador. His position was therefore, as always, perfectlycorrect.I take the liberty of thinking that these old wives&apos; tales(&apos;) are unworthy of agreat country.Nothing is more to be scorned and more contrary to the national interestthan these insinuations and these constant attacks upon the leaders of a people whose heroism will assure our salvation.We know only too well who can rejoice at them.All these inexactitudes, however regrettable and damaging they may be,are a small thing beside the affirmation that General de Gaulle had contributedno more than the late General Estienne with respect to the use of tanks. for there we touch upon the essential cause of our defeat. And there, again. I amon trial on the first count.Do you believe that the people of France will never know that our highmilitary authorities declared that a continuous front, extending from the north sea to Switzerland, is invulnerable, and that the enemy could only cause breachesin it that would be the more dangerous for him the deeper they were ?Do you believe that they will never know that General de Gaulle declared to the contrary, that an armoured corps, the composition of which he defined,would be an instrument suited for breaking, at a point, that continuous front?Do you believe that they will never know :  1. That on the 31st March, 1935 five years before the German offensive ofMay 1940 I introduced in the Chamber a counter-plan establishingthat armoured corps ?2. That I announced that the German army would pass through Holland andBelgium, would shove the Belgian army aside on the Albert Canal,and would attack our northern frontier, which the Higher WarCouncil was refusing to fortify ?3. That we would be invaded by a German army composed of armoured divisions supported by combat aeroplanes if we did not have availablean armoured corps which alone could enable us to make a victorious, counter-offensive ?Do you believe that they will never know that my counter-plan was rejected,in France, as &quot; contrary to logic and history,&quot; but was adopted in Germany?Do you believe that they will never know that for years, through lectures,books, addresses, newspaper articles, I incessantly called for the adoption of mycounter-plan?Do you believe that they will never know that it was the German armouredcorps that broke our front on the Meuse in May 1940, then won the Battle ofFrance and forced the French army out of its positions, preventing it, by itsspeed, from ever establishing other positions anywhere ?(&apos;) French: &quot; romana chez la portiere.&quot; Translator.[22704] B 2
You know, better than any one else, because of the high authority that youexercised on the Higher War Council, of which you were a member, why mycounter-plan miscarried.You know better than any one else to what extent my counter-plan wasfought, since you offered to the public, just before the war, a book of your opinion,in which it could read, among so many other statements : &quot; As to the tanks that were to bring us back to short wars, their failure is striking.&quot;******To be sure, this is not the time to be starting this debate, when the enemy isin occupation of two-thirds of our territory.But, while awaiting the truth, silence is better than lying, and modesty thanprovocation. That is what the instructors on the radio and in the newspapersshould not forget.The danger from the lies, the incessant calumnies and petty defamationsthat have been prevalent for eight months is that the truth is like a gas whichexplodes with the greater force the more it has been compressed.I warn you solemnly, the reaction to this will be violent.It will be dreadful for the country.I tell you this because I know you to be capable of &quot; dominating &quot; the acclaimof official trips.Not belonging to any political party, I have always spoken freely.Seven years ago I asked an administration of which you formed part to lineup the franc with the pound sterling and the, dollar, which had been devalued,warning it that that was the only way to avoid social and political disturbancesdangerous to our safety.For years I tried to open the eyes of the high military authorities and theMinisters who were their advocates before the Parliament to the deadly perilthat threatened our country.They refused to listen to me.France has paid [for this].I ask nothing of you for myself.We collaborated closely when I was in power, and, if I refused to associatemyself with your policy, I did everything to make your task easier when yousucceeded me. I did so for the sake of the country. No one owes me any gratitudefor it.Your attitude towards me has been different.You put me in prison, in close confinement, seven months ago.In your name, the weekly publications of defamation were then told : &quot; Yousee that man, behind bars.  You can, if you wish, spit in his face as you pass by.&quot;They did this boldly for months, with the approval of your censors. Theyeven told lies in attempting to reach me. That does not matter in Francenowadays.You had a Keeper of the Seals who told the world, by an official statement,that he is &quot; known by all Frenchmen.&quot; On the testimony of a slander sheet, andas if my whole life did not protest against this crack-brained insinuation, hedeclared that I had undeniably enriched myself dishonestly, since I had brought50 million to an aircraft company. Now, I made that contribution, in my capacity as Minister of Finance, to a nationalised company! This would merely cause asmile if, strengthened by this certainty, that successor of Aguesseau&apos; had notattempted to justify, after the event, my internment and to discredit the man of resistance by the lowest of political manoeuvres, by getting you to sign a law justfor the purpose of taking away the jurisdiction of a judge who refused to prosecute me and for that of bringing before the Court of Riom such an absurdaccusation that it refused to legalise my internment. The last signs of his lackof balance are the things he is saying about you which scandalise the Midi-who had for a moment drawn him from nothingness.I do not have such a conception of public life.I have never thought of having those of my collaborators put in prison who,like you. did not share my opinion on the armistice. Instead of attempting todishonour them, when I had the opportunity in the past (perhaps you will learnthis, some day) of preserving the name of a certain one of them from any injury,I did so without his knowing it.* * * * * *
Keep me in prison, if you see fit.Our persons count for little.It will be the [greatest] honour of my life to have suffered for having held the word of France very high and for not having been willing to diminish the chances of victory of the coalition of which she formed part.But listen to the counsel of a Frenchman whom it would have been to his country&apos;s interest to listen to oftener.Order that this people no longer be told that the word of France does not count, that it should have been broken, towards Poland, on the 3rd September.1939, that it should have been broken, towards England, on the 16th June, 1940.Having lost &quot; everything but honour,&quot; what would be left to our people ifhonour were taken away from it?Order that our youth no longer be given the ideal of collaborating with auenemy who is annexing Alsace and Lorraine in contempt of the armistice and whose banners are floating over Paris, for we cannot straighten our backs andbend them at the same time.Order that the stoic people, our ally, on whom our salvation depends, nolonger be defamed.There can be no greater peril for a nation than to see its soul degraded.Return to what is, surely, at the bottom of your heart as a Frenchman.Please accept, &amp;c.PAUL REYNAUD.(Translation.)(Confidential communication.)Marshal, Vals, April 23, 1941.I REG-RET having to write to you again.I hope that this letter will be the last one.The national broadcasts declare (they have just repeated it) that we areresponsible for the war, into which England plunged us with the aid of the jews and the Freemasons. You know, as do all Frenchmen, that that is a historic lie.Those who disseminate it in your name doubtless believe that they are serving the country. History will relate, I believe, that this campaign conducted priorto the treaty of peace constitutes a crime against our native land. But that doesnot concern me any more than other Frenchmen.What do concern me are the calumnies which the radio continues to broad-cast about me. They tend to cause me to believe that my letter of the 5th Aprilwas not handed to you, the receipt of which, in violation of an old Frenchtradition, has not been acknowledged to me.Of these new calumnies, I will speak of only one.With regard to the request for an armistice made on the 12th June, at thefirst Cabinet meeting at Cange [ ? Gangey] by General Weygand, after a patheticpicture of the sufferings of our army, the radio brought yesterday the following statement: &quot; Reynaud, a docile tool in the hands of Churchill, thought that it wasnot useless to sacrifice thousands of French lives in order to alloiv theEnglish to re-embark and to destroy their materiel.&quot;In form, that is Ferdonnet.   Let us pass over that.In substance, that is one of the gravest accusations that can be directed against the former head of a French Government.You know that it is false.You know that, far from being willing to sacrifice French lives uselesslywhile awaiting for the long periods (a week, in fact) required for the conclusionof an armistice, I proposed, on the contrary, a surrender similar to that of theDutch army and the continuation of the combat beside our Allies, at sea and inour Empire.You know that, on the first point, I had convinced you, since at the cabinet meeting held on the 15th June at Bordeaux you left the council chamber, at my request, to go to General Weygand and try to convince him, and that you failed,Mdiich would have led me to relieve him of his command if, at the same meeting,the Cabinet had not declared itself for the principle of the armistice.   ,
You know, from having been present at the meetings of the Supreme Councilheld in France, that, far from having been &quot; a docile tool in the hands ofMr. Churchill,&quot; I was, on the contrary, a loyal but exacting ally.You know, for you were there, how, at the Supreme Council meeting heldat Paris on the 31st May, 1940, I got the English to embark from then on, atDunkirk, a larger proportion of French soldiers, &quot; the English troops remaining in the rearguard as much as possible.&quot;You know the telegram, the text of which was recently given by the Frenchradio, that I sent to Mr. Winston Churchill on the 24th May, when the Englisharmy abandoned its movement towards the south, in the direction of the Somme,for reasons to Avhich history alone will be able to apply an impartial judgment.It would have been more fitting, besides, to give Mr. churchill&apos;s reply also.You know, for you were there, that at the meeting of the Supreme Councilheld at Briare on the 11th and 12th June I spoke to our Allies with a roughfrankness, since the radio recently had the impropriety, moreover, to reproduceone of the speeches which I made there.You know that, Mr. Churchill having asked of me on the 12th June that theFrench Government should not make any decision without having heard him,the Cabinet asked me to request him to come the next day. Foreseeing the dangerof a break between France and England in case the request for an armisticesupported by you and General Weygand should gain a majority in the cabinet and should lead to my resignation, I called to mind the saying of the Dued&apos;Aumale : &quot; France was left.&quot; I presented to Mr. Churchill, Lord Halifax andLord Beaverbrook, who had come to Tours, such a picture of the sufferings ofFrance and the services rendered to the coalition by her that Mr. Churchill, withtears in his eyes, gave me his promise that, if France asked for an armistice someday, and if England were victorious, France would be restored &quot; in her powerand her dignity.&quot; This promise was repeated by him several times after that.After that interview, I again went to combat the armistice with all my strength at the second meeting of the Cabinet, held at [ ? Cangey]. It was not due to methat France was the only one of the eight countries at war against Germany thatcapitulated, although she had the second navy in Europe and the second colonial empire in the world.In acting thus, did I show myself &quot; a docile tool in the hands of Churchill &quot; 1The truth is that, contrary to the repeated affirmations of the radio, Mr. winston churchill did not have to ask me not to conclude an armistice, because he knew that I was against it, and that, as long as I should be head of the FrenchGovernment, it would not be asked for.You know that, a few days after my resignation, I telegraphed to him, inmy own name, to ask him not to continue a public polemic against you, whichcould only delight the enemy.You know all that, and yet the despicable work of which I have spoken isbeing carried on under cover of your name.If I am writing to you about this, it is because I believe this work detrimental to the country.But if you were informed of this you would think also, as I do, that to haveyour predecessor calumniated publicly is not in keeping with French traditions.I simply wish to say, in closing, that when I was at the head of the Govern-ment the national broadcasting s)rstem was employed for other purposes thandaily inciting Frenchmen to hate each other.Please accept, &amp;c.PAUL REYNAUD.
