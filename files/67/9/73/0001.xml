COPY WO.   - rw.p.(g)   (43-) 73.    . \ -/J&apos;!.;- -WAR C/J3INET. ;:.:r v-rf-4-th August, 194-1*BUMPERING- FACILITIES FOR JAPANESE SEEPS &apos; -Note by First Lord of Admiralty and Minister of War Transports1.     Measures have been in operation for some time to secure that allapplications for facilities under British Control including bunkers, are referred to the Ministry of War Transport in London in respect of allJapanese ships.     Facilities are granted only on receipt of approval from london.2.     In all suitable cases, the instructions are to impose a delay offorty-eight hours in supplying bunkers or stores, and to limit quantities.Bunkers are supplied sufficient for the next port of call only, unless theship is proceeding direct to Japan, in which case bunkers for Japan are granted.     It is likely that except where bunkers have boon paid for inadvance some additional delay may be caused by the need to obtain a licence to release assets frozen under the recent ordor for the payment for the oil or coal to be supplied.3.     Complete denial of bunkering facilities is the only further restrictivestep;    this can be imposed either for particular ships or as a generalpolicy, on the issue of instructions to that effect from the Bunker ControlSection of the Ministry of War Transport.A.     According to the latest information in our possession, an immediatedenial of facilities in British ports might affect10 ships in the Indian Ocean.3   &quot; &quot;        Vancouver.2   &quot; &quot;        Australia.1   &quot; &quot;        South Africa.It is known that ships trading to British ports have provided themselves with the maximum possible reserves, and those in the Indian Ocean may have enough bunkers to enable them to return east of Singapore.     Some, however,would be immobilised.     If they seek to get home via the Atlantic,paragraphs (5) and (6) apply.5.     In addition to the above, there may be a.s many as fifteen Japaneseships in the Atlantic which, owing to the repairs to the Panama Canal, maybe forced to return to home waters by Cape Horn.     These may apply forbunkers in Brazil, Argentina or Uruguay and instructions have already beensent to British Companies in South America to refer applications to thisDepartment.     His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Airesand Montevideo have been advised to this effect.     Bunkers in South Americanports are in any case limited by the fact that stocks are short and inUruguay and the Argentine the local authorities put a drastic limit on theamount of fuel supplied to ships not trading in the particular country&apos;interest.
6.     As regards the United States Companies, under a voluntary arrangement which has been in force for some months the principal United States OilBunkering Companies report nominations which they receive for shipswithout Warrants to the Ministry of War Transport through Sir Ashley Sparks,if they have no contractual commitment to supply.     Whenever they feel theycan reasonably do so, they delay or refuse supply if the De-partment sorequests.     Insiructions have been sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington to discuss the matter with the United States State Departmentwith a view to ensuring that action is taken to strengthen the presentvoluntary control of supplies from United States Companies as regardsJapanese ships, and to ascertain whether the United States administration is prepared to restrict facilities to such ships under their control orthe control of United States Companies.Even if the United States Companies co-operate fully, it cannot beassumed that Japanese ships would be quite unable to get bunkers inSouth American ports.7.     To deny bunkers entirely will no doubt be regarded by the Jananeseas a provocative act, and this is a further reason for keeping in step with the United States of America.     For our part, however, it can bejustified by our own needs which require a reduction of off-take fromBritish bunker stocks.     Retaliatory action by the Japanese against british ships would not bo a substantial deterrent since no vessels under british or Allipd control are now proceeding to Japan, and with the exception ofthree &quot;Moller&quot; ships repairing in Shanghai, there are no important british vessels other than small coasters on the China coast north of Hong Kong.8.     Complete denial of bunkers to oil Japanese ships is a drastic measure which may be interpreted as a sign that war is already regarded as inevitable.     We consider that this measure should be kept in reserve to counter any further Japanese threat to our security that we do not wishto treat as a cause for actually declaring war.     To impose it now mightpush the Japanese too far and would appear inconsistent with the apparentintention of the United States to license a certain amount of trade with japan,9.     We therefore propose that -(a) restriction of bunkers for Japanese ships should not proceed beyond, that described in paragraphs 1 and 2until it is known whether the U.S. Government arcprepared to impose control on supplies by U.S. Companies$(b) complete denial of bunkers to all Japanese ships should only bo instituted in pursuance of a -policy of &quot;parallelaction&quot; with the U.S. to moot some new development.A. V, A.L.MINISTRY OF WAR TRANSPORT,kth August, 1941.
