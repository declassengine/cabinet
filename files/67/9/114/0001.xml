Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (*) (41) 114.October 18, 1941.WAR CABINET.FRANCE.Fulfilment of Pre-War Undertakings by Great Britain.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT a Meeting of the War Cabinet held on the 12th June, 1941 (W.M. (41)59th Conclusions, Minute 7), a suggestion was made that it might be a good plan to consider whether a statement should be published setting out what ourpre-war obligations to France had been, and the steps which had been taken togive effect to them.A Memorandum on this subject has been compiled by the Foreign Office, thethree Service Departments and the War Cabinet Secretariat, acting inconsultation.This document, which is much too long for publication and is in certain other respects unsuitable for this purpose, is intended to provide a full statement of the facts agreed between the Departments concerned, from whichmaterial can be drawn as and when necessary to combat propaganda.The question remains whether it would be desirable at this stage that a muchshorter document should be prepared, giving our answers to the variousstatements which have been made from time to time alleging that we failed to fulfil our pre-war obligations to France. These allegations have not been inany way prominent in recent months, and my own view is that the matter is much better left alone for the present.A. E.Foreign Office, October 18, 1941.[23028]
