this  JOClflEtflir IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS MAJESTY&apos; S BRITANNIC GOv^MSNr..fg)(4l)6.hjanuary, 1941.WAR CABINET. .Copy No.ITALIAN PRISONERS OP WAR .POR LAND RECLAMATION WORK.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1.     In many counties men are required to work in gangs on urgent drainage,ditching and reclamation work-2.     I have suggested to the Secretary of State for War that 2,000 to 3,000North Italian peasants from among the prisoners of war taken in Libya should bebrought to this country at once to be formed into gangs to work under county agricultural Executive Committees.;  The Secretary of State for War agrees to thiscourse provided that the prisoners are carefully selected so that they would not include any violent or Fascist types.   He feels, however, that the question ofpolicy of bringing Italian prisoners to the United Kingdom should be brought up for cabinet decision.3.     The Ministry of Shipping can provide the necessary shipping, but have raised the question of efecort, which is one for the Admiralty.    The Admiralty saythey could not guarantee that an escort would be available, but do not considerspecial protection to be necessary.4.     If the prisoners can be made available, the Minister of Labour has noobjection to the proposal provided that the Italian prisoners work in gangs underthe County Committees.5,     I ask therefore that the Cabinet should authorise the Secretary of Statefor Far to arrange for 2,0.00 to 3,000 suitable North Italian prisoners to bebrought immediately to this country.(Itld.)R.S.H.fkiinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries13th January, 1941.
