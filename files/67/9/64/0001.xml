Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 64.July 9. 1941.WAR CABINET.ARRANGEMENTS FOR CONTROL OF LABOUR ADMITTED INTOTHE UNITED KINGDOM FROM EIRE.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.OWING to the shortage of labour required for the completion of importantGovernment contracts, arrangements have been made by the Minister of Labourand National Service for the recruitment of unskilled labourers in Eire. Forpurposes of production there are arguments for continuing this arrangement ona large scale, and it is thought that the numbers involved may be of the order of30,000, in addition to some 10/15,000 men whom it is proposed to import foragricultural work this summer.2. The importation of labour on this scale from Eire would obviously raiseimportant considerations of security, which require to be balanced against the damage to our war effort which would follow from the exclusion of such labour.At present the only security safeguard exists in the requirement that a visa mustbe obtained in each case from the United Kingdom Permit Office in Dublin, andthat visas are not granted if there are known to be any objections on security grounds in individual cases. There is at present no means of controlling the menafter their arrival in this country, unless they commit actual offences againstthe law.3. The Security Services do not object in principle to arrangements beingmade for the importation of labour from Eire on the scale contemplated but, inview of the obvious difficulty of making adequate enquiries in the case of such large numbers before the grant of visas, they stipulate that there should be afull measure of control over the labour in this country.4. This aspect of the matter has been fully discussed with the security services and the other Departments concerned and it has been agreed to establish a scheme of control of which the following are the main features : (a) the grant of a visa should, as at present, be conditional on the absenceof security objections to an individual;(&amp;) the permit to enter and remain in this country should be limited to employment on a specific job for which the man is imported, subjectto the possibility of his transfer to other employment with the approvalof the Ministry of Labour and National Service;(c) the permit to be valid in the first instance for six months only, but to berenewable at the discretion of the Chief Constable of the district forfurther periods of six months at a time;(d) the men to be required on arrival to register with the police; photographsof them to be kept by the police, and the police to be notified of anychange of their adddess;(e) the men to be liable to be sent back to Eire (i) on the expiry of their permits;(ii) on their ceasing for any reason to be employed on work approvedby the Ministry of Labour;[22697]
(iii) on grounds of misconduct or any breach of the conditions of grantof leave to land; or(iv) if the Secretary of State thinks it conducive to the public good;(/) no new visa to be granted to a person who has been returned to Eire on security grounds or because his employment was terminated owing tomisconduct, or to any person who returns to Eire within six monthsof his arrival in this country.5. It has to be admitted that it is not possible to devise any scheme whichwill afford absolute security against the admission of undesirable persons, but itis considered that the above safeguards will reduce to a minimum the securityrisks. The question of policy for decision by the War Cabinet is whether theneed for Irish labour is so great that the security risk may be accepted.H. M.Home Office, July 9. 1941.
