Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.SECRET. Copy No.    C*W.P. (G) (41) 139.November 26, 1941.WAR CABINET.PUBLICATION OF DOCUMENTS ILLUSTRATING THE COURSEOF ANGLO-GERMAN RELATIONS BETWEEN LOCARNO and march  1939.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT will be of great importance at the peace settlement, and during the critical post-war years, that public opinion here, and still more in the UnitedStates of America, should be well informed about the events leading up to thepresent war. After the last war, German propaganda skilfully misled foreignopinion, and more particularly the general public here and in the United Statesof America. This German propaganda was much facilitated by the fact thatthe Germans had been the first of the Western Powers after 1918 to publish ona large scale material from their diplomatic archives, with the result that themajority of American, and even many English, professors tended to accept theGerman version of diplomatic history before 1914; and a generation of americans and Englishmen grew up with a disposition to-be influenced by german propaganda theses.2. I have therefore considered whether it would not be well to publish afurther collection of diplomatic documents illustrating the course of Anglo-German relations from Locarno until the German entry into Prague in 1939.The Blue Book issued shortly after the outbreak of war dealt only with the polish question, and only covered the period from the occupation of Prague until theoutbreak of war. There is therefore no full and authoritative account of theunceasing activity of British foreign policy in the period between the two warsfor the maintenance of peace and for the improvement of Anglo-German relations,more particularly after the Locarno settlement.3. Documents have accordingly been collected which give a comprehensiveaccount of Anglo-German relations from 1925 to 1939. Apart from the beneficial effect these documents should have in enlightening opinion for the peace settlement and after, they should also serve an immediately useful purpose by providing material to counter German propaganda about the New Order and the anti-Bolshevik crusade. They supply a convincing exposure of German duplicityand brutality over a long period, and show the Germans at their worst; at thesame time they should help to clear His Majesty&apos;s Government from currentsuspicions held abroad about British foreign policy, and in particular from theabsurd charge levelled at us in Ribbentrop&apos;s preface to one of his collections of documents, namely, that we have been plotting aggression against Germany for years. The documents show conclusively that successive Governments workedsincerely for an understanding with Germany.4.   It may be suggested that the publication of these documents would provoke criticism to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government were foolish intrusting so much to German professions, but I think that this risk is worth taking.11557   [23192]
5. A consideration which has also weighed with me is that there is likelyto be a demand after the war for a full account of British policy, and it may bepolitic to meet such a demand in advance and at a time when there is no possibilityof the documents being arranged and presented to suit a particular point of view.It is also important that these documents should be available in time to be digestedby public opinion here and in the United States of America well before the peace settlement, and therefore that they should appear in the near future.6. I have consulted my predecessors at the Foreign Office during the periodcoyered by these documents. Lord Simon, Sir Samuel Hoare and Lord Halifaxare all in favour of publication.7. I am satisfied that publication would be in the public interest, and i accordingly recommend that it should take place without delay.&quot;A. E.Foreign Office,November 26, 1941.
