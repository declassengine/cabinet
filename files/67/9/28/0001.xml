Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 28.February 21, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AMD KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ALLIED SEAMEN.Proposed Legislation to enable the best use to be made of Allied Ships&apos; and Allied Seamen in the Allied War Effort.Joint Memorandum by the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of Labour and,:   National Service, the Home Secretary and the Minister of Shipping.IT is hardly necessary to stress the importance of ensuring that full use ismade of all available shipping, and that such shipping should not be immobilised by lack of the necessary man-power.2. There are at the present moment approximately 6 million dead-weighttons of Allied merchant ships available for use in the common war effort and thenumber of Allied officers and men on these ships amounts to about 30,000. Inaddition there is in this country a considerable number of Allied nationals whohave sea-going experience and could be employed if the necessary powers wereavailable to help to man this Allied Fleet.3. For some time past the Allied Governments in this country have beencomplaining to the British Authorities of their lack of powers to discipline theirmen and to compel their nationals in this country, who have the necessaryqualifications, to go to sea. The rate of wages paid to Allied seamen comparesfavourably with that paid to British seamen, but whereas there is power under defence Regulation 58a to direct any person in the United Kingdom to performservice in any British ship, there is..no power to compel an Allied national to goto sea except on a British ship.4. It is difficult to estimate the extent to which the war effort has beenhampered by the absence of powers to deal with Allied seamen, but there havebeen very many short delays and the cumulative loss of shipping services has been considerable. For example, there were recently in the ports of this country thirtyGreek ships held up for lack of Greek crews, although it was known that therewere over 800 unemployed Greek seamen here who were being offered much higher wages than those paid either to British or to other Allied seamen. There has alsobeen a heavy and continued loss of parrying power owing to breaches of disciplinewhich have held up Allied ships in ports here and abroad.5. The problem for solution may conveniently be considered under twoheads, namely : (A) Power to maintain discipline over the crews serving on Allied ships andto deal with offences committed on such ships on the high seas; and(B) Power to compel Allied seamen in this country to man Allied ships.11298   [22248]
(A) Power to discipline crews of Allied ships and to deal with offences committed in these ships on the high seas.6.   The position under the law of the United Kingdom is, generally,. asfollows :  (a) the ordinary criminal law of this country, as well as the disciplinaryprovisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts, apply to all persons of whatever nationality on board British ships, wherever those shipsmay be;(6) the ordinary criminal law of this country applies to all persons of what-ever nationality on board a foreign ship when in territorial waters ofthe United Kingdom; and(c) certain criminal offences (e.g., murder, manslaughter, treason and offences against the Defence Regulations) constitute offences under the law ofthe United Kingdom when committed by British subjects outside, aswell as inside, the United Kingdom.7. On the other hand, acts and omissions by foreign subjects in foreign ships on the high seas outside territorial waters are not offences against the law of the United Kingdom, and (subject to paragraph 6 (c) above) the same is true of acts and omissions by British subjects on board foreign ships on the high seasoutside territorial waters. Accordingly legislation is necessary if such acts oromissions are to be dealt with in this country as offences.8. In our view it is urgently necessary that powers be provided to enableeffective discipline to be maintained over seamen serving in Allied ships and todeal with offences committed on such ships outside the British territorial waters.9.   There are only two possible courses open, namely, either (a) to pass an Act of Parliament extending British law to Allied ships; or(b) to pass legislation empowering Allied Governments to enforce disciplinehere under their own laws on their merchant seamen and to deal herewith offences committed on their ships if committed outside british ports or territorial waters.10. The first alternative is open to the strongest objections. The policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government is to uphold the dignity and status of AlliedGovernments as the Governments of Sovereign Powers and to assist them, as faras possible, to exercise authority over their nationals who are outside enemy control, and, in pursuance of this policy, Parliament has already conferred on theAllied Governments, under the Allied Forces Act, 1940, powers of jurisdiction over their Armed Forces in this country in respect of military offences. TheAllied Governments themselves would strongly resent any such proposal whichwould, not unreasonably, strike them as being an usurpation of their jurisdiction,and authority over their own nationals and ships. Moreover, if British law weremade to apply to crews of Allied nationality serving in Allied ships the officers;and men would tend to regard the war more and more as being a war in whichthey were engaged merely as mercenaries fighting solely for Britain and Britishinterests. Representations have been made to the Ministry of Shipping, in discussions with representatives of Allied officers and men, that it is essential,if the morale and enthusiasm of Allied seamen are to be maintained, that theAllied crews should be subject to the authority of their own Governments and legal systems, and we concur in this view. It would be of great assistance to german propaganda if opportunity were given to represent to Allied seamen,with whom German agents have direct contacts in neutral ports, that by beingmade subject to the British legal system they were losing their national identityand being absorbed in an. alien struggle and that the sure way to lose their libertywas to serve the Allied cause at sea.11. For these reasons we have come to the conclusion that the right course is to enable the Allied Governments to enforce discipline under their own lawsby their own Courts in this country over merchant seamen serving.on Allied ships and to exercise jurisdiction in respect of offences committed on such ships outsideBritish ports or territorial waters. This is a far-reaching proposal for whichthere is no exact precedent,.but the situation resulting from the presence in thiscountry of Sovereign Allied Governments is in itself without precedent, and novelexpedients have accordingly been devised. &quot;As in the case of the Allied Forces
Act, this proposal would not oust the jurisdiction of our Courts to deal withcriminal offences committed by Allied seamen within our jurisdiction, and detailed arrangements would be made with the Allied Governments to ensure that allserious offences committed by Allied seamen within our jurisdiction should bedealt with by our Courts.12. We would propose, however, that the powers to be conferred on AlliedGovernments should not authorise any Allied Court to deal with any british subject. We regard this as an essential part of the scheme, since, in our view,Parliament would not tolerate a position in which a British subject could besentenced for an offence by a foreign Court in this country and deprived of the safeguards enjoyed by every British subject in this country. On the other hand,some provision must be made for dealing with British subjects who are guilty of misconduct on or in relation to Allied ships, and we propose that in any legislation on this subject British subjects should be exempted subject to this qualification, that if they are guilty of misconduct on board, or in relation to,Allied ships which, if committed on board, or in relation to, a British ship, would constitute offences against the law of the United Kingdom, they shall be guilty of an offence against that law and punishable accordingly.(B) Power to direct Allied Seamen to serve on Allied ships.13. We have already called attention to the necessity for making the fullest use of the available Allied seamen to man Allied shipping, and we are satisfiedthat the time has now come when a similar power should be taken to requireAllied nationals who have had sea service to serve in Allied ships to that which already exists under Defence B,egulation 58A to require British subjects to serve on British ships.14. The question arises whether these powers should be exercised by HisMajesty&apos;s Government or by the Allied Governments under their own legislation.In July last the War Cabinet approved the principle that the obligation on allied nationals in the United Kingdom for civilian (as well as military) war service should be the same as those upon British subjects. There were, and are, strong and obvious political reasons for encouraging the Allied Governments to develop their own maximum war effort, and when consideration was given to the arrange-ments to give effect to the Cabinefs decision it appeared that the right policy was undoubtedly to allow the sovereign Allied Governments in this country firstcall on the services of their nationals within our jurisdiction, and that, inexercising this first call, the Allied Governments should act on their own initiative and in their own name. The Allied Governments in this country were accordingly informed in a circular note addressed to them by the Foreign office on the 15th August last (dealing with the whole question of the employment ofAllied man-power) that His Majesty&apos;s Government were examining the questionof powers of the Allied Governments to enforce upon their nationals, if theyshould so desire, obligations to perform some service by their direction in a civilian capacity, such as service in their national mercantile marines, and hopedthat they might be able to assist the Allied Governments in this matter.15. We are satisfied that this is still the right policy and that the AlliedGovernments should, as soon as possible, be authorised by Act of Parliament toenforce upon their nationals who are seamen, or who have previously served asseamen, the obligation to serve in their respective Allied mercantile marines.The Allied Governments either already have powers under their existing legis-lation for this purpose or would proceed to take them. If it is agreed that AlliedGovernments should be granted these powers to compel their own seamen to goto sea, this decision should not be regarded as a precedent necessarily to befollowed in the matter of conscription of Allied nationals for military or industrial service in this country.16. The question arises whether this Allied legislation to compel allied nationals to go to sea should be enforced by British courts or by Allied courts.The reasons which lead us to think that Allied courts must deal with discipline and offences on board Allied ships apply with even greater force to this moreimportant aspect of the problem. We think it indispensable to allow Alliedcourts to exercise jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing their own legislation
requiring their nationals to serve in their mercantile marines, and this functionwould presumably be entrusted to the same courts as would be set up by the allies to enforce discipline and deal with offences committed on board their ships.Position of French Ships and French Seamen.17.   There are a number of French merchant ships and French merchant seamen still working in the Allied cause.   The great majority of these ships aresailing under the British flag, and accordingly the Merchant Shipping Acts applyto them.  But General de Gaulle has always asserted his right of control over theFrench seamen serving in these ships, and the agreement signed with him by thePrime Minister on the 7th August last acknowledges his general interest in themen.   In respect of jurisdiction over his Armed Forces, General de Gaulle hasbeen granted under the Allied Forces Act treatment equivalent to that accorded to the Allied Governments.   But circumstances, particularly the fact that mostof the ships in which the French seamen are serving are or will be flying theBritish flag, do not appear to make it either appropriate or- feasible to extend toGeneral de Gaulle the powers which it is proposed to confer on the AlliedGovernments.   But it is possible that when he hears of the proposed legislationGeneral de Gaulle will assert a claim to some measure of jurisdiction over theFrench seamen, in view of his general interest in these seamen and of the precedent of the Allied Forces Act, which puts him on a similar footing tothe Allied Governments in respect of jurisdiction over armed forces.   any representations General de Gaulle may make would have to be considered on their merits.  In the meantime it is not suggested that any special provision should bemade for the case of the Free French Merchant seamen in the legislation now recommended.Safeguards against abuses.18. If the proposals to empower Courts of the Allied Governments toexercise jurisdiction in this country in the matter of Allied seamen be accepted;it will be necessary to provide certain safeguards against abuses.  We propose (1) Unless an Allied seaman voluntarily submits himself to the jurisdiction of the foreign court, he shall have an opportunity of appearing before a British Court, which would be required to satisfy itself that theperson in question is amenable to the jurisdiction of the foreignCourt. The question whether or not special British Courts shouldbe set up for this purpose will require careful consideration.(2) That the decision of a British Court that a person brought before it isamenable to the jurisdiction of a foreign Court in this country shouldbe the subject of appeal to a superior British Court (possibly to aDivisional Court or to a Judge in Chambers). Provision for such anappeal would be especially desirable where the point at issue is whether the person is, or is not, a British subject.(3) The Allied Governments should be informed (as) that it would be in thecommon interest that the standards of punishment to be applied bythe Allied Courts should approximate as closely as possible to the standards of our Courts in respect of similar offences, and (b) thatHis Majesty&apos;s prisons will not be available to carry out sentencesother than sentences of imprisonment or penal servitude and that thetreatment of Allied nationals detained in our prisons will be deter-mined by the principles of our penal system.We regard it as of the utmost importance that powers to discipline Alliedseamen and to require them to go to sea should be available at the earliest possible moment, and if the principles outlined in this memorandum commend themselvesto the War Cabinet, we should be glad to receive their authority to proceed withthe preparation of a Bill with a view to its introduction in Parliament at a very early date.A.
