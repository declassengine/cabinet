SECRET.V7.P. (G)(41) 40.21ST APRIL,  1941.war cabinet.INVASION:     INSTRUCTIONS TO THE PUBLIC.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.1* At their Meeting on the loth March,  the War cabinet approved the issue of a Leaflet to householders containinginstructions for the general public in the event of invasion.    The Prime Minister undertook to write anintroductory paragraph, which would appear at the head ofthe Leaflet over his signature  (W.M.(41)  28th Conclusions,Minute 7).2, The issue of this Leaflet was intended to be theclimax of a series of measures designed to &quot;bring home tothe public the dangers of invasion.    The plan was to distribute it to householders, with all the weight of authority of the Prime Minister1s Foreword,  at the psychological moment when the minds of the public had beenprepared and it would have the maximum effect.3. Since this plan was approved,  circumstances have changed. Other events have distracted people1s minds fromthe thought of invasion, other news has crowded it out ofthe press, and the secuenee of publicity measures designedto make people conscious of the invasion risk has been interrupted. If the Leaflet were issued now, it could nothave anything like the effect on the public mind which was originally intended.4. The new position has been considered by those whopreviously reviewed, at the request of the War Cabinet,our civil precautions against invasion.A majority took the view that the Leaflet ought tobe issued at the moment when it was likely to have themaximum effect,  and that in the changed circumstances,  theright course was to postpone its issue for the time being.It was felt that,  if it were issued now, people would give it scant attention and would be unlikely to keep theircopies by them against the time when they would need to look again at the instructions.    Moreover,  once issued,the Leaflet could not be distributed again when invasionwas thought to be imminent;    and the great value of thePrime Minister1 s Foreword would have been lost hy &quot;being issued at the wrong moment.COPY NO.-1-

On the other side it was urged that public interestin the possibility of invasion ought not to be allowed tocontinue to wane,  and that if issued now,  the Leafletmight serve to revive public interest.    The instruotionscontained in the Leaflet appeared in the Press some weelcsago, with an announcement that these,  in Leaflet form witha Foreword by the Prime Minister, were about to be distributed to householdersj    and the question may at anytime be raised why the issue of the promised Leaflet hasbeen deferred,5o The courses now open are:-(a) To proceed at once with general distribution,even though the moment is unsuitable,(b) To postpone the distribution until a morefavourable moment - explaining,  ifquestions are raised, that the Leafletis held ready and will be issued at theappropriate time.(c) To postpone general distribution, but tomake at once a fairly wide issue toselected recipients such as the police and members of the other Civil defence services whose duty it will be to give advice to the general public in theevent of invasion.In my view,  the third course has much to commend itj    for,while it would serve to maintain some degree of publicinterest in these matters,  general distribution to allhouseholders would be kept in reserve for use at themoment when it becomes important to remind the public asa whole of the instructions contained in the Leaflet.(initialled)      J.A.Privy Council Office,21ST APRIL,   194-1,

Issued by the Ministry of information in&quot; co-operation with   the   War   Officeand the Ministry of Home SecurityBeating the INVADERA MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTERF invasion comes, everyone young or old,men and women-will be eager to play their partworthily. By far the greater part of the country will not be immediately involved. Even along ourcoasts, the greater part will remain unaffected.But where the enemy lands, or tries to land, therewill be most violent fighting. Not only will there be the battles when the enemy tries to come ashore,but afterwards there will fall upon his lodgmentsvery heavy British counter-attacks, and all thetime the lodgments will be under the heaviestattack by British bombers. The fewer civilians ornon-combatants in these areas, the better ; and,if you are advised by the authorities to leave theplace where you live, it is your duty to go elsewherewhen you are &quot;told to leave. When the attackbegins, it will be too late to go ; and, unless youreceive definite instructions to move, your dutythen will be to stay where you are. You will haveto get into the safest place you can find, and staythere until the battle is over. For all of you then the order and the duty will be : &quot; stand firm &quot;.This also applies to people inland if any con-siderable number of parachutists or air-bornetroops are landed in their neighbourhood.  above all, they must not cumber the roads. Like their fellow-countrymen on the coasts, they must&quot; STAND FIRM &quot;. The Home Guard, sup-ported by strong mobile columns wherever theenemy&apos;s number require it, will immediately cometo grips with the invaders, and there is little doubtwill soon destroy them.. Throughout the rest of the country where thereis no fighting going on and no close cannon fireor rifle fire can be heard, everyone will govern his conduct by the second great order and duty,namely, &quot; CARRY ON &quot;. It may easily be some weeks before the invader has been totally destroyed,that is to say, killed or captured to the last man who has landed on bur shores. Meanwhile, allwork must be continued to the utmost, and no time lost.The following notes have been prepared to telleveryone in rather more detail what to do, andthey should be carefully studied. Each man andwoman should think out a clear plan of personalaction in accordance with the general scheme.STAND FIRMI. What do I do if fighting breaks out in my neigh,bourhood ?Keep indoors or in your shelter until the battle is over.If you can have a trench ready in your garden or field,so much the better. You may want to use it for protection if your house is damaged. But if you areat work, or if you have special orders, carry on as longas possible and only take cover when danger approaches.If you are on your way to work, finish your journeyif you can.If you see an enemy tank, or a few enemy soldiers,do not assume that the enemy are in control of thearea. What you have seen may be a party sent on inadvance, or stragglers from the main body who can easily be rounded up.
CARRY on . What do I do in areas which are some way fromthe fighting ?Stay in your district and carry on. Go to workwhether in shop, field, factory or office. Do yourshopping, send your children to school until you are told not to. Do not try to go and live somewhereelse. Do not use the roads for any unnecessary journey;they must be left free for troop movements even along way from the district where actual fighting is taking place.3. Will certain roads and railways be reserved forthe use of the Military, even in areas far from the scene of action ?Yes, certain roads will have to be reserved forimportant troop movements ; but such reservationsshould be only temporary. As far as possible, buscompanies and railways will try to maintain essentialpublic services, though it may be necessary to cutthese down. Bicyclists and pedestrians may use theroads for journeys to work, unless instructed not todo so. - :ADVICE AND ORDERS4. Whom shall I ask for advice?The police and A.R.P. wardens!5. From whom shall I take orders?In most cases from the police and A.R.P. wardens.But there may be times when you will have to takeorders- from the military and the Home Guard in uniform.6. Is there any means by which I can tell that anorder is a true order and not faked ?You will generally know your policeman and yourA.R.P. wardens by sight, and can trust them. With abit of common sense you can tell if a soldier is reallyBritish or only pretending to be so. If in doubt aska policeman, or ask a soldier whom you knowpersonally.INSTRUCTIONS7. What does it mean when the church bells are rung?It is a warning to the local garrison that troops havebeen seen landing from the- air in the neighbourhoodof the church in question. Church bells will not berung all over the country as a general warning thatinvasion has taken place. The ringing of church bellsin one place will not be taken up in neighbouringchurches.8. Will   instructions  be given over  the wireless?Yes; so far as possible. But remember that the enemycan overhear any wireless message, so that the wirelesscannot be used for instructions which might give himvaluable information.GIVE ALL THE HELP YOUDo not tell the enemy anythingDo not give(55001) Wt. ..../...   30, 40, 40, 25,26, 60, 76 pi).  8/41   Hw. G.619. In what other ways will instructions be given? IThrough the Press ; by loudspeaker vans ; and perhaps \iby&apos; leaflets -and posters.   But remember that genuine 1Government leaflets wilt be given to you only by the 1policeman, your A.R.P. warden or your postman ; Iwhile genuine posters and instructions will be put up I. only&apos; on Ministry vof Information notice boards and Iofficial sites, such as police stations, post offices, 1A.R.P. posts, town halls and schools.FOOD 110. Should I try to lay in extra food?No.   If you have already laid in a stock of food, keep Iit for a real emergency ; but do not add to it.   The flGovernment has made arrangements for food supplies. 9NEWS 1II. Will normal news services continue?Yes.    Careful   plans  have  been  made  to   enable 9newspapers and wireless broadcasts to carry on, and min case of need there are emergency measures whichwill bring you the news.   But if there should be some atemporary breakdown in news supply,  it is very 3important that you should not listen to rumours nor mpass them on, but should wait till real news comes 9through again. Do not use the telephones or send Mtelegrams if you can possibly avoid it.MOTOR-CARS 112. Should I put my car, lorry .or motor-bicycle out 3of action?Yes, when you are told to do so by the police, A.R.P. Bwardens or military ; or when it is obvious that there Mis an immediate risk of its being seized by the enemy  jthen disable and hide your bicycle and destroy your flmaps.13. How should it be put out of action?Remove distributor head -and leads and either -empty fljthe tank or remove the carburettor.   -If you don&apos;t i know how to do this, find out now from your nearest flgarage.    In the case of diesel engines remove the 9injection pump and connection. The parts removed i must be hidden well away from the Vehicle.THE ENEMY I14. Should I defend myself against the enemy?The enemy is not likely to turn aside to attack Iseparate houses.    If small parties are going about Hthreatening persons and property in an area not under 11enemy control and come your way, you have the right of every man and woman to do what you can to protect Iyourself, your family and your home.CAN TO OUR TROOPShim anythingDo hot help him in any way M
