S ECRE T.........- ^W. P. (G) (41)50. COPY NO. f %19TH MAY.  1941.WAR CABINET.WHIT HOLIDAYS IN 1941.Memorandum by the Chairman of ,the Production Executive.1. I understand that the Secretary of State for   War feels that the workmen of this country need to be told of the vital necessity that they should not ease up,  and wishes the PrimeMinister to adopt the suggestion made in the fourth paragraphof the Minister of Supply&apos;s paper to the Production Executive,P.E.(41)90, copy annexed, that the Prime Minister should makea public statements2. The Minister of Supply&apos;s memorandum, containing aproposal that the  Writ Holiday should be cancelled in the caseof firms and factories engaged upon specially urgent munitions work, was considered by the Production Executive at their meeting on 14th May.    This proposal was approved.3. In the course of the discussion it was suggested that,as a public announcement had already been made to the effectthat Whit Monday would be a    holiday, it Avas desirable, in ordeto avoid confusion, that no further public announcement shouldbe issued.    It was considered that it would be &quot;better an I more effective to deal with the matter hy letters sent to individual firms by the Production Ministries.    This course v/as approvedby the Executive and it was arranged that the letters should be drafted in consultation with the Ministry of Labour and shouldspecify work of special importance which should not be held up.4. In my view, we do not want any more appeals - they havealready been overdone - and I am firmly of the opinion that themost effective way of achieving the object the    Secretary ofState for   War has in view is to adopt the me-thod approved bythe Production Executive,(Intel.)

5,E C g E-T,.T.E. (41)90,.WHIT HOLIDAYS IN 1941.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.1* It was decided by the Production Executive at ameeting cn 22nd April that, subject to unforeseen circumstances,the Whit Monday holiday in England and Wales should not be cancelled nor,  in Scotland,  the Victoria Day holiday, thoughit would he necessary that people engaged on specially urgentproduction or services should work on those days.2. The Secretary of State for War has drawn my special attention to the urgent need during the next three months of amaximum supply of certain types of munition.      In a numberof cases, supply is limited by bottlenecks either in theproduction of the munitions themselves or in the earlier stages of working on the raw materials used.      In these cases, everyday&apos;s work makes a significant difference to the amount that can be produced.3. The need for these munitions is so acute that I feel obliged to ask for very wide application cf the clause in the -decision given by the Production Executive which provides forthe cancellation of the Whit holiday where people are engagedupon specially urgent work,      I should propose to instructfirms and factories engaged on work of this kind that it willnot be possible to suspend production by taking Whit Monday orVictoria Day as a holiday.      The number of workers affected willhe considerable;    and I propose that the factories  atwhich they are employed should be notified of this decisionthrough the Supply Departments rather than by a public announce-ment which would declare our particular shortages and needs.4. But I doubt whether all the workers,  or all the managements, will respond   adequately or willingly, unless they realise more clearly than they appear to do at present the crisis that is upon us,      I should hope,  therefore, that my colleagues will agree that the Prime Minister should be askedto make a public statement at once urging first,   that allengaged in national work should do all they can in these comingtwo or three months to increase output and secondly,  that thosewho are told, through the managements, by the Supply departments of the immediate importance of their particular work for theService Departments, should be asked to forego the Whitsunand Victoria holidays.(initialled)    A.R.D.Ministry of Supply12TH MAY,  1941.
