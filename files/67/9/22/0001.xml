SUPPLY OF MEN FOR THE DEFENCE SERVICES.(Note by Minister of Labour and National Service)The Man-Power Committee have now nearly completed the revision of theSchedule of Reserved Occupations, with a view to releasing from occupationsat present reserved as many men as possible for the defence services.     The&quot;broad results .of ;this revision, representing,, in the main,, agreement betweenthe Ministry of Labour and&apos;the Supply * Departments concerned, .subject toprotests and.-conditions on points of - detail, are described in the Memorandumattached to&apos; this note., setting out a suggested time-table of supply of men forthe defence services and comparing the. supply with the prospective demand ,s.ofar as this is known.     For this purpose, the Navy and Air Force demands havebeen taken as given in the Interim Report of the Man-Power Requirements  .,Committee..     The demand for the Army has&quot;been taken as 900,000 over the&apos; -&apos;. .fifteen months January, &apos; 1941 to March, 1942 inclusive.The Memorandum raises several issues of policy upon which immediate orearly decision by the&apos;War Cabinet. is necessary,  . &apos;.&apos;.&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;&quot;        - - *First, an immediate&apos; decision is needed&apos;as to the Army intake.in the six months April to September, 1941.,   &apos; If this intake can be limited to notmore than .150,000 (&quot;the&apos; actual\-f figure named in the Memorandum&apos; being 150,000),it should be^possible to meet requirements as they- arise to the-end of d941 bythe methods -now contemplated.     If. more&quot;men are allowed for the Army, in thesesix months, it will be impossible to avoid ^i-ther, a dereservation at once ofmen now reserved,, or the calling-up of &quot;the&quot; older age-rgrpups before anysubstantial numbers of younger.men have been-dereserve.d. .

The numbers of men likely to be required cannot be obtainedwithout serious dislocation of vital industries, unless women and older men areavailable in sufficient numbers as substitutes.     Every possible economy ofman-power in the defence services is indispensable,(initd.)   E.B.12th February, 1941.
MEMORANDUM TO NOTE BY MINISTER OFLABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE.1.     The Man-Power Committee have now examined&apos;and-revised the proposals submitted by the Ministry of Labour for change of the Schedule &apos; of; ,Reserved Occupations in, three stages A., B &quot;and&apos; C to come into force at three dates from between how and October, 1941.    While there are manyindividual occupations or groups of occupations upon which agreement hasnot yet been reached, the&apos;general nature of the results of this revisionby the Man-power Sub-Committee- of the Ministry of Labour&apos;s original proposals can be seen,,2.     The broad result, of the - revisions made by the Man-Power Committeeis to reduce the net yield of the &quot;changes in the ages of reservation from about 658,000 in the original scheme of the Ministry of Labour to450,000 now:   a diminution of nearly one third.     The net yield at A is reduced from 98,000 to 70,000, that at B is reduced&apos;from 276,000 to250,000 (130,000 by straight de-reservation and 120,000 in occupationswith two ages of reservation for protected and unprotected work&apos;respectively)&apos;and that, at C from 283,000 to 129,000.r&quot;. &apos; - i .3.    To these net figures should be added the numbers who may be obtainedfrom two Industries which are&apos; being.dealt with specially, namely coal-,mining and,the executive and clerical branches of national Government.The net yield from these,&apos; industries under&apos; the arrangements now ih force is not likely 1 to exceed 20,000 and. may. fall far short of that figure.There are also&apos;the men in hand-at 31st March, 1941 - 100,000 altogetherof whom hardly any are available for. general service in the Army.:;;  the1921 class.,due to register on 22nd February,- 1941, becoming available   &apos;from. 1st&apos;April onwards,,, and expected to yield, 180,000 men as aynet.,,&quot; &apos; &quot;.addition, to. the Forces;   the i903,. 1902 and 1901 classes expected to yield95,000,-,ol4er men;&apos;  .and the 1922 class expected to yield 225,000 men, as&quot;to whose registration no decision has yet been.reached.    The:-. 1921, yearclass, sometimes described as the/,19 year&apos;oids,-&apos; will be from 19?.to..&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;2o5&apos;years old at the earliest date at which they are posted,;.  The 1922class, *if, called up as., suggested below in the last quarter of ,this year,will be aged&apos;from 18^ &quot;to I9f years,. - - .4,    -To reach the net figures from the Schedule changes - a deduction of30 pej: cent, has been made from; the&apos;gross totals. affected by straight&apos;;&apos;&apos; -:.de-reservatldh,. to allow for deferments and men of low medical categories,It has been assumed further that 80 per centv of the men&apos;between the&quot;two. ages of reservation id double-age occupations would be on protectedwork &quot;defer red or, in low medicalcategories&apos;.at the time when list .B comesintp operation&apos;,.:.so that 20 per. cent. Would&apos;become&apos; dereserved and. &quot;be &apos;&quot;available&apos;-as net yield for the defence services,!jfo allowance is has been,made for men changing from one .occupation to another so as, to escape 1 -./dereservation.     It is one-,of, the, objects of notifying the -/Schedulechanges in advance to bring about such movement, and&apos;&quot;swell the , labour      .force in radnitaons.-, .,The resulting loss of men&apos; to &quot;the fighting forcescannot, be. estimated put is&apos; likely to be substantial, .  This leakage by r,. .change of occupation is more than.-.a full set-off against any probable,intake under existing&apos;arrangements from the-industries named in the .last paragraph, and,may exceed that intake many times,  , A margin mustbe provided&apos;to- cover..this contingency. &apos; ... &apos;,&apos; : ....
5.     In considering how far the resources named above will meet therequirements,. regard must be had to the times at which men of the various classes will become available..    The availability of the men to bedereserved by Schedule changes depends oh.the date at which these changescan be published.     Assuming that they are agreed or settled departmentallyby 15th February, and allowing a fortnight as maximum for representations by employers&apos; and employees&apos; associations, publication can be secured by15th March,     With this the date for A dereservation could be fixed for1st April, making the men available for calling-up from two months later,i.e. 1st June.     For list B the corresponding dates should be 1st May and1st July;   for list C they should be 1st August and 1st October.     Thedates1 for the double-age reservations, list (B) depend upon the time taken for preparing the Register of Protected Wox&apos;k.     Assuming publicationof the new Schedule by or before 15th March, and that all the new regional offices of the National Service Department are fully established and the forms printed and distributed by them, it should be possible to complete the. Register and bring dereservation under list (B) into force by 1st June,leading to men being callod-up from 1st August, for everything exceptbuilding;   here a month&apos;s delay, i,e, dereservation as from 1st July,leading to calling-up from 1st September, might be necessary.6,     If these dates, can be adhered to, it will be possible to delay the registration of the 1903, 1902 and 1901 classes to June, 1941, leading tocalling-up as from 1st September.     In that event these older men will notbe. called up till after the A and B lists of the Schedule changes.7.     There remains the 1922 class.     By the last quarter of 1941 theyoungest of these will be l&amp;f- years of age.     It is suggested that theyshould be registered about 1st September, with a view to becoming available about.1st.November. -   If the yield from any of the other sources named ismuch below expectations, it might become necessary to register some atleast of those&apos; men -;say those born in the first half of 1922 - somewhatearlier,    &quot;It..is important that a decision about these men should be taken at once.     If they are to be called on, long notice in advance should begiven, so that the industries which in many cases have taken youths assubstitutes for men in preference to women or older men should prepare todo withcat;-youths.     If the 1922 class are not to;be-called oh this year,it will be necessary either to reduce the intake&apos; of the defence services orto make very damaging farther irroads upon industry by dereservation.     Itis urged that a decision to call the 1922 class before the end of 1941should now be taken.8,     On these lines, the following time-table for supply of men for thedefence services is reached. &quot;*&apos;- &quot;\

How this time-table compares with requirements cannot be stated withany accuracy since the requirements for the Army are not settled.     Butthere are grounds for anticipating a total Army requirement in the fifteen months 1st January, 1941 to 31st March, 1942, of about 900,000 of which113,000 will have been taken in the firsb quarter of 1941 leaving 787,000for the next twelve months.     On this basis Table XVI has been prepared:

10.    In estimating Army requirements, it is necessary to make a distinctionbetween men for general service and service tradesmenf     The practice of theMilitary Recruiting Department has been not to call up for general service menqualified as service tradesmen;   as more men with   such qualifications &quot;havebeen registered than were required as service tradesmen hitherto&apos;, this hasmeant building up a reserve of tradesmen to meet future demands.     Of (the100,000 men in hand at 1st?&apos;April&quot;, 1941. half are ear-marked as such areserve, and as, men are de-reserved, in the coming months, this reserve&apos;will  .increase substantially.     The balancing   of demand and supply of men in theArmy depends very much upon the&apos; QXtant to   which men qualified as: servicetradesmen, but not immediately required in that capacity, are treated ag&apos;available for general   service-11.   Table XVI compares demand and supply of men quarter by quarter to the endof 1941 on the assumption that Army ijfltake is restricted, to ft total of 150,000in the six months April - September, 1943, ? and that the balance ar\th$ 787,000&apos;ife. 657,000 is divided about equally between the last ,quarter of 1941 and .the first quarter of 1942.     It is assumed further/ that the Navy and Air Forcedemands to   the end of 1941 are met in full.     The last two Qoluwh3 showquarterly surpluses or deficiencies, for general service and for sas?via$tradesmen respectively in the Army.     It will be seen that for servicetradesmen there is a substantial surplus in each of the three rejnainingquarters of 1941.     For general service there is a surplus in the second and third quarters of 1941, though   not more than enough to provide a reasonable .margin for contingencies;    in the last quarter of the year, with the &quot;&apos;.increased intake of the Army, there-is a large, deficiency for general&quot;service.Taking the three quarters together, it should be possible to meet Army demandsif men qualified as service tradesmen are posted so far as. necessary forgeneral service.       It will not be possible from the supplies now in prospect,to meet the Army demand in the. first.quarter of 1942, or to meet the demandsof the Navy and Air Force, not reckoned in the Table but certain to continue.To   meet these, even if the 1923 class were called up:,: changes of the schedule of Reserved Occupations, rgoing far beyond those described in the Appendix,will be inevitable. 1 :12.    The problem of meeting requirements in 1942 can perhaps be left for examination later.     Requirements to the end of 1941 can be met by the time-table setout above on the /following conditions:-(a) Calling-up of the 1922 class by about November, 1941.     If thisis not agreed to, drastic further de-reservation must come beforethe last quarter of 1941, i.e. in the third quarter.(b) Restriction of Army intake in the two   quarters April-June and july^September, 1941.     The figures suggested in Table XVI for these   &apos;quarters are 60,000 and   70,000 respectively, or 130,000       . &apos;altogether.     If the full supply shown in Table XV is forthcomingor if men qualified as tradesmen can be posted to general service,this total could be raised a little, say to   150,000.     Butanything beyond involves   further immediate cuts into the reserved Occupations^ &apos;&apos;;     *(c) Immediate settlement of the outstanding points of detail   in the ...--changes of reservation now under discussion, so   that the newSchedule, after (say) a&apos; fortnight has been given to the british employers&apos; Confederation and the Trades Union Congress forrepresentations, can be printed and published by the middle ofMarch,   1941.   .13.    Tv/o observations should be made in conclusion.     The Schedule.changes onwhich the foregoing calculations rest, represent probably the limit of what can be obtained by   agreement,   with or without protest, between   the Ministryof Labour and the Supply Departments.     They   certainly.will not secure,agreement,.of the industries affected-     If the War Cabinet decide thatnumbers to the extent   suggested in Table&quot;: XVI are &apos;indispensable and: must beobtained, at all costs., the only way to gep them is to instruct the Ministry ofLabour through its National Service-&apos; Department to submit -the best possible;scheme for raising those numbers, after consulting other Departments, but notnecessarily in agreement with   them.&apos;     Such   procedure is even more necessary-
H.Q. 261-80 B.K.if the War Cabinet should desire either to secure a more rapidintake into the Army or to avoid calling up the Class of 1922.This is not because, in the discussions of the Man-Power Sub-Committee, the representatives of the Supply Departments have been inany way unreasonable in opposition   to changes of the Schedule.     Onthe contrary, they have approached the problem with great readiness   tocontribute to   the common need.     But it is not possible for those responsible for particular essential supplies to agree to   changes which appear to   involve any risk of diminisliing those supplies.Still less is it possible to prepare a fair scheme of de-reservationby consent of those directly engaged in the various industries.     Itis no more possible to prepare a budget of man-power with the specific consent of the individual interests to be taxed, than itwould be to   prepare   a financial budget in the same way.14.   Second,   the problem of supplying of men for the defence service is intimately linked with   the problem of supplying women both for defence   services   and for civilian employment.     On the   one hand,the defence services are finding great difficulty in obtaining andretaining the numbers of women that they need;   if they fail to doso, they are bound to   use men for work which women could do.     Someof the most urgent demands of the Army for men are for work which iswit tain the capacity of women and would be done by women if they couldbe secured.     On the   other hand, the   possibility of releasing men for defence services without stopping important   production depends inmany cases on the availability of substitutes.     In a number of casesrailway clerks, metal machinists, telephonists and many more - the raising of reservation ages has been accepted by the supply departments concerned only on the understanding that if substitutescannot in   fact be found, deferments   will be granted. r
