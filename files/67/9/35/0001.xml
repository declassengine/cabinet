t George Street, S.W.126th March, 1941.sjnOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)[Q R E. T.Jfl)Ul) 55. COPY NO. tyX,iWAR CABINET.CIVIL SERVICE LEAVE.Note by the Secretary of the War &quot;Cabinet.The Prime Minister has given instructions forthe circulation to the War Cabinet of the attachedNote setting out proposals which, have been made forthe granting of leave this year to the Civil Service.. (Signed) E.E. BRIDGES.

Following upon discussions which have been held with representatives of the Civil Service Staff Side,Sir Horace Wilson has asked for authority to put intoeffect leave arrangements for the coming year whichwould apply generally throughout the Service.Last year there were considerable disparitiesfrom Department to Department, but leave was generallycurtailed and since then there has been a long winterduring which Departments have been under great strain.In the interests of health and efficiency it seemsessential that reasonable leave should be given thisyear even though travelling difficulties mean that itmust be spent at home.      The discussions with the staff side have resulted in proposals (which they accept) that so far as work and circumstances permit - twelve days&apos;leave should be given, as far as possible in one spell,and arranged on a staggered plan.So far as Bank Holidays are cancelled theMinister of Labour&apos;s proposals provide for workpeopleto be given alternative individual days from time totime, so long as there is no interference with production.      The same principle would be applied inthe Civil Service,All leave would be subject to liability tocancellation and staff would be subject to recall ifthe course of events rendered that necessary.
