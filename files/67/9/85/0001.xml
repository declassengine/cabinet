Printed for the  War Cabinet.   August 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 85.August 29, 1941.WAR CABINET.INTERPRETATION OF POINT III OF ATLANTIC declaration in RESPECT OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India and for Burma.IT will be seen from the telegrams appended that Point III of the Eight-Point Declaration has already been fastened upon by the Burman Ministers asan argument for a promise forthwith of full self-government immediately afterthe war, regardless of the actual circumstances either of Burma itself or of theinternational situation. The Viceroy, too, is anxious as to the meaning thatwill be given to Point III by Indian politicians, and would be grateful for an authoritative interpretation of it upon which he can base a reply to enquiries,whether by his Council or leaders of political organisations. This question of interpretation in its application to the component units of the British Empire is certain also to be raised in Parliament, whether by questions or in the course ofdebate on any oral statement that the Prime Minister may make in regard to the eight-Point Declaration when the House meets.As I read it, the Declaration itself, or rather its preamble, makes it clear thatit is a general affirmation of the principles for which we are waging the present war and which we aim to see established in the peace that will follow victory, andthat the object of Point III in particular is simply to give an assurance that wehave no desire to impose against their will, either upon the peoples with whom weare at war or upon those whom we hope to liberate, any particular type of constitution. Though animated by the same spirit of liberty as has guided thedevelopment of self-governing institutions in the British Empire with regardto which both the general aim of our policy and its particular application in thecase of India and Burma has been made abundantly clear it has no directreference to that process.What I would suggest is some slight amplification of the above reading ofPoint III somewhat on the following lines :  &quot; &apos; The Eight-Point Declaration,&apos; or &apos; Atlantic Charter,&apos; is, as is clear from the preamble, a general affirmation of the principles for which we arewaging the present war, and which we aim to see established in the peacethat will follow victory. The object of Point III in particular, in which theDeclaration affirms &apos; the right of all peoples to choose the form of govern-ment under which they will live,&apos; is to give an assurance that we have no desire to impose against their will, either upon the peoples with whom weare at war or upon those whom we hope to liberate, any particular type of constitution. The spirit of liberty and comprehension which it embodiesis, in the context, directed to a specific external object; it is, however,the same as that which has guided and will continue to guide the internalpolicy of the British Empire. Point III introduces no new principle in that respect.[22861] ,b
&quot; The development of self-governing institutions to the fullest practic-able extent within the British Empire has been, and is, our declared policy.The policy is of general application; but the extent to which it can be carriedout in any particular case at any given date must, of course, depend on thespecial circumstances of each case. In the case of the Dominions theprinciple has already attained its fullest fruition. In the case of India weare pledged to help her to obtain the same position of equal freedom in partnership with ourselves. By the Declaration of Policy of August 1940we undertook to implement that pledge so soon after the war as agreement is arrived at between the main elements in India&apos;s national life with regardto the form of her future Constitution, and the subsequent necessary pro-vision made for the due fulfilment of obligations arising from our long-historic connection with India. That declaration did, in fact, not only giveour pledge as to the attainment by India of free self-government in thefullest sense and at the earliest possible moment, so far at any rate as thematter is in our hands, but also dealt on the most generous lines with the specific issue raised by Point III of the &apos; Atlantic Charter &apos; of liberty of choice of the form of Constitution. Similarly, in Burma, the Governor^address to the Legislature on the 26th August, 1940, stated that full self-government, which is the essence of Dominion status^ is the goal for burma as for India, and that the discussions for which we have undertaken to give an opportunity at the end of the war, with regard to an expansion ofthe already extensive measure of self-government already enjoyed by the burmese people, will afford an opportunity to Burmans to devise and propoundamendments of this Constitution suited to what is, in their view, required tomeet their country&apos;s needs.&quot;I understand that the Secretary of State for the Colonies is submitting aseparate memorandum on the interpretation of Point III in its bearing on theColonial Empire.L. S. A.August 29, 1941.
(1) Telegram from Governor of Burma to Secretary of State, dated15th August, 1941.(Most Immediate.)118.   Personal.   Reference my telegram No. 102, personal, dated 31st July.Paragraph 3 of Joint Declaration by Churchill-Roosevelt will be taken hereto apply literally to Burma.2. I shall be meeting Ministers to-morrow (though I quite expect a visitarising out of Declaration from Premier before that) and shall be glad of yourguidance.(2) Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor of Burma, dated15th August, 1941.(Most Immediate.)Addressed Governor of Burma, repeated Viceroy. Personal. Your personal telegram No. 118, dated 15th August.It is obviously impossible to authorise any public and official statementinterpreting point 3 in relation to Burma (or any other particular country) orin any degree whittling away sense of point 3 without approval of Churchill andalso of President. In these circumstances any explanation to your Ministers ofdegree of its relevance to Burma must be in form of your own personal reading of it.2. For this purpose I suggest you might use following as line on which to discuss with Ministers informally :  (a) It is clear from circumstances in which declaration was made that second sentence in point 3 relates to countries which in recent years (not onlysince September 1939, but, for instance, Abyssinia) have been overrunby aggressor nations.(b) It follows from this that first part is disclaimer of any intention such asenemy countries evidently entertain to impose on any nation as partof peace terms of victorious democracies any particular form ofGovernment.(c) All 8 points in the declaration are statements of ultimate purposes to be aimed at when victory has been won. It is dangerous to give anyparticular application to any one of these very general statements(none of which indicates any new policy or differs from what has often been declared by democratic leaders as their ideals). There is, in short, nothing essentially different in point 3 from what was said byHis Majesty&apos;s Government to Burma in paragraph 5 of declarationof 26th August, 1940, by which His Majesty&apos;s Government stand.(d) It is of course absurd to assume that Burma or any other particular unit in the British Commonwealth was in mind when this declaration wasframed, but care should be taken to avoid giving impression thatgeneral principle stated in paragraph 3 will not guide us in dealingwith particular question of constitutional future of Burma (or forthat matter of India) when we tackle that problem in post-war conditions.(3) Telegram from Governor of Burma to Secretary of State, dated16th August, 1941.(Most Immediate.)119.   My most immediate telegram No. 118 of 15th August.1. Tin Tut came to see me to-night at 8 p.m. as emissary of Council ofMinisters. He produced document which Council, after four hours&apos; deliberation,wished to publish to-night.It was in terms as anticipated, i.e., whole-hearted welcome of paragraph 3 ofthe Joint Announcement on the definite assumption that it meant full post-warself-government for Burma.2. I have delayed publication until the 16th, hoping that I will have heard from you, but I find it difficult to see how I can hold this up indefinitely, especially if your reply falls short of their interpretation of the Announcement.[22861] b 2
3. Public will expect some declaration from Ministry and I am advised thatvernacular papers will comment forcibly.4. I do not see how we can compromise on this issue. Only possible alternative to a full-blooded Announcement would be an immediate invitation to premier to visit England specifically to discuss Constitutional questions.5. I should add that Ministers&apos; proposed manifesto promised whole-hearted support to democracies if the Joint Announcement applies literally to Burma.(4) Telegram from Governor of Burma to Secretary of State, dated August 16,1941.(Immediate.)120. Personal. Addressed Secretary of State telegram No. 120 repeatedViceroy telegram No. 46.I am grateful for your personal telegram No. 225, dated 15th August.Premier came to see me this morning to show me statement which Councilof Ministers proposed to issue.  Following was text :-Begins: &quot; The Council of Ministers representing the people of Burma andon behalf of a country containing nearly seventeen million people welcome with enthusiasm the historic Joint Declaration made on 14th August, 1941, by thePresident of the United States of America and Prime Minister of the UnitedKingdom.The principles declared therein constitute, in the opinion of the Council, a charter of liberties for all countries in the World, and, in particular, they welcome the assurance given to the whole World that the Governments of the United Statesand of the United Kingdom respect the right of all peoples to choose the formof government under which they will live, and that they wish to see their soA^ereignrights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived ofthem.The application of the above principles to Burma will fully satisfy politicalaspirations of her people for national freedom, and on the basis that aforesaidDeclaration applies to Burma, the Council of Ministers affirm on behalf of thepeople their adherence to the noble principles which have been declared and their determination to support the Democracies in the task of finally destroying Nazityranny and of establishing a lasting peace.   Ends.2. I spoke to the Premier on the lines you suggested. He told me that hisMinistry had decided to &quot; come off the fence,&quot; and on the basis quoted above togo all out on a full-blooded pro-English policy. He enquired anxiously whether had had any word from you as to whether Burma could consider herselfdefinitely included in point 3. I spoke on lines of your paragraph No. 2 (c), but,as I expected, he did not find the argument very convincing, but he quiteappreciated that nothing could be said about any particular country untilChurchill returned.3. I urged him to delete reference to those who had been &apos;&apos; forcibly deprived of sovereign rights,&quot; as being calculated to arouse bitter feelings. He said that council had taken four hours&apos; deliberation to agree on this communique, butpromised to consult his colleagues.4. Later on this morning I saw Ministers with reference to financial settle-ment over military expenditure and transit duties on goods for China. Detailsabout these discussions follow. In course of a heated discussion Ministersreacted strongly against paying figure suggested to them, and even more stronglyabout reducing transit duties. They began to think that helping Democracieslooked an expensive undertaking and, as I anticipated, expressed doubts as towhether they could lend their support to such proposals without the much askedfor quid pro quo.5. At 4 p.m. the Premier came to see me with a new draft statement textas follows :  Begins: The Council of Ministers, in full knowledge of aspiration of peopleof Burma for national freedom and in full consciousness of their duty towards their country, see in the principles defined in the historic Joint Declaration madeby the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of theUnited Kingdom a charter of liberties for all peoples of the World.
They cannot help but conclude from the universality of the expressions usedin the Declaration, and from the clear and unequivocal language of it, that theprinciples declared thereby must have application to the people of Burma andthat their (? acceptance) by Democracies must of necessity lead Burma to attain-ment of national freedom.The Council, on behalf of the people of Burma whom they represent,accordingly welcome the Declaration with enthusiasm and affirm their adherence to the noble principles defined therein.  Ends.I asked him why he had altered the previous one so dramatically. He saidthat he had had a further three hours&apos; talk with his colleagues and they had decided that after all they could not come entirely off the fence. He argued thatif he committed himself even as far as in the first draft and then found that i could give him no assurances which Burma would consider satisfactory, he might find himself compelled to react forcibly. Therefore at this stage Ministers pre-ferred a statement merely welcoming the Declaration.6. In your telegrams you say that (;? Declaration) contains nothing new.That is true, but it will be very hard to persuade Burma that a Declaration ofapparently universal application made by Churchill and Roosevelt together mustbe limited in its application to Burma by previous statements made by theGovernor. View has been expressed to me that although obviously Burma inparticular cannot have been in Churchill&apos;s mind, neither can exclusion of.Burmahave been intended. Burma will ask whether this great charter of liberty is toapply to all nations save those which happen to be subjects of the British Crown,and if the answer is that that is right interpretation, then they will have quite a lot to say about British justice, &amp;c.7. I am sorry to press this matter so continuously, but I am sure that youwill understand that importance of Declaration lies in fact that it was made bythe two biggest men in the World. If, as far as Burma is concerned, we stillmaintain the old standpoint, the Declaration will, in (? fact), make it infinitelymore difficult to get co-operation from Ministers, and that is not an entirelysimple task even now.8. I have been informed that a telegram is on its way to you fromOpposition members of Legislature asking Churchill to say if point 3 of delclaration applies to Burma.
