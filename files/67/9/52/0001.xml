Printed for the War Cabinet.  May 1941.SECRET.W.P. (G) (41) 52.May 24, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.REFORM OF THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.LAST January I asked Sir Malcolm Robertson, M.P., formerly His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Buenos Aires, to examine on my behalf various suggestions whichhad recently been made for changes and reforms in the Diplomatic Service, and tosuggest any other reforms which he thought advisable.2. In bringing Sir Malcolm Robertson&apos;s report to the attention of mycolleagues, I should like to emphasise that the basis of all reform in the diplomatic service must be to ensure that the Service is staffed by men who are personallysuitable for their work, for in no other career perhaps is the personal element so important, just as in no other career is it given in the same degree to an individualto maike or mar the relations between his country and another.3. There is no doubt that the nature of a diplomats work is changing tosome degree and that men with different qualifications and training are requiredto cope with present-day conditions. I have for some time felt that a measure of reform is necessary if the Diplomatic Service is-to be able to deal adequatelywith present and post-war conditions. The Service should be recruited from a wider field and so become more representative of this country as a whole.4. It was for these reasons that I asked Sir Malcolm Robertson to look intothe matter. I agree with his recommendations and am anxious to give earlyeffect to them. The recommendations do not profess to be exhaustive and someof them, such as the amalgamation of the Diplomatic and Consular Services, canonly take effect after the war and apply to future entrants. The majority willalso require working out in detail, with which I need not trouble my colleagues.But I should like to obtain their approval for the general line which I propose totake and their consent to those reforms which require legislation and those which require the immediate expenditure of public money.5.   These are : (i) The introduction of a pensions scheme enabling the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to retire on a pension proportionate to his service,a man of the rank of First Secretary or Consul and above, who hasshown himself to be unsuited for the highest posts. Twenty years agoit could have been argued with some plausibility that there were postswhere such men could be placed without serious risk to the publicinterest. To-day this is not arguable. There are few posts which arenot or may not become of first-class importance.11384   [22545] copy No.
I would ask my colleagues to agree that, pending the introductionof a pensions scheme applicable to a reorganised and self-containedForeign Service, I should have power to retire on pension men who arev       unfitted for the higher posts. r.;(ii) A system of entry which will enable young men who cannot affordspecialised study to get the training necessary for their career, andso widen the field of entry into the Service. Such a system cannot beintroduced until examinations begin again after the war, but I shouldbe grateful for authority to proceed at once to work out a scheme onthe lines proposed.(iii) Financial arrangements, such as those suggested by Sir M. Robertson,to be introduced as soon as possible so that the best man can be sentto any vacant post.(iv) I also attach importance to our diplomats abroad being sufficientlynumerous, well paid, and well housed to be able adequately and effectively to represent this country. In this connexion I have been impressed by Lord Willingdon&apos;s report on the shortcomings of ourrepresentation in South America. Many of these shortcomings derive from lack of funds, and I hope that early steps may be taken toimprove the position.6. I am confident that the expenditure involved by these reforms will bely compensated by the increased efficiency of the Service.A. E.Foreign Office, May 24, 1941.
REPORT BY SIR MALCOLM ROBERTSON ON THE REFORM OF the diplomatic SERVICE.Introduction.IN a letter of the 24th January, 1941, I was requested by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to examine various suggestions which had from timeto time been put forward for changes and reforms in the Foreign Office and diplomatic Service, with a view to increasing the efficiency of our representationabroad and the confidence of the public in it; to investigate the desirability of introducing any of these changes and reforms; to suggest any others I consideredadvisable, and to report to the Foreign Secretary.I have interpreted my instructions as applying primarily to the diplomatic and Consular Services,,and I have not attempted to recommend reforms in theForeign Office except in so far as these will be necessitated by my proposals forthe other Services.Before proceeding to detailed recommendations, I fear that it is necessaryfor me to begin by explaining the principles which have guided me as well as my own views of the duties of members of the Foreign Service, both at home, andabroad, and the qualifications that should be required of them. These views are based on a long experience and study of diplomacy in many parts of the world and the conviction that it is an art which needs both experience and aptitude.It is, to my mind, insufficient to state, as has been stated, that &quot; The functionsof the Foreign Service abroad are : 1. Representation.2. Information.3. Centre for British interests abroad.4. Miscellaneous.&quot;There are a number of &quot; imponderables &quot; behind all this which it is verydifficult to put into words.It is, I feel, of the first importance that a diplomat abroad should have thequalities and training which will enable him easily to place himself in touch withthe Government and people of the country in which he is exercising his functions. He must have a real knowledge of their psychology and be able toestimate the character of Foreign Ministers and other diplomats with whom hehas to deal. This to me is fundamental. Without these qualities and training,while he may have much economic, financial, labour, military, naval or. airknowledge, he will be unable to carry out his main duties which are, surely, oftwo kinds :  ; Firstly, he must be able to appreciate and explain to the Foreign Office and,through it, to other Government Departments, not only the policy and general attitude of the Government to which he is accredited, but also the state of publicopinion and its importance or otherwise in influencing Government action. Inthe event of instructions being issued to him by the Secretary of State, not onlyon major questions but also on some minor ones, which he feels would have no chance of acceptance at his post, he should be able to give considered reasons whynot. If the Secretary of State insists, the diplomat must carry out his instruc-tions to the best of his ability, but he can only do this if he knows the country towhich he is accredited and its governing circles and is able, through thatknowledge, to make the best of a difficult job. He must be sensitive to publicopinion and really know the country&apos;s leaders, and these are things which noamount of knowledge on specialised subjects will help him to do. Some are bornwith the instinct for this highly important function of the. diplomat. Othersacquire it through experience. To my mind it is wholly incredible that there,should be any suggestion in serious quarters that this can be done without someknowledge of the language of the country.[22545] b 2
Secondly, a diplomat mast be able to explain to the people and members ofthe Government, amongst whom he is carrying out his duties, the policy of hisown Government and public opinion in his own country, and to make it clear to them, when necessary, why particular lines of policy have no chance of accept-ance in the British Empire. For this, he can rely for guidance on the Secretaryof State, other Cabinet Ministers, Members of Parliament and business circleswith whom he should be in close touch, but, here also, he must have the rightinstinct. Even in the House of Commons there are numbers of Members who havebut a very vague idea of the state of public opinion outside their ownconstituencies.As regards the Foreign Office, the qualifications required are different.Heads of departments and Under-Secretaries no doubt frequently interviewforeign representatives in London, but their knowledge of the foreign countries with which they deal need not be personal, though that would be useful. It isfor them to co-ordinate information received from His Majesty&apos;s Representa-tives abroad, to minute papers partly in accordance with such information, andto advise the Secretary of State accordingly. It is also for them to draft or to supervise the drafting of instructions to diplomats. Inter-departmental consulta-tion and representation of the Foreign Office at those consultations is also animportant part of their duties.I think that it will hardly be disputed by anyone of experience that it is not-at all impossible that a man might be a first-class head of a department, Under-Secretary or even Head of the Foreign Office, and yet be a lamentable failure asHead of a Mission abroad.  The converse is equally true.I feel a great responsibility in making the recommendations which will befound below and deeply honoured that the Secretary of State should haveentrusted me with this important enquiry into the Service, which has been themain interest of my life and the future of which is vital to the well-being and security of the British Empire.Recommendations.I. The essential basis of all my recommendations is the constitution of a self-contained and separate Foreign Service distinct, as are the Fighting Services andthe Colonial Service, from the Home Civil Service. The functions of the home civil Service are essentially different from those of the Foreign Service as theyare chiefly administrative in character.II. The Amalgamation of the Foreign Office and Diplomatic service with the Consular Service.I have, I need hardly say, given the most careful consideration to this mostimportant and contentious question. I have studied various reports, includingespecially that of the Committee appointed by the Secretary of State inJune 1938, to examine into it. I have had considerable discussions with membersof the three Services, as well as with representatives of the Press and business,and persons in other walks of life. I think I can say that I have given full consideration to all the arguments for and against amalgamation which have beenput before me, and as a result have arrived at the conclusion that the time hasnow come for the amalgamation of the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service andthe Consular Service, though not of the Commercial Diplomatic Service. I shallrevert to the last-named later on.While I agree with those who feel that in the majority of cases, though by nomeans in all, the functions of a Consular Officer differ from those of a DiplomaticOfficer, this difference appears to be diminishing, and while I do not myself thinkthat there is anything of vital importance which a Diplomatic Officer could learnat a Consular post, more especially in.the junior ranks, which he could not betterlearn at a diplomatic mission, a Consular Officer frequently has earlierindependence and responsibility which may be useful. I find, however, that thereis widely spread in the Consular Service and among the outside public a feeling that this Service is looked upon as inferior both in functional and social status.It will be generally admitted that when this war is over we shall have to makeyet another determined and imaginative effort to re-establish our economic
position throughout the world, and to maintain our political influence. In so faras our Foreign Service is concerned, it seems to me to be essential that it should all work together in&quot; closest harmony and that no section of it should have anyjustification for feeling that it was regarded as of inferior standing either inthe Service itself or outside it. I regard this as of vital importance for thefuture.I also recommend that the new Foreign Service should have its ownsubordinate staff separate from that of the Home Civil Service and liable for service abroad as well as at home.A further point is that the Personnel Department and the AppointmentsBoard which I am proposing to set up will, with the amalgamated Services, havea far wider choice of officers from whom to choose when making recommendations to the Secretary of State for higher appointments. In practice, I hope, the personnel Department, who will know the record and capabilities of every memberof the Service, will find that certain officers will be more suitable for ultimateand more permanent employment in the Foreign Office, the Diplomatic Service,or the Consular Service as the case may be, and will be guided in their recommendations accordingly. The stigma, however, of inferiority, which I am satisfied exists, will be removed. Everyone will be given a fair chance by anindependent Department or Board, and will have no just cause for complaintwhatever post he may be called upon to occupy.The maintenance of contact with London is essential if members of theForeign Service are effectively to represent their country, and arrangements mustbe made for this (a) by reducing the number of the salaried Consular posts, and(b) by having extra posts in the Foreign Office and, if necessary, in other Govern-ment Departments, such as the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour, inwhich men could serve at home even for a short time.III. Administration.To administer this combined Service a permanent Personnel Department inthe Foreign Office will be essential. This Department would make juniorappointments and transfers up to and including the rank of First Secretary, butfor senior appointments and transfers it would make recommendations to anAppointments Board which would sit under the chairmanship of the permanent under-Secretary of State, and consist, besides, of the Deputy Under-secretary in charge of Administration, two former senior members of the Service, and theHead of the Personnel Department. The Board would make its recommendations to the Secretary of State. It will be necessary to institute a system of inspection of all missions and consulates at frequent intervals. All members of the Servicehome on leave or transfer should be instructed to report to the Department, andall heads of Missions and Consulates should make to it annual reports on their staffs. Members of the Personnel Department should be changed every few yearsso as to reduce the possibility of prejudice to the minimum and prevent the domination of the Department by any one individual. A deputy Under-Secretaryof State should take charge of this Department and of all questions concerningthe administration of the Foreign Service and security. The Permanent Under-Secretary should be relieved of all administrative duties, as his main functionshould be that of Chief Diplomatic Adviser to the Secretary of State.IV. Entry.The problem is to lay down conditions of entry which would enable men whohave not the means for specialised study after leaving school or university tooffer themselves as candidates, and thereby to widen the field from whichcandidates can be drawn, without at the same time unduly lowering the standardof entry or relaxing the requirements calculated to secure for the Service the sort of man needed to represent The King and His Majesty&apos;s Government inforeign countries. What it is required to produce in candidates with sufficientintelligence and application to be good officials, with a knowledge of foreigncountries and of their history and languages, with ability to understand and get on with their fellow-men wherever they may be, and enough character to upholdthe British point of view.  In short, a system of entry is needed which will widen
the field from which candidates are chosen without abandoning that special knpw-ledge required for a foreign service or ignoring the need for personality as wellas intelligence.. .    . ...For this purpose I consider that, in addition to the intangible qualities whichcan be summed up in the word &quot; personality,&quot; a knowledge of foreign languages,of history, of economic geography and of general economics is essential. I do notconsider that the present examination, which is assimilated to that for the home civil Service, ensures the necessary qualifications and knowledge.I therefore recommend (i) The abolition of the present preliminary selection board,(ii) The opening of entry to any man in his 22nd or 23rd year (being aBritish .subject in the sense of the present regulations governingentry into the Diplomatic and Consular Services) who has passed an examination of a standard equal to that of a Third or, possibly, SecondClass Honours degree at Oxford University.(iii) That these candidates should appear before a selection board appointedby the Secretary of State and sitting under the chairmanship of the under-Secretary for Administration, and comprising six othermembers, three being past or present members of the Service and three members of the House of Commons of different political parties,nominated by the leaders of the parties at the request of the Secretaryof State. This board should select a number of candidates 50 per cent,in excess of the fixed number of vacancies which may be expected to beabout twenty every year.(iv) That for a period of one year at least (I should prefer two years) these30 (or so) candidates should be treated as probationers, be grantedscholarships and be required to learn two European languages and to study history, economic geography and general economics.(v) That, at the end of this period, candidates should go up for a written examiniation in the above subjects in order that the twenty best may be chosen for the Service.(vi) That, in order to maintain the necessary flow of experts in Eastern and far Eastern affairs a certain number of the candidates should beinvited to volunteer for service in the Near or Far East on the under-standing that a large part of their careers, though by no means thewhole, will be spent in those parts.V. Expert Advisers.I have indicated above that I did not consider that the CommercialDiplomatic Service should be amalgamated with the Foreign Office, diplomatic and Consular Services.  My reasons are as follows : In a number of papers that I have read and in a number of oral representa-tions which have been made to me, great but, to my mind, not too great stress hasbeen laid on the crucial importance of our future economic policy, which must bea governing factor in the whole of our Foreign Policy throughout the world. Ithas been urged that diplomats should, early in their career, serve either atConsular posts so as to get practical commercial experience or serve for someunspecified time in the Board of Trade. I cannot agree that this would serve anypermanently useful purpose. The knowledge and experience of economic problems, even of our gigantic export and import trade which is only one side ofthem, would be of too scanty a nature to stand the diplomat in good stead in the later stages of his career. To attain an expert knowledge would, in the greatmajority of cases, require so much study and time that the diplomat would beleft with little opportunity to learn the art of his profession on Avhich I have sostrongly insisted in my opening remarks. There is no reason in itself why an expert on trade and economics should make a greater success of his dealing withforeign governments and peoples than an expert in finance, labour matters,military, naval or air matters. I hold strongly, and repeat, that diplomacy is aprofession of its own kind, and that, as a general rule, it requires practice and experience as well as instinct.
Heads of Missions abroad will, in future, require expert advice on a numberof subjects. Economics is but one of those subjects, though possibly the mostimportant. Finance is another. Labour is a third. Military, naval and airmatters will always be of governing importance in Foreign Affairs. It can surelybe argued with force that some of the alleged failures of our diplomacy duringthe last few years were due in a large measure to the numerical weakness of ournavy, army and air forces.After very careful consideration I have arrived at the conclusion that in theworld as it is constituted to-day, the Head of a Mission should be surroundedby a body of experts besides having his own purely diplomatic staff. These expertsshould consist of (1) an Economic and Commercial Adviser, (2) a financial adviser, (3) a Labour Adviser, (4) possibly a Press Adviser, though I am very doubtful indeed whether the influencing of the local press is properly the function of a Diplomatic Mission. The study of the local press both daily andperiodical, and contact with foreign and British press representatives should beentrusted to the Diplomatic Staff as one of their most important functions.(5) A Military Attache, (6) a Naval Attache, (7) an Air Attache.In the smaller Missions so large a staff would not, of course, be necessary.I fully appreciate the importance of securing for our diplomats such training and experience as is possible in all the more technical fields of a Mission&apos;s work&apos;.I have therefore included the study of these questions in the candidates&apos; periodof probationary study, and I recommend that a diplomatic secretary should beattached to the commercial, financial and labour sections of Missions wheneverthis is practicable, though I recognise that this may involve larger staffs. the experts and the majority of their staffs should be provided by the appropriateGovernment Department. In the case of the Labour Adviser, I suggest that theTrades Union Congress should be consulted as Well as the Ministry of Labour.VI. Experts in Eastern Affairs.I am very much concerned about the provision of officers with a specialisedknowledge of the Far East and the Middle would recommend that close touch be kept with the Colonial and Sudan Services, which might, in case of &apos;necessity, be able to recommend suitable candidates for higher posts in those areas.Men should be encouraged to learn oriental languages by substantial languagegrants and by up-grading certain eastern posts, such as the Consulate-general at Shanghai, for pay and pension purposes, to the status of a Legation.VII. Languages.I regard a knowledge of the language of the country in which a man servesas of the greatest importance, and all members of the Foreign Service shouldbe required to learn the language as soon as they arrive at a foreign post. Ateacher of the local language might be attached to every Mission.VIII. Financial.In the course of my investigations I have been much struck by obstacles inthe way of an efficient service which are created by (a-) the slowness of promotionin the lower ranks, and (6) the difficulty of eliminating officials, who proveunsuitable.(a) If the Service is to function with the fullest efficiency, it should bepossible to secure the best man for any particular job. So long as it takes amember of the Diplomatic Service, as it now does, ten years or more to rise abovethe Assistant Principals rate of pay ( 275- 625) no man can hope, if he ismarried, to live easily at home let alone to maintain those contacts which arenecessary if he is to pull his full weight as a representative of this country whenhe goes abroad again. I have been impressed by the number of instances broughtto my notice when it has proved impossible to bring home a man, for the job forwhich he was most fitted, because he could not afford to live in London. Thisslow promotion, moreover, discourages entry into the Service, particularly whenit is seen That promotion in the earlier stages of the Home Civil Service is considerably quicker.   With a combined Service the periods during which a man
serves at home will be fewer than they are for the present Diplomatic and ForeignOffice staff. While this will lessen the financial hardship falling on individuals,it will make it all the more important that London should be treated as a postjust like Paris or Washington and that, as is now the case with members of the consular Service posted to London, men serving in this country should receiverates of pay or allowances sufficient to enable the Secretary of State to move any man. however small his means, to any post for which he is particularly suited.An alternative would be the establishment of a fund which would enable theSecretary of State to supplement, on the recommendation of the PersonnelDepartment, the pay of a man whom it would not otherwise be possible to send to a particular post.(&amp;) The members of the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service numberedbefore the war just over 200. A combined Diplomatic and Consular Servicemight number 500 or 550. It will then be easier indeed this is one of thereasons for amalgamation to find the right man for any particular post. but some men, particularly in a foreign Service, are bound to develop shortcomingsand idiosyncrasies which render them unsuited to fill the higher posts in theForeign Service, and particularly to represent&apos; The King and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment abroad. In a large service like the Home Civil Service anidhe can generally be found for men who, while possessing other qualities, wouldnot do as representatives abroad. In the present Diplomatic Service a man cannot,except on medical grounds and in certain rare exceptions, be retired on a pensionuntil he is 60. In the case of a man who has committed no fault meriting dismissalbut has merely shown himself unsuited to fill the higher posts in the foreign service, the Secretary of State is faced with the dilemma of leaving himwithout pay or pension until he is 60 or keeping him on to the detriment of ourrepresentation. Although it will be easier, with a combined service, to findsquare holes for square pegs, I am convinced that the Foreign Service will notbe as efficient as we all desire until the Secretary of State (who already has thepower to place a man en disponibilite without pay) is able to retire, on the pensionproportionate to his term of service, any man, of First Secretary&apos;s rank orupwards, who is judged by the Appointments Board to be unsuited to fill thehigher posts. No man should be allowed to retire on a pension of his own freewill unless he has had 30 years&apos; service.If the argument were advanced that such a scheme would not be fair to theremainder of the Civil Service, the obvious reply surely is that the same rules should be established for other Government Departments. I oan see no adequateargument for keeping unsuitable officials in any department of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment just because there is no provision for pensioning them off before they can clog the wheels of State.MALCOLM A ROBERTSON.May 12, 1941.
