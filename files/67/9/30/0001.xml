SECRET.W.P.(G)(4l)  50 COPY NO.WAR CABINET    -CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES IN JAMAICA.Memorandum by the    Secretary of State for the Colonies.Certain constitutional changes must be made in Jamaica.These have been discussed with Sir Arthur Richardss the Governor9during his recent visit to this country.      As the proposals are of unusual importance I should-be glad of Cabinet approval to their publication.      I attach a brief memorandum which covers the main points5  (Annex l) and a draft despatch setting out theproposals in full (Annex II).The West India Commission heard a good deal of evidence on constitutional questions and we reported that the objectof policy should be the introduction of universal adult suffrage.We were not able to generalise as to the speed at which thechange should be carried out.      The interest in this questionvaries very much among the Colonies and in some cases publicopinion would certainly be satisfied if the franchise were extended.by gradual changes after examination by local committees.Jamaicao howeverg stands alone in the interest which is takenin this matter.      The poeple are much more in touch withcoloured elements in the United States9 Cuba etc.  and thereis no doubt that the concessions while probably making no difference to the present type of representative, will do muchto allay political agitation.The social services in Jamaica are very unsatisfactory and this is partly due to the bad state of local government.It is proposed that the parliamentary representatives shouldbe made responsible in each county for local administration and this should not only offer a useful training in politicalresponsibility but also create machinery for better administration the third main point that I would specially mention isthat the Governor should be relieved from presiding over theLegislative Council.      Besides wasting much time it subjectshim to humiliation and insults which are not consistent withhis position as representing the Crown.The Governorj who has now returned to the Island9 is anxious to make a public statement regarding the changes assoon as may be.      He would lay the despatch before the existingLegislative Council,  and give them an opportunity fordiscussion.(Intld.) M.Colonial Office,6th March,  1941.-1-

annex i.the constitution of jamaica,In the last few years there has grown up inJamaica a demand, for a reform of the constitution to enablethe people to take a greater part in the business ofGovernment 9In Jamaica there is a Legislative Council consistingof the Governor as President, 5 ex-officio members, notexceeding 10 nominated members, and 14 elected members.Property qualifications are required both for membership ofthe Council and for the right to vote.The present population of Jamaica is approximately,250,000.      ,,t the last election about 5,5% of thepopulation had a vote.The Governor of Jamaica has submitted proposalsfor reform based on the recommendations of the West IndiaRoyal Commission.      These proposals were discussed with himwhen he was recently in this country and as a result thefollowing changes are recommended,(l)    Universal adult suffrage0(2)    An enlarged Legislative Council to compriseapproximately double the present numberof Elected Members., with Nominated members and 3 (instead of 5)  ex-officio Members,the total number to be not less than 40.Two difficulties in carrying out these changes are the low standard of local government and the absence oftrustworthy statistics of population.      It is proposed to request the Governor to re-organize the local government andto carry out a census.      Until this is done,  and elections are held on the new franchise, the reconstitute ion of theLegislative Council cannot take place.There are,  however, changes that can be made forthwith:Official representation in the Legislative Councilto be confined to the Colonial Secretary,  the Treasurer andthe Attorney General,,.     Resulting vacancies to be filled by nominations in which care is taken to ensure that all important sections and interests of the community receiveadequate representation.Concurrently with the reduction of the officialrepresentation the Governor&apos;s powers to be in some degreeenlarged, but the special powers of veto at present held by the elected Members to be retained.      The Governor!s over-ridingpowers would be sufficient to carry any measure consideredexpedient in the interests of public order, public faith,or good government.If these changes are accepted hy the LegislativeCouncil of Jamaica it is proposed that the Governor should withdraw from the Presidency of the Council and be replaced by a Speaker who would bo appointed by the Governor in thefirst instance and later be elected by the Council subject topresentation to the Governor for approval.

Sir,I have the honour to address you on the subjectof the constitution of Jamaica.2, During your visit to this country ithas been possible to discuss with you various suggestions which have been made from time to timefor changes in the constitution, with special reference to the relevant recommendations of theWest India Royal Commission.3. I set out below the changes in the Islandconstitution which appear to me desirable and whichI trust may prove acceptable.      In some respectsimmediate action can be taken:    in others,  for reasons I shall outline,  it can not.      Nevertheless,in the last-named cases,  I shall suggest measureswhich,  though intended as temporary,  are in line with the recommendations of the West India Royal Commissionand should go some way to smooth the working of theconstitution in the immediate futiirch..- The Royal Commission recommended that universaladult suffrage should be the object of policy, but did not agree as to the speed at which this change should be applied..      In the case of Jamaica theLegislative Council resolved in December, 1938:-&quot;That in the opinion of this Council the Voters&apos;List should be amended so as to provide foruniversal suffrage,&quot;I am prepared to agree that Jamaica should be granteduniversal adult suffrage and I see no reason why thisshould not be embodied as an integral part of theimmediate changes which I shall propose..5. It appears to be generally agreed that theLegislative Council should be enlarged andremodelled.      I am prepared to give favourable consideration to a new model which would compriseapproximately double the present number of elected members and also of Nominated Members,  togetherwith a reduced number of Ex-Officio members  (onthe lines recommended by the West India RoyalCommission) making a total of not less than forty.Any member of the Legislative Council would havepower to initiate legislation except on financial matters.

In oar-ryiixg out this change, however,there are two main difficulties.      The first is that every sound central administration must rest upona sure basis  of local government.      It will, 1*think, he generally agreed that parochial governmentin Jamaica has lag&apos; ed &quot;behind the times  and,  accordingto modern standards,  cannot be regarded as fullerefficient.      In saying this I do not wish to he understood as directing any special reproach againstJamaica.      It is only in recent years that what Ihave said above on the subject of local governmenthas been generally accepted.      I should wish you to take in hand at an early date the reform of localgovernment:    and this is a matter in which I have every confidence the Elected Members will he willingand glad to oo-opcrate with you,The second is the  aosence of trustworthyststistics of population (see recommendation No.32of the West India Royal Commission.)      I considerthat a census should he taken in Jamaica at  anearly date,  and I have under consideration themaking of a scheme under the Colonial development and Welfare Act 19u1 for&apos;this purpose.6, For the reasons outlined above, there-constitution of the Legislative Council proposed above must await the reform of local government, the census,  and the holding of elections on the newfranchise,  if that is accepted.7* But,  as I have indicated above, there are other changes which could be made forthwith.      TheRoyal Commission have recommended (28(c)) thatofficial representation in Legislative councils should he confined to the Colonial Secretary, theTreasurer and the Attornejr General.      This changehas already been made in certain other legislative councils in the West Indies and I am prepared to agreethat a similar change should he introduced in Jamaica,It is understood that the resulting vacancies will be filled hy nominations in which care is taken to ensurethat all important sections and interests of thecommunity receive adequate representation.      It isalso understood that nominated members will votefreely according to their own convictions.I have noted above that in certain otherLegislative assemblies in the West Indies officialrepresentation has been similarly reduced.Concurrently, however,  extended powers have beengiven to the Governor.      In the present constitutionof Jamaica there are certain peculiarities existing inno other Colony.      On the one hand the Governor hasthe power of &quot;paramount importance&quot; provided inGlauses 1+3 and I4I4. of the Order-in-Gouncil of 1882+ asamended hy the Order-in-Oouncil of 189.5:    on the other the elected Members have the powers laid down in the sameclauses, notably the &quot;power of the nine&quot;.      Both ofthese powers have formed the subject of criticism andcontroversy.      In the immediate changes  at present contemplated I do not propose that the powers vested in-the Elected Members Should be. in any way altered:    hut

I regard, it as essential that concurrently with thereduction of official membership of the LegislativeCouncil the powers of the Governor should be more clearly defined, and in some degree enlarged.      Ipropose that the Governor&apos;s powers should be defined as follows:-&quot;If the Governor shall consider that it is expedient in -the interests of public order, publicfaith or good government (which expressions shall,without prejudice to their generality, include theresponsibility of the Colony as a component partof the British Empire,, and all matters pertainingto the appointment, salary and other conditions ofservice of any public officer or officers) that any bill introduced-, or any motion, resolution or voteproposed for decision in the Council should haveeffect,  then,  if the Council fail to pass such bill,,motion? resolution or vote within such time and insuch form as the Governor may think reasonable andexpedient, the Governor at any time within his discretion may, notwithstanding any provisions ofthis Order-in-Council or of the Orders-in-Council1884 and 1895 or any Orders amending those Orders,or of any Standing Rules or Orders of the Council,declare that such bill, motion, resolution or voteshall have effect either in the form In which it was so introduced or proposed or with such amendments ashe shall think fit which shall have been moved orproposed, in the Council or in any committee thereof,and thereupon the same shall have effect-, as if ithad been passed by the Council, and in the case ofany such bill the provisions contained in this Order-In-Council as to assent to bills and disallowance ofOrdinances shall apply accordingly. &quot;8e      .        If these proposals are accepted,  I. am pre-pared to recommend that the Governor should withdraw from the Presidency of the Legislative Council andthat in his place there should be a Speaker.     In thefirst instance I propose that the Speaker should beappointed by the Governor; but I am prepared at a later stage to consider his election by the Council subject tothe usual provision for his presentation to the Governorfor approval.      The question of payment of a salary tothe Speaker is one which I should wish you to discuss with the Elected and Nominated Members.-I propose that officials, other than ex-officio Members, should be permitted to be present at meetings of the Councilf when necessary, and to address the Council, but not to be regarded as members for the purpose of voting.I am also prepared to approve of the payment to members of the Council, both Elected and Nominated,of a fixed consolidated travelling allowance in placeof the present variable travelling allowance.I request that you will place the proposals in this despatch before the Legislative Council andreport to me in due course the Council&apos;s views with your recommendations,I have,  etc.
