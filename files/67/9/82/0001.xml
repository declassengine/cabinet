SECRET,W.P.(G)(Ul)  82.  - Copy No,   \   \27th August,  19iq.. TO CABINET.CEYLON CONSTITUTION.-. Memorandum by the Secretary of State- - for the Colonies..     &apos; &apos;In November 1938, Mr.&apos; MacDonald submittedrecommendations to the Cabinet relating&apos; to the reform ofthe  constitution of Ceylon,      The Governor had made certain proposals for reform, ana Mr. MacDonald sought theauthority of the Cabinet, for publishing these and arranging for them to be debated in the State Council of ceylon,     The intention was that, if general opinion wasin favour of the principles of the proposals, an amendingOrder-in-Council should at once be&apos; drafted for puttingthem into effect.      T-he,&amp;e re commendations were approvedby the Cabinet.-   2,      The . Governor&apos; s proposals were debated at length in the State Council, but resulted in a pronouncedfailure of the representatives of the Sinhalese majority-community and those of the minority communities (ceylon and Indian Tamils, Burghers, Moslems and &quot;Europeans) toreach any basis of agreement.      Further examination ofthe problem was interrupted by the outbreak of war.There has followed a kind of informal political truce on.this subject between the communities in Ceylon, and thelocal advocacy of communal claims has not been publiclypressed,  though there is no reason to doubt that theywould appear with no loss of virulence if opportunity-were given.      To avoid this, the life of the state council, v/hich should have -expired not later thanJanuary 19hl, was prolonged by Order in Council lastyear for a period up to two years - ostensibly toprovide further time to consider the question of constitutional reform.3.      It lias become increasingly clear that ase ttlement - cannot be satisfactorily carried out untilthe war is over.      In view of the opposition of the minorities to the recent proposals, I do not see how anysubstantial reforms can be brought into force until there has been a further examinetion of the whole position either by a commission sent to Ceylon,  or bythe -summoning of a conference in Ceylon or, preferably,in London.     Neither of these courses is feasible inpresent conditions..      Moreover, it would be difficultduring
during trie war to carry into effect further substantialadvances in the already advanced constitution of ceylon, if in India and in. Burma the lines of constitutional progress are. not to be settled untilthe war is over.      A decision by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to reform the Ceylon constitution in anyother direction than that of. increased, powers forthe Ceylon Ministers and elected representatives would be  in conflict with reasonable expectationsand would confront us with very serious reactions in the Island. &apos;ho     The Governor reports that there is some -deterioration in the local political position andthat the present State Council is getting stale.Even so,  I feel that there are greater objections toattempting to reform the constitution now than to allowing it to operate a little longer.      At presentcommunal feeling, is not asserting itself in thepolitical field, and the Governor has powers under defence Regulations which he can and does exercise toensure necessary executive action in matters arisingout. of defence re quire men tsj    whereas the knowledge that the reform of the constitution was under activeexamination would at once  intensify public expressions of communal feeling,  and might lead in &quot;pre sent conditioto a difficult problem of law and order in the island&quot;with some rea.cti.ons even in political circles    in India.5o      I propose therefore to instruct the governor to issue  to the Ministers in Ceylon the following statement which has been provisionally agreed with theGovernor.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under furtherconsideration the question of constitutional refon.-.  in CeylonThe urgency and importance of the reform of the constitution is fully &quot;recognised by-   His Majesty.&apos;s Government, but before taking.- -   decisions upon the present proposals for reform,concerning which there- has been so little unanimitbut which are of such importance to the well-being of Ceylon, His Majesty&apos;s Government would desire  x&quot;.. that the position should he further examined and-/&quot;&apos;&apos;    made the  subject of further consultation by means da commission or conference,     The Board of Minister. will appreciate that this cannot, be arranged under. war conditions, but the matter will be taken up witthe. least possible delay-after the war.&quot;This announcement would be -intended for publication in tState Council by arrangement with the Ministers and woulbe published in this country at the  same time.      If theBoard, of, Ministers wished to suggest-any amendment ofthe form. or. terms of. the statement before its publicatioI should be ready, to agree -provided that it were not substantially altered.- -   ;6. ... As. soon-as the statement has been&apos; made public,will be necessary.to consider, in the- light of the localexpression of feelings.whether a further extension of tlife of the present State Council should be arranged, orwhether an.election should be held in or before January?Colonial Office,27th August,. 19L1M.
