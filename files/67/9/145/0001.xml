At a meeting of the Home Policy Committee heldon the 30th September last,  the Committee considered aMemorandum by the Attorney-General on the powers of theHouse of Commons in the event of Mrc  Speaker&apos;s death,The legal position, as stated in the attorney general&apos;s Memorandum (Annex A attached).,  is  that on the death of Mr.  Speaker no business can b e transacted, untilthe new Speaker is chosen and elected,  and that the powers conferred by the Deputy Speaker Act of 1855 are inapplicablein the event of the Speaker&apos;s death.    The Attorney general was of opinion that if it was decided to take steps to avoidinconvenience or delay, legislation should be passed inadvance, and suggested that a Bill should be introduced toenable the Chairman of Ways and Means for the time being toact as Speaker for some specified period of short duration^2.      The Home Policy Committee generally agreed thatthe proposal to legislate was in the circumstances areasonable one, and that the next step should be toascertain the views of Members of the House of Commonsthrough the usual channels.    It was also agreed that theBill should enable the Deputy Chairman of Ways and means to Act as Speaker if,  for any reason, the Chairman of &apos;..aysand Means was unable so to act.The Commi11ee invit ed me,  as Chai man,   to b ringthe matter before the War Cabinet after the views ofMembers of the House of Commons had been ascertained,and,subject to the approval of the War Cabinet, to arrange fora Bill to be drafted and circulated for the Committee&apos;scons i deration.5.      I attach,  as Annex.B,  a note by the Chief Whipof the results of bis oonsultatioiiiWith Privy Councillorsand senior Members of Parliament,    This shows that all thepeople consulted expressed their agreement with what was proposed.4.

ANNEX    A0MEMOPJiNDUM,Pp^raRS^OF majesty&apos;s^HOJJBEJQP COMMONS IN THE EVENT&quot;*&quot;&quot; OP MR. &quot; SPEiiKER^S,&quot;SEATit.This question, which was, I understand., raised &quot;by-Sir Gilbert Campion in 1938, has been raised again in aMemorandum submitted by Mr,  T&quot;&quot;iu    I think that any members who may have considered the possibility of . Ir, Speakerf 3death nay well have assumed that the house could continueits ordinary business under the Chairman of Ways and Meansor the Deputy Speaker pending discussion as to who .ktosaldbe chosen as the new Speaker,,    The House authorities takethe view that no business could be transacted until thenew Speaker was chosen and elected,,  and I agree with themin their view of the legal position,    Until the&apos;middle ofthe nineteenth century the business of the House had to be suspended- during any temporary absence of the Speaker fromthe Chair,,    In order to avoid this inconvenience the deputy Speaker Act was passed in lS5o; but the powers:conferred under this Act on the Deputy Speaker give himpower to act only when the Speaker is  temporarily absentfrom the House,    The     words which appear in the Act arcclearly inapplicable in the event of the Speaker&apos;&amp; death,which would automatically bring to an end  the powers ofthe Deputy Speaker to act for him.,  and the Hons a beingwithout a Speaker could not function,    How muchinconvenience would be caused would depend on the urgency of the business to be transacted and the time likely tobe taken in the choice of the new Speaker,    If it isthought proper to take steps to avoid any inconvenienceor delay so occasioned,it would be necessary to legislate in advance,  as no legislation could be passed by the Houseof Commons after the Speaker1s death until a new Speakerwas chosen.    If it were decided that such legislation should be submitted to Parliament, probably the most practical form would be an Act which would enable the Cndaiataiof Ways and Means for the time being to act as Speakerfor some specified period of short duration,    If there was nourgent business the House-might not need to utilise these facilities but, particularly in Avar time,  there mightbe some measure which it was important  to pass forthwith,and the House might dislike being in any sense rushed inits choice of a new Speaker and might feel, that   the -posit tonwas one which ought to have been provided for,(Intld. ) D.BJS,Law Officers&apos; Department,August,  1941.

Ppj/ers...PJT.,,t.he .Hous e of Commons in the eventpjf Jfoa. ..S qe a ke r..flT&quot; de a th.(Reference H.P.0.(41) 55th Meeting, Conclusion 1.)The Home Policy Committee,  in considering your note on the powers of the House of Commons in the event ofMr.   Speaker fs death, agreed that the proposal to legislatewas a reasonable one;    that the views of&quot;Members of theHouse of Commons should be ascertained through the usual channels, and that you should be invited to bring the matter before the &quot;War Cabinet after the views of Members had been ascertained.I have consulted the following Privy Councillorsand senior Members on the proposal -1,      Mr.  Lees-Smith, with a request that he should consult other Labour Privy Councillors.2.      Sir Percy Harris (Liberal),3.      Mr, David Lloyd George,4.     Mr.  Ernest Brovra, with a request that he should consult Liberal National Privy Councillors,,5.     Mr. Denman (as a senior Member of the House).6.      the following Conservative Privy Councillors -Earl Winterton.Colonel Oliver Stanley.Colonel John Gretton.Sir Frederick Sykes.Colonel Walter Elliot.Sir Douglas Hacking,Colonel John Colville.Sir Hugh 0&apos;,Neill.Sir George Courthope.All the above named express their agreement withthe. proposal and agree that legislation should beintroduced to deal with the position,      The additionalsafeguard suggested, namely.that the Deputy Chairman of committees should act as Speaker if for any reason theChairman of Ways and Means was unable so to do,  is alsofavoured.One point in connection with the proposal whichhas been particularly stressed is that the Chairman of ways and Means or the Deputy Chairman should only act for a short period,    Mr. Denman&quot;has suggested that the period should be four weeks during which the House is sitting;    ColonelElliot suggests 28 days and Colonel Gretton suggests aperiod not exceeding five weeks.    I think it is important to relate any period to the sittings of the House,  in orderthat the time may not be shortened by the House being inrecess.There is.one aspect of the problem which might receive consideration.    Is it intended that this legislation should be permanent or is it to be limited to the duration of hostilities?   We oould,  of course, make the Bill atemporary one with a view to its extension later on, but I-am Inclined to think that this legislation should be madepermanent, .        .(Sgd. ) JAMES STUART.-3-. 8th December.,. 1941.
