S S C R E T.W.P.(G)(4l)  9. COPY NO..7TH FEBRUARY. 1941.WAR CABINET.MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND OFFICES UNDER THE CROW.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.The appointment of a Minister of the Crown(with a scat in the House of Gannons) as HighCommissioner in the Dominion of Canada calls for theamendment of the statutory provision whereby holders of certain offices under the Crown are disqualified from being elected to, or sitting or voting in, theHouse of Commons.The choice in this matter lies between twocourses.      The first is that legislation should belimited to posts of High commissioner in the Dominions.These posts arc broadly analogoxxs to posts ofAmbassador,      Two Members of the House of Commons have,since the war; boon a-roointed. to ambassadorial postswithout vacating their seats.      When Sir Samuel Iloarewas appointed Ambassador in Spain, the Lav/ Officersadvised that his seat would not be affected, because he was acting as a Special Envoy.      The position underthe Acts in regard to an Ambassador who is not sent ona Special Mission is, however, not so clear.The second course would be to legislate on a wider basis so as to cover the cases of Members ofthe House of Commons who are already employed inGovernment Departments in a civil capacity, and otherswhom it may be desired so to employ in future.Since the war, there have been several cases in which Departments have wished to take advantage ofthe special experience and qualifications of Membersof the House of Commons.      In some cases they havebeen given employment in an advisor;- capacity which,it is thought, docs not come within the mischief ofthe statutory disqualifications.      It is understood,however, that there are some half dozen instanceswhich arc not altogether free from doubt;    while intwo recent cases it seems difficult to believe thatthe employment of the Members in question is notcontrary to lav/.      Another unsatisfactory feature ofthe position is that one or two Members of the House ofCommons, who are also Members of one of the FightingServices, arc at present holding posts under theService Departments which are not very clearlydistinguishable from civilian posts, the holding ofwhich would come within the mischief of the Acts.At the request of the Prime Minister, theLord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of the Exchequer andI considered this matter on Friday, 7th February, and decided to recommend as follows.-1-

This question should ho handled on broad linesby reference to two  aiding principles:First, that this war calls for the host efforts of the whole nation, and that the services of those who can give valuable&apos; assistance to our war effort shouldnot he lost to the country by reason only of the factthat they are Members of the House of Commons.Secondly, that it would bo most undesirable for the House of Commons to be filled with &quot;place men&quot;,and that so far as possible the separation between the responsibilities of M.?.&apos;s and the responsibilities ofthe &quot;bcecutivc should be maintained.The first principle calls for a statutory provision in general terns to enable Members of theHouse of Commons to be appointed to posts in connectionwith our-war effort.      This provision should be limitedto the period of the war, subject to such provision asmay be necessary to avoid all appointments beingterminated automatically, in a manner which would causeadministrative inconveniciicc.     The use of some phrasesuch as &quot;posts in connection With our war effort&quot; wouldexclude appointments to certain posts which should clearly involve as a consequence the vacation of theMembers scat, even in time of war:    c.g. , appointment to a post as Metropolitan Magistrate.The second principle calls for examination and approval by some single authority of all appointmentsof Members of the House of Commons to posts inconnection with our war effort.      This might be doneby requiring that a Treasury Minute should be issued on each such occasion, and should lie on the Table ofthe House of Commons.      It is not intended that theAct should provide that an appointment, notified to theHouse by the laying of a Treasury Minute, should beannulled if an Address is TJresontcd against it withina specified period.      The object of laying a Minute isthat the House of Commons should be properly informed on this matter, and should be in a position to raise,as a general issue, the extent of the use made of thepowers conferred by the Act.The powers taken by the Act should be retrospective to the date of appointment in the caseof Members of the House of Commons appointed to Officesbefore the Act was passed into lav/, subject,  of course,to the laying of a Treasury Minute,If statutory provision is made on these lines,some corresponding action will have to be taken inregard to Parliamentary candidates.      The present ruleprohibits the holder of a civil office from publiclyannouncing himself,  or allowing himself to be publicly announced, as a prospective candidate for election toParliament for any constituency until ho has resignedfrom his employment.      This rule, however, is laid downby Order in Council, and can be modified without legislation.(Intld.)      J.A.Great George Street,  S. \7.1. ,7TH FEBRUARY,  19410
