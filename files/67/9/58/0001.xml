:.. !&apos; .     Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, the Heads of anAgreement reached between the Soviet, Ambassador and the parliamentary under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs about the repatriation of the Baltic seamen.Three separate attempts were made to secure from the Soviet government an assurance that visas required for crossing the territory of the Soviet union would be granted to the British subjects who volunteered to fight for Finlandagainst the Soviet Union and who are now stranded in Finland and Sweden.In this matter it did not, however, prove possible to obtain satisfaction fromthe Soviet Government, and in this respect the bargain suggested by the Cabinet(War Cabinet Conclusions 35 (41) of the 3rd April) has hot proved possible toobtain.In view of the fact that these negotiations have now continued for nearlysix months, and in view of the need for clearing up this question and removingat least one small problem from the path of Anglo-Soviet relations, I have thoughtit better to clinch matters and have so informed the Soviet Ambassador. Mycolleagues will see that the Agreement is made without prejudice to the majorBaltic questions.The Minister of War Transport has made this Agreement possible by hisgenerous attitude in making available and reconditioning one of the Baltic ships.Since reaching agreement with M. Maisky, I have received a telegram fromHis Majesty&apos;s Minister at Helsingfors reporting,- on the authority of the FinnishLegation in Berlin, that there is a possibility that the German Government will permit the repatriation of the British volunteers referred to above. If this is confirmed, it should be possible to get them back to this country by sea withoutpassing through the Soviet Union.A.
