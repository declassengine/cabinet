(41) 97th Conclusions, Minute 2)1* PARAGRAPH IN &quot;DAILY HERALD1&apos; OP THURSDAY,  SEPTEMBER 85TH,HEADED &quot;IDLE FACTORY &quot;SCANDAL^(l) It appears that the factory in question is the ThamesAmmunition Works at Erith owned by Vickers Armstrong Limited.It is engaged on ammunition filling and employs about 450 menand 600 women.(2) I am informed by the Ministry of Labour that the&quot;Government Inspector&quot; mentioned in the paragraph is a semi-skilled worker engaged on inspection work at a humble level.(3) I have received the following report from the parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Supply&quot;During the period 2nd to 17th September, there was somehold-up at the Factory owing to lack of provedfuzes.    Misty weather conditions caused the delay inproving fuzes which can only be proved when the atmosphere is clear.The factory was at no time stopped and the incident wouldappear to have been exaggerated.The fuzes are filled by Vickers at their Dartford Works.The following are the acceptances of proof from thebeginning of this month:When the difficulty arose, it was immediately apparent tothe Management who promptly took all possible steps to employ the labour in other parts of the factory.Where filling is dependent on proof of time- fuzes, as inthis case, there is always a danger of a hold-up underdifficult weather conditions but endeavours are made tocarry sufficient stocks of filled fuzes so as to reducesuch troubles to a minimum.&quot;2*9.41.17.9.41.39.9,41.20.9.41.10,00024,0006C 0006,000.-1-

(4)       i understand that the difficulties&apos;have now been overcome,and that work is proceeding normally,    I do not recommend thatany specific reply should be made to this allegation or that anyspecial action should be taken as a result of my investigation of it.II. ARTICLE HEADED &quot;VALLEY OF CHAOS&quot; IN THE &quot;DAILY MAIL&quot; OPTHURSDAY,  september*?IbER &apos; 8 5TH.(1)   The allegations,This article deals with the Stroud Valley inGloucestershire.    It alleges that new factories have &quot;swarmedinto the   Valley&quot; since the beginning of the war in spite of thefact that public services were inadequate;  that the one smallGas Works has broken downj that the water supply and sewage disposal works are inadequate for the present population; thatinadequate billets are available for labour transferred intothe area because it &quot;swarms with evacuees&quot;! that an urgently needed &quot;British Restaurant&quot; has not been provided because ofobstruction by the local authority.( 2 )   The cause of the trouble.It is quite true that factories have &quot;swarmed into&quot;the area.    This Is dealt with in paragraph 9 below.(3)   Gas supplies.The local plant is inadequate for the burden and ison the point of breaking down,    A link with Gloucester andCheltenham has,   therefore, been constructed and will becompleted in a few days&apos;  time     The capacity of the Gloucesterand Cheltenham Gas Works will not at once  suffice to meet allthe needs of the district, but new plant there is expected tocome into operation in six or eight weeks* time and there will then be a clear margin of gas capacitor.    The local plant willbe closed down for reconditioning.    It will be started up again as soon as it is ready,(4)   Water supplies.The present demand is just about equal to the maximumyield of the present supplies, but the position is onlymaintained by cutting off water for domestic use at night overa large part of the area,    A new plant is now under constructionto supplement existing supplies and is expected to come intooperation in a few months&apos; time.(5)    Sewage dispqsal,-The sewage disposal works are inadequate for the presentincreased population, but the task of installing new disposalworks, is too great to contemplate under war conditions.    The result is that much crude sewage is discharged into the River Frome9 butthere is no evidence that this has any serious consequences or that the health of the district is thereby endangered.(6)   Housing accpmmodati on.mThe population of the Stroud Urban District has increased from 14,100 in 1938 to 17,600 in June 1941 and there is seriouscongestion.    The demand for accommodation for wax- workers lias notyet reached its maximum,

Detailed points are:-(a) The district still contains official evacuees.    Ofthe 800 who remained last July, some 300 were membersof families of whom at least one person was engaged on local war work and whose families are not,therefore, being removed.    The remainder are beingremoved as additional war workers come  into thedistrict,,(b) An order has been made prohibiting further unofficialmovement into the district.    The Minister ofHealth is ascertaining the number of unofficialevacuees in the area and will then consider whether any of them should be compulsorily removed.(c) It has been necessary to reject the suggestionthat workers In the district should travel dailyfrom Gloucester because the available billetsthere are all wanted for local workers.(d) The provision of hostels would be no solution as these would increase the burden on the public utilities,,(e) In order to reduce to a minimum the need for importing labour the Ministry of Labour and Boardof Trade have for some tine   arranged for the   -greatest possible release of labour by the localindustries.,(7)   Air Ministry Accounts Office.In order to relieve the housing pressure the ministers of Health and Labour have for some time been urging theremoval of the Air Ministry Accounts Office which employs some500 persons billeted in the district in addition to some 300locally recruited,    This office was moved into the district inthe early days of the war in accordance with the officialscheme for the evacuation of Government office staffs from london and the Air Ministry can in no way be blamed for the move*The Secretary of State for Air has been reluctant to move theoffice elsewhere now, because of the difficulty of findingalternative accommodation and because a move would mean the lossof at any rate some of the locally recruited workers and wouldinvolve some delays and dislocation in the work of the office.This includes the arrangements for the pay of members of theR.A.F. and their dependents0The Minister of Works and Buildings has informed me thataccommodation for this office could be found at Malvern:    theMinister of Health reports that billets for the staff would beavailable  there,(8)   Estab lishment of Br.it.isli Restaurants.,There is now one British Restaurant in Stroud run by theLocal Authority.    This is   supplying one thousand meals a day frombreakfast to supper inclusive.    The demand is so great thatadmission is by ticket,/   The Minister has not hitherto had powers for this purpose, but will shortly obtain them under a Defence Regulation now being prepared,primarily in order to give fuller control over the population in areas near &quot;blitzed&quot; toWhs0    Consideration has not yet been given tothe question of principle involved in the proposal now in quest ion.

Proposals for further facilities have been discussed withthe Local Aut ority, but have made little progress; the Clerk hasbeen particularly obstructive,.    As one argument against BritishRestaurants he advances office staff difficulties, but he has beeninformed that special staff can be engaged if necessary forBritish Restaurant accounts, their wages being a proper charge inthe accounts.If buildings prove a difficulty, the Ministry of Pood will,if necessary, provide Nissen hutsc    If satisfactory proposals arenot made within a reasonable time, the Minister has compulsory powers but he will not  vi..di to use them except in the last resort.(9)   How and why has the congestion occurred?   Has there beenproper control over the^establishment of new Factories?(a) The Ministries of Health and Labour have been drawingthe attention of Production Departments to the difficulties ofthis area since December 1940 o(b) Until a few months ago there was no effective controlover the movement of private firms,(c) In the case of undertakings for which Production departments are directly or indirectly responsible, the decision has rested withthe Department concerned.    These Departments have made their own arrangements for seeing that considerations of labour supply,housing, public utilities, etc-   are not overlooked before a decision is taken with regard to the erection of a new factory and for consultation with the Departments concerned with the various services.    It is, however, certain that in the past under pressure of circumstances due regard has not always been paid to all the relevant considerations.(10)   Proposed remedies for the situation in the Stroud Valley.(a)    Public services.Steps are already in hand to provide the necessary gasand water supplies. Nothing can be done as to sewage, nor isit essential.(b )   Billet ing accommodation^I recommend that the Secretary of State for Air shouldbe asked to arrange for the removal of the Air Ministry AccountsOffice to Malvern and that the Minister of Health should be askedto take all possible steps to accelerate the removal of theremaining official evacuees (iDe. families with no members engaged on war work).    The Minister also proposes to consider what steps should be taken In regard to unofficial evacuees.(c)   British Restaurants.,I propose to ask the Minister of Food to make quite clear to the Local Authority that he will be ready to use hiscompulsory pov/ers if proposals for speedy action are notforthcomings(11&quot;)   Proposals for avoiding similar troubles arising elsewhere..(a)       To supplement the action taken by Production Departmentsthemselves, the Minister of Works and Buildings has recently taken steps to obtain information as to all new factory proposalsshowing what labour force will be required to operate thefactory and what the demand of the factory will be on the various-4-

publxc services, and to collate this with information as to theavailable resources in the way of labour, housing, gas,electricity?  etc.(b) The Production Executive recently decided that, when this information had been obtained, all proposals for the establishmentof new factories should be submitted to one central authorityfor approval.      If this can be arranged, there will in future be this further safeguard.(c) Difficulties may arise in connection with factories nowunder construction which were begun before present arrangements had been established.      Probably any such cases will have been already picked up with a view to any possible remedial action being taken, but I propose to ask the Ministers for theProduction Departments to make a further examination of any possible cases of difficulty from this point of view,III.   &quot;MUDDLES IN WAR PRODUCTION&quot;.    REPORT IN THE  &quot;TIMES&quot;OPTHURSDAY.  25TH SEPTEMBER8 OF A SPEECH BY MR. GOl^ON^ENGLAND,CHAIRMAN OF THE ENGINEERING INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION.1.     Mr. Gordon England is Managing Director of an aircraftfirm which is not a member of the manufacturers ring and theEngineering Industries Association is a relatively new and notvery representative body.     The Minister of Aircraft production has met Mr, Gordon England on a number of occasions andMr, Harold Macmillan attended a meeting to which Mr. GordonEngland had invited Members of Parliament, he has also circulated a pamphlet &quot;A plan for war production&quot;;    but it has -been impossible to find out that he has any very precise constructive proposals to put forward.2,      Some of his proposals appear to be sound in principle- andto represent the general lines on which Departments are trying towork, e.g. they are trying to associate industry more closely with the control and planning of production through theestablishment of &quot;Panels&quot; or &quot;Groups&quot; to deal with specificproducts,     They would all agree that contracts should be placed,so far as possible, at &quot;fixed prices&quot;, and that continuous orders should be placed whenever practicable, but Mr, Gordon Englandoffers no advice as to how greater success is to be achieved inthe adoption of these principles.      In general, he laments the factthat the financial incentives which in peace-time promote theefficiency of industry are not now operative as regards eithermanagements or workers.     He entirely fails to recognise thatthis is due to the facts of war-time and seems to attribute itto Treasury control or the Government&apos;s financial policy andhas,  therefore, no remedy to suggest other than the pouring outof more and more money.3*     I do not recommend that any specific reply should be madeto this publicity.J.A.Great George Street, S.W.1.,29TH SEPTEMBER,  19L1 .
