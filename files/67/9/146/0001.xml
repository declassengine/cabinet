Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1941.SECRET. Copy No. gj^W.P. (G) (41) 146.December 3, 1941.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED CALL-UP OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.THE Lord Presidents Committee is recommending to the War Cabinet theearly drafting into the army of the 7,000 skilled agricultural workers whosecall-up has previously been deferred.I ask the War Cabinet to reject this recommendation.These men are as much a part of the defence of the country as the workersih the tank and aircraft factories or the soldiers with their units. And they areperforming tasks of value and for which they are better equipped than for anyduties they would be called upon to undertake in the Army.We are faced, owing to the growing demands for tonnage for their own usenow being made by the Americans, with curtailment in our imports from north america of food as well as war stores. It is therefore vital that the increasedagricultural programme for 1942 should be carried through.I would rather consent to the withdrawal of men from Ministry of Supplyfactories than agree to this depletion of the agricultural labour force.It is my belief that a number of young men could be found by means of acomb-out of the able-bodied individuals employed in Government Departments.And an additional source of supply should be the very large number of menalready in uniform but performing clerical tasks which could easily be undertaken by older civilians.B.December 3, 1941.9&quot;   -[23229]
