WOMEN LABOUR FOR FILLING FACTORIEIn accordance with the War Cabinet decision attheir Meeting on 13th November, 1941 (W.M.(41) 113thConclusions) we have met and agreed the following statement of the facts as to the supply of women workers to the filling factories.An agreed table of figures is annexed.    Thisshows that of the estimated ultimate strength of 162,000,the number employed at 1st November,  1941, was 87,000.During the last 6 months this number has been increasedby 39,000 from 48,000*    The weekly demand is 3,700 butthe average intake over the last 8 weeks has been 1,750.This intake has been approximately stable over the last6 weeks, but for certain important factories,  such asChorley, Kirkby, Risley and Swynnerton,  it has shown afalling off.In the 8 weeks* under review 14,000 women in all were recruited whilst the net increase was 9,&apos;:     women.There was thus a wastage of 5,000 women workers in 8 weeks,i.e. about 625 per week.    As a percentage of averagestrength over the period this represents a v/a stage rate of1.75% per week.    This wastage rate is about the same asthat for a large sample of Ministry of Supply contractorsin the Engineering and Allied Trades,Statistical records of absenteeism show that anaverage of nearly 25% per shift of the women workers onthe factory books are absent from work,    Causes of theseabsences are of many kinds,  some of which would not normally be classed under the term &quot;absenteeism&quot;.Sickness,  injury and leave with permission are cases in point and account for nearly one-third of the total.-(Signed)    GoH.
