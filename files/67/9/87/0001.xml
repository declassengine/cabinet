SECRET.W.P. (G)(41) 87. COPY NO.BOTH AUGUST,  1941.WAR CABINET.FIRE PREVENTION EXECUTIVE.Memorandum by the Lord President of the_Council.1. At their meeting on the 30th December,  1940,(W.M.   311th Conclusions, Minute 3),   the War Cabinet approved in principle  the establishment of a special organisation,  tobe called^ the Fire Prevention Executive,  to secure promptaotion frj  the various Government Departments concerned in applying effective measures of fire prevention in targetareas throughout the country.       The Postmaster Generalagreed to act as Chairman Of the Executive and representatives were appointed by the Departments concerned.2. The Executive has done much work of great value in formulating standards, giving guidance and co-ordinatingactivities both on administrative and technical matters.When the initial action on these lines had been taken,  theExecutive came to  the conclusion that if effective progress was  to be maintained it was of the first importance thatfire prevention work should be regionalised and that further powers of supervision and co-ordination should be delegated to Regional Commissioners.      This recommendation wasconsidered and accepted by the Ministers concerned, and effect has been given to  it.3. In these circumstances the Postmaster General was-ofopinion that as  the main task of co-ordination at the centrehas been accomplished,  there was no real advantage in maintaining the Executive  in its existing form.      This view is reinforced by the consideration that,  as a result of discussions which the Home Secretary and Minister of home security has been having with the Employers&apos;  organisations and the Trades Union Congress about the amendment of the fire Prevention Orders,  it is felt desirable  that he and theSecretary of State for Scotland,  as  the&quot;Ministers responsible in England and Wales and in Scotland respectively,  should be advised by a National Advisory Council for Fire Preventionset up under the Chairmanship of the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security and that this Council should include representatives of the Employers&apos;  Organisations andof the Trades Union Congress.       This representation would,it is thought,  facilitate the smooth working of the fire prevention Orders.

4. The dissolution of the existing Fire PreventionExecutive and the substitution of a National AdvisoryCouncil under the Home Secretary and Minister of home security carries with it the recognition of him as theMinister responsible for co-ordinating at the centre all matters of fire prevention policy.      Having regard to hisspecial relationship with Regional Commissioners, who now have delegated authority in Fire Prevention matters,   and tothe fact that he is  the Minister who is responsible toParliament for the National Fire Service and for the fire prevention Orders in England and Wales,  I suggest that hisposition should be so recognised.      It is proposed that theSecretary of State for Scotland,   as the Minister responsiblefor fire prevention arrangements generally in Scotland,should be represented on the National Advisory Council.5. I should like to pay a high tribute to the very valuable work performed by the Postmaster General,  as chairman of  the Executive and by Sir John Greenly, who has undertaken administrative charge of the organisation, andhis colleagues.o. I recommend that the Fire Prevention Executiveshould be dissolved as soon as the newAdvisory Council canbe set up.7 The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityagrees with the recommendations in this paper.(Intld.)
