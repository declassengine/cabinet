The Governing Body of the International Labour Office has decided to holda Conference at the end of October which, on the invitation of the United StatesGovernment, is to be held in New York*    The initiative for holding a Conferenceoame from the United States s Dominion and Allied Governments *2*    This matter has been discussed with the British Employers&apos; Confederationand the Trades Union Congress General Council and advantage has been taken ofthe presence hero of Mr, Carter Goodrich, Chairman of the Governing Body, toexamine the problems connected with this projects    Tho Confederation and theTrades Union Congress represented that(a) while they favoured a Conference they regarded it as essential thatit should be sufficiently representative of Governments, employers and workers to make tho Conf erence   a success.    They wore particularly anxious that the British Commonwealth and the Allied governments should all bo represented by tripartite delegations!(b) the delegations to the Conference should be sufficiently numerousand strong to make it impossible for any of the Axis controlledcountries either by speech or by vote, to take any effective actionto jeopardise its succcsss(o) having regard to the faot that delegates of standing could not beabsent from this country for more than a short period, it wasnecessary that special stops should bo taken to facilitate the journey to and from New York,     It was also asked that adequatefinancial arrangements should bo made.3*     It has been ascertained that full delegations will attend from BritishCommonwealth countries, and at a mooting of the Allied Countries at thePoreign Office, they all agreed to send full delegations so far as representatives were available cither in this country or in the United States.The United States has taken stops to encourage the sending of delegations fromthe South American countries and it is understood that thoso will be wellrepresentcd*As regards travel it is understood that, if so authorised, tho Ministryof Air could arrange for tho delegates from this country to be conveyed by thoNorth Atlantic route, subject to weathor conditions,k*    The suggestion also emerged that it would be most helpful if thePresident could see his way clear to open the Conference and to make a worldbroadcast.     This suggestion will be conveyed to him by Mr* Carter Goodrich ata later date.     In our viow this is of first importance and may well be thespark which will set alight the foroes in Europe which are opposed to thoHitler Now Order,    Tho statement which he oould make in suoh a setting wouldhavo a very groat effect on the masses in Europe and in other parts of theworld.    It would give him an opportunity of presenting the alternative tothe Hitler Order,    With suoh an opening the Oohf orcnoe, if well organised and directed, can become a groat world democratic platform at a oritical timein the war.

YiThile it is necessary to avoid giving the Conference an appearance ofbeing mainly a propaganda move, it may he possible to arrange at a propertime thai; the representatives ;of Biutish, Allied and other Governments inthe United States may be present.6*    V.re should be glac!* therefore, if our colleagues would authorise theMinisters of Air and Yfar Transport to collaborate triLth us in securing themost rapid means of travel for the Delegates and give authority for other necessary facilities in order that prominent employers1 and workers1representatives may be encouraged to attend the Conference.A. 33*33.
