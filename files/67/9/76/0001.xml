Printed for the War Cabinet.  August 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 76.August 1, 1941.WAR CABINET.THE BLACK OUT : MINISTRY OF SUPPLY vehicles and FACTORIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.I ASK that vehicles engaged on work for the Ministry of Supply should be permitted to carry headlights from the 15th September throughout the winter.Forty per cent, of the traffic of this Ministry is carried on lorries.Swift dispatch is essential to our programme.In addition, our manufacturers&apos; lorries are responsible for the transport ofprobably 80 per cent, of the goods leaving their plants.Further, we carry most of our passenger traffic by bus. This movement of passengers is essential to the efficient and orderly conduct of our factories.I ask also that authority be given to the Ministry of Supply to continue to operate factories after the black out has been destroyed by blast.It is essential that continuity of production should be maintained where no damage has been inflicted on the manufacturing capacity of a plant. And thedecision to interrupt or to continue production should rest with the production department, unfettered by any rigid restrictions.B.Ministry of Supply, August 1, 1941.[22815]
