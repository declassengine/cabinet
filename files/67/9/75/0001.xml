At their meeting on nth June, 1940 (W.M. (40) 161st Conclusions,Item 6) the War Cabinet were informed that the Canadian Government had undertaken to receive 4,000 internees and 3,000 German prisoners of war in viewof the military situation at that time. In January, 1941, the Prime Ministerapproved the transfer to Canada of an additional 1,000 prisoners.2. At present there are in the United Kingdom some 2,000 German prisonersof war and merchant seamen fit to travel They are all of a dangerous type,and their security would be a matter for grave anxiety in the event of invasion.In such an event we shall have to use the vacant spaces in existing camps fornewly-captured prisoners, and the combination of the character, knowledge and status of the existing prisoners with the fighting value of the newcomersmay give considerable trouble. Apart from the merchant seamen, the prisonersare Luftwaffe or U-Boat men, and would be a valuable asset to the enemy ifreleased by an invading force.3. I had previously been reluctant to contemplate the transfer of furtherprisoners to Canada partly because of the shipping difficulties and partly because the troubles at Fort Henry which led to reprisals against some of ourown officers in Germany, had not yet been settled. The difficulties at FortHenry have, however, largely disappeared and I have no reason to think thatdie despatch of more German prisoners to Canada would have any prejudicialeffect on the treatment of our own prisoners in Germany.4. I realise that shipping facilities will not at present allow the despatchof these prisoners, but in view of the military considerations referred to inparagraph 2 above, I ask the War Cabinet to authorize me to take up withthe Canadian authorities, in consultation with the Dominions Office and theMinistry of War Transport, the question of transferring an additional 2,000German prisoners of war to Canada, in order that the opportunity may betaken without further formality when it presents itself.D.
