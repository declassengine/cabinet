First Lord of . trie Admiralty.In consultation with my colleagues of the Board of Admiralty,I have been considering the possibility of obtaining ^commissioned officers forH.M, Navy from a wider field that has-been customary hitherto.2. ,We are agreed that,both fort the good of the Navy and on social; and national grounds the field should be as wide as. possible.3,.    -       &apos; We consider that by. a proper use of the national systemof education, we should .be able tp find officers with the necessary standardof good general education to enable them to take full advantage of.the specialised courses which form so large.a part,of. the naval officers;professional life, and that we should be able tp find such material, in allclasses of the community.    ,It is: nott to be expected that,this result could-be so often or so satisfactorily adbieved&apos; by early promotion from the: lowerdeck and we must also have in -mind the. greater efficiency obtained ifprospective officers are trained in, he responsibility and. leadershipinherent in their commissioned status, from the earliest days, of their vofficial^ connection, with.the naval service.&apos;... :. .Provision will however continue t.o &quot;be made forcommissions from warrant rank, and from.-the lower deck.. 4* We have come to the conclusion, therefore, that our bestcpurseis to institute a system of scholarships at Dartmouth on the-following lines:- - &apos; .(a) Scholarships, subject tb: a /means test, to be offered&quot;&apos;-      : - to:::up. to-10, candidates from grant-aided secondary schools(out of an average total entry of 45 a term),who reach asuitable standard in the written examination.    ,this examination- will be modified by the introduction of* alternative papers or questions as necessary,(b) Similar scholarships to be offered to the candidatesfrom other schools who reach the minimum educational levelof the Secondary School candidates, up to a maximum of 10.
(c) Scholarship candidates to be recommended foriacceptance or rejection^ but not graded,by the Interview Board. -(d) Financial assistance to scholars to be, gradedaccording to means, the very poorest beingrelieved of all expenses at Dartmouth andin the. training-cruiser. &apos;:(e). An additional scholarship to be. given to the son of a rating or ex-*ratlng, other than&quot;Hostilities Only&quot;, who   takes the highest, place in the examination below the Scholars.(f) The value of King^ Cadetships to be brought   ;up to the full scholarship level.5, The maximum cost, if all possible scholarships were awarded.every term and all the recipients required full relief, would be  51,500a year eventually, but we do not expect the number of scholarships actuallygiven to increase the cost of Dartmouth to the -Crown by more than  26,000a year when the scheme has fully matured, in 4 years from the award of thefirst scholarships.6* i should like to introduce the scheme for the Dartmouthexamination to be held in May and an early decision is therefore desirable&apos;in order that the parents of possible candidates may have adequateforeknowledge. -:   7. The finance of the proposal will be discussed in detail with the Treasury, but as the proposal involves issues of social andpolitical importance I should be glad to know that the War Cabinet areagreeable to the principle before further Departmental action is taken.A.
