Agency Factories remain Government property,but the management is entrusted to an agent remunerated by- a&apos;&apos;- fee1.. !;;:.l2, Five filling factories are now approaching completion.3,-        In view of the strain imposed on the Royal OrdnanceFactory organisation by its tremendous expansion since thewar it was decided that these five factories should beentrusted to Agents to manage, and be described as Ministryof Supply Factories,,      The Ministry of Supply accordinglysought the assistance of reputable companies to manage these factories.      Lyons have agreed to manage Elstowj    LeversQueniborough;    Imperial Tobacco Burghfield;    CourtauldsFeatherstone;    and Metal Closures Ltd., Walsall.      This give:;the advantage, in each case,  of having an organisationaccustomed to dealing with large numbers of employees.-     TheDepartment gains not merely the services of indiyiduals asmanagers, but the experience and co-operation of a completeworking organisation with a repxitation to maintain,-4* It is in each case an additional convenience that the agent has a factory of his own in the neighbourhood of thenew filling factory.58 The firms have agreed that the industrial gradesemployed in these factories shall receive Royal OrdnanceFactory wages and conditions0      Those wages and conditions have been settled in the regular way by negotiation with theTrade Unions concerned,6, The financial terms suggested are that the agentreceives -(a) A fee for management service so(b) Repayment of actual costs incurred,.      These costs donot include any overhead expenses,  so that the firms cannot recover indirectly through overheadsany salary paid to their officers in excess of the direct charge admitted by the Ministry of Supply,&apos; If they pay their officers any excess, they must do so, therefore, out of their own revenue, and cannot charge it against the Ministry*

7. In these circumstances, their position is the same asthat of many industrial concerns who have lent officers to direct Government service,,      The Government either pays these officers the rate appropriate to their work in government service, or nothing at all,-,      The firms pay-the balance out oftheir own revenues^8a .      The firms are by no means eager to accept responsibilityfor these factories and made it quite clear that they would only do so if conditions allowed of their appointing to the responsible posts persons in whom they felt full confidence.There is no evidence that the salaries proposed represent anysubstantial increase over salaries the persons, concerned arealready receiving in their3 present posts09* It is possible that the firms might agree to abandon the fees even though this would, involve them in a loss on the contracts     Metal Closures is a much smaller concern than the others, and mi glib find it more difficulto10. All these arrangements are governed, only by the desireto get the best management and the most efficient production.11.       The Ministry of Supply has in many oases entrustedGovernment factories to the management of selected agents0In a number of cases the Ministry has reversed the processand altered the management of private firmsp      In two cases,the Ministry has taken the extreme measure of acquiring thewhole shareholding and installing their own managementuIn a number of other cases it has appointed, an authorisedController.      In still more cases the existence of the powershas enabled the Ministry,, without their formal exercise, toalterthe management of firms considered inefficient^12.        It is necessary to settle the question very soon.The firms are already in discussion with the Ministry as to tfiepractical details,,      Their key personnel are in training atRoyal Ordnance Factories, and in one case they have taken overparts of - a building that should be in production by the New13*        If it is necessary to make other arrangements - whichwill at best involve some months loss of production - theMinistry must start to do so at once.-(Intldo)    H .M oParliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Supply0Great George Street, S,w,-i.-,;20TH DECEMBER,  1941.
