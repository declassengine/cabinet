Printed for the War Cabinet.  September 1941.SECRET.W.P. (G) (41) 92.September 4, 1941.WAR CABINET.FRENCH NORTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a memorandum prepared in myDepartment on recent changes in the French military command in French north africa.A. E.Foreign Office, September 4, 1941.Memorandum.Changes in the Military Command in French North Africa.THE following changes have been announced :  General de Lattre de Tassigny to be Commander-in-Chief in Tunis.General Koeltz to be Commander-in-Chief at Algiers.General Juin to be Commander-in-Chief in Morocco.2. General Weygand retains his post as Delegate-General in French africa and Governor-General of Algeria, and General Nogues remains in Morocco asResident-General.   Their positions seem to remain unchanged.3. It was also suggested from Vichy that General Huntziger had beenappointed to command the French troops in North Africa, but this has been sincedenied.4. Of the above appointments, the most interesting is that of general de Lattre. He and General Koeltz formerly served on General Weygand&apos;s staff at the Ministry of War. General de Lattre used to be on very friendly terms with members of the British Embassy in Paris, and with General Heywood inparticular. He fought brilliantly in the Battle of France. He was sent up withthe 14th Division to establish liaison between General Corap&apos;s 9th Army andGeneral Huntziger&apos;s 2nd Army. He found, on his arrival, that the former had broken in disorder and the latter had given way. He subsequently held thebridge at Rethel, on the Aisne, and enabled the remnants of the 9th Army to getover. One Frenchman at least has written that, if all the French generals hadbeen like de Lattre, France would still be fighting. M. de Margerie said, afterthe collapse, that he was one of the French generals with whom we should maketouch when the time came for further joint action. General Koeltz has recentlybeen &quot; Directeur des Services d&apos;Armistice,&quot; and is therefore unlikely to have any sympathy with the Germans. He is, however, said to be a nonentity. free french headquarters speak well of General Juin, who is an ex-prisoner of war.General de Gaulle, whose &quot; Camarade de Promotion &quot; he was, considers that he is unlikely to take risks.11480   [22889]Copy No.   58
5. It is in our interest that the army rather than the navy should besupreme in North Africa. The only admiral who still holds a territorialcommand there is Admiral Esteva, who is still Governor of Tunisia, but who isintensely anti-German.6. Darlan, despite his seven stars and his new role of Minister of Defence,probably feels that he must placate the army. There is, moreover, little that a french general can do in France at, the present moment. The Germans have onlyallowed a small French army with the minimum equipment. We have heard ofhidden stores of arms, but they can hardly be appreciable. In North Africa, onthe other hand, the French may have been more effective in concealing arms andequipment from the Armistice Commission. We have heard that there is a numberof tanks hidden away in the Atlas Mountains.7. For the above reasons, the new appointments seem to hold favourablepossibilities, and it would be desirable to seize an)^ opportunities that may presentthemselves for contact with the new generals, particularly General de Lattre.Foreign Office, September 3, 1941.
