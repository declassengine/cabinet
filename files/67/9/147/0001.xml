Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1941.SECRET. Copy No.    61W.P (G) (41) 147.December 5, 1941.YiTAR CABINET.CALL-UP OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.IN the course of a man-power review at the end of 1940, the agricultural ministers agreed that some 22,000 men might be taken from agriculture into theServices during 1941.About 12,000 of these were men engaged in ancillary work as gardeners,pigmen, poultrymen, &amp;c. About these no question is raised, and most of them have already been called up for military service.The remaining 10,000 are men in the main agricultural occupations.2. In framing his man-power plans for the twelve months ending June1942, the Minister of Labour accordingly relied on being able to obtain these10,000 men for the Services; and arrangements were made for the County war agricultural Committees to select the men from the farms from which they could most easily be spared.In the summer of 1941, however, the Agricultural Ministers represented thatit would not, after all, be possible to spare all these men from agriculture. Itwas admitted that they included some who had been &quot; sheltering &quot; in agricul-ture, and that these, together with some of the youngest men, perhaps 3,000 inall, might properly be combed out. It was claimed, however, that the remaining7,000 could not be called up without prejudice to the programme of foodproduction.3. These representations were considered by the Lord presidents committee in August. It was decided that, in view of the lateness of the harvest,the calling up of these men should be deferred until the 1st December, 1941. Thequestion whether there could be any further deferment after that date was leftto be decided in the light of the general review of the man-power position, whichwas then being undertaken (L.P. (41) 44th Meeting, Minute 1).4. In their general review of the man-power position for the year endingJune 1942, the Ministry of Labour originally contemplated that the demands ofthe Services and Civil Defence would total, 829,000 men. The supply already available from all sources was 468,000, including those earmarked for withdrawal from industry; and measures were proposed for finding the balance of 361 ,000 men.Included among the 468,000 to be withdrawn from industry were the 10,000who were to be provided from agriculture. Among the measures proposed for raising the balance of 361,000, it was contemplated that an additional 156,000men would have to be withdrawn from essential industries. These would have included another 10,000 men from agriculture.As a result of amendments which the War Cabinet has made in the originalplan, the additional numbers to be found have been reduced to 215,000; and itwill no longer be necessary to draw more than a small number, possibly about10,000, from the essential industries. It is not proposed to draw any of thesefrom agriculture.   The plan still contemplates, however, the withdrawal from[23234]
industry (including agriculture) of the men already earmarked for the Services,who were included in the total of 468,000 taken as the available supply underthe original plan.In suggesting that the Ministry of Labour should not, after all, call up theagricultural workers included in this 468,000, the Agricultural Ministers aredemanding for agriculture a concession which it has not been thought practicable to grant to the munitions industries or any of the other essential industries and services. If the calling up of these men were further deferred, a correspondingnumber would have to be taken from some other essential industry or service,e.g., transport, gas or electricity.5. The Agricultural Ministers do not contest the foregoing statement of theposition. They represent, however, that agriculture has already lost, not only83,000 men to the Forces, but also 40,000 to other industries; and that, if these7,000 are withdrawn from agriculture, it will not be possible to fulfil the additional programme of food production for 1942. Indeed, they think it doubtful whether itwill prove possible even to maintain the level of food production reached in 1941.Between 1939 and 1941 an additional 3f million acres have been brought under cultivation an increase of 33 per cent, in tillage. The programme for1942 provides for another 1^ million acres bringing the total increase up to nearly 50 per cent. The cropping programme for 1942 includes large increases in potatoes, sugar-beet and vegetables, all of which make heavy demands on labour.The Agricultural Ministers therefore take the view that, if the decision towithdraw these 7,000 men from agriculture is confirmed, it will be necessary tomodify the 1942 programme, and to inform the County War agricultural committees accordingly. The announcement that the 7,000 men are to be with-drawn will provoke criticism from agricultural interests.6. The War Cabinet have already recognised that the man-power situationcalls for sacrifices on all sides. My Committee consider that agriculture shouldmake its contribution, as other essential industries have been required to do.They find it difficult to accept the contention that the withdrawal of 7,000 menfrom an industry in which about 830,000 males over 16 are now engaged mustnecessarily result in so great a loss of food production as has been suggested. Itseems to them that agriculture should be able to make good some part, at anjr rate,of the deficiency by increased employment of women, further use of part-timelabour, and other methods of improvisation to which industry has been compelled to resort under pressure of war conditions.However that may be, my Committee are satisfied that the retention of these7,000 men in agriculture would disturb the balance of the man-power plan; andthey do not feel justified in recommending any further deferment of the calling upof these men for military service.J. A.Great George Street, S.W. 1,December 5, 1941.
