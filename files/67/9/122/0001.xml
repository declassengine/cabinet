SECRET&apos;w.p .(G)(41) 12228th October 1941 WAR CABINETBITRM6; CONSTITUTIONAL FUTURE -Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Burma.In the course of statements which he was authorised tomake in July and:Jiugust 1940 the- Governor, Sir A. Cochrane,announced thatilis Majesty&apos;s Government would continue to use their best endeavours to promote Burma&apos;s-attainment ofDominion status and that after the war they would be willingto discuss the problems to be solved in Burma.   This state-merit has been much criticised in Burma as lacking in .precision.   During this summer u Saw has repeatedly pressed the Governor, Sir R. Dorman-Smith, for some clarification ofthe objects of the promised post-war discussion, and It waspart of the purpose pf his visit to this country to seeksome such clarification. -The sort of formula which u saw has proposed to Sir R.Dorman-Smith is that &quot;the object of- the- discussions with HisMajesty&apos;s Government immediately on the conclusion of thewar will be the immediate establishment of full self-government in Burma subject to such temporary arrangements as may be necessary in respect of Defence and Foreign -Affairs&quot;or &quot;subject to such temporary reservations as may be agreedupon&quot; or &quot;as may be found necessary&quot;.   A formula of. this &apos; .kind could not be accepted because it would virtuallyanticipate and prejudge the conclusions of the post-war -discussions on particular subjects - not only on Defence andForeign Affairs but also on such important subjects as thefuture of the large areas in Burma., inhabited by non-Burmesepeoples (such as the Shans and the hill tribes on the frontiers, some of whom like the Nagas, are very backward)and, moreover, on the whole range of the Governor&apos;s existingspecial responsibilities for such purposes as peace andtranquillity, financial stability and interests of minoritiesand of the Services.   The impossibility of examining these problems now and of giving a promise which would virtuallyprejudge the examination and decisions to be reached on themafter the war has been pointed out to U Saw.At the same time we could, and should, I think, take theopportunity of his visit to this country to impress on him the sincerity of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwith regard to the scope of these post-war discussions.U Saw&apos;s motive in desiring a clarification is, very naturallyto ease the difficulties in which he finds himself in theLegislature and the country vis-a-vis his own and other political parties, and enable him to secure their continued co-operation in the war effort.    It is possible that itwould help him in these difficulties if he could go back to burma with a general assurance of the sincerity of our intentions as suggested above.Copy No *It/
It will in any case be desirable to give U Saw something in writing to put on record the result of our conversations with him, in order to avoid the risk of misapprehension onhis. part which might lead him to give a more optimisticpicture of these talks than the facts justify and mightconsequently lead to misunderstanding in Burma.If the Cabinet approve of the proposal to give ageneral and quite non-committal assurance it might beincluded in a letter putting the results of our talks on record.   I attach the draft of a letter of the kind which Ithink might be sent to him.   As will be seen, it emphasises the difficulties of making a promise which would prejudge the conclusions to be reached in the post-war discussions.In its last two paragraphs it contains an assurance of a kind which might possibly be helpful to him without committing us on any particular issues.   The object of thelast paragraph is to relieve his mind of the fear that,even if on the merits of the case a certain measure of advance were found after the war to be justifiable in burma, it might be withheld owing to a parallel advancenot being found practicable in India.If the Cabinet approve of the provisional draft i suggest that U Saw might be informed of the proposed statement in order to obtain his reactions and see whether he considers that it would be helpful from his point ofview and whether he has any minor suggestions to make.    Iwould then report the result to the next Cabinet with aview to a final decision.L. 3 .A.BURMA OFFICE.28th October 1941.
DRAFT   LETTER   TO   U SAW,Your visit to this country has provided anopportunity tor you to state your views as to themethod of approach to the constitutional problem in burma which will arise for discussion after the war,and for me to make clear, as I hope I have succeeded in doing, the sincerity of the intentions of His majesty&apos;s government on this subject.    I feel that the opportunitythus afforded for an exchange of information and ideashas been of great benefit.In the midst of the life and death struggle inwhich this country and Burma, and indeed the whole causeof free government in the world, are involved, it is notpossible, as I know you realise, either to enter uponthe detailed examination and discussion required forthe solution of these important problems or to anticipate or prejudge conclusions which must themselvesbe affected by that examination and by the situation atthe end of the war.The general aim of the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment has, however, been made clear in a number ofdeclarations in recent years, the last of which was thatmade by Sir Archibald Cochrane to the Burma Legislatureon 26th August 1940 in the course of which he statedthat His Majesty1s Government will continue to use their best endeavours to promote the attainment ofDominion status as being the objective of Burma1sconstitutional progress and that immediately the war is brought to a victorious end they will be willing todiscuss the problems to be solved in Burma.It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat this discussion, to be conducted in collaboration with representatives of Burma, should cover all questions relevant to the methods by which the attainment of this declared aim can be facilitated andexpedited, with a view to removing to the efullest extent that may be found practicable such limitationsas stand in the way of the assumption by the people of burma of complete self-government within the BritishCommonwealth.I may add that His Majesty&apos;s Government considerthat the conclusions reached on the questions to bediscussed should be based on the merits of those questions themselves as affecting Burma and her relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government, and will not allow them to be prejudiced in any way by the positionin regard to the solution of similar problems elsewhere.
