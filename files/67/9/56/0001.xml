Joint Memorandum by the Home secretary and Minister of  . .  &apos;Home Security, &quot;the Minister of Health, and the Secretary &apos;of. State for Scotland.1.    The recent heavy and continuous attacks upon Plymouth,Mersey side-, and other target areas have been following by large&quot;in and out&quot; movements of population.      At one time about 45,000people were moving out from Liverpool and Bcotle each evening andreturning in the morning.      A similar exodus of- substantial thoughsmaller size is taking place from Plymouth&quot;,  Southampton andPortsmouth.    &apos; - . .  .&apos;   &apos;2.    The -present policy is to make sure that, food and shelterare amply provided for all those ;who require succour after a raid.For this purpose rest centres have been made ready in,  and. on the outskirts oftarget towns, and in the surrounding country.5.    The primary object of the rest centres is to give -shelterto the homeless, but after a heavy attack large numbers of peopleresort to the centres, many of whom ar^ not.homeless but wish to beaway from the target- area at&quot;night.:     Whilethli&quot;attacks last,&quot; andfor a period after they have ceased, it is impossible to prevent &apos;this.      Indeed,  it is frequently necessary to assist &quot;the in and&quot;&quot;&quot;out &quot;movement by making special transport arrangements, -and anyone who comes to a rest centre is admitted without question. -     Thepolicy is to clear the rest centres as rapidly as possible bybilleting in order that they may be free to receive fresh arrivalsif the attacks continue, &quot;and as soon as conditions begin to return -to normal,;every effort is made to induce those who have homes togo to,  to return to them,4. .. The services provided have, in most cases, met theneeds, though in some areas there has been undue pressure- onthe rest centres.      Accordingly arrangements are being made atonce to increase- considerably the number of rest centres in those areas.      In areas-where billeting is difficult, it is hoped toprovide,  so far as may. bu- practicablehutted camps or hostelsto which persons can be passed on from, the rest centres. .-5.    The question now-arises whether the existing policy shouldbe extended and. official arrangements made for persons who are nothomeless to go out regularly from target areas and sleep in saferdistricts.      It is understood that the matter.has already beenconsidered at a meeting of Ministers held on Thursday,  the 22ndMay,- and that the Minister of Labour and National Servicevvasasked,  as Chairman of the Production Executive,  to consult theMinister: of Works and. Buildings and the other Ministers concerned and to report on the- possibility of providing temporary living accommodation and transport facilitia-s so that dock workers couldbe housed: at some distance from the dangerous port areas.WAR    CABINET.IN-..AND OUT MOVEMENT of population -FROM TARGET AREAS.
6.    The Cabinet the offeefwhich &quot;theadc-pUou ..-orfc&apos;;&apos;this proposal night have on nor ale.      It nay he thoughtthat an organise:, in and out movement from target.-towns would.bea retreat from danger,  and a step towards defeat or capitulation-,&apos;moreover the effect on fire bomb fighting within the- town -must&quot;, bekept in nine.      On the otbefhanf; &quot;anything that could be done toensure proper rest for essential workers would, no doubt, assistproduction.     A sc^^6-;Vw^gE;;ena^^^;^^&apos;k^^s to . go out in turn for short periods:, of rest rd grit &quot;be&quot;&apos;&apos;Tr6&quot;&apos;i26Ti^&apos;diam-aging &quot;to nor ale than therelief&quot;of troops from a front line trench;  if it could be appliedequitably among all classes of the population, but a government scheme which created a privileged class night well have a serious effect on the morale cf those outside It.&quot;7.    Whatever view nay be taken.of the effect.,on morale, itwould certainly be impracticable to provide accommodation On the outskirts of a target town for the whole or any large part&apos;of thepopulation of the town.      There are,  for example,, 20,000 dockyardworkers in Plymouth, - and if an attempt were made to glved-acconmo-dation to these nen and their families outside the towrfit wouldbe necessary to find room for some 50,000 persons. ; Moreover any scheme for a regular movement of large.numbers of workers wouldinvolve serious additional demands, on transport.      Similar diffi-culties; would arise in rehousing the families of 17,000 dockersat Liverpool, over -4,000 at Hull and 3*500- in Glasgow.^-&apos;-8. Accommodation could, no doubt, b.o provided for a limited number of workers .and their families -in camps or hostels. Itwould be easier to house them in this way,&apos;.&quot;than bydbilleting,because billeting would have to be compulsory^ and householdersmight strenuously resist a scheme providing for a constant success:::of new arrivals, including men, and lacking -the sentimental appeal ::the horseless..  : - -----       .       .,- &apos;&apos; &apos;    .       .     ; .- :      &apos;9.    Even a limited scheme would raise formidable difficulties:-(a) Would it be possible to provide a scheme for a - sectionof the -population without starting a demand for accomnc-clation that could never by met?(b) Could a scheme be provided for selected families whileother women and children remained in the town?   would it not at least be necessary to offer to evacuate, and find billets for,  all women and children?     This is,in fact, done in the.period immediately following a heavy attach, but such an offer, if extended as apermanent arrangement to all target ,areas, would break the Evacuation Scheme.10.    It is, cf course, possible that more intense attacks thanhave yet been experienced might destroy the homes of a large partof the population of a target town.      To guard.&apos; against this,&quot;cushion&quot; areas are being defined round towns likely to be so attack the accommodation in these areas is being surveyed and power is to &apos;taken to remove from them, if this ever becomes necessary, allpersons other than -householders - an&quot;  their relatives,  and workers.11.    The views of the Ministry, of Home Security,  the Ministryof Health and the Scottish Office are:-.&apos;(I) Full provision must be made for  the homeless;
(2) Rest centres must be provided in sufficient&apos;     numbers to enable all persons, whether hone-lessshelter for a period.:Cciv8 ioo-or not, toafter a heavy raid;(5) Apart from this, no organised arrangements undera Government Scheme should be made for the in and out movement cf persons who are not homeless;(4) Power must be taken to enable accoirmodation in&quot;cushion&quot; areas to be cleared for homelessworkers, should this be necessary.H.M.E.B.T.
