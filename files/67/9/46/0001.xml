sTliis estimated requirement for Smoke Screen units is at present being reconsidered.- -THIS pOGUJ^m IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS&apos; BRIT WNIG MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.      . COPY NO.  j) tlJ7.P.G. (M )h-S, &apos;6th May, 1941.WAR   CABINET.Provision of men for the Army (General Service).,Smoke Screen Units and Civil Defence DutiesApril to September,, J,9fcKMemorandum by Minister of Labour^and National Service^1,     The Cabinet decided on 24-th February last that the. Army intake for the six months April to September should be settled between the Secretary of Statefor War and myself and that a report should be made in due course to theWar Cabinet *     Discussions have since taken place between my Department, theWar Office and the Ministry of Zone Security.     This memorandum deals only with the June quarter (that is to say the current quarter ending in June).For reasons given below it is difficult e.t this stage to make definitearrangements for the September quarter.20 The same sources which supply men for the Array (General Service) must alsosupply the needs of the Army Smoke Screen Units, and the Civil Defence services under the new Bill fox- making service in the latter services compulsory.3.     The best estimate that can now be ms.de of the number of men available forcalling i.ip in the June quarter to the Services set out in the preceding paragraph is approximately 100,000.     This total, in addition to the 1921 classregistered in February, Schedule releases, and 15*000 carried over from theprevious quarter, includes 25,000 from the 1503 class registered on 12th April.The registration of the 1903 class was advanced from June to April in orderto make them available at need in the June quarter.     It is most undesirable,  -if it can be avoided, to call these older men up at short notice but the calling up of some of them in this quarter now seems unavoidable.4-     It is understood that the requirements for Smoke Sci-een Units and civil Defence Services during the June quarter will beSmoke Screen Units       19*500 hCivil Defence Services 20,00039,500After allowing for these requirements, I have agreed to try to supply the Armywith 50,500 men for General Service in the June quarter, making a totalcall-up of 90,000 from the 100,000 men available leaving 10,000 as a workingbalance to carry over to the following quarter.     The 19*500 men24 forSmoke Screen units will also be part of the Army and will release for general service 7*500 men already serving in such units.5.     Thus the real number of men being mo.de available for General service during the June quarter would be 58,000.     In addition the Army will be taking a number of men (at present estimated at nearly 10,000) from the Tradesmen&apos;sRegister.6, The balance of 10,000 is exceedingly small and is in fact below theminimum which we should seek to carry over as a working balance and as areserve for emergencies.
7*     On 27th January the Cabinet authorised registration of the remainingmen subject&quot; to military service in the following order - 19, 37a 38, 39s 4-0*Those who were 19.by the end of 1940 (the 1921 class), were registered on the22nd february,      The 1903 class (the 37&apos;s) were registered on 12th April.-I am proposing to register the 1902 class (the 38&apos;s) on 17th May and.the1901 and 1900 classes (the 39&apos;s and 40&apos;s) probably on the 31st May and the1Ath J\ine respectively^     I also propose to register the men born in thefirst half of 1922, who will be 19 by the end of June next, in July or soon after so that as many of them as possible will be available in the Septemberquarter.     My intention is to call up the latter group before the 1902., 1901and 1900 classesJ   the registration of the latter classes is taking placeearlier than had been intended in order to see how many of them can betransferred to essential work in industry so as to release younger men forthe Armed Forces *     \ifith so many uncertain factors it is not possible tomake a firm estimate of the number of men likely to be available in the september quarter for general service in the Army&quot;$ for civilian, defence andas a &quot;working balance and reserve for emergencies, but If the whole of thefirst half of the 1922 class can be called up (and that will depend upon theactual date of registration, the progress of medical examination, eto*, -)there should be about 93*000 without counting upon any men from the 1902$1901 and 1900 classeso     The maximum yield from these oaasses for general service in the Army would not be more than 40*000 and this will certainly be very substantially reduced by transfers to essential industry, whileany compensating release of younger men from indusixy cannot be even roughlyestimated.80     But in view of the extreme and increasing stringency of the man-power position,, as revealed by our latest review?. I hesitate to undertake a definitcommitment for the September quarter without consideration of possiblerequirements beyond that(initdo) Es3*6th May;, 1941H.Q.150-70 E,K,2o
