SECRET1JiF.(G) (U) 29March 1st, 1941.Copy No.58WAR cabinet ministerial BROADCASTSMemorandum by the Minister of InformationIt has been pointed out to me by one of the principal newspapereditors that Ministers are sometimes inclined to retain items of news for inclusion in their own broadcasts which might otherwise havebeen released earlier.Not only does this transgress the rule by which news issimultaneously issued to Press and B.B.C. , but the result in manycases is that the news item is not only delayed but obtains a lesswide public than it otherwise might. \Owing to shortness of notice it is not always possible to announce Ministerial broadcasts before they are delivered, so thatthey do not always obtain as large a public as they should.     If anews item, for instance, were announced in the morning press, togetherwith a statement that the Minister concerned would broadcast on thesubject that evening, not only would the news be known earlier and more widely, but the Minister&apos;s broadcast would probably obtain a largerpublic.I am sure that my colleagues will bear this aspect of the matter in mind.D.C.March 1st, 1941.
