SECRET.W.P.(G)(41)  137.25th November, 1941.WAR CABINET.MAN POWER.Scheme of Training for Boys.Memorandum by the Lord President of theCouncil.1. At tneir Meeting on the lOtn November the War-Cabinet invited the Lord President&apos;s Committee, inconsultation with the President of the Board of education and other Ministers .concerned,  to work out a scheme for providing some form of training for boys after they leaveschool and before they become liable to compulsory national service.      The scheme was  to be so devised asto enable boys to volunteer at a suitable age for whole-time service in A.D.G.B.  in the neighbourhood of their homes (W.M.(4l)  110th Conclusions, Minute l).My Committee have considered this question.,  inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned,  and thefollowing recommendations are submitted on their behalf.SERVICE IN A.D.G-.3.2. Having regard particularly to the difficulties experienced in recruiting boys for Young Soldiers&apos;Battalions,  the Army Council would be reluctant to agreethat boys under 18 should be enlisted in the Army forwhole-time service inA.D.G.3.The War Office are, however,  arranging to use theHome Guard, on a part-time basis, for operational duties in A.D.G.B.      This development, by releasing full-time Armypeisonnel from these duties, will go some way to meet thesnortfall in the recruitment of A.T.S.  for service inA.D,G8B*Boys are already allowed to enrol in trie Home Guardat age 17.      The War Office now propose to reduce the age-limit to 16, so that boys of 16-18 may play tneir part in helping to man the searchlights and anti-ai&quot;craftbatteries on a part-time basis.COPY NO.

My Committee concur in the view taken by tne WarOffice, and recommend that the enrolment of boys aged16-18 in the Koine  Guard, for part-time service  inA.D.G.B.,  should be extended to the fullest extentpracti cable.CADET TRAINING FOR B0Y3.3. There are in England, Wales and Scotland about1,448,500 boys between 14 and 18.From this total we- may deduct those who are receiving full-time education,  those  in the Forces,  andthose who are already undergoing training or discipline of the kind which the War Cabinet nad in mind -Receiving full-time education 274,500In Army, Navy or Air Foice 15,0 30In A.T.C.  units not associatedwitn schools 155,000In Sea and Army Cadets units notassociated with schools 20,000In Boy Scouts&apos; Movement 82,000In Boys&apos; Brigade and ChurchLads&apos;  Brigade 65,000In Home Guard (additional tothe above ) 180/000769,500In addition, about 127,000 ooys aged 14-18 arc covered bythe National Association of Boys&apos; Clubs and&apos; the Y.Ivi.C.A-. iand possibly another 130,000 are associated with otherclubs or youth schemes under  the aegis of the Cnurches orthe education authorities.There will be some overlapping between tnese figures,particularly as regards boys still at school,  and allowing for this element of duplication it may be estimated that of the total of 1,448,500 boys aged 14-18 something like amillion are either leceiving some form of training or are recovered by clubs or other agencies which bring them undereducational influences after leaving school and can put  themin toucn with opportunities for taking their part in national Service.4. It would be wasteful not  to use  tue existing organisations wiiichlie ready to our hands,  and my committee therefore recommend tnat we should build ontrie foundations laid by trie existing Cadet formationsand tne voluntary youth organisations.The War Office propose a substantial expansion or tneArmy Cadets.    They have it in mind to increase the  total,number of these cadets from about 23,000 to something over100,000 - tne expansion being carried out as rapidly asaccommodation,  training facilities and instructors canbe made available.

When the War Office proceed with, this plan, theAir Ministry would wish to undertake a correspondingexpansion of the A.T.G. by reducing the lower age limitfrom 16 to 14.The Admiralty also contemplate some expansion of theSea Gadets*By these means we shall expand to the limit of available resources the facilities for pre-rnilitary trainingin organisations directly controlled by the fightingServices*5* On the civil side, we shall seek to expand the voluntary organisations and to relate their work more closely to theneeds of national service.Since the outbreak of war much has been lone, under the auspices of the Board of Education and the scottish education Department, to co-ordinate and extend theactivities of the various organisations concerned in promoting the welfare of young people after working hoursc     ANational Youth Committee has bean appointed for this purpose,and local Youth Committees have been set up by educationauthorities throughout the country-,       Through this machinerythe Board of Education and the Scottish Education department will stimulate the voluntary organisations to greateractivity and will guide their efforts into channels which will contribute more directly to the national war effort.      10will be possible in many cases to arrange for these organisations to provide some preliminary training, notnecessarily military in character, which would be usefullater on when the boys reach an age at which they can undertakesome definite form of national service.     For example,  some .elementary instruction could usefully be given in theservicing and maintenance of motor vehicles;    andarrangements might also be made for many of these organisations to give their members somes basic training In Civil defence work,6* How are we to ensure that boys will take advantageof these increased facilities for training?We recommend that all boys between 16 and. 18should be required.by a Defence Regulation to register,Registration would be carried out, by half-year age-groups,through the machinery of the Ministry of Labour;    and the particulars would be passed to the Youth Service Committeeof the education authorities.      The Committees would thenarrange for the boys to be interviewed and would encouragethose who were not already members of some organisation or doing useful work of some kind to join one or other of the organisations through which they could obtain the trainingrequired to fit them for national service by this means large numbers Of recruits would be foundfer the Fighting Services,  the Home Guard and other organisations directly controlled by the Services,      Aconsiderable stimulus would also be given to the work of the voluntary organisations on the civil side,      For the first time the Youth Committees would be able to establish direct contact with every boy in the 16-18 age-group;    and there isno doubt that this would greatly increase the value and effectiveness of their work.

7* We do riot recommend a comprehensive system oxcompulsory training - partly because it would be impracticable to fit such a system into the frame-work of the existing organisations, on which we must in present circumstancesroly, and partly because we believe that the applicationof compulaon might provoke controversy and v/ould tend toimpair industrial.efficiency.We believe that by an extension of the voluntaryprinciple on the lines recommended, coupled with compulsory registration, the increase (a)  in the numberof boys aged 16-18 drawn under some form of supervision and (b) in the amount of pre-rnilitary training given will proceed as rapidly as is practicable.Along those lines we can advance steadily and by stages.We recommend that the requirement of registrationshould be applied to girls,  as well as boys, betweenthe ages of 16 and 18;    and similar arrangements forinterviev/ing girls in this ago-group could then beundertaken at a later stage&quot;with a view to encouragingthem to undertake industrial employment or some voluntary workof national importance.If at a later date it becomes necessary to carrymatters even further,  the fact that this requirement has been imposed and registration has been carried out will facilitate any further development which may be required.&amp;0 Although our recommendations have boon confinedin the main to the 16-18 age-group, wc have not overlooked &apos;the needs       the younger boys aged 11--16,,      Registrationv/ould be inappropriate in their cose;    but we believe thatthe oxpansion of the Cadets,  which recruit at the ago of14,  and the stimulus which our proposals will give to thework of the voluntary organisations generally, will go far to meet the needs of those younger boys.(Intld.)
