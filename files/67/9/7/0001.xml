SECRET..W.P. (G-H4.1 )7, . COPY NO._C T*January 1.5th,. 1941. * ^-WAR   G A B I ..N E T.     -&apos;   * AIR RAID SHELTER&apos; POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister of Home Security,1,      In. the paper on Air Raid Shelter Policy (W.P.(G)(40) 275)which I circulated to the Cabinet on October 29th, I described the plans I was then making for the provision of air raid shelter.Developments of public opinion and technical research have sinceled me to review shelter policy again.      My present shelter plansinvolve no major departure from existing policy but include some new features for which I should like the endorsement of the Cabinet.2,      The: proposal,contained in my previous paper included aproposal that additional shelter should be provided where naturalfeature&quot;, lent themselves to the work.      The Cabinet approved thisproposal and it is now being actively pursued through the LocalAuthorities.      The possibility of building shelters of massiveconstruction,   (commonly, perhaps not altogether accuratelyregarded as bomb-proof), which was in its experimental stage, inOctober, has now been thoroughly examined.      I am advised thatshelters of this type would cost about  25 per person and requirelabour and materials which would limit the monthly output on themost optimistic forecast to accommodation for 100,000 people.Apart from the outlay, I see grave difficulties in deciding who should benefit from this specially safe form of protection and myconclusion is that I. must reject proposals of this kind.3,      There remains the wide range of shelter of the present standardof protection and here I have some modifications to suggest.Street surface shelters do not appear to be popular with the publicwho prefer basement shelters,  sometimes of a dubious character;    onthe other hand, they have not been extensively tried out with provision of lighting, heating and bunking.      There is.an increasing demand for shelter in the home.      Finally, the position of those sections of the public whose income just precludes them from a free^issue of shelter requires consideration.      In considering the solution to these problems,  I have to consider not only what the public wantbut what is good for them;    and I have to reconcile the sometimesconflicting aims of shelter policy, that is to say the provision ofa type of ehelter which will satisfy the public  (which requires time)and the provision of as much shelter as possible for immediateprotection.  .4..    Street Surface Shelters   were built at a time when materials ofall sorts were at a premium and, besides their restricted space,they are comfortless and ill suited for prolonged occupancy.Moreover the public are distrustful of the protection they afford.I cannot however afford to do without these  shelters and I thereforeproposea (a)    to proceed as rapidly as  possible with the.   re-conditioning of existi:ng surface shelters;
(b)    to build all new surface shelters to a newdesign which allows increased comfort and, by thesubstitution of reinforced concrete for brick wallgreater strength.5.      Large basement shelters:  I shall intensify my efforts tosecure more of these, especially in framed.buildings, on thelines indicated in my previous paper,  even at the cost of somedisturbance of the ordinary user.5,      Shelter in the home:    The Anderson shelter was originally intended&quot; for indoor use but for a number of reasons including thedanger of fire an outdoor variant was adopted.      Experience hasshown that the objections to the indoor use of the Andersonor somewhat similar shelter are not so serious as was thought and two designs have been produced which can be erected indoorswithout support.      These new types,  although they may give slightly less protection than a well covered Anderson shelter out of doors,&quot;would fill the needs of a large section of the public, especially the middle class.      One design allows the use of the shelter aspart of the furniture of the room.7..      I regard shelters of this type as of the first importance andwish to provide them on a big scale.-     Each shelter will use over  cwts  of steel and will allow at a pinch two adults and one to two children to sleep inside.      For an outlay of about 65,000 tonsof steel, as a first instalment, I could therefore produce400,000 shelters with accommodation for at least 1,000,000personsc      I should wish to complete such a programme within thefirst three months of production and thereafter at a similar orincreasing ratec      From enquiries I believe that manufacture canbe arranged provided steel is supplied and if the Cabinet approvesmy policy I shall require their direction that the steel bemade available.,8.      Shelter for the lower-middle classes.Finally.  I think that the Government must accept a largermeasure of responsibility with respect to the lower middle classes,All insured persons are eligible for free shelter but in fact onlyinsured manual workers have been supplied with free shelterirrespective of earning.      The insured non-manual worker is not provided with free shelter unless his earnings are under  250- ayear.      This was always, I think,  a little anomalous and in thepast 18 months the scale has tipped further against the poorersections of the black coated population.      There has of course beer,nothing to prevent their struggling for places in public shelters,but shelter at the house had, and has,  to be provided at their own expense.      In my view it is in the highest degree desirable to -increase the limit for the free provision of shelter from  250 to 350*      This, together with the fact that the new indoor shelterwill be placed on sale at cost,  ( 5 to  6),  to those who remainineligible for free shelter, should greatly ease the position ofthis section of the community, which though the least articulate,is not the least important.9.      The foregoing plans I intend to apply, with the fullestintensity,  to the heavily bombed areas and to those areas which,in the view of the Air Ministry,  are most likely to be attacked.Over a considerable range of areas, which I need not attempt to define, however,  I think that on a realistic view it must be
recognised that the risk is not at this stage, such as to justify-large scale shelter construction..      In these areas, I proposethat a. certain minimum of shelter should &quot;be constructed.10.      Conclusions..I ask for a general endorsement of the policy I have outlined in this paper and in particular for the agreement ofmy colleagues:(i)    that proposals for &quot;building shelters of massiveconstruction should be rejected;(ii)    that steel should be made available to carry outthe programme outlined in paragraph 7 for theprovision of steel shelters indoors;(iii)      that the limit of income for the provision of free shelter for insured persons should beraised from  250 to  350 per annum.H.M.filINISTRY OF HOME SECURITY.January 15th, 1941.
