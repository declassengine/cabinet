For various, reasons, of&apos; which the chief is that5.in.the-mainadditional supplies .of men for the. Armed Forces can only bo obtained from.amongst men who have.- hitherto been reserved for industry and who: can only-be withdrawn from,-:industry gradually and as substitutes are made available,.-Ido not see. my way to.; guarantee to provide as many as 100,000 monin the..&apos;September quarter.     The Secretary of State was able to help me by agreeing to reduce the quota for the September quarter to 82fj0005 leaving 66,000 forthe December quarter^ of whom 35*000 would be provided in October,     Theproposed quotas for the last six months of the year are accordingly as followsJuly 27,000August 27,000September 30,000October - 35,000November 16,000December 15300OTotal        150,0003*     The agreement described in the preceding paragraph was independent ofreplacements for war casualties and since it was reached I have been asked toprovide 20,000   additional men, if possible in the September quarter, toreplace casualties in the Middle East,     For the reasons already given I amunable to guarantee a delivery of these men in the September quarter but have undertaken in the circumstances to do my best.4*     In addition to the numbers referred to above I have also to provide forthe Army 11,000 men in respect of the fire watching duties at the westernports which, as the result of the meeting of the Lord President&apos;s Committee onthe 26th May, it was decided that the Army should undertake.

2ncL Julyy 19M^ E.B.H^9.66-80 G*K*2.5*     The Secretary of State for far has made it clear that the acceptance by.the Army Council of the figure of 2,195*000 (or 2,2.06,000 including the11,000 mentioned in para 4 above) as the male strength of the Army is dependent upon their obtauoing the large ambers of women whbri they require forthe A,T.S0     The Secretary of State lias estimated his requirements in the next1.2 months to be an additional 180^000 women, of whom a considerable proportion&apos;will be employed on operational or semi-operational duties *     Allowing forwastage this will involve the &apos; recruitment and training of about 220,000 women of whom not less than 100,000 will be wanted by the end of 1941*     Heestimated that the rate of intake should be raised to 12,000 a month by mid July, 15,000 by 1st September and still further later in. the year.6o     I have accordingly considered what steps could be taken to stimulate and encourage recruitment to the A,T.So and, after discussion with the Yfar Office.,the.following arrangements are being madeoWithout stopping the direct enrolment of volunteers who go to Militaryrecruiting centres^ the Local Offices of the Ministry of Labour and National service are being made responsible for the main task of finding the numbers required*These Local Offices will in future be in a position to accept applications forenrolment subject only to medical rejection or, in exceptional cases only, torejection by the A.T,Sa authorities for special reasons and after consultationwith the Ministry of Labour and National Service Local Office.     The Ministry ofLabour in co-operation, with the. Ministry of Information will be responsible forthe publicity campaign and the publicity conducted by the War Office will bemade part of this co-ordinated scheme in order that then; may be no overlappingor competitions,     Apa.rt from general publicity the Local Offices of theMinistry of Labour and National Service are being instructed to bring the A.T.S.urgently to the notice of all women ceiled for interview as a result of registration under the. Registration for Employment&quot; Order.     Furthermore, for thetime being, women-who volunteer to join the A.T.S. will not be prevented from doing so on the. ground that they are in s. reserved occupation,, save those in asmall selected list of occupations in which it would be unwise to allow anydepletion., .    ,
