THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS I,RIT.al;T,0 MAJESTY,*S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.gist November, 19 Ul. COPY NO.     *J ,WAR..,CABJHETeREPLACEMENT OP ALLIED TONNAGE.MEMORANDUM BY MINISTER OP WAR TRANSPORT.lo     My predecessor submitted proposals, in W,P.  (G)  (kl) 32,for a scheme to permit Allied Governments to replace part oftheir tonnage lost before the end of 19UO, from ships built forGovernment account before the end of .1941? and from second-handships bought by this Governments     These proposals were submittedto the Lord president&apos;s committee and approved by that Committee,subject to certain modifications, on 28th March, 191+1,20     The proposals were put to the Allies in a Memorandum inApril.     Discussions which have taken place since have prepare the way for a final settlement, but on the important point of transfer of flag there remains a difference of view.     Each ofthe Allies concerned has taken up this point and I am satisfiedthat I cannot achieve a settlement without a concession to theirviews; and also that a settlement must be reached in order tokeep the goodwill of the Allies, on whose shipping we greatlyrely*     The Norwegian Government is pressing me for a very urgentdecisiona3o     As regards transfer of flag the proposals put to theAllies were as follows:*(a) The ships were to remain on the British Register forthe duration of the Ware(b) They were to be requisitioned by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand compensated on the same terms as other british vessels so requisitioned, subject to adjustment to allow for necessary extra expenses of employing Allied crews.(c) They could be transferred to the flag of the AlliedGovernment to whom they wore sold when that Governmentresumed the administration of their own territory, onthe understanding that that Government would agree toco-operate in the post-war problem of re-victuallingEuropeMy discussions with the allied Governments have shown thatthey attach fundamental importance to securing immediate transfer to their own flags of vessels sold to them under the scheme.They claim that their prestige in their own countries and amongsttheir seamen requires this a      It is difficult to resist this argument as the main object of the scheme was to answer the criticism that Allied Governments were losing ships in ourservice, while only our own losses were being replaced.     my discussions have also shown that it will be impracticable to manthese ships with Allied crews except under Allied flags.      I need the help of the Allied resources of man power experienced at sea to get the new ships rapidly into service0I now ask authority to modify the original proposals on thispoint and to agree that any vessel, purchased by an AlliedGovernment under the scheme may be transferred to the Allied flag

if and when a complete Allied crew can be provided to manhere     This will be on condition that all the shipspurchased by the Allies under the Scheme, whether under british or Allied flag, will be chartered to us for the duration of the war on the same terms as for Britishrequisitioned ships, save for an adjustment to take accountof any necessary extra expenses of crew.The Allied Governments are to buy out-right shipsallotted them under the scheme and the ships are to remain the property of the Governments until after the war.As regards the post-war situation, to which theLord president&apos;s Committee called particular attention, theAllied Governments have now accepted the principle of collaboration in the post-war problem of re-victuallingEurope in the Resolution adopted at the Inter-Allied Meetingat St, James&apos;s Palace on September 20th.     In this respectships sold to the Allied Governments under the ReplacementScheme would be on the same footing as all other Allied ships,but I should propose, in making the concession in regard toflag, to emphasise to each Allied Government ourexpectation that the ships will be available for there-victualling of Europe after the war.ilSTRY OF WAR TRANSPORT21st November, 19U1,
