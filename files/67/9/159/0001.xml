S E C R E ToW.P.   (G)   (41)  159o2 3RD DECEMBER,  1941 o COPY NO,   S^JWAR CABINET-DECLARATION OP WAR WITH BULGARIA,Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council,At noon on Saturday 13th December, Professor Piloffannounced to the Bulgarian Parliament that Bulgaria had that morning declared war on Britain and the U.S,A,      The UnitedStates Minister in Sofia informed his Government of this announcement and added that he expected to receive an officialnotification at any moment:    meanwhile he was handing over british and United States interests to the Swiss,The official notification promised by the United StatesMinister has so far not been forthcomings     Nevertheless in.reply to a question the United States Government have told us that they consider themselves in a state of war with bulgaria on the strength of Professor Piloff&apos;s announcement.Owing to the absence of official information we havebeen unable so far formally to recognise that a state of war    iexists between this country and Bulgaria,      This has beencausing us considerable embarrassment since the Greek and,to a lesser extent, the Yugoslav Government are becoming increasingly restive0      The Greek Government in particularhad urged us even before the Bulgarian declaration of war to declare war on Bulgaria and were much upset by our refusal to do so,.     Now that Bulgaria has declared war on us they are 1surprised and annoyed that we should not have declared war inreturn.We asked the Soviet Government in October how theywould react to a British declaration of war on Bulgaria,    Theygreplied that while the policy of the Soviet Government was not&quot;to declare war on Bulgaria since this would only play intothe German hands by strengthening the Bulgarian Government,they would nevertheless not object to our doing so,-   Up till now the attitude of the Turkish Governmenthas been that they would prefer that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould not be at war with Bulgaria.,      They have clung to thefond hope that so long as Bulgaria is not technically at warwith Great Britain she will be able to maintain a certainamount of independence vis-a-vis of Germany, and resistGermany^s efforts to use her as a spearhead in an eventualattack on Turkeyo      It is clear, however, that the TurkishGovernment must reconcile themselves to the obvious fact thatBulgaria is now a full and willing ally of Germany,      In anycase their hopes of a &quot;neutral&quot; Bulgaria are hardly a sufficiejreason why we should allow the present undefined andinconvenient state of affairs to continue any longer.

To sum up, I consider that His Majesty;s Governmentshould announce that they regard a state of war as havingexisted from the date of the announcement in the BulgarianParliament, and that they should Issee a notification in theLondon Gazette accordingly0     This course would be in line with what the Americans have done0The draft of a notification for the London Gazette isattached,,(Initialled)    J3A*Foreign Office* 3*W..l.,23RD DECEMBER,  1941*ANNEX.Notification of a State of War with Bulgaria.His Majesty&apos;s Government have been informed by theGovernment of the United States, who were in charge ofBritish interests in Bulgaria, that a declaration ofwar by that country on Great Britain was announced inthe Bulgarian Parliament on December 13thc      His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have so far received no official communication to this effect from the Bulgarian Government, but in viewof the above information it is hereby notified that astate of war exists between the two countries as from december 13th,
