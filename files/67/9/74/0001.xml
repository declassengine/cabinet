DOCMiinr IS THE property op HIS britannic majesty&apos;s government)s gJLE e Tow.Eo(g)(.4l)74o copy no.__5th august. 1941.&quot;war cabinet civil service leave.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The War Cabinet decided * on 27th March, 1941, thatgeneral Civil Service leave should be limited to one wee3&amp;      TheStaff Side of the NationalWhitSoy council protested against thisdecision, and as a result of reconsideration by the Lord President&apos;sCommittee they were told that, while the War Cabinet maintained their decision, it had always been implicit in that decision that the position might be reviewed later in the year and thatthe Government re-affirmed their intentions in that respect.2.     I understand that Heads of Departments are disturbed at theominous signs of fatigue evident throughout a good de.ajj of theService as a result of long-continued strain and that this is not confined to the higher grades.     Arrangements have recently beenmade for a general increase in hours in an effort to economiseman-power,; this has been willingly accepted by the staff, but it makes it all the more necessary tiiat a reasonable amount of leaveshould be granted.     All Departments &quot;and all grades are affected:the Post Office staff, for example, including subordinate staff,have been under great strain and the sickness returns are causinguneasinesso3.     Representations on the matter have been made to the Treasury&quot;by the Staff Side of the National Whitley council they are, ofcourse., in close touch with all grades and they reflect a widespread feeling that in the interests of health and efficiencysome further leave should be granted.     The subject is ofimportance psychologically as well as physically.4.     It is advisable now to settle what is to be done.      i recommend that - subject to the requirements of the work, and ofcourse, to fresh emergencies - Departments should be authorisedto grant a further week (making two v/eeks in all) before thewinter.:.     The decision ought to be made known soon in order thatdetailed arrangements may be made in the Departments.(ltd.)
