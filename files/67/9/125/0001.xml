Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET. Copy No.     i J-W.P. (G) (M) 125.October 30, 1941.WAR CABINET.AIR SERVICE  TO  THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies as Chairman of the overseas Mails Committee.THE Overseas Mails Committee have reached the conclusion that no sub-stantial improvement in the mail services to the Middle East can be achieved without a considerable increase in the aircraft capacity operating the Services.2. Surface mails by sea now take 1 (P. weeks to reach the forces in theMiddle East and 11J weeks to reach India, and the Committee are satisfied thatthere is no prospect of improving mail services by surface routes.3.   Existing air mail services to the Middle East are as follows : (a) Air Mail Letters. These are sent by sea to West Africa and thence hjland plane to Cairo, and the time taken in transmission is six weeks.(b) &quot; Thin &quot; Postcard Service from the United Kingdom to His Majesty&apos;forces in the Middle East. Up to 3^- million postcards have been dispatched, but the air capacity per flight allocated for this service has not proved sufficient to cope with the demands.(c) The Airgraph Service between the United Kingdom and His Majesty&apos;forces in the Middle East. This service has handled 2,700.000 letters,but it is only a palliative and not a solution of the problem, as itcannot deal with many types of correspondence.4. In addition, air conveyance is provided for a number of high prioritypassengers and there is an intensified demand for the carriage of officialdespatches, propaganda material for the Ministry of Information, manufacturingdata which the Ministry of Supply require to send to Eastern Supply Groupcountries, and other urgent freight, spares, equipment, &amp;c.5. Details are given in Annex I of the nature of the freight which Govern-ment Departments require to be carried by an air service from this country tothe Middle East. (The question of route is discussed later.) The maximumweekly capacity which with present resources can be provided for this purpose is approximately 6,600 lbs. Details are given in Annex II of the estimate of capacity required weekly to provide an adequate service, the total capacityrequired amounting to 21,160 lbs.6. The effective fleet of aircraft hitherto allotted to the United Kingdom-West Africa service is as follows : (a) 3 S. 30&apos;s, which have been overworked, with resulting loss of efficiency;(&amp;) 3 Boeings which have to be flown back to the United States for overhaulafter each trip;(c) 1 Catalina on temporary loan from the R.A.F.; and(d) 1 P.B.Y. Flying Boat of the old type-Guba.[23089]
The maximum effective capacity of these aircraft has been quite insufficient to carry the minimum needs of the Post Office for mails and of GovernmentDepartments for official purposes.7. Arrangements are now being made for the operation of a twice-weeklyair service to and from the Middle East via Gibraltar ,and Malta. This service is only made possible by the diversion from operational duties of certainSunderland flying boats at present stationed at Alexandria, and the transfer tothe Mediterranean route of some of the civil flying boats at present employed ontut; vv est -ti-irican ran.8. This new service will only effect a slight improvement in the position,and cannot possibly provide all the capacity estimated to be required.The Post Office fear that the circumstances which allow a Mediterraneanservice to be operated may prove to be temporary, and that the Sunderlamdsquadron may at any time be diverted from transportation to operational duties;they therefore regard the United Kingdom-West African air route as a vitallink in our communications with the Middle East.Recommendation.9. The Committee consider that the aircraft allotted to our communications with the Middle East should be very considerably increased. They feel bound torecommend that additional aircraft, of whatever suitable type can be provided,sufficient to carry an additional capacity of 14,560 lbs. a week either on the directroute through the Mediterranean, or, should this prove necessary, by the westcoast of Africa route, should be permanently allotted to the United Kingdom-Middle East Services.(Intd.) M.
Nature of the freight which Government Departments require to be carriedto the Middle East by Air : &apos;&apos;(d) Troop mails, which are regarded by the Minister of State and the service authorities as matters of high military importance from the point ofview of maintaining the morale and ease of mind of the troops.(b) Official despatches which cannot be sent by telegraphic means and whichare regarded by the Departments concerned as of great importance.(c) Ministry of Information material consisting of news reels, documentaryfilms, photographs and dummies of periodicals or pamphlets whichmust reach their destination rapidly and regularly if the Ministry&apos;work is to be effective.(d) Manufacturing   information   such   as   drawings,   specifications   and inspection data required in India and the Eastern Group Dominions,particularly Australia, for the stimulation of munitions production.(e) Urgent passengers from the three Services and civil Departments whosepresence in the theatres of war is deemed essential.Weekly capacity provided for these purposes approximately 6,600 lb.ANNEX II.Estimate of capacity required weekly on the United Kingdom-Middle Eastair service for air mails, Government despatches, priority passengers, urgentfreight, &amp;c. : Lb.Air Mails...............      ...... 13,500*Government Departments (Material falling underheads (b), (c), (d) of Annex I) Ministry of Information ...       ...       ...       ... 440Dominions Office (including High commissioners and Ministry of Supply)     ......... 200Colonial Office      ............... 150India and Burma Offices ...       ...       ...       ... 70Ministry of War Transport       ...       ...       ... 100Air Ministry        ............... 100War Office.................. 100Foreign Office       ...       ...       ......       ... 350Admiralty.................. 100Passengers        ...       ...       ...      ...      ...       ... 4,400Urgent Freight ...       ...       ...       ...      ...       ... 1,650Total capacity required...       ...       ...      ...       ...     21,160Capacity now provided...       ...       ...      ...       ...       6,600Additional capacity needed    ...       ...      ...       ...      14,560* This would provide for an air mail service all the way by air to the Middle East and thenceto practically all Empire countries in the Eastern hemisphere for troops&apos; and civil lettersprepaid at a rate of Is. 3d. per half-ounce.
