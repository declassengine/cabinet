No,  776 EMBASSY OF THE UNITE!/ Sin E3OF A1.C3HIOA.LOHDON.September 17 s  1941.Sir,I have the honour to refer to our recent conversationsregarding the possibility of an international agreement on wheat.      In this connection,  I am glad to communicate to youunder instructions of ray Government certain general considerations which indicate the far-reaching importance attached by my Government to the conclusion of a satisfactorywheat agreement.The conclusion at this time of such an agreement is highly desirable from the point of view of wheat alone.Among the objectives of the draft agreement are theexpansion of world trade in wheat through the reduction of import barriers and other means,  the stabilization of suchtrade at prices equitable to both producers and consumers,the adjustment of wheat production,   on a basis of expandedtrade,  from a state of chronic excess to levels in keepingv/ith market requirements,  the maintenance of adequate reserves for use when harvests are inadequate,  and theprovision of supplies for immediate postwar relief.    &apos; Theproposed agreement offers for the first time a real hope thatthe wheat exporting countries may regain a substantial partof their losses (some 200,000,000 bushels) in the european market since the 1920&apos;s, and assures the importing countries ample supplies at fair price regardless offluctuations in output from year to year.It is believed that in the inevitable confusion ofthe period immediately following the cessation of hostilitiesit would be far more difficult than at present to dealwith the wheat problem on the comprehensive basis envisaged in the draft agreement under reference.      Although no one can foretell what the state of the world will be after the warin all essentials the -wheat problem will be the same thenas it is now,  as will be the methods of dealing with it.Indeed, unless a comprehensive agreement is concluded at theearliest practicable date by the governments participating in the current discussions,  it may be anticipated that thewheat problem will become even more acute than it now is,that a most favourable opportunity will have been lost todeal effectively with bhis problem, which is of such greatimportance to all wheat-exporting and importing countries,and that the risk of serious consequences to some if not all of the countries concerned will be greatly magnified.It is of course in the interest of the wheat-exporting countries that European wheat-importing countries shouldlearn as soon as possible of the new policy which they willat the appropriate time be pressed to adopt.      It is before,and not after, their urgent postwar needs have been relieved,that they should appreciate the neces-ity of international collaboration in working out an effective solution of thea&apos;or Id wheat problem.

(W 11359/285/49)No. 776 EMBASSY 0? THE UNITED STATESOF AMERIOA.LONDON.September 17,  1941.Sir,I have the honour to refer to our recent conversationsregarding the possibility of an international agreement on wheat.      In this connection,  I am glad to communicate to youunder instructions of my Government certain general considerations which indicate the far-reaching importance attached by my Government to the conclusion of a satisfactorywheat agreement.The conclusion at this time of such an agreement is highly desirable from the point of view of wheat alone.Among the objectives of the draft agreement are theexpansion of world trade in wheat through the reduction of import barriers and other means,  the stabilization of suchtrade at prices equitable to both producers and consumers,the adjustment of wheat production,  on a basis of expandedtrade, from a state of chronic excess to levels in keeping with market requirements,  the maintenance of adequate reserves for use when harvests are inadequate,  and theprovision of supplies for immediate postwar relief.    &apos; Theproposed agreement offers for the first time a real hope thatthe wheat exporting countries may regain a substantial partof their losses (some 200,000,000 bushels)  in the european market since the 1920&apos;s,  and assures the importing countries ample supplies at fair price regardless offluctuations in output from year to year.It is believed that in the inevitable confusion ofthe period immediately following the cessation of hostilitiesit would be far more difficult than at present to dealwith the wheat problem on the comprehensive basis envisaged in the draft agreement under reference.      Although no one can foretell what the state of the world will be after the warin all essentials the wheat problem will be the same thenas it is now,   as will be the methods of dealing with it.Indeed, unless a comprehensive agreement is concluded at theearliest practicable date by the governments participating in the current discussions,  it may be anticipated thai: thewheat problem will become even more acute than it now is,that a most favourable opportunity will have been lost todeal effectively with this problem, which is of such greatimportance to all wheat-exporting and importing countries,and that the risk of serious consequences to some if not all of the countries concerned will be greatly magnified.It is of course in the interest of the wheat-exporting countries that European wheat-importing countries shouldlearn as soon as possible of the new policy which they willat the appropriate time be xoreased to adopt.      It is before,and not after, their urgent postwar needs have been relieved,that they should appreciate the necessity of international collaboration in working out an effective solution of theworld wheat problem.

Moreover,, the conclusion of a wheat agreement inaccordance with objectives indicated above will have animportant bearing on the solution of other problems of export surpluses. Such an agreement would&quot;not onlyencourage desires and efforts to conclude agreements inregard to other commodities presenting similar problemsbut will also help to establish the basic principles onwhich such agreements should he based.Furthermore,  the conclusion at this time of asatisfactory agreement regarding an important commoditysuch as wheat would be exceedingly significant from thepoint of view of the expressed intentions of the democracies,regarding postwar reconstruction.      It would forcefullyimpress upon all peoples the determination of the democ-racies to translate such intentions into practical measures and would help to dissipate doubts that may nowexist as to the possibilities of effective co-operation in the solution of international problems.Failure to conclude a wheat agreement would be exceedingly unfortunate,  not only from the point of viewof relieving the pressure of export surpluses of wheat and other commodities,, hut also from the point of view ofrelying on international collaboration for the provisionof immediate postwar relief or for any effective solutionof world problems.It is possible.,  of course, that any definitiveagreement which may be reached in regard to wheat as theresult of further discussions may differ in some important respects from that embodied in the provisional draft.My Government is now considering the draft with the viewto indicating any changes or revisions which may bedeemed desirable.      The other interested governments are likewise engaged.      Considerable differences of viewsbetween the various governments may develop and haveto be worked- out.      It is believed,  however, in view ofthe considerations set forth above,  that each governmentshould contribute to the utmost towards bringing thediscussions to a successful conclusion.I have,  etc.,(Signed)    JOHN G. 7/INANT.The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P.,etc. ,   etc. ,Foreign Office, S,W.l.
