This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the War Cabinet, April, 1941SECRETW.P. (G) (41) 42.2,3rd. April, tq^iWAR CABINETITALIAN CIVILIANS IN ETHIOPIAMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1, The British Military Authorities in East Africa are gravely concerned about the safety of some 40,000 Italian civilians, men, women and children, whowere concentrated in Addis Ababa by the Italian Authorities in the early stages of the campaign in Ethiopia. The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, has found it necessary to retain about 1,000 Italian police under arms in Addis Ababa forthe purpose of safeguarding these Italian civilians; but he reports that theItalians are very frightened and are liable to lose their heads in an emergency.This emergency is likely to arise when the Emperor makes his entry into addis ababa. The population retains, no doubt, a sufficiently vivid memory of theshambles produced by Graziani&apos;s troops at the Italian entry into the city in 1936.In the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief a situation is likely to develop, unlesssteps are taken to arrest it, in which, partly through well-founded nervousnesson the part of the Italian guards and partly through the enthusiasm of the local population, the example of the Italian conqueror is likely to be followed withmathematical fidelity by the Patriots, inflamed with success and by the presenceamong them of their Emperor. In such a case, while we would probably be unable effectively to prevent the massacre of the Italians, we would be likelyto find ourselves in the position, locally, of fighting side by side with the Italiansagainst the Abyssinians.2. It is imperative, therefore, on grounds alike of military necessity and ofpolitical convenience, to remove the Italian population from the seat of trouble.The problem appears to me to present itself in two stages: firstly, the immediateremoval of the Italian civilians from their present position of peril in addis ababa, to some other place in Ethiopia where their safety can be ensured; and secondly, their subsequent removal out of the former Italian territories by over-seas evacuation. The former problem is a matter for the local British MilitaryAuthorities, and they have been instructed to formulate immediate plans, possibly by the removal of the Italian civilians to Harrar (a town of Haile Selassie&apos;s owndomain, with a Mohammedan population less excited against the Italians).The latter problem has been the subject of approaches made by the Dominionsand Colonial Offices to General Smuts, and to the Governors of the British east african Colonies, with a view to finding accommodation for these Italians in east and South Africa.3. As a result of these enquiries, the Government of Kenya have expressed their willingness to take 2,000 Italians in existing accommodation, and more could probably be sent to the Colony if it proved necessary; Southern Rhodesiacan take -up to 5,000 if assistance is provided with the construction of thenecessary camps; but as regards South Africa, General Smuts expresses grave doubts about the wisdom of sending any large number of Italian civilians intothe Union. He states that they could only be housed in tents, and he fears theresult might soon be that we had on our hands a concentration camp problemreminiscent of the Boer War. His suggestion is that the United KingdomGovernment should approach the Italian Government, pointing out the danger to Italian women and children now concentrated in Addis Ababa,, the hardshipwhich will follow their concentration in internment camps in Africa, and suggest -ing that Italian ships, under a British safe-conduct, should be utilized for theevacuation of these Italian civilians from Ethiopia, and their repatriation toItaly. He adds that if the Italian Government reject such a proposal it wouldbe demonstrable to the world that the responsibility for the sufferings of theirown nationals was largely their own. ... -   c\Copy No.    D
4. The question is a very difficult one, and it is rendered more so by the factthat the avenue for evacuating the civilians is to Jibuti in French Somaliland.Until it is known whether the authorities of French Somaliland will join theFree French Movement, it is not practicable to count on the use of Jibuti for thispurpose, and the G.O.C. in East Africa is being asked to explore possible alternatives through ports in British Somaliland. The whole question has been examined by the Inter-Departmental Committee under the chairmanship ofthe Financial Secretary to the War Office, and their view, which I endorse, isthat an approach should be-made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the ItalianGovernment in the sense suggested by General Smuts. It might have to be acondition of any such offer that the shipping would be provided by the ItalianGovernment and, probably, that the voyage, under a safe-conduct from us,would be by the Cape. The practical difficulties in the proposal are, therefore,considerable and, it may well be, insurmountable. Nevertheless, I feel thatsuch an approach should be made. The Foreign Secretary is better able to judge than I of the propaganda value of such an offer if it were made, but Iwould think that even if it were rejected still more, indeed, if it were rejected the effect both in Italy and in the United States would be considerable. but apart from any immediate effect I am of the opinion that the fact that it hadbeen made would do a great deal to relieve His Majesty&apos;s Government of odiumin the event of a breakdown in the arrangements outlined in paragraphs 2and 3 above, and the consequent massacre of any part of the Italian population.5. I am not sanguine of the success of any such approach to the ItalianGovernment, and the Foreign Secretary may see objections to the proposal which will rule it out as a practical proposition; but as the proposal originateswith General Smuts and affords a possible solution to a very difficult andembarrassing problem, I would ask the War Cabinet to give it very early consideration.D.M.The War Office,23rd April, 1941.(b41/66)   no   4/41    WO.P.   7575
