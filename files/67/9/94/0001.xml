Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1941. -SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 94.September 11, 1941.WAR CABINET.SWEDISH OPINION ON THE WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs-.I THINK the attached report by Dr. Gie, the South African Minister in stockholm, about Swedish opinion on the war will be of interest to the WarCabinet.C.Dominions Office,September 11, 1941.WHILE the Swedish press in news headlines and military articles has fora considerable time been forecasting the imminent fall of Leningrad, it is note-worthy that one finds no revival of the expectation that Stalin&apos;s armies willdisintegrate and his regime collapse.Behind the above outlook on present developments in the Leningrad area, let me say in passing, is undoubtedly a good deal of wishful thinking. Swedes quitegenerally, and from their point of view very naturally, want the military opera-tions there to cease, because these may lead to their becoming embroiled in thewar, and thej^ prefer, it would appear, to be somewhat blind to facts and todiscount reports that go against their wishes, facts of continued successfulRussian resistance and counter-attacks and apparently welhfounded reportsthat the Finns have had enough of fighting and are averse to proceeding beyond their old boundary. I shall not venture to predict what course developments willtake up north, but disentangling themselves from the Germans will prove anexceedingly difficult undertaking for the Finns, and I shall not be at all surprisedif Leningrad holds out till winter inteiwenes.But to revert to the larger question of Russia, Swedish opinion, prejudicedas it very widely is against that country, now seems definitely to have accepted that the Russian war also will be long.The military correspondent of the leading local Conservative paper points outthat, even if the Germans succeed in reaching the border of the Caucasian oilregion, its conquest will be a more difficult and formidable task than anything yetattempted by them on land.The possibility of Moscow being taken seems to have sunk below the horizonin the present outlook here.Much attention is directed to the Southern sector, and it is regarded as likely that Turkey may soon become an important theatre of war, as Hitler cannot afford to leave untried all ways to new oil supplies.During the last few weeks one senses a stiffening of the Swedish attitudetowards Germany, also in Conservative and military circles, resulting mainly fromthe slow and costly German progress in Russia.The swift, successful Russo-British move in Iran has certainly likewise madea strong impression favourable to our side..; Here, as elsewhere, including Germany, only forceful, successful acts, clearlyrealised, to-day carry conviction and drive it home, and I must now, to my regret,proceed to say that when Swedes now look to the west they do not see enough ofsuch convincing activity.[22907J &apos; -
The Roosevelt-Churchill meeting certainly thrilled them, the film showing-it receiving so much applause on one occasion that audiences are now asked toshow their neutrality by remaining silent; but it was, I feel, mainly a dramaticthrill, and the effect will be of short duration if the meeting does not lead tovisible increased activity on the American side. Failing this, the further reactionmay even be a negative one for us.As for the Atlantic Declaration, fuller examination has shown that itsreception here has, on the whole, been unsatisfactory. Words, words, the Swedessay, and they further pretend that the promises are too vague and that Clause 8is too reminiscent of Versailles.Americans entry into the war is no longer regarded as certain and hardlydiscussed.Figures of American war production are too unexciting even to be madeuse of.Wordy American utterances are not impressive here, and doubts are enter-tained whether Roosevelt will be able to get his people to increase their help tothe extent required for an Allied victory.That our air superiority will be great enough next year to lay foundation forvictory is regarded as doubtful.It must also be admitted that the manner in which the extensive anddestructive British air raids over Germany are reported in the press and radionews-bulletins fails to make them impressive. It may be very difficult to make them so, but the unvarying accounts of the.bombing of &quot; industrial centres andother important objectives &quot; tend to become monotonous. This monotonyobscures the actual facts. I submit that new efforts should be made to let themstand out more clearly.I must add that people coming from Germany evidently see very little of theeffect of the bombing, probably because they are kept away from the bombedareas, but their testimony unfortunately confirms the idea current here that theBritish air offensive has not yet developed into a really serious menace for german economy and morale.We do, indeed, get many evidences of growing dissatisfaction in Germany,but it is ascribed to serious disappointment in regard to the Russian war, grave concern about what is being sacrificed for it and a wide feeling that nothing thathas been accomplished by German victories anywhere is bringing the final victory over England any nearer. &quot; Wir ubersiegen uns &quot; is being said in Germany.It might be translated : &quot; We are being beaten by our victories.&quot;To return to the Swedes, the following formula may be said to summarisetheir outlook : The Axis Powers to win the war must do so this year, and they cannot do it.The Allies to achieve victory must definitely be on top, at least in the air, nextyear, and it does not seem they will get there. If the decision is dela)red to 1943,stalemate leading to compromise appears likely.Behind this line of reasoning there is again some wishful thinking, the oldwish for a peace of compromise, but now more than before accompanied by feelings of very grave concern. It is felt that if the war is to drag on for years, Swedencan hardly hope to escape becoming involved, but that is no longer the mainconsideration in this regard. It is the wider and much more terrible prospectwhich a seemingly interminable war opens up for European humanity andcivilisation that appals thinking Swedes.I have tried to convey what is being thought in Sweden to-day. It may beof wider interest at this critical stage of the war.My own attitude is : that we can continue to envisage the future withunshaken confidence; that time will never operate against us relative to Germany;that Hitler&apos;s burdens and worries are growing apace; that he will add to them;that he has reached the borders of his unstable sphere of power, and that riftsinside it are already appearing; but I must confess to a feeling of keen and growing disappointment in regard to America, and the prospect of the wardragging on far into 1943 and possibly beyond it does give rise to concern.[This memorandum was written before the report of Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;slast speech. In the light of that speech, which I welcome as very opportune, thevalue of an account of what the Swedes are thinking may possibly be of somesignificance.]Stockholm, September 3, 1941.
