Printed for the War Cabinet.  May 1941.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 47.May 8, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SKILLED RADIO PERSONNEL.Second Progress Report by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.(Circulated for Information.)PROGRESS up to the end of April is reported below on the execution ofthe plans, approved by the War Cabinet on the 2nd January, 1941 (War Cabinet(41) 1, Minute 13), for obtaining skilled radio personnel for the Fighting Servicesand for the Industry (W.P. (G) (40) 327).2. The Report does not cover a new and unexpected demand received fromthe Air Ministry within the last few days for 8,000 additional radio mechanicsfrom home sources for the Royal Air Force. This demand is under active consideration.3. The organisation has been supplemented by an Inter-Departmental Sub-Committee (Chairman, Mr. Clement Jones of this office) to work out details. TheSub-Committee includes the Chairman of the Radio Manufacturers&apos; association and reports to me. A Report by the Sub-Committee on training arrangements is attached in Appendix I.4. The total number obtained or provided for in 1941 runs to five figures,but cannot be calculated exactly, as some of the returns overlap one another. (Fordetails, see Appendix II.) The total, however, has not much, significance apartfrom the main categories into which it is divided, viz. : Grade    I. Officers   for   the   Fighting   Services,   Research,   Industry,Educational Instruction fairly satisfactory.Grade   II. Radio Mechanics the main difficulty.Grade III. Operators no immediate problem.5. Grade I. The main source of supply is the 28 British Universities andUniversity Colleges, which have undertaken special courses in co-operation withthe Government.  For details, see the Clement Jones Report, paragraphs 4 to 12.The figures are as follows : Estimate in previous Report of numbers obtainable in1941     ............      .........      550Numbers accepted up to the end of March 1941        ...      704Available in April 1941      .........      53Available in June 1941      .........     340Available in September     ...      ...      ...     311704Original demand of Departments concerned ...       ...      870Deficit        .....................      166[22500] b
The numbers in sight exceed my original estimate by 154, but are 166 below thedemand. In the case of the Royal Air Force, there will be a lag of a month ortwo between the dates at which the men are required and the completion oftraining courses.6. The possible sources from which the Service Departments may be ableto fill any deficit are : The Services, by transfer of officers from other branches.Promotion of suitable men from Grade II.Dominions.United States of America.7. Grade II. The main source of supply of radio-mechanics is 61 technical colleges, which are giving ab initio training for the Army and the Royal AirForce as follows : Places occupiedby TraineesArmvRoyal Air ForceTotalNumberofTechnicalColleges.471461April 22,1941.1.5216842,205f Radio Mechanics-I    and ElectricalI   Fire Control.For details, see the Clement Jones Report, paragraphs 13 to 20. The coursesoccupy 16 weeks 3 in the year. The total yield, however, should exceed the 6,615men obtained by trebling the figure of 2,205, as the courses are not yet filled to capacity. The Royal Air Force, for example, on the 22nd April were only using8 of the 14 Colleges allotted to them, and plan to have 2,070 men (instead of thepresent 684) under ab initio training by August 1941.8. In the case of radio-mechanics, the organisation has worked under the disadvantage, until a few days ago, of having no estimate of the numbers requiredby the Ro3ral Air Force after the 30th June.9. The above figures, however, show that a good start has been made. I havevisited one of the Technical Colleges and found considerable enthusiasm amongstaff and students.10. The possible sources from which the Service Departments may be ableto fill any deficit in Grade II are : Services Training Establishments.Canada and other Dominions.*United States of America.Women.11. The Scheme for obtaining large numbers of radio-mechanics from canada and the United States of America became involved with a larger schemefor obtaining other skilled personnel and tradesmen from these sources. As theAir Ministry was the Department primarily concerned and much technical detailwas involved, the Secretary of State for Air kindly consented to take over this aspect of the question of radio personnel. The War Cabinet recently approved a plan for recruiting in the United States of America on a civilian basis. (WarCabinet 41 (41), Minute 7.)Wireless Training for Young People.12. In order to facilitate future requirements the Clement Jones Committee,in collaboration with the Board of Education, Ministry of Labour and the RadioManufacturers&apos; Association, have worked out a scheme for wireless training for young people of both sexes on leaving school. 70 Technical Colleges have been invited to co-operate. For details see the Clement Jones Report, paragraphs20 to 25.* Although the field in these countries is limited, some 600 radio mechanics may beexpected from New Zealand, and Australian resources are being examined.
13. Grade III. Wireless Operators are trained in Service Establishments,whose facilities suffice for present needs. In order to provide additional training facilities for the future, and as a reserve in case of damage to Service training establishments by enemy action, a scheme has been put in operation, with theapproval of the Treasury, for training wireless operators for the Services inprivately-owned wireless schools engaged in training operators for the merchant navy.14. Remarks. The progress made with the scheme is satisfactory, butpending examination I cannot yet say how far it can be expanded to meet theAir Ministry&apos;s new requirement of 8,000 radio mechanics before the 31st March,1942, as well as an additional demand by the War Office of which I have beengiven warning.HANKEY.55 Whitehall, S.W. 1,May 8. 1941.
Wireless Personnel Joint Sub-Committee (Radio Industry and Services).Interim Report.To the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.1.   WE were appointed by you in January last with the following Termsof Reference : (a) To advise as to what skilled and semi-skilled wireless personnel can bemade available for the Lighting Services from Industry.(b) To devise and inaugurate wireless training schemes for Service personnelat civilian training centres.(c) To co-ordinate the demands ma.de by the Services upon training facilities,instructional equipment and instructors, and to make recommendations as to the syllabus and curriculum for training courses.(d) To assist the Fighting Services in the tracing of misplaced wirelesspersonnel which has already been enlisted, and in ensuring that skilledwireless personnel about to be enlisted is not misplaced.(e) To advise on any other questions referred by Lord Hankey.2. Since the Committee was constituted we have held fortnightly meetings on alternate Tuesdays. The three main problems with which we have been concerned are those indicated in the first three clauses of our terms of reference,namely : -(a) The supply of wireless personnel.(b) The organisation of training schemes at technical colleges.(c) The provision of equipment and instructors for the training centres.3. We have considered it essential in the national interest that the problemof supply of skilled wireless personnel (a) for the Services and (b) for Industry inthe production of equipment for the Services, should be. dealt with as a singleproblem, the allocation of such personnel to the Forces and to Industry to have its derivation from a common pool.4. Further, we have recognised the necessity for proper co-ordination oftraining schemes for wireless personnel in the Services or in Industry to preventoverlap and duplication of effort.Wireless Personnel: Supply and Training.5. Taking seriatim the three subjects detailed in paragraph 2, we deal first with the question of wireless personnel.The supply can be divided roughly into two classes : (a) Those coming from the Universities.(6) Those from other sources.6. In the case of University men, we have had the benefit of advice fromDr. C. P. Snow (Ministry of Labour Central Register), who, after visiting the universities, has attended several of our meetings.7. Whilst the first target aimed at was a total of some 500 University menannually, it now appears over 700 men will come from this source during 1941.8.   The steps taken to secure this have been (a) Third-year University courses for physicists and electrical engineers havebeen given a definite radio bias to the extent of about one-third of thetotal working time.Graduates from these courses will number approximately : 60 in April.240 in June.60 in December.
* Not attached.(6) Other third-year science students, with physics and radio aptitude, suchas mathematicians, physical chemists, biologists, &amp;c, will be given an intensive summer course (about 8 weeks) in radio engineering. Thiswill bring these men approximately to the radio level of the physicistsand electrical engineers referred to in Group (a) above. These courseswill yield some 340 men during September.9. The men graduating from these two courses will provide excellent rawmaterial for high-grade radio technicians in the Services and in Industry.10. The requirements of the Services, Government Departments andIndustry for this type of man during 1941 have been ascertained; they are statedto be approximately as follows  (a) Navy:  50.(6) Army:  200.(c) R.A.F. : 340 needed as to 170 in May and 170 in August to keep their training schools filled.  This is a minimum figure.(d) Board of Education (as instructors) : 50.(e) Government Experimental Establishments : 100/150.(/) Radio Industry :   100.11. All the men in the Pool of University graduates have been or will bepersonally interviewed by Dr. Snow, and their qualifications are fully known.They will be allocated to the Services or to Industry in accordance with theneeds of each, and regard will be paid to the qualifications of the individual fora particular form of service.12. Allocation arrangements will be made as early as possible, so as to ensurethat each man is used in the capacity for which he is most suited, and that eachshall know well in advance the duty to which he will be called on completinghis University course.13. Whilst the highest grade wireless personnel is derived from the universities, from Industry and from certain Technical Colleges, there is a largerequirement of men of a lower grade, both in the Services and in Industry. Thesewe propose to train in Technical Colleges.14. At the start of our inquiry it was ascertained that men of this typewould be needed during 1941, in approximately the following numbers : Navy: 300.Army : 3,000.R.A.F. : 1,500 (up to the 30th June).Industry : 1,000 (for production of service equipment).15. To provide the necessary basic wireless training for this class of man.db initio wireless courses have been started in Technical Colleges throughout thecountry. A list of the Colleges at which these courses are in operation is attached(Annexe 1).*16. The curriculum for these courses has been drawn up in collaborationby the Services concerned, the Board of Education, and the Radio Manufacturers&apos;Association. It covers a period of 16&apos; weeks, 42 hours per week, and on completionof this ab in-initio course, the trainee is qualified for employment in a skilled wirelesscapacity, either in the Fighting Services or in Industry. In either case some further short intensive training will be needed to fit the man for the particularduty to which he goes. This further training will be provided by the Service orthe factory concerned.17. Up to the 22nd April trainees have been placed in these special wirelesscourses in technical colleges in approximately the following numbers :  Army : 1,600 trainees.R.A.F. : 700 trainees (see Annexe 2* for future programme).18. No trainees for industry have yet been placed in these courses. But ithas been ascertained there is a present requirement of nearly 600 wirelesspersonnel in the industry in connection with the production of wireless equipment for the Services.
19. The detailed requirements of the manufacturers have only recently beenmade known to the Ministry of Labour in order that suitable personnel may besupplied to meet them; or, if an insufficient number is available, suitable materialmust be put into training for this purpose in the courses in the Technical Colleges.The source from which these requirements will be met is, in general, men recentlyde-reserved in the light electrical engineering trades, or men above the reservedages in these trades who are not now engaged on vital work.20. After visiting one of these Technical Colleges and seeing both thetrainees and the system of training, it will be appreciated how important it isthat the radio courses at these Colleges should always be kept at concert pitch.This can only be done by maintaining the proper supply of instructors andequipment.Wireless Training for Young People.21. Apart from the immediate needs, we have considered it essential toprovide a continuous supply of men with wireless knowledge, both for the Servicesand for Industry, to meet future requirements as they recur.22. To that end, in collaboration with the Board of Education, Ministry ofLabour and the Radio Manufacturers&apos; Association, we have worked out a schemefor the provision of wireless training for young people (both boys and girls) on leaving school.23.   The essential features of this scheme are :- (a) Type of young person to be trained. Wireless training will be afforded to young persons of a standard equivalent to school-leaving certificatein mathematics and physics; on the basis that some 1,250 youngpersons will be needed annually.(b) Type of training. Such young persons will be given special intensivecourses similar to those arranged for Service personnel at technical colleges.(c) Subsistence allowance. College fees and an appropriate subsistence allowance will be paid by the Ministry of Labour to young studentsduring their period of training in the Technical Colleges.(d) Ages of admission. The ages of admission to the courses to be : Women : No age restriction.Men : Up to 17 years 3 months, in order to permit at least6 months&apos;- factory experience at the conclusion of theTechnical College course, before calling up for MilitaryService.(e) Control after training. It will be a condition of admission to trainingthat on completion of the College course the trainee will proceed tothe Wireless Industry or act in accordance with the directions of theMinistry of Labour.(f) Geographical  Collation  of  requirements. The  requirements  of  theIndustry will be collated geographically by collaboration of the Boardof Education and the Radio Manufacturers&apos; Association, in order toensure that young people are employed in factories reasonably close to their residence. Whenever possible, students in a particular collegeto be linked with a factory or group of factories.(g) Attraction of suitable young persons. It should be understood thatyoung persons taking the proposed training courses will enter theIndustry as members of the Technical Staffs of the firms concerned;and that, at the conclusion of the war, consideration should be givento the possibility of providing further training for those desiring toobtain it. The assistance of headmasters will be sought in attractingyoung persons of the right type to enter the course.(h) Special Note. Particular attention is directed to (1) The desirability of affording wireless training under this schemeto a considerable number of young women, which it is under-stood the Industry is prepared to employ wherever possible.It is suggested that some 250 women should be trained annually,in addition to 1.000 youths.
(2) That youths trained under the scheme, on reaching military agershould in general be regarded as available for service with trieFighting Forces in a wireless capacity.24. The provision of this training for young people on leaving school will serve a dual purpose. Youths so trained will be of use in the Industry in theproduction of Service equipment until they reach military age. When called up,tlhey will enter the Services with a satisfactory basic wireless training whichwill enable them to be employed in the Services in a wireless capacity with aminimum of delay.25. In making these arrangements for the training of young people teprovide a regular intake of skilled wireless personnel, we have been breakingfresh ground, and from this virgin soil we hope, by careful cultivation, to produceannual crops of good quality.Equipment.26.   The inauguration of the wireless courses at the Technical Colleges has, necessitated the supply of suitable equipment for use in the classes and instructorsto conduct them.27. A grant of  20,000 was authorised by the Treasury on the 10th Februaryfor the purchase of the essential equipment.28. The specification of this equipment was drawn up by the Board ofEducation and agreed with the Services.  It is detailed in Annexe 3.*29. The Radio Manufacturers&apos; Association was requested to act as a centralmedium for the placing of orders and the giving of delivery instructions, paymentbeing made by the Air Ministry.30. The Director of Contracts, Ministry of Aircraft Production, author-rised the R.M.A. to proceed with this matter on the 12th March. Orders were immediately placed with the firms from which the equipment was desired. Themore urgent delivery instructions were given by telephone on the 13th March, and confirmed by letter delivered by hand on the 14th March. Delivery instructions for the remainder of the equipment were issued on the 17th March.31. In an endeavour to secure delivery with the utmost expedition, contactwas established with appropriate officials at the Ministry of Supply and Ministryof Aircraft Production. There is an urgent demand by the Services for thevery equipment needed in these courses, and the present position is that the ministries concerned have given instructions that production shall be divided between the Colleges and the Services and deliveries made to each as the equipment becomes available.32.   Deliveries of equipment have been promised as indicated in Annexe 4.*Instructors.33. To assist in the provision of suitable instructors, refresher courses of aweek&apos;s duration have been arranged with the co-operation of the R.A.F. atCranwell and some 60 wireless instructors from the Technical Colleges have beenput through these courses.34. A question was raised with us by the Board of Education as to whetheraliens might be employed as instructors in the wireless courses in the technical colleges. Having in mind the possibly bad psychological effect, and the fact thatthe teachers might obtain information through their necessarily close contact with the trainees members of the Fighting Services we agreed to recom-mend:  (a) That enemy aliens be not employed as teachers in the special wirelesscourses in Technical Colleges, but that such men be employed in otherTechnical Colleges to release, so far as possible, other instructors ofBritish nationality for employment in the special courses.(&amp;) That friendly aliens with suitable qualifications be employed as teachers in the special wireless courses.* Not attached.
Misplaced Wireless Personnel.35. In addition to these main problems, we have endeavoured, under term (d)of reference, to attempt to trace misplaced wireless personnel which has already-been enlisted. To this end we have been in communication with the vice--Chancellors of Universities and other similar organisations, throughDr. C. P. Snow. In conjunction with the Radio Manufacturers&apos; Association, a census has been taken of wireless service engineers previously employed in theIndustry and now serving with the Forces. The Wireless Telegraphy Board hasalso been of assistance in tracing misplaced personnel already in the Services. Inaddition, numbers of wireless personnel have been found by the Services&apos; owncomb-outs.36.   As a result, wireless men have been traced who were employed in theServices in other than a wireless capacity, approximately as follows : University men ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 100Wireless Service Engineers    ...      ...      ...      ...      3,50037. Arrangements have been...made with certain specific exceptions totransfer these men to. duties in which use is made of their wireless knowledge, orto give them further wireless training in Technical Colleges or in Service training courses to fit them for service in a wireless capacity.38. These men have, in fact, been one source of supply of trainees placed upto the present in the special courses in the Technical Colleges.39. With the aim of remedying the misplacement of men with wirelessknowledge, and preventing its continuance in future, we have from time to timesubmitted to you various recommendations, as follows :  (a) That no men with wireless qualifications or with qualifications whichwould enable them to be trained as wireless men may be recruited toany branch of the Services until their suitability for employment aswireless officers or mechanics has been investigated.(&amp;) Further, that in view of the urgency of the present situation, all skilledwireless men now serving with the Forces, either as officers or men, bemade available for posting to appointments where their wirelessknowledge may be utilised to the best advantage.(c) That students in Universities taking courses including radio engineeringbe not recruited until they have completed, their course.(d) That such students already in the Services who cannot be employed in aradio capacity be returned to the Universities to complete their course.40. Your acceptance of recommendations (a) and (6) enabled the misplacedmen referred to in paragraph 35 to be &quot; combed &quot; and more fittingly employed;and the carrying out of recommendations (c) and (d) will increase the number of trained wireless engineers available for future use.Training of Wireless Operators.41. Among the questions referred by you to us under term (e), we have dealtwith a memorandum dated the 6th February, 1941, by Lieut.-Colonel Lycett,Chairman, Wireless Telegraphy Board, on the training of wireless operators forthe Fighting Services in privately-owned wireless schools.42. We were advised that, at present, the facilities of these privately-ownedwireless schools were largely engaged in training wireless operators for theMerchant Navy. Some 1,400 men now in training will complete their course in about 6 months&apos; time.43. The Services representatives on our Committee, whilst stating that atpresent they had facilities for training their own wireless operators, considered it essential that the privately-owned wireless schools should be maintained forprobable future use.44. We, therefore, recommend to you that the proposals put forward inLieut.-Colonel Lycett&apos;s memorandum should be approved, and put into operationwith all possible speed.  We are informed that this scheme is now in operation
General.45. While some of the questions referred to above have been settled, it isclear that many more will keep springing up in connection with the three main problems of personnel, training and equipment, because the demands for trained men are ever increasing, the training is in a constant state of expansion, and thestream of equipment, as we have found, is only too apt either to dry up or to be diverted to channels outside our province.Within the last few days, and since the above Report was drafted, we havebeen notified that the estimated requirements of the R.A.F. for wireless personnel,for the period ending the 31st December, 1941, have been vastly increased. TheCommittee will consider means of satisfying these requirements and submit afurther report to you in due course.(Signed) CLEMENT JONES, Chairman.April 22, 1941.APPENDIX II.Skilled Radio Personnel.Sources of Supply suggested in W.P.
