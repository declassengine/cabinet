This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the War Cabinet, April, 1941SECRETCopy No.W.P. (G) (41) 412,2nd April, 1941WAR CABINETUSE OF MILITARY PERSONNEL FOR NON-MILITARYPURPOSESMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI circulate a memorandum which has been prepared in the War Office aboutthe employment of soldiers upon non-military duties.I do not wish for one moment to suggest that the Army ought not to lenda hand to the civil departments at a time when enemy air attack is about to reachits climax. On the other hand, it is my duty also to guarantee, so far as possible,that if and when an enemy invasion of this country takes place, or raids upona large scale are undertaken, the forces at our disposal for repelling the attackare tactically trained and disposed to the best advantage, and administrativelyare adequately maintained. I must oppose any development of policy whichis contrary to this principle, or which has the effect of reducing, without good reason, the numbers and the quality of the troops immediately available to stand between the public and invasion. The memorandum explains a numberof developments which affect the availability of the Home Defence formations.It also refers by implication to the fact that in these days of mechanization theArmy, equally with industry, demands its quota of men of high quality, andthat the civil departments would do well to remember that by combing theArmy of its better men they are reducing the efficiency upon which the safety of industry depends in the last resort.I ask the War Cabinet to agree, as a matter of urgency, that the proposals contained in the memorandum shall be examined by a Minister not directly concerned with any of the subjects covered by it, in collaboration with mydepartment and the other departments which are concerned, in order that final decisions may be taken or, if necessary, a recommendation be made to theWar Cabinet. The solution may lie in relieving the Army of these non-militaryduties (as I should hope) or in entrusting the Army with their performance, orin a combination of both, but I wish to make it clear that in the latter cases the overall numbers of the Army, as approved by the Minister of Defence, must beincreased pro tanto if the security of the country is to be assured.D. M.The War Office,22nd April, 1941.1. The Prime Ministers directive of the 6th March, 1941, laid down the numerical size at which the Army is to be maintained.2. After allowing for overseas commitments and for the static defences ofthis country there is left a residue of military man-power from which must befashioned the Home Defence Army.The organization of this residue into infantry divisions and armouredformations has been approved by the Minister of Defence, and it is upon thisagreed basis that the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, establishes hispreparations for meeting invasion.
23. Not all the Home Defence troops are completely equipped and trained.Moreover, even when they are reasonably equipped and trained a factor vital to success is the correct strategical disposition of the troops.4. Intensive training is a matter of the most urgent importance. the complications of modern war are such that both the individual soldier and the unit require prolonged periods of training before they can be regarded as fullyefficient. Continuous further training is required to maintain this efficiency.The forces of the enemy have had this prolonged period of training followedby experience on the battlefields of Poland and France, and may reasonably be classified as first-class. Our forces, with few exceptions, have not had theseopportunities, and if they are to be a match for those of the enemy training-must be intensive, continuous and uninterrupted. The attitude of mind whichassumes that invasion is deferred and that training therefore ceases to be important for the moment has no meaning from the military point of view. Wecannot pit second-class troops against a first-class enemy.The Maginot Line mentality can be as disastrous here is it was in Franceand with less excuse.5. It follows that the diversion of troops from their training or theirstrategical areas is contrary to the requirements of national safety, whether onthe long or the short view. But demands for such diversion increase from day to day, and it is the object of this paper to discuss the merits of the demands and to propose a codification upon which their future acceptance or rejectionmay be based.6. Assistance to Bombed Cities. A city which has been severely attackedfrom the air cannot be expected to meet the immediate crisis solely from within its own resources. Moreover, there is advantage in the rapid appearance ofuniformed troops to sustain morale. The Army has rapiclly come to the assist-ance of Coventry and other cities, and it is accepted that it must continue todo so, even at some cost to its military preparedness.Technical R.E. units have been made available for this purpose, and to alimited extent the work which they perform is in tune with their technicalmilitary training. But the Army is not provided with R.E. units in excess ofits requirements: thus the diversion of technical R.E. units to this kind of work has the effect of retarding progress on defence and accommodation projects which are vital to the needs of the Army itself.Non-technical troops have also been used in considerable numbers. Thetraining of these troops suffers a set-back which is not measurable merely interms of the time spent in the area. It is of great importance that the stay ofthese latter troops, unavoidably damaging to their morale as troops, should bedrastically curtailed.It is proposed, therefore, that while non-technical troops shall be madeavailable where physically possible for a &quot; blitzed&quot; area, Regional Commis-sioners shall be warned that they will in all cases be withdrawn 72 hours after their arrival, civil measures to be instituted before the end of that period. Incases of exceptional need technical units may be spared for longer periods.The clearance of debris, except in so far as its presence may impede com-munications, is not a matter i&amp;hich should engage military personnel.7. Fire Watching.- It is accepted that the safety of the Western Portstakes priority, on the wide view, over invasion possibilities and that troops mustbe made available for this purpose until civil arrangements are completed. Butthis duty involves not merely an interruption of military training and a deterioration of morale, but in some cases (Glasgow) the movement of forma-tions from their strategical areas of concentration, to the grave prejudice of anti-invasion preparedness. There is no certainty that invasion, or enemy raids,will not take place to-morrow.At 1st April, 1941, over 8,000 all ranks were employed on this duty. Moreare demanded.It is therefore proposed that civil arrangements for all ports affected shallbe completed within one month, the existing powers of compulsion being used
* Defence works, construction of docks and army camps, labour work at ordnance ammunition and supply depots, etc.if necessary. The order of urgency can be discussed with the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces. It is not clear why docks should be excused a dutyaccepted by all other branches of industry. Civil organizations are alreadywithdrawing men fire watchers because the Army has made soldiers available.8. Agricultural Workers. The War Office has already lent to theMinistry of Agriculture 3,000 men of the Pioneer Corps for agricultural work,and is now asked to produce a further 8,000. 1,000 men with agriculturalexperience have been given special leave. If 3,000 Italian prisoners of war donot reach this country the demand on the Army will increase.The Pioneer Corps was raised for military purposes* and the military workwhich remains to be done would more than fully occupy the time of the wholeof the Pioneer Corps. Already vital defence works in this country and in iceland are delayed in their completion by the lack of sufficient Pioneers, andit would be out of the question further to diminish their numbers by accedingto the Ministry&apos;s request. It follows, therefore, that if the Army is to undertake this duty it must have authority to take in additional numbers over and abovethe numbers authorized by the Minister of Defence.Agricultural work has rather less to do with the Army than any of theother non-military matters referred to in this memorandum. It is not even a dangerous occupation. The argument that the men must be under disciplinebecause they must be moved from place to place is not a good argument for placing them under military discipline, and if the powers of compulsion whichthe Government have acquired cannot be used for this purpose it is not easy tosee why they were acquired. Any disciplinary control necessary for suchworkers could be instituted without recourse to military law, but the Army, if required, could readily find unfit retired Army officers to take charge of thegangs if that were necessary. The accommodation, feeding (and discipline) ofsuch gangs of men would merely tend to lengthen the administrative servicesof the Army at the expense of its fighting personnel.It is accordingly proposed that agricultural workers shoidd be raised undercivil auspices and that the 3,000 Pioneers at present employed on this work should be quickly relieved.It is also suggested that the burial of diseased cattle and the porterage offish are duties of a non-military character which shoidd be undertaken by thecivil authorities.9. Harvesting and Hop-picking. The Army will continue to help inseasonal and local activities of this kind, subject to the overriding demands ofthe military situation.10. Railways. Although certain units of R.E. are employed on civil rail-ways the work is valuable training and the practice can be continued subjectto the prior demands of military requirements.11. Smoke-raising Units. The Army is required to find 20,000 all ranksfor smoke-raising units. This number of men was included in the figuresapproved by the Minister of Defence as the over-all strength of the Army. Itis a matter of doubt whether this duty is not more properly a civil duty, but,as the numbers have been, or will be, provided, it may be thought desirablenot to alter the present arrangement under which the Army administers this service.If, however, the numbers required materially exceed 20,000 all ranks, theMinistry of Labour should be instructed to find the additional numbers outsidethe over-all figures for the Army which, tinder the Minister of Defence&apos;s directive,they are at present required to find.12. Individual Releases. There is another and more insidious drain uponArmy man-power. Hundreds of applications are received a week for therelease of individual soldiers, not merely on grounds of personal hardship but because their presence is said to be essential for this or that purpose connectedwith the national effort.   Units have suffered throughout the war from this
process of individual releases. There was a large comb-out immediately afterthe outbreak of war of men in reserved occupations. Altogether the Army hasreleased indefinitely 43,600 men, while temporary releases amount to over 10,000.There are in addition transfers to the R.A.F. as flying personnel. At the urgentrequest of the Air Ministry up to 800 officers and 20,000 other ranks are beingmade available for flying crews this year. This is also a method of usingtalents in the best way, but at the expense of the Army. A unit is alwayssubject to loss through sickness, a loss which cannot be avoided, but theadditional loss of individual men, who, because they are of value in civil lifeare likely equally to be of particular value in the Army, cannot be accepted any longer. The recommendations of the civil departments for individual releaseswill, therefore, be dealt with more critically in future and will only be accepted in the face of overwhelming arguments. Applications for temporary blockreleases by civil departments will, if necessary, be submitted for the adjudicationof .an independent member of the administration.(b41/66)   110   4/41   w.O.P.   7571
