SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 43.May 2, 1941.WAR CABINET.REPORT BY UNITED KINGDOM HIGH COMMISSIONER IN CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I THINK that Members of the War Cabinet will be interested to read the enclosed account of Mr. Mackenzie King by Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, the HighCommissioner in Ottawa.&apos;   C.May 2, 1941.I HAVE had three long private talks over the luncheon and dinner tablewith Mr. Mackenzie King since I arrived. Some of the conversation has consisted of a mutual exchange of anecdotes, personal reminiscences and philosophiccomments on politics and politicians which had better not be put &quot; on the record/&apos;But it has illustrated a shrewd and humorous outlook on men and affairs whichis an attractive part of the Prime Ministers character, and one of the weapons in his armoury which has enabled him to survive with good health and excellenttemper a long life of political vicissitudes.With regard to public affairs, what has impressed me most, perhaps because it surprised me a little, is the firmness and even enthusiasm with wdiich he speaksof continuing the war to the very end. The most striking occasion on which hedemonstrated this mood was at a private dinner given by the Government toGeneral Sikorski and myself, when in a short after-dinner speech he declaredbefore his Ministerial colleagues and the heads of the Canadian Services, as wellas before the Polish visitors, the members of the miniature Diplomatic Corps andthe Dominion High Commissioners, that Canada would remain as a comrade in arms at Poland&apos;s side until the Polish people had regained their freedom. he spoke with such warmth and strength that General Sikorski, on hearing awhispered translation of the speech, leapt to his feet and with great emotionthanked the Prime Minister and called upon the company to drink his health.The fact is that Mr. Mackenzie King is profoundly stirred by the issues which are at stake in the war. His political convictions are sincere and deep,and he feels that Hitler and his gangsters threaten everything in which he, asa Liberal, believes. Over and over again in conversation I have felt that his mind is set on fighting the war without any compromise, however long it maylast, and that this is no new-found intention, but one which must have animatedhim from the very hour of Britain&apos;s declaration of war.He is therefore eager that Canada should shoulder fully her share of theburden which must fall upon the band of brother-nations in this gigantic andgruelling enterprise. He is not endowed with the qualities of a war leader : thereis in him no great dynamic energy, no genius for military affairs or statecraftof the highest order, no gift of stirring oratory. He is somewhat pedestrian.But though eager spirits in the Dominion are conscious of this, they all recognisethat he knows better than anyone else in the country how to keep the various[22475]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1941.
elements in this nation united.   He is a supremely skilful, as well as patriotic,,politician; and is now, and may be for a long time to come, the only possibleparty leader in the only possible party in a country still ruled by partygovernment. , -. There is no question about his determination that Canada shall contributeall that she can towards victory. This has been notably shown recently by his speech in Parliament assuring the British Government that the Canadian people would continue to find the dollars necessary for all the United KingdomVpurchases of munitions, &amp;c, in this country as well as for Canada&apos;s own enormousorders. The gesture is magnificent. Whether or not he and his colleagues, orthe taxpayers, realise fully the sacrifices and strain which it will place upon this young nation may be open to question; but there is no sign in Governmentcircles that they will shirk in any way whatever proves necessary. We shallsee more clearly how they intend to tackle the problem when the Finance Ministerbrings his budget down to the House after the Easter recess.There may be much to criticise in the Canadian Government&apos;s slowness inthe early part of the war in coming to grips with the tasks involved; and thereis still lacking here the urge which would come from the bombing of Ottawa,Montreal and a few other Canadian cities. But there is a growing consciousnessthat these grim experiences will only be denied to them if victory is denied toHitler in Britain. Such reflections have stirred Mr. Mackenzie King and hiscolleagues into much greater energy. A deep natural affection for the OldCountry for its own sake, and a proud admiration for the resistance of the peopleof Britain, are also, of course, sharp spurs to action.Another factor is now making Mr. Mackenzie King change the attitude ofcaution&quot; amounting to timidity and reticence amounting to dumbness which hassometimes characterised him. The efforts of the United States as an arsenal of democracy are receiving immense publicity, and seem to be completely eclipsingthe valuable efforts of Canada in the sight of the overseas public. This tendencyseems to be encouraged in Washington itself, where Canada&apos;s war effort is, I gather, being spoken of in terms of sarcasm which can Only be compared with thesarcasm which I have heard used by our sailors who have to go to sea in the fiftydestroyers which the United States presented to Britain. This sneering is veryunjust to Canada, for such contributions as the Empire Air Training Scheme andthe provision of dollars by Canada, not to mention the sacrifice of many youngCanadian lives, are very great. Incidentally, it would be very helpful if oratorsill Britain who readily praise the aid that is to come to us from the United states would at the same time remember to mention that this grand young north american neighbour of the United States, which is blood of our blood and fleshof our flesh, is giving aid which, in relation to the size and wealth of her popula-tion, is at least as great. But, of course, Mr. Mackenzie King is himself primarily to biame for the world&apos;s imperfect knowledge of Canada&apos;s effort. Until recentlythere has been no serious attempt by the Ottawa Government to make its extentknown, and the Prime Minister in person has constantly frowned upon anything in the nature of &quot; propaganda.&quot; He is modifying his attitude to this question.He is alarmed at the impression being created in so many quarters that theUnited States is the only workshop in this all-important North American arsenalof democracy. He is unleashing the dogs of propaganda, and intends himself to lead the pack. One of the proposals that he wishes to make to the President whenhe meets him this week at Warm Springs is that he (the Prime Minister) should come to the United States and make a speech about CanadVs war effort.He has spoken much in our talks of his intimate conversations with thePresident. There is no doubt that these two get on very weli together, and thatMr. Roosevelt confides a great deal to his fellow-alumnus of Harvard when theymeet. Not only their chats together at the fireside in the Presidents home, butalso their telephone conversations in the hearing of subordinates, appear to be conducted without any conventional official restraints or any respect for individual persons. (Months before the late American Ambassador&apos;s with-drawal from the Court of St. James the President used to refer to him Over the telephone as &quot; that damned fellow Kennedy.&quot;) Always Mr. Roosevelt has told mr.. King very frankly of his private intentions in public affairs, such as, fromthe very beginning, his plans to do everything in his power to help Britain to defeat Germany, and, long before the Democratic Party Convention, his rjesolvetd stand for a third term as President.   He has sought the Prime Ministers
advice oh some of his own Washington problems, and sometimes acted on his suggestions as to solutions. No doubt all these conversations are on record in&apos;some appropriate place, and I need not repeat their gist here.The pleasant relationship which exists between these two statesmen&quot;buddies &quot; is illustrated by the story, which Mr. Mackenzie King told me witha merry twinkle in his eyes, of the beginning of their talks a year or more ago onNorth American defence. There is a large swimming pool at the Presidentshouse1 in Warm Springs, in which Mr. Roosevelt spends much time, for thebuoyancy of the water seems to give a little life to his paralyzed limbs. The twofriends were both up to the neck in the pool one day when Mr. Rooseveltremarked : &quot; Mackenzie, what are you and I going to do about the defence ofthe North American Continent 1&apos;&apos; The conversation then continued for two hourswhilst the President and Prime Minister (&quot; both of us,&quot; explained the latter tome, &quot; stark naked except for little belly bands &quot;) basked in the sunny waters,and by the time that they had finished their bath they had also laid the foundations of the United States-Canadian Agreement for military co-operation in the defence of this end of their Continent.This friendship is not only charming but fruitful, and can be of much value to us. There may be some clanger that Mr. Mackenzie King will be inclined to associate Canada too closely as a North American country with the United states as distinct from the United Kingdom. But I doubt whether he will really pushthis process further than is in any case inevitable. He has expressed to me morethan once his relief that there is nobody of opinion in the Dominion in favourof joining the United States. Loyalty to the British Commonwealth is, I believe,paramount in his mind as it is in the minds of his fellow-countrymen.This week he is going on another visit to the President, when he hopes to hear revelations of Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s intentions about United States participation in the war.   I have ventured to wish him good bathing.
