byAn Army OfficerFriday,    30th May 1941.     9 Pom.    NEWS (HOME SERVICE)When my Naval friend - his name&apos;s Tiny by the way, and I hope he&apos;slistening - invited me aboard his ship, he warned me that it might be dull.It was not dull.     I joined the ship last week in her port and spent thefirst day visiting other ships or - light refreshment - and came to theconclusion that life in the Navy was a very pleasant affair;    especially as I was given the Captain&apos;s cabin as soon as we went to sea.The following day we set off on convoy work and I had time to look theship over - a grand ship.We knew that the BISIiARCK was out, of course, but nothing exciting,happened until one day, when I was on the bridge, with the Captain.The bridge of a ship has all sorts of communications and ways of sendingand receiving messages, put the really exciting one is the loud Pip, Pip,from the signal room, which means a message from, say, the C-in-C --Commander-in-Chief,We were all standing about talking about nothing in particular, whensuddenly this loud Pip, Pip, went.     The message was handed tp the Captainand as soon as he saw it, he said:    &apos;Boys, we1re on the BISMARCKJ1     Orderswent out, left, right and centre, and the excitement amongst complete order was terrific.     We felt that at last we were on the track of somethingreally good.     The course was altered and from that time on, whenever thePip, Pip went, everybody jumped to it.We got constant signals from other ships in the Atlantic, andintercepted signals, giving the position, course and speed of the BISMARCK.These were immediately plotted on the chart, so that we could compare theBISMARCK&apos;s position with our own and see what chance we had of meeting her.Then came a moment of terrible depression, when the news came throughthat the NORFOLK, which had been shadowing her for so long, had lost touch.The whole atmosphere went flat.     This gloom continued for a long time,until suddenly the news came through that the BISIIARCK had been sighted byCatalina aircraft.     As soon as we heard this, everybody rushed to thechartroom - at least I did - and it seemed pretty clear that we were betweenthe BISMARCK and Brest, for which port she was making.We followed on our course until Tuesday morning - we were all up allnight, of course - before it was light, and we got to the rendezvous.     Halfand hour after that the battle between the big ships began, and for morethan two hours, I gazed at something quite phenomenal which I was very, verylucky to see.     We were watching the battle from quite close to the NORFOLK,who was cruising up and down, letting off a terrific zoomph of a broadsideevery few minutes.As soon as the K.G.5 on the RODNEY had got the range, hits could beseen through glasses on various parts of the BISMARCK.     She returned the fire for about an hour to an hour and a half;    the fire got more and morespasmodic,  she started off with broadsides, then there were guns firing one by one, but what finally seemed to put her out of action was the RODNEY.The officer on the bridge next to me suddenly said:    !Great Scott.    she&apos;s/going
going to ran the BISMARCK. 1     But the RODNEY must have closed in to - Iwas told five thousand yards, and let off everything she&apos;d got.     Therewere terrific flashes of flame which must have been the BISLlARCK&apos;smagazines, and finally she stopped returning the fire altogether.     the k.G. 5 and the RODNEY still continued for about an hour afterwards to pumpstuff into her, and about half past ten they seemed satisfied and sailedoff.     We sailed away, too, before the final coup de grace vms given by theDORSETSHIRE.When v/e finally reached port I was talking to an officer from the ship which had been detailed to i^ick up survivors, and he made a statement whichI think is interesting;    to the effect that the Germans of Ypres were agrand lot of chaps, and that one of them, who spoke very good English andhad been five years in America, had said to this particular officer:    &quot;I want you to understand that we&apos;re not a lot of arrogant Nazis, but areGermans fighting for our Mother Country&quot;.In spite of these rather hazardous experiences, I had a cracking goodleave amongst the very best lot of blokes you could find anywhere.HR(Transcribed from Telediphone Recording)
