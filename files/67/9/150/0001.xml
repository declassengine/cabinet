(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )SEC RET.-    WAR: CABINET,HOME POLICY COMMITTEE.&apos;&apos;Memorandum by tile Secretary of State for War,1. In his speech in the House of.Commons on 2nd. December (see Hansard,column 10L3) the prime Minister said&quot;Power must now be taken by Statute to direct men into the home guard in areas where it is necessary and to require them to attend- the drills and musters indispensable to the maintenance of -efficiency.      Liability: for service in the Home Guard will be defined by Regulation,     We do not propose to exercise this poweruntil that Regulation has been subject to a special discussion in the House of Commons, apart altogether from the discussions- of this Bill. &quot;On the advice of the Commander-in-Chief9 Home Forces, the ArmyCouncil desire to exercise these powers at an early date in order that training. of; the Home Guard may not be unduly delayed.      In pursuance of the PrimeMinister&apos;s promise, a debate has been&apos; arranged to take place in the House ofCommons on 18th December. ...For the purpose of that debate a Ihite Paper is being preparedexplaining the&quot;.scope of the proposed Defence Regulations.      The draft regulations are not yet, complete, but a copy. of the draft 7/hite Paper&apos;isattached showing the scope of the proposed. Regulations.      I desire as amatter of urgency to ask the Committee to consider as a question of policy theproposal to.apply compulsion, in the matter of continuance in the service andattendance for training and duty, to Home Guards already serving.This, proposal, if. adopted, would represent a new departure inconnection with part-time unpaid, service,.In the. areas Where compulsory enrolment is introduced there willbe serving side by side in the some units, men who have been compelled andothers who hove volunteered.Under what has been termed the &quot;housemaid&apos;s&quot; clause, members of theHome Guard at present are entitled to leave the organisation after giving a fortnight&apos;s notice.      It follows, therefore, that in the absence of any new arrangement in these units some of the men would be held for the duration ofthe war while others would remain at liberty to leave the Home Guard at anytime.The Home Guard is a voluntary citizen army, and the last thing thatI wish to do is to strike a blow at the spirit which has produced a magnificentforce of over one million ond half patriots,,On/
Oil the other hand, the more seriously minded elements in the HoneGuard itself, &quot;being determined to give their services and ta. give then iii the Home Guard, are, to the host of my &quot;belief, willing and anxxotis that&apos;theright to give notice should now he removed. . \      i. .  &apos; - .It is in general undesirable that at such a time of national dangeras the present;,, members of the Hone Guard should bo free to decide, that they donot v/ish to continue to serve with the organisation for which they originallyvolunteered,,I therefore propose to. make provision in the forthcoming defence regulations requiring men serving&apos; in&quot;the Home&quot; Guard after a specified date toco2itinue to serve in it for the rest of the emergency, unless their services are previously dispensed with.     The period of warning which the Array council have in mind would be at least a fortnight.      The Council do not anticipate that there will be many withdrawals:,;-and if .the incidence of withdrawal shouldbe heavy in particular areas,&apos; it &quot;will be&apos; open,,&apos; under thchegulatien, to applycompulsory enrolment in those areas.It will bo seen from the draft liite- Paper that&apos;, compulsory -attendance at parades is also contemplated, with penalties for non-attendance,to be imposed by Civil Courts.&quot; &quot; -2. The Army Council &quot;already have power under the Army Act to orderattendance for training and city and to court-martial offenders if an order is not obeyed, but.. - owing to the voluntary and unpaid character of the force,members are exempt from any form of summary punishment arid cannot be fined.: Consequently^,&apos; in practice, the powers under the Array Act have not been exercised to the point of trying by court-martial:members&apos;- who fail in thematter of attendance at parades, etc,3. -   I consider that those two proposals should stand or. fall -together.It would be idle to take powers to compel members of the Home..Guard to attendat specified times for duty or training, if the right to give a fortnight!notice remained,      That has been one of the difficulties in. securing a levelstandard of training hitherto.      On. the other hand, there would be little pointIn continuing to allow voluntary iry-enrolment into the HomevGuard for the duration of .:the-war, if no powers-were.- taken to ensure, that the Home Guard is adequatelytrained for the; very responsible services it may be - called upon to render,Moreover, I feel strongly that since compulsion in this form is in any case tobe applied&quot;.to - a part of the Home Guard,  it should be applied.to the whole..   The; Committee are, accordingly, invited to approve in principle., inrelation to already serving members of the Homo Guard:--(a) compulsory continuance in service,. subject to the right towithdraw before a stipulated elate;   and(b) compulsory attendance at parades, on the...same conditions asthose compulsorily enrolled in future.: . &apos; ..:   - .:&apos;,: vThe-War Office.    .0.&apos;&apos;   ft/;.&quot; \MN:   &apos;&quot;&apos;,&quot;&apos;. &apos;&quot; &quot; k;&apos;n &apos;&apos; e--&apos;.&apos;     &apos; &apos; 115th December., 19.11-./ .
The Home Guard is at present governed by the Defence(Local Defence/Volunteers) Regulations, 1940,which were originallymade in May,  1940.    Since that date there has been a gradualincrease in the obligations required of members of the public inconnection with measures of defence,  culminating in the NationalService (No. 2) Act,  1941.    As pointed out in paragraph 2 of theMemorandum on Man-Power (Cmd, 6,324) that Act (see Sec. l(b)) providesthat the liability of a person to some form of part^tinio NationalService includes liability to give part-time service in the armed forces,  the extent of that liability to be provided for by defence regulations.    In pursuance of this power, Defence Regulations willbe made on the following lines.In the first place, provision will be made enabling,the Minister of Labour and National Service or any National.. ServiceOfficer to direct any person in Great Britain to enrol in the home guard.    In the matter of nationality, the kinds of persons who can be so directed&apos;will be the same as those who can be called upfor whole-time national;; service under the National Service Acts,1939 &quot; 41*  &apos; It-is,proposed at the outset only to exorcise powersof compulsory ..enrolment in certain areas where an insufficientnumber of Home Guards is available under the voluntary, system of recruitment.    The areas and the numbers required will be determinedby the Minister of Labourand National Service in consultation withthe Army Council, as the requirements depend upon military considerations;&apos;.: : - Persons/Draft Memorandum on the principal new measures to be provided for by defence Regulations, under the powers conferred by the nationalService (No, 2&apos;) Act,  1941.
Persons to whom directions are given will be able to appeal againstthe directions on the same grounds as men called up for whole-timemilitary service,  i, e.  on grounds.....of hardship or. conscientiousobjection, - and will have recourse to&apos; the^appropriate tribunals.A man who foils, without reasonable cause,&quot;&apos;-to obey a direction to join the Home Guard will be liable- to trial in a civil court,and to incur, a penalty under Part V of the General defence regulations.Continuance In Service.Secondly, the Regulations will require Home Guards whojoin as directed,  to continue in the service until their services are dispensed with.    Normally, this will mean until the end of thepresent emergency, tut there will be. power to discharge a Koine Guardat any time for good, reasons. . . ..Compulsory attendance for duty.. Thirdly?,  a Home Guard who disobeys orders,  or absentshimself from duty will be rendered liable to summary conviction in a civil court, the maximum -penalty being one month&apos;s imprisonment or a fine of  10, or both.    The scale of punishment is that provided for civil Defence Workers including part-time &quot;conscripts&quot;.    In thisrespect, the procedure will be analogous to that applicable tomen of the Territorial -Army in peace-time who fail to attendpreliminary? or annual training.Application to serving members.The Regulations will further provide for applying to existing members of the Home Guard the requirements as to continuousservice,  and compulsory attendance for training and;duty.    members who have joined voluntarily and are unable to accept the revisedconditions of service will be given an opportunity of talcing theirdischarge before a date to be fixed.    Members continuing to servethereafter will thus lose the right to take their discharge at a fortnight&apos;s notice under paragraph 2(2) of the Defence (Local defence volunteers) Regulations, 1940. /
Tho periods of. training and duty which will be required of Home Guards will be- defined in instructions to be issued by thoArmy Council from time to time under the powers conferred upon themby the existing Regulations.    The assimilation of the conditionsof service of serving members of the Homo Guard to those applicableto compulsorily enrolled, members will remove tho anomaly which woaldexist if the two classes were serving side by side under different conditions.    Moreover, the provision of civil sanctions for failure to&apos;attend parades, etc. will enable fines to&quot;be imposed.    The militarcode, which alone applies at present, and will continue to apply, doenot provide for the imposition of fines.The foregoing proposals involve no change in the financial arrangements for the Home Guard.
