Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 68.July 16, 1941.WAR CABINET.REQUIREMENTS OF MAN-POWER FOR AERODROME DEFENCE and recruitment FOR WOMEN S SERVICES.Report by the Lord President of the Council.AT their Meeting on the 10th July (W.M. (41) 68th Conclusions, Minute 6),the War Cabinet: (1) Invited the following Ministers : The Lord President of the Council (Chairman),The Minister of Supply,The Minister of Labour and National Service,The Minister of Home Security, andThe three Service Ministers to consider the best means of meeting the additional requirements ofman-power for aerodrome defence which had recently been made.(2) Invited the Ministers referred to above, together with the Minister ofInformation, to consider what arrangements should be made, to preventoverlapping and competition between the recruitment of women forthe women&apos;s services, and to secure a fair allocation of the availablewomen.A report on these matters was to be submitted by the 17th July.Requirements of man-power for aerodrome defence.2. The outstanding requirements of man-power for this purpose fall into two parts:  (a) 14,000 men are wanted for class C aerodromes. The R.A.F. isat present responsible for the defence of these aerodromes, butthe question of transferring this responsibility to the Army isunder consideration. Provision of these 14,000 men has been includedin the R.A.F. requirements, as given to the Ministry of Labour and national Service. No additional commitment is thus involved, andfrom the man-power point of view it is immaterial whetherresponsibility for the defence of these aerodromes is undertaken bythe Army or by the Royal Air Force. 4,000 of these men are requiredby the 1st September, and the remaining 10,000 by March 1942.[22719]
(b) The Army require an additional 10,800 men. This may seem a smallfigure; but since the Minister of Labour and National Service agreeda short time ago to provide the Secretary of State for War with anintake of 150,000 men for the six months July-September 1941, therehave been further demands which bring this total up to 192,000(20,000 to replace battle casualties, 11,000 for fire-watching, 10,800for aerodrome defence). The total demands for the Army by theend of December exceed by 33,000 the man-power at present in sightto meet them.3. Over the next 12 months the estimated demands of man-power for thethree Fighting Services (i.e., excluding Civil Defence Services, Industry and casualties) amount to 722,000 men. In addition, about 170,000 women are wantedfor the A.T.S., and 100,000 women for the W.A.A.F., besides those needed forthe W.R.N.S.4. It is clear that there will be great difficulties in meeting man-powerdemands of this order, and that the situation can only be handled satisfactorilyby careful planning over a long period. The careful adjustment of theseconflicting claims is liable to be seriously disturbed, with grave injury to theproduction programmes, if additional demands, even though small in themselves,are put forward at short notice.5.   On this part of our reference we make the following submission : -(i) We take note that of the 14,000 nien required for the defence ofC. class aerodromes, 4,000 will be provided before the 1st September,1941, and the remaining 10,000 by March 1942. These 14,000 will beprovided from men already earmarked for the R.A.F. and constituteno additional demand,(li) The Minister of Labour has undertaken to find the 10,800 men requiredby the Army for the defence of the vital aerodromes as an addition tothe number which he had already agreed to provide by the end ofDecember 1941.(iii) While the immediate situation is thus met, a corresponding shortagemust, however, reveal itself later somewhere, and the source fromwhich this shortage is ultimately to be met should, in the first place,be considered by the Man-Power Committee.(iv) Having regard to the increasing difficulties of the man-power situation,and the need for preserving a balance between production and theneeds of the forces, the Minister of Labour should be brought into consultation before any further demands for additional man-power for the forces are authorised,(v) The whole man-power situation, in all its aspects, should be the subjectof a comprehensive review by the Man-Power Committee, and a report submitted before the end of September.Recruitment for Women&apos;s Services.6. Here, too, it is important to avoid clashes between the demands of thevarious services, and to arrange a co-ordinated scheme to ensure that the heavy demands are met in an orderly fashion.  We recommend as follows :  (i) The responsibility of the Minister of Labour and National service should be recognised as including the provision of the women (as ofthe men) required to meet the demands of the various Services, as defined by those Services within the limits of policy laid down by theWar Cabinet.(ii) The requirements of the Services and of industry for women should becorrelated by a Standing Inter-Departmental Committee comprising the Director-General of Man Power of the Ministry of Labour, as chairman, and representatives of the Service Departments and of theMinistry of Home Security. The latter would be responsible forrepresenting the interests of the Civil Defence and connected Services,such as the Nursing Service.
(iii) This Committee would decide what steps should be taken from timeto time to recruit women for the various Services, and would considerareas in which, or the Services in respect of which, special campaignsshould be undertaken, at particular times.(iv) The actual publicity in connection with recruitment campaigns should becarried out through the normal machinery of the Ministry ofInformation, and directed by a Committee of Public Relations Officersof the Departments named above, under the Chairmanship of an officerof the Ministry of Information.On behalf of the Committee :J. A.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 16, 1941.
