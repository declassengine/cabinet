29 The possible means by which these men can be sent home have beenfully explored.   M. Maisky suggested that one or two of the shipsrequisitioned should be released for this purpose0   This proposal was unacceptable because all the vessels are required for essential services byHis Majesty&apos;s Government and because acceptance would have impliedrecognition by His Majesty1 s Government of the Soviet Government&apos;s title tothe requisitioned vessels,,   He also suggested that British vessels shouldtake these men to Murmansk or to a port in the Persian Gulf0It is impossible    because of German forces in Norway to send a british ship to Murmansk, while repatriation of so large a number of men via thePersian Gulf could be arranged only at the sacrifice of some otherrequirement of our shipping programme.   This cannot be contemplated.3. M. Maisky then asked whether it would be possible to use the Balticships sheltering in Eire ports.   He was told tiiat if the Soviet Governmentcould arrange this, no obstacle would be put by His Majesty&apos;s Government intheir way and that steps would be taken, if required, to arrange for transport of the men to Eire to join the vessels.   The Soviet Government hasnot however been able to secure the use of these vessels which are thesubject of legal proceedings in Eire courts, moreover,it appears that theGovernment of Eire wish themselves eventually to requisition these ships.4. On finding that the liklihood of these vessels in Eire being available was slight, His Majesty&apos;s Government, wishing still to be helpful,approached the Finnish and the Swedish Legations in London for their assistance.   The Finnish Legation was unable to offer any accommodation inFinnish vessels; the Swedish Legation held out hopes of being able to repatriate these men in a ship or ships which they hoped would be sent tothis country to repatriate certain Swedish seamen and destitute Swedishnationals now in the United Kingdom.   After considerable delay the SwedishLegation have informed us that Sweden has given up the idea of sending a vessel to this country to pick up Swedish nationals and cannot thereforeassist in repatriating Soviet nationals.   The reason for this decision isthat they have recently lost three of their vessels while sailing under german safe conduct to SwedenQ   They have lost in addition one vessel whichwas released from our time-charter for the purpose of making the voyage home to Sweden with Swedish nationals,,   In view of the intensity of the warfarenow being waged in the Atlantic and North Sea the Swedes now state thatthey cannot afford to risk sending a passenger vessel from Sweden for thispurpose and have no other suitable ships available.   When Mo Maisky was informed of this development, he urged that representations should be made at stockholm; and H.M. Minister there has now been instructed to make such representations, in concert with his Soviet colleague, if possible.   TheSwedish Minister in London has since informed the Foreign Office that hisGovernment are intending to leave the Swedish seamen in this country owingSECRET. COPY NO.-- WAR CABINET.wp[gUU)36.,,  Memorandum, by the Minister of Shipping and Parliamentaryom APRIL. 1941* Under-Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsREPATRIATION OF BALTIC SEAMEN.1. Since October last when His Majesty&apos;s Government requisitioned theBaltic shipping in British ports, some ifOO of the seamen have opted forSoviet nationality and for return home.   At an early stage the soviet ambassador asked for facilities for their repatriation and, although theobligation to repatriate them is one which falls on the Soviet Governmentand not on His Majesty :s Government he vas told that we would give him what assistance we could.   The willingness of His Majesty1 s Government to helpwas intended in part to placate the ill-feeling which the requisitioning hadengendered in Moscow.
to the difficulty of sending a Swedish ship to fetch them.   We must await the Swedish Government&apos;s view, hut it would be most unwise to attempt topress the Swedes against their will to reverse this decision and this tolessen their goodwill which is more valuable to us in other directions,5. If the representations made to the Swedish Government do not succeedthere seems nothing to be done but to tell M. Mai sky once more that there patriation of persons claiming to be Soviet citizens is&apos;an obligation on theSoviet Government.   His Majesty&apos;s Government can do no more to help them and unless the Soviet Government are themselves willing to send one of their ownvessels to this country for the purpose, which should be well within their capacity, the repatriation-of these Soviet citizens must be indefinitelydeferred.6. It is preferable that at this moment any negotiations with theSoviet Government should not reach an impasse,  but, nevertheless there seemsto be no alternative to the course proposed in view of the present shipping situation,R.H.C.R.A.B.Ministry of Shipping,2nd April, 1941.-2-
