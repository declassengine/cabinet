( g)   (41) 89,September 2nd, 19410 Q05y.No_.j5a____________.WJBOASINIT..Interpretation of Point III of Atlantic Declaration.. in 2?expansion&amp;p$... of the&quot; Br itisfo Empirey__________________Memorandum by tile Secretary of State for the Colonies.1,,    The phrase in Point III of the&apos; Atlantic Charter that we&quot;respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live&quot; is difficult from the Colonial point ofview.     It was,  of course., used, as is obvious from the con text,withthe nations of Europe in mind,.     But in the Colonies we cannot admit aright of unfettered choice to those who,  in the words of the Leagueof Nations Covenants are &quot;not yet able to stand by themselves under thestrenuous conditions of the modern world&quot;.2c     The development of local Institutions to the fullestpracticable extent has been and is our policy*     But I am certain thatit would be premature to commit ourselves to the belief that this will eventually lead to fully responsible government for every unit withinthe Empire^      There are at least fifty governmental units in theColonial Empire and, although the number might be reduced by federation,many would still remain too small, while others are strategically tooimportant,  for them ever to become completely masters of their des tiny *There are others where at present a small minority is alone capable of exercising political power and where, for as far ahead as we can see,the interests of the great majority of the people can only be ensuredby the maintenance of our re spons ability *        Even in Ceylon whereresponsible government is in fact demanded by the Sinhalese majority,no solution has yet been found to secure the interests of Tamil andother minorities,.3o      I am sure,  thsrefc3:;e,  that we should be careful not to commit ourselves to fully responsible government as the goal for the wholeColonial Empire.     As sai f-government often means the name thing to the popular mind,  I should pa3-&apos;&quot;&quot;er-    not to meatier, self-aovarnnent    eitherand I hope that the fireb sentence of P-h     2 in Mi*6 Amery1 s drafstatement may be omitted.      It is not iaecessary to the argument and weshould avoid any implication that the free choice of the peonies of theEmpire would necessarily &quot;be for self-government,4.      The question arises whether anything should be added to thestatement in regard to the Colonial Empire,    The point at issue hasbeen raised unofficially in Gey Ion though not specifically elsewhere.It cannot however have escaped notiee0    If nothing is said about theColonies the statement might be made ay the Secretary of State forIndia in reply to a question.,      If on the other hand the Colonies are mentioned,it would be more appropriate that it should be made by thePrime Minister.:5c      It would be possible to acid something bh the following linesi-&quot;The Colonial Empire comprises peoples and territories ofmany different types aha with a wide variety of institutions,which have evolved in accordance with the particular history ancircumstances of each cass0    That evolution must continuationlines that accord with British conceptions of freedom and lajustice,&quot;Mo2nd Sep tercbe r, 194I0
