Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1941.SECEET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 158.December 19, 1941.WAR CABINET.DISCUSSIONS IN DUBLIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.WITH reference to the discussion at the &quot;War Cabinet meeting of the19th December (W.M. (41) 131), I attach two notes of my conversations in Dublinwith the United States Minister and with Mr. de Valera respectively.I am telegraphing to Washington as agreed at the Cabinet meeting.C.Dominions Office,December 19, 1941.Note of Conversation with the United States Minister at Dublin,December 16.I TOOK the opportunity of my visit to Dublin to have a full and frankdiscussion of the position with Mr. David Gray, the United States Minister there.&quot; Mr. Gray gave us the substance of a report on the position which he had justdrawn up for communication to his Government. The gist of this was that hewas satisfied that, in existing circumstances, even after the entry of the UnitedStates into the war, there was no immediate prospect of bringing Eire into thewar on the Allied side. The question, in his opinion, of the next step to be takendepended on the extent to which facilities in Eire were required in connectionwith the Battle of the Atlantic. If, as he understood, the need for facilities in eire was not acute at the moment, he thought that the policy to be pursuedshould be on the following lines : He had changed the view previously expressedby him as to the giving by the United States of arms to Eire and now thoughtthat it would be desirable that some supply of arms should be made. In view ofthe entry of the United States into the war, he thought that there was now no danger in supplying such arms. No Irish Government could bring the people ofIreland to take hostile action against both Britain and the United States.Although no public or definite commitment could be obtained from the eire government that the arms would not be used against the Allies, the result would,in practice, be the same. If, therefore, it were necessary to occupy bases in Eirelater, the gift of arms would not prove any serious embarrassment. On the otherhand, the fact that arms were being supplied by the United States would ensurethe maintenance of the sympathies of the great majority of the people of Eireon the Allied side. Before taking action in the matter, however, he was anxiousto learn whether we had any objection to his making such a recommendation tohis Government. He thought that, if his Government agreed, it would be helpful if the supply by them of arms to Eire could be well publicised, e.g., by the passageof special legislation through Congress authorising the supply of arms.On this point I said that it would clearly be difficult for us, in presentconditions, to give arms to Eire ourselves and to publish the fact in view of thestate of public opinion here.  I thought, however, that, if it were American policy to give arms to Eire in small quantities, such a policy would create less difficulties[23271]
for us. Before, however, I gave him a definite answer, I said that I would liketo consult the War Cabinet on the subject, and I promised to send him a replythrough our Representative in Dublin.Mr. Gray mentioned that, while the actual supply of arms to Eire should,in his view, be small and of a token character, it might, even so, be more convenient in practice that any supply should be made, in fact, through theUnited Kingdom vote at the United States request. In particular, he referredto the desirability of the supply to Eire of a small number of fighter aircraft.The present head of the Eire Air Force was extremely sympathetic to the allied cause and would no doubt be very willing to carry out such plans as he couldbehind the facade of neutrality by way of preparing for future co-operation withthe Allies. He was, however, hindered from doing so at present owing to theabsence of any air force in Eire whose existence could justify the erection of substantial facilities such as air-observer units, aerodromes, &amp;c.Note of Conversation with Mr. de Valera, December 17.I had a long, friendly, but fruitless talk with Mr. de Valera this morning.After an exchange of compliments and a few reminiscences of Geneva, we gotdown to the subject of my visit. He began immediately on Partition. He saidthat if the question had been settled in the years before the war, as he had wished,he thought, though he was not sure, that he could have brought his country intoa defensive alliance with Great Britain. Now, the opportunity had been lost.It was true that a certain section of Irish opinion was so impressed with theGerman danger that they might be willing to co-operate with us to defeat it.But an equally large section held the view that so long as a part of their country was actually occupied by an alien Power, which had always been their enemy in the past, they could not align themselves with that Power to repel anothergreat Power from invading the remainder of their country. He rather indicated that he did not himself hold so extreme a view, so I interrupted to say that I understood that his personal prestige in Eire was so great that he could persuade the people to do anything he wished. Could he not use his influence in thismatter ? He said that it was true that his personal position was strong. Butit rested on the fact that he represented the views of his country. If he tried to lead them in a direction in which they did not want to go, his influence wouldbe gone and the country would be split from top to bottom. Until the questionof Partition was settled, there was no chance of Eire abandoning her neutrality.I pointed out that this was a counsel of despair. The continuation of Irishneutrality in itself was bound to postpone indefinitely a solution of the Partitionproblem. For if Eire remained neutral until the end of the war, neither theBritish people nor the people of the Six Counties would consider any form ofunification of the two territories, involving the handing over of the northernports, which had proved essential to our survival, to a Government which had failed to stand by our side in the present emergency. He said that he recognisedsome postponement of the solution of Partition might be inevitable. He did not,however, rule out the possibility that after the war different counsels wouldprevail. For his part, he would be prepared to agree to the Ulster Parliamentretaining all its present powers. All that need be transferred to an all-ireland parliament were those powers which were at present exercised by the imperial parliament. In return for this concession, he thought that he could bring Eireinto a joint strategic plan for the defence of the British Isles. I said that whatever might or might not be the merits of this proposal, it was for the momententirely academic. In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the only chanceof bringing nearer a unification of Ireland lay in the North and South of Irelandfighting together in the present war and thus creating a community of interest.That was the essential prerequisite, by way of which alone it was possible thatthe end he had in view might be approached. For Eire to link her entry into thewar with a solution of the Partition question, which was necessarily a long-term problem, was to ignore the urgency of the present position. We must be practical.Eire had much to gain by entering the war on the Allied side now. What, in fact,were the two main dangers facing her to-day ? A shortage of supplies andinvasion by Germany. Both these dangers might largely be averted if she were willing to take her stand with Great Britain and the United States.   So far as
supplies were concerned, we should be bound to help her, as an ally, in a way which we should not be justified in doing while she remained neutral. As things were at present, we were bound to consider our own needs first. We were fightinga war. We could not afford to go short. But, were she to come in with us, weshould consider her needs equally with our own. Moreover, there would be more to go round. As a result of the facilities which she afforded, both naval and air,less merchant ships would be sunk in the Atlantic, more goods would reach ourshores, and of these she would get her share. The same considerations appliedto invasion. If she gave us a private undertaking that she would come into thewar at a given date, we could in the meantime fill her up with arms, and by thetime any public announcement was made, she would be ready, with the eollabo-ration of us and the United States, to ward off any German attacks which resulted from her entry into the war. It might be that Mr. de Valera was unwilling to buy a pig in a poke. In that case, I suggested that he might liketo send over an emissary privately to London, who could discuss with the Chiefsof Staff the amount of armaments which we could make available to her in theevent of her being prepared to join the Allies. In this way, the Irish Governmentwould know where they stood before they made their decision. There should betime for this. In the view of our experts, the danger of invasion was not imminent.Germany was tied up in Russia. It was, too, probable that the weight of german air attack would never again be so heavy or sustained as it was last year.Mr. de Valera agreed broadly with my assessment of the dangers facingSouthern Ireland, and recognised that they might be largely alleviated if Eiretook the course I suggested. But he said that there still remained the issue of partition. That must be solved first. I asked him whether he could afford totake so detached an attitude. I pointed out the lesson of Norway, Holland andBelgium. These small countries had taken up the same attitude as he was takingnow. They had failed to call on their friends in time for help. And what hadbeen the result ? They had been overrun. Could not Ireland profit by their experience ? He said that lamentable though the experience of these countries had been, he thought that they had taken up the right attitude in maintaining their neutrality as long as possible, and he would do the same. If Germanyattacked Ireland, Ireland would be united in resisting her. But till then, she must avoid taking sides.He then reverted to the question of arms. He made it perfectly clear thathe did not anticipate an invasion by us. Why then could we not give Irelandarms, even though she remained neutral ? The very fact that she had them wouldhearten her people, and from this it was conceivable that some stiffening in theirpresent attitude towards Germany might result. Britain and Eire would, hesaid, in fact, if not in appearance, &quot; be standing side by side, in a common cause.&quot; We ran no risks by supplying these arms. Eire would not attack usunless we first attacked her. She needed, in particular, anti-tank guns, Brenguns, A.A. guns, and mechanical transport. Could we not make some of theseavailable ? The very fact that the Germans knew that she had these armamentswould reduce the danger of their invading her. I explained that arms whichmight well be given to a co-belligerent for immediate use could hardly be sparedfor a neutral. They were badly needed elsewhere now. I would, however, reportwhat he had said. He also suggested the possibility that he might send materials for clothing and more food, at an economic price, to pay for the armaments whichwe sent to Eire, though he explained that this would need a good deal ofworking out.He was throughout extremely friendly and outspokenly sympathetic to ourcause. He asked for my views as to the new situation arising from the entry of Japan into the war. I told him that it was the unanimous view of the Cabinet,even taking into account the American losses at Pearl Harbour and the sinking of the Prince of Wales, that, taking a long view, we had gained on balance. Thecoming of the United States into the war made ultimate victory certain. we might have further setbacks in the Far East. But the German position was deteriorating and, once she was dealt with, we, Russia, China and the UnitedStates could polish off Japan. He said that he, too, had now come to the conclusionthat we should win the war. His difficulty in rallying to the Allied cause camenot from lack of sympathy, but because, he said, in existing circumstances, withthe Partition problem an open sore, any attempt to bring a United Ireland intothe war at our side would be doomed to failure. From this position, I could notbudge him.
