Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1941.SECRET. Copy No.    58W.P. (G) (41) 19.February 6, 1941.WAR CABINET.SUNDAY OPENING OE CINEMAS AND THEATRES.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.UNDER the existing law public performances on Sunday in theatres andmusic halls (that is to say, performances to which persons are admitted on pay-ment) are prohibited. As regards cinematograph entertainments, after thepassing of the Cinematograph Act, 1909, which entrusted to Local authorities the licensing of cinemas, the practice grew up of giving Sunday performances in aid of charity. Some of the licensing authorities, notably the London CountyCouncil, decided to bring the practice under control and gave their consent toSunday opening subject to certain conditions, including the payment of a proportion of the profits to approved charities. By 1930 the majority of cinemasin London were giving Sunday performances and their example was followed insome of the provincial towns. An action was then brought by the theatricalinterests to test the legal position. As a result the opening of cinemas on Sundayswas held to be illegal and legislation had to be introduced to regularise the existing position. The Sunday Entertainments Act, 1932, legalised the Sunday openingof cinemas in areas where Sunday opening had previously taken place and enabledLocal Authorities in other areas to obtain powers for the purpose if the majorityof electors indicated their desire for the change. The Act of 1932 required one day&apos;s rest in seven for all employees, the payment of a proportion of the profitsto charity, and a prescribed percentage to the Cinematograph Fund (which is mainly devoted to the support of the British Film Institute).2. Under the Sunday Entertainments Act, 1932, the Sunday opening ofcinemas in areas where Sunday opening had not previously been allowed wassubjected to certain requirements as to procedure. The Local Authority isrequired to prepare and publish a draft order. In a Borough or Urban Districta. public meeting must be held. If a poll is required by no less than one hundredelectors, a poll must be taken. If the Order is approved in accordance with this procedure, it must be submitted to the Home Secretary and laid before parliament and approved by a resolution passed by each House.In December 1939, Defence Regulation 42B was passed enabling LocalAuthorities, on the receipt of a certificate from the competent naval, military or air force authority certifying that the opening of cinemas on Sunday is expedient for the forces quartered in a particular area, to obtain Orders for this purposefrom Parliament without the necessity of taking a, poll of the electors.3. When the Defence Regulation was under consideration in November and december 1939 it was decided to limit the simplified procedure to areas wheretroops were quartered, partly because there was no great demand for an extensionof Sunday opening in other areas and partly because it was felt that there wouldbe less opposition to the proposal if the change were limited to cases where Sunday opening was thought desirable for the benefit of the troops. &apos;[22194]
Representations, however, have been made that Sunday opening is expedientnot onlv in the interest of the troops, but in the interest of industrial workers;and I &quot;submitted to the Home Policy Committee a proposal that defence regulation 42B should be extended to cover cases where a certificate is given on behalf of the Ministry of Labour by the Chairman of an Area Board indicating that such a change is desirable &apos;&apos; having regard to the fact that the conditionsin which industrial work is carried on in, or the neighbourhood of, a particular area have substantially changed by reason of circumstances arising out of war conditions.&quot; . in&apos;V V&apos;It was, however, represented to the Home Policy Committee on behalf of theMinister of Labour that in his view such a change m the law would not go far enough. I have not yet had the advantage of seeing the memorandum of theMinister of Labour, but I understand his view to be that the Sunday opening ofcinemas should be allowed in all areas, or at any rate in all areas in England andWales where a certificate is given by the military authority or by the Area Board,regardless of the question whether the Local Authority or the majority of thelocal residents approve of the change or not. The Minister does not, I under ^stand, suggest that this proposal should apply to Scotland.4. The first question for the War Cabinet is, therefore, whether the principleof local option in the matter of the Sunday opening of cinemas a principle which has been in operation since the Cinematograph Act, 1909 shall be abolished.The abolition of local control would, of course, be welcomed by thecinematograph industry, who have already made representations to me asking thatthey should have freedom to open on Sundays wherever they wish, and that theyshould be relieved of the requirement of a charitable contribution.One of the arguments in favour of the abolition of local control is that some local Authorities show an unreasonable objection to Sunday opening. It is saidthat a few Local Authorities have declined to take the necessary steps to authoriseSunday opening despite the receipt of a certificate from the competent military authority, and that in some cases when the Local Authority has, on the receiptof such a certificate, taken steps to authorise Sunday opening, the licensing authority (which in many areas consists of the local justices), have been obstructiveand have inserted unreasonable conditions, such as a condition that only soldiersin uniform shall be admitted to cinemas on Sundays.I hope to get some information as to the approximate number of cases inwhich Local Authorities have refused to act on the certificate of a competentmilitary authority, and as to the cases in which there has been obstruction by the insertion of unreasonable conditions. It is, of course, easy to make much of afew exceptional cases, and I think it will probably be found that the number ofcases in which the Local Authorities have refused to act reasonably is small. I fully realise the arguments in favour of allowing cinemas to be opened on Sundaysin places where there are substantial numbers of people who as a result of war conditions have a special need for recreation and amusement on Sunday, and Ihave it in mind, when my enquiries are completed, to send a circular to all LocalAuthorities pointing out the importance of making full use of their powers toauthorise Sunday opening, and emphasising the objections to any conditions ofan unreasonably restrictive nature.I am, however, convinced that it would be unwise to attempt to abolish localcontrol. Any attempt to abolish local control would inevitably arouse strong opposition from religious bodies and probably from the Local Authorities, and Ido not know of any good answer to the contention that conditions vary indifferent parts of the country, that local feeling on the question of Sunday observance varies in different parts of the country, that account must be taken of the sincere and conscientious feelings of many people on this subject and thatthere is no justification for overriding in this matter the wishes of the majorityof the local residents. The Churches have not been unreasonable in this matterand I think it would be both unfair and inexpedient to make so serious a breachin the present system which has been generally accepted.My own view, therefore, is that the principle of local option should beretained, but that steps should be taken to secure that full and proper use is madeby Local Authorities of their option (a) by amending Defence Regulation 42 Bso as to cover the interests of the workers as well as the interests of the troops;
Home Office, February 6, 1941.and (b) by a Home Office circular to Local Authorities calling attention to theadvantages of Sunday opening in proper cases and to the importance of avoidingall unreasonably restrictive conditions.Theatres.5. Representations have been made to me on behalf of the theatricalprofession, including managers, actors and trades unions, that the opening oftheatres on Sundays should be allowed. I recognise that a Defence Regulationon this subject would be a more difficult proposition than a Defence Regulationon the subject of the Sunday opening of cinemas. In the first place, the existing law as contained in the Sunday Entertainments Act of 1932 has alreadyrecognised the principle that Local Authorities may allow cinemas to be openedon Sunday, and, as regards cinemas, all that has been done or is proposed to bedone by a Defence Regulation is to simplify the procedure by which LocalAuthorities can make orders for this purpose. In the second place, a defence regulation facilitating the opening of cinemas on Sundays can easily be justified as desirable for the efficient prosecution of the war. It is less clear that facilitiesfor the opening of theatres can be justified for the purpose of the efficient prosecu-tion of the war, seeing that the Home Office has no evidence of any substantialdemand from the public for this form of Sunday entertainment.... Moreover, aproposal to allow the opening on Sunday of theatres, which would include varietyshows, would be more controversial than any proposal to extend the existing facilities for the Sunday opening of cinemas.Nevertheless, it is difficult to find any sufficient reason for treating theatresdifferently from cinemas. The theatres have been very badly hit by war conditions.Facilities for Sunday opening would do something to help the industry; and ifit is desirable that under war conditions there should be special facilities forSunday entertainments, it does not seem to me right to exclude theatricalentertainments. On the contrary, it seems to me desirable to do what is possibleto help the dramatic art to continue to exist.Accordingly, if the Cabinet are prepared to take the view that facilities forthe opening of theatres on Sunday would contribute to the efficient prosecution of the war, I suggest that a Defence Regulation should be made providing that local Authorities, on the receipt of a certificate from the competent military or industrial authority, may make orders permitting theatres to be open on Sundays.It would, however, be desirable, before making such a change, to ascertainthat it would be supported by Parliament, and such a Defence Regulation oughtto contain a provision deferring the date of its operation, so that parliament might have an opportunity of praying against it before it becomes operative.6. It would not be practicable to apply to theatres the condition that a contribution shall be made to charity, but I should be prepared to defend adifferentiation in this matter between cinemas and theatres. The principle of a distinction between cinemas and theatres has already been accepted in the matterof the entertainments tax.7. The Sunday Entertainments Act, 1932, and the provisions of defence regulation 42 B amending that Act apply only to England and Wales : theyhave no application to Scotland; and the proposals in this memorandum for amending Defence Regulation 42 B relating to cinemas, and for making anotherDefence Regulation relating to theatres, would also be inapplicable to Scotland,where I understand the legal position and practice as regards Sunday openingare entirely different.H.
