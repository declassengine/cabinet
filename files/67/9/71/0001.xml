(G)(41)  71.COPY NOfrith July, 1941.WAR    CABINET.IMPROVED STREET LIGHTING.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.At the meeting on 30th December, 1940 (w.P.(G)(40) 530), reported on the attitude of the Associations of LocalAuthorities towards the introduction of the scheme of improvedstreet lighting which had been previously discussed on25th October, 1940,  (W.M.(40)  277, Minute 6), and said that Ihad come to the conclusion that it would be undesirable toattempt to obtain an improvement during the winter of 1940/41.The War Cabinet agreed that the question of improved street lighting should be deferred until the summer of 1941, when itcould be reconsidered in the light of the conditions obtaining&apos;at the time.The Associations concerned, namely the Association of municipal Corporations, the Urban District Councils Association,and the Association of Counties of Cities.in Scotland, have again been consulted and are unanimous in opposing the scheme.The Urban District Councils Association report that there is nodemand for the higher intensity lighting and point out that their estimates for 1941-2, which have in many caseil ready beenadopted, contain no provision for the expenditure involved.The same view is strongly held by the Standing JointCommittee of the Metropolitan Boroughs.      Any increase in street lighting would in their view axcite public apprehension and wouldbe most unpopular.It is clear that the public still attach theitestimportance to the maintenance of as completeblackout as possible and that the local authorities,  on whom it would fall to giveeffect to the scheme, take the same view.      I do not considerthat it would be advisable to press them further to accept ahigher standard of street lighting for the coming winter,  andI recommend therefore that action be deferred until there is some evidence that a change would moot with more approval fromthe public and local authorities,H.M.,^ OFFICE.24th July 1941
