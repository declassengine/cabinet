W.P.(C.)(4l) 16.SECRET.COPY NO4th February, 1941.WAR   CABINET.Entertainments on Sundays.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1.     Two reasons lead me to press on my colleagues the need to abandon present restrictions on the provision of entertainments on Sundays.     Both are directly connected with the efficient prosecution of the war.     First, the necessities of production require an ever increasing number of men and women to go and work far from their homes.     They have to live in lodgings orbillets away from home comforts and friends and are, therefore, far more thannormally dependent on organised entertainment on their rest days.     Secondly,the necessities of production, in so far as long hours have to be worked and long distances travelled, combined with the effects of the black-out and bombing, make it increasingly difficult for all workers, including thoseliving in their own homes to go to cinemas during the week.     In the case ofall workers, but especially in the case of those transferred away from home,I am satisfied that the provision of entertainment at convenient times is most desirable in the interests of maximum production.     It helps to avoid the staleness and boredom which are inevitable, in some degree, in thecircumstances of today.     Many workers in lodgings have nowhere to go on sunday afternoon and this makes winter afternoons especially dreary.     for reasons which are obvious, the only practicable way tOjjprovide moreentertainment for these men and women who are busy all?week is to provide iton Sundays.2.     The need is a national and also an urgent one.     For both these reasons am opposed to any plan which would enable a reluctant Local Authority eitherto prevent or to delay its realisation.     This would be especially unfortunatein any district where the need arises primarily to meet the difficulties oftransferred workpeople.     It is essential that the Local Authority should nothave the power to condemn these strangers to their area to do without thecinema on Sunday which is a partial recompense for having to live away from home.     Past experience makes it certain that if Local Authorities are giventhe duty to decide whether or not to accept proposals, there will in allcases be delay and in several frustration.3.     It may, nevertheless, be desirable to make an exception in the case ofScotland.     This would meet the practical difficulty likely to arise owing tothe strong feeling in Scotland regarding Sunday observance.4.     Even if Local Authorities are no longer allowed to prevent the opening ofcinemas in their areas by maintaining the present general ban, the law, as it stands, will compel individual proprietors to obtain licenses from the licensing Authorities.     It will be necessary to ensure that the new law is so framed that an Authority cannot, by withholding licenses, or imposingunreasonable terms, in effect defeat the purpose in view:   experience showsthat this has been done in certain cases.5,     My own view is that theatres should also be allowed to open on Sundayprovided that no one is allowed to work more than six days a week.6, Billiard Halls and Rooms are at present closed on Sundays wherever paymenthas to be made.     These should also be open.(Initd.)   E,B.4th February, 1941,H.Q.52-72 B.K
