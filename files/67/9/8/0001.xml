(THIS DOCUMSMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAieiC MAJESTIES GOVERNMENT).SECRET.(P.E.(4l) 8). COPY NO._WAR   CABINET. &apos;PRODUCTION EXECUTIVE.Note by Minister of Labour and National Service..HEADS&apos; OF LABOUR POLICY.1*     The Minister of Labour and National Service, after consultation with theSupply Department concerned, may declare the work of any undertaking or partof an undertaking to be national work.Note; The Supply Department concerned is the Department interested in maintaining, output of the goods or services of the undertaking,including the Board of Trade, in respect of goods or services notfalling within the scope of any other Department.2.     On national work the following conditions will apply:( i) No employee may leave his employment and no employer may terminate the employment of any employee without the permission of a NationalService Officer or of an industrial tribunal on appeal from suchOfficer.(ii) The.Minister, after &quot;consultation with the Supply Department concerned,may prescribe proper arrangements in respect of personnel management and workshop consultation and may also prescribe -a mini mum period of notice of termination of employment by either side.Note: As regards (i) the action of a National Service Officer in givingor refusing permission for termination of employment will be .guided by instructions from the Minister settled after consultationwith the Supply Departments concerned.   Where the employer and employee are in agreement permission as a rule will be grantedautomatically.     These instructions must make it possible for the employer to dismiss workpeople either for proved misconduct or forunsuitability, though in the latter case, as suggested in.     ,:paragraph        below, the Minister may need to. take some- responsibilityfor finding other work*.     The new regulations-.will-not&quot; interferewith the power of the employer at any time to suspend an&apos;-employeefor. misconduct, but suspension and dismissal may thereafter be challenged before a tribunal.   - .3*     The minister subject to being satisfied that the wages and- conditions ofwork are suitable and that adequate provision exists for the housing, feedingand transport of the workpeople concerned j will use his powers of registration and of direction through National Service Officers to whateverextent may be necessary to ensure an :adequate supply of labour on national work.4.     The Minister will be prepared to use his powers of direction forthwithfor this purpose&apos; in respect of:. .- (a) men registered for military service but not called up on medical grounds; - -   -        ,(b) men exempted from military service by tribunals on condition of &apos;taking work of national importance;(c).men or women-unemployed.
5.     With a view to fair selection of others, to &quot;be directed to nationalwork the Minister will either by legislation or by Industrial RegistrationOrders provide for the compulsory registration of men and women by age-groupseither nationally or in particular regions.Note; Registration will apply to women as well as to men, but selectionfrom those registered for transfer voluntarily or by direction to national work will be governed by regulations and, as stated&quot;below, will be subject in every case to appeal on grounds of hardship.     Registration would naturally begin in the case ofwomen with the younger ages and no woman with domesticresponsibilities would normally be required, to leave her home,but it is probably not desirable to confine registration tosingle women.6.     Direction to take work will be on the following conditions:(i) The wage will be the rate for the job in the place in which thework is to be performed together with lodging and travellingallowances where appropriate.(ii) Any person may appeal against a direction to an Industrial Tribunalon the ground of hardship.Note; Where direction by the Minister to take National work involvesleaving employment it may be necessary for the Minister toassume some kind of responsibility for offering work either with one or with a succession of employers for not less than six months.The form in which this undertaking should be cast needs carefulconsideration.     It &quot;will also be necessary to consider whetherit would be practicable to apply to persons compulsorilytransferred arrangements for reinstatement in their previousemployment similar to those which apply to persons called-upfor the Forces.7.    -Industrial tribunals will be established (a) to deal with complaints of termination of employment contrary to the provisions of paragraph 2 and tomake such orders for compensation, re-instatement or return to work as may be proper, (b) to hear appeals against the refusal of a National Service officer to- give permission for termination of employment, (c) to hear appeals againstdirections of National Service Officers to take national work.8.     The scheme of reservation from military service will be re-cast with aview to basing reservation increasingly on the actual work done by each man aswell as on his age and occupation.     For this purpose a Register of Protectedwork with specially low ages of reservation -will be prepared by the Ministryof Labour in consultation with the supply Departments.     All national work willbe protected,- though it is probable that there will be a good deal ofprotected work with low reservation ages that may not. be declared to benational.9.     The Minister may make regulations:(a) determining the constitution and procedure of Industrial Tribunals,(b) defining the matters to be taken into account by Industrial Tribunals.: in considering complaints&apos;of termination of employment, appealsagainst direction to work or against refusals to give permission to leave work.10.   If in regard to any undertaking declared to be national work the minister is satisfied that the Managers are unable or unwilling to make suitable arrangements for personnel management or workshop consultation, he mayeither (a) appoint a personnel controller for that undertaking with whom shallrest responsibility for all engagements and terminations of employment andfor such other matters touching the welfare of the employees as the minister may determine;,   or (b) report, the matter to the Supply Department concernedwith a view to the replacement of the managers by others.H.Q.414-70 A.K.
