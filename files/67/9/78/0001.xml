THE BLACK-OUT: MINISTRY OF SUPPLY VEHICLES AND FACTORIES.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security and the Secretary of State for Air.1. The use of headlights is permitted on all classes of vehicleprovided that they are masked as required by paragraph 17 ofthe Lighting Restrictions Order, 1940.     The regulation maskfurnishes a light adequate for driving at reasonable- speedsand its use should not interfere unduly with dispatch of goods and conveyance of passengers.The use of masked headlamps is permitted during &quot;alerts&quot;and transport is not normally held up by the presence of hostile aircraft.     The police have been instructed not toexercise their power to require extinguishment in such a way asto lead to the interruption of traffic or of the transport ofworkers.From the outset the Air Staff have emphasised that, evenmasked, the headlamp involves some degree of risk.     Aerialobservation has shown that it may in certain conditionsafford guidance to enemy pilots.     This risk has hitherto been accepted in view of the national importance of road transport, but a change in enemy tactics might necessitate a review of the position.The use of unmasked headlamps would involve grave danger to life and property.     The lines of the main roads and theirconvergence on important centres would be clearly indicated,and the enemy would be guided to his objectives.     The positionof the factories themselves would be betrayed, and the risk tothe urban population substantially increased.     Even withheadlamps masked it has sometimes been found necessary tosuggest the diversion of traffic from the immediate vicinity of important targets, and even to control the use of pedalcycle lamps by employees approaching or leaving a factory.If the request were allowed for the Ministry of Supply itcould not be refused for other essential services, and docks,railways, aircraft factories, etc., might with equal justicedemand the same facilities.     The result would be that the black-out as a policy went by the board.     The Services, who havea similar problem, have appreciated those considerations, and though not subject to the Lighting Restrictions Order, havefitted their vehicles with masks complying with its requirements.They have restricted the use of an unmasked lamp to occasionswhere it is absolutely necessary in the interests of Serviceoperations.2. The suggestion that factories should continue to operate afterthe black-out has been destroyed similarly involves seriousrisks both to the factories, and to the general public,illumination of the target would facilitate its completedestruction by converting area bombing into aimed bombing, end^he loss of production might be permanent instead of temporary.^ is asking much of thu men to require them to continue work ina building that is patently open to attack.C,)  (41) 78.August 1941.WAR   CABINET.
It has...also to be borne in mind&apos; that factories are in manycases situated in groups or.closely associated with major docksystems&apos;or railway centres,  a. To; enable the enemy to identifysuch a group or centre might be disastrous.Where, as is sometimes; the case,; factories are in densely populated areas the safety and morale of the general.population .      Iis another important consideration.;.   The public realise that &apos;!the proximity of an important -objective adds to. their dangers,and expect all possible steps to .bo..taken to minimise the danger.. &apos; &apos; IThe confidence of the workers themselves depends on their being satisfied that all possible protection is being given to their :families.     If black-out requirements were waived the effectboth on the general population and on the factory workers might.be very serious.It should be added .that the ad interim report of theCommittee on Concealment and Deception (under the Chairmanship ofMr. Mabane)f which has been adopted by the Civil DefenceCommitteei;^&apos;-emphasises that the. black-out is the essential .  .background:of all maans of deception.and concealment. ,. Thefact that decoy lights are used to..: draw bombs from, vital &quot;targetsshould be a sound reason why lights should not.be used in and&quot;around vital targets.  -.H.M..V- -    .   v.     v . .A.H.M.S.HOME OFFICE.25th August 1941.The departments represented, on the Committee are&apos;:- &apos;-&quot;Ministry of Home Security .Air Ministry .admiralty war office ministry of supply ministry of.
