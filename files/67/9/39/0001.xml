Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1941.SECRET. Copy NoW.P. (G) (41) 39.April 11, 1941.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT OF OVERSEAS CIVILIAN TECHNICALCORPS OF VOLUNTEERS FROM THE U.S.A.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. IN accordance with the Conclusions of the War Cabinet (20th Meeting,.Item 6 (5)), of the 24th February, preliminary discussions with the Departmentsconcerned have taken place and they reveal the need for recruiting in the UnitedStates (for service with the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force) some21,000 skilled men mainly in the engineering and electrical trades, in addition tosome 9,000 radio mechanics.2. The United States authorities in Washington have considered a proposal that a public appeal should be made for volunteers for service as radio mechanicswho were ostensibly to be invited to proceed to Canada for training in a civilianschool, but would subsequently have been enlisted in the R.C.A.F. for service inthis country.3. After full consideration, the United States authorities have regretfullyconcluded that the laws of the United States could not be stretched to givesanction to it.4. The State Department would, however, agree to the recruitment of a civilian Technical Corps, the members of which would not be enlisted in the armed forces or be required to undertake combatant duties, but would be employedon the servicing and repair of the technical equipment used by the armed forces.5. Recruiting for the Corps would be open and would be openly supportedby friendly American organisations and individuals.6. This proposal has been examined by the Service Departments as well asby the Treasury, Foreign Office and Ministry of Labour, and, while it is not as satisfactory as a scheme of enlistment in the R.C.A.F. would have been, it isregarded as a practicable alternative.7. Drafts of the Defence Regulations which would be required for theestablishment of the Corps and of the Order and Instructions to be made there-under have been prepared and are annexed.8. I ask for the approval of the War Cabinet to the establishment of anOverseas Civilian Technical Corps to be recruited in the United States under theforegoing arrangements.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, April 11, 1941.[22418]B
