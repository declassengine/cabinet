2.     We cannot expect delivery of orders placed in the United Statesand Canada before the autumn of 1941,   Prom then until the end of 1942 ourtonnage should be augmented by 360,000 gross tons from the United Statesand by 108,000 gross tons from Canada,3.     Against the estimated net loss of about 2.% million gross tons wemay set whatever secondhand tonnage it may prove possible to purchase.   Itis difficult to give an estimate for this, but since the 1st October wehave purchased 238,835 tons gross and we have put in bids for a further125,000 tons gross of U.S. ships.   The pool of available tonnage for purchase is, of course, nearing exhaustion,*4.     On the 1st October last we had in all i85 million gross tons ofBritish shipping of 500 tons and over.   On the figure shown above,excluding possible purchases of secondhand vessels, this will be reducedto about 16 million gross tons by the 30th September next, a reduction ofabout 15^2.   If the tonnage in Military and Naval Service remains at thepresent level of about 4^: million gross tons so that the losses have to fall on the balance of 14 million gross tons, the reduction would be about20?S,   Replacement, however, must be related not only to British losses butalso to total British, Allied and Neutral losses since the latter have nomeans of replacement.   This means that replacement at the current rate ofli million tons must be related to a total current annual rate of loss of5^: million tons i,e, the rate over period since collapse &quot;of France.It should further be &quot;borne in mind that the brunt of these lossesfalls upon 15^ million tons (British, Allied and Neutral) trading to U.K,ports.   Moreover, about if million tons of these 15^ million tons are outof action being under repair.   My Department and the Admiralty aretherefore considering, with reference to the discussion at the War Cabineton 6th November ,   how to expedite the placing of further extensive ordersfor ships in the United States,     Diplomatic and other representations arebeing made to the American Administration with a view to  inducingto assist us to obtain in the United States fast cargo and passenger linersnow under construction, to meet the large and growing demands for thetransport of service personnel and stores,5,     I attach fuller notes on these points, together with a brief account of secondhand tonnage purchased by my Department since the outbreakof war,R.H.G.Ministry of Shipping,10th January, 19410SECRET.

For the information of the War Cabinet I wish to set out on &quot;broadlines the relation of our shipping losses to probable replacements duringthe period October, 1st 1940 to September 30th  1941.Estimated Shipbuilding.Gros3 tons.United Kingdom - Hong Kong .,...........................   1,228,000Estimated Losses of British Ships.Taken as four times the losses of vessels of 500gross tons and over in the quarter 1st October to31st December, 1940.................................... 4,000,000Estimated Net Loss (British Ships only)........... 2 , 772,000
NOTiJS OH SHIPBUILDING- AMD SHIP PURCHASE.Shipbuilding in the British Empire.1.     A Statement is attached showing the estimated output of Merchant tonnagefrom British shipyards (including Hohg Kong) in each quarter of the twelvemonths October 1st, 1940, to September 30t&apos;h, 1941,     The figures are derivedfrom the Builders&apos; estimates of delivery dates,,     The estimated output for the twelve months shown is approximately Ig; million gross tens, but the Admiraltyconsider the builders&apos; estimates too optimistic.2. The table below compares present estimates of total output in each half of1940 and the first half cf 1941 with previous estimates:Jan,-June 1940July-Dec. 1940No,  ;Gross tensNo.  gross tonsJan.-June 1941No.   Gross tonsEstimate submitted to cabinet Dec. 1939Estimate made inMay, 1940Present Estimate948066427.752341.615304.999i 10584436.668493.14876  j 418.824125120739.545650.140131     658.4703. The disparity between actual deliveries January to December, 1940, and theearlier estimates is due to over-optimism in the Builders&apos; estimates, to increasing Naval demands on Yards, and to the &quot;bottle-neck&quot; in the production omachinery for ship construction.4. The latest estimate allows a minimum of ten months for the production of afinished vessel. I should like to see this period substantially reduced, even to that achieved in the last war (7 - 8 months).The Admiralty hope to increase the rate of production by utilising for merchant Ship-building some berths which have been occupied with naval construction, by supply of midship steel sections from the United States, bystandardising engine production, and by extension of welding.     Even so, weshall depend for this output of 1^ million gross tons upon suffering nointerruption in the supply of raw material or in shipbuilding work through eneaction.5.      I have, moreover, decided, in agreement with the Admiralty War Staff, thatit is essential to construct more cargo liners of 15 or 16 knots, which,especially from the engine point of view, taks much longer to build than tramps,If no further special measures are taken, this decision will reduce the total annual output of l^ million gross tons by 80,000 tons.     I urge that, in spiteof the variation in the programme, its total should be maintained.II,    Shipbuilding on British account in the United States.6.     On November 6th, the V;ar Cabinet approved the placing of an order for60 ships of 6,000 gross tons or 9,300 tons deadweight in the United States, ffl*delivery between Autumn 19*1 and the end of 1942; or earlier if possible.During that period, our tonnage will be augmented from this source to the extent]of 360,000 gross tons (558^000 d.we), of which about 288,000 gross tons(446,000 d.w.) should accrue in the third year of war.     Negotiations are inprogress for the placing of orders in Canada for the building of 18 cargo tramplof the same tonnage as those ordered in the U.S.A,     These would add 86,000gross tons or 134,000 deadweight to our tonnage ia the third year of war and
108,000 gross tons (167,400 d.w.) by the end wf 1942.      If the rate of British&quot;ouilding of 1^ million gross tons per annum is maintained, our totalreplacements from new building (British, Canadian and U.S.A.) will be 1,624,000gross tons in the third year of war.7.     Even so, if losses (British, Allied and Neutral) continue at the present rate, they would still exceed replacement by approximately 3j million grosstons.Bo   Purchase of Secondhand Foreign Ships.8.

Of the American vessels 56 were acquired from private owners in the UnitedStates, and 36 from the United States Maritime Commission,&apos;     The latter had allVeen cut of service for some considerable time.     An average price of about $27per deadweight ton was bid for the 36 vessels which, with an estimated cost ofabo.;t $20 per ton for reconditioning, etc., will bring their total cost withinthe $50 per ton which is about the average purchase price of the vessels boughtin running order.     The necessary work on the first of these vessels was affected for about $15 per ton, but prices have risen since this work was done.10i    Three tankers totalling 16,328 gross tons (24,975 tons deadweight), have been purchased from private American owners at a cost of $1,841,000-or just over  18 per deadweight ton.     No further purchases of tanker tonnage are contemplated at presents11.    Prior to the invasion of the Netherlands, six coasters, totalling 2,111gross tons (2,727 tons deadweight), were bought from&apos;Netherland owners.Their botal cost in florins was equivalent to  41 per ton d.w.
