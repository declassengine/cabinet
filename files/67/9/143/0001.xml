SECRET.COPY NO.il27th November 1941.WAR CABINET.National Service (No. 2) bill.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and. Minister of Home Security,I dislike the. layout of the National Service Bill (tfo. 2).By providing that such of the Civil Defence Services ashappen for particular reasons to be Civil Defence Forces shallalone be recruited by calling up under the National service act, 1941, (leaving other branches to. be recruited by directionunder Defence Regulation), a difference in methods of recruitmentaffecting individual rights and penalties for disobedience, isperpetuated for reasons which will fail to appeal to allconcerned.The main practical grounds for the distinction between&quot;Service&quot; and &quot;Force&quot;, first introduced by the National service act, 1941, were to prevent men of military age from being called up for civil defence duties which could be done by older men andby women.The result of retaining the distinction in the case ofwomen may be, that in those Civil Defence Services declared tobe &quot;Forces&quot;, younger women than are required will have to be diverted from the A.T.S. into the &quot;Force&quot;, because volunteersin any age groups are not presenting themselves in sufficient numbers and there is no other method of obtaining recruits bycomptalision.If, when the Bill becomes law, the Minister of Labour and national Service is prepared at once to proclaim a sufficientlywide range of age groups to enable postings to be made to fill
existing vacancies in tho National Fire Service and toenable women to be substituted, wherever suitable, for men,I shall be prepared to face the anomalies of the present bill.I must,&quot;however, make two conditions:-*(i) that concurrently with the calling up of women for. the National Fire Service. (i.e. a Civil Defence&apos; . &apos;    . &quot;Force&quot;) he will issue directions under Defence. Regulation 58A to fill vacancies, as required,.in the other Civil Defence Services^(ii) if women arc- not forthcoming in sufficient numbersunder direction procedure, they will be obtainedfrom the faomen in the proclaimed age groups.This can be-done by calling them up to the &quot;Civil.-, Defence Reserve&quot;, a &quot;force&quot; within the meaning:  of the National Service Act, 1941.     These recruitwould then be reposted to the Local Authoritiesrequiring their services.&apos;H.M.HOME OFFICE.27th November 1941.
