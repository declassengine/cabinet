Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.SECRET.W.P. (G) (41) 141.November 27, 1941.WAR CABINET.BUILDING PROGRAMMES.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.THE Lord. President, at my request, has reviewed building programmes and,as a result of his report, the following directions are now issued for the guidanceof all Departments : -A. Limitation.1. (a) The total numbers of insured adult workers in the building industry should be progressively reduced from 920,000 to 792,500 during the first threemonths of 1942.Departments should aim at making this reduction effective very soon afterthe 1st January, 1942.(b) Our general man-power policy assumes that the building industry willbe able to make a further contribution by the end of June 1942. By then the total numbers should be reduced to 770,000; and Departments should aim at gettingdown towards that figure soon after March.(c) Our further objective should be to secure that, after the end of the 1942building season, the numbers employed on new building are reduced to 250,000.The total labour force in the industry should then be about 600,000.Departments should plan their programmes on this basis.(d) Further reductions will be possible on the completion of the programmes for aircraft factories and aerodromes, which in their last phase will be employingabout 150,000 men.[23197]Copy. No.
For the time being Departments should proceed on the basis that by mid-1943the labour force of the industry will be reduced to 500,000.2. Departments whose allocations have been reduced or Avho are nowemploying numbers in excess of their allocations should submit reports to theMinister of Works and Buildings by the 15th December next, showing how they propose to modify their existing programmes in order to get down to their newallocations by the 1st January next.B.-Supervision.3. The existing machinery for scrutinising the Departmental building programmes under the Ministry of Works and Buildings will continue to operate under the authority of the Production Executive. As and when necessary theMinister can consult a military officer in the WTar Cabinet Secretariat in orderto preserve close contact with the Defence Committee. The Minister will beresponsible for determining subject to appeal, in the event of disputes, to theProduction Executive, and if necessary to higher authority; the allocation ofbuilding labour between the Departments within the total laid down from timeto time by the Prime Minister&apos;s Directives.4. The Ministers policy will be based on the following considerations,subject of course to existing ministerial responsibilities : (a) In any clash between the requirements of different projects, the biasshould be to give precedence to those which tend towards theimprovement of the striking power of our forces, e.g., the essentialmunitions of war are of more importance than the A.R.P. : the bomber programme takes precedence over food storage.(b) Even for the most urgent requirements every effort must be made tomake do with existing premises rather than build new factories orextensions.(c) No new factory should be constructed unless it can be shown that thefullest practicable use is being made of all existing capacity, includingdouble-shift working.(d) The standards of construction demanded must be reduced to the lowestefficient level.(e) Departments must exercise the greatest possible economy of building labour, and do all in their power to avoid wasteful use of labour byinsistence on uneconomically early dates of completion.(/) The sites of new factories and extensions must, wherever possible, be sochosen as to reduce the demand for hostels or housing to a minimum.Full use must be made of compulsory billeting and every otheipractical expedient before recourse is had to building.(g) The standards of storage must be the lowest that are consistent withavoiding serious waste.
(h) The  force of  building  labour  available  for maintenance,   air-raidprecautions and air-raid damage must be reduced to the minimum required on the assumption that any stricken area will be able toobtain the maximum aid from all neighbouring sources, includinglabour employed on Government building work.(i) When the present programme for providing static water is completed, anyfurther constructional work in connection with air-raid precautions(including hospitals and shelters) must be limited to that which canbe carried out during lull periods by this minimum maintenanceforce.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,November 27, 1941.
