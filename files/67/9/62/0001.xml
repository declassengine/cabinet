I circulate for the information of the War Cabinetthe attached copy of a memorandum I have prepared forconsideration by the Civil Defence Executive Sub-Committee on Monday next.      As the subject of horseracing in war time is to be raised on the Adjournmenton Wednesday,  2nd July, I feel that the question shouldbe considered by the War Cabinet to whom I propose toreport the conclusions reached by my colleagues on theCivil Defence Executive Sub-Committee.SECRET.W.P.(G)(41)  62.27th June. 1941.W^R    CABINET.HORSE RACING IN W..K TIMEMemorandum by the Home Secretary and minister of Home SecurityiH.M.HOME OFFICE.27th June, 1941.

CTVTL DEFENCE EXECUTIVE SUB-COMMITTEE.&apos;&apos;&apos;&quot; :;:h &apos;&apos;&quot; &apos; HORSE &quot;RACING.Note by the Hone Secretary and minister of Home Security.The policy to be. adopted regarding the holding of racemeetings, was discussed at the Meeting of the Civil DefenceCommittee on the 7th February, 1940,  since when individual programmes submitted by the Jockey Club have been submittedto the&apos;&quot;Civil Defence Executive Sub-Committee for approval.Hitherto, it has been agreed that in view of the. importance of providing some facilities for recreation andof the maintenance of the bloodstock industry, racing shouldbe.allowed,  subject to certain restrictions, to continue ona reduced scale.At the beginning of- the war, the Jockey Club themselvesseverely curtailed their programme.      During 1940 programmesamounting to about 50% of the usual peace-time list were approved subject to the - following restrictions which were imposed as conditions altered;    there should not be more than three meetings in any one week, no meeting should last morethan two days (from mid September this was reduced to one day,- subject to occasional exceptions), and any meeting might be cancelled at a moment&apos;s notice.      In June, 1940,the Jockey Club themselves voluntarily suspended all fixtures.During the current year.programmes&apos;representing about one-third of the normal peace-time list have been approved,subject to the conditions previously imposed and also on theunderstanding that one special train only should be arrangedfrom :each training centre and that it should be open to theRailway - Companies to refuse to carry any horses except thosepresented for carriage by the trains running in accordancewith the programme.      The present position is that a list offixtures has been approved subject to further considerationof the programme from September onwards -when the amount oftransport likely to be available in the Autumn can be moreexactly estimated. .The -following points must be: borne In mind in consideringthe question of permitting horse-racing to continue:-(i) Recre :.tion.The view has -been taken throughout that thereshould be&apos;&quot;reasonable facilities for public recreation.In addition to those who attend race meetings, itmust be remembered that an interest is provided forthousands who are unable to do so.
(ii) Maintenance of the bloodstock industry.Flat-racing is essential for the selection of horses for breeding and for the valuation of horsesfor sale.&apos;    Apart from the export trade, the industry-is in normal times a source of income to thiscountry and it is desirable that it should be givensufficient inducement;to carry on through the&apos;present difficult period.      Although it is difficultto assess the value, of the industry, it is estimated,that the annual value 6&apos;f the export of bloodstockmay amount to something&apos;like  600,000-. .   .(iii) Diversion of inan-aowcr ,It is argued that large numbers of persons areemployed on racing who might be more usefullyengaged, and. that race-meetings are a temptation to war workers to take holidays.      The latterobjection is met so far as possible by -carefulselection of the times and places- at: which meetings&apos;. ,.     may be held.(iv) Transport. &apos;-&apos; !     pIt is &quot;objected that owing to the. crowdsattending face meetings, important transport&apos;is held.up, and.petrol is diverted &quot;to improper uses, and workers returning home are impeded.- Here againdifficulties are met so far as possible by con-sultation.with:local Transport Authorities,  and the fixing&quot;of /meetings to terminate in time for;thecrowds to disperse before the;.workers go home. - I.. have &quot;received ho evidence of serious traffic congestion,  and. it is understood by the&apos;Jockey -Club that the hallways will not provide extra trainsfor race goers. &apos; In1practice, however,  specialtrains have been found to be unavoidable In orderto clear crowds which&apos;have collected at Railwaystations.As regards road transport, 4,677 motor cars and144 charabancs were parked on the Race Course when theNew Derby Stakes were run at Newmarket on the 18thJune.    This meeting, of course, attracted exceptionalcrowds,  and figures for other meetings would no doubt be much lower.    No supplementary petrol coupons are provided either for public service vehicles or for private cars, for attendance at race meetings.(v) Food stuffs.&apos;Race horses consume foodstuffs which would otherwise be fed to cattle or poultry.    The numberof horses in training, however, has been reduced from approximately 11,000 before the Vvar to 2,385last March, and a further reduction to 1,551 willhave taken place by July, by which time the ration of cereals allotted to them will amount to 510 tons
a month - a quantity which is negligible inrelation to.the total supply.(vi)    Security.The degree of dispersion over a racecourseis considerable, and the risk be racegoers of attack from the air is not thought to be greaterthan, for example,  to cinema gours.    InSeptember and October, however, meetings near london were- cancelled owing to danger from air attack,  and have not beui resumed.(vii)    Betting.It may be argued that money which shouldbo invested in National Savings Certificates is spent on betting.    The number of complaintsreceived on this point is small.It is evident that opinion on the question of war-time racing is sharply divided, and that there is considerablefeeling that the expenditure on amusement of efforts and materials which should be reserved for the war effortcannot be justified.      The decision must depend on a balance of the advantages of recreation and of the maintenanceof the industry against the disadvantages of the call on essential transport services and of the temptation to workers to neglect their duties.      It remains for the Committee toconsider whether racing should be continued, subject toconstant review on the present restricted basis, be furtherrestricted, or be discontinued altogether.
