Lz necessary for other reasons that the usual Expiring laws continuance Bill should be passed into law before the end ofthis year, and it must therefore be introduced in the Houseduring the next week or so      The  question has v;eei. raised whether the Disqualification Act ought to ce included in the expiring Laws Bill.       If this  is not done and if no fresh legislation is passed before 6th March,  the Prime Minister!power to issue certificates under the Act will lapse onthat date, though the position of those Members of the Housewho have already been granted certificates will not heaffected,  i. e.   they will still be able to hold the offices in respect of which the certificates were granted and toretain their membership of   the House,The Report of the Select Committee or. Offices orPlaces of Profit under the Crown, which was set up following on the passage of the 1941 Act, has just been published..The Committee divides its recommendations into two,parts,viz.  Part I which covers the position in normal times   and can be studied at greater leisure,  although the SelectCommittee regard it as important that the legislation shouldbe passed before the termination of the present emergency.

Part II of the Committee&apos;s recommendations relates to theresent emergency position,  and it is these recommendationsset out in paragraph 87 of the Report) that need to he considered without undue delay.      The point for immediate decision is whether the present Act should he allowed to expire on 6th March and amending legislation introducedgiving effect to the recommendations of the Select Committee,or whether it should he included in the Expiring laws continuance Bill shortly to he introduced.      If the firstcourse is pursued, urgent consideration must he given tothe Report and drafting of amending legislation, as the gap between the expiry of the present Act and the obtaining of fresh powers must obviously be as short as possible.      Ifthe Act is included in the Expiring Laws Continuance Billmore time will be available for consideration, although, inview of the importance of the recommendations of the SelectCommittee and especially the proposals for amendment of the1941 Act,  it would have to be made clear to the House thatit was being included for the purpose of keeping it aliveuntil amending legislation could be introduced and theearly introduction of such legislation would, have to bepromised.      An argument against the Act being so includedis that the Government might be pressed  to indicate howfar it accepted the recommendations of the Select Committee -though it might not by then have had adequate time to study the matter.      If for this reason it is decided to leave the1941 Act out of the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill and tointroduce fresh legislation early next year,  it wouldprobably not be a matter of serious ineo.aven;;.once if therewere a gap between the expiring of the present Act and theobtaining of fresh powers.The Expiring Laws. Continuance Bill was consideredby the Home Policy Committee on Tuesday last.      An extractfrom their conclusions Is attached.(l)    Took note that the question of adding the House of commons disqualification Act to the schedule of the Bill would be determined by thePrime Minister.(S)   Subject to (l) above approved the expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill,  1941,in the form of the draft annexed with. P. C. (41) 218,   subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may befound necessary or desirable, and authorised the introduction of the Billin the House of Commons with a view toits passage into law before 31st December,1941.
