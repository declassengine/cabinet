Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1941.SECBET.       j Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 13.February 6, 1941.WAR CABINET.RECONSTRUCTION OF TOWN AND COUNTRY.Report by the Lord President of the Council.THE memorandum on the Reconstruction of Town and Country, which was circulated by the Minister of Works and Buildings on the 31st December, 1940(W.P. (G) (40) 321), was referred by the Prime Minister for consideration in thefirst instance by a Committee consisting of -The Lord President- of the Council (Chairman).The Lord Privy Seal.The Minister without Portfolio.The Secretary of State for Scotland.The Minister of Health.The Minister of Works and Buildings.The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.2. After considering the various issues raised by the memoranda circulatedby the Minister of Works and Buildings (W.P. (G) (40) 321), and by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries (W.P. (G) (40) 319), the Committee came to theconclusion that the most practical contribution which they could make wouldbe (a) to define the organisation required to assist the Minister of Works and buildings in carrying out the duties assigned to him in preparing for the physicalreconstruction of town and country after the war, and (6) to indicate generally the scope of the preliminary studies which should be undertaken through this organisation.The Committee have therefore drawn up a practical scheme, which is set outin the Appendix to this Report. This scheme has the support of all the membersof the Committee; and the President of the Board of Trade and the ministers of Agriculture and Transport, who have been taken into consultation, agree thatthe special interests of their Departments are fully safeguarded by the schemewhich has been devised.3.   The main features of the scheme are these : (a) Within the framework of the general study of post-war problems whichis being undertaken by the Minister without Portfolio, the Ministerof Works and Buildings has a special responsibility for physicalreconstruction. He will, therefore, be kept in continuous touch withthe progress of those general studies in so far as they involve, directly or indirectly, any question of building, or physical reconstruction.(6) The immediate task of the Minister of Works and Buildings is toconsider now the methods and machinery required for planning and carrying out the physical reconstruction of town and country, whenthe time comes, in accordance with the policy eventually formulated by the Government on such major issues as the location of industryand the place of agriculture in our national economy.[22208] B
(c) In carrying out these preliminary studies the Minister will work, so faras practicable, through existing Departments and, in suitable cases,through outside experts called in to study particular problems. TheMinister will, however, be responsible for initiating the work, andfor exercising general guidance and supervision.He will have the advice of a body of senior officials representingthe Departments primarily concerned, to assist him in the review and allocation of these preliminary studies.(d) In order to maintain, contact with outside agencies, the Minister willalso appoint a Consultative Panel of independent people of standing,who will command public confidence as -having special experience ofthe main interests affected by national planning. He will consultindividual members of this Panel, as occasion arises, on particular problems on which they are specially qualified to advise.4. This organisation will, in the opinion of the Committee, enable theMinister to make practical progress with the preliminary studies which must beundertaken, in preparation for the physical reconstruction of town and countryafter the war. It will at the same time ensure that the necessary contacts are maintained with the many Departments of State concerned with various aspectsof this problem, and that the special interests of these Departments are fully safaguarded.5. The agreed scheme set out in the Appendix makes no reference to thesubject of the location of industry. Industrial policy involves economic and strategic considerations which go beyond the Minister&apos;s functions : but sinceindustrial location determines the grouping and density of population, it is the basic element in any positive planning of town and country. The committee consider that a study of this subject should be undertaken without delay, underthe direction of the Minister without Portfolio, after consultation with the other ministers concerned and in association with the Minister of Works and Buildings.The primary objects of such a study would be : (i) to formulate provisional conclusions regarding the measure of control over the location of industry whichis likely to be established after the war; (ii) to consider how far these provisional conclusions can be accepted as working hypotheses on which the Departmentsconcerned can base provisional plans for the future; and (iii) to define therespective functions in this field of the Ministry of Works and Buildings and theother Departments concerned.J. A.Privy Council Office, February 6, 1941.
APPENDIX.Organisation for evolving Methods and Machinery for Planning.THE Minister without Portfolio is the War Cabinet Minister in generalcharge of the study of all post-war problems. The Minister of Works and-Buildings has been given a special responsibility for &quot; consulting the departments and organisations concerned with a view to reporting to the Cabinet theappropriate methods and machinery for dealing with the issues involved &quot; inthe physical reconstruction of town and country after the war.The Minister of Works and Buildings will be closely concerned with manypost-war problems which, while turning primarily on wider issues, involvedirectly or indirectly some element of physical reconstruction. arrangements will therefore be made to enable him to keep in close touch with the progress ofthe general studies made under the direction of the Minister without Portfolio,in order that he may be kept informed of the development of all plans for post-war reconstruction which involve any questions of building or physicalreconstruction.2. Within the framework of the general studies conducted under the guidance of the Minister without Portfolio, the Minister of Works and Buildingshas a special responsibility for seeing that all practicable preparations are madefor the physical reconstruction of town and country after the war.Complete planning on a national scale cannot be undertaken during the war.Planning must subserve Government policy on such questions as the place ofagriculture in the national economy, the distribution of industry, the organisationof transport, &amp;c. In all these matters policy must be formulated by the Govern-ment, and for the most part it cannot be finally formulated until we have reachedthe stage at which we can frame an estimate of the:conditions likely to obtain atthe end of the war.The primary task of the Minister of Works and Buildings is, therefore, toconsider now the methods and machinery required for planning and carrying outthe reconstruction of town and country, when the time comes, in accordance withthe policy eventually formulated by the Government on these major issues.This preparatory review of the problem will include a study of the legisla-tion required for the purpose of any national system of planning. It is possiblethat at some later stage in the war an opportunity may arise for introducing legislation on this subject; and it will be advantageous if some legislative proposals can be formulated against such a contingency.It may also be possible to draw up, on an experimental basis, model plans forthe development or redevelopment of certain types of area, particularly urban areas devastated by enemy attack.3. This preliminary study of &quot;methods and machinery&quot; will not pre-judge the decisions which the Government must take subsequently on the major issues of policy; but it must be based on certain assumptions as to the futureattitude of the Government towards the principle of planning. The mainassumptions are : - (i) The Government will be favourably disposed towards the principle of planning, as part of a national policy, and some central planning authority will be required,(ii) In planning the physical reconstruction of town and country, the planning Authority will be able to proceed in the light of a positivepolicy in regard to such matters as agriculture, industrial develop-ment and transport,(iii) The central Government will itself arrange for the planning, by thecentral planning Authority or other Government agency, of servicesand other matters requiring treatment on the broadest national scale.Matters calling for treatment on a Regional basis will be plannedby a Regional Authority. It will be important to maintainunimpaired the character and independence of existing localauthorities, but it will probably be found necessary to readjust theirpresent functions so as to enable certain of their powers to beexercised on a wider basis.[22208]
These assumptions may or may not be fully realised after the war. But, if nopreparatory work were begun until the facts of the post-war situation were known, the Government would find themselves without plans when the warended and events would quickly take the initiative out of their hands. Someprovisional plans must therefore be made in advance on the basis of the bestassumptions that can be made. The Minister of Works and Buildings will takethe assumptions outlined above as the basis for his study of the &quot; methods and machinery&apos;&apos; required to enable a central planning Authority to put into effective operation after the war a policy of planned reconstruction of town and country.4. There are many preparatory enquiries that can profitably be undertaken,but many of these involve issues falling within the sphere of one or more existingDepartments other than the Ministry of Works and Buildings, and almost alltouch at one point or another the work of other Departments. The Minister ofWorks and Buildings will not, therefore, attempt to build up within its own department a large staff of officials who would themselves undertake the study ofall these problems. So far as practicable, he will work through the existingDepartments, though he will remain responsible for the general guidance and supervision of the work and for taking the initiative in arranging for particularparts of the problem to be investigated. The work will be carried out by officials of the Department primarily concerned with the subject, working alone or in collaboration either with officials of other Departments or with outside experts.Full advantage will be taken of the opportunities for consultation and collabora-tion with professional and technical Associations and other representative organisations; and in suitable cases the services of individual outside expertswill be enlisted for the preparation of reports on special problems.5. A suitable organisation must be created to ensure that overlapping isavoided and that full advantage is taken of the knowledge and experienceavailable in the Departments which are familiar with particular aspects of theproblems under review.The Minister of Works and Buildings will therefore appoint an AdvisoryCommittee to assist him in the review and allocation of these preparatory studies.This Committee will consist of senior officials of the Departments concerned, andits permanent composition will be as follows : Treasury.Board of Trade.Ministry of Health.Ministry of Transport.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Department of Agriculture for Scotland.Department of Health for Scotland.Scottish Home DepartmentsA representative of the Minister without Portfolio.The Committee will have power to co-opt, as required, representatives of otherDepartments less vitally concerned (for example, the Home Office, the Ministry ofLabour and the Board of Education).This Advisory Committee will meet under the Chairmanship of a repre-sentative of the Ministry of Works and Buildings.The principal function of the Committee will be to help the Minister ofWorks and Buildings in preparing a scheme of preparatory work to be under-taken before the proposed machinery for planning can be formulated, to advisehim of the inter-relation between parts of this work and enquiries already con-templated or taken in hand by other Departments, and to suggest how the various parts of the work could best be undertaken whether by single Departments, by two or more Departments in collaboration, by outside bodies or individuals, or bya combination of these methods. The Committee will also be able to advise on particular problems affecting Departments which will be thrown up in the courseof the various enquiries initiated by the Ministry.* In Scotland, the Home Department is the Department responsible for general questions relating to local government, while the Health Department is responsible for town and country planning.
6. The Minister will appoint a small staff within his Department to assist them in guiding the studies made on his behalf by officials of other departments and outside agencies, and to keep in touch with the progress which is being made.The head of this staff will be the Chairman of the Advisory Committee, anda junior member of the same staff will act as its Secretary.This staff will be composed in part of Civil Servants, and it will be convenient if some at any rate of its members can be drawn from the Departments which,under existing legislation, have responsibilities in connection with planning and reconstruction. This will facilitate effective liaison between the Departmentsmost closely concerned.   .7. Through this Advisory Committee and the staff working within theDepartment it will be possible to make substantial progress with the preliminaryinvestigations required. In the course of the work, however, questions will arise from time to time which cannot be settled by the officials on the Advisory Com-mittee and call for decision by Ministers. Many of these will be settled at ad hocmeetings between the Minister of Works and Buildings and the departmental minister or Ministers concerned. Where, however, some more general issue is involved, the Minister of Works and Buildings will arrange for it to be brought before one of the Ministerial bodies appointed to assist the Minister without portfolio in his general study of post-war problems.8. Reference has already been made to the desirability of enlisting theservices of outside experts in some of the studies which will have to be undertaken.Where people are brought in from outside to help in this way, it may sometimesbe inadvisable to let it be publicly known that they are giving this assistance. Itis important, however, to make some form of public contact with individuals andsocieties interested in the progress of planning, so that it may be made clear thatthe Minister is carrying out his mandate to consult &quot; the Departments and organisations concerned.&quot;The Minister will, therefore, appoint a Consultative Panel of independentpeople of standing who will command public confidence as having special know-ledge or experience of the main interests affected by any scheme of national planning. The Minister will refer to one or more individual members of thisPanel, as occasion arises, particular problems on which they are specially qualified to advise.9. It is not possible to give a catalogue of all the problems requiring studybefore appropriate machinery can be devised for planning the physical recon-struction of town and country after the war. Examination of one set of problemswill disclose the need for enquiry into others, and the list will grow as the workproceeds. To give some indication, however, of the lines on which this work will develop, a preliminary list is appended of certain initial problems which theMinister will arrange to have investigated by or in consultation with the Depart-ments concerned. (Work on the first three questions mentioned in this list hasalready been put in hand.)Compensation and betterment (cf. paragraph 250 of Report of RoyalCommission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population).Measures necessary to prevent action being taken during the war (e.g., byspeculation in site values) which would prejudice the work of futurereconstruction.Sample surveys of typical areas with a view to assessing the legal andadministrative difficulties likely to arise in connection with the post-warre-development of urban areas devastated by air attack.Review of defects in existing legislation on Town and Country Planning,and of general lines of legislation required for any system of planning on a regional or national basis.Administrative machinery required (national, regional and local) for theoperation of a national planning policy.Modification of existing structure of local government required to facilitateregional or national planning.Economics of different types of urban development and re-development(e.g.t satellite towns or suburban development) including comparative expenditureon the connected public services.Organisation of building trades, and general research into building methods and supply of building materials.
