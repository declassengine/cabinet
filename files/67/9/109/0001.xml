Copy No.5 ()WAR CABINET.REPORT ON VISIT TO NATAL.Note by the Prime Minister.LORD HARLECFFS report on his visit to Natal cannot go without comment.Natal is one of the very few spots in the British Empire where the people are really devoted to the Old Country. They have the New Zealand touch.Considering how the Dutch have practically monopolized the whole Civil Serviceof the Cape Colony, Orange Free State and Transvaal, and how we maintain our influence largely through the outstanding personality of General Smuts, who is72, it is not perhaps such a very bad thing that Natal and the two Rhodesiasshould maintain their characteristic British stand-point. They keep the balance.They constitute communities which the predominant Dutch find it most necessaryto woo. Within this balance the Imperial power is able to afford the protection sonecessary to the native territories. The Zulus, the Basutos, Mashonas, Matabeles,and other races of the Bantu stock are a real responsibility for the mother country. It would be very easy to form a Union bloc on an Afrikander basis which would demand the full control of all native territories and treat them inaccordance with very old-fashioned ideas. Happily the South African problem is more complicated. The maintenance of variety induces a tolerance which the achievement of false symmetry and uniformity would destroy.I have thought a great deal about South Africa since 1899, and have been concerned in some of its most serious convulsions, and I hope that my colleagues will not lend themselves to the judgments which the High Commissioner hasthought fit to record. There ought to be room for many different kinds of people and many different kinds of culture in the British Commonwealth and Empire.[22991]Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET.W.P. (G) (41) 109.October 7, 1941.
Totalitarianism has great attractions to some minds; but he would! be a poorartist who tried to paint a picture by mixing up all the colours in the paint-box.To descend to the practical: Natal is the Ulster of South Africa. But forthe unique authority of General Smuts the Union Government would almost certainly have declared itself neutral. Mr. Pirow was anxious to have 15-inch guns at Simonstown, which could only have been required against British battle-ships. Anyone can see where we should stand to-day with the Mediterraneanclosed if Hertzog had won, and South Africa had gone down the drain likeSouthern Ireland. Still there was always Natal, which would instantly haveseceded from the Union and placed the fine port of Durban at our disposal.This would have been our only salvation at sea, and would have given us alsoindefeasible right of access and entry. Finally, the fear of a Civil War, in whichNatal might appeal for British aid, is one of the strongest factors in maintainingracial peace in South Africa.It is disquieting that the High Commissioner should show himselfunconscious of these realities.W. S. october 7, 1941.
