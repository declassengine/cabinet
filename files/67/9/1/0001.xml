SECRET.December 13, 1940.DRAFT STATEMENT ON WAR AIMS.IIIS Majesty&apos;s Government have for some time past had under consideration the possibility of giving, while still engaged upon the prosecution of the war, a closer definition of their peace aims. It would be premature to try to state theseaims with precision until the main purpose, victory, is achieved, and obviouslymany issues are dependent on the future attitude of a number of Powers whosepolicy is still undecided. Nevertheless, it is right that the Government shouldproclaim without hesitation the principles which will guide them when thepractical task of the post-war settlement can be undertaken.2. We believe that we are truly fighting for our lives, since life to us isworthless if the principles on which it is built are to be destroyed.3.   These principles are, first The religious principle of the absolute value of every human soul;second *the moral principle of respect for personality and conscience;third the social principle of individual liberty, expressed politically throughequal opportunity, justice and the rule of law; and economically throughthe direction of national effort and resources to the abolition of unemployment and the creation of social security; ,fourth &apos;ftthe domestic principle of the sanctity and solidarity of family life, whichis the natural development of the individual.Without these, there is no foundation for human happiness.4.   We therefore assert for all men :The right to think, speak and act freely within the law, and to have freeaccess to the thoughts of others;The right of free association both national and international;The right to live without fear, either of injustice or of want;The right to believe and worship as conscience may dictate.5. These principles flow from the experience gained by mankind fromChristianity and from other religions, and have drawn vitality from the best of human thought through the centuries. These principles are, as we believe,protected by democracy, and that is why we value it. But there are other nations,with different systems of government, not less concerned than ourselves to securethe way of life which these principles reflect. And this is because it is on themaintenance of these standards that rights essential to human life and progress,finally and plainly depend.6. There is no common ground between those who accept these principles andthe Nazis, whose evil theory it is that the State may claim the whole allegianceof man&apos;s body and soul. Truth, conscience, mercy, honour, justice, love; where these clash with what is held to be the overriding interest of the State, they are regarded by Hitler as offences.7. These things have hitherto inspired the civilisation of the Old world and the New. It has sometimes been suggested that the tradition of freedom in Western Europe is a recent growth. But the heroic struggle to assert and preserve the right of popular government, continuously waged since the earlyMiddle Ages, in our own country, as in almost every part Of&apos; Europe, proves[22095]
conclusively how old and how widely rooted is the idea of freedom. america is the creation of men who so valued freedom that they called a new world into being in order to maintain it. The British Commonwealth has grown in an atmosphere of liberty and has developed the principle and practice of self-government. We now see a vandal Germany bent upon exterminating preciousrights and liberties which it has taken centuries to secure. Hitler has destroyed the necessary conditions of international life. The world cannot exist half slaveand half free.8. It is unnecessary to elaborate in detail what Nazism stands for; it isslavery, bodily and spiritual, political and economic. For, as Hitler plans it,the new world would be divided into Germans, who would be the master people(Herrenvolk), and other nations, who would be second-class peoples with rightsand interests subordinated to those of the ruling race. Our enemies talk of theso-called &quot; New Order &quot; to be imposed by Germany on the world. The German&quot; New Order &quot; is an attempt to establish and maintain, by the perversion ofeducation, the banishment of religion and the most ruthless exercise of force,a social system in which culture, individual liberty and a decent standard of lifemust all be sacrificed for the benefit of the State, and in which the State itselfhas become the private property of a small clique, as corrupt, as irresponsible andas merciless as any body of men in the whole long history of tyranny.9. For Europe such a system involves the permanent enslavement of all-peoples and the shackling of their industry and commerce, in order that the Nazimyth of a superior race, for whom all other nations are the divinely appointedserfs, may be perpetuated for all time. This myth is as incompatible with a sense of justice as it is at variance with all reason.10. Moreover, German ambitions do not stop at Europe. Already Hitler isscheming to overrun great tracts of Africa and Asia. He has served warning onthe United States and the other American nations. Across the Straits of Dakarthe invader of Africa can pounce upon Latin America. He would exclude the americas from participation in the trade of Europe, Asia and Africa except on terms laid down by Germany. The nations of the American Continent, a standingchallenge to German domination, would be attacked before they had armed in self-defence. Pacts and treaties with Nazi Germany would be worth no more thanthose that were made by her European victims. Every country in the world is threatened with fraud and violence.11. Our purpose on the contrary is to gain for all nations that liberty whichwe enjoy ourselves. We have already obligations to our allies which we intend to honour. We view with equal sympathy the claims of other peoples now underthe domination of Germany and her allies to the recovery of their political andeconomic freedom. We are prepared by every means in our power to help to bring to an end the anarchy which threatens to submerge civilisation while preserving the individuality of nations within the framework of an ordered society. Fornations, like individuals, can only obtain freedom and security by being preparedto co-operate in a community for mutual defence and economic welfare.12. What form will this community of nations take when victory brings it into being ? We cannot yet draw up a detailed plan for its constitution, since itsform must be one on which the nations agree in free negotiation. But we arealready in a position to proclaim the basis on which this agreement must rest. no party to it will be ambitious to dominate its partners. Every nation, great or small, will have its place and will make its particular contribution. Our own experience in the British Commonwealth of Nations has taught us that it ispossible for nations differing greatly in numbers and wealth, in race and in socialstructure, freely to associate together. What has been- possible for them is not impossible for others, and the British Commonwealth which is by the quality ofits resolution the bastion of world defence to-day, may well, by its geographicaldispersion, become the bridge of greater world unity to-morrow.13. We are prepared to co-operate with any State which shows that itgenuinely seeks the peace and prosperity of the world by loyally observing itsengagements to other States and by ensuring individual.liberty to its own citizens.In many respects Europe must be treated in future as a single whole; Theincreased difficulty, since the last war, in the circulation of labour and goods
across national frontiers has been a major obstacle to an improvement in thestandard of living of the workers of all countries. In the period of reconstruc-tion and in measures for the permanent organisation of the post-war world weshall take every opportunity to promote the common interest in the greatest possible interchange of goods and services. We recognise that we have commonneeds, and that there are problems which can only be solved by common action.14. We have learnt from the experiences of the past that a stable inter-national order should admit of ordered change in the relations between States.Just as individual liberty must have regard to the needs of the community, somust every nation in future remember that it has obligations to the general familyof nations. Rights, whether individual or national, must everywhere be related to the discharge of duties. For the citizen, this will imply service willinglyrendered in one form or another to the State; for the nation, a readiness in both political and economic spheres to consider the welfare of its neighbours.15. The task of reconstruction after the war will be an undertaking far beyond the strength of any single country. Great Britain, for its part, will beprepared to do its utmost, but it is clear that the whole world must join together to bring the world back to health. Above all, if an international system can be built, nations must be prepared to surrender some of their sovereign rights in thecause of. greater unity.. 16. Our present war effort points the way to methods of co-operation bywhich peace may be maintained. Germany is&apos;already opposed by a great inter-national force. In the opposing armies, navies, air fleets and merchant fleets, aremen from every continent in the world. The people of the United States have recognised that we stand between them and grave danger. This common interestin defence is the basis of their recent agreement with us and Canada concerningthe Western Hemisphere. This is an association of which the other Americannations share the benefit, and which we gladly welcome. We hope it will beextended. Just as Canada and the United States have now a joint defence board,it should be possible for other nations to take similar practical steps to the sameend. In all civilised communities, either of individuals or nations, authority must be maintained; but the purpose of that authority must be to protect freedom.17. In the economic field our aim will be prosperity justly shared. even now we are actively preparing to remedy the impoverishment which the war isbringing to the world. We are planning to establish stocks of food and rawmaterials which will be released for the benefit of the invaded countries, as soonas we can be sure that they will not be used for our destruction. We believe thatin the period of convalescence after the world&apos;s devastating sickness we caninaugurate a new era of mutual aid.18. We know that the economic policy of every country reacts on every other country in the world, and we are ready to take part in plans to promote economic co-operation on a world-wide scale. We want to share, as soon as possible, in abold attempt to raise the standards of living throughout the world. Co-operationbetween Governments will be necessary including co-operation in the use ofcontrol of currency exchanges so as to reduce the anarchy in those exchangeswhich has been both the cause and the effect of economic disequilibrium and unemployment, and to restore the foreign exchange system as a serviceable meansof facilitating the exchange of goods for goods.We would, with other nations, press forward with the international organisation of labour standards, and, in the interests of consumers as well asproducers, with the control of raw materials. We believe that, pending thedevelopment of self-government, the spirit of trusteeship should govern theadministration of the colonial territories of all nations.19. These are hopes for the future. So long a.s the war lasts they cannot be fulfilled; but we intend during the war to plan for Britain to prosper, and that not at the expense of other countries, but as one part of a more prosperous world.20. In the economic field at home we can no longer tolerate the existence ofabject poverty and unemployment. If through causes which cannot be overcome,such as the loss of overseas markets, unavoidable unemployment should arise, wemean that this should be not a curse but an opportunity. The man who cannotobtain work is as much a member of the community as the man who can.
21. Just as in order to achieve victory in war we are mobilising all theresources of the nation, so in peace it will be our aim to develop on an orderlyplan both town and countryside not only to produce wealth, but to afford to allthe surroundings in which happy lives may be lived. We shall neglect no opportunity of co-operation with other countries, and we shall allow no vested interests to stand in the way of making Britain in every way worthy of herheroic citizens. Even in the midst of war we shall seek to apply to our national life the principles on which we hope to build peace.22. Already the war has broken down many old barriers and prejudices.The social conscience of the whole people has been aroused. These testing daysare bringing to the front numbers of energetic and daring men and women drawn from all classes and sections of the community, determined that this greatopportunity shall not be missed. The younger generation to-day is virile,imaginative, and alert. &quot;We must use the qualities of youth as well as theexperience of war-time administration to overhaul our economic, social and educational practice, in order to secure for all a reasonable standard of life.23. In this war Great Britain seeks no selfish end. Its immediate cause,as in the last war, was the German breach of a treaty on the one hand, and the fulfilment of a treaty by Great Britain on the other. The ultimate cause was lustfor world power and the concentration of German resources for the single purposeof military conquest. Therefore, it must be Great Britain&apos;s aim in the present war to convince the people of Germany that these traditional ambitions and methods do not pay. One of the greatest tragedies of this time is that for yearsGerman youth has been deliberately and systematically led by its rulers to worshipfalse gods and spurious ideals. The gulf that has thus been fixed between themand the ideals of our own younger generation will take time to bridge. Afterthe war is over, and until they are satisfied of Germany&apos;s co-operation, nationsdetermined to preserve both peace and freedom will therefore have to retainsufficient armed strength to make their will effective. By her own leadership andexample Great Britain must ensure that neither Germany nor any other nationshall revert, or has any reason to revert, to those policies which have plungedEurope into five wars within the last eighty years.24. The people of Great Britain and all those who stand with them in this war are fighting to realise the hopes of millions of men and women throughoutthe world who desire above all things the right for themselves and their children to live their lives in freedom, security and peace.December 13, 1940.
