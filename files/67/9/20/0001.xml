MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. A decision is urgently required as to the incidence of responsibility, asbetween Departments in Whitehall, for the administration of the occupied enemy territories in Africa under present conditions when they are the actual zones of active operations or are likely to be affected by such operations. The territoriesinvolved are Libya, Eritrea, Abyssinia, Italian Somaliland.2. The problems which will arise include the administration of justice,economic policy as to currency, exchange and the reopening of normal tradefacilities, customs and excise, and other matters affecting the general well-being of the civilian population in the territories.Faced with problems of this sort, which fall outside the ordinary scope of a&quot;military officers experience, General Wavell has asked for an expert in colonial administration to be attached to his Staff to advise him in these matters. sir philip Mitchell, formerly Governor of Uganda, and lately Deputy Chairman of theEast African Governors&apos; Conference, has been selected for this appointment, onthe recommendation of the Colonial Office, is now on the Staff of General Wavellat Cairo, and is engaged in collecting a staff of experts in Colonial administration to work under him.3. The War Office have asked General Wavell for his views as to the incidence of responsibility for the administration of the occupied enemy territories. after discussion with Sir Philip Mitchell, General Wavell has replied that, in order toensure that policy does not conflict with military exigencies, the final decision onall matters of policy and form of government must be given by the military commander, i.e. himself. He proposes to appoint military governors to the variousItalian territories (Libya, Eritrea, Italian Somaliland and Abyssinia until handedover to the Emperor) as they are occupied, the occupation following the general principles laid down in Chapter 14 of the Manual of Military Law (based on theHague Convention of 1907), with the necessary modifications on account of colonial conditions. For the purpose of civil administration he will delegateauthority to Sir Philip Mitchell, who will be responsible for its organization and operation in accordance with the policy laid down by General Wavell. Thefinance and accounting of the civil administration will, he proposes, be keptseparate from military finance and accounting. He sees no objection to sir philip Mitchell seeking help from the Colonial Office in details of administrationor personnel.4. An inter-departmental meeting has been held, attended by representativesof the War Office, the Treasury, the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, and the india Office, to discuss the question of the incidence of responsibility for theadministration of the territories. At that meeting it was made clear thatdifferent considerations might apply to different territories. But operational requirements must obviously over-ride all other requirements and, therefore,General WavelPs view fhat he must have the last word on all matters of policyconnected with the civil administration was accepted as sound. Further, it wasagreed that the personnel for the civil administration would naturally to a large
extent be drawn from the Indian, Colonial and Sudan Services. But thequestion still remains to which Department in Whitehall General Wavell is tobe responsible for such matters, and which Department is to be responsible to Parliament for the efficient running of the administration and for its finance and accounting.There appear to be at least 4 possible solutions. The responsibility might be allotted either : (a) to the War Office, or(b) to the Colonial Office, or(c) to the Foreign Office, or(d) in some territories to the Colonial Office and in others to the ForeignOffice. f -None of these solutions is free from objection as no single Department issolely concerned or could carry on the administration without consultation withand guidance from the others. The War Office would have to look to otherDepartments for advice on matters other than operations and military law: theColonial Office might find that normal principles of Colonial administration haveto be subordinated to operational requirements: and the Foreign Office, whilefully conversant with the political aspects, are not normally concerned withadministration. Whichever Department is appointed, the Treasury will have toadvise on currency questions and economic policy.Apart from the practical difficulties, there are two political difficulties towhich attention should be drawn. There is a risk that the allocation of respon-sibility to the Colonial Office might create an impression (however mistaken) thatthe United Kingdom Government has territorial ambitions in these areas and sogive a handle to enemy propaganda, and there are also special considerations inthe case of Abyssinia owing to the position of the Emperor.If either the Colonial Office or the Foreign Office were made wholly responsible,General Wavell would act in a dual capacity ; he would refer to the War Office,as necessary, for instructions on all military matters; on civil matters he would refer to, and receive instructions from the Colonial Office or the Foreign Office.His position would seem to be somewhat analogous to that of the Governors of malta and Gibraltar, who are responsible simultaneously to the Colonial Officeand the War Office. If the responsibility were allotted partly to the ColonialOffice and partly to the Foreign Office, General Wavell would have to reportto three Departments in Whitehall. If the War Office were made whollyresponsible, this difficulty would be avoided and the Colonial Office are strongly of opinion that, while active operations continue, it would not be possible for general wavell to be responsible for civil matters to a Civil Department, and for military matters to the War Office. The acceptance of responsibility by the War office would be without prejudice to whatever might be considered appropriate whenmilitary operations have ceased and only internal security problems remain.At that stage, the question of the transfer of responsibility from the WarOffice to some other Department could be further considered.5. The same kind of problem arose in the last war, particularly in german east Africa, and in the Middle East (Palestine, Syria and Cilicia). In german east Africa in March, 1916, when active operations were still in progress, politicalofficers were drawn from the neighbouring British Colonial territories to assistGeneral Smuts, who was in command of the operations, on questions of civil administration. These officers were not given military rank, but it was made clearthat their powers and authority were derived from General Smuts as Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty&apos;s forces in enemy territory. Responsibility in Whitehallfor the civil administration belonged to the Colonial Office, and any excess ofexpenditure over revenue in the territory was met by the Colonial Office.out of funds provided by the Treasury from the Vote of Credit. A civil administration was not in fact set up until January, 1917. In the Middle East a different system was followed. Military Governors were appointed by General- Allenby, theCommander-in-Chief, and in Whitehall responsibility was formally exercised bythe War Office, expenditure falling against Army Votes.
6. As there are many problems connected with the staffing of the administra-tion and economic policy on which General Wavell has asked for instructions andis entitled to receive very early replies, a decision is urgently required as towhether, while active operations are in progress (a) the War Office should be the Department responsible for the admini-stration of the occupied territories ; or,(6) whether, at this stage, the Colonial Office should be the department responsible, General Wavell remaining responsible to the War office for military matters; or(c) whether the Foreign Office should be responsible for Abyssinia, theColonial Office for Libya, Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, general wavell remaining responsible to the War Office for military matters.7. The Union of South Africa has a political and strategic interest in theadministration of Abyssinia, Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. General Smutsshould no doubt be consulted before any final decision is reached as to themethod of administration.D. M.The War Office,xxth February, 1941(b41/8)   100   2/41   w.o.p.   7052
