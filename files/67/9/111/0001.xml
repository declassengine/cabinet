(G) (41) 111.October 15, 1941.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES  TO RUSSIA AND THE PERSIAN GULF AREA.Note by the Prime Minister.THE Moscow Conference has laid down a programme of supplies to Russia.It remains to give effect to it. This calls for a revision of the present organisation for dealing with these matters. Since some supplies to Russia will go throughthe Persian Gulf area, it is necessary that there should be a single co-ordinatingauthority to deal with supplies (a) to Russia by whatever route, and (b) to thePersian Gulf Area.2. The first essential is to lay down clear lines of departmental responsibility.Departmental Responsibilities.The primary responsibility for all arrangements to improve and administerroad and rail transport in the Persian Gulf Area and for port development inthis area must rest with a single Department, namely, the War Office. To avoidconfusion, all communications on these matters should pass through this singlechannel. The War Office will, no doubt, keep in close touch with the ForeignOffice representative in regard, e.g., to negotiations with the Persian Governmenton transport matters.3. The Ministry of War Transports prime responsibility is, of course, thearrangement and programming of shipments. The Ministry will maintain repre-sentatives in the Persian Gulf and Russian ports, to watch over port arrange-ments, and to improve port administration, in co-operation with the nationalauthorities.[23016]Copy No

The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, in dealing with supplies for Russia, will act as agents for the Ministries of Supply and Food. In runninglocal road transport services, they will be under the control of the local militaryauthorities.6. In order to reduce the number of separate bodies concerned in thesematters, the work hitherto performed by the Section of the Ministry of economic warfare dealing with Russian trade will be transferred to the Ministry ofSupply.Ministerial Executive.7.
