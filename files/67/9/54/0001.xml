Ji*r.AA COPY NOW il,51ST MAY. 1941.WAR CABINET.REFORM OF THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE.Memorandum .,bv the Chancellor of the Exchequer,1, I have read with great interest the Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P.(G)(41) 53,dated 24th May, 1941) and the accompanying Report bySir Malcolm Robertson,     With the Secretary of State&apos;s mainthesis, that a measure of reform is necessary if the diplomatic service is to be able to deal adequately with present and post-war conditions, and that the Service should be recruited from a wider field and be made more representative of the** country as a whole, I am in the fullest agreement;    and I am glad to see that, in order to carry out this desirable reform,he. is prepared to face the prospect of bold and drastic changes in the present system of recruitment and administration,of the Service.      I can assure him of the ready co-operationof my Department in framing a detailed scheme of reform andin carrying into effect whatever measures may finally beagreed upon, even if these should involve some additional burden on the Exchequer.2, I agree with the Secretary of State that it is not necessary to trouble our colleagues with the detailed working-out of the new scheme.      It will be sufficient if the Cabinetauthorise us to instruct our Departments to prepare withoutdelay for our joint approval a detailed scheme of reform,based upon the thesis stated above, which shall take intoaccount Sir Malcolm Robertson&apos;s recommendations.      Theproposed changes cannot well be decided, however, withoutconsidering their probable reactions on the Home Service:here also I recognise that certain changes will be necessaryafter the war in the method of recruitment and training of theAdministrative Class, in order to ensure that the Service,shall be able to discharge the new responsibilities whichwar and post-war conditions impose upon it.     The best methodof dealing with this is already under considerations in theTreasury,3, If the Cabinet agree, this will enable us to dealwith recommendations (ii), (iii) and (iv) in paragraph 5 ofthe Secretary of state&apos;s Memorandum.4, There remains    recommendation (i), &quot;the introductionof a pensions scheme enabling the Secretary of State to retireon a pension proportionate to his service a man of the a?attScof First Secretary or Consul and above, who has proved himself to be unsuitable for the highest posts.&quot;     Our Departments

have already had some correspondence on this subject, in whichthe Treasury made certain proposals with a view to meeting theimmediate situation, which I had hoped would be acceptable tothe Secretary of State.      While I realise that, from causes which I hope lie in the past, a state of things has arisenwhich calls for drastic surgery if the patient is to be curedspeedily, I am most reluctant to see the present crisis used as an occasion for introducing a permanent reform which mayhave unforeseeable, and perhaps serious, consequences on theHome as well as the Diplomatic Service.     Recruitment may wellbe prejudiced.     Moreover, it cannot be expected that theGovernment will be able to enforce a unilateral right torequire premature retirement;    and no one can easily foretellwhat may be the effect on the efficiency of the Service ofan option to the Civil Servant to retire, with the proportionate pension due to him, at an age when he has stillmany years of useful activity before him.      It may well prove that instead of being enabled to get rid of the fpassengers!,the Government will find themselves losing their bestservants.59 Moreover, if the future system of recruitment,training and promotion in the Foreign Service is soundlyconceived and properly carried out (and it will be necessaryso to frame the proposals as to ensure this), special machinery for enforcing premature retirement ought not tobe needed hereafter;    there should be no misfits, or so fewthat they should be capable of being handled otherwise,6* Another objection that I see to the introduction oflegislation now is that civil servants generally (and it is with the Civil Service that I am particularly concerned)would undoubtedly fear that their security is threatened.At a time like this, when the great majority of civilservants are working under severe pressure and are at the sametime painfully conscious of being exposed to a measure ofpublic criticism, I should be sorry to do anything that mightcreate any impression or? insecurity in the Service.7. Moreover, I am not yet convinced that a case forwider statutory powers has been made out.     The Governmentalready possess very considerable powers under variousexisting statutes for dealing with the kind of cases which imagine that the Secretary of State has in mind,      I would suggest therefore that, as a first step, our respectiveadvisers should examine carefully the cases which cause theSecretary of State uneasiness and agree among themselves whichcan be dealt with in one or other of the ways already opento us.     This survey should be completed quite quickly.If there should remain, as I think not unlikely, only a negligible number of intractable cases, I suggest that itwould not be worth while to introduce fresh legislation, withall its attending inconveniences, to deal with these.If necessary, I should be prepared to stretch a point in orderto help the Secretary of State out of his troubles,8. If, however, the residue of such cases proves tobe substantial, and the Secretary of State is satisfied thatfresh statutory powers are necessary, then I would ask thatthey shall be confined, by the terms of the Bill, toemergency powers for the duration of the war only.     Theproposal can then be defended as an exceptional measure todeal with the redundancy of staff created by enemy occupation.

I trust that this proposal will satisfy the Secretary ofStatej    if he agreesr the precise formula to be used in theBill? should one be required, can be settled between ourDepartments.(Intlld.)     K.W.Treasury Chambers031ST MAY, 1941.
