On 21st January, 1941, the Food Policy Committee had&quot;before them a memorandum by the Minister of Food on MilkDistribution and the Perry Report (P.P. (M)(4l) 5) and amemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries on milk (P. P. (M)(4l) 1),2. ,        Qn 15th June- 1940, the Minister of Food appointed aCommittee, of six persons., under the Chairmanship of Lord Perry,to examine the- cost of Milk Distribution in Great Britain.      ThePerry Committee reported on 4th October,      This Report has been published and their recommendations are summarised as follows;-(l) Subject to (7) below,, the allowance of milkdistributors for expenses and profit should be8d, per gallon,(2) This margin should apply uniformly throughout GreatBritain at all seasons of the year.      Effedt shouldbe given to this by an Order or Orders prescribingamaxirnum retail price, and a distributor^ buyingprice, similarly independent of season and locality.(3). No other prescription of prices, whether retail, semi-. retail or wholesale, is desirable or necessary.(4) Distributors should consider the following methodsof reducing costs -(i) a deposit of 3d, on the milk bottle;(ii) utilisation of processing and bottlingfacilities to the maximum advantage;(iii) abolition of the half-pint bottle, andpossibly of the quart bottle;(iv) prepayment instead of credit,(v) exclusion from the milk round of the saleof other goods;(vi) organisation of efficient feeder systems forpram rounds;(vii) further reductions in expenditure... for competitivepurposes, particularly in regard to the shopsmaintained by large urban distributors, whichare not necessary for the distribution of milk.(viii) the restriction of milk deliveries in anydistrict to two organisations, viz., the localco-operative society and a combination ofprivate tr af erSc-1-

For January, February and March, 1941,  there shouldbe a margin in England and Wales of 8d. per gallon in smalltowns and rural districts and of lOd.  per gallon elsewhere,and a margin in all parts of Scotland of 9d.  per gallon.3. The Minister of Food drew the Committeers attention tothe following;considerations;-(a) The organised Milk distributors of England and ^ales..-  considered that no substantial economies in milk   t-:&quot;&apos;,    -distribution were possible and that it was .unjust.,&apos;&apos; &apos;.&apos; to . enforce or their trade a reduced margin whilst &apos;-&quot;.&quot;&apos; ... not adopting the same attitude to the distribution.[&apos;.  V       -       sections of other food tradeso      The Perry Committeehad recommended an 8d. margin without examining theactual costs of distributorso      At present theaverage margin, (including allowance for profit),provided&apos;for milk distribution in England and Wales,ranged from 9-fd0 per gallon in rural areas to l/-:f&amp;.in Londono      In Scotland the margin varied from10 2/31* to 11 l/6d0-(b) Since the Perry Committee completed their investi-gations, there had been a radical change in thecircumstances of milk distribution, owing to thedevelopment of aerial attack upon Great Britain.(c) Milk distributors have been remarkably successful in the special efforts they had made under the new conditions to avoid interruption in the dailydelivery of a food which must be handled promptlyand efficiently to avoid wastage.(d) The willing co-operation of milk distributors withthe Ministry of Food was specially necessary inorder to secure priority of treatment to certainclasses of consumer, at times of milk shortage, andalso in the working of the National Milk Scheme formothers and young children and the Milk-in-Sehoolsschemec(e) No doubt the Psrry Gomrnittee was right in concludingthat in normal circumstances, and subject to extensive:  i.        - reorganisation, milk could be distributed at a con-... .. siderably lower margin than that at present obtaining.  ,.;       int most parts of the country;      but in the present. wholly abnormal conditions it was impossible to -con-template the arbitrary determination of the distributivemargin at 8d, per gallon.      Such action would result inthe Immediate bankruptcy of thousands of distributorsand woixld be fraught with grave risks of complete breakdown of our milk supplies.      If 3uch a breakdownoccurred, neither the Ministry of Food nor the local &apos;Authorities would.be in a&apos;position at the present time-totake over this service^.
* -(f);.Though the primary consideration at the presenttime must he to maintain the distribution of milk to the public-  there existed to-day an opportunitythat should not he missed of securing.a necessaryreform of milk distrihution which had been recommended by many successive Committees of inquiry,,      In particular, producer-retailers werev    ;. the class .of distributors that would he mostseverely affected hy the adoption of the PerryReport, and though in some parts of the countrythey performed an essential function in thepresent system of milk distrihution, as producersthey were relatively inefficient and the industry would benefit hy a reduction in their numbers,&apos;   (at present 60,000), &apos;4. For these reasons the Minister of Pood thought itimpracticable to accept the Perry Report, and he suggested analternative scheme summarised in P. P. (M)(4l) 3 as follows?-.(1) Acceptance of recommendation that some central... organisation should he created to direct theadministration of milk distrihution in thenational Interest, and that the Ministry of Poodshould prepare5 in consultation with interested departments and organisations, detailed plans.(2) No reduction in the.existing distrihution margins(including the maintenance of the increase granted in respect of additional war costs) on milkdelivered at the home. - ,(3) Vvithdrawal of the minim-am.retail., price with effect from 1st April, &quot;1941, so that-free competition will... &quot;bring the margin to i&apos;ts; economic levels :-&apos; (Maximum.., retail&apos; prices&apos;will be maintained.to protect thea consumer )0 \ ;:(4) Prescription of a reduced retail price for milk soldover the counter (or collected by the consumer fromthe farm) such that the, distrihution margin on such-milk does not exceed 8d&apos;0 per .gallon. .(5) Increase in the margin allowed under, the Milk-in-Schools Scheme from 8d0  to 9d. per gallon, asfrom the 1st February/...      ,.(6) Rejection of the recommendation-for a uniform marginand a Uniform retail price, and the consequentrejection of - .:(a) the application of the Scottish milk marketing Board for the &quot;equalisationof the return to Scottish producers tothe higher, return at present received,hy Engli sh produc ers;(h) the application for a uniform nationalpool price for the whole of England and- &quot;l If/ales instead of separate regional poolprices.
&quot;&apos;;&apos;p:.:&apos;\ &apos;. &apos;&apos;^e:se. proposals represent a compromise between the^-^$ $gutf a^ce^ance or rejection of the Perry Report.   - The^a&apos;borx&apos;t&apos;jon- of .mxnimum retail prices would release the forcesof competition and lead? though not as a result of direct government action, to the liquidation of inefficient or&quot;redundant distributors.      Under these conditions the ministry would&apos;be in a strong position to follow up certain constructive   -prpp.qs.als recently; put forward by the Trade and to prepare aCbmpr^ensive. scheme for the reorganisation of the MilkDistributive^ Industry.      A central organisation should be&quot;&quot;created&apos; wi&apos;th&quot;full.powers which would discharge, in relation&apos;to milk distributionj functions analogous to those of the milk marketing Board in relation to production.6.  .. ,   ... To. prescribe a.reduced retail price for milk sold overf the&apos;counter would establish the principal of the 8d. marginrecb^ended by the Perry.Report and would enable numbers of &apos;the public, who are prepared to collect their milk, to obtainit at a lower price,   ; On the other hand, it might encourage the sale of milk.through. large shops (which wos criticised inthe Perry Report) and by reducing the turnover of ordinarydistributors it might-tend to make milk dear in the home.The view of the Committee ;was? however, that the proposal should at any rate be .retained for bargaining purposes in negotiation with the Trade,7. Some members of the Committee favoured acceptance ofthe recommendation of the Perry Report for the enforcedreduction of the distribution margin to 8d. per gallon,pointing out that the problem of milk distribution had beenthe subject of public discussion for many years and thatsuggestions for reform had always broken down on theopposition of political and trade interests, particularly those of the producer retailer.      The political opposition which would be aroused if the Perry Report was acceptedshould be faced from whatever quarter it might come.      In &apos;the opinion of the Secretary of State for Scotland,  theproposal of the Minister of Pood to withdraw the minimumretail&apos;,price might have serious effects on the stability of the milk industry in Scotland,- &apos;  &apos;      *Other members of the Committee doubted whether the setting up of a central distributing organisation would suffice to secure rapid and effective action in reorganisingthe trade.     Apprehension was also expressed regarding theeffect of restricting the entry of new retailers into thetrade which would confer a monopoly upon existing retailers.8. While appreciating the objections to the proposals ofthe Minister of Pood, the Committee agreed with the minister that in present circumstances acceptance in toto of thePerry Report was impracticable, and that his proposalsrepresented the only feasible alternative.    If these proposals were to be adopted, however, the Committee considered it essentialthat the&apos;proposal summarised in. 4 (l) above should be vigorouslypursued and that the central organisation which it was proposedto create, to direct the administration of milk distribution shouldbe an effective body armed with all necessary powers.9. The Committee recommend the. War Cabinet to accept theMinister&apos;s proposals as summarised in,paragraph&apos;4 above.Signed on behalf of the committee. R.  ATTLEE.GREAT GEORGE STREET,    S. W.
