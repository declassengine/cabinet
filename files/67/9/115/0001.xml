Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) &quot;(M) 115.October 20, 1941.WAR CABINET.MINISTRY OF SUPPLY LABOUR NEEDS.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.IX order to carry out its present production programme the Ministry ofSupply needs to recruit an additional 160.000 men and 200.000 women by June1942. &apos;The factories, the&apos; machine tools and the raw materials are available. Butlack of labour is holding up production. For example, the output of -.303ammunition is being delayed because we have been forced to transfer labour employed thereon to the making of 20-mm. ammunition.Much could be done to ease the labour situation by the more rapid recruitment of women.Up to the end of August 1941 two million women had been registered. Ofthese 500.000 had been interviewed. But only 87,000 had been put to work in theWomen&apos;&quot;s Auxiliary Services or on munitions. It is essential that therate of recruitment should be increased to an extent far beyond anything yetcontemplated.There should be more expedition and ruthlessness in combing out women from non-essential occupations. Too many are still allowed to stay in kiosks andin the distributive trades generally, which still absorb over one million women.Women set free by the concentration of industries are being lost to war pro-duction. For example, out of 20,000 women set free by the concentration of thecotton industry, only 10,000 have gone into munitions. Steps should be taken to recall these women for work in the war factories, and to prevent a similar leakagein other concentrated industries.Only by utilising to the full the woman-power of the country can the fulfil-ment of the Ministrv of Supply programme be contemplated.B.October 20, 1941.[23043]
