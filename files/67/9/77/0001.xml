The departmental reports are appended.2. The reports have been examined by the Civil Defence Committee and action initiated on a number of points.3. The Civil Defence Committee has agreed that Departments should beasked to submit a progress report at the end of August.4. The main outstanding questions and the action which is being taken inrespect of them are summarised below.Preparations for dealing with effects of heavy air raids.5. As a result of the work which has been done to improve the generalorganisation, we should be in a much better position than last winter to marshalour resources effectively to deal with the consequences of heavy raiding (Section A,paragraph 13). In view of the many interests affected, detailed plans must bemade in advance; and frequent inspections and exercises will be held on a widerscale than heretofore (Section A, paragraph 23).6. The special problem of the ports calls for separate examination(Section A, paragraph 11), and the Ministry of War Transport have askedRegional Port Directors to report on the measures which have been taken. when these reports are received, the position at the ports will be reviewed by the ministries of War Transport, Home Security and Labour. The Import Executive,Petroleum Department, Ministries of Food and Supply and the Health Depart-ments will be consulted as necessary.Shelter Programme.7. (a) The present shelter programme, which provides for the period up tothe end of October, may be curtailed by shortage of labour and materials(Section A, paragraph 29). The Ministry of Home Security, the Ministry ofLabour, the Ministry of Works and Buildings and the Health Departments are examining the position; but the shortage is in large measure due to the claims of more urgent work and cannot be wholly avoided.(6) The provision of amenities (ventilation, lighting, sanitation, &amp;c.) inshelters outside the London area is not so far advanced as in London, but thenecessary measures are being taken to accelerate action (Section A, paragraph 41).(c) The delivery of bunks for Anderson shelters is behindhand, due partly to shortage of galvanising facilities, and partly to shortage of steel and timber(Section A, paragraph 42).[22735a]
Lighting Restrictions.8. (a) A new standard of exterior lighting to be brought into operationafter the &apos;&apos; Purple &apos;&apos; warnings is being developed, so as to enable work to continueup to the &quot;Alarm&quot; (Section A, paragraphs 44-45). This is of especialimportance at docks. A scheme has been worked out for Glasgow Docks and thework at other ports will be expedited; also at railway marshalling yards, shiprepairing yards, &amp;c. (Section D, paragraphs 11 (v) and 19 (ii) ).(b) The screening of industrial glare is almost completed (Section A,paragraph 46).(c) Another matter of some importance is the work being done by the ministries of War Transport and Home Security to achieve uniformity of practice in the lighting of all permanent road obstructions (Section D, paragraph 14). Itlinks up with the work which is being carried out by the Ministry of war transport on the improvement of aids to movement in the streets (Section D,paragraph 12).Smoke Protection and Camoiofiage.9. The provision of smoke protection is retarded by shortages of labour and oil (Section A, paragraph 47). Camouflage is making satisfactory progress(Section A, paragraph 48).Welfare Civil Defence personnel.10. A good deal has been done in the last, six months in regard to basic pay, uniforms, overcoats and boots, sick leave facilities and amenities generally.There is, however, still room for improvement in the working conditions of civil defence personnel, particularly in the furnishing and protection of depots andin feeding arrangements (Section A, paragraph 54). The necessary action isbeing taken.Fire Prevention.11. This subject (Section A, paragraphs 67-75) is under urgent examinationat the present time and, after a difficult stage, progress is now being made. Theenquiry referred to in paragraph 6 above will give special attention to fire preven-tion arrangements in ports.Equipment and Appliances.12. Almost every Department refers to shortages on some of the equipment required for their services.   The main items appear to be : (i) Bunks   for   shelters   and   civil   defence   personnel   (Section   A,paragraph 42);(ii) Equipment for civil defence and fire fighting reinforcement camps(Section A, paragraph 56);(iii) Fire  appliances   for  public  brigades  and   essential   undertakings(Section A, paragraph 61), fire hose (paragraph 62), steel piping for emergency water supplies (paragraph 63), and fire boats(paragraph 64);(iv) Furniture and equipment  for additional rest centres  (Section  C,paragraph 2);(v) Stand-by pumping plant for water undertakings (Section C, para-graph 47);(vi) Supply of clothes for homeless persons (Section F, paragraphs 8 and 9).Supplementary and Static Water Supplies.13. Hitherto, the local authorities have not, in some parts of the country,shown much initiative on this subject, but the new national organisation of the fire brigades will assist in getting this work completed with greater speed. Themain problems are possible shortages of labour and materials, and a considerable quantity of steel and of builders, excavators and labourers will be needed if thenecessary progress is to be made before the autumn (Section A, paragraph 65).Temporary Hostel Programme.14. A good deal has already been done, and it is hoped to provide temporaryhostel accommodation for 50.000 persons before the winter, with accommodation for 200,000 as the ultimate objective (Section C, paragraph 3).
Emergency Evacuation Joint Committees of Local Authorities.15. Progress is being made in the appointment of Joint Committees oflocal authorities where several reception areas serve one large target area(Section C, paragraph 15).Billeting and Evacuation.16. (a) No points of serious moment seem to arise on the main evacuationschemes for the removal of priority classes from densely populated urban areasliable to heavy bombing (Section C, paragraph 19 et seq.).(b) The Ministry of Health refer, however, to difficulties which they are finding in accommodating unaccompanied children under five years of age. It isnecessary at present, because of limitations of suitable accommodation, equipment and staffing, to restrict the acceptance of unaccompanied children under five for removal to safer areas (Section C. paragraph 29). Every effort is being made toincrease the number of available residential nurseries, but the supply of suitable accommodation is limited and staffing difficult.(c) There are also difficulties in respect of the housing of transferred munition workers in certain areas. This matter has been referred to the Housing (war requirements) Committee by a conference of Ministers presided over by the lord president (Section C, paragraph 37).Staggering of Working Hours.17. The pressure on transport facilities at peak hours in winter eveningsshould be reduced. The main solution must lie along the lines of a more generalstaggering of working hours (Section D, paragraph 1). The Ministry of war transport are proposing to take action on the same lines as last year, but overa wider field.Restoration of Shopping Facilities.18. (a) The Board of Trade are working out with the Ministry of works and the Ministry of Health a scheme for the pre-fabrication of shopping boothswhich could be sent at once to bombed towns where air attack caused a shortageof retail shops (Section F, paragraphs 6 and 7).(b) The Ministry of Food are also preparing plans in vulnerable areas for temporary shopping centres and travelling shops (Section K, paragraph 7).Ministry of Works&apos; Depots.19. The Ministry of Works are building up emergency stocks of material in target towns for use in first-aid repairs to damaged houses and buildings(Section G).Food.20. The Ministry of Food are making plans to establish in every FoodDivision one or more dumps of unrationed commodities to be drawn upon as required to replace damaged stocks in vulnerable areas. It is hoped that thesedumps may be in operation by the 1st September (Section K, paragraph 4).21. The Ministry of Food are working out with local authorities schemesfor the treatment of food which is believed to have been contaminated by gas.Two-thirds of the schemes have been completed (Section K, paragraph 13).Electricity Commission.Assistance Board.Ministry of Pensions.General Post Office. 1Board of Education and Scottish Education Department.Ministry of Aircraft Production.Petroleum Department.22. The measures being taken by these Departments to meet the possible consequences of winter air attacks are outlined in their memoranda and call forno special comment (Appendices E, I, J. L, M, N and P).
23. Various aspects of the coal problem are under consideration by theLord Presidents Committee (Appendix O).Publicity.24. The Ministry of Information is making progress with the appointmentof Emergency Information Officers in target areas who would assist in the dissemination of information and instructions to the public (Section C, para-graph 12).25. The various departmental reports contain references to matters on which general publicity is desirable; and a concerted programme will be prepared bythe appropriate Inter-Departmental Committee. The Committee will relate its work to the publicity necessary on certain aspects of invasion preparations.Manpower.26. Many Departments refer to the difficulty of completing their programmes due to manpower difficulties. These shortages are of two kinds : (a) There is a general shortage of all classes of building and civil engineeringlabour (Section A, paragraphs 29, 55 and 66, Section H, paragraph 1). Thescheme under consideration by the Ministry of Works for the registration of allcontractors should, however, facilitate the diversion of private contractors andtheir labour to essential work (Section H, paragraph 6). (b) Secondly, thefollowing problems are being examined in conjunction with the Ministry ofLabour : (i) The manpower position in the various Civil Defence Services, particu-larly the Fire Service, is causing anxiety (Section A, paragraph 53and paragraphs 58-59).(ii) Local authorities have been hard hit by the calling up of experiencedpersonnel and are dependent on deferment for selected men in orderto maintain a minimum service.(iii) The release of more regular policemen from the Army seems to benecessary, especially in view of the calls on the police in connexionwith air raids and their special duties in the event of invasion. Formany of these responsible duties men well trained in police work arerequired (Section C, paragraph 5).(iv) The same difficulties as under (iii) arise in the case of skilled employees of gas undertakings (Section F, paragraph 4).A accommodation.27. Several Departments report difficulties in finding accommodation for new services and requirements. The position could be eased somewhat if theMilitary and Air Force authorities were prepared in cases of need temporarilyto place at the disposal of the civil authorities accommodation earmarked forsome future Service requirement. This is being taken up with the service departments.H. M.Home Office,August 15, 1941.

Section A.-MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTRY OF HOME SECURITY.The War Situation from the Civil Defence Aspect.WE must make our plans to meet the worst situation that could arise, and since all German preparations for an attack on Great Britain must be assumed to be complete, the switch-over from Russia to an attack on this country mightwell be very quick.The improvement in our night defences is continuing, but we must prepare for worse air attacks than we have yet known. Heavier bombs than hitherto maybe used.2. We should be prepared for renewed attack on the British Isles at thelatest by the middle of September, as well as continued heavy bombardment onthe West Coast ports.If invasion is postponed until the Spring the centres of the aircraft industry are as likely as the ports to be heavily bombed; but whenever invasion is to takeplace, its immediate prelude will be attacks on the aerodromes, either by air bombardment or by air-borne troops.It will be seen that in reviewing the Civil Defence arrangements there is nogeographical limitation to the enemy&apos;s selection of targets for air or air-borneattack; since our aerodromes and aircraft factories are spread over the countrywe must expect these attacks to be widespread and not necessarily restricted to theEast and South coast areas. Special attention must, however, be given to theposition of the ports.The position of the ports.3. The enemy&apos;s attacks on the West Coast ports during the winter andspring have shown the importance he attaches to the bombing of ports as part ofhis general blockade policy. It is possible that he will develop the large-scalebombing of these ports as soon as his other commitments allow.4. The enemy&apos;s aim in the past appears to have been to restrict the workingof the ports more by attacks on the homes of the dockers, on the general life ofthe towns and on railway communications serving the docks, than by accuratebombing of the port itself. At the same time, he has been successful in destroyingmany warehouses and large stocks by fire, and in immobilising railway communica-tions, and thus impeding the clearance of goods.5. Dispersal of factories from such centres as Coventry can do much to limit the effectiveness of heavy raids on the nation&apos;s war effort. Docks cannotbe so dispersed. Moreover, we are more dependent on the effective working ofsuch ports as Liverpool, Avonmouth and Glasgow than on any one industrialcentre, since dock facilities are limited and are not capable of expansion.6. It is the concern of the active defences to limit attacks on the ports, butpassive defence measures can do much to limit the effect of bombing on the workingof the ports. Our primary concern must be to safeguard the lives and welfare ofthe port workers. The working of the ports largely depends on the supply of skilled and efficient labour, and the vital importance of the working of the docksin the life of the community justifies us in treating them as a special category.All steps must be taken to.ensure that port workers are not dispersed by thedestruction of their homes and by haphazard evacuation. They must be protectedin or near their homes by the provision of shelter; also arrangements must be madefor the homeless to be placed in billets from which they can easily be conveyed totheir work. Urgent action is being taken for the construction of camps for thehomeless at certain places, and if enemy bombing appears likely to develop indock areas on a vast scale it may be necessary to extend these plans to other areas.7. Fire will remain a great source of danger in the docks, but the danger is being met to a great extent by movement of stocks and by fire-fighting measures.The problem of moving stocks from the docks is a complex one, depending on the availability of labour, transport and storage space, but it is better that stocks
should be moved at a considerable expenditure of effort than that they should be destroyed by fire.Fire-prevention in docks is again a difficult problem. Experience shows thatthe prompt extinction of incendiary bombs and the use of decoys can lead to the diversion of a major attack.8. The efficiency of the fire brigades and their equipment in the chief portsmust receive special attention, and they should receive high priority in theallocation of man-power and supplies.9. The urgency of the maintenance of communications from the ports isclear. Not only does the interruption of communication affect the distribution ofsupplies throughout the country, but also it leads to the accumulation of stocks in the warehouses and an aggravation of the fire risks in the docks. The clearance of roads, the disposal of unexploded bombs, and the repair of railways in these areas are of the greatest importance, and high priority should be accorded to this work. The disposition of Bomb Disposal Units and repair gangs should be suchas to enable communications to be restored with the minimum delay.10. The Import Executive have called attention to the need for special measures to restore telephone communications at ports after a raid. The regional commissioner for the North-Western Region has already set up a Communi-cations Committee on Merseyside and for the Manchester area to study this problem and make plans, and similar steps will be taken in other target areas.11. In view of the importance of maintaining the work in the Ports, all aspects of Civil Defence on Clydeside, Merseyside, the Bristol Channel, Hull andpossibly other ports, should be the subject of a special review by the Departmentsconcerned.Co-ordination of Work after heavy air raids under osgis of regional commissioners.12.   Experience of the severe raids of last winter showed that the local-arrangements for repair and rehabilitation were not always adequately organised.In many cases the local authority machine in target areas did not respondsufficiently quickly to the heavy calls made upon it.13. In a series of circulars issued early this year, Regional Commissionerswere asked to secure that the necessary organisations were set up to ensure that,after heavy air attacks, the available resources for welfare, repair and recon-struction were fully and promptly employed. The occasion of the present reviewhas been taken to ask Regional Commissioners for a progress report, and theyhave expressed themselves as satisfied with the arrangements which have been worked out.Regional Commissioners Powers.14. An exhaustive examination of the question whether regional commissioners require further powers over regional representatives ofGovernment Departments or local authorities has resulted in the decision ofMinisters that there is no satisfactory alternative to the present position.15. An amendment of Defence Regulations 54b has, however, been made which gives Ministers full power to issue instructions to local authorities on matters falling within the purview of local authorities, and this power has beendelegated to Regional Commissioners, though Commissioners will, save in grave emergency, be expected to consult the Minister concerned before using the power.A further number of deputy Regional Commissioners has been appointed, sothat there are now two deputies in most Regions. The intention is that onedeputy should be responsible for the various civil defence services, including fire prevention, and the other for the measures needed to deal with the effects of heavy raids.A dvanced Regional Headquarters.16. The usual procedure after a heavy air attack is that the regional commissioner or his Deputy will set up advanced regional headquarters In or
near the area affected and will confer with the local authority about the need foroutside help and for the establishment of emergency control arrangements. Itwill usually be necessary for the Commissioner to arrange for a local conference to be held on the morning following the raid, at which the Regional Commissioner,local authority and others concerned can review the situation. &apos;17. The appointments which are being made of Deputy Commissionerswith special responsibilities for work after a heavy air attack will assist in thisconnection.Local Authority Organisation.18. Regional Commissioners were asked in February last to arrange ineach target area for the Emergency Committee of the local authority to reviewits plans in consultation with the representatives of Government departments and the authorities responsible for emergency repairs and industrial restoration.The appointment of a local Emergency Repairs Committee was recommended,to determine priorities among repair works and to co-ordinate them.Regions have adopted rather different policies in this matter. Some have arranged for local authorities in target areas to appoint Emergency RepairsCommittees, as was recommended by the Ministry; in other areas the regional commissioner has appointed the local Emergency Repairs Committee. Oneregion has appointed a regional committee.19. The occasion of the amendment of Defence Regulation 54b was takento ask local authorities to give full power to their Emergency Committee to acton behalf of the authority in respect, not only of matters falling within the definition of civil defence, but also of all measures necessary to deal with theconsequences of a heavy raid.Transport.20. The Ministry of Home Security recommended the appointment ofEmergency Transport Committees in target areas to co-ordinate transportrequirements after a heavy raid.Arrangements are now being completed throughout the country to deal withthis matter, though some Regions have preferred to appoint a regional ratherthan local committees.Communications.21. In view of the experience on Merseyside, Regional Commissioners arebeing asked to set up a Communications Committee in selected areas to examinethe communications system and make plans to meet a period of severe dislocation.Mutual Assistance.22. Regional Commissioners have taken steps to ensure that mutual assistance pacts are completed and kept up to date among local authorities andpublic utility undertakings for help by way of labour and materials in carryingout their duties under conditions of heavy air attack.Exercises.23. In several Regions, exercises in the problems arising from heavy air attack have been held on quite a large scale. Regions have been told to see thatthese exercises are carried out all over the country.Salvage.24. Improved arrangements have been made for the salvage of furniture.As regards the salvage of commodities, the Ministry of Food and the Ministryof Supply have developed a salvage organisation to look after their interests (food and raw materials). Further steps are needed to ensure prompt action in the ports and for the recovery of privately owned goods in the national interest. Thequestion is under review by the Lord President.
.    \    &apos; Air Raid Shelter;Introduction.25; Policy was reviewed in February last in the light of experience of theconditions arising from dormitory use and of the expectation of the institution of a system of rationing of labour and materials.   It was decided that (a) The country should be divided into areas of first, second and thirdimportance from the vulnerability view point of view (&quot;A,&quot; &quot;B&quot;and &quot; C &quot; areas).(6) The main effort should be concentrated on &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B&quot; areas.(c) In all areas, improvement of existing shelter should be given priority over new construction.(d) Efforts must be made to secure the largest possible reserve of shelter in steel framed and reinforced concrete buildings and to obtain thegreater use by night of shelter in factories working day shifts only.(e) Measures to reduce damp and cold must be pressed on.(/) More effective steps must be taken to deal with flooded Anderson Shelters.(g) The production of an indoor steel table shelter must be accelerated.(h) The limit of eligibility for free shelter should be raised from  250 to 350.(i) Each Region should select a Regional Shelter Officer to exercise admini-. strative functions under the Principal Officer in regard to shelter inthe Region.26. Effect was given to decisions (a), (h) and (i) and on the 27th March,Regions were given a modified objective framed so as to have regard to theavailable resources of labour and materials and were asked to submit proposalsfor meeting the deficiency required to be made good to achieve that objective.27. Towards the end of April it transpired as the result of negotiations between the Ministry of Home Security and the Ministry of Works and Buildingsthat work to the total value of  12,000,000 representing a labour force of 40,000building employees was the maximum allocation which the Ministry could expectfor the six months then commencing. This total figure was provisionally allocatedbetween the Regions and they were asked in their turn to make allocations to theirconstituent local authorities on the basis that &quot; A &quot; areas would receive doublethat of &quot;B&quot; areas of similar size and that the waterproofing of Andersonshelters, the waterproofing and strengthening of trendh shelters, and the strengthening and sub-division of basement shelters should receive one-twelfth ofthe total resources, the replacement, strengthening, lighting and heating of surfaceshelters one-half, and new works, including work then under construction, one-quarter. Regions were instructed that, pending formal agreement with theMinistry of Works and Buildings on allocations of labour and materials, commit-ments could be entered into on the basis of the provisional allocation up to theend of June.28. Some adjustment of the proposals made by Regions has been necessaryto fit them into the framework of the total allocation to the Ministry, but agree-ment with the Ministry of Works and Buildings has now been reached and the regions have been notified accordingly.29. Regions are being urged to proceed as vigorously as possible within thelimits of the allocations of cash value, labour and materials finally made to them,but the current programme and any which may be devised at the end of the presentperiod of six months are conditioned by the situation as regards the availability of materials and labour, more particularly the latter. KClosing of unsatisfactory shelters : strengthening of existing shelters.30. Instructions were given at the end of March that all unsatisfactoryshelters built at the time of the cement shortage in lime mortar ungauged withcement should be closed, except those certified as satisfactory, and that all sheltersbuilt with lime cement mortar should be examined and defective ones closed.31. A new Defence Regulation enabling the closing of public shelters whichare unsuitable and incapable of being made suitable,for the purpose (e.g., railwayarches) was obtained at the end of May.
32. Technical advice on shelter improvement was issued at the end of April,and since then experiments have been carried out with a view to determining thebest method of strengthening existing surface shelters. In these experiments a250-kilogramme bomb buried with its centre of mass 12 feet 6 inches below groundlevel was exploded 15 feet from brick shelters built in normal construction towhich various types of strengthening had been applied. These experimentsshowed that the application of a 4^-inch brick or concrete skin keyed into theoriginal shelter walls, together with the reinforcement of the roof by the additionof a 3-inch layer of concrete, produced a structure which moved as a solid box but did not disintegrate when the explosion occurred.33. Instructions for the strengthening of existing surface shelters by themethods concerned have been issued together with appropriate drawings. this type of strengthening work has the advantage that it can be carried out withoutinterfering with the fitting up of the inside of the shelter or with occupancy ofthe structure.New steel indoor table shelter.34. Distribution of the new steel indoor table shelter commenced at the endof March, and so far nearly 298,000 shelters have been allocated. Distribution was originally limited to &quot; A &quot; areas, but as increased supplies made it possible, thescope of distribution has been widened to include &quot; J3 &quot; areas specially recom-mended by regional authorities. Present production is at the rate of 20,000 aweek.Protection of Anderson shelters from damp.35. On the 30th April a consolidating circular was sent to local authoritiesindicating in detail the methods considered likely, in the light of experience, tobe found satisfactory in dealing with flooded Anderson shelters and those withinsufficient covering, and instructing local authorities to study the local positionafresh and to take steps in consultation with the regional authorities for curingthe mischief as quickly as possible.Publicity.36. A new pamphlet, Shelter at Home, bringing up to date the information given in the earlier pamphlet Your Home as an Air Raid Shelter, so far as concerns indoor shelters, was placed on sale and issued to local authorities in mid-June.37. A local publicity campaign for the purpose of popularising the newindoor table shelter, more particularly for purchase by persons over the incomelimit for free provision, is in hand. Publicity material for a campaign to remove the prejudice against surface shelter is prepared and the campaign will be launched in a few weeks&apos; time, as the high summer is not regarded as the bestperiod psychologically for such an effort.Broadcasts on air raid shelter were made on the 11th February, the 6th june and the 12th June.New Tube Shelter.38. Work has been proceeding steadily since last December on the exoava-tion nf these shelters and every effort is being made to have the maximum possibleaccommodation available by the onset of winter.Progress in Shelter Amenities.39. The responsibility for the provision of amenities and the maintenanceof health in shelters rests with the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland. All Regions have been pressed to deal with the provision of shelteramenities as a matter of urgency before the winter. They have been urged to seethat sanitation, ventilation, heating and lighting are satisfactory and, where necessary, to provide feeding facilities, medical aid posts and welfare services.They have also been told to take steps to see that bunks are provided forAnderson shelters and for all public shelters used or likely to be used for dormitorypurposes.
[22735]c40. In London great progress has been made in the provision of amenities.Special attention is. now being given to the completion of the bunking programme.Bunks for over 700,000 persons in public and 630,000 in Anderson shelters havealready been installed. Further supplies are on order. 260 Medical Aid Postshave been set up, some of which have been placed on a care and maintenancebasis owing to decrease in users of the shelters. Provision of sanitary conveniencesis almost complete and all the necessary canteens have been installed. A specialtechnical survey of badly ventilated shelters is now in progress. Shelter WelfareCouncils have been set up in 20 Boroughs and 8 more are in process of formation,and welfare workers have been appointed in a number of Boroughs. A regularinspection of all shelters is carried out continuously.Provincial Regions, Wales, and Scotland.41. The position in Scotland, Wales, and the Provinces as regards amenitiesis known to be below the London standard. The explanation is that in some regionsthe incidence of enemy attack has not been such as to lead to the continuousdormitory use of shelters and that many local authorities have been afraid that provision of amenities might encourage people to congregate in public sheltersin vulnerable areas. All Regional Commissioners have, however, now been impressed with the necessity for effective action to provide amenities for allpeople who may want to sleep in public shelters in the event of more general orintensive raiding. Arrangements have been made for a systematic survey byInspectors of the Health Departments. The Regional Commissioners will take action with local authorities to see that defects discovered are remedied. a monthly progress report has now been called for and the first returns are dueat the beginning of August. In target areas bunking, with priority for domesticshelters, is now taking place. All Regions have been surveyed by Ministry ofFood Shelter Feeding Officers with a view to the designation of areas whereprovision of canteens is desired. Arrangements are in hand for medical aid posts and the services of doctors on call where required. The importance of adequatesupervision of shelters when in use has been emphasised and in areas whereshelters are regularly used for dormitory purposes the necessity for welfare work has been stressed.Difficulties.42. 2,000,000 bunks for Anderson shelters have been ordered from theMinistry of Works and Buildings, and the necessary raw materials have nowbeen made available to enable orders for a further 1,000,000 to be placed. the delivery of the bunks under the orders already placed has been delayed owingpartly to shortage of galvanising facilities and partly to shortage of steel, and similar difficulties may cause delay in further supplies.Central supplies of bunks for public and communal shelters have so far beenadequate to meet the demand, and it is not anticipated that there will be any difficulty in meeting future demands.43. It is not yet clear whether the quota of labour allocated to each Regionfor the purposes of amenities in shelters will be sufficient for the completion ofthe immediate programme before next winter.Lighting Restrictions.4A. The heavy raiding of last autumn and winter did not suggest that anysubstantial change of policy or practice was necessary. At present attention is directed mainly on the installation and control of reduced standards of exteriorlighting to enable work in essential industries and seiwices to continue after the&quot; Purple &quot; warning up to the &quot; Alarm,&quot; and to restart work as soon as possible after the enemy has passed. The needs of railways, docks and ship-repairingyards are being specially provided for, in consultation with the Air Staff.45. The intensity allowed is dependent on the presence or absence of other essential undertakings in the vicinity, on the importance of the work to becarried out, and on the linking of the area or premises concerned with theObserver Corps warning system. It is tested by air observation, and is kept under review.
46 The screening of industrial glare is making progress and it is hopedthat by the autumn almost all important plants will be well enough blacked out to continue work, if necessary, after the receipt of the &quot; Purple &quot; warning up tothe &quot;Alarm.&quot;Sm,oke Protection.47. Smoke screens are in operation for the protection of 32 vital targetsagainst bombing attack on bright moonlight nights. The targets include aircraft factories and vital points in dock areas.A programme of rapid expansion, which aimed at raising the number of targets protected to 50-60 by mid-Summer, 1941, was halted by limitations imposed on the man-power and oil which could be used for smoke protectionwork. Additional targets will, however, be afforded smoke protection under a modified programme as soon as a new type of smoke generator, which makessmaller demands on man-power, can be brought into operation on a large scale.Deliveries of this generator should commence towards the end of August, andthe first of the additional schemes under the modified programme will beintroduced in the early Autumn.Control of the actual period of operation of smoke screens is now exercisedfrom Headquarters. On information received from Fighter Command the tracksfollowed by enemy aircraft are plotted on a special map table. Decisions tomake and extinguish the smoke screens are taken according to the location and scale of activity of enemy aircraft. The result of control has been a considerablesaving in the amount of oil consumed.Camouflage.48. Camouflage policy has recently been reviewed by an inter-departmentalCommittee, whose interim report and detailed recommendations have been presented. The general aim is to provide as high a degree of concealmentas possible in certain areas which the Air Staff consider particularly liable toattack, and in other areas to apply a graded degree of concealment wherebymoderate protection may be provided quickly over a wide area.A Technical Committee is being set up under the Director of Camouflageto co-ordinate and unify the technique and practice of concealment.Air Raid Warnings.49. The Alarm Scheme is being developed in all parts of the country.More than 5,000 concerns are directly connected and receive information,either by speech or by signal, of the near approach of enemy raiders. the lists are being examined to see that as far as possible all factories engagedin Vital Production, and as many of their dispersal points as possible, as wellas Railway Marshalling Yards, &amp;c, have been offered connection to the scheme.Advice and assistance are being given in heavily industrialised areas in thedevelopment of combined raid-spotting schemes. Arrangements are under examination for giving signals to the major ports, sufficient to enable them towork on after the &quot; Purple &quot; warning and still get their lighting out before itcan be seen so as to be useful to enemy raiders.Disposal of TJnexploded Bombs.50. Stejos have been taken to accelerate the disposal of unexploded bombs,which are one of the most important factors retarding reconstruction and therestoration of the life of a town after a heavy raid. The primary responsibilityfor bomb disposal rests with the Army, but the Civil Departments have beer-taking certain steps to facilitate this work of the soldiers.Auxiliary Bomb Disposal Units who can do useful preparatory work,such as sand bagging or digging, are being formed in a large number of factories.A proportion of these squads will also be trained in all the stages of bomb disposal.The Ministry of Aircraft Production has already formed a number of suchsquads. These will have a useful effect on the restoration of production after a raid, and relieve the regular Bomb Disposal units of a great deal of work. (see also the note by the Ministry of Labour.)
Civil Defence Services.Manpower.53. Civil Defence Establishments have been fixed sufficient in the light ofraiding experience to secure that the various services will function adequately, but these are subject to revision, upwards in the light of proved need for additionalstrength which mutual support schemes cannot provide, or downwards if thetheoretic possibilities of fusing the functions of separate services can be realisedwith a consequent saving of manpower. The services consist largely of part-time volunteers, hiost of whom are hot reserved in respect of their primary occupation and are not subject to the Employment and Offences Order, which freezeswhole-time paid members of the services in their employment. Moreover, whole-time Civil Defence personnel are reserved from military service only so far as their duties require the degree of physical strength and endurance to be found in menof 30-40. There has been in the past a good deal of temporary deferment inrespect of unreserved whole-time personnel and a measure of deferment for part-time volunteers. The Ministry of Labour and National Service are reluctant tocontinue these arrangements indefinitely, and the services as a whole are beginning to suffer as a result of the pressure to provide the Fighting Forces with additionalmen and on account of resignations or defections of part-time volunteers. Theposition is one of some anxiety, and the Department will have to rely upon theMinistry of Labour in increasing measure to provide men and women forvacancies arising in services which offer long hours, danger, and few materialadvantages comparable to those offered by employment in many forms of war industry. It may be necessary, if shortages persist, to equalise them by takingpowers to transfer civil defence volunteers from the employ of one local Authorityto that of another.Conditions of Service and Welfare.54. The conditions of service have been considerably improved in the last six months in regard to basic pay, uniforms, overcoats and boots, sick leavefacilities, and amenities generally. There is still room for improvement and,so far as labour and materials permit, Local Authorities will be urged to improve the accommodation and protection for their personnel whether on duty or standing by or resting at their posts and waiting a call to duty or on completion of the tour of duty. The catering arrangements are being overhauled both as regardsmobile canteens and at depots, and an experimental scheme of subsistence allowance for part-time volunteers, where food cannot, be provided, has just been introduced.55. Since the Launching of the Civil Defence Comforts Scheme at thebeginning of this year, 203 out of the 249 scheme-making authorities in Englandand Wales have set up Comforts Committees. Of the 203 registered localcommittees, 113 have reported particulars of their activities to the central committee; these 113 committees have distributed 94.000 comforts and have[22735J c 2The effect of safety precautions on war production, more especiallycommunications, was recently reviewed in order to see whether undue delays werenot being caused by unexploded bombs. As a result of this review and of theresearches into the effect of vibration on unexploded bombs carried out by theEesearch and Experiments Department of the Ministry of Home Security, it hasbeen possible to reduce considerably the safety precautions for bombs on railwaysand also for bombs generally.51. The number of false reports is still large and causes an unnecessaryamount of delay and confusion after a raid. The training of Wardens and police in detection and reporting of unexploded bombs is being intensified. Oneof the measures taken is the production by the Inspector of Fortifications andDirector of Bomb Disposal of a training film.52. Consideration is now being given to a proposal by the Bomb DisposalDirectorate for the recruitment and training of factory personnel, possibly as members of the Home Guard, who would be prepared to undertake the work ofrendering bombs harmless.
10,000 in stock. Gifts of money and comforts have been received by the CentralFund from this country and from overseas. The Central Fund&apos;s balance now stands at  14,834 2.9. 6d.It is proposed to extend the Fund&apos;s activities to include the provision of facilities for sport, recreation and education, in conjunction with bodies suchas the Workers&apos; Educational Association and the British Drama League, whohave readily undertaken to co-operate.Reception Camps for Civil Defence Reinforcements.56. In May the Department invited Regional Commissioners to arrangefor the establishment of reception camps for civil defence reinforcements sentto the aid of important towns or areas. The camps were to be organised and maintained regionally and instructions were given for the work to be pressed forward. Latest reports indicate that the Regions are actively engaged in selecting premises for this purpose, and preparing plans for necessary adaptationand alteration. Sanitation seems likely to present the greatest difficulty at mostplaces, and the supply of labour for this and other works of adaptation may also present a problem.Fire Brigade Organisation?General.57. The preparatory measures for the reorganisation of the fire services on a national basis are in an advanced stage, and the transfer of the Fire services from the local authorities to the Government will take place shortly. The service should be fully established on the new basis long before the winter; but it must notbe supposed that the machinery will be complete and working smoothly from themoment the change over takes place. The principal measures of reorganisationcan only be carried out when the officers in command of the new fire forces havebeen appointed, have conducted a preliminary survey of the ground and have takeneffective control. There is a possibility, indeed, of some loss of efficiency for a short time, but when the new machinery is in being and &apos;&apos; tuned up &apos;&apos; the gain shouldbe great, especially as regards the machinery of control.Apart from the greatly increased facility of reinforcement, which will besecured by the general reorganisation of the Services, steps are also being takento set up in each Region permanent reserve stations, sited with special referenceto main target centres, where reinforcing units will be kept in constant readiness to move to the assistance of raided towns.The formations stationed at these bases will be changed at fairly shortintervals, so that the reserve stations can be used also as centres for combinedtraining. By this means more rapid progress than would otherwise be possiblewill be made towards standardisation of drill and general efficiency in operationssuch as long-distance water relaying.Two such reserve stations are already in being; at least one more is nearlyready for occupation, work on two others will begin at once, and the regional commissioners are engaged in securing accommodation for the rest.The reorganisation of the fire services in Scotland is proceedingpari passu with the corresponding action in England and Wales and the same general considerations apply in both countries.Manpoiver.58. As matters stand, the plan is that 16,000 whole-time men should beadded to the fire service under the National Service Act for the period to theend of June. 1941, and that 5,000 of these men should be added to the LondonFire Brigade. At present the London Fire Brigade has actually received about800 men under the National Service Act procedure. It is vitally important thatthe manpower position should be improved, and improved quickly, in the keycentres, especially in London, and this can only be effected by the operation ofthe National Service Act machinery.* The references to Scotland were supplied by the Scottish Home Department.
59. Moreover, there remains the problem of the further augmentation of thewhole time Auxiliary Fire Service in the present half-year, and it will be mostimportant to have this further augmentation in hand and the men trained well before the winter and its risks set in.&apos;&apos;&quot;80. It is hoped to augment the whole-time establishment of the AuxiliaryFire Service in Scotland by 1,000 men before mid-September.Production of Equipment.61. The Home Office reserves of pumps have now been reduced almost tobedrock, partly by reason of the issue of additional major units to the brigadesand partly because large quantities of equipment have been &apos;&apos; advanced&apos;&apos; to theWar Office, the Ministry of Aircraft Production and other Departments whohad made no provision, or no adequate provision, on their own account. Ordersfor additional major equipment were placed a long time ago, and deliveries arenow beginning to come in, but it will be essential to ensure that the deliveries toFire Forces are maintained, and if possible accelerated, whatever the calls onthe productive capacity for the protection of individual premises.-Hose.62. The hose position is at the moment satisfactory, but if during the winter months losses reach the level which it is reasonable to anticipate, it will beimpossible fo replace them from home production. Steps have been taken by theMinistry of Works and Buildings to devise a programme for the&apos; manufacture ofadditional supplies in Canada and the United States which will cover the require-ments of the National Fire Service and of the other Departments so far as theycan be foreseen, and in any event to keep manufacturers in production.Steel Piping and Other Major Equipment.63. Now that the use of emergency steel piping has been proved to be a practicable and highly satisfactory proposition, it is desired to secure a greatlyaugmented production. An additional allocation of steel has been authorised tocover the considerable quantities involved, but the greatest difficulty lies in securing sufficient numbers of the special types of joint without which the pipingis useless. To meet this difficulty the Ministry of Works and Buildings have, atthe request of the Home Office and with Treasury approval, made themselveslesponsible for capital expenditure which will enable the producing firm to raisetheir output to the maximum. In this way, it is hoped to increase the totalpiping delivered by the end of 1941 to 330 miles.64. A parallel priority problem may arise in connection with the productionof additional fire boats.Static Water Supplies.65. An important programme for obtaining additional water suppliessupplementary to mains supplies was long since opened up by the Home Office inrecommendations to local authorities, and this has now, with the reorganizationof the fire services, been put on a more definite basis. A programme defining in broad terms the objectives to be aimed at in areas of various types has been worked out and Regional Commissioners, to whom, with the consent of theTreasury, a large measure of freedom has been given, have been instructed to implement it. Designs for static water basins, using a variety of materials, havebeen issued. First priority, in terms of building resources and of steel, may benecessary if the programme is to be implemented before the autumn is far advanced.The programme includes pumping installations of a specialised type to overcome the difficulties of tidal waters, although, because of manufacturingdifficulties, definite plans are as yet confined to the Thames.66. The requirements of the main target areas in Scotland are underconsideration and a programme for Wales is being considered, having regard tothe difficulties of man-power and materials.
Fire Prevention.67. The heavy incendiary attacks made by the enemy last autumn led theGovernment in December to decide that, where necessary, the principle of compulsion should be applied to obtain the requisite numbers of part-timepersonnel for fire prevention duties. Accordingly, in January 1941 new defence regulations relating to fire prevention were issued, which included : (a) A new Defence Regulation 27A (in substitution of the original Regula-tion 27A, under which the Fire Watchers Order had been made), which required the Secretary of State to make provision by Order for fire prevention at business premises. Under this Order, the duty of organising fire prevention measures at business premises was placed upon the employer, who was required to consult with his workers,when drawing up his scheme. The responsibility for approving such schemes was distributed among appropriate authorities, whichconsisted of 12 Government Departments and the Local Authorities.(b) Regulation 27B, which defined the duties of Local Authorities as regardsfire prevention organisation and placed on those authorities the dutyof organising parties to cover (a) the area of the Local Authorityelsewhere than on business premises, and (&amp;) business premises wherethe occupier is unable to make adequate arrangements withoutassistance.(c) Regulation 26A, which enables the Secretary of State by Order to make provision requiring persons to be registered and enrolled for com-pulsory part-time Civil Defence duties of such nature as might be prescribed by Order.68.   In virtue of these powers the following Orders were made : (i) The Fire Prevention (Business Premises) Order, 1941.(ii) Civil Defence Duties (Compulsory Enrolment) Order, 1941.(hi) Civil Defence Duties (Exemption Tribunals) Order, 194.1......    .-:69. The experience of the last six months has shown the need for consider -able modifications in the scheme of fire prevention as originally planned; manyof the necessary changes involve amendment and amplifications of the existing regulations and Orders. The more important of the changes required are indicated in the following paragraphs.The Business Premises Order, 1941.70.   The need for the amendment of this Order arises primarily because (i) The acute shortage of part-time personnel available for fire preventionduties on premises, other than business premises, makes it essential toemphasise the conception that fire prevention is a national service andnot merely as at present an incidental condition of employment.(ii) Under the existing Order, there is often a waste in the use of the man-power available at business premises.(iii) It is desirable to define more clearly the duties of occupiers (a) to consult with the workers at their premises, when fire prevention schemes arebeing prepared, and (b) to provide amenities for their workers whenengaged on fire prevention duties at their premises.(iv) Fire prevention should be regarded as a problem involving the protectionof groups of premises and buildings &quot;rather than one concerned only with individual premises,(v) There is no power at present to amend a scheme once it has beenapproved by the appropriate authority.These matters are under urgent review and discussion with the Trades UnionCongress, representatives of employers organisations, appropriate authorities andother interested parties, and it is hoped that agreement will be reached on a revised Order.71. At the same time it is desirable to encourage and possibly enforce by defence Regulations a greater degree of structural protection in certain classesof building against incendiary attacks.  Measures for dealing with such matters
Debris Clearance in London Region.&quot; 80. The Special Commissioner^ Organisation works through the LocalAuthorities, County Councils and Borough Councils, and the various Under-takings, &amp;c, and is concerned with roads, bridges, water, gas, electricity,telephones, main drainage, clearance of debris, demolition as affectingcommunications, salvage of certain classes of material in the London Region.as the complete or partial clearance of top storeys, the provision of &apos;&apos; stoppinglayers &apos;&apos; sufficient to prevent penetration by the smaller types of incendiary bomband the treating of roof timbers with fire retardent preparations are now in preparation.72. Experience has shown the need for the delegation by Departments of authority to their Regional representatives of power to deal effectively with fire prevention problems at factories and other premises for which the Departmentsconcerned are the appropriate authority under the Order. This problem is being dealt with by administrative action by the Departments who have agreed that the regional Commissioners should be given a general right of supervision and controlover fire prevention schemes for all premises in their Regions. The departments will remain the appropriate authorities and in some cases will retain the central control of schemes, but, where this has not already been done, each department is taking steps to appoint a representative in each Region with whom the regional Commissioner will be able to consult.73.   Steps are being taken : (i) To secure a close association between the fire prevention service of LocalAuthorities (which will in future be known as the Fire Guard)and the Warden&apos;s Service and the appointment of personnel for thetraining, supervision and leadership of both voluntary and compulsorilyenrolled Fire Guards.(ii) to obtain powers so as to facilitate the detection and extinction of firesin empty houses.74. It- has also been decided to apply at once the provisions of the civil defence (Compulsory Enrolment) Order to all Urban authorities, the whole areaof which has been prescribed under the Fire Prevention (Business Premises) Order.75. Experience of the operation of the Exemption Tribunals Order suggeststhat it may be desirable to consider whether in the light of the criticisms that have been received any modification of the existing procedure is desirable.Anti-Gas Precautions.76. The state of our anti-gas preparedness was recently reviewed and areport submitted to the War Cabinet by the Lord Privy Seal.77. Education of the public is retarded by the present lull. The value ofpublic gas exercises is being proved. All forms of publicity will be continue during the winter. The conditions of Civilian respirators throughout the countryis, in general, satisfactory; attention has now been turned to their fit,78. The strengthening of the Decontamination Service by the training ofRescue Party personnel and other members of the Civil Defence Force, and the revival of interest through refresher exercises, continues.79. Anti-gas measures in regard to foodstuffs are included in the report submitted by the Ministry of Food. Briefly, by the 1st September all localauthorities are expected to have Food Treatment personnel trained (some 25,000),and two-thirds will have completed their schemes, including preparation of sites and transport. The remainder will be sufficiently advanced for effective improvisa-tion in emergency. 20,000 tarpaulins are now available, and a further 20,000are about to be ordered. Posters are ready for display at points where foodstuffsare handled.
81. Of first importance is the clearance of the main thoroughfares. TheRoad Repair Organisation continues to be fully occupied, and the present lullprovides an opportunity to catch up with past damage.82. In the event of heavy air attack, the arrangement is that debris clearancelabour will be used to the maximum possible extent to supplement the RoadClearance Organisation, the clearance of actual sites being deferred for thepurpose.83. Mutual assistance between local authorities in road repairs is beingfurther developed the ideal in mind being a virtual disregard of local boundaries.84. The combined labour force referred to above and in paragraph 10 belowwill also be used to supplement public utility undertakings in restoring essential services.Water *85. The provision of adequate water supplies is, of course, of prime importance. Repair of water mains does not lend itself to the employment of biggangs because the space available at each crater is limited, and repair isat best a slow process. Emergency arrangements have accordingly beenmade in order to cope so far as practicable with difficulties pending repairs.These include provision to date of 500 tanks, each of 500 gallons capacity, for house-to-house delivery; and the bringing into use of the maximum number ofwells available in private hands. These wells are fairly widely distributed, anda rough estimate of eventual production is one million gallons per hour. Publicitywill also, at the appropriate time, be directed to persuading householders andothers to keep in baths, &amp;c, reserves of water for drinking purposes. Continuedattention is being given to the question of emergency arrangements, and, althoughthe situation is not free from anxiety, it is felt that, short of an attack of sucha kind as might, for instance, necessitate the central Government moving toalternative quarters, the position can be handled.Public Utility Services, Telephones and Main Drainage.86. All possible steps have been taken to facilitate repairs. Gas supplies are particularly vulnerable, and whole districts may, for a time at any rate, asin previous heavy attacks, have to face the unfortunate fact that gas is at lowpressure, or not available. The London Gas Companies have, in previous attacks,shown a commendable zeal in restoration work, and can be relied upon to do everything possible.87. All the Public Utilities have been invited to review once again their arrangements and to make suggestions for any further improvements.88. In order to keep open communications, it may be necessary to fill upcraters regardless of the services damaged therein, and make such arrangements as are possible for the diversion of services.   These arrangements are in hand.89. Large-scale military assistance may be needed, and the General staff has now been asked, in accordance with an already agreed policy, to earmark 3,000Royal Engineers and 5,000 Pioneers for the purpose. The earmarking of billetingaccommodation is in hand. The General Staff have been advised that the fore-going may suffice for initial requirements only.Section B,-MEMORANDUM BY HOME OFFICE AND SCOTTISH home department.Police A dministration.Emergency Wireless Communications.1. Three mobile wireless units consisting of two vans which will be capable ofproviding two-way communication between an area which has been isolated by* Special arrangements (over and above the ordinary sources of water supply) for fire-fighting, e.g., ground tanks and &quot;static water,&quot; are within the sphere of the regional commissioners.
1.7.the breakdown of other means of communication and the rest of the country havebeen equipped and the operating staff are being trained. These will be stationed at strategic points in different parts of England and Wales and will be availableto go where required on the call of the Regional Commissioner. The units will operate under police supervision and will carry messages for fire and other A.R.P.services, and, where necessary, for Government Departments as well as for thepolice Arrangements are being made for the provision of further units beyondthe three already available. One mobile unit will shortly be available in Glasgowto undertake similar work in Scotland. In addition, the development of a regional medium frequency Service is proceeding. In certain cases mobile units are provided for the purpose of the emergency communications with existingstations.2. The provision of local &quot;very high frequency&quot; wireless schemes for police and fire brigade purposes is being proceeded with. Schemes are in opera -tion in a number of areas, but difficulty is being experienced in obtaining suppliesof equipment. Probable target areas are receiving priority in the allocation ofsuch equipment as is available.Traffic Arrangements.3. The police have been advised to make advance plans for dealing withtraffic after a heavy raid, including the employment of military aid, and havedone so. The detailed arrangements must, of course, depend upon the circum-stances existing, and the various interests involved. Effective assistance has been rendered by the military in the past and His Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of Constabularyare ensuring that the necessary plans are made and that there is contact betweenthe police officers concerned and the officers commanding the military units which,would give assistance.Reinforcements.4. The police reinforcement scheme has worked quite satisfactorily in thepast. Difficulties have been experienced in some cases in obtaining food and accommodation. The food problem is part of the general question of reinforce-ments for Civil Defence personnel; but the problem of ensuring accommodation ina heavily raided area naturally presents serious difficulties.Police Strengths.5. Whole-time police establishments, both in England and Scotland, are practically up to strength, except in a few areas, some of which are target areas.There are about 5,500 vacancies in an establishment of nearly 110,000. steps are being taken to fill the vacancies by voluntary recruitment and by the appoint-ment of men enrolled under the National Service Act, 1941. On the other hand,there will be a loss of regular policemen to the R.A.E. for flying duties and tovital industries. An endeavour is being made to arrange for the release of moreregular policemen from the Army. There has also been a considerable decline inthe number of part-time Special Constables, largely as the result of the calling-upof men for military service. The services of these part-time men are of consider-able value in heavily raided areas.Section C-MEMORANDUM BY MINISTRY OF HEALTH and department OF HEALTH FOR SCOTLAND.Provision for the Homeless.Rest Centre Accommodation.1. In and around target areas there are at present about 14,000 rest centresproviding for about 5 per cent, of the population of these areas. The aim is toprovide by the winter enough rest centres to accommodate 8 per cent.The main difficulties in increasing rest centre accommodation are : ;(a) the finding of suitable premises on the fringes of target areas; and(b) the securing of the necessary equipment,[22735] d
2. To enable rest centres to be cleared rapidly, temporary hut hostels areto be provided near towns liable to heavy attack, for the temporary housing ofthose who cannot readily be billeted owing either to their peculiarities or to a very heavy loss of accommodation. These hostels will provide accommodation both forfamilies and for single persons. The aim is to provide accommodation of this type for a total of 200,000 persons at the earliest possible date, and the Ministryof Works and Buildings are, in conjunction with the Ministry of Health,planning the necessary building capacity for this purpose and for the completionof accommodation for at least 50,000 persons before the winter. Hostels for approximatly 4,000 persons in each case are being built at Barrow, Bootle,Hull, Plymouth, Portsmouth and Southampton. The allocation of theremaining 25,000 is now being made. The hostels will be managed by theNational Service Hostels Corporation, set up by the Ministry of Labourand National Service. In Scotland four hostel camps for homeless workers arebeing built conveniently near the industrial centres on Clydeside, and providedthat adequate buiding labour can be obtained they should be completed before theend of the year. Each camp will accommodate 480 single men. The camps arebeing built and will be managed by the Scottish Special Housing Association.Supplies.3. - The formidable task of providing the large quantities of essentialfurniture and other equipment for the additional Rest Centres has been undertaken by the Ministry of Works and Buildings. That Department isexploring every source of supply and will leave nothing undone to secure themaximum provision by the end of October next. But it is not possible, underthe increasingly difficult supply conditions, to fix a date by which full provisioncan be made.4. Large stocks of clothing to meet the immediate needs of bombed outpersons have been received from the American Red Cross and from the CanadianRed Cross. Distribution is effected by the Women&apos;s Voluntary Services throughdepots set up in collaboration with local authorities. These stocks, valued atupwards of  2&quot;millions, are supplemented by other gifts of clothing from overseaswhich are distributed through the Personal Service League and other charitableorganisations. Arrangements are also being made by which considerable quantities of serviceable part-worn clothing from the Services will be distributed to local authorities. All these arrangements are in addition to those being madeby the Board of Trade and other Departments, and referred to at Section F,paragraphs 8 and 9, for additional supplies to shopkeepers outside the limitationquotas and for the issue of coupons.Feeding of Homeless Persons.5. The main problems are to provide adequate stocks of food and to ensurethat cooked food can be supplied although gas and electricity services have failed.Storage difficulties make it impossible for most local authorities to hold morethan a week&apos;s supply of food, but arrangements have been made with the Ministryof Food for assisting in restocking the rest centres when supplies are exhausted.Local Authorities are being pressed to provide solid fuel or oil cookers and theMinistry of Food are considering the practicability of taking over the provisionof cooked food for all additional rest centres.Staffing.6. The whole-time staffs in Rest Centres and Information Centres must be supplemented to a large extent by voluntary workers. Valuable help has beenobtained from such voluntary organisations as Women&apos;s Voluntary Services,the National Council of Social Service, the Friends&apos; Ambulance Unit, and fromChurches and Chapels. In some areas the services of voluntary organisationshave not been used to the full through the failure of the local authority toco-ordinate their activities. Local Authorities are being asked to ensure that full use is made of the services of voluntary bodies. They have also been urged to see that each centre has adequate reserves of workers, that their workers aremade more reliable by training courses and rehearsals, and that mutual aidarrangements are made for calling in voluntary workers from other areas.
7. The rapid clearance of Rest Centres depends on the billeting organisa-tion. Local Authorities are being urged to review their billeting staffs, to appointwhere necessary whole-time billeting officers and to keep their information aboutavailable billets up to date. Special surveys of billeting accommodation have been undertaken on the fringe of target areas, and a Defence Regulation empowering the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State to remove all except normalresidents and essential workers from districts in and near ports and industrialtowns, if their removal is necessary to enable essential workers to carry on, isbeing prepared.8. Special provision for the aged and infirm who cannot readily be billetedis being made by the establishment of hostels and clearing houses for London andcertain other large towns.Information for the Public Immediately after Air Raids.*9. Over 750 local authorities have arranged to set up Information centres and (in target towns) Administrative Centres to advise individual sufferers from air attack. The organisation is complete in London and approaching completionelsewhere. The addresses of the Centres have been made known to the police andA.R.P. wardens and to the public generally. Local authorities of target townshave been urged to arrange special exercises to test the efficiency of these centres and a number of exercises have already been held.10. Pamphlets (one of which was distributed by post to every householder),press advertisements, leaflets and posters telling the public how to get help afterair raid damage have been widely circulated.11. Experience shows, however, that after a raid the public are too anxiousor dazed to remember what to do without enquiry of police or wardens. Furtherpublicity is being undertaken to encourage all who can to make advance arrange-ments to go to friends or relatives. This should reduce confusion among the&quot;bombed out&quot; and relieve pressure on the Rest Centres and billetingorganisations.12. Ministry of Information Emergency Information Officers (appointedby the Regional Information Officer in agreement with the local authority) willorganise post-raid publicity for the public at large. Rapid progress is beingmade with the completion of this organisation in the target towns. In addition,the target towns and the regions have in store 1,300,000 posters (some needing-completion locally) with instructions regarding improvised public services (e.g.,.water, feeding, &amp;c, and health precautions such as boiling water for drinking)ready for immediate exhibition.13. Each Regional inform-mation Officer has available a fleet of loud-speaker vehicles. The regional Press have been urged to make arrangements for alternative printing and to provide mutual assistance. Bulletin sites have been selected for the display of instructions and, in extreme cases, news.Operational Control.14. Difficulties in the working of emergency relief organisation haveemerged because of weakness in the operational control. Special steps are beingtaken to impress on local authorities the need for the establishment of an efficient organisation to control the working of the rest centres and to link it upby an adequate messenger service with the other related services.Co-ordination of Local Authorities.15. After a heavy raid on a target area the rest centres and billetingorganisation in the surrounding areas are called into play. Where the appoint^ment of a Joint Committee of Local Authorities is desirable to ensure adequateco-operation, local authorities are being asked to form such Committees.Advance Headquarters and Mobile Teams.16. Where Regional Commissioners decide to set up Advanced Head-quarters near a town which has been heavily bombed, administrative and* Prepared in conjunction with the Ministry of Information.[22735] d 2
technical officers are sent from the Ministry&apos;s Regional Offices or the Departmentof Health for Scotland, and mobile teams of officers are made available so that,if necessary, they can assist in the emergency relief work when the local personnel are unable to cope with the situation.Planning in advance.17. The efficiency of the local emergency relief organisation depends onthe interest shown by the responsible committee of the local authority. Unlessthe committee realise the importance and difficulty of the problem of the homeless,the arrangements made will not be adequate. Action is. being taken throughofficers of the Ministry of Health and of the Department of Health for scotland to impress on local authorities the importance and urgency of the problem of thehomeless and the necessity for keeping their preparations under constant and active review.Trekkers.18. In accordance with the conclusion arrived at by the Government no official arrangements are to be made for persons who are not homeless but wholeave the target areas nightly in order to sleep in safer districts. The expandedrest centre provision planned (including the hut hostels) will enable temporary accommodation to be given to these persons in- the first few days after heavyraiding and until the homeless can be distinguished from the non-homeless who may have been admitted into the Rest Centres.Evacuation.Evacuation A rrangements.19. There are now approximately 1,300,000 official evacuees in reception areas in England and Wales; and 140,000 in Scotland.20. Transport can be arranged at short notice and billets found in reception areas for the schoolchildren still remaining in evacuation areas in England andWales which may be the subject of concentrated enemy attack. In Scotland,owing to the shortage of accommodation in the reception areas, it would not bepossible to find billets for all the schoolchildren remaining in evacuation areas,although it would probably be possible to find billets for those schoolchildrenwhose parents were willing to allow them to be evacuated.21. In addition to the arrangements for organized evacuation of school-children, facilities for assisted evacuation are available in all the most heavily bombed areas to persons of certain priority classes -e.g., women with children,expectant mothers, aged and infirm and invalid persons who are able to arrangetheir own accommodation.In the case of London, organized evacuation is available for schoolchildren,mothers with children and expectant mothers.22. Powers have been taken to secure the compulsory evacuation of childrenfound on medical examination to be suffering in mind or body as a result of enemy attacks, from any area designated by the Minister. So far the order hasbeen applied to the London Region.23. Plans have been prepared for the application of the Evacuation Scheme,with a minimum of delay, to any area which, by reason of concentrated enemy attack, the Minister may decide to make evacuable. During the spring and early summer of 1941. in consequence of the heavy enemy attacks on the Atlantic ports,the following towns (formerly neutral) were made evacuation areas (wholly or partly) :  Bristol, C.B. Torpoint, U.D. Greenock Burgh.Bebington, B. Cardiff, C.B. Port Glasgow Burgh.Plymouth, C.B. Swansea, C.B. Dumbarton Burgh.Saltash, U.D. Barrow in Furness, C.B.24. The plans for the compulsory evacuation, upon the threat of invasion,of the civil population of the &apos;&apos; 31 towns 5&apos; in East Anglia, Kent and Sussex haverecently been revised and are ready to be put into operation at short notice.
Welfare of Evacuees.25. In regard to welfare, efforts have been directed primarily to ensuring that with another war winter before us, we can retain the goodwill and co-opera-tion so far shown in abundance by the hosts and hostesses in reception areas, and can ensure conditions which will encourage evacuees to remain contentedly in the reception areas.26. Much invaluable work is being clone by billeting officers and many thousands of voluntary workers throughout the country. There are over 100,000voluntary workers enrolled in the evacuation services of Women&apos;s voluntary services alone. To organise and still further stimulate the efforts that are beingmade, the Ministry of Health have appointed 20 Welfare Officers on the RegionalStaffs; and steps are being taken to increase the number, with a view particularly to co-ordinating the welfare services for the homeless and for evacuees. CountyCouncils have appointed some 50 Welfare Organisers, and District Councils have appointed some 70 Welfare Organisers and Social Workers to carry out welfarework in their respective areas. Much of this is case work and adjustingdifficulties in billets.27. Actual provision so far made for evacuees in reception areas in Englandand Wales includes the following :  743 mothers&apos; clubs.701 occupational clubs.92 war-time nurseries.297 nursery play-rooms, &amp;c.245 residential nurseries.622 hostels for children.92 emergency maternity homes.710 hostels  for mothers and children,  expectant  and  nursing mothers, and aged persons.488 communal feeding centres.30 school camps.34,078 houses requisitioned and otherwise acquired, including theLondon Region.In Scotland the following provision has been made : 6 residential nurseries.150 hostels for children.25 other hostels.11 emergency maternity homes.5 school camps.125 requisitioned houses.The war-time nurseries, while intended primarily for the children of womenwar-workers, also serve to mitigate the difficulties in dealing with young childrenevacuated with their mothers.28. The 220 residential nurseries (providing about 7,000 beds) are for children under 5 whose mothers are unable to accompany them. The care ofthese children presents one of the most difficult problems of evacuation. Theextent to which provision can be made is governed by the limitations of suitable accommodation, equipment and staffing, all of which must be of high standard ifthe health and well-being of these babies are to be safeguarded.29. At present it is necessary to restrict acceptance of children under 5for places in these nurseries to cases where there is an over-riding reason which prevents the mother from accompanying the child.30. Intensive efforts are being made to increase the number of residentialnurseries, but for the reasons indicated the extent of the provision is likely to beon a limited scale.First Aid Repairs to Houses.31. Of the 13 million houses in the United Kingdom about 115,000 have been destroyed to date or damaged beyond repair, and 2 million have been damagedbut are repairable (excluding those with a few broken windows only). Of the 2millions, it is estimated that about 10 per cent, are so seriously damaged as to
be uninhabitable pending extended repairs. Ninety per cent, of the remainderhave received first aid repair, though in many cases only the first stage of suchrepair has been done.32. First aid repairs, which are given the highest priority of building work,are mostly carried out by local authorities, either by their own employees or through local contractors. They have their own stocks of materials, and they cancall on the Government emergency reserves.If the labour proves inadequate, reinforcements can be secured as follows : (a) From neighbouring local authorities under schemes of mutual assistance;many large local authorities have an &apos;&apos; expeditionary force &apos;&apos; ready tomove off at a moments notice.(b) From the Special Repair Service of the Ministry of Works and Buildingscomprising 5,000 men especially released from the Army.(c) By the mobilisation through the &quot;Ministry of Works and Buildings ofadditional contractors.(d) By the diversion by the Ministry of Works and Buildings of labour,with supervisory staff and equipment, from other contracts.(e) In very special cases, from the military.33. The foregoing arrangements should enable local authorities to deal withmajor damage to houses on airy possible scale. Theoretically, since the only limit is the total number of craftsmen and labourers in the country as a whole, up toone million houses could be first aid repaired&apos; in a week. To meet difficulties as to accommodation for the workmen, camps are being constructed at particularplaces, and huts are held ready for speedy erection.To promote speedy first-aid repairs in the event of heavy raiding in the winter,renewed emphasis is being laid on the policy of carrying out repairs in two stages first, a quick run round to patch up roofs and windows, followed by internal work and more extended repairs later. The stock of tarpaulins for roofcoverings held in the Government reserves is being increased from 40,000 (whichsufficed last year) to 90,000.34. Arrears of first-aid repair work are being rapidly overtaken and permanent repairs on a small scale are being carried out. If heavy attackspersist during the winter, little in the way of permanent repairs will be possible;if not, it will probably be found to be necessary to embark on a substantialprogramme of permanent repairs in order to maintain morale.A accommodation for Munition Workers and for the Homeless.35. Building labour and materials are short. It is therefore essential thatthe fullest use should be made of existing accommodation. This has been securedup to the present firstly by voluntary arrangements with householders and secondly by billeting and by the requisitioning of houses. In some cases townshave been &quot; closed,&quot; thus enabling local authorities to regulate the flow ofwould-be residents.36. In specially difficult cases new houses for munition workers have beenor are being built by local authorities and hostels near the factories are being built either by the Ministry of Works and Buildings or by the production department concerned.37. Up to the present all demands have been met, but it is clear that difficulties will arise in some towns, particularly if they are heavily attacked, andthe Housing (War Requirements) Committee,&quot;which has recently been directed by a conference of Ministers presided over by the Lord President of the Councilto make a speedy review of the problem, is concentrating on an examination ofthe position in 70 towns.Hospitals.38. Accommodation now available is considered sufficient to meet likelyeventualities.39.   First-class beds empty and ready number 94,000 plus 16,000 in Scotland,a total of 110,000; beds empty and ready in auxiliary hospitals 5,500, plus 4,200, in Scotland, a total of 9,700; empty reserve beds for which staff would have to
be obtained 31,700, plus 4,000 in Scotland, a total of 35,700; beds from whichpatients can be discharged within 24 hours at least 43,000 (and probably many more if necessary) in England and Wales, the corresponding figure for scotland is 3,000; beds in reserve hospitals (public schools, &amp;c.) which could be madeavailable in a few hours and would have to be staffed 70,000. Similar reserveprovision in Scotland will provide some 8,000 beds. The total is 244,200 279,400including Scotland-plus (say) 50,000 which could be provided in acute Emergencyby discharging existing patients. The hut-building programme is continuallybringing more beds into use and is estimated to add about 8,000 beds by the endof July and a further 3,000 by September; in Scotland the corresponding figures are 2,000 by the end of July and a further 2,000 by the end of September.40. The total provision of well over 300,000 beds is for air raid casualties and service casualties as well as any other patients requiring immediate treat-ment in hospitals.41. If all these beds had to be used, staffing would present a serious problem and could only be met by spreading staff more thinly than at present. TheShakespeare Committee is considering allocation of doctors as between militaryand civilian services so as to make the best use of doctors available. Alien doctors and final year students are also being used. Proposals to give power to preventnursing and lay staffs from leaving hospital service and for the compulsoryredistribution of staff amongst hospitals according to the needs are being submitted to Home Policy Committee.42. An underground hospital unit for immediate treatment of air raidcasualties (virtually a casualty clearing station) has been provided in a basementlarge stores in Birmingham. Similar arrangements are being made in several other great cities.First-Aid Posts and Ambulances.43. In total strength these services have proved adequate and are considered to be so for the future. Improvements in organisation are being made in the lightof raiding experience. The medical equipment of first-aid posts has been revised.Steps are being taken to introduce a greater degree of mobility into the staffs atfixed first-aid posts and to develop the principles of reinforcement and mutual assistance. The structural protection of the posts is being strengthened invulnerable areas as the supply position of labour and material permits.44. Plans have been made for adapting the fittings of the ambulances sothat they will carry sitting as well as stretcher cases, and the organisation of separate regional reserves stationed at strategic points is being explored.45. As regards anti-gas precautions, about 1,000 special public cleansingcentres are erected or in course of erection in England and Wales, plus some 150in Scotland, in addition to a wide expansion of the existing facilities at first-aidposts and the arrangements for dealing with contaminated civilian clothing arebeing improved and extended. Special steps have been taken by lectures andleaflets to provide the whole medical profession with the latest knowledge as tothe diagnosis and treatment of gas casualties of all kinds.Water Supplies.46. The principal local authorities and companies have built up and aremaintaining substantial stocks of spare pipes. A number of additional inter-connections between undertakings have been made for emergency use. Stand-bypumping plant has been provided in appropriate cases, and emergency sources ofsupply have been investigated. Provision has also been made for carting wateron a considerable scale. These activities, representing capital expenditure forwar purposes of nearly  1,650,000 to date, are grant-aided. Storage tanks havebeen installed and other special measures taken in the South-Eastern Region,primarily for military reasons at &quot; nodal points.&quot; Mutual aid arrangementscovering labour, plant, pipes and cartage of water are widespread, are constantlybeing improved, and have proved their value. The scale of stocks, while basedon study of air raid experience in the various heavily bombed areas, assumes that much heavier bombing is yet to come.   So far, even in the worst areas, there has
been no serious damage to works, though there has been considerable damage tomains and temporary interruption of piped supply. The Service and supply departments make their own arrangements for water for Service establishments and vital war factories, with full co-operation from the Ministry of Health asrequisite. These supplies are often quite independent of the public water under -takings, though supplies from the latter are also frequent as a stand-by orotherwise.47. No great difficulty has been experienced as regards labour, doubtlessbecause a very great deal of preparatory work was done prior to or in the early days of the war. For repairs, the services of Special Construction CompaniesR.E. have on occasion proved invaluable as a reinforcement of the labourobtained under the mutual aid plans. Delivery of additional pumping plant is somewhat slow, but the general position as regards these is fairly good.48. The Ministry and the Department of Health for Scotland believe thaton the whole arrangements against bombing attack are adequate for maintainingat least a limited supply for essential needs.Local Authority Man Power.49. Local authority staffs have been hard hit by the calling up for militaryservice of experienced personnel. With the raising to 35 of the age of reservation,arrangements have been made for the long-term deferment of selected men whichit is hoped may enable local authorities to carry on their civil defence and other essential services.   It is essential that this position should be held.A problem which is becoming increasingly acute at the present time arises in connection with the men over 40, women, and grade 4 men who have beenappointed as substitutes for experienced men called up for military service.Under the various Orders dealing with industrial organisation which haverecently been made, some of these persons have been induced to go into industry.Section D. MEMORANDUM BY MINISTRY OF WAR TRANSPORT.Passenger Transport.1. Regional Transport Commissioners, with the assistance of local railwayofficers, and of Local Consultative Committees of operators, managements and workers, have under constant review the adequacy of passenger transport arrange-ments in their regions, with, of course, special reference to transport of workersin war industries. They will also work in this respect with the production executive&apos;s Regional Boards.Among the matters to which particular attention is being given are:  (a) staggering of hours of workers;(b) greater use of railways, where available, by adjustment of services,fares, &amp;c.;(c) segregation of hours of travel of workers, shoppers, &amp;c.2. Arrangements between railways and road transport operators providefor immediate substitution of &apos;buses for interrupted rail passenger services.3. Transport of essential workers evacuated considerable distances fromdamaged homes is provided by a scheme under which the worker contributes 3s. aweek and the rest of the cost is met by the Regional Transport Commissioner.4. To cope with the situation arising from heavy raids. Regional TransportCommissioners visit the towns affected and arrange for operation of necessaryservices, including the covering of interrupted railway services by &apos; buses and thesupplementing of local vehicles by borrowing from other operators under mutual aid schemes.5. In London the closest arrangements exist between the London passenger transport Board and the railways for mutual assistance in case of interruption of services. The London and South-Eastern Regional Board has, in conjunctionwith the Ministry of War Transport, the L.P.T.B. and the Railways, organiseda system of staggering of hours covering the Metropolitan area.
6. Local Emergency Transport Committees (representing the RegionalTransport Commissioner, railways, Supply Departments, local authorities andthe Ministries of Labour and Food) are being set up in all important productioncentres, and after a heavy raid the Regional (Civil) Commissioner, in consultationwith the Regional Transport Commissioner and the Supply Departments,convenes the Committee to determine relative priorities of demands for goodstransport by rail and road.7. The Regional Transport Commissioner arranges for the provision ofgoods vehicles to supplement the local authorities&apos; resources for clearance ofdebris, removal of stock and furniture, dispersal of factories and maintenance ofpublic services.&apos;8. Departments have been asked to place their contracts in such a way as toavoid needlessly long or difficult hauls. (Treasury authority has been given tomeet extra cost involved.)9. Large-scale movements of commodities and materials are being planned to avoid unnecessary haulage and facilitate loading in bulk.10. Policy of rationalisation of distribution on an area basis in order to cutout cross hauls is being pursued with Departments concerned.11.   In addition, the following specific measures may be mentioned :  Railways.(i) Railways Operating Organisation strengthened so that constant super-vision of working maintained and arrangements rapidly made fordiversion of traffic by alternative routes or to alternative destinations.Detailed plans, which can quickly be put into effect, include a numberof emergency rail-head depots on the outskirts of London and largeindustrial centres.(ii) Arrangements made for meeting an emergency by rapid transfer of engines from one area to another, either domestically or from anotherCompany&apos;s system.(iii) Speeds of passenger and  freight trains during alerts have been increased from 25 m.p.h. by day and 15 at night to no limit by day and 30 by night.(iv) A special control has been set up to secure more rapid and efficient dis-tribution of all wagon stock,(v) Lighting. A new standard of lighting for use in marshalling yardsbetween the Purple and the Alarm signals and between the release ofthe Alarm and the All Clear has been tried and found to be of value.The R.A.F. are testing its visibility, after which it is likely to beinstalled in a number of yards. Other lighting arrangements aregradually being improved.(vi) Telephone Communications have been strengthened as a means of easingof congestion and delay under difficult conditions arising from air raid damage.(vii) Use of wireless. A scheme for providing some 95 installations has beenapproved and&apos;31 operating stations have been, or are being, established;when experience has been gained, the numbers will be increased. (Inthe raid the lOth/llth May, a portable equipment of the S.R. success-fully maintained communication between Clapham Junction andDeepdene.)(viii) Traffic-facilitating works on Ministry of Transport account. the progressive completion of alternative routes, additional running lines and sidings, enlargements of marshalling yards and signallingimprovements will have an important effect in increasing capacityat all times and in re-establishing working after local dislocation from air raid damage.(ix) To increase capacity for goods traffic, means of enabling long-distancepassenger services to be reduced are being examined.[22735] e
Road Transport.(i) Abolition of basic fuel rations for &apos;bus and coach operators is contemplated to give R.T.C.&apos;s better control of operators running onbasic ration only.(ii) Supply of vehicles is &quot; tight.&quot; Arrangements have been made withMinistry of Supply for resuming output of double-decker &apos; buses (200up to end of 1941, and 1,400 next year), and use of small single-deckerson a standard chassis and possibly of articulated vehicles for passengerwork is being investigated. On the goods side &quot;tippers&quot; are in heavy demand. The Ministry of Supply have agreed a programmeof production but this is not yet in its stride,(iii) The supply of drivers for both passenger and goods vehicles is also&quot; tight.&quot; Endeavours are being made to substitute women on thelighter vehicles and transfer the men so released to the heaviervehicles.Highways.Measures taken to mitigate effect of black-out.12. Highway authorities have been encouraged to extend the use ofpermanent materials for traffic lines, and experiments have been and are being conducted with various forms of more durable guide lines, with a view to lesseningthe frequency of renewals and of securing effective maintenance during thewinter months.13. Steps are being taken to make more conspicuous island refuges andother road obstructions, and those which experience has shown are the cause offrequent accidents have been removed.14. This Department is collaborating with the Ministry of Home security to secure uniformity of practice in the lighting of all permanent roadobstructions.15. Parts of military road blocks impinging upon the carriageways arebeing removed, where operational conditions permit, and labour and materials areavailable for replacing them by removable obstacles.Repairs of damage to roads and bridges.16. Priority in repair is given to roads of special military or industrialimportance. The stocks of materials accumulated at the outbreak of war to meet this contingency have proved adequate. As materials are used to restore roadsor bridges the stocks are replenished.17. Steps are being taken to ensure that the specially-trained bridge repairgangs who are in the employment of engineering contractors are being keptreadily available to meet emergencies caused by serious damage to bridges.Cancds.18. So that canals may play a more effective part in the rapid clearance of ports, steps have been and are being taken to secure the quicker movement andturn-round of canal craft by the provision of engines for boats, handling plant,transit sheds, sorting depots and warehouses. On experience to date, the existingprotective measures on canals (mainly the provision of stop-planks and spare lockgates) are considered adequate.Ports.19.   Measures taken include :  (i) Clearance of inflammable materials (e.g., timber stocks) to inlandpoints.(ii) Improvements of lighting have been installed at most of the principalports. Arrangements have been made at Glasgow to link up the docklighting system with the &quot; alarm within the alert,&quot; so as to enablework to proceed until danger is imminent; the practicability of extending this to other ports is being examined in conjunction with air Ministry and Home Security.
27(iii) Fire prevention measures in docks are being overhauled and privateproperties in the dock areas are being included in dock schemes. Theposition of ships&apos; crews in port has also been regularised in this respect,and arrangements made for facilitating removal of berthed shipsduring incendiary attacks.(iv) Railways have  standing instructions to pay  special  attention  toclearance of ports.(v) The R.T.C.&apos;s organisation is available for port needs, but special arrangements have been made including Port Road Transport Poolsat the main ports; &apos;&apos; Shadow Groups &apos;&apos; of operators to fetch goodswhere experience has shown these to be desirable; arrangements withthe War Office for loading available Army transport; the proposedGovernment Road Haulage Scheme, to deal with trunk Governmenttraffic, will be valuable for port clearance work.Section E. MEMORANDUM BY ELECTRICITY COMMISSION.General Precautionary Measures.1. Early in 1938 a general A.R.P. scheme for electricity supply had been worked out in consultation between the A.R.P. Department of the Home Officeand a National A.R.P. Committee for the Electricity Supply Industry set up bythe Electricity Commissioners; and was communicated to all supply authorities.Subsequent reports on the steps taken or proposed by individual undertakingswere approved by the Electricity Commissioners under the Civil Defence Act,in a number of cases with modifications.2. The general scheme provided for the protection of generating station and sub-station buildings and the plant therein; for the maintenance of supplies;for precautions against fire; for protection of workers; and for decontaminationand first aid.3. In the light of air raid experience, further protective measures weredevised for the main units of generating plant in the principal stations uponwhich the National Grid System depends; and approved measures of these kindshave been carried out in some stations and are in progress in others.Reserve Pool of Emergency Equipment.4. A national Reserve of Emergency Equipment (large transformers,switchgear, &amp;c.) principally for restoring bulk supplies was authorised beforethe war and was completed and available within a few months after the outbreakof war. The Equipment is located at convenient storage centres in less vunerable areas, and special transport facilities for the heavy equipment (transformers upto 70 tons) have been arranged.5. All electricity undertakers are fully informed of the procedure for obtaining temporary use of Emergency Equipment; and as far as possible sites for installing the heavy units have been earmarked and in some cases prepared in advance in industrial areas which may constitute targets.Restoration of Supplies : Mutual A id.6. For repairing local transmission and distribution systems and restoringsupplies to individual factories and other consumers, electricity undertakers have formed mutual aid groups throughout the country to pool their resources of skilled labour, spare stock of cables, &amp;c.7. All electricity undertakers have been notified of the principal difficulties experienced in heavily bombed areas and of the expedients which have been devised or resorted to for the most rapid restoration of supplies.Reinforcements of National Grid System.8. Reinforcements of the National Grid System approved by the production executive are in hand to enable substantial transfers of electricity to be made from certain Grid areas to others to safeguard war production in&quot; the event of damage to generating stations.   Every effort is being made to complete these[22735] e 2
reinforcements by or before the end of the Autumn. Shortage of labour has&apos; been experienced, but is being overcome by collaboration with the Ministry of Labourand National Service.General Position9. Up to the present, air raid damage to generating plant upon which thenational electricity requirements ultimately depend has been relatively small.The maximum amount of generating plant damaged or immobilised at the endof any month was only 266,000 K.W. (at the end of October 1940), out of atotal installed capacity (inclusive of reserve, plant under overhaul, &amp;c.) of about10.000,000 K.W. in all the public supply stations. These figures do not constitute a measure of air raid risks to generating stations.10. Damage to the National Grid System itself, whether by barrage balloonsor enemy action, has generally been repaired within a few hours; and therehave been no major prolonged interruptions of supply from any part of theGrid System.11. The value of the Grid System and also of the national Reserve ofEmergency Equipment for the speedy restoration of bulk supplies after heavy air raids has been fully demonstrated; while the extent to which the public supply-has been maintained under air raid conditions and the general promptness (apartfrom isolated cases) with which damage has been repaired and supplies restored to all consumers in a position to make use of a supply bear testimony to the generalefficacy of the A.R.P. measures which have been taken as well as to the skill and devotion to duty of the staffs of electricity undertakings.12. Apart from the completion of the measures referred to in paragraph 3and the Grid reinforcements referred to in paragraph 8 above, there are no other special steps still remaining to be taken. The Electricity Commissioners have advised all supply authorities to make an immediate review of their A.R.P.measures so as to be fully prepared for air raid contingencies during the coming months; and they will continue to acquaint supply authorities at once with anyspecial lessons to be learned from air raid damage to particular undertakings.Section F. MEMORANDUM BY THE BOARD OF TRADE.Maintenance of Gas Supplies.1. The arrangements for mutual assistance between gas undertakingsinstituted last year will be continued. The Regional Gas Engineering Advisershave taken the necessary steps to see that the stocks of spares held by under-takings are up to the standard required. Particular attention is being paid tothe supply of pumps for pumping out flooded mains.2. The London Gas Centre, after consultation with Sir Warren Fisher, theSpecial Commissioner, have put forward a number of proposals for inter-connection of mains between undertakings in the London Region which have beenapproved. A number of proposals of the same kind have been approved in other regions, of which the most important are (a) two inter-connections between Manchester Corporation and StretfordGas Board to give emergency supplies to Trafford Park;(b) four inter-connections between the G.W.R. Company&apos;s undertaking atSwindon and the Swindon Gas Company;(c) Cheltenham, Gloucester and Stroud Companies;(d) Chorley Corporation and Leyland Gas Company for Leyland Motors;(e) Bristol and Bath for supplies to Corsham.The extension of the ring main at Coventry, though it is not an inter-connectionscheme, has the same object in view. Opportunities for inter-connection schemes are limited not only by geographical considerations, but also by the fact that thereis often no surplus gas available in any of the adjacent undertakings.3. Good progress has been made in ensuring that undertakings areadequately equipped both as to material and personnel for fire prevention.Schemes have already been approved for 258 undertakings, representing approxi-mately 90 per cent, of the gas produced in the prescribed areas.
4. Many undertakings, notably Birmingham, are in difficulty over labour,and this shortage will be felt most seriously in the event of concentrated air-raidsnotwithstanding the mutual aid scheme. The industry has been brought underthe Essential Works Order, and the undertakings concerned are being scheduled,but it may become necessary to ask for the release of further skilled men fromthe Forces.5. Some progress has been made towards provision of alternative sources of fuel where gas is used in important war factories, and an extension of this policy,where possible, by the installation of gas producers, &amp;c, is desirable.Restoration of Shopping Facilities (excluding Food).6. The Board are considering, with the Ministry of Works and buildings and the Ministry of Health, a scheme for the provision of pre-fabricated shoppingbooths which could be sent on loan to bombed towns where air attack causes animmediate serious shortage of retail outlets. The need for such a scheme wasnot felt last winter.7. So far as more permanent restoration of shopping facilities is concerned,the Board&apos;s policy is to advise and assist in the preparation of schemes to be operated by Local Authorities taking account of the essential needs of the locality and the necessity for economy in labour and materials.Supply of Clothes to Homeless Persons.8. Arrangements between the Board, on the one hand, and the assistance board and Customs on the other, ensure that bombed persons can rapidly obtainsufficient coupons to permit them to purchase a reasonable stock of clothing. TheAssistance Board and Customs are at the moment looking into the possibility oflaying in and dispensing large stocks of these coupons in advance of the winter.9. But the possession of coupons by the bombed person does not automatically produce the goods required. The shops may themselves have lost their stocks in the same raid. To meet this difficulty, the arrangements madelast year under which shopkeepers can obtain further supplies outside thelimitation quotas will be continued.Section G. MEMORANDUM BY MINISTRY OF WORKS and buildings.Emergency Works Organisation.1. The Emergency Works Department of the Ministry of Works and buildings is now completely organised to assist (in close contact with thevarious other Ministries concerned and their local representatives) in the repair of war factories, houses, &amp;c, in demolition and clearance, and in fire-fightingservices, such as the provision of static water supply. For this purpose a network of staff has been set up throughout the country. Emergency stocks of materials are being built up in all target towns, and sites selected to be used as clearing-houses for material brought in from outside. Builders and roofing contractorsare brought in whenever necessary and are being organised so that they may bemore effective and more quickly put to essential repair work. Arrangements arebeing made with the Board of Trade for the Ministry of Works and Buildingsto supply pre-fabricated buildings for temporary use as shops, where necessary.The Emergency Works Department is responsible for the salvage of steel and timber from damaged buildings outside London. It also directs the disposal ofsalvaged building material, and maintains control of the stocks of steel sheetpiling for use in repair of docks, &amp;c.Hutment Schemes.2. The War Production Departments are carrying out large schemes ofdispersal both of Government factories and of factories belonging to manu-facturers. For these, hostels to house some 73,000 dispersed workers and their families are being built by the Ministry of Works and Buildings, and a further65,000 by the Ministries of Aircraft Production and Supply.
3. The Ministry of Works and Buildings is, at request of Ministry ofHealth, building intermediate hostels for 25,000 people outside six target townson the coast, and accommodation for a like number will be started as soon as thefirst programme is complete, The total programme under this heading isestimated at present at 200,000.In Scotland the Scottish Special Housing Association are erecting fourhostel camps near target areas on the Clyde on behalf of the Department ofHealth.4. Over and above this, plans are being made to deal with further largepotential demands for the rehousing of homeless people. Special steps are being-taken to develop production of pre-fabricated huts of all suitable types makingmaximum use of non-imported materials.Section H.-MEMORANDUM BY MINISTRY OF LABOUR and national SERVICE.Labour&apos; Supply for Repairs.1. There is a general shortage of all classes of building and civil engineeringlabour for contractors of Government contracts directly connected with the war effort, virtually all of which are behind schedule.2. At the 1st June, 1941, unfilled demands, excluding those for repairs to factories, other essential works and houses arising from enemy action, werecraftsmen 13,400, labourers 39,600; total 53,000. Estimated demands for periodof 2 months from the 1st June, 1941, craftsmen 27,500, labourers 52,500;total 80,000.3. There is no indication of any diminution in total labour force requiredto ensure desired rate of progress on Government building programme; more-over, Departments have waiting lists of further contracts.4. Under the Ministry of Works and Buildings licensing system onlyessential projects are authorised.5. Provision of additional labour on any extensive scale for repair ofdamaged buildings and other emergency repairs could only be secured at expenseof the Government building programme.6. The scheme under consideration by the Ministry of Works and Buildingsfor the registration of all contractors should, however, facilitate the diversion of private contractors and their labour to repair work.Fire Prevention (Btisiness Premises) Order.7. The Ministry of Labour is the &quot; appropriate authority&quot; for theadministration of this Order in all factories, other than those of the supply departments, where more than 30 persons are employed. Some 20,000-25,000establishments are subject to guidance and control through the Factory Inspec-torate. One of the difficulties is the lack of sufficient personnel in the verynumerous smaller establishments. The whole question is under discussion withthe British Employers&apos; Confederation and the Trades Union Congress general council, with a view to the making of a revised Order and the establishment ofregionalised machinery under the control of the Regional Commissioners.Working after the A lert.8. Last winter, in consultation with the National Joint Advisory Council,the Ministry of Labour established a system of Local Production DefenceCommittees working under the Council and consisting of representatives ofemployers and employed and of the technical members of the staffs of the regional commissioners. There are now 23 of these Committees, covering a 15-mile radiusround the main munition production centres, and the number can quickly beincreased if necessary. These Committees have worked very successfully in promoting the raid spotter system and other systems of getting &quot;an Alarm withinthe Alert. Progress is being made in the provision of emergency cover near places of work, since immediately available shelter is an essential feature of the scheme.
Section I.-MEMORANDUM BY THE ASSISTANCE BOARD.1. The principal services which the Assistance Board administer, either under statutory direction or as agents for other Government Departments, are :  (a) Unemployment Assistance.(b) Supplementary Pensions.(c) Prevention and Relief of Distress due to the War.(d) Injury Allowances (on behalf of the Ministry of Pensions).(e) Compensation for War Damage Advances to meet immediate needs (onbehalf of the Board of Trade).9. Last winter a considerable amount of productive time was lost becauseof the real or suspected presence on factory premises of unexploded bombs, andof the delay before the Royal Engineers came to attend to them, especially thosewhich were given a low degree of priority by the Regional Commissioner. Ascheme for Auxiliary Bomb &quot;Disposal Units to detect and verify the presence ofsuch bombs and to do preliminary disposal work has accordingly been worked out.The Units will consist of civilians under a leader trained at the Army School,and, to begin with, the scheme will be confined to factories employing 500 or more people. The Ministry of Labour has approached firms, other than those of theSupply Departments,&quot;to obtain the names of the persons designated for training,and arrange for them to go to the Army School. Enough names are already available to keep the Army School supplied for some time, and by the winter months a large number of these units should be in existence.Welfare Officers.&quot;10. The normal duties of Welfare Officers are to see that satisfactory-arrangements exist outside the factory for the housing, transport and feeding ofwar workers, especially transferred workers, and they have been instructed torender every assistance possible after a raid to the representatives of the regional commissioners and the local representatives of Government Departments.Controllers of Divisions have been asked in this connection to arrange for additional assistance to be given, as necessary, to Welfare Officers.Factory Canteens.11. Factory canteens have been used to a certain extent for emergency,feeding as distinct from day-to-day feeding under war conditions, factory manage-ments having provided additional meals for their workpeople, or meals for more of their workpeople and in some cases for members of their workpeople&apos;s families.The amount of help which can be given in this way is, however, very limited. Thevast majority of factories in this country are too small to have canteens, and thenumber with canteens already in existence or due for completion in the immediatefuture is only about 2,500 to 3,000. Moreover, there are objections in many cases to admitting strangers to the factory, on defence grounds and because of interference with production.12. The Factory Inspectors have no responsibility for making emergencyfeeding arrangements, either in anticipation of or immediately after an air attack. They have, however, taken opportunities of advising factory manage-ments to consider the matter in advance, and to bear in mind, for example, theadvantage of having alternative means of heating (an arrangement widely adoptedin the case of factory canteens recently established or enlarged) and of keeping asa &quot; stand-by,&quot; so far as reasonably possible, equipment which they may haveinstalled for temporary feeding arrangements pending the establishment of their permanent canteen, Moreover, Inspectors are instructed to make themselvesfamiliar with the local arrangements for providing supplies of food, cooking and feeding equipment in an emergency, and to give firms in their districts anyinformal help they can, after an air-attack, by way of information as to the properauthorities to approach for supplies and other assistance, and by way of hintsas to improvising feeding and other welfare arrangements in the factory if itspremises have been damaged.
2. Administration of these services is decentralised into approximately 500offices, grouped into 33 districts, each under a District Officer who is answerablefor all the offices in his District. With few exceptions each of the Board&apos;s officeshandles all the types of business for which the Board is responsible.3. The main burden thrown on the Board by air raids is in connection withadvances of Compensation for War Damage (item (e) above). It might appearthat a serious dislocation of industry by raiding would lead to numerous applica-tions for Unemployment Assistance (item (a)), but, in fact, people who find themselves temporarily without work in such circumstances ordinarily claimunemployment insurance benefit and obtain other work long before their title to benefit is exhausted. Payments under the scheme for the Prevention and relief of Distress due to the War (item (c)) are not, under present conditions, a large part of the Board&apos;s work, though they include payments to women billeted underthe Evacuation Scheme whose husbands are not in a position to support them.Applications for Injury Allowances (item (d)) would be greatly increased by heavy raiding, but the scale of the work in comparison with the work of makingadvances of compensation is indicated by the fact that in all the Board has dealtwith less than a hundred thousand applications for Injury Allowances, whereasit has dealt with about a million applications for advances of War DamageCompensation.4. The problems of dealing with the normal work of the Board and the vastvolume of additional functions resulting from air raid attack are partly problemsof staff, partly problems of accommodation and partly problems of organisationwithin the office.5.   The duties for which staff are required are : (a) Interviewing, assessment and payments.(b) Marshalling the crowd.(c) Registration work.(d) Investigation of the damage.These duties require very different degrees of skill and experience. Inparticular, the assessment work requires trained officers who are capable ofappreciating all the points of a case and of dealing with it in a sympathetic,responsible and expeditious manner.6. The great majority of the Board&apos;s offices serve areas which are&apos;&apos; vulnerable &apos;&apos; in the sense either that they are sufficiently industrialised to beattractive targets or else that (like the East coast) they are particularly open toattack. It is out of the question for the Board to keep all these areas supplied with the staff necessary to deal with traffic resulting from heavy raiding. Whenthe occasion arises the staff is found to some extent by suspending the normalwork of the office, but there are limits beyond which this is not practicable, e.g.,pension order books must be renewed at the due dates. To some extent staff canbe recruited from the crowd, and people so recruited do good work provided thatthere is a sufficient nucleus of experienced staff for them to work with. For therest the Board rely on the quick transport of staff to the point of pressure fromthe nearest offices which are in a position to spare staff. After the April raids on Plymouth valuable help was given by experienced officers brought fromBristol and South Wales, beside staff drawn from nearer offices, such asTorquay and Exeter. After the raid on London on the lOth-llth May staff wastaken to the districts most affected (the centre, the east and the south-east) fromthe western parts of London (which had suffered little damage), from Reading,Guildford and Tunbridge Wells. The Board are experimenting with a mobileunit to overcome the difficulties which arise in transporting officers to the scene of operations and sometimes (as at Plymouth) in finding them accommodation whenthey have got there.7. The main staff weakness with which the Board have to contend is theshortage of experienced officers capable of organisation, control and assessingduties. This shortage will be much accentuated if the reserved age for the grades in question is raised to 35, and the Board have made representations on the subjectto the Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Kennet.8. After an adequate supply of staff the next&apos; most important factor in securing smooth working is suitable accommodation.   This is not entirely in the
Board&apos;s hands, as their war damage work is largely done in premises which havebeen provided by the Local Authority to serve as Administrative Centres wherethe whole of the needs of the victims of air raids can be attended to. LocalAuthorities tend to underestimate the scale of the accommodation required forthe Board&apos;s business. The Administrative Centres in London have now mostlybeen brought up to the size which experience shows to be necessary, and the board are actively engaged in surveying the situation outside London with a view to ensuring that the Local Authority appreciates the Board&apos;s requirements.9. Given adequate staff and suitable premises the problem of organising thework within the office is largely one of common sense and alertness in handlingcrowds and of Augilance in arranging and varying the disposition of the staff tosecure that the work flows evenly. The procedure to which officers are requiredto conform has been restricted to the necessary minimum, and officers have been left with great freedom to improvise their method in the light of the require-ments as they present themselves when the emergency has to be tackled. Guidanceis always at hand from the District Office, the staff of which have opportunities of acquainting themselves with the experience of other districts as well as theirown. Officers have responded to the confidence put in their powers of improvisa-tion, and the Board consider that their policy has been justified by its results andoffers the best prospect of satisfactory work if their officers are faced wdthconditions of greater difficulty and confusion than they have hitherto experienced.10. The responsibility of the Board&apos;s officers in connection with these advances of compensation to replace necessary clothing, furniture, &amp;c, is confined to providing the necessary cash (and in the case of clothing, coupons). They areunable to guarantee that shops will be open for the supply of goods, or, if theyopen, that they will have supplies of clothing, bedding, hardware, &amp;c, sufficientto meet the demands on them.Section J.-MEMORANDUM BY MINISTRY OF PENSIONS.1. The Assistance Board, acting as agents for the Ministry of Pensions, dealwith applications for injury allowances from persons incapable of work by reasonof war injuries (see Section I), and the Ministry deals through its own machinerywith claims to pension from the dependants of civil defence volunteers and gain-fully occupied persons who are killed. This provides for the setting up of temporary offices where necessary or the despatch of experienced officers to the districts concerned. In either case, there is close co-operation with theadministrative centres set up by the Ministry of Health (see Section C,para. 9), and every endeavour is made to establish contact with widows andorphans in order to assist them in the preparation of their claims and to ensureproper care for orphans. At the same time, the first of ten weekly payments ofa special temporary allowance of 50?. is made to widows.Section K.-MEMORANDUM BY MINISTRY OF FOOD.Matters with tuhich the Ministry of Food is wholly Concerned.1. As a precaution against the loss of foodstuffs by air attack a widedispersal of stocks has been made, and there is now available in each of the104 zones into which the country has been divided for the purpose a stock of themore essential foodstuffs sufficient to subsist the population of that zone for about 14 days, exclusive of stocks in the hands of retailers. In addition, all local Authorities coming within the Emergency Meals Scheme hold substantialstocks of &quot; blitz &quot; foods, and these stocks are supplemented by reserves at strategicpoints throughout the country. Each Divisional Food Officer also has under his personal control a stock of mixed foodstuffs for use as a last reserve sufficient inthe aggregate to subsist 10 million people for approximately three days. certain other dispositions of foodstuffs have been made in connection with the invasionplans.[22735] f
2. All arrangements have been made for the removal of wholesale marketsto suitable alternative sites; the destruction of one of these markets should not affect distribution for more than a few hours.3. Suitable premises for use as temporary wholesale warehouses are beingearmarked in the vicinity of the principal centres of wholesale food distribution.4. Experience has shown that there is no difficulty following heavy air attack in maintaining supplies of rationed foodstuffs, chiefly because the commodities are in Ministry ownership and can be moved forward as required.With a view to achieving a &quot;similar flexibility in regard to unrationed foodstuffs,plans are now being made to establish in every Food Division one or more dumpsof unrationed commodities which will be drawn upon as may be necessaryfollowing air attack to replace damaged stocks in wholesale and retail premises and maintain the flow of unrationed foods. It is hoped that these dumps willbe in operation by the 1st September.5. With the object of strengthening the Wholesale Provisions trade organisation serving London and the Home Counties and rendering it capableof maintaining distribution under severe emergency conditions all wholesalersconcerned will shortly be required to give a written undertaking that they willconform with certain specified requirements. A panel of traders under theindependent Chairmanship of Sir Ernest Hiley will be responsible for satisfyingitself that the required conditions are observed by all wholesalers concerned.6. While it is not possible to say that the&apos; scheme will be complete in all respects by the 1st September, there is no doubt but that the London WholesaleTrade will be very materially strengthened by this date.Maintenance of Retail Distribution.7. Plans are being prepared in all the more vulnerable towns of the countrywhereby temporary shopping centres, supplemented where necessary by travellingshops, could be brought into operation immediately in the event of a substantial number of retail shops in the town being put out of action.8. It is expected that these arrangements will be completed in the more vulnerable towns by the 1st September.Emergency Meals Service.9. Foodstuffs for 10 per cent, of the population have been distributed toEmergency Meals Centres in London and in 147 of the largest and most vulnerablecities and towns. By the 1st September all cooking equipment will also havebeen placed in these Centres. In the Greater London area, food and equipment for an additional 2\ per cent, of the population have been provided at pointsfrom which it may be transported to meet demands created by large-scale move-ments of the population.10. Cooking Depots to deal with 5 per cent, of the population will also havebeen established outside 33 of the most important towns. From these Depotsfood can be taken in heat-retaining containers, either into the towns, to areasoutside the towns to which part of the population may migrate, or to reception areas within 15 miles of the Depots.11. It should be emphasised that the effectiveness of the arrangements whichhave been made for dealing with the effects of air attack upon food supply anddistribution depend to a substantial extent upon such general services as transport and communications.Matters with which the Ministry of Food is Concerned, but which are in part theResponsibility of Other Departments.Shelters.12. The provision of equipment for the service of light refreshments in air raid shelters (including Tube stations) in London is completed. similar arrangements should also be completed by the 1st September in all provincialcities where such arrangements are necessary.
Section L.-MEMORANDUM BY GENERAL POST OFFICE.1. The following notes deal with the various services handled by the PostOffice, and indicate the probable position during the winter of 1941 in comparisonwith 1940 : Postal Services.2. The difficulties met with in the autumn and early winter of 1940 were largely overcome in January this year following rearrangements whereby theNoon/1 p.m. London postings for England and Wales obtained delivery by first post the following morning. The arrangements introduced in January have since been perfected, and for the coming winter normally the Postal Communica-tions will be maintained more or less as obtaining at the present time,except that the posting and delivery times in London will revert to the pre-double summer time arrangements : that is, the last delivery in London will commenceearlier (at 3/3 - 30 p.m.), and the last collection will be : Head Districts, 5 - 30 p.m.,Sub-Districts 4/4-30 p.m.3. Alternative offices are ready to function immediately to replace anyPostal Distributing office which may be put out of action, and Road transport is available to bridge any gaps in Railway communications following enemy action.Telegraph Service.4. The telegraph service last winter suffered severely, due to the destructionof the Central Telegraph Office and to the extensive damage to cables in central london. In the Provinces the difficulties experienced were mainly due to thedestruction of telegraph instrument rooms in certain cities, the damage to cablesnot being such a serious trouble.5. To meet conditions during the coming winter in London four telegraphcentres have been established away from the Central area with independentcircuits to provincial centres. These offices are working now. They are linked with one another by circuits in cables in the tube railways or by routes avoiding the central areas as far as is practicable. The reserve Central Telegraph Office,which had been provided in a deep basement before the war, also has circuitsto the Provinces in the tube railway cables. A reserve office, equipped to carry allessential traffic, is also established in the suburbs.[22735] g13. It is expected that by the 1st September next all Local Authoritiesprincipally concerned will have available trained and equipped food-treatmentpersonnel, numbering in all about 25,000, under the supervision of speciallyauthorised officers and that at least 1,000 Local Authorities or two-thirds of thewhole will have completed their schemes and have prepared special decontamina-tion sites and transport facilities. In the areas of the remaining LocalAuthorities schemes will be in an advanced stage of preparation so that rapidimprovisation of facilities will be possible if necessary. Every effort will bemade in the next two months to secure the completion by all Local authorities of their preparations.14. For the protection of foodstuffs against poison gas 20,000 specialtarpaulins are now available in various parts of the country. A further order for 20,000 tarpaulins is about to be placed with the Ministry of Supply and some part of this order will have been delivered by the 1st September next.15. 45,000 copies of a poster stressing the importance of covering foodstuffswhen in transit are now ready for display at all points at which foodstuffs arehandled.Food Salvage.16. Instructions will shortly be issued to Divisional Food Officers to augment their Food Salvage Staffs, and by the 1st September the DivisionalSalvage Organisation should be in full readiness to deal with the effects ofheavier air attack.
6. Similar schemes of decentralisation are in process of installation in theimportant provincial cities. Some 60 offices were equipped before the war togive a skeleton service from basement locations. This number has been increasedto 120 and the level of reserve service brought up to about 50 per cent. Many ofthem are already available and all will be available by the autumn.7. There are certain difficulties regarding the completion of protectivearrangements at the offices where additional provision has been made for telegraphreserves. The Ministry of Works and Buildings is doing its best to meetthe Post Office requirements in this respect, but all the protective arrangementscannot be available by the autumn. Some of them will undoubtedly mature ata later date. It is considered that a satisfactory telegraph service can bemaintained throughout the country for all essential traffic, even under more intensive bombing than was experienced last winter.Telephone Service.8. The Post Office is responsible for the communications required by allthe Defence Services. With the fall of France last summer, the demand forcircuits in this country grew enormously, and the Post Office has looked uponthe provision of circuits for the Defence Departments as a first charge on its resources. Labour was therefore concentrated very largely on work of a purelydefence character (e.g., Radio location, new Sectors and Groups, new aerodromes,protection schemes in Whitehall tunnel and Citadels). Schemes which would havebenefited Supply Departments had, therefore, to stand over for some months,and much of the work programmed for completion by last autumn had to be deferred until the current year. Briefly, the effect has been that traffic has suffereddelays due to shortage of circuits, and during last winter the severe damageintensified this difficult)r. The problem has been most serious in London, wherethe damage in the Central area approached a condition of almost complete breakdown.9. To minimise the effect of cable damage additional cables have beenprovided in the tube railways and, assuming that Faraday Building is notdestroyed, a satisfactory service should be practicable for all essential traffic, eventhough there may be heavy damage to the cable system. A citadel is being built at Faraday Building, but it is not likely to be available to house equipment untilearly in 1942. Exchanges on the outskirts are already equipped to take over theoperation of the essential trunk and toll service if Faraday Building were destroyed before the Citadel is ready and working. Difficulty is not anticipatedabout restoring service to essential subscribers if their local exchange is destroyed,either by connection to nearby exchanges or by the installation of emergencyequipment held available for the purpose.10. In the Provinces switchboards were provided in basement accommoda-tion at about 50 manually-operated exchanges. By the beginning of the winterwell over 200 will have been brought into service, covering all large- and medium-size towns. In addition, at 100 other towns facilities will have been completedto give service for important lines from neighbouring towns. Where automaticexchanges are in operation local service is given by the machine, and the main problem is to give trunk and toll service. This was catered for by subscribersdialling a special code to reach a distant trunk centre. The scheme was not considered entirely satisfactory, and swntchboards are being installed in protected accommodation in all important automatic exchange areas so that a reasonabletrunk and toll service may be available to all essential subscribers. The diallingcode scheme will continue in use at the exchanges of lesser importance, but agreater number of outlets will be provided.11. In addition to the above arrangements, steps have been taken to intercept trunk and junction cables at the fringes of towns, and in some 70 townssmall emergency exchanges are being installed at the interception points. Linksare being provided between the interception points by ring cables to minimise the risk of interruption where the centre of a town is devastated.12. Here, also, difficulties have to be faced regarding the protectivearrangements in the refuges where switchboards are being installed. TheMinistry of Works and Buildings is doing its best to meet Post Office require-
merits. Difficulties are also becoming greater regarding the supply of apparatus,mainly because demands on a large scale are being made by the Ministry of aircraft Production and the Ministry of Supply for items of apparatus usednormally for Post Office purposes. High-level priority is being demanded for these items, and if they have to be met the Post Office will be in difficulty in meetingthe demands, even in respect of many items for defence purposes. This question has already been reported on to the Production Executive.13. Eeviewing the telephone position as a whole, it is considered that asatisfactory service will be maintained for all essential purposes and to someextent a reasonable service for the general business community, even thoughbombing should be on a heavier scale than during last winter.Section M. MEMORANDUM BY THE BOARD OF EDUCATION and scottish EDUCATION DEPARTMENT.1. The principal concern of the Board and Scottish Education department is to keep education going on normal lines to utmost extent compatible with war conditions, both for the sake of the children&apos;s education and for the preservation of morale.England and Wales.2. Extent of damage to schools already serious. Of 23,000 Elementary and secondary Schools, 3,000 have suffered minor damage and 1,000 seriously damaged or destroyed. The former are taken in hand at once and brought back into service. The latter are lost to education for the duration and, being for themost part in urban areas, are usually the larger schools.3. If further damage on the same lines and to the same extent is sufferedin the coming winter, serious damage to education can be avoided only in thefollowing ways : &apos;(a) A greater measure of evacuation from evacuation areas.   Last Aprilthere were actually 10,000 fewer evacuated children than inDecember 1940.(b) The avoidance, as far as may be, of the use of schools for extraneouspurposes, e.^.,srest centres, community feeding centres, &amp;c. where such user is imperative its duration should be limited to as few daysas possible.(c) The availability of pre-fabricated huts for use as temporary schoolaccommodation in blitzed areas. Steps are being taken through theMinistry of Supply to secure a certain number of such huts.4. Teachers are as necessary to education as school premises. The calling up of teachers for military service and their diversion to other essential warwork has meant a heavy loss to teaching power. This loss has been made good(quantitatively but not qualitatively by employment of married women and otherretired teachers. This reserve is now virtually exhausted, and will be whollyexhausted when men teachers between 30 and 35 are called up. Agreement hasbeen reached with the Ministry of Labour and National Service that, apart from some quite unforeseen development in the war situation, there should be nofurther increase in the age of reservation for teachers.There should be no further call on teaching staffs to man rest centres,communal feeding centres and the like, except for very short periods immediatelyafter a heavy raid.Scotland.5. In Scotland the damage to schools has not been on the same scale as inEngland, but the Scottish Education Department are in general agreement with what is said above.[22735] &apos;        g 2
Section N. MEMORANDUM BY MINISTRY OF aircraft production.Emergency Services Organisation.I. The Emergency Services Organisation was set up a year ago to facilitate the repair of air raid damage to war production factories connected with all threeSupply Departments. It will face the coming winter fully organised, trained andtested by experience and possessing established contacts with factories and withall authorities concerned with every aspect of air raid damage.2. The entire country is now covered by a network, of Local ReconstructionPanels. The present total is 120. In target districts this local voluntaryorganisation of industrial representatives has been specially strengthened byofficial assistance from the Area Headquarters of the Ministry of aircraft production.3. The Ministry of Aircraft Production^ Regional Organisation, whichdirects and co-ordinates the activities of the Panels, has been strengthened bythe recruitment of additional staff, the appointment of dispersal officers tofacilitate the re-housing of damaged firms and the posting to the areas of FinanceOfficers with sufficient authority to resolve where necessary any financial difficulty that is likely to hinder the re-establishment of production at a damaged factory.4. The principal advantage next winter will lie in the experience gained bythe Organisation through having dealt with close on 4,000 cases of damagedfactories. All target areas, including the ports, have had much experience,notably Belfast, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Barrow, Swansea, Cardiff,Bristol, Avonmouth, Plymouth, Portsmouth Southampton, London, Hull,Coventry, Birmingham, Sheffield and Newcastle. The Panels in most other districts have also been tested.5. Widespread contact has been established with industry. Forms forreporting war damage have been sent to 15,000 war production factories,including all vital factories, to ensure that there shall be no delay in makingcontact with the proper authority and securing immediate attention by the LocalReconstruction Panel. Throughout the past year, firms have been encouraged to make the utmost use of their own resources of labour and equipment for selfhelp and mutual aid in the event of air raid damage.6. Through its Local Reconstruction Panels and Area Organisations theEmergency Services Organisation has secured the enrolment in Emergency RepairSquads of over 50,000 tradesmen in various parts of the country who havevolunteered their services to the Ministry of Labour to assist in restoring essential services and to help with emergency repairs vital to the life of the community.7. A system of surveying and reporting on damage to war productionfactories has been perfected, utilising the services of local officers of the threeSupply Ministries, members of the Local Reconstruction Panels and localtechnicians temporarily engaged for the purpose.8. Complete liaison has been established in the regions between the LocalReconstruction Panels and the local representatives of other Government Depart-ments, with local authorities and with public utility undertakings.9. A system for authorising the release of controlled materials, with special priority for the repair of war production factories, has been worked out with the timber and Iron and Steel Controls and is operating successfully. For the supplyof other building materials the Emergency Services Organisation relies on theMinistry of Works and Buildings to ensure that adequate stocks are available and will be forthcoming speedily in the event of serious damage.10. Before next winter a stock of over 300.000 tarpaulins will have beenaccumulated in depots throughout the country to provide protection for plant and improvised roof covering pending completion of permanent repairs. A yearago the Organisation had none.II. In collaboration with the Industrial Gas Centres, arrangements havebeen made for the adjustment of industrial gas fired apparatus in factories to

Proper defence against temporary supply and transport interruptions iswell distributed stocks (a) with consumers, (b) (for house coal) with merchants,(c) in the hands of the Government. Policy being followed of maximum dispersalduring summer only limit, amount of production. Stock targets set higher in areas distant from coalfields or otherwise difficult to supply.2.   Basic estimate of coal needs, the 1st May, 1941, to the 30th April, 1942 212-5 million tons.   Production in first 6 months of period 106 million tons,assuming recruitment of 15,000 additional men by the 1st August.   Unlikely&apos;winter production will rise above 100 million tons.3.   Reduction in demand possible by (a) Reduction in railway and coke-oven requirements on latest availablefigures;(&amp;) Reduction in exports;(c) Restriction of domestic consumption, legally and by economy propaganda.4.

This would mean starting next winter with stocks at same level asbeginning of last winter, which is regarded as irreducible minimum.7.   Policy based on following assumptions :  (i) Recruitment of additional 15,000 men of right types forthwith;(ii) Restriction (already imposed) on domestic deliveries; comprehensiverationing scheme at later date;(iii) Average land and sea transport facilities no worse than last winter.Coal Production and Man-Power.8. On the 4th March, 1941, the Lord President^ Coal Committee approved a programme calling for a weekly production of 4^ millions tons of coal for the function at sub-normal gas pressure. Pools of emergency equipment have been created to provide first aid service to firms whose gas supply may be interrupted.Arrangements have been concluded with Balloon Command to utilise theirhydrogen cylinders and compressors for the supply of compressed gas for vitalapparatus in a dire emergency.12. As a result of the efforts of the Fire Prevention Branches of the supply departments and the improved fire watching arrangements made under the fire prevention (Business Premises) Order, 1941, it is considered that the risk of fire in war production factories has been materially reduced.13. The efficiency with which the Emergency Services Organisation will beable to achieve the speedy restoration of production in war production factoriesdepends to a large extent on the co-operation available from other GovernmentDepartments and local authorities. It greatly facilitates the discharge of this responsibility if there has been set up in advance by Regional Commissioners inevery target district Co-ordinating Committees on the lines outlined in Section A,paragraph 18, above.
seven months to the 31st October, 1941. This programme was designed to meetthe total requirements for summer consumption plus a contribution of 24 million tons to be put to stock during the summer against winter needs. The programme was put to the coal-mining industry at a conference on the 27th March, and theindustry pledged itself to do its utmost to meet the demand. immediately thereafter target figures were notified to each coal-producing district, and for themost part the districts have accepted them and allocated pit targets to individualmines.9. It has, however, been recognised that an increase in man-power to theindustry is essential if the production demanded is to be achieved, and theMinistry of Labour and National Service were asked to secure the return of50,000 ex-miners to the coal-mining industry from other occupations, includingthe forces, to which they had migrated. The first demand was for return fromthe forces.10. The figures put forward as the demand for coal were subject to substantial criticism, and as discussion proceeded decisions were taken to reducethe demand for man-power and to take some steps with a view to reducingconsumption of coal. On the 13th June the&apos; Government decided at this stagethere should be no return of ex-miners from the Forces, but that an appeal shouldbe made to men who had migrated to other industry to volunteer to return to coal mining. It was the intention that if this appeal did not prove successful in producing the number of men required, compulsory registration should beresorted to.11. The number of men responding to the appeal for volunteers onlyreached about 400, and as a consequence it has now been decided to call for compulsory registration of men Avho at any time after the 1st January, 1935,had been employed in coal mining for six months or more and who are between20 and 60 years of age, and it is the intention to order these men back to the mines up to a total of 25,000 men. The only exception to this registration order is men who are in the Merchant Navy.12. The production of coal in the first four months of the summer period,that is, down to the 26th July, was 67 million tons, and information furnished by the mines indicates that, if 25,000 men are returned and if the proportion ofoccupations of the men is suitable, output should be increased by 200,000 tonsa week. It is considered that the present strength of 690,000 men could produce a maximum of 4^ million tons a week, so that, with the men to be returned, a figureof 4,450,000 tons per week might be attainable. These outputs, however, couldnot be reached except by means of a specially intensive effort lasting only for ashort period and could not be regularly maintained.13. Assuming the men to be returned to the pits before the end of July,there will still be a shortage of coal on the programme approved on the 4th Marchamounting to about 7 million tons at the end of October which is now impossibleto make good.Government Stocking.14. There is, in Government stock at the present time, 1,184,000 tons of coal,of which two-thirds is house coal and one-third suitable for gas or electric worksor factories.  The stock is spread for the most part in the non-producing districts.15. It is our aim to stock 3,000,000 tons in all, and ample stocking spacehas been acquired; we shall not resume stocking till we have given merchants and private consumers a chance to get some coal, but we must probably go aheadby the middle of August.16. The Miners&apos; Welfare Commission, acting on behalf of the Department,is organising the provision of canteen facilities at the mines. Pithead canteensfor at least 450,000 men have already been provided or are under negotiation and further rapid progress is being made.
. Special Transport Steps.17. The following are the main steps of a special kind which have beentaken to deal with the effects of enemy air attack on transport:- (a) Road Scheme. Detailed plans have been made for the transport of upto 50,000 tons of coal a week by road from the north side of the Thamesto South London and the South-Eastern Division in the event of the cross river-rail communication being interrupted. It is estimated thatthis tonnage would ensure the maintenance of full supplies, so long asthe interruption of traffic does not exceed 75 per cent, of its normalcapacity.(b) Emergency Transport Committees. The Mines Department is repre-sented on the local Emergency Transport Committees which are being set up by Regional Commissioners to deal with demands on transportafter severe air raid damage in particular areas.(c) Diversion arrangements. Machinery has been devised for the diversion of any consignments of coal held up in course of transit by rail andunable to reach its destination within a reasonable time owing to enemy action. This machinery can be used either for clearingparticular lines of communication at short notice, or relievingcongestion in marshalling yards or sidings, and is operated both locallyand at Headquarters under the provisions of Defence Regulation 56b.It has been used extensively since the Autumn of 1940, both in Londonand the provinces.House Coal Distribution (Emergency) Scheme.18. During recent weeks a marked and welcome improvement has beennoted. The large majority of the merchants have agreed to carry out theco-operative pooling principles of the Scheme, e.g., as to coal, labour and trans-port, where the need for economy or an emergency arises.In the bombed areas we have already received practical proof of thelocal merchants&apos; willingness and ability to apply the local mutual-aid schemes towhich they had previously subscribed on paper.19. Particular attention is now being paid to all districts which may belagging behind and a general tightening up against next winter is being every-where applied.20. Our House Coal Officers and their Assistants have given a strong andlargely effective lead to the merchants throughout the country: the Officials(voluntary) appointed by the merchants have done equally well. Their ranks arevery nearly complete, some 3,400 Depot Managers and 360 District House CoalOfficers already being at work.21. The possibility of bringing the retail coal distributive trade withinthe field of the Essential Work Order is under consideration, in consultationwith the Ministry of Labour and National Service, but the difficulties in this trade are very great. Somehow, however, means will have to be found to safe-guard a minimum of essential labour.Section P.-MEMORANDUM BY PETROLEUM DEPARTMENT.1. The Petroleum Department has been concentrating on rehabilitating the stocks of petroleum products, especially the stock of motor spirit which hadseriously declined under the conditions prevailing since last autumn. It is alsocontinuing vigorously the programme of protecting the stocks by passive defence measures, e.g., walling and bunding of tanks and by strengthening, so far as circumstances allow, the active defence measures on which the Department is dependent on the Military.2. The arrangements made by the Department for dealing with the petrolin localities subjected to a heavy bombing attack have been tested in past months
and have worked satisfactorily. Liaison is at once established by the localDivisional Petroleum Office with the Regional Commissioner, and subsequentaction is concerted with him. When necessary a local office is temporarily opened in the bombed area. The Petroleum Board, as the authority responsible foractual supplies, works in co-operation with the local authorities and can quicklymake additional supplies available by road transport from neighbouring districts.3. It was found possible last winter to give considerable assistance topassenger transport by the issue of petrol coupons outside the ordinary rules inbombed areas as circumstances required. These arrangements will be continued.In London special assistance was given by the &apos;&apos; Help Your Neighbour &apos;&apos; Scheme,and, should it be found necessary to reintroduce it or any similar scheme inLondon or elsewhere, fuel will be supplied for it so far as the stock positionallows. This is not at present as good as it was last year. The demands of theServices are increasing, and the winter requirements of fuel for goods vehiclesare likely to rise (although to an unpredictable extent) owing to damage torailways by enemy action and to slower working due to black-out. The combined effect of the growth and the dispersal of production also makes increasing demands on fuel. Nevertheless, the policy of building up stocks of motor spirit and of increased rationing of the civil use of petrol are the best measures that can be taken to fortify the position against possible additional demands arisingout of air attacks in the coming winter.
