SECRET.F.P.(M.)(41)20,3RD MARCH,  1941, COPY NO.WAR CABINET.FOOD POLICY COMMITTEE.PROPOSED EXTENSION OF RATIONING.Memorandum by the Minister of Food.lo Hitherto we have confined rationing to essential foodstuffs which lend themselves to the principle of uniformrationing.      In these we have secured equality of distribution^The amount distributed is less than people have been accustomed to having and,  as a consequence,  their demandsare moving on to other items of food   that are notrationed,.In the case of many of these foodstuffs the shortageof supplies and absence of control has led tomaldistribution^      This is a main cause of the queuesthat we are beginning to experience, and it is in myopinion urgently necessary to take effective steps tocontrol distribution on a much wider scale.2o I am quite satisfied that it is administrativelyimpracticable effectively&quot;to control distribution bymeans of uniform rationing on the lines we have adopted for meat, bacon, sugar, fats and tea.      The attemptto do so would place an impossible burden on the already overworked Headquarters and Divisional staffs of my Ministry,      Moreover,  complete coupon rationingover the many foodstuffs involved would create new andpowerful incentives to evasion;    there would be an extensive increase of offences;    enforcement would bedifficultoFurthermore, many of the commodities in questiondo not lend themselves to uniform rationing owing, forinstance, to variation in the consumer&apos;s needs and theimpracticability of retailing in quantities differingfrom customary packings.3o To meet this situation I propose to adopt a new form of rationing which, while designed to ensure fairdistribution, will fall short of complete coupon rationing.I propose to introduce a scheme of this character at once for jam, marmalade, syrup and treacles      The essentialsof the scheme are as follows:- *

4. The -consumers will be invited to register withtheir retailer and registration will be a condition ofobtaining supplies of any of the articles in the group.The retailer will be required, by Order, not to supply to consumers other than those registered with him, butit will.not be an offence to sell to registered consumersmore than a stated amounts      It may be thought to bea defect of the scheme that it does not make it an offence to buy or sell more than a stated quantity.Eventually we may come to this, but I am anxious tomake the experiment of relying on retailers and consumersto playfair   and I am anxious to avoid multiplyingoffences.      Moreover,  it would not be possible to introduce a full coupon rationing scheme quickly and in view ofexisting complaints of maldistribution and the developmentof    queues time is of the essence0      The; scheme is infact an official recognition and general application ofwhat is,  in fact, being done at present by the bestretailers,  and I have been assured that retailers&apos; and manufacturers generally will welcome it.5. :       Retailers will obtain their supplies in theordinary course from their normal suppliers.      Cases will,however,  arise in consequence of the introduction of registration in which some retailers will not beable to get the whole of their requirements from their normal suppliers,  and some suppliers will have an excessof supplies over and above the requirements of their normal retailers.      It is proposed to adjust this position through the machinery of a clearing house whichwill be an Executive Committee composed of representativesof the manufacturers and retailers with representativesof the Ministry.      Manufacturers will be licensed andthe Ministry will have power to give directions as todistribution by manufacturers to retailers.      Distributionby manufactur ara to retailers, will be verified by the clearing house on the basis of vouchers issued by thePood Executive Officers.6. A possible criticism of the scheme is that itentitles the registered consumer to a ration which doesnot absorb the whole of the supplies and leaves availablefor distribution a surplus of supplies over and above theamount required to meet the ration.      The scheme providesthat this surplus distribution shall be restricted toregistered consumers,  and it is intended that the amountof this surplus shall be restricted to a minimum. Therewill not be any large surplus available for freedistribution in a manner that might give rise to complaints of inequality.      In time, as the scheme develops, it isanticipated that the surplus will be negligible.7. I ask the Committee to approve in principle theproposal to introduce immediately a group rationing schemefor jam, marmalade and other bread spreads.:(Intld.)
