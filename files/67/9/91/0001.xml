Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1941.SECRET. Copy No.    02W.P. (G) (41) 91.September 3, 1941.WAR CABINET.INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON BLACK-OUTRESTRICTIONS.REPORT,A. Summary of Conclusions.WE summarise our conclusions as follows :  Fitting and Maintenance of Masks.(1) Steps should be taken to ensure that the standard of lighting used on road vehicles corresponds to that permitted under the regulations. The Produc-tion Departments, in consultation, where necessary, with the Ministries of home security and War Transport, should impress upon road haulage contractors theimportance of proper fitting and maintenance of head-lamp masks and should advise upon the best methods of securing that they give the full amount of lightallowed. Departments themselves owning transport should take similar steps tosee that their vehicles are properly lit.Rear Lights.(2) We recommend that, in place of the present regulations (requiring rearlights to be clearly visible at 30 yards and invisible at 300 yards), there should besubstituted a provision that rear lights may be used without any of the present restrictions, except that there shall be inserted a single layer of diffusingmaterial, such as tissue paper.Reflector Studs.(3) We recommend that the installation of reflector studs on all main roadsshould be extended as far as is practicable.Head Lights.(4) We recommend that in future vehicles should be permitted to use twohead lamps, each fitted with a mask, giving a light of the maximum intensity atpresent permitted for a single head lamp.(5) The concessions referred to in (2) and (4) above should apply to allvehicles in all parts of the country.Lighting in Shipyards.(6) We recommend that the Ministry of Home Security, in consultation withthe Departments concerned, should examine the suggestion that lights in ship-yards should be allowed to be turned on earlier in the morning, e.g., one hourbefore sunrise.[22887] B
Lighting of Railway Stations and Post Office Loading Platforms.(7) We recommend that the Railway Lighting Sub-Committee of the railway executive Committee should be invited to consider a suggestion made by thePostmaster-General for an improvement in lighting conditions at railway stations and post office loading platforms, particularly in London.Lighting in Factories.(8) After careful consideration, we are unable to suggest any relaxation ofthe existing black-out regulations for factories.The reasons on which the foregoing conclusions are based are set out more fully in our report (Section B below).B. Report.I. Introductory.The Minute by the Prime Minister (see Annex) instructed us to devise thebest possible plan for the relaxation of the black-out restrictions on vehicles andfor factories and ports during the present comparative lull in the enemy&apos;s air attack. The preparation of the plan was to be considered as a technical study,not necessarily committing the Ministerial heads of the departments concerned to its adoption.2. We deal below with this question under the three headings of :lighting of vehicles; external lighting in ports, &amp;c.; and interior lighting in factories where the black-out has been damaged.II. Lighting of Vehicles.3. It is clear that, if the lighting of vehicles is to be increased, some corn-promise must be found between considerations of security and the demand for greater freedom of movement. The Air Staff have emphasized that the showingof any light involves some degree of risk and that the present masked lightingwhich is visible at appreciable heights from the air is by no means free fromdanger. On grounds of security, therefore, any increase in the amount of lightpermitted is open to objection. The Ministry of Supply, on the other hand, have drawn attention to the restrictive effect of the black-out on commercial motortraffic. This is to be measured not merely by the reduction in speed of the vehiclesactually on the road. The most serious effect is the cessation or partial cessation of road services owing to the difficulty of driving in the black-out and to the highrisk of accident. The Ministry of Supply state that a large proportion of the night services of hauliers was curtailed or entirely suspended last winter for these reasons.Fitting and Maintenance of Masks.4. The present character of the lighting restrictions is not entirely to blame for this curtailment. Police tests have repeatedly shown that even to-day aconsiderable proportion of the vehicles on the road are not fitted with lighting upto the maximum intensity at present approved. Masks may be unsuitable or badlyfitted or may not be maintained in proper condition. We consider that the first step to be taken is to ensure that the standard of lighting used corresponds more closely to the maximum permitted by the regulations. The Production Depart-ments, in consultation where necessary with the Ministries of Home Security and war Transport, should impress upon road haulage contractors the importance of proper fitting and maintenance of headlamp masks, and should advise upon thebest methods of securing that they give the full amount of light allowed. Stepsof this kind are most clearly called for where a contractor informs the departmentof his decision to discontinue night services. Departments themselves owningtransport should take similar steps to see that their vehicles are properly lit.5. It may often be, however, that the lighting restrictions are used as a pretext by a firm which, for one reason or another, is unwilling to continue nightwork.   In a case of this kind we consider that there should be no hesitation in
employing the sanction available under Defence Regulation 54 C, in accordancewith which the business of the firm may be placed under the control of theProduction Department concerned.Rear lights.6. We were advised that a frequent source of accidents under present condi-tions in the small amount of light allowed for the rear lights of motor vehicles.We consider that in this direction a concession might safely be made. In placeof the present regulations (requiring rear lights to be clearly visible at 30 yards and invisible at 300 yards) there should be substituted a provision that rear lightsmay be used without any of the present restrictions, except that there shall beinserted a single layer of diffusing material, such as tissue paper.Reflector studs.7. We considered a suggestion that, in addition to rear lights, vehicles shouldbe required to have affixed to them on the back one or more reflector studs. Theuse of such studs is already permitted, but we do not recommend that it should bemade compulsory. We consider, however, that a valuable aid to movement at night is provided by reflector studs used to mark the centre of the road. Thefitting of these studs involves considerable expense and some use of steel. Werecommend, however, that their installation on all main roads should be extendedas far as is practicable.Headlights.8. The modifications suggested above, however, would not by themselveslead to a sufficient improvement in the situation. We have therefore considered whether an increased driving light could be allowed on vehicles. The overriding consideration here must be the necessity for a quick change over, should thepresent lull in raiding come to an end. The method adopted therefore should bebased on the restoration of the headlamp, not at present used. If this is done a rapid return to the present style can be obtained by removing the bulb fromthe lamp. The alternatives which we have considered are to allow this lamp tobe used (in addition to the existing masked headlamp) either (a) unmasked or(b) with a mask giving a light of the maximum intensity at present permitted for asingle light. The Ministry of Supply representative on our Committee pressed strongly for the first of these alternatives. The Air Staff consider, however,that there can be no doubt that to allow the use of an unmasked headlamp (the direct light of which is visible as opposed to the light reflected from the ground)would involve a most serious increase in the danger from air attack. Apart fromthis, however, we consider that the use of a single unmasked headlamp would be of doubtful value to drivers themselves, owing to the risk of dazzle. Some simplepractical tests which we carried out on the night of Monday, the 1st September,convinced us that the addition of the second masked headlamp would add greatly to the ease of driving. This view is confirmed by the experience of driversemployed by the London Passenger Transport Board, whose vehicles are alreadypermitted to carry two masked headlamps not together exceeding in intensitythe standards laid down for a single headlamp on other vehicles. We recommend,therefore, that in future vehicles should be permitted to use two headlamps, eachfitted with a mask, giving a light of the maximum intensity at present permittedfor a single headlamp (2-5 foot-candles under the conditions specified in the lighting regulations).9. The view of the Air Staff is that this concession will carry with it anadditional risk. In present conditions, however, we consider that this risk may reasonably be accepted. The Air Staff would be able to advise the War Cabinetpromptly of any change in the scale of air attack to be expected which might makeit necessary for the concession to be withdrawn.Categories of vehicles permitted to relax.10.   Our view is that any concession made must be general.  Not only would it be extremely difficult to decide where to draw the line, but, in addition,discrimination would require an elaborate administrative machinery for the issue[22887] B 2
of permits and frequent checks would be required by the Police to ensure thatthe new lighting was not being used by unauthorised persons. Moreover, it isonly by the general application of these concessions that the maximum advantage in road safety can be obtained.Excepted areas.11. We considered also whether the proposed relaxation should be appliedto certain parts of the country only. The police already have at the present timepower to require the extinction of any light where they consider this is necessary&quot;by reason of hostile attack or the apprehension of such attack.&quot; Chief Con-stables have not hitherto made any extensive use of this power. We do notconsider that there should be a definite provision in the regulations under whichthe second headlamp would be permitted to be used in certain parts of the countryonly. Even if the additional headlamps could be rapidly extinguished, either by removing the bulb or by the use of a separate switch, it would, in our opinion,be impossible to see that this was done by vehicles passing from a permitted toa prohibited area. We recommend, therefore, that the additional lighting-proposed should be permitted throughout the country.111. External Lighting in Ports, &amp;c.12. We have considered the effect on the speed of turn round of ships of the lighting restrictions at present in force in ports. The standards of lighting indocks introduced on the outbreak of war have been kept under continuous review by the Ministry of Home Security and the Departments now merged in theMinistry of War Transport. Since diversion of shipping from the east to thewest coast was introduced, in February 1940, improved lighting has been intro-duced at sixteen ports, including Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol andall South Wales ports. The modifications required to give an increase in lightingso arranged that it could be quickly restored to the present standard would takeconsiderable time and material. Moreover, it seems doubtful whether an improve-ment in the speed of working would be obtained from a still higher standard of lighting.   We do not therefore make any recommendation on this subject.13. It was suggested on behalf of the Admiralty that work in Admiraltydockyards and yards engaged on merchant ship building would be expedited ifthe period of black-out were reduced by allowing lights to be -turned on earlier in the morning, e.g., 1 hour before sunrise. We have not been able in the time at our disposal to obtain sufficient evidence on which to base a conclusion. WeRecommend that this suggestion should be further examined by the Ministry ofHome Security in consultation with the Departments concerned.14. We were also informed that the Postmaster-General would welcome an improvement in lighting conditions at railway stations and Post Office loadingplatforms, particularly in London. The general system of lighting on the rail-ways, including marshalling yards and Post Office loading points, has been inforce since the Spring of 1940. It has, however, been kept under constant review,and schemes for improvement have been constantly devised by a special RailwayLighting Sub-Committee of the Railway Executive Committee, which includesrepresentatives of the Departments concerned. We consider that the representations made by the Postmaster-General might be examined by this sub-Committee.IV. Lighting in Factories.15. We have carefully considered the suggestion put forward to the WarCabinet by the Minister of Supply that authority should be given to his department to continue to operate factories after some slight damage has beendone to the black-out by blast. It was submitted by the Ministry of Supplyrepresentative that the proposal did not involve compulsion on the workpeopleto continue work after the black-out had been damaged. It was urged that the continuation or cessation of work should be a matter for the Ministry of supply to decide by agreement in each case between the management and the work-people. It may be recalled that an extremely successful scheme known as theEmergency Services Oragnisation was brought into operation by the late Ministerof Aircraft Production to assist through local reconstruction panels the rapid
repair of damaged factories. Any damage to the black-out of factories whichcould properly be described as slight would thus result in only a very brief hold-upof production. We consider therefore that the best method of avoiding delays in production, resulting from damage to the black-out in factories, is to ensurethat the necessary repairs are carried out in the shortest possible time with theassistance of the Emergency Services Organisation.16. We are unable to suggest any technical method which would enableproduction to be continued after damage to the black-out without involving seriousrisks to the safety of the factory, its workers and the whole neighbourhood. Theonly alternatives to the strict observance of the lighting restrictions appears tobe to give discretion to the Production Departments to arrange for work to becontinued when the damage to the black-out is not in their opinion serious. Wesuggest, however, that such a discretion could not be given to a single production department even though it were exercised only in consultation with the work-people in the factory concerned. It will be realised that factories engaged on war production, many of them employing large numbers of women, are oftensituated in thickly populated areas in which other industrial interests are concentrated. Individual factories cannot therefore be treated in isolation. Theproposed step might well have a serious effect on the willingness of labour to worknight shifts and the net result might be a decrease in production. After carefulconsideration, therefore, we are unable to suggest any relaxation of the existing regulations governing the lighting of factories. The Ministry of Supplyrepresentative dissents from the views and the recommendation put forward inthis paragraph.Signed on behalf of the Committee :HARCOURT JOHNSTONE, Chairman.Great George Street, S.W. 1,September 3, 1941.
Ministry  of   home security.War Office.Air Ministry.Ministry of Labourand National Ser-vice.The Three supply departments.Ministry of war transport.BLACK-OUT RESTRICTIONS.Minute by the Prime Minister.1. Mr. Harcourt Johnstone will preside over an inter-departmental committee containing representatives of the offices concerned (see margin) for the purpose of devising thebest possible plan for relaxation of the black-out restrictionsduring the present comparative lull in the enemy&apos;s air attack (a) On vehicles required for vital war services, and(6) For factories and ports.The object is to secure the maximum of production for war purposes.2.   The Committee should consider, inter alia (a) The categories of vehicles permitted to relax,(6) The subdued character of the lighting enabling them toproceed at a reasonable speed,ic) The particular routes over which and areas in whichthese relaxations may be especially required by theMinistry of Supply, Ministry of Aircraft Produc-tion and the Admiralty, and, finally,id) The means of speedy return to present style if andwhen this is rendered necessary by enemy action inany district or throughout the country.3. The Committee is to report in one week to the PrimeMinister. All Departments are expected to co-operate in thepublic interest to the utmost. The preparation of the best possible plan must be considered a technical study, and does notnecessarily commit the ministerial heads of the Departmentsconcerned to its adoption. This may be remitted to a Committeeof Ministers on grounds of general policy.W. S. C.August 28, 1941.
