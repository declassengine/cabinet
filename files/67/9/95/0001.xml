Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 95.September 14, 1941.WAR CABINET.COPY OF LETTER FROM DR. WEIZMANN TO THEPRIME MINISTER.Note by the. Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate, for the information ofthe War Cabinet, the attached copy of a letter which he has received fromDr. Weizmann.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Great George Street, S.W.1,September 14, 1941.* * * * * *I wish to thank you for the very kind message which you sent me. I deeplyappreciate it. Still, our position has become so serious, (nay, critical) that I feelI must lay the facts before you by letter if I cannot do so personally.Two years have passed since, on the outbreak of the war, I offered to HisMajesty&apos;s Government, on behalf of the Jewish Agency for Palestine and theJewish people, the fullest active support of the Jews in Palestine and throughoutthe world. A whole year has elapsed since you gave your personal approval toour offer to recruit &apos;&apos; the greatest possible number of Jews in Palestine for thefighting services &quot; and to form &quot; Jewish military units abroad for service in theMiddle East or elsewhere.&quot; But during these two years our readiness to serve hasearned us only rebuffs and humiliations. Even in Palestine, where the need forour services was acknowledged, our most zealous endeavours have not received asingle word of public acknowledgment. Ten thousand Palestinian Jews have fought in Libya, Abyssinia, Greece, Crete and Syria. But our people are nevermentioned; our name is shunned; all contact or co-operation with us is kept darkas if it were compromising.In March last, before I left for the United States, I was given, in a letterfrom the Colonial Secretary, the assurance that the formation of the Jewishfighting force was reluctantly postponed but merely postponed, at the utmostfor six months. I know with what enthusiasm the announcement that it is to be formed at last would be received by our people in Palestine and throughout theworld. But this is not to be, even now. Even in Palestine our people, for whomthe defence of their country and of the British position in the Middle East maybe literally a matter of life and death, are permitted to serve only underhumiliating limitations and conditions.Tortured by Hitler as no nation has even been in modern times, and adver-used by him as his foremost enemy, we are refused by those who fight him the chance of seeing our name and our flag appear among those arrayed against him.[22913]
I know that this exclusion is not in your own intentions or spirit. It is thework of people who were responsible for the Munich policy in Europe and for theWhite Paper in Palestine. We were sacrificed in order to win over the Muftiof Jerusalem and his friends who were serving Hitler in the Middle East; whereas the only thing which can secure the Arabs is British strength in the Middle East,as has been clearly shown in Iraq.But are the Jews so utterly unimportant as the treatment meted put to themsuggests? I have spent four months in America, travelling up and down thecountry, and closely watching the American scene. Forces over there are finelybalanced; the position is uncertain. There is only one big ethnic group whichis willing to stand, to a man, for Great Britain, and a policy of &apos;&apos; all-out-aid &apos;&apos;for her : the five million American Jews. From Secretary Morgenthau, GovernorLehmann, Justice Frankfurter, down to the simplest Jewish workman or trader,they are conscious of all that this struggle against Hitler implies.It has been repeatedly acknowledged by British statesmen that it was theJews who, in the last war, effectively helped to tip the scales in America infavour of Great Britain. They are keen to do it and may do it again. but you are dealing with human beings, with flesh and blood, and the most elementaryfeeling of self-respect sets limits to service, however willing, if the response is nothing but rebuffs and humiliations. American Jewry waits for a word^ a call from His Majesty&apos;s Government. The formation of a Jewish fighting force wouldbe that signal. Equipment cannot be the determining factor : there will always be some alternative use for whatever equipment is available; and fresh recruitsare all the time being called up in the British Commonwealth by their hundreds of thousands, while we are told to wait for one single Division because of lack of equipment. If the spirit of American Jewry is roused, the influence which thiswill exercise on America&apos;s rather sluggish production will return to you thatequipment with manifold gains.Let me feel, Mr. Prime Minister, that our friendship is not spurned on theBritish side, nor our name obliterated at a time when Hitler is endeavouring toobliterate our very existence.******
