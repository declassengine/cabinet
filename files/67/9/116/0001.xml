Printed for the War Cabinet.  September 1941.SECRET.H.D. (41) 20.   (Final.)September 1, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.Home Defence Committee.INVASION PREPARATIONS.REPORT.1. THE Civil Defence Committee, at their meeting on the 16th July,* had before them the Prime Ministers direction that all invasion defences should bebrought to the very highest state of efficiency by the 1st September, and that, inthe meantime, no vigilance should be relaxed. The Committee invited the HomeDefence Committee to review all civil aspects of our preparations.The charter of our Committee, strictly interpreted, does not extend beyondmatters of joint concern to the Services and the civil administration. But duringan invasion there must be interaction between all sides of the life of the nation,and a survey of invasion preparations which stopped short at matters where therewas direct contact between Service operations and civil administration wouldgive an incomplete picture. We have, therefore, included in our survey the plans of civil departments, even where they entail no direct co-ordination with military operations. On the other hand, we have limited the survey strictly toplans devised to meet an invasion.We have brought into our enquiry the civil departments listed in Annex I.The remainder are only concerned in so far as the conditions of work of the staffmay be affected, and will be guided by the instructions issued by the Treasury (see annex IV (ii) ).2. We have looked at the civil preparations in the light of the following assumptions about the probable character and scope of the enemy&apos;s invasionplan :  (a) The main battle must take place where the maximum enemy fighter covercan be given. This area will extend east approximately of a line fromthe Wash to Weymouth, but areas North and West of this line may also be involved.(&amp;) The main objective will probably be London, and the attack may takethe form of a large-scale movement from the east or south-east, or apincer movement from both directions. Many tanks must be expected,and the advance will be carried out ruthlessly and as rapidly aspossible.(c) Diversions may be attempted in other areas, and may come anywhere onthe east or south coasts, possibly as far round as Bristol, and may include Ireland. These attacks will not be in great force, in the firstinstance at any rate.Copy No.   225[22879]* C.D.C. (41) 27th Meeting, Conci. 2 (b).b
(i) Fighter Command aerodromes,(ii) Areas immediately in the rear of bridgeheads.(iii) Areas through which reserves would have to move.(iv) London.It is doubtful whether the enemy will attempt all four at once.In terms of civil invasion plans this picture means that there will be a&quot; front &quot; area in which sea-borne invasion is being resisted and in which fighting-ion a heavy scale is going on over a considerable area. Here, though civil lifeI will not be impossible, it will at best be a hand-to-mouth existence. Behind this area there will be an area in which there will be heavy bombing of communications and descents of airborne troops in large numbers. Production, and maintenanceof civilian services, will be seriously interrupted. Behind this there will be large areas, relatively free from enemy action, apart from isolated incidents, in whichit should be possible for production to be maintained, and even to be increased bythe determination of every man and woman to leave nothing undone to defeat theenemy.3. Before dealing with the plans submitted to us we have some general observations to make. We are strongly of the opinion that, though general policy must be laid down at the centre, and however necessary it may be for departments of State to control the operations of their regional representatives before invasioncomes, when it does come the responsibility for operations should rest upon theauthorities in the areas threatened. Even if this were not right in principle, therisk of a breakdown of communications with Whitehall would make it essentialto provide for it. On the other hand, it is the responsibility of the GovernmentDepartment concerned to satisfy itself that the preparations agreed upon in whitehall are made effective by their regional and other local representatives in good time. We recognise the difficulty of ensuring that every unit in the relativelyloosely-knit civil organisation is familiar with and practised in the part he willhave to play in invasion, but we attach great importance to the point and recommend that departments should review their plans from this point of view.The principle that the preparations now to be considered should be suchas can in emergency be put into effect in areas subject to the emergency entailsnot only the determination in advance of the authorities in those areas who areto exercise the various poAvers, but the arrangement of adequate liaison betweenthem. On the civil side this has been worked out in a scheme based on the centralrole of the Regional Commissioner in his area. But in the hazards and chances of a threatened area the action of civil authorities must depend closely uponmilitary information and judgment of the situation; and on the other handmilitary operations, big and little, will depend on full co-operation between themilitary and civil authorities and may be affected by the right handling of thecivil population. Therefore we think it important that civil authorities of allgrades should know who are their &quot; opposite numbers &quot; on the military side and vice versa; and that, so far as possible, they should have made each other&apos;sacquaintance in advance of the time when everything may depend on mutual confidence. It will be seen from Annex II (i), paragraph 3, that steps have already lybeen taken by the Commander-in-Chief and the Ministry of Home Security tosecure this essential contact, and we recommend that it should be fostered on bothsides. We feel that the plans which we deal with below, at any rate the plansdepending on co-operation between Home Forces and the civil side, may lose their value failing the personal contact which we recommend. The purpose wehave in mind can, we believe, be furthered by carrying out exercises, whichshould be as realistic as possible, to test the contacts which it is intended toestablish and to determine clearly where the responsibilities will fall when theday comes.It might be possible to go further. There is evidence that the ordinary manwould be happier if he had a job assigned to him when the emergency comes or,failing a definite job, if he were told how best he could assist the defence. Apartfrom the general information of the &quot; Beating the Invader &quot; and other leaflets,no instructions are possible from the centre. But localities in threatened areasmust have problems of their own in face of attack, and, given liaison between
military and civil officers, directions to the people of small towns and villagesmight well be a matter for forethought and arrangement locally. We understand,indeed that much has been done on these lines between No. 12 Region andS.E. Command and in Nos. 4, 6 and 7 Regions local parish &quot; invasioncommittees &quot; representing all local interests have been set up. (See Annex II;paragraph 4).4. Having regard to the variety and detail of the subject matter we have proceeded as far as possible by way of subsidiary committees comprising repre-sentatives of the offices directly concerned in particular questions. In this waythe plans made during the past year have been subjected to a detailed scrutiny;gaps have been filled in and loose ends tied up. We have examined the reportsof these committees and incorporated them in our survey with such commentsor amendments as we thought useful.For convenience we have grouped our subject matter under four mainheads : (a) Specific assistance to the military and co-operation between the civil andmilitary authorities.   (Annex II.)(b) Denial of resources to the enemy.  (Annex III.)(c) Maintenance of civil war effort.   (Annex IV.)(d) Maintenance of civil life.   (Annex V.)There are alternative ways of grouping items under these heads. thus the primary purpose of compulsory evacuation is to remove a danger to our military operations, but from a civil point of view the scheme would fall withinthe head &quot; Maintenance of Civil Life.&quot; Some of the items included under thelast two heads, &quot; Maintenance of the Civil War Effort &quot; and &quot; Maintenance ofCivil Life&apos;&apos; might appear indifferently under one or the other since, in general,steps taken to sustain the war effort assist also to maintain civil life. We have arranged our subject matter broadly in the order of its importance for repellingthe enemy.5. The plans which have been presented to us by the Civil Departments areoutlined in Annexes II to V inclusive, under the four heads given above. Wehave examined them with the assistance of representatives of the Departmentsconcerned, and, subject to certain agreed amendments which have been incorporated, we are satisfied that they are adequate for their purpose and thatthere is no matter of importance which has not been covered. In some casesplans are not yet agreed in every detail. These are indicated by side lines, andif our report is accepted, it will rest with the Departments concerned to see thatthey are completed as soon as may be.In a few cases we have ventured to make suggestions for consideration.These will be found in paragraphs 19, 69, 73, 78 and 92 of Annexes II to V.6. There is one matter not elsewhere covered to which, by reason of its importance, we would invite attention. This concerns the necessity for securing that the labour employed by contractors, which is to be diverted to urgent militaryworks in &quot; operational &quot; areas, is mobilised and moved with speed and certainty.(See Annex II, paragraph 16).At present the powers available are two: (a) Under Defence Regulation 16a Regional Commissioners have power to direct individuals to comply with orders &apos;&apos; for the purpose of meetingor hindering any actual or apprehended attack by the enemy.&quot;(b) Under Defence Regulation 58a National Service Officers are empoweredto direct individuals to perform such services as they are capable ofperforming.Neither of these provisions is suitable for the purpose in view. regional commissioners have no machinery under Regulation 16a, through which direc-tions can be issued to considerable groups of men at short notice, and the penalty for non-compliance with the Regulation is not of a kind which will secure the prompt action which is essential in the emergencies contemplated, e.g., the clearance of a road for the passage for an armoured division. The penaltyunder Regulation 58a is the same and, as the primary purpose of that Regulationis to enable men to be transferred from one industrial job to another, the[22879] B 2
Ministry of Labour would not be prepared to use it for the quite different purposeof providing pioneer labour in a threatened area.The solution may lie in taking powers, by legislation, if necessary, based onthe most suitable features of the above provisions, with more stringent penalties.The enactment might empower the Regional Commissioner, after consultation withthe C.-in-C. or the G.O.C.-in-C. Command, to declare &quot;a state of emergency ina prescribed &apos;&apos; operational&apos;&apos; zone. This declaration would empower suitablychosen civil officers to place individuals or bodies of men under the orders of themilitary as reinfoi&apos;cements for pioneer work (but not for combatant duties). Werecommend that the problem should be further considered on some such lines.It will be necessary to provide for pay and compensation in the event of injury or death. As regards compensation for injury and death, the rates atpresent in force for civil defence workers (which are roughly comparable withthose applicable to private soldiers) might be adopted. We recommend that ascheme on these lines should be discussed by the Departments concerned.On behalf of the Committee :(Signed) S. F. STEWART, Chairman.September 1, 1941.

Two signals will be issued by Home Forces to the formations under theircommand, (a) &quot; Stand to &quot; and (b) &quot; Action Stations.&quot;&quot;Stand, to&quot; indicates that conditions are particularly favourable for an invasion. The troops receiving it will at once come to a complete state of readiness, but Home Guard will not be called out except for special purposes asordered by the General Officers Commanding-in-Chief, Commands.&quot;Action Stations&quot; indicates an immediate threat of invasion. It is thesignal for the calling out of the Home Guard and the taking up by the militaryauthorities of the necessary telephone and telegraph lines.These messages will be issued to the Commands immediately concerned for action and will be repeated to other Commands and formations for information.The Chief Civil Staff Officer to the Commander-in-Chief will issue bothsignals to the Civil Departments, direct in the case of certain offices, and throughthe Treasury in the case of others. It will be made clear to which areas thesignals have been issued for action on the military side. Departmental &quot; WarBooks &quot; have been prepared setting out the action required at each stage.The Ministry of Home Security will issue the messages to Regional Commis-sioners by whom they will be distributed to Chief Constables, A.R.P. Controllers,and the Regional representatives of Government Departments.The military plans for the defence of London in the event of airborne attackwill involve a large-scale stoppage of traffic. A special public signal has there fore been devised to denote an immediate threat to the Capital; on this1-23-45-67-1112-14151617181920-2122232425-26272829
signal all road traffic except military civil defence and repair vehicles on urgentbusiness, and transport for essential telephone personnel, will stop until such time as the G.O.C., London District, has decided in what direction the attack will come and has made the necessary military dispositions. Pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists may continue to move. The signal will be cancelled by local police action and possibly broadcast announcement. The meaning of the signal will be fully explained to the public by an announcement at a suitable opportunity beforehand.2.   To complete the picture we set out below the Admiralty and R.A.F. code of invasion signals.A dmiralty.&quot; First degree of readiness.&quot; Invasion is imminent and attack is likelyto occur within the next twelve hours.&quot; Second degree of readiness.&quot; The enemy is in every respect preparedfor invasion, and it is considered likely that attack will take place withinthe next three days.&quot; Third degree of readiness.&quot; The enemy is preparing for invasion,but attack is not expected in the next three days.Note.-The Admiralty &quot; Standstill &quot; order to shipping is not a degree of readiness but an operational order to ships caught at sea afterinvasion has begun.Royal Air Force.&quot; Invasion Alert No. 1.&quot; Attack is regarded as imminent and likely to occur within the next twelve hours.&quot; Invasion Alert No. 2.&quot; Attack is regarded as probable within thefollowing three days.&quot; Invasion Alert No. 3.&quot;   Attack is regarded as improbable within the -following three days, although an invasion threat is believed to exist.These codes cannot be exactly correlated with the military code, but they can have no bearing on civil preparations and will not be communicated to civil authorities. We are satisfied that no confusion is likely to result from the employ -ment of different codes by the three services.Machinery of Co-operation.3.   Contact between the two sides -was established last year at the centre.During invasion the Chief Civil Staff Officer would : &apos;(a) in the light of messages from the various civil offices concerned in operations present to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, informa-tion regarding :  (i) the civil situation.(ii) any measures taken or proposed to be taken by civil authorities which may affect military operations.(b) pass to the Civil Departments the needs and requests of Home Forces.(c) be the medium through which staffs of Civil Departments and Servicesand staffs of G.H.Q., Home Forces, would communicate with eachother. (In a few special instances, Civil Departments communicate with Home Forces direct.)At the Regional level contact is maintained between the Regional Commis-sioner and the Command and Corps within his Region through a military liaison officer stationed at Regional Headquarters. In addition, direct telephone line shave been installed between Regions and Commands other than Northern Com-mand and Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Regions. These Regions are in direct touch with lowerformations of the Command. In the case of Scotland, the Regional Commissioneris located at Edinburgh, which is also the Command Headquarters.Below Command and Regional level the contacts might be on some suchplan as is set out below. But it must be left to the Commands, in consultationwith the Regional Commissioners, to make such modifications in these arrange-ments as are required by local conditions.
A link might be provided between the Division or military Area on the onehand and the Police and Ministries of War Transport and Food on the other.The Police link already exists. The Division or Area is probably the most useful level between the Command and the Unit for liaison with the civil side.A Police link already exists with Brigades and Sub-areas in most cases, andthis is regarded as sufficient.The Unit Commanders might deal directly with Chief Constables, A.R.P.Controllers and Chief Officers of Fire Brigades, or their subordinates, on policematters, civil defence and fire fighting respectively. Where it is necessary toget into touch with the local authority on matters not falling within the province of the A.R.P. Controller, the necessary approach might be made through theA.R.P. Controller.There should be a clear understanding as to the officer concerned with police,civil defence or fire brigade matters respectively, with whom a military corn-man der should get into touch in any town or village; and lists of these officersmight be made available to the military authorities.4. Village Defence Committees. In some villages in Rural Districts itmay be desirable to set up a Defence Committee consisting, e.g., of a chairman(normally the chairman of the Parish Council or Parish Meeting), the local foodofficer, the local Home Guard Commander, the senior A.R.P. warden, a memberof the first aid parties and the senior local police officer. The purpose of thiscommittee will be to examine preparations on the civil side for invasion and toconsider how the general scheme of preparedness can best be applied in their ownarea. The committee will have no executive authority and will be engagedprimarily in preparatory work in advance of an invasion; for example, the localfood officer, to whom the Divisional Food Officer will in practice have delegatedhis powers, will in no sense be subject to the committee&apos;s directions and will notbe permitted to pass on his responsibility for local food control to them. under conditions of active operations the military authorities would deal direct withthe various officials represented on the committee. It is not necessary or desirableto set up committees in larger urban areas.Where the Regional Commissioner and the Army Commander so desire, anofficer will be designated in towns and large villages in areas likely to be threatened by invasion who will act as liaison officer between the military and civil authorities. So far as is practicable, efforts will be made to secure that thisofficer is not moved about more than is absolutely necessary.This officer will be the normal channel of communication between the militaryauthorities below the Command level and the local civil authorities; where heis not appointed, local military commanders will perform the same functions.Pooling of Medical Resources.5. Co-operation in regard to Emergency Medical and Casualty Services. All civil and military resources, including medical officers, nurses, orderlies andexpendable stores, will be pooled. Civilian hospitals will continue to function ascasualty hospitals, even in an area of military operations, and will continue to be operated by civilian personnel. They will deal with Service casualties and will act with such military hospitals as are available, both as casualty clearing andbase hospitals for forces engaged.To make this possible, hospitals in the zones affected will be cleared of allpatients able to be transferred elsewhere or to go home, and if all reserves are brought into play a total of over 300,000 beds will be available in the country asa whole (including Scotland). Included in this number are some 80,000 beds in public schools and other institutions, for which staff would largely have tobe improvised. Skeleton medical and surgical equipment is available in the regions for these reserves to enable them to carry on, and fuller equipment willbe provided for those actually brought into use, either from stores or fromevacuated hospitals.It is contemplated that it may become necessary in areas where there are many casualties^ to reinforce the casualty services by Army Medical Officersattached to static units. Civilian doctors are being individually allocated forthis and other medical duties which the situation is likely to require, and seniorRegional Officers of the Ministry of Health have been furnished with powers ofNational Service Officers to issue formal directions if necessary; Hospital Officersof the Department of Health for Scotland also have these powers.
6. Clearance of Coastal Hospitals. Coastal hospitals in vulnerable areas are kept partly empty in order to lighten the task of removing patients when theoccasion arises, and to keep a considerable margin of beds for casualties requiringtreatment before the clearance has been completed. The proportion of empty bedsvaries from time to time in the light of circumstances. At present, in Kent andSussex hospitals 50 per cent, of the beds are empty; elsewhere the figure is25 per cent.Detailed instructions have been issued for the removal of patients, staff and,so far as circumstances permit, equipment to meet the possibility that certainhospitals may have to be abandoned.Joint Anti-Gas Measures.7. Procedure to establish that gas has been used. On the civil side thelocal Gas Identification Officer (of whom there are some 1,500) would, in the caseof first gas attack, call in the Senior Regional Gas Adviser attached to the civil defence Region. This Officer would make his report direct to the Ministry ofHome Security. Arrangements have been made for close liaison, in order toestablish that gas has been used (a) between the Regions, Army Commands andCorps Headquarters, and (b) between the Ministry of Home Security and theDirector of Chemical Warfare, Home Forces.Gas Officers have been appointed in some Admiralty Establishments, but these officers have no formal contact with the Local Civil Defence organisation,except where the Admiral in charge of the establishment is also the local A.R.P.Controller. The reports of these officers will be transmitted to the Admiralty, and thence to G.H.Q., Home Forces. The Air Force have no separate gas identification-tion service, and rely on the services of Civil Defence Gas Identification Officers.In some cases, e.g., in Scotland, where R.A.F. Stations are situated some distance from the Headquarters of existing Gas Identification Officers, special appoint-ments have been made.When the first use of gas has been established, the Ministry of Home Securitywill release anti-gas publicity for the protection of the civil population.Responsibility for issuing this publicity rests on the Minister of Home Security.Considerable publicity has already been given to the need for precautions against possible gas attacks.If gas is first used by the enemy in connection with an attempt at invasion,the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, may wish fu take retaliatory measuresvery quickly. Under present arrangements the Commander-in-Chief would report the facts to the War Cabinet through the Secretary of State for War andwould seek authority for retaliation.8. Cloud Gas from the Sea. Such attacks are the concern both of themilitary and the civil authorities. Responsibility for the initial warning hasbeen undertaken by the Army, but dissemination of the warning by rattles in coastal towns is the duty of the Civil Defence Services.9. Cleansing. Arrangements have been made whereby contaminatedmembers of the Services away from their units, and also isolated Service units(balloon barrage and anti-aircraft crews), can use public Cleansing Centres, whilemembers of the public will be admitted to Service Cleansing Stations. In both cases arrangements are made for re-clothing.10. Supplies of Bleaching Powder. A proposal is at present being con-sidered to enable the nearest available supplies of bleaching powder to be drawn upon in an emergency by any service whether it is held by local authorities or by service units.11. Unexploded Gas Bombs. Instructions have been issued to the police and Civil Defence Services on reporting suspected unexploded gas bombs. Assoon as a report is received, a Bomb Disposal Intelligence Officer will be sent toexamine the suspected bomb and a Gas Identification Officer will accompany himto identify its contents. If the bomb is confirmed as an unexploded gas bomb, itwill immediately be sent for examination by experts and details will.be issued to the Services for identification purposes as soon as possible.[22879] c
(ii) Maintenance of Essential Military Communications and Facilities.Telecommunications.12. The main assistance given by the Post Office to the Forces has been inthe provision of communications for operational and other needs; and duringthe past year there has been a large growth in the network of telephone andteleprinter communications connecting the War Office and G.H.Q. Home forces with Commands, Commands with Corps and Corps with Divisions. at every level lateral communications also have been provided, together withcommunications to R.A.F. formations, Regional Commissioners, &amp;c.Three main locations for G.H.Q. Home Forces are equipped on an elaboratescale and smaller systems of lines serve two other locations.New or alternative Headquarters have been equipped for nearly everyCommand and Corps. In the Eastern and South-Eastern Commands, the variousCorps have been provided with more elaborate networks than G.H.Q. has considered necessary elsewhere; and throughout the country arrangements existfor additional lines to be brought into use upon the issue of the message &apos;&apos; ActionStations &quot; to serve existing Headquarters and also those to which formationsmight expect to move under invasion conditions. The R.A.F. and A.A. Commandhave a similar elaborate network for operational communications.A &quot; Defence Teleprinter Network &quot; linking up many of their establishmentsfor operation and administrative purposes has been provided for the use of thethree Defence Services. It is being expanded to include additional establish-ments as they become available. When complete the network will be for all practical purposes a duplicate of the public telegraph system.Army Signal Units have co-operated in completing the networks mentionedabove, and have gained experience in Post Office engineering methods and in thejoint use of Post Office and Army types of lines and equipment.A number of towns, where bombing might be expected to interrupt permanent military communications, have been by-passed with small Army cables for usein that event : and extensive cabling works have been undertaken in the South-Eastern part of the country to obviate interruptions due to this cause.In active operations the main task of the Post Office will be the provision of communications between mobile columns, which may consist of one or moreBrigades, and their Divisional Headquarters; also between a larger forceoperating against a sea-borne landing and its next superior formation. To avoid any delay it has been arranged that these communications shall be provided by thedirection of specially appointed liaison officers from the Post Office who arescheduled to take up duty with Commands in the event of active operations.These officers will work in close co-operation with the Command Chief SignalsOfficer and the Officers Commanding Divisional Signals, and instructions havebeen given throughout the Post Office organisation that the highest priorityis to be given to their requirements. They have already, in some cases, parti-cipated in Command Exercises, and the value of the arrangement has been amplydemonstrated. The Post Office attaches much importance to their inclusion inany future Exercises.Elaborate alternative routeing arrangements exist in the main Post Officenetwork for Admiralty, Air Force and War Office, G.H.Q. and Commandcommunications. Additional requirements of this character which might befound to be necessary will be provided by the Post Office when the need arisesby appropriating public trunk circuits.13. Passing Information to the Forces. The importance of passing withoutdelay to the military and police authorities any intelligence regarding the movements of the enemy which may come to notice has been fully appreciated;and Post Office staff throughout the country has been instructed accordingly.14. Overseas Cable and Radio Services. These are operated in the mainfrom the offices of Cable and Wireless Limited, Electra House, Embankment,and of the Western Union and Commercial Cable Companies in the City. a service is also available for certain countries from the Central Telegraph Office.If any of these buildings is destroyed by bombing or fire, services can be main-tained for essential Government communications from reserve offices which havebeen provided and equipped in the suburbs. Service can also be given in the last resort from the cable heads and radio stations.
Railways.15. In acute emergency it may be necessary to give troops, e.g., those recalledfrom leave, priority over civilian passengers on public services. Accordingly,railway officials will be instructed to detrain civilian passengers to make room for troops, invoking military assistance if required. It is hoped, however, that such measures will be unnecessary, for the Railways will take all possible steps to meetimmediate demands for troop movement by other means.The Ministry of War Transport will work in close contact with the MovementControl Branch of the War Office, and will impose such restrictions on civilianmovement as are necessary to facilitate military operations (see Annex IV,paragraphs 50-54). In certain areas it may be necessary to continue runningessential civil trains, e.g., ambulance trains, after the suspension of all public services until the lines can no longer be kept open.Arrangements for repair of damage which have worked well in periods ofintense air raids will continue. In invasion first priority for repair andmaintenance will be given to main trunk routes. Lines of secondary importanceproviding alternative routes and feeding service depots and railheads will havesecond priority.   Emergency stocks of rails, timber and girders are available.The selection and classification of routes is based primarily on operational requirements and has been agreed with the three Service Departments. account has, however, been taken as far as possible of civil requirements. arrangements have been made for co-operation between the railway authorities and the militaryfor the best use of the labour available for the repair of damage.War Stations have been allotted to Railway Transportation units whichenable them to cover important railway routes. If additional labour is needed,assistance will be forthcoming from the Pioneer Corps. Unskilled military labourmay be provided so far as it is available to assist in cases of extreme urgency forsuch jobs as the unloading of trucks at railway goods stations. Normally,however, civilian labour would be obtained through the Ministry of Labour&apos;s localorganisation.Schemes for improving telephone communications on the railways are inhand. A scheme for providing 95 wireless installations has also been approved,and 31 operating stations have been, or are being established.Roads and Works.16.   The intensive  aerial  bombardment,  which  it  is  anticipated  willaccompany any attempt at invasion may be expected to result in substantialdamage and dislocation.   Labour will be required to clear debris from essential[22879] c 2The principal Government Departments requiring overseas service are linked with the Cable Companies by direct teleprinter circuits. If the main Londonoffices of the Companies were destroyed, the Post Office, together with theCompanies, will organise arrangements for the conveyance of telegrams from london to the point from which temporary service will be operated.The maintenance of the links between London and the cable heads and radio stations has been safeguarded as far as possible by the provision of alternativeroutes in the inland telegraph and telephone cable network.The services are normally given partly by radio and partly by submarinecable. If any or all of the submarine cables are cut at sea, sufficient radio capacityhas already been provided to enable essential communications to be carried. the capacity of the radio stations is, however, being enlarged to give a greater margin of safety.The radio stations themselves are in widely separated localities, so that therisk of their total capacity being seriously reduced is small. If some of them were destroyed, the remaining capacity would suffice to carry essential Governmentcommunications. Extension of the system, providing additional reserve stations,is, however, being carried out.Arrangements have been made for the transmission of the &apos;&apos; Stand to &apos;&apos; and&quot; Action Station &quot; messages, when received, to the Cable and Wireless, western union and Commercial Cable Companies, in order to enable them to put theirstaffing, &amp;c, arrangements on an emergency footing.
lines of communication and to assist in repair work necessary for the continuanceof essential services.The resources of the local organisation of the Ministry of Labour will beavailable for the provision of miscellaneous labour for the filling of bomb cratersand similar unskilled work. There are at local offices of the Ministry of Labour,National Service Officers, who have been authorised by the Minister of Labour,under the Defence Regulations, to direct individuals as necessary to undertakespecific services, and the Ministry is collaborating with the. military authoritiesand the Ministry of Works and Buildings in the use of these powers underinvasion conditions. Steps have been taken to ensure that the number of NationalService Officers is adequate.So far as concerns the repair of roads, Highway Authorities will continue to function, but it cannot be expected that with their limited resources they will beable to carry on unaided. Arrangements have, therefore, been made under which men employed by the Ministry of War Transport on Agency Service works willbe grouped into suitable mobile units in backward areas with equipment andtransport, to carry out urgent road repairs. Representatives of Divisional RoadEngineers of the Ministry of Transport will be stationed at Corps Headquarterson &apos;&apos; Action Stations &apos;&apos; to facilitate the working of the scheme.Where the resources of this organisation for the needs of an emergencysituation are exhausted, application for assistance will be made by the corps commander to a representative of the Ministry of Works and Buildings at his headquarters. The labour under the control of the Ministry is mainlycontractors&apos; labour, and the Ministry&apos;s local representative, the Assistant Directorof Emergency Works, who will be with the Regional Commissioner, will meet the corps Commander&apos;s requirements. He has the necessary information and powers for this purpose. This organisation is, of course, available to Corps Commandersfor other works, e.g., the erection of defence works.Close liaison will be maintained between the Corps Military Commanders and road Engineers and Emergency Works Officers so that the civil officials may beapprised of the vulnerable points and can make their dispositions to the best advantage.Calls may, of course, be made on the Emergency Works organisation by other service and Civil Departments; in particular the Air Ministry may makedemands for the repair of aerodromes. Service requirements will have first priority, and the Corps Commander will determine priorities within this class.Regional Commissioners will decide questions of priority as between civil departments.In the last resort, when conditions in any area are such that it is impossiblefor civilians to work on the roads, the military will take over the work of clearanceand repair.Petroleum Products.17. Under plans approved by the Oil Control Board for the importation,storage and distribution of supplies of aviation fuel, petrol, fuel oil, &amp;c, the petroleum Board, formed by the industry to co-ordinate its activities during thewar, are responsible for the imports of aviation fuel, for the maintenance ofAir Ministry storages and for distributing all aviation fuel required by theRAP. up to the point of consumption on the forward aerodromes. In collabora-tion with the War Office, the Board import and maintain stocks of petrol inWar Office storages, and also deliver some supplies from civil stocks into garagesrequisitioned by the War Office. Other services are rendered by the Board as requested by the War Office. The Admiralty rely upon the services of the board to maintain supplies of fuel to Torpedo Boats and Motor Launches. the petroleum Board, which works in close collaboration with the Petroleum Depart-ment, will continue to be responsible for these services in the event of invasion.Food for the Home Guard.18. Present arrangements provide that, where necessary, two days&apos; food forthe Home Guard will be provided from military sources after they have beenmustered for operational duty. This will be supplemented by a 24 hours&apos;haversack ration which the man will be instructed to bring with him.   Thereafter
Home Guard may be fed from their own homes, by the military where they are fighting side by side with the Regular Army, or in messes registered by home guard units as catering establishments.Where the last means is adopted the mess will be registered by the LocalFood Control Committee and authority given for the purchase of food fromcivilian sources. Food Executive Officers have been instructed to render allpossible assistance to Home Guard Commanders to ensure the smooth workingof the arrangements generally.To meet the special needs of units in isolated areas where there may bebreakdown of the normal system of distribution, the War Office are distributingto the Home Guard from Army stocks reserves of staple foodstuffs sufficient tocover seven days&apos; consumption; the Ministry of Food will replace, under thenormal supply procedure, the quantities of foodstuffs used for this purpose.(iii) Enforcement of Stand-Firm Policy and Control of Civilian Movements.Invasion Propaganda.19. Three leaflets of instructions to the public have been issued, the first two entitled &quot;Stay Where You Are&quot; and &quot;If the Invader Comes&quot; issued inthe Summer of last year, and the third &quot; Beating the Invader,&quot; issued in april last with a foreword by the Prime Minister. All these pamphlets, which were distributed to every household in the country, emphasised the importance of the&quot; stand firm &quot; policy. The latter stressed also that as far as possible the civilpopulation should carry on with its normal duties. As a corollary to the&quot; Beating the Invader &quot; leaflet, the Ministry of Home Security have issuedconfidential instructions to wardens and the police amplifying the instuctions in the leaflet.It is realised, however, that the effect of propaganda of this kind must betransitory unless it coincides with events which will drive home its lessons. Forthis reason it is felt that when invasion is imminent a second edition of the&quot; Beating the Invader &quot; pamphlet must be ready for instant issue to tJhe public.There is little practical difficulty in arranging for its issue through the PostOffice, at short notice. It is proposed, therefore, that, as soon as the month&apos;notice of invasion envisaged by the Chiefs of Staff has been given, a secondedition of the pamphlet, with any necessary modifications, should be prepared,printed and distributed down to post offices, so that copies can be delivered bypostmen at short notice.In addition to specific instructions there is need for continuous propaganda to make the public &quot; invasion conscious.&quot; There is evidence that the public isnot yet aware of the forms which invasion is likely to take. For example, it isgenerally believed that invasion will be attempted only by sea, and people in theMidlands do not sufficiently appreciate the danger that may arise from airborneattack. It is therefore important that the risk should be kept before the public.Invasion exercises are particularly valuable, especially those which are held inco-operation with civil defence services and in which the public themselves take part, not least because they inculcate a sense of discipline in all concerned. Thereis, however, need, for further measures. Feature articles, illustrated wherever possible, broadcasts and films would be helpful. The Ministry of InformationJ are faking steps to encourage the issue of propaganda on these lines.Compulsory Evacuation Schemes.20. Plans were prepared last summer for the compulsory evacuation, uponthe threat of invasion, of 19 coastal towns between Hythe and Great Yarmouth.These plans were reviewed in the Spring of this year by a Committee of Ministerspresided over by the Lord President and it was decided that similar plans shouldbe prepared for a further 8 towns on the Kent and Sussex coasts (as far Westas Newhaven) and the inland towns of Ipswich, Colchester, Canterbury andAshford. Consideration was given to the inclusion of Brighton in the scheme,but the time needed to evacuate, about 8 days, was considered to make thisimpracticable.The revised plans provide for the operation being carried out either in two stages, with an interval between, or as a whole.   The first stage (Stage A),
designed to be operated, if the War Cabinet so direct, as soon as preparations for invasion are known to be on foot, would provide for the removal of thefollowing classes : Compulsory (a) Children aged between 5 and 14 years.Voluntary -(b) Schoolchildren over 14.(c) Mothers of schoolchildren who wish to accompany them.(d) Children under 5, accompanied by their mothers or other femalestaking charge of them.In pursuance of Directions given by the Regional Commissioners ofRegions 4 and 12, under Regulation 16a of the Defence (General) Regulations,1939, children between the ages of 5 and 14 years in the 31 towns were registeredby the Local Authorities between the 23rd and 28th June. Other children andwomen with children eligible for evacuation at Stage A, and desiring to be evacuated at that stage, were registered at the same time.The second stage (Stage B), designed to be operated when invasion isimminent, provides for the removal of the remainder of the population exceptessential personnel required to remain behind.Railway time-tables providing for the removal to pre-arranged receivingareas of the whole of the evacuable populations have been ready for operationsince the 15th June, and the receiving Local Authorities have been warned tobe prepared for the Scheme to operate at any time.Detailed instructions have been issued to the evacuating and receiving localauthorities for the separate operation of Stage A, independently of the others.It may be added that the question has recently been raised as to whether thosecoastal and inland towns which are also nodal points, and are thus of particular importance to the military (see paragraph 23, below), should be evacuated inadvance of the others.   This is under consideration.The marshalling and entraining arrangements for Stage B, and also for theoperation of the scheme as a whole, if that should be ordered, are under thecontrol of the police. For the operation of Stage A as a separate movement theLocal Authorities in the evacuation areas will be responsible, with such help asmay be required from the police.   (See also Annex V, paragraph 88.)The speed of operation, and consequently the success of these plans, dependslargely on the numbers to be lifted. Accordingly, in the Spring and early Summerlocal publicity was undertaken to persuade people to evacuate voluntarily. the target aimed at was to reduce the population of the towns concerned to 60 per cent,of the pre-war figure. The following figures show the position at the end ofJuly :-Population Statistics for Towns in Special Evacuation SchemeJuly 1941.Total Pre-warPopulation.Population remainingon 31st July.Net change of Population during month ofJ une.July.436,350461,982EAST ANGLIA.272,265KENT and SUSSEX.219,355106(increase)734(decrease)29(increase)479(decrease)

Retention of &quot; Nucleus.&quot; It will not be desirable completely to emptythe towns covered by the compulsory evacuation scheme. In addition to theHome Guard and certain other services, such as the Royal Observer Corps andthe Coastguards, a civilian nucleus will have to be left to maintain such civilianservices as are necessary to the Armed Forces of the Crown defending the area,and for essential civil purposes, e.g., the continuance of electricity supply whichis distributed to outlying areas, and the care and maintenance of the larger gasundertakings which could not be safely left unattended. The total number of civilians retained will be of the order of 4 or 5 per cent, of the total population.The Regional Commissioner will issue directions under Defence Regulation 16arequiring those chosen to remain to stay in their town in the event of the compul-sory evacuation of the rest of the town. The questions of pay and messing forthis nucleus remain to be decided.Refugee Emergency Services.22. The leaflet &quot; Beating the Invader,&quot; and other propaganda put out fromtime to time, has emphasised the importance of standing firm in an area which isbeing attacked. It will be the duty of the police to make people stay where theyare and not seek refuge elsewhere. In this matter they will have such military assistance as can be given.To assist the police in performing their duties in this matter it is proposedthat, on or after &quot; Action Stations,&quot; Regional Commissioners should delegate tothe police powers under Defence Regulation 16a to require persons on foot orin vehicles to obey instructions as to their movements in certain circumstances.If, in spite of the action taken, a refugee movement develops, it will be controlled by the police, again with such military help as can be given. Subject tolocal circumstances and to military necessities, the movement may be directed toentraining stations which have been earmarked for the purpose in advance andfrom which trains will be run to regulating stations and thence to reception areas.The list covers the larger towns in the coastal areas on the East and South ofEngland, as far West at Bognor, and the East of Scotland, together with a fewinland towns in specially vulnerable areas, e.g.s Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester,Chelmsford, Canterbury and Ashford.In view of the unanimous opinion of the Army Commanders and regional commissioners concerned that, after operations have begun, conditions in the regions will make regulated rail movements for these Emergency services quite impracticable, no plans have been prepared for the remainder of the 31 townsscheduled for compulsory evacuation (except Southend, where special considera-tions apply) and Hastings, Bexhill, Eastbourne and Newhaven.As its name implies, the scheme is an emergency one, and it is not intended that plans for food, transport and shelter comparable with those provided in thecase of the Compulsory Evacuation Scheme should be made. A detailed plan would probably break down in the conditions contemplated, and any attempt to adhere to it might only stifle initiative. Refugees will have to endure rough-and-ready treatment and plans must largely be improvised.Secrecy in regard to the existence of the scheme is vital, since the &quot; stand firm &quot; policy would be seriously undermined if information about the existenceof the plans got about. Accordingly, stringent precautions against leakage havebeen taken, and the existence of plans has been communicated only to the fewsenior local officials responsible for their operation.Effect of Visitors&apos; Ban and Evacuation of School Children on thePopulation of the Brighton Towns
If rail transport should break down and refugees be left in large numbersat entraining points, an attempt will be made to break up the mass of people bydispersal and by filtering off groups to neighbouring towns (see also Annex V(para. 89)).Nodal Points.23. The Military authorities have selected a number of towns, villages andcross-roads in Eastern, South-Eastern and Southern England which they propose,to make strong points in their defences.In nodal points, other than the smallest, the civil population will have to stand firm, and provision is being made for additional shelter facilities, stocksof food and augmented civil defence services. Special attention is being paidto the provision of fire-fighting equipment, and the fire-fighting services in thelarger nodal points will be increased by bringing in and retaining reinforcements from surrounding areas.  As regards water supplies, see Annex V (para. 82).In some cases the population outside the perimeter of the defences will haveto be evacuated and housed in protected accommodation inside the defences. Ina few of the smallest nodal points, where shelter accommodation is not easilyprovided, they will have to disperse in the neighbouring countryside.Provision for compulsory fire watching is being made in places regarded bythe military as important centres for operational communications.Control of Refugee Movements.24. Refugee movements may arise which cannot be controlled at the source,either as a result of panic or because bombing and fire have forced people fromtheir homes. In the larger towns the Refugee Emergency Schemes may provepracticable. No provision on these lines has been made or could be made for thesmaller towns in the vulnerable areas or in rural districts. At their source,movements in these areas may not be large enough to form a serious embarrass-ment to military movement, but if they are not controlled they may grow byaffecting the morale of other areas, and ultimately create a serious military and civil problem.The steps taken to deal with the problem where any plans have been madeare based on the selection in advance of refugee routes, which are mainlyunclassified routes and field paths, along which refugees will be directed on foot.Any cars which have escaped immobilisation (see Annex III, para. 44) will bedirected into car parks by the police or military traffic control personnel andthere immobilised.Contradiction of Rumours and Misleading Information.25. It may be expected that the enemy will attempt to disseminate rumoursand inaccurate orders and information, e.g., orders to evacuate certain towns,both to impede military operations and as part of his attack on civilian morale.It will be vital to contradict these and other rumours which will inevitably spreadwhen areas are cut off from contact with the rest of the country.A close watch is kept on all B.B.C. wavelengths throughout the 24 hours for enemy interference, which might take the form of- (a) straightforward jamming;(6) use of B.B.C. wavelengths, the broadcast being avowedly of enemy origin; and(c) simulated British broadcasts on B.B.C. wavelengths.No special measures are required under (a).If and when broadcasts of the (b) type are reported, the B.B.C. programme on the wavelength used by the enemy will be interrupted by a warning announce-ment, and this will be repeated at three-minute intervals until the enemy goesoff the air. This intervention will be made not only on the affected wavelength,but on all wavelengths carrying the same programme; for example, if the enemyshould make use of a Home Service wavelength, the announcement will be
broadcast on the three medium and the one short wavelength which carry theHome Service. If the arrangement with Fighter Command, whereby B.B.C.transmitters go off the air when their continued operation would assist direction-finding by enemy aircraft, is operating, it has been agreed that such transmitterscan come on the air to make the announcement at irregular intervals of not morethan three minutes without consulting Fighter Command, when the enemy isheard broadcasting on any wavelength which normally carries their programme.The detection of enemy interference of the (c) type is primarily the responsi-bility of a special reception station, though each transmitting station is instructedto keep a close watch on its own particular wavelengths. Once interference isdetected, counter-action takes the same form as with (b) type enemy action,except that the announcement made differs slightly in form.In general, the intervening announcer, on interrupting the programme, willpreface his statement by saying he is speaking from the B.B.C., by suggesting that his voice is probably recognised and by giving his name; he will thenannounce that the enemy is attempting to use the wavelength, and indicate that better reception of the B.B.C. programme could be obtained on some other wave-lengths. If, because of the Fighter Command arrangements, the services areinterrupted, the announcement will simply say that the enemy is using the wave-length, and that the B.B.C. programme will be heard elsewhere.If the B.B.C. transmitters are operating while the enemy tries to interfere,it is expected that in the areas where the enemy transmission is strongest the effect will be an unintelligible muddle, with neither programme easily audible; for thisreason, special jamming arrangements are not considered necessary. In other areas, it is expected that the B.B.C. transmission will predominate.26. The contradiction of rumours is the responsibility of the Ministry ofInformation. In normal conditions their Regional Information Officers areaccustomed to counter rumour by obtaining the correct information from official sources and circulating it to the public either through the local press or throughmembers of local Information Committees in each District. They would act inthe same way in invasion, but with the difference that, if communications were seriously delayed or severed, some time might elapse before information for publication reached the Regional Information Officer. This Officer, however, isin close touch with Regional Headquarters and would receive news as it became available there.In addition to the means of circulating information described above, plans have been prepared for dealing with the situation which would arise in the eventof a breakdown in newspaper production. These will be dealt with under thehead &quot; Maintenance of Civil Life &quot; (Annex V).It may be added that each Regional Information Officer has at his disposala number of motor-vehicles equipped with loud-speaker equipment, which can beused to supplement other means of disseminating information. Suitable instruc-tions have been issued regarding the immobilisation of these vans and their equipment if they are in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy.In exceptional circumstances the Regional Commissioner may arrange forthe broadcast of notices through the transmitters of the B.B.C.In order to forestall any attempt by the enemy to mislead or alarm the civilpopulation by issuing notices containing false instructions or information, amodel direction under D.R. 16A has been circulated to Regional Commissionersproviding that official notices giving advice, information or directions to the civilian population should be displayed only upon official notice-boards.Irish Refugees.27. Special arrangements have been made with the military authorities, thePolice and the Security Services to deal with an influx of refugees from ireland in the event of invasion of that country. British and Foreign ships in Irish portswill be instructed to return to specified ports in this country. Refugees arrivingon such ships will be examined and guarded pending examination by the Militaryauthorities in accommodation arranged through the local authority. Irishrefugees landing elsewhere on the coast will be collected and detained by theMilitary, with the co-operation of the police, for examination at the specifiedports. Immigration Officers have power under Article 1 of the Passenger Traffic(No. 5) Order, 1940, to refuse leave to land to any person arriving in this country[22879] &apos; D
from Ireland, and Immigration Officers at specified ports will be supplied witha list of suspects and will be instructed to refuse leave to land to any refugeewhose name appears on this list, or whom the Immigration Officer, the SecurityControl Officer or the Special Branch Officer regards as suspect.(iv) Administration of Justice.War Zone Courts.28. Attempts at sabotage and Eifth Column activity by civilians on invasionwill have to be provided for. To enable crimes of this kind and others, such aslooting, to be dealt with expeditiously the Minister of Home Security has, underthe authority of the Defence (War Zone Courts) Regulations, 1940, set up WarZone Courts for districts covering the whole of England and Wales. TheSecretary of State for Scotland has similarly set up War Zone Courts forScotland under the authority of the Defence (War Zone Courts) (Scotland)Regulations, 1940.War Zone Courts consist of a President and two Advisory members appointed by the President from Panels set up by the Home Secretary as regardsEngland, and by the Secretary of State for Scotland as regards Scotland. TwoPresidents have been appointed to each Region, in England and Wales, exceptLondon.  Six Presidents have been appointed for Scotland.A War Zone Court cannot function in an area unless that area has been declared by the Minister of Home Security under Regulation 5 to be a War Zone,and before the Minister can make such a declaration, he must be satisfied that, byreason of recent or immediately apprehended enemy action, the military situationin any area is such that criminal justice cannot be administered by the ordinarycourts with sufficient expedition. After consultation with the Secretary of Statefor War, the Minister has decided that preparations should be made on the basis that, at the outset of an invasion, he will declare War Zones covering the wholeof Great Britain (with the possible exception of London for the time being), thusbringing the War Zone Courts into operation over the country, outside the london district at any rate.The Presidents of the Courts may be in various parts of the country whenthe time comes for putting the War Zone Courts into operation, and arrangements have been made for passing certain messages to them (and others concerned) andfor conveying the Presidents at the proper time from the place where they mayhappen to be to the District of the Court to which they have been appointed. InEngland and Wales these messages will be issued through Regional headquarters and the Police, except as regards London, where special arrangements will bemade.  In Scotland the messages will be issued by the Scottish Home Department.Detention of Suspects.29. Lists of suspects (including aliens) to be detained if circumstances sorequire, have been prepared in the various Regions in consultation with thePolice. When an order is made by the Home Secretary applying Defence Regula-tion 18B (IB) to a particular area, the Regional Commissioner concerned will beinformed, and will give instructions to the Police to detain the listed suspects.

Schemes for the denial of resources to the enemy and for theimmobilisation of plant and equipment in danger of falling into his hands havebeen framed on the basis that any attempt at invasion will be defeated within ashort period. The object of the scheme is therefore to deny to the enemy allresources which he is capable of using to his immediate advantage, and the safeguarding of such essential plant as it is possible to conceal or remove inorder to prevent its destruction. As far as practicable, the methods of temporarydisruption and disablement will be employed, and only where it is unavoidablewill demolition be resorted to. The removal of valuable materials or plant must,in view of the limitations on road traffic and transport, be restricted to aminimum.(ii) Strategic Location and Distribution of Plant and Stocks.31. In general, stocks and commodities most likely to be of value to theenemy have been reduced in the vulnerable coastalIn particular, stocks of explosives at factories, magazines, and stores near the coast are maintained at the lowest possible level. Since removal of these stocks under emergency conditions might be a difficult operation, provision hasbeen made for the removal or drowning of fuses, incendiary compositions,detonators and other initiators. As a last resort, it will be, left to the military commander to order their destruction. Certain stocks of Admiralty explosives(notably mines) are stored in railway trucks in sidings. If they are in imminent danger of capture, the tracks leading to and from the sidings will be obstructed.These arrangements will not involve damage to main running lines. Petrol stockshave been drastically thinned and the Ministry of Food have made the necessaryplans for reducing to a minimum the food available for an invader, at the sametime holding sufficient retail and bulk stocks to provide for the civil population in fortress towns and elsewhere, or for a movement of refugees. (see annex V, pars. 78-80.)[22879] d,2
The removal of industry presents much greater difficulty. Fortunately thereare relatively few vital industrial establishments in the coastal areas most likelyto be attacked. The Ministry of Aircraft Production have removed practicallyalh their vital factories in this area to inland locations. Firms or factories of vital concern to Ministry of Supply factories were removed from 19 of the 31towns scheduled for compulsory evacuation, and review is now taking place toascertain whether there are such firms or factories in the 12 towns brought under the scheme at a later stage. The staff of any Ministry of Supply contractors&apos;factories remaining in the 31 towns will, if need arises, move out with the restof the civil population, but the loss of production will not be serious.(iii) Summary of Plans.Note: In each case the question of the authority responsible for initiating andimplementing the plans has been determined by the civil departments and service authorities concerned.Evacuation of Specialist Personnel.32. Important specialist personnel in Royal Ordnance Factories and otherMinistry of Supply establishments situated in coastal areas (mainly on the southand Welsh coasts) whose capture by the enemy would be serious will be evacuatedto other stations on invasion. The Ministry of Aircraft Production are makingcomparable arrangements for the evacuation of specialist personnel at ResearchStations and at a limited number of vital factories in the coastal belt. TheAdmiralty have no establishments to which the scheme need be applied.Immobilisation of Ports.33. Schemes have been drawn up to immobilise ports for a period of  to 10 days. They are designed to deny the enemy port facilities forunloading armoured fighting vehicles, guns and motor transport. Immobilisationwill wherever possible be effected by dismantling, or removing essential parts and demolition of port facilities will be reduced to a minimum.Railway Locomotives and Rolling Stock.34. Locomotives and rolling stock in coastal districts have already beenreduced to the minimum compatible with civil and military requirements. Rollingstocks would be of little value to the enemy in the absence of engines and measuresto deny him railway facilities have therefore been confined to the removal orimmobilisation of the latter.On &quot; Stand to &quot; a scheme for the nightly withdrawal of locomotives fromcoastal sheds will be put into force and a minimum number will be retained inthreatened areas for essential traffic. When lines can no longer be kept open oron specified orders from Command, all locomotives remaining in the affectedarea which cannot be withdrawn will be immobilised and abandoned.Vessels on Inland Waters.35. Under an order made by the Ministry of Home Security, craft in inlandwaters are required to have an essential part&quot;removed if left unattended. this requirement is enforced by the police, Home Guards, and officers of inlandnavigation authorities.Food.36. As stated in (ii) above, food stocks have been reduced to a minimum inthe vulnerable coastal areas. Home Forces policy is opposed to the destructionof food, but it is recognised that circumstances might arise in which this mayhave to be done, notwithstanding its effect on the civil population. In such casesthe responsibility for ordering destruction will rest with the local military commander. This rule applies to all foodstuffs, whether local stocks or bulkreserves, wherever situated. It is improbable that bulk stocks can be evacuated from inland areas which may form the enemy&apos;s objectives, as such movementswould add to traffic congestion and might well be disturbing to public morale.
Factories and Public Utility Undertakings.37. It is unlikely that the enemy could or would attempt to make use ofindustrial undertakings during the short time he might succeed in retaining a footing in the United Kingdom. Instructions have been issued to importantmunitions undertakings by the Departments concerned, indicating that manage-ments should have plans preparing effectively against the contingency of temporary seizure, and that the plans should provide for (a) the temporaryremoval, in so far as transport needs will allow, of important plant, papers, jigsand tools, which could only be replaced with great difficulty on the enemy&apos;s with-drawal, to prevent their destruction, and (6) the removal or, if that is not possible,the destruction of any stocks of materials or finished work which the enemy mightuse.  Similar advice is being issued to industry generally by the Board of Trade.The order to implement plans for the immobilisation of industrial plant will normally be given to the factory management by a responsible military officer.If, however, capture appears imminent and no order has been received, theresponsibility for implementing the plan will fall upon the senior official of themanagement.Public utility plants will not be immobilised. This policy is based on theview that no steps should be taken which would seriously affect civilian life andstimulate refugee movements unless the result would be to deny a service to theenemy which would be of material advantage to him.Livestock.38. The wholesale evacuation of livestock from coastal areas is not practic-able. The slaughter of livestock to prevent it falling into the hands of the enemy would only be undertaken if it would be of no use to the civilian population asfood, e.g., in an area which had been completely evacuated.Currency.39. Arrangements have been made for the transfer of currency from coastalregions in the event of compulsory evacuation. If evacuation proves unnecessary,Regional Commissioners will have to consider, in the light of military estimates of the risk, whether Banks should be told to put into force pre-arranged schemesfor the evacuation of such reserves, of currency as remain. In addition, instruc-tions have been issued for the destruction, if necessary, of bank notes and theremoval of coin, but this would only take place if seizure by the enemy was imminent and evacuation impossible.Railway and Road Bridges.40. As a matter of general policy, road and rail blocks will be used wherever possible as an alternative to the demolition of bridges. In some cases this is impracticable, and a few bridges on main railway lines have been prepared fordemolition in order to prevent the enemy&apos;s tanks from crossing tank obstacles.Precautions have been taken to guard against premature demolition and to ensurethat the Railway Company is informed locally before any action is taken.It may also be necessary to destroy certain road bridges, and a number invulnerable areas have been prepared for demolition, but charges have not been inserted.Colliery Machinery.41. Since it would be impracticable to remove any heavy machinery, theschemes for immobilising colliery machinery cover only the removal of smallworking parts, both to prevent the operation of the winding gear and othermachinery, and to save those parts from destruction which, if destined, would hold up the working of the pits for some time afterwards.Wireless Stations and Tele-Communications.42. Measures have been agreed between the Post Office and the B.B.C. andthe Defence Departments for denying telephone, wireless and telegraph communi-cations to the enemy.   These measures will be carried out by the Post Office and
B.B.C. engineers in collaboration with the Military Commanders concerned.Normally, in view of the importance of maintaining communications until thelast possible moment, no immobilisation will be undertaken except on the orders of the Military Commander; but it has been recognised by all concerned that inthe event of surprise attack (eg., by a gang of parachutists) the staff of the stations concerned might have to act &quot;on their own initiative and the instructionsprovide for this contingency.Petroleum Products.43. General Policy-The object of the approved arrangements is to denythe use of certain petroleum products to the enemy in the event of a successfullanding, while at the same time maintaining adequate stocks for Naval, Military,Air Force and essential Civilian needs. Stocks will not be destroyed or plant atstorage installations disrupted unless it is clear that they are about to fall intoenemy hands and their early recovery appears unlikely. The products concerned are petrol, kerosene, diesel oil (including derv fuel for use in vehicles and gas oil)and benzol. Instructions are about to be issued as to the treatment of stocks ofsuch liquids as toluene, acetone and ethyl alcohol, which can be used to runinternal combustion engines. Fuel oils and lubricating oils will not be destroyed.On invasion, Officers representing the Oil Control Board will be attached toG.H.Q. Home Forces, and Commands for the purpose of maintaining a properliaison in connexion with destruction proposals.Definitions: Pink Area.   The country has been divided into two areas :  (1) A coastal area known as the &quot; Pink &quot; Area, varying in width from 20-50miles, running, with certain gaps, roughly from Elgin, in E. Scotland,round the East and South Coasts to the Bristol Channel. NorthernIreland is also regarded as part of the Pink Area for certain purposes.(2) The remainder of the country.Disruption. Damage to, or removal of, vital parts of plant at oil installa-tions and refineries in order to deny easy access to the oil.Destruction. Destruction of oil stocks by fire or, in the case of undergroundstocks, by the use of explosives; this may result in destruction of the installation.Following is a summary of the arrangements made :  Important Civil Bulk Installations and Air Force Reserve Depots.Disruption. Ordered by an officer delegated by General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Command, and carried out by installation staff.Destruction. The authority for ordering destruction inside the Pink area is vested in officers specially selected by General Headquarters, Home Forces, and approved by the Oil Control Board. There are General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Commands, and Corps or Divisional Commanders.Authority for destruction of important Civil Installations outside the PinkArea is vested in General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Commands, or their personal representatives, with the exception of installations in the Clyde, Merseyand Bristol Channel Areas and Air Force Reserve Depots, wdiere the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, retains responsibility.Destruction of overground stocks will becarried out by the Installation Staffs,and of underground storage by the Military.Naval Installations.Destruction. Instructions given by General Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Command, or Corps Commander, who&quot; will transmit instructions to speciallyappointed local Naval Authority; work to be carried out by Admiralty staff.Air Force Distributing Depots.Disruption.

As for Bulk Installations.Tankers Berthed at Installations.The Senior Naval Officer or Flag Officer in Command has made arrangements to remove tankers if time is available, or, failing this, to render them unusableby the enemy for a period of seven to ten days. Only as a last resort woulddestruction take place. The authority for ordering the carrying out of these measures is the same as that for destruction at the installation.Benzol.Stocks of Benzol will be contaminated with coal tar on the order of the local military Commander nominated by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Command.Petrol and Diesel Stocks at Garages and Commercial Consumers&apos; Premises.Inside the Pink Area. The number of operative garage sites in the area has been drastically cut down, resulting in a reduction of sites of from 80 to 85 percent, in E. and S.E. England, and 50 per cent, in S.W. England, in Scotland andin Northern Ireland.The underground tanks at garages and commercial consumers&apos; premises willbe sealed by blocking the fill and suction pipes, which will make the extraction of oil virtually impracticable.The sealing of tanks will be ordered by the Local Military Commander and carried out under the supervision of the Home Guard, or, where the military authority so arrange, by the Police.The necessary preparatory work for sealing has been carried out.In addition to the provision made for sealing described above, nightlyimmobilisation by removal of vital parts of the pump is obligatory at all sitesunattended at night.Under the present scheme, stocks of diesel oil (including gas oil and &quot; derv.&quot;)in overground tanks at industrial premises (e.g., gas works) will be destroyed on the order of the local Military Commander.Many water pumping plants situated in the vulnerable &quot; pink area &quot; carrylarge stocks of diesel oil. Considerable difficulty has been experienced inco-ordinating the essential military need to deny the oil to the enemy with therequirements of the civil population, bearing in mind that, if water supplies fail,a refugee movement will almost certainly develop. It is hoped, however, that a compromise will be reached under which, in general, stocks of diesel oil will belimited to 14 days&apos; supplies, or, exceptionally, 21 days. In the event of invasiondestruction of stocks would be delayed to the last possible moment, methods being i worked out in advance to meet the circumstances of each undertaking.
Outside the Pink A rea. Nightly immobilisation by the removal of vital partsof the pumps is obligatory at all sites unattended at night, These parts are placedin a sack and., in the event of invasion, the sack will be collected by the home guard and hidden away from the site.Farmers&apos; Stacks of Kerosene glamourising oil for tractors. &amp;c). ^Stocks inthe Pink Area are limited to 500 gallons except by agreement with the militaryauthorities. No arrangements have been made for immobilisation of stocks of under 500 gallons as these are usually at very isolated and inaccessible sites.Where larger stocks exist in underground storage the tanks will be sealed as described in paragraph 2.Military and Air Force Stocks of Tinned Fuel.Every effort will be made to evacuate stocks if threatened. As a last resortthey will be destroyed by fire.Rail Tank Cars and, Road Tank Wagons.On receipt of &quot; Stand To &quot; orders the railways will keep a check on themovement of all rail tank cars of petrol and fuel oils in and proceeding to an area affected by the order. The military authorities will be advised of these movements. At the same time the Board will arrange to reduce the number of rail cars sent from installations outside the threatened area and hasten thedischarge of rail tank cars already at installations and depots within the area.Isolated cars will, wherever practicable, be off-loaded by the Petroleum Board intoroad tank wagons and removed from the threatened area, or will be run to wastein the last resort, A number of road tank wagons will be retained in the threatened area so long as practicable to meet essential needs for civil defence.Details of time schedules of train workings are now being prepared with the objectof reducing; considerably the number of loaded rail tank cars in the Pink Area atany time.Motor Vehicles.44. Existing requirements. The immobilisation of all unlicensed privatemotor vehicles has already been carried out in a coastal belt along the sea boundary of No. 4 Region. Essential vehicles in this belt have been provided with a modifiedform of EL label (see Annex IV), and the entry of unlabelled vehicles into thearea is prohibited. In addition, all unlicensed private vehicles in the South-Eastern Region have been immobilised.Invasion Measures. It is not possible to carry out any general scheme ofremoval or immobilisation of vehicles in populous vulnerable areas prior toinvasion, since to do so would be to bring the normal life of the community to a standstill. When the time comes for ordering the imposition of restrictions onvehicles it will be too late to order their removal, and reliance must be placedsolely on immobilisation.The plans for achieving this immobilisation are briefly as follows :  At some time, which may be shortly before or after the issue of ActionStations, the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, will empower such Commandsas he thinks fit to ask the Regional Commissioner to order the immobilisation ofnon-essential vehicles (i.e., those not provided with EL labels) within certainpre-determined areas in his Region. The area within which immobilisation maybe carried out at this stage comprises a coastal strip from Dingwell to the Wash,the counties of Cambridgeshire (except the Isle of Ely), Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex,Nos. 6 and 12 Regions and a coastal strip in No. 7 Region. The inclusion ofNo. 5 Region is under consideration.To cover the possibility of a breakdown of communications, regional commissioners will delegate their power as regards immobilisation to chief constables, with the proviso that they shall only be exercised on the request of theappropriate military commander.In the case of unlicensed vehicles the governing signal is the warning thatEL labels may shortly be brought into force. On or after they have received thiswarning Regional Commissioners may at their discretion order the immobilisationof all unlicensed vehicles in all or any part of their Region; in this case,immobilisation is not restricted to the pre-determined areas.
If, at any time after invasion has taken place, an area has become the scene of operations, the Military commander is entitled to order the immobilisation of anyvehicles which appear to be in danger of falling into the hands of any enemy.Immobilisation will be carried out by the owner or user of the vehicle and enforced by the police. Methods of immobilisation which will do the minimum of permanent harm to the vehicle have been devised and publicised among vehicleowners.Tractors.45. In view of the importance of maintaining food production, farmtractors will not be put out of action until they are in imminent danger of captureby the enemy, and then only in a five-mile coastal belt.Pedal Cycles.46. There will be no immobilisation of pedal cycles except at the stage whenthey are in danger of falling into enemy hands. The appropriate time for, andthe most suitable method of, immobilisation will be the subject of generalpublicity as an invasion preliminary. The responsibility for immobilisation is onthe owner.Constructional Plant.47. The Ministry of Works and Buildings have issued instructions to all their officers who may be in charge of such plant as excavating machinery whichmight be of immediate assistance to the enemy, providing for the immobilisationby the removal of vital parts (e.g., magnetos). All parts will be labelled in orderthat the machines may be put back into commission with the least possible delay.Destruction of Official Documents in Danger of Falling into the Handsof the Enemy.48. The Treasury have issued a general instruction on this subject to all government Departments. It emphasises that in modern war, where penetrationmay be deep and rapid in some areas and air landings may occur, all buildings are vulnerable to at least temporary capture, and therefore that precautions mustbe equally complete throughout the country. No precise rules of general applica-tion are laid down, and the appropriate time for destruction is left to the discretion of the local officer of the department concerned. It is, however,suggested that a distinction might be drawn between papers of immediate use toan attacking unit (e.g., those indicating the location of stores, factories and vitalpoints) and papers conveying information of more general use (e.g., those bearing on the production capacity of the country or the production programme);. if thisis possible, the former are to be destroyed first. A further suggestion is that,since fire is the only satisfactory means of destruction, arrangements should bemade, where possible, for destruction under appropriate safeguards at a near-bypower station or other suitable place.ITT---Tl^^    . T?w/.tt i ivnnn49. These systems would be of value to the enemy as a means of dissemi-nating false information and instructions. In the event of invasion the staffs ofthe exchanges will keep in touch with the policy, and plans have been preparedfor immobilising the equipment should the Regional Commissioner decide thatit is necessary in the light of the military situation.[22879]F.

One of the most important factors in the maintenance of production ininvasion is the co-ordination of the transport requirements of the Services, and theneed for denying vehicles to the enemy, with the needs of factories both in regardto the movement of goods and the transport of workers to and from their employment.Rail Traffic.51. Should invasion take place, it is obvious that heavy responsibilities mustfall on the Railways. Apart from the speedy handling of urgent Service traffic,they will be responsible in a large measure for the distribution of necessities to the civilian population and for the maintenance of war production in areas not directly affected.The direction, extent and nature of the attack can only be forecast on broadlines, and, while certain areas may be looked on as more likely objects of attack,it is impossible to confine consideration to these points. The whole of the areasouth of a line from the Wash to the Bristol Channel must be consideredvulnerable and included in any scheme for traffic control. It is equally impossibleto forecast the period of preliminary warning that may be received.Wrhile it is impossible to be more precise on these points, it can be forecastwith certainty that the enemy is equally aware of the vital importance of therailways and will do his utmost to dislocate communications.Under these conditions the need for some pre-arranged method of control of rail traffic is apparent. Such a scheme, to be effective, must be simple in outline,rapid in execution and thoroughly understood by those responsible for putting it into effect and those who will be requiring rail facilities during invasion.
Further, it must reduce traffic to a level at which it can be handled currentlyand leave a sufficient margin of capacity for dealing with urgent service requirements.The schemes set out below, which have been agreed by the Central transport committee, have been drawn up to meet the exceptional conditions that have beenoutlined.Freight Traffic (including passenger rated traffic).52. The whole of the country south of a line from the Wash to the bristol channel covering the Eastern, South-Eastern and Southern Commands has been divided up into zones selected from a railway operating point of view in such away that restrictions on the forwarding of freight traffic to each zone can beapplied independently.There will be two categories of restriction between normality and completerestriction : (i) Restriction X, probably inaugurated in certain threatened zones on&quot; action stations &quot; or, after invasion, in zones adjacent to a zone inwhich restriction Y is in force, at which a reduction of traffic by approximately 40 per cent, should be secured,(ii) Restriction Y, probably inaugurated in zones immediately threatenedor in part occupied by the enemy after invasion has occurred, at whicha reduction of traffic by some 75 to 80 per cent, should be aimed at.This might be followed by- (iii) A restriction Z, i.e., complete cessation of all traffic probably owing tothe substantial occupation of this zone by the enemy.Under Restriction X all movement of freight traffic (including passengerrated traffic) to or within or out of the zone to which the restriction applies, willbe confined to the following :  (i) Consignments to or from Naval, Military, Air Force or Ministry ofSupply establishments (eg., dockyards, ordnance factories, munition works, &amp;c), to His Majesty&apos;s ships or to or from Military or Air force units or other detachments or other locations which indicate that thegoods are being sent for His Majesty&apos;s Forces.Consignments passing otherwise than in full truck loads from.A.F. contractors&apos; works to aircraft establishments and between theworks of joint contractors engaged in connection with production of aircraft.(ii) Arms, ammunition, military instruments and components therefor, sodescribed in the consignment note.A.R.P. stores and equipment.Cigarettes, tobacco and matches.Coal to power stations, gas works, sewage works and waterworks,munition works (including coke ovens, blast furnaces,  iron andsteel works, sulphuric acid plants and zinc and other non-ferrousmetal works) and for bunkering.Feeding stuffs for live-stock and poultry.Food-stuffs for human consumption the following : Canned meat and canned milk.Grain and flour.Sugar.Potatoes.Perishable food-stuffs.Hydrocarbon oils (petrol, fuel oils and engine lubricating oils).Medical stores and equipment.Telegraph and telephone stores.Agricultural and vegetable seeds (including seed potatoes) from mid-September to mid-May.Spare parts and units for motor vehicles (new, reconditioned or forreconditioning).(iii) Any consignment to the consignment note of which is affixed an EssentialTraffic Certificate issued by a movement officer of a GovernmentDepartment authorised to issue such certificates.(At present the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, Ministry ofFood and Ministry of Supply&apos;are so authorised.)[22879] E 2
With reference to (iii) Movement Officers will be instructed that essentialtraffic certificates should only be issued on the request of competent officers at the receiving end for goods vitally necessary and urgently required.Under Restriction Y all movements of freight traffic (including passengerrated traffic) to or within or out of the zone to which the restriction applies willbe restricted except the following: (i) Traffic ordered forward by the Movement Officers of the service departments.(ii) Any consignments of the following : A.R.P. Stores and equipment.Medical Stores and equipment.Telegraph and telephone stores.Selected perishable food-stuffs, e.g., milk, bread, yeast, bacon,butter, fish and butchers&apos; meat.(iii) Any consignment to the consignment note of which there is affixed anEssential Traffic Certificate issued by a Movement Officer of aGovernment Department authorised to issue such certificates. (Theissue of these Essential Traffic Certificates will be governed by similarsafeguards as under Restriction X.)(At present the Admiralty. War Office, Air Ministry, Ministry ofFood and Ministry of Supply are so authorised.)Passenger Services.53. The Railway Executive Committee have reached the conclusion that theproposed restriction of passenger services could not be applied by zones such asthose proposed for the purpose of restricting forwarding of freight traffic.Restrictions on passenger services therefore will be applied by railway operatingareas. Thus, in the case of the Southern Railway, restricted services would beapplied to the Eastern, Central, or Western operating sections (the old South-Eastern and Chatham, London, Brighton and South Coast, and London andSouth-Western railway respectively). In East Anglia and Essex the restrictionwould apply to the Old Great Eastern and Tilbury and Southend Lines and totihe Midland and Great Northern Joint Line. Further consideration is being given to the other lines within the affected areas. The passenger service restric-tions are as follows : (a) Restriction PX, probably inaugurated on &quot;Action Stations&quot; when anoperating area or any part of an operating area is threatened. the sunday time-table will be put into force throughout that operatingarea, but with the addition of Suburban and full workmen&apos;s servicesand such other services on main or branch lines as the railway executive Committee deem it necessary to run.(b) Restriction PY, probably inaugurated after invasion when an operatingarea is in part occupied by the enemy. The Sunday time-table will be cancelled in that operating area, but workmen&apos;s and local services willrun as required and as conditions allow, with such additional trainsas might be imperative outside the sphere of operations.(c) Restriction PZ, i.e., complete cessation of passenger services in anoperating area probably owing to the substantial occupation of thearea by the enemy.Operation of Restrictions.54. Instructions to impose these restrictions will be given to the railway executive Committee by the Ministry of War Transport normally on the advice and recommendation of Movement Control. The Ministry of War Transport will immediately advise all Departments concerned when the restrictions are imposed.The Railway Executive Committee is arranging for all stations throughoutthe country to be supplied wdth a booklet containing an alphabetical list of the stations in the country south of the line from the Wash to the Bristol Channel,showing in which restriction area each station is situated. The booklet will alsocontain definitions of restrictions X, Y and Z.
On instructions being received from the Ministry of War Transport, e.g.,that restriction X is to be applied to areas A and B, and restriction Y to area C,all stations will be notified forthwith and no traffic will be accepted for anydestination in those areas except that permitted under the relevant restriction.Traffic other than the permitted traffic which is en route for the restrictedareas will be stabled at convenient places, and, after consultation with theMovement Officers of the Departments concerned, diverted as soon as may be toother destinations at which it can be accepted. Failing that, it may have to bedumped.The question of the adequacy of powers and machinery for stopping and either diverting or dumping traffic en route to areas to which Restrictions X, Yor Z may be applied and which is restricted from conveyance to such areas isbeing further explored.When restriction PX, PY or PZ is applied to any operating area arrange-ments will be made for all passenger stations to be advised and passengers forany destination in that operating area to be warned.Road Traffic.55. Arrangements for the control of road transport have been made on thebasis that civilian road transport should carry on as long as possible, subject tothe need for denying transport to the enemy and keeping roads clear for militarymovements. The latter point only is dealt with here; the former is covered underthe heading &quot; Denial of Resources to the Enemy.&quot;   (Annex III.)Control of civil road transport will be effected by the imposition on, or incertain special circumstances before, &quot;Action Stations,&quot; of a system ofemergency labels known as the E.L. Label System. This system was introduced to distinguish civil vehicles essential to the life of the community or to war production, and approximately 25 per cent, of the vehicles now licensed, whichwill be required for civil purposes (other than passive defence purposes) ininvasion conditions, have been provided with such labels.The label does not in itself confer on the vehicle carrying it a prescriptiveright to proceed, and when military operations are in progress, or important military movements are taking place, roads needed by the military will be closedas may be necessary to all vehicles other than military ones. It is expected thatthis stage will last only for a comparatively short period, except in areas inwhich fighting is actually taking place.As the E.L. label system is a national one, and involves many types ofvehicle, it has been considered impracticable to subdivide traffic bearing E.L.labels into classes of varying importance. No local system of labels purporting to give priority to any particular type of traffic will therefore be permitted. If,however, at some stage it should be necessary for the police or military authori-ties to restrict the movement of vehicles bearing EL. labels, the free circulation of essential civil vehicles with an operational role will continue under arrange-ments by which certain categories of vehicles will be allowed through. In somecases these vehicles will have to bear signs to show that they belong to one or other of these categories. The necessity for such a sign arises from the expansion ofthe civil defence and other services, which has necessitated the use of adaptedprivate cars to supplement the existing resources; such vehicles are equallyessential with those the function of which is clearly indicated by their appear-ance, and it is therefore necessary to give them some marking to ensure that they receive the same treatment. The vehicles to which this arrangement applies arethe civil defence vehicles and ambulances, fire engines and appliances, policecars, post office repair vans, and possibly selected food vehicles and petroleumlorries.In present circumstances many vehicles on official and other business carrylabels to facilitate their movement. To avoid the confusion which might arise if these labels were displayed side by side with EL. labels it has been decidedthat on &apos;&apos; Action Stations &apos;&apos; the Minister of War Transport will make an order prohibiting the display of labels other than the E.L. label, the ministerialpriority sign, and certain labels carried on Admiralty, G.P.O. and police vehicles.In the special circumstances of S.E. Command a further refinement of thesystem of traffic control will be adopted. Briefly, the arrangement is that, at the stage when the free circulation of E.L. label traffic within any area is no longer
possible, the area will be declared an emergency traffic zone; following this declaration the only vehicles allowed to proceed will be those which are givenmovement orders at traffic control posts round the perimeter of, and at roadjunctions wuthin, the zone.Road Information Intelligence System.56. Arrangements are also being made for-the institution under invasionconditions of a nation-wide intelligence system for the guidance of road traffic.&apos; The intention of this system is that traffic for a destination in an area to whichaccess is barred may be warned at source or en route and so prevent the approaches to the affected area being congested by traffic unable to proceed andcompelled to turn in its tracks. For the operation of this scheme regional commissioners will be supplied from Home Security War Room with all avail-able information about the general road position; from Regional Headquartersthis will be passed to the Regional Transport Commissioners, the Regionalrepresentatives of the Supply Departments and other interested Departments,and to Chief Constables for circulation to all the larger police stations. Duringinvasion, conditions will presumably be changing rapidly, and for this reason the information supplied to Regions in this way cannot be accurate or detailed;it will, however, give a rough guide to vehicles which are setting out on long distance journeys. Thus, by enquiry at police stations or at the Offices of theDistrict Transport Offices of the Ministry of War Transport, drivers will beable to obtain general information as to the road situation throughout the country.Information regarding road conditions within regions will similarly be madeavailable to police stations and District Transport Offices in the Region fromRegional Headquarters.Shipping.Ships in Port.57. Instructions have been issued to shipowners and masters as to themanner in which ships in port should be kept ready for departure with as little delay as possible, e.g., ships should, whenever possible, be bunkered on arrival at a United Kingdom port; stores and provisions to be taken on as soon as possible after berthing; power to be available, &amp;c. The object is to ensure that withina minimum period all ships, not held up by repairs, can leave the port as ordered.Instructions have been issued to owners and masters as to what course ships should pursue if ordered to sea from a particular port by the Naval Authorities.Port authorities have been instructed to ensure that competent staff willbe available at all times to man lock gates, &amp;o, in case it is necessary for ships in port to make a &apos;&apos; crash &apos;&apos; exit.A few days before attack is suspected (i.e., on the second stage of readiness)independent coastal sailings will be suspended. Orders for suspension of coastal convoys and for clearing ports of ocean shipping will be given by the Admiralty,as and when judged to be necessary. Certain ships will be retained in harbourfor use in immobilisation schemes and for the general defence of the ports.Agents and masters have been instructed to maintain close touch with theirrespective Shipping Representatives, particularly if invasion appears imminent.In case of invasion, merchant shipping in United Kingdom ports will be controlled by Flag Officers in Charge acting on Admiralty instructions, whether conveyed tothem direct or through the Shipping Representative. The Flag Officer in Chargewill, in conjunction with the Shipping Representative, call on officers and crewsto stand by, prepare ships for sea, &amp;c.Ships at Sea.58. Diversion of ships at sea to and from particular areas will be under-taken by the Naval authorities in accordance with strategical and military considerations. Subject to such instructions the Ships Distribution (Diversion)Room, Ministry of War Transport, will direct ships, ordered from their normal course, to new destinations.Post Office Services.Telecommunications.59. Special measures have been taken to safeguard the public-communications systems on which the civil war effort, and, to a lesser extent.
the Defence Departments depend. In this connection it has been borne in mind that an invasion attempt might be preceded by heavy bombing; and Post Officeefforts have been concentrated on securing for the communication systems themaximum degree of immunity from damage. In London, where particularlyheavy bombing may be expected, a network of cables has been laid in the tuberailway system, and a deep level communications tunnel for cables has been drivenalong Whitehall to give a protected outlet from the Whitehall War Rooms tothe tube railway network. Certain other tunnels to provide deep level outletsfrom Faraday Building, the London Trunk Telephone Centre, to the tube railwaynetwork, are also under construction. Exchanges on the outskirts of Londonhave been equipped to give a partial trunk and toll service if Faraday Buildingwere destroyed, but in such circumstances the position will be rather an anxiousone pending the completion of a protected reserve exchange which is expected tobe available for service early in 1942. By the beginning of the winter 200manually-operated telephone exchanges will have been equipped with basementswitchboards from which essential services can be given, and in addition steps have been and are being taken to provide alternative means of service forimportant lines in many other towns. Plans have been made to intercept trunkand junction cables at the fringes of towns and in some 70 towns small emergencyexchanges are being installed at these interception points. Links are being provided between the interception points by ring cables to minimise the riskof interruption where the centre of a town is devastated.As regards telegraphs in London, four telegraph centres have been establishedaway from the Central area with independent circuits to provincial centres.These offices are working now. They are linked with one another by circuits incables in the tube railways or by routes avoiding the central areas as far as is practicable. The reserve Central Telegraph Office, which had been provided in adeep basement before the war, also has circuits to the Provinces in the tube railwaycables. A reserve office, equipped to carry all essential traffic, is also established in the suburbs.Similar schemes of decentralisation are in process of installation in theimportant provincial cities. Some 60 offices were equipped before the war togive a skeleton service from basement locations. This number has been increasedto 120 and the level of reserve service brought up to about 50 per cent. Many ofthem are already available and all will be available by the autumn.Restoration of Essential Services.60. Special attention has been paid to the restoration of telephone service toessential subscribers in blitzed towns where communications suffer; and in collaboration with the Ministry of Home Security arrangements have beencompleted whereby the Post Office will participate in &quot; pre-blitz &quot; committees in respect of towns which the Regional Commissioner designates as likely targets.Immediately following a blitz the Post Office will settle on the spot with the regional Commissioners&apos; representative the order in which wires are to be restored.Emergency Wireless Scheme.61. An emergency inland wireless service scheme has been set up, so that,in the event of complete isolation telegraphically and telephonically-of variousareas in the country, it will be practicable to send or receive urgent Governmenttelegrams to or from an office or offices still connected with the main network ofthe rest of the country.  Approximately 40 Areas are involved in this scheme.London Attack Signal (see Annex II (paragraph 1)).62. If the London signal is sounded at a time when the night staffs onlyare on duty, arrangements have been agreed with Scotland Yard whereby theL.P.T.B. will run special buses for the conveyance of essential telephone operatingstaffs and engineering staffs to their offices so that the operation and maintenanceof the communication services may adequately be provided for. It has also beenagreed that freedom of movement shall be given to Post Office engineering utilityvehicles engaged on repair of essential circuits; and a restricted movement of postal vehicles and telegraph delivery messengers has also been provided for. Allthe necessary arrangements have been made
ReCANALISATION   OF   SUPPLY   OF   RAW   MATERIAL   AND   DlSTRIRUTION  OF   FlNALProducts.63. It is clear that in conditions accompanying invasion the establishedsystem of supply assembly and distribution of war products will be subject tostrain arising both from the limitations of transport (which will be stringent inthe areas under attack and subject to more or less heavy bombing in other-areas), and from the circumstances that sources of supply, whether of raw materialor of subsidiary products, may be in areas of active operations. The Departmentsconcerned have satisfied us that detailed plans could not be made in advance tomeet these conditions.If contractors &quot; lose &quot; their sub-contractors or normal sources of supply arecut off or destroyed, reliance will have to be placed on the Regional Organisationof the Supply Departments, which includes Area Officers, Regional Representa-tives of the Raw Materials Departments of the Ministry of Supply and repre-sentatives of the main Controls. It would be the primary function of these officials to assist main contractors to obtain supplies from alternative firms as far aspracticable. No attempt could be made in advance to group main and sub-contractors on a regional basis. Any attempt at switching supplies must besubject to severe limitations since the production of materials is so tight and theproduction of many sizes and specifications of materials so specialised. It is,however, the general policy of the Supply Departments to arrange that firmsrequiring raw materials should draw them from the nearest source, of supply.It is, of course, not always possible to follow this rule too rigidly. There areoverriding factors, such as the distribution of the industry concerned and the availability of particular types of industrial capacity. In particular, theprovision which it is possible to make for the possible failure of supplies of steelis very strictly limited by the concentration of the industry in relatively fewplaces. There are also special difficulties arising out of the necessity for supplyingparticular firms with special grades and classes of raw materials, which have tobe drawn from comparatively distant sources. Again, as many raw materials arein very short supply, and it is frequently necessary to maintain production inparticular works, it is sometimes necessary to arrange hauls which would beuneconomical in normal times.Nevertheless, the Supply Departments have surveyed sources of raw materials and productive capacity, and, so far as the supply position permits, have arranged for the dispersal of available stocks as widely as possible throughout areas ofproduction; as a part of this policy stocks of materials have been laid down with individual firms in order to meet the situation which would arise if transport difficulties become very serious. For instance, in the case of the Ministry of aircraft Production, stocks of the two main raw materials, magnesium andaluminium, sufficient for four to six weeks&apos; production have been laid down in theworks of producers in all areas.So far as distribution is concerned, a plan has been worked out between theWar Office and the Ministry of Supply, under which certain listed items whichwould normally be sent to an ordnance depot will be diverted direct to Commandsif necessity arises. The practicability of this plan is not settled beyond doubtand the question is at present under fresh review by the War Office.Coal Stocks.64. The only practicable plan which can be made in advance is to distributestocks as widely and generously as possible. This in turn depends on output andtransport. Owing to shortage of output it is most important that distributionof supplies should continue to the last possible moment. In regard to transport,machinery has been devised for the diversion of any consignments of coal held up in course of transit by rail and unable to reach their destination within areasonable time owing to enemy action. This machinery can be used either forclearing particular lines of communication at short notice or relieving congestion &apos;in marshalling yards or sidings and is operated both locally and at headquarters.It has been used extensively since the autumn of 1940 both in London and in theprovinces.The stocking programme of the Mines Department provides for creatingrelatively heavier reserves in areas which are more remote from coal fields or
likely to be difficult of access because of traffic congestion. Subject to that con-sideration, the Departments aim is to see that all classes of consumers have asmuch coal in stock as the level of output and their relative priorities permit, andthat the stock is distributed as evenly as possible between the consumers in each class. Special attention is being given to the public utilities, and so far as thepublic utilities in the coastal areas are concerned it is considered that the gasworks should be able to lift from stock sufficient coal to keep them going during a period of, say, 4 weeks without receiving any supplies. Some of the eiectricityworks cannot lift out of stock quickly enough, but they should be able to reduce their consumption and, if necessary, get assistance from the grid.As regards public utilities in London, the larger companies, particularly the gas Light and Coke Company and the County of London Electricity SupplyCompany, cannot normally &quot; pick up &quot; from stock at a sufficient rate to meet their peak winter consumption, and depend partly on the flow of currentdeliveries. If, however, the danger period falls in early autumn and theemergency, when it arises, does not last more than four weeks, these companies should be able to carry on; as far as electricity is concerned, by readjustment ofthe grid programme; and as regards gas works, by a readjustment of rail-bornesupplies which would enable coal to be delivered by barge, ex tipping stations, toworks on the river. Should sea-borne supplies be stopped for more than four weeks or during the winter, the position would be serious. They will certainly be stopped during the crisis of the invasion.Detailed plans have been made for the transport by road of up to 50,000 tonsof coal a week across the Thames in the event of cross-river rail communicationsbeing interrupted by severe air attack. Under invasion conditions this scheme could not operate in its present form, but it could, if necessary, be adaptedaccording to the circumstances to assist in maintaining a supply of coal toessential consumers south of the Thames.Supply of Petroleum Products.65. The following is a summary of the arrangements which have beenmade:  A number of road tank wagons will operate in threatened areas so long aspracticable to maintain petrol supplies for civil defence and for other essentialpurposes.Certain rail heads have been earmarked on the western outskirts of london to receive complete train loads of rail tank cars in the event of the normal channels of distribution being interrupted. These rail tank cars will be unloaded directinto road tank wagons for immediate distribution to the retail trade and to con-sumers in the Metropolitan and other areas to maintain minimum requirements.Negotiations are nearly completed for the earmarking of a number of otherrail heads near to the boundary of the Pink Area (see Annex III, para. 43) to beused as required to supply the Pink Area or threatened area, after the resumptionof civil life, until such time as any disrupted tanks can be put into commissioner other tankage brought into operation.A number of portable tanks are held available in various parts of the countryto loan to the civil defence authorities if required for the transportation of water.A number of road tank wagons are also held at a central point to supplement theportable tanks, if required.A number of portable tanks have been issued to the fire-fighting services forthe movement of petrol to supplement their &quot; can &quot; supplies. Stocks of petrolare available at points selected by the local authority, but, to safeguard theposition, arrangements exist whereby each fire-fighting authority can apply atany time to the local District Operator of the Petroleum Board for additional requirements.In order to avoid unnecessary congestion of the railways, the PetroleumBoard have agreed to withhold up to 50,000 tons of rail traffic during the first fortnight of an invasion.   Details of the scheme are being worked out by theI Transport Priority Committee.Instructions have been issued to the Petroleum Departments Divisionalorganisation as to the action to be taken by the Divisional Petroleum Officers inthe event of a breakdown of communications between Headquarters and a CivilCommissioners Region.[228791      1 F
Maintenance of Power Supplies.66. Unless otherwise instructed, all electricity undertakings will maintainfull supplies to vital and other works as long as they are in a position to do so.The electrical industry is fully organised for speedy repairs and restorationof supplies of power in case of interruption by enemy action. In addition all important areas are linked with the National Grid System and can obtainemergency supplies from the Grid as necessary.Iron rations for factory canteens.67. The Ministry of Pood have undertaken to provide emergency reserves of iron rations for essential workers in factories of national importance in themost vulnerable areas. It will be necessary to exercise some discrimination inthe application of this principle in view of the effect which a wide distributionof emergency reserves would have upon national stocks.The Ministry of Aircraft Production have arranged with the Ministry ofFood for supplies of iron rations to be held by the more important firms in coventry, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Southampton; these are sufficient for atleast 48 hours, and could with care be made to cover 72 hours. Although these stocks were provided primarily to cope with such situations as result fromintensive air attacks, they will equally be available to cope with invasionconditions.Emergency Finance.68. The Regional banking arrangements agreed between the Treasury andthe banks deal comprehensively with the financial problems which may arise wfiencommunications between headquarters and the Regions are cut off. These arrange-ments are designed, inter alia, to provide for a supply of working capitalout of which current expenditure, including the payment of wages, may bemet. Regional Banking Advisers have been appointed to advise regional commissioners.Control of Plans made by Industry.69. We have given above a picture of the plans which have been made tomaintain war production, and have paid particular attention to the special-problems of factory managements, which in our view will be transport, staffingarrangements, the supply of raw materials and power, the distribution of finished products and immobilisation (see Annex III).It has been suggested that the various plans which have been prepared mightbe tested by special production &quot; exercises.&quot; We are in favour of such exercises,provided that tihey can be carried out without detriment to production, and weunderstand that some factory managements have already participated in local defence exercises. As an important preliminary, however, we think it most desirable that the Supply Departments should test, by means of inspections, the effectiveness of the advice given to managements on such matters as immobilisationof plant. These inspections might, in the first instance, be applied to a sector of the area likely to be threatened and the lessons learned communicated to allother factories. The opportunity might also be taken to ascertain how far the selected factories are prepared to meet the staffing problems which will confrontthem under heavy bombing.We have reason to think that a great deal of apprehension exists in the minds of employers as well as employees arising from ignorance of the preparations made as they affect industry generally. For example, it has been represented to us that when invasion comes much valuable plant may be destroyedby &quot; sledge-hammer&quot; methods because those responsible for it do not fullyunderstand what the policy of Government is in relation to immobilisation and what is required of them. In view of the importance of maintaining productionand of securing the full co-operation of employers and workers, the production executive might consider whether measures could not be taken regionally to informand reassure employers and workers on these points.In invasion a recognised link between the Regional Commissioner on the onehand and organisations of employers and workpeople on the other will serve a
useful purpose in keeping the Regional Commissioner in touch with labour andmanagements in his Region. We understand that by agreement with the Ministryof Home Security the Trades Union Congress have appointed representatives ineach Region who will be authorised to act on behalf of the T.U.C. if communi-cations break down. The British Employers&apos; Confederation, in consultation withthe Federation of British Industries, are considering similar appointments.Agriculture.70. In areas of active operations, farming operations will be impossible.Farmers have, however, been told that they should carry on to the last possible moment, and that steps should be taken to maintain essential work, e.g., themilking of cows. They have been advised to make produce, which they cannotdispose of in the ordinary way, available to the local population, and this shouldbe of some help in maintaining food supplies in isolated areas.(ii) Government and Analogous Services.Government Departments.Duties of Staff.71. All Government Departments will receive the messages &quot; Stand to &quot; and&quot; Action Stations.&quot;   (See Annex II, paragraph 1.)The Treasury have issued instructions as to the action to be taken on receiptof the invasion messages. On &quot; Stand to,&quot; each office will review the arrange-ments that they have made, and ensure that everything is in a complete state of readiness for their implementation. On &quot; Action Stations,&quot; essential staffs ofGovernment Departments will be in attendance night and day for this purpose,&quot;essential&quot; has been defined as &quot;essential to that part of the work of theDepartment which must continue even under invasion conditions.&quot; In accordancewith the policy of &apos;&apos; stand firm and carry on,&apos;&apos; staffs other than essential staffs willbe warned on &apos;&apos; Action Stations &apos;&apos; that, so long as they can continue to get towork, they should do so. In the special case of London, specific instructions havenot been issued as to the movement of non-essential staffs after the sounding ofthe London Invasion Signal, but the Treasury Instructions provide for the intro-duction at a suitable stage of the Reporting Centre machinery which was instituted under the original evacuation schemes. Thus, if and when circum-stances justify the step, non-essential staffs will be told that they will not beexpected to make their way to work, and they will receive all subsequent instruc-tions from their Reporting Centres. As regards the feeding of essential staffs,the War Office has agreed to supply Departments with essential rations on an agreed scale. The General Post Office are making special arrangements with theMinistry of Food for the supply of iron rations for their essential staffs in themain centres of communication, where under invasion conditions it will not bepossible for their staffs to travel to and from their place of employment namely,London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow.Reserve Accommodation.72. The Ministry of Works and Buildings, by agreement with the Treasury,have provided a reserve of approximately 10 per cent of good, steel-framedaccommodation for the headquarters of Government Departments. This accom-modation is not all in the vicinity of Whitehall, but may be described as fairlycentral. Telephones have been fitted, or are in process of being fitted up, and theMinistry of War Transport have been asked to consider the possibility ofproviding a pool of cars in order to facilitate the surface movement of senior officers.It would be impossible, in view of the size of the reserve, to allocate reserveaccommodation to all Departments. The arrangements must be kept flexible, asit is not possible to tell in advance which buildings will be damaged, and it must also be borne in mind that any of the reserve buildings might be knocked out.Nevertheless, here and there, for very special reasons, there is an understandingthat in the event of damage to their buildings certain Departments would naturally expect to go to certain of the reserve buildings if the circumstances thenpermitted.[22879] f 2
If a Department is bombed out the Post Office will, as soon as the circum-stances at the time permit, provide telephone facilities at its new location, if theyare not already available.When any Department is bombed out, it is the responsibility of that Depart-ment to notify its new location and telephone numbers to the other departments with which it is normally in contact. It will not in general be possible fortransferred Departments to retain their telephone numbers when the building to which they are removed is served from a different exchange, and the automaticswitching of calls from the old to the new number presents difficulty when a department is moved to another exchange area, particularly when the number ofexchange lines is large. The Post Office will make arrangements for interceptionas soon as possible, and will give callers information regarding the new number,but to ease the position it is imperative that Departments should notify callersas early as possible about their new numbers.The Ministry of Works and Buildings have arranged for officers to be in attendance day and night to deal with emergency accommodation problems; these officers will have full information as to the location of all bombed-out Depart-ments, and should therefore be able to tell enquirers how to get in touch withany Department at its new headquarters.In addition to the reserve of accommodation provided in London, there is apool of reserve accommodation in a number of principal towns Newcastle,Cardiff, Swansea, Glasgow, Nottingham, Birmingham, Liverpool, Bradford,Leeds, Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield, Hull and Edinburgh.In addition to the steel-framed reserve accommodation in London, there arein second reserve the schools which were prepared under the North-West SuburbScheme. They should provide accommodation for something over 12,000 on a wide arc running from west, through north to north-east London. Communica-tions would be difficult in this case and there is not much in the way of A.R.P.at these schools, but telephones have been provided and billeting would be possiblein the neighbourhood. Resort will be had to this accommodation only if theemergency becomes really very serious.&quot; Citadels:&apos;73. Certain heavily protected accommodation (the &quot; citadels &quot;) has beenprovided to house operational and other essential Government staffs in r grave emergency.These &quot; citadels &quot; have been held in the general reserve of accommodation,but communications have been installed on the basis of a provisional allocation Itis considered essential that, where this has not already been done, the particularstaffs concerned should occupy these citadels with a view to testing the communi-cations and the buildings as a whole under user conditions. If this is not donein advance we are apprehensive that when an emergency move has to be made it will be twenty-four hours in a critical time before the machine can settle downand work at full efficiency.Inter-Departmental Communication.74. The General Post Office can handle urgent messages between Depart-ments, sent either in the form of telegrams or express letters; under invasionconditions such messages would be carried by Post Office Home Guards, whowould use the Post Office tube railway, motor cycles or bicycles, or would proceed on foot, according to circumstances; of the 10,000 Post Office Home Guards, 4,000are not assigned to particular invasion duties, but are held in reserve, and it is from this reserve the messengers would be drawn.The General Post Office cannot, however, undertake to assist in the directtransmission of urgent papers between one Government Department andanother. We understand that consideration is being given to the pooling of theresources of Departments to provide a Central Despatch Rider Service.Regional Commissioners and Provincial Offices.Powers and Duties in Invasion Conditions.75. One of the main reasons for setting up the office of a Regional Commis-sioner was to provide for the contingency that communications between theCentral Government and other parts of the country might become very difficult orimpossible.    Regional Commissioners will naturally endeavour to maintain
communications at all times, and it is anticipated that some means of communica-tion, though probably slow and devious, would remain, and that in any event a breakdown would be temporary in character. It may happen, however, thaturgent decisions have to be taken of a kind which would normally be referred tothe Government for approval, and conditions may make such referenceimpracticable.In the event of invasion, even if communications had not broken down, a situation might arise in which reference to Headquarters would cause dangerousdelay, and in these circumstances the Regional Commissioner would have to actas if the communications had broken down.In order to meet this situation the regional representatives of departments have been authorised to assume certain powers on behalf of their departmentswhen communications are seriously impeded, and to refer to the Commissionerfor his approval, matters which would require the personal authority of theirMinister in the ordinary way before action were taken.The measures to be taken on the Commissioners authority would be of a kind which the Minister has power to take under the existing law, including theDefence Regulations, and they will be taken in the name of the Minister concerned,although the responsibility for deciding or initiating action may have rested withthe Regional Commissioner. Occasionally, other measures might have to be taken under Defence Regulations 16a or 84a. In exceptional cases no legal authority might exist for what had to be done, but if the Regional Commissioner decidedthat such measures had to be taken they would, if necessary, be validatedretrospectively by Parliament.The instructions issued by a number of departments to their regional repre-sentatives lay down, in general, that if a departmental representative is directed by the Regional Commissioner to take some action which he thinks is withinexisting powers, and is compatible with the policy of his Minister, he will carryout the orders of the Regional Commissioner as if they emanated from his own department. If the departmental representative considers that the Commis-sioner&apos;s direction is ultra vires or incompatible with his Minister&apos;s policy, he must either be prepared to accept responsibility for taking the action or representhis views in writing to the Regional Commissioner, and ask for an order inwriting, which he will then obey.Alternative Headquarters for Regional Commissioners.76. Reserve accommodation for Regional Commissioners&apos; Headquarters hasbeen provided either in the Headquarters town or in close proximity thereto. Asit is not possible to foresee precisely the circumstances in which a move might become necessary as a result of invasion, it is not regarded as practicable to select any town as a definite alternative and earmark accommodation in it. Con-sideration is, however, being given to the question of what alternative accommoda-tion would be available in various towns in the event of need, bearing in mind the fact that Post Office buildings, having good communications, will normally be the most suitable for accommodating a nucleus of Regional Commissioner&apos;organisation.Should the enemy threaten to occupy the town in which the Regional Head-quarters is situated, the Regional Commissioner will, if the military authoritiesso advise, move to another town, from which he can effectively exercise his powers in such parts of the Region as remain out of the enemy hands.Telecommunications.77. The General Post Office will be able to provide, by one means or another,for the transmission of urgent messages from the headquaters of GovernmentDepartments to offices in the provinces, and also between such provincial offices.The arrangements for the alternative routeing of telephone and telegraph trafficare such that it should, in almost any circumstances, be possible to maintain somelink for messages, and should communication by telephone, telegraph or wirelessbe impossible the standing arrangements provide for urgent telegrams to be forwarded by courier, by road or by rail, as most appropriate.In the special case of communications between Regional Commissioners andA.R.P. Controllers, the severance of communications will in the first instance bemet by the operation of the despatch rider service provided for each regional headquarters.

The country has been divided into 104 separate zones, in each of whichthere is now held a stock of the more essential foodstuffs, sufficient to last thenormal population of the zone for a period of between 10 and 15 days. stocks in the hands of retailers, which amount to about 12 days&apos; supply, are additional to these reserves. Plans are being prepared for the distribution of the zone stocks to retail shops in an emergency.Those towns which have been classified by the military as Fortress Townshave been provisioned for a siege of between 10 and 21 days. Islands round the coast are being provisioned with the more essential foodstuffs on a scalesufficient to last for 21 days.London has been divided into 29 separate zones and in each of these areasstocks of food are being placed sufficient to last the normal population for 14 days.No account has been taken of stocks which may happen to be in the hands ofretailers.In the Coastal Belt conditions may make it impossible for stock to be distributed to retail shops and accordingly stocks are being placed in every townand village which has no bulk stock within its boundaries, sufficient to subsist thepopulation for a minimum period of 5 days. In an emergency this reserve couldbe eked out to 10 days. In general, it can be said that all villages and towns inthe Coastal Belt will have sufficient food within their boundaries to feed thenormal population for a minimum period of 18 days. Distribution in all areas should be complete by 7th September.All local authorities in areas with populations of 50.000 or more hold stocksof food for emergency feeding purposes sufficient to subsist 10 per cent, of thepopulation for four days. This reserve is also held by certain local authoritiesin the more vulnerable areas. In addition to these local reserves there will beestablished by 1st September reserves of bulk foodstuffs at various strategic pointsthroughout the country.Apart from the stocks so disposed, each Divisional Food Officer has under his personal control a supply of mixed foodstuffs stored at a number of points in his Division which he is permitted to use only in the last resort, In theaggregate the foodstuffs in these dumps are sufficient in an emergency to subsist10 million people for 3 days.Without imposing an undue strain on our resources it is not possible to caterin advance for the position which might arise if an area is cut off by the enemy.Preliminary arrangements have, however, been made so that if Air Forcecommitments allow, supplies could be dropped in localities of essential operationalimportance still held by our troops. Supplies thus dropped would, of course,be distributed by the military commander to all personnel within the defendedperimeter; civilians as well as military.Any action of this kind would be proposed only as a last resort and wouldbe initiated by the military.   We must, however, put on record the view of the
representative of the Air Staff on the Committee that it is in the highest degreeimprobable that aircraft could be spared from operational duties in thecircumstances contemplated.Gas-contaminated Foodstuffs.79. A Gas Contamination Officer trained in the detection and treatmentof foodstuffs containing poison gas has been appointed by every local authority.All local authorities principally concerned have recruited and trained a numberof volunteers who will work under the supervision of the Gas ContaminationOfficers, and have prepared special decontamination sites and transport facilities.Control.80. In each region there is a Divisional Food Officer in close liaison withthe Regional Commissioner. Liaison between Commands and the DivisionalFood Organisation is maintained through Chief Divisional Food Officers, one ofwhom covers each Army command, with the exception of the South-Eastern and eastern Commands, which are covered by one Chief Divisional Food Officer.Provision for contact between Area, Sub-Area and local Military Commandersand Divisional and Local Food Officers has been made.In the event of a Food Division being cut off from communication with theMinistry of Food, the Divisional Food Officer is empowered to assume theMinister&apos;s functions. To meet the contingency that control by the DivisionalFood Officer may break down owing to the cutting of communications, it has beendecided to provide in every town, village and hamlet in the Coastal Belt a responsible person who will assume full control of food supplies in the event ofthe area for which he is responsible being cut off from communication with the outside world. In the majority of cases the responsible person will be the FoodExecutive Officer, but in the smaller villages where the problems of food distribution are relatively simple a specially appointed Voluntary FoodOrganizer will assume control. While communications within the Region hold,these officials will be subject to the control of the Divisional Food Officer. thus in vulnerable areas where it is intended to distribute the Coastal Belt Reserveat &quot;Action Stations &quot; it may be presumed that the distribution will be underthe general control of the Divisional Food Officer, since it is improbable thatRegional communications will have been cut at this stage.The power to order the closing of shops for stock-taking (subsequentdistribution being under control of local Food Officials) may have to be exercised by local officials in invasion areas, since this step may be taken at a relatively latestage. The closing of shops in other areas to check panic buying would be orderedat the discretion of the Divisional Food Officer.The Ministry of Food are now arranging for the extension of the VoluntaryFood Organizer system to inland areas.Water Supply.81. In areas with piped supplies and water carriage sanitation the consump-tion of water for drinking and other domestic purposes is 20 or more gallons per head per day. In rural areas without piped supplies, the average is about 5gallons. For essential needs in emergency, consumption for ordinary domesticuse can safely be reduced to 1 to 2 gallons per head per day.In defence against bombing, the objective is the speedy restoration&quot; of thepiped supply. This entails the provision of adequate quantities of spare pipescoupled with some duplication here and there of pumping plant, the developmentof inter-connections between undertakings, arrangements for water to be suppliedthrough standpipes and by cartage pending repair of mains, and, of course, a callon the labour needed for repairs. Invasion, however, presents rather a differentproblem. An important factor in the situation is that the source of town supply is frequently not in the town itself and may be many miles away. Thus,Birmingham is supplied from Wales, Manchester from the Lake&quot; District!Whitstable from Canterbury, and so on. In invasion, it may obviously benecessary to rely on purely local supplies.Where the normal source is not itself in the town, there is usually within oron the fringe of the town one or more service reservoirs holding perhaps a day&apos;s
normal consumption, sometimes more, sometimes less. Storage tanks in houses,containing about one day&apos;s normal consumption, constitute a further reserve; theyare, however, seldom found in the North of England. There are very often privatewells of substantial yield at e.g., breweries, laundries, hospitals, factories. Theremay also be lesser wells, and a river, stream, lake or ponds. In some places watercan be got from mine workings. In dire emergency almost any water (exceptsalt) is drinkable if boiled or chlorinated, though if it is heavily polluted theheavy chlorine dose may make it somewhat unpalatable.Water Undertakings have been asked to survey possible emergency sourcesfrom which potable water can be obtained, including rivers, streams and privatewells, and to do such preparatory work as may be necessary to bring these sourcesinto commission; the Ministry of Health&apos;s Regional Engineering Inspectors havekept in close touch with the&quot; undertakings on this. In the London Region, forexample, the Metropolitan Water Board are completing a survey of private wellsand making agreements with the owners of such wells as are suitable for publicsupplies.   The Ministry will invoke compulsory powers if necessary.In a number of cases, particularly in the large towns, the water undertakingshave purchased portable tanks for distribution where mains are broken, and moreare on order. The Regional Transport Commissioners have instructions to makevehicles available to carry the tanks. There has also been a good deal of inter-connection of mains, with the object of mutual aid m emergency between under-takings.The public have been instructed, in connection with preparations to meetheavy air attack, to store water in their baths and other receptacles. these instructions will be repeated when invasion appears imminent.Provision in &quot; Nodal Points.&quot;   (See Annex II, paragraph 23.)82. In the South-Eastern Region over 60 &quot;nodal points&quot; and fortresstowns designated by the military have received special attention. Wells havebeen reconditioned; arrangements have been made for chlorination of well, river and pond water; materials have been provided for building small dams onstreams; where necessary, storage tanks have been installed. This work ispractically complete. The capital cost is being met in full by the Government onthe ground that the work is required primarily for military reasons. similar arrangements are now being made in the Eastern Region, and it is possible that proposals with regard to &quot; nodal points &quot; or &quot; tank-islands &quot; may be put forwardtry the military in other Regions also. Some preparation of this type has already-been made in the Bristol area.It is, however, impossible to say, or secure in any reasonable time and at areasonable cost, that in all circumstances every part of every town, or every village,which might be surrounded by the enemy will have its independent water supply.Approved nodal points will have their special supplies, but where, e.g., the nodalpoint is the centre of the town and the normal water supply is quite outside thetown, then, if the enemy cuts the normal supply, any inhabitants who stay in thepart of the town outside the nodal point, may have to rely on what is in theirhouse storage tanks (where these exist) and whatever they have stored in theirbaths or other receptacles on being warned to do so.Local Government Services.83. Under invasion conditions the main duty of all local government services will continue to be the control, instruction and assistance of the civil population.It is not, however, possible to separate this function from that of assistance tothe military; for example, the maintenance of efficient A.R.P. and fire-fightingservices and of effective police control is essential if panic refugee movements, withtheir inevitable effect on the freedom of movement of the military, are to be prevented. Further, there will undoubtedly be occasions when the military requirethe direct assistance of one or other of these services for example, the passageof troops may be blocked by bomb damage or by a conflagration; in such an event,the military need will take priority over the civil one for example, rescue parties would in the first instance clear a blocked road for the military, and turn later to the rescue of casualties.The machinery for this co-operation of local government services with the militaryis outlined in Annex II (i) paras. 3 and 4.  Since it is essential for such co-operation
that the local government services concerned should have complete freedom of movement, it has been agreed that police vehicles, fire engines, ambulances and civil defence vehicles should receive military priority on the roads, and should continueto circulate when even EX. label traffic is suspended. To identify such vehicles,many of which are adapted private cars, functional markings are being-introduced.   The scheme is described in more detail in Annex IV, paragraph 55.Police.84. The general principles governing the position of the police in the caseof invasion are (a) that the police are not part of the armed forces of the Crown, and that therefore, in the event of a landing and effective occupation of an area by the enemy in force, the police should not use arms, nor carry arms,in the occupied area; but(b) that in the event of a landing by isolated parties who do not form partof an occupying force and whose object is, or must be assumed to be,to attack civilians, destroy property and cause confusion anddevastation, neither the police nor civilians are debarred, either by international law or domestic law, from resisting and, if possible,destroying the enemy in order to prevent him carrying out these objects.In some contingencies the distinction between the situations which have been indicated above would be clear; in others they might not be so easy to draw; butthe general rules applicable to them may be summarised in general terms as setout below.If there is a landing and occupation by the enemy in force : (a) In the event of evacuation being ordered from the threatened area beforethe landing takes place : (i) the main body of the police should assist in controlling themovement, and, if not required for any local duties, should withdraw, taking with them any arms which may have beenprovided for police use; they should then place themselves at thedisposal of the military authorities,(ii) a rear guard of police should be detailed to assist the civil authorities and the civil population, so long as any remain, toensure that all necessary measures have been carried out and toguard against agents making contact with the enemy. Whenno longer required for these duties or to assist the militaryauthorities, this rear guard also should withdraw by such routeas may have been pre-arranged with the military authorities.(b) If no measures have been taken for the evacuation of the civil population from the threatened area, or if any elements of the civil populationremain in the area after the military forces withdraw : (i) as many members of the police force as can be spared and are notrequired by the military authorities to stay should withdraw,taking with them any arms which may have been provided for police use.(ii) a rear guard of police should remain behind.   Their instructions should be to ensure that the civil population conform to anyorders which may have been previously issued, e.g., as toremaining where they are, and generally to do everything intheir power to assist the civil authorities and the civilians whoremain.(c) Any rear guard of police detailed to remain behind in an area occupiedby the enemy should consist, so far as possible, of men who are overmilitary age and whose families have not been evacuated.Ftre Services.85. The Regional Commissioner, in consultation wdth the MilitaryAuthorities, would be expected to decide whether, and if so to what extent and[22879] g
with what equipment, a fire brigade should withdraw from a threatened area.If the civil population is evacuated, fire brigades have been instructed to remain at their posts, unless and until instructions to leave are given to them by the regional Commissioner or Military Authorities. Failing special instructionsfire brigades and their auxiliary services, in the event of the occupation of any area appearing imminent, would remove such fire appliances as can be sparedwith their crews, leaving a skeleton service whose strength would depend on theextent to which the civilian population was remaining in the area.A.R.P. Services.86. The principles governing the conduct of the A.R.P. Services in invasionmay be summarised as follows : (a) The A.R.P. Services exist normally to meet the needs of the civilpopulation; and in so far as the general public are expected to stayput the A.R.P. Services should remain also. As an attempted landingwould probably be preceded by and accompanied by heavy air attack,these services would be urgently required just before and while a landing was taking place and their work might be in direct support and under the orders of local military commanders. In certaincircumstances the chief role of the A.R.P. Services might be theopening up and maintaining of certain vital road communicationsrequired by the Military forces and this task might have to take precedence over other more normal work (see Annex II, para. 16).(b) The A.R.P. Services are not a combatant force, but the military authori-ties may require the exclusive use of certain services, vehicles orequipment for purposes described in sub-paragraph (a) above,(c) A.R.P. vehicles and equipment which might be used by the enemy formilitary purposes, and so be diverted from their proper use, shouldbe removed, if the local Military Commander agrees that this can bedone without interfering with military movements, or rendered useless to the enemy by the removal of some essential part.Local A uthorities.87. Local Authorities have been told that in the event of invasion theyshould carry on with their essential duties to the civil population, especially their civil Defence duties. If fighting breaks out in the area of a local authority, localGovernment Officers will stand firm and continue those services which the circum-stances and the military needs of the situation require.Provision for Evacuated Persons and Refugees.Compulsory Evacuation Scheme.88. If requested by the Regional Commissioner, the Ministry of Food willsend emergency foodstuffs to entraining centres.Reception areas have been earmarked for those removed under the compulsoryevacuation scheme and the arrangements provide for initial reception, subsequentdistribution into billets or requisitioned houses, and for sheltering and feedinguntil the process of distribution can be completed. Public Health Authoritiesin the receiving areas have been instructed to make all health services administered by them fully available to all evacuees coming into these areas, any additionalexpense incurred being recoverable from the Exchequer.The facilities of British Restaurants and Emergency Feeding Centres willbe available for evacuees, and, if necessary, additional supplies of bulk foodstuffscan be directed into the reception areas.Evacuees who are in need of cash assistance will be dealt with by the local offices of the Ministry of Labour under the Refugee Payments Scheme. TheMinistry of Labour will open temporary offices in the reception areas for thepayment of allowances and the registration and distribution to employment ofemployable persons. The arrangements which have been made in this connectionhave been advanced as far as possible in the earmarked areas and can be put intooperation without delay in any area, e.g., in the event of panic evacuation.
The payment of cash assistance under the Refugee Payments Scheme is atemporary expedient, and will be terminated when the officers of the assistance board have had time to assess the needs of individual persons and to determine whether they are entitled to allowances under the scheme for Prevention and relief of Distress. The influx of a large number of refugees will severely tax theBoard&apos;s local resources, but, as the numbers to be dealt with cannot be estimated in advance, it is not possible to make full prior arrangements. The magnitude of the task in any area will, however, become known to the Board&apos;s officers whenthe refugees arrive and, subject to other and more urgent calls on the staff, theBoard will then take whatever steps are practicable to reinforce the local staff(see also para. 96).Refugee Emergency Services, &amp;c.89. As far as possible the services listed above will be made available toany person who reaches a reception area, but removal under the Refugee scheme will inevitably be carried out in much more difficult, conditions than the compulsory Evacuation Scheme, and it has been deemed necessary to provide forthe shelter and feeding of refugees on the assumption that their journey will besubject to interruptions and delays.When a refugee problem arises, officers on the Regional staff of the Ministryof Health will proceed to the entraining stations to make such arrangements asmay be practicable, in the event of transport breaking down, for the shelter ofthe refugees in districts within reach of the entraining point and for the distri-bution of food supplied by the Divisional Officers of the Ministry of Food.Provision for unorganised refugees presents a much more difficult problem.If they migrate to the large towns they will be fed at Rest Centres conducted bythe Public Assistance Authorities and at British Restaurants and EmergencyFeeding Centres. But many people would probably roam over the countrysidefor several days before they reached towns of any size, and must inevitably throwconsiderable strain upon the Rural Organisation. It is practically impossibleto chart the movement of these refugees in advance and to provide food and cooking facilities at suitable points in readiness. The Food Organisation fortu-nately is very elastic, and without giving any guarantee it is hoped that it willbe possible, in the event, to feed refugees in the Rural Areas (in so far as theycannot be fed by Public Assistance Authorities) by means of Food Convoys.Mobile Canteens and by the expedient of employing Mobile Kitchen equipment which can be set up within an hour or two at any point at which a number of refugees have congregated. Plans are now being prepared with this end in view,and consideration is also being given to the equipment now of a number ofrailway wagons or restaurant-cars which could be kept on sidings at suitablepoints. If, as a result of inter-Departmental discussion, it is decided that thisproposal is practicable, it should not be impossible to bring the plan to an advancedstate of readiness by the 1st September. It should be borne in mind that all these plans would break down completely should it be found necessary, on military grounds, to prohibit the movement of the civilian transport which would berequired.Production and Distribution of Consumers&apos; Goods.90. The Board of Trade have selected from their Headquarters&apos; staff anumber of Emergency Regional Officers to represent the Department in eachCivil Defence Region. These Officers have already visited their Regions to make contact, and they will take up their posts on receipt of &quot; Stand to.&quot;These Officers will have full power to take action on matters within theresponsibility of the Board of Trade, and have had the necessary authority underthe Defence Regulations delegated to them. Their authority will extend to all matters connected with the production and distribution, through wholesale and retail channels, of consumers&apos; goods other than food and certain other goods, e.g.,medical supplies, which are covered by special arrangements made by otherDepartments. They will have power to control prices of particular goods in theirrespective areas and, if necessary, to requisition stocks of goods in short supply.The Board of Trade is already represented in Regions by its representatives on Regional Boards. The Emergency Officers will act in co-operation with these[22879] ^ g 3
representatives, with the Area Distribution Officers of the Board of Trade andwith such Regional bodies as the Local Price Regulation Committees in all ques-tions arising out of their normal functions. Close touch will also be kept betweenEmergency Officers and Regional Gas Engineering Advisers on all matters affecting the maintenance of gas supplies.Post Office Services.91. Instructions for the maintenance of Post Office Services to the publicunder war conditions are held by the officers concerned. They are designed tocover all emergencies likely to arise during the progress of a war, e.g., the settingup of emergency routes for telephone, telegraph and postal traffic if the normalcirculation were interfered with, the maintenance of the various financial andremittance services if communications with the Headquarters Departmentsthrough which they are normally conducted are interrupted, the conduct of certain specified services for other Government Departments, and the setting up ofEmergency Headquarters, &amp;c. Orders to act on these instructions might be issued from Headquarters, or they might be brought into operation on local initiative.In the Post Office organisation wide powers are delegated to Regional Directors,and they are encouraged to act on their own initiative; emergency services would therefore be set up if necessary without delay, even if communication withHeadquarters were interrupted.Distribution of News and Issue of Communiques.92. As at present arranged, communiques will be drafted on the basis ofmaterial sent to them from the Service Departments by Air Ministry officials(A.I. 6) working at the Cabinet Offices, aided, if necessary, by liaison officers fromthe Ministry of Information. A communique will be issued in a numbered seriesevery evening, covering events up to the morning of the same day. Any altera-tions made to the contributions sent in by Service Departments will have to bereferred back to those Departments for sanction. Contact with Home forces will be through the War Office. The communiques will be passed to the Ministryof Information and distributed in the normal way. The regular series of dailycommuniques does not exclude the issue of special communiques at other times.We do not regard these plans as completely satisfactory, and we understand thatthey are being reviewed.93. As regards the distribution of news, no special plans have been pre-pared with a view to invasion. The arrangements for distributing news to theprovincial Press from London have recently been reviewed with a view to improving the efficiency of these communications in emergency. Alternativeroutes exist to the main centres;; and if London is isolated, there are severalprovincial centres capable of originating messages over all those parts of thePress Association network which are still in operation. Censors are stationed at those centres.Plans have been prepared for the distribution of news in each Region by theMinistry&apos;s Regional Officers in the event of the Press breaking down altogether.There are alternative channels for conveying news from the Ministry to itsRegional Officers, and it is thought unlikely that all these will fail. If a RegionalInformation Officer is unable to establish communication with headquarters, hewill, subject to the direction of the Regional Commissioner, compile bulletins from such information as is available at Regional headquarters. In this event, contact with Home Forces will be made through the military liaison officer at regional headquarters. The General Officer Commanding will supply the military informa-tion and will have the right to veto anything which he considers prejudicial to hisoperations. The plans for passing out the news inside the Regions differ fromRegion to Region, according to the local conditions.A number of war correspondents have been nominated by the Press and plans have been made to warn these men firstly to stand to and then to meet at an agreedrendezvous on the receipt of give code words.   , 0
Official Announcements.94. Under the aegis of the Ministry of Information, the instructions which government Departments may wish to issue on the approach of the incidence of invasion are being collected and the arrangements for their release co-ordinated.Schools.95. On invasion, day schools in the area of operations and, as may benecessary, in areas immediately adjacent, will be closed. Instructions for the closing of schools will be issued by the Regional Commissioner Boarding schools will not be dispersed.  Elsewhere, schools will remain open.Transport may be affected over a wider area, and if difficulties arise in thecase of children who normally travel or are conveyed to school, authorities will, sofar as possible, arrange for them to attend schools nearer their homes or billets.The Regional Commissioners are being supplied with information which willenable them to get into touch with all Day Schools in their Regions which are within the purview of the Board of Education.The Offices of the Regional Commissioners do not include representatives ofthe Board, but the Board&apos;s Divisional Inspectors have been instructed to reportto the Regional Commissioners&apos; Offices immediately on the notification of &quot; stand to &quot; in order that their advice may be available on any problems affecting theschool population and schools and in regard to the emergency use of the organisa-tion and staff of Local Education Authorities.Similar arrangements have been made by the Scottish Education Department.State Social Services.Assistance Board Payments.96. The Assistance Board are concerned with the payment of Unemploy-ment Assistance, Supplementary Pensions, Prevention and Relief of Distressgrants, War Damage Compensation advances, and Injury allowances. In respectof all these their organisation is in the highest degree decentralised; the countryis divided into 500 Areas, in each of which there is an Area Office handling all thework arising in that Area; in the great majority of cases Area Offices do not haveto communicate with anyone outside the Area, and while in normal times it wouldbe necessary for them to seek advice from the District Office or from Headquarterson more difficult cases, such central references could be dispensed with underinvasion conditions. Thus, the Assistance Board machine will continue to function unless and until there is a breakdown in local communication. If andwhen such a breakdown occurs, the local situation will presumably havedeteriorated to such an extent that the provision of cash assistance becomesinappropriate, and at this stage the place of the Assistance Board&apos;s services would be taken by assistance in kind provided by the Public Assistance Authority.Public Assistance Authorities.97. The Public Assistance Authorities and their officers have the duty of granting such relief as may be necessary in cases for which no provision is madeby the Assistance Board, including the duty of granting relief in kind in all casesof sudden or urgent necessity. The authorities are the Councils of Counties and county Boroughs in England and Wales and of the similar areas in Scotland (atotal of 200 for the whole of Great Britain), and. they woru through relievingofficers who are readily available in all places in which distress is likely to occur.The Public Assistance Authorities are responsible also for the rest centreservice for persons made homeless by enemy action. Large numbers of buildingsall over the country, particularly in and around the bombing! target areas, havebeen prepared as rest centres into which homeless people are received if they havenowhere else to go. They are provided temporarily with food and somewhere tosleep until arrangements can be made for billeting or otherwise accommodatingthem. The rest centre service would be available also for people who are not actually homeless but leave their homes in vulnerable areas because of bombing.Being operated by the local authorities, severally and in co-operation, it is
independent of central and, to a great extent, of regional direction. The servicecould therefore continue to function under invasion conditions, but a complete breakdown of local communications would seriously impair its efficiency.Health Insurance Benefits.98. Free medical treatment will be available to insured persons in the newareas to which they may remove under the Compulsory Evacuation or RefugeeEmergency Service schemes. No special arrangements have been made as regardscash benefits, the payment of which depends on the maintenance of postal arrange-ments, &amp;c, but if these arrangements should break down in any looality thepersons concerned would have to fall back on the Prevention and Relief of distress Scheme of the Assistance Board.Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Pensions.99. A pension can be drawn not only at the Post Office named on the cover ofthe order book, but at any other Post Office in England, Wales or Scotland. If allthe orders in the book have been cashed and the new book is not to hand, the pensioner will, on production of the stub of the old book, continue to be paidpension week by week until the new book arrives.As regards new claims to pension, power has been taken to make a provisionalaward in any case in which, owing to circumstances arising out of the war, it isnot possible to determine whether the statutory conditions for award are satisfied.Pensions to the Dependants of Casualties.100. Since the main headquarters of the Ministry of Pensions is now atBlackpool, there is little likelihood of the machinery for the allocation of pensions to the dependants of Service casualties becoming interrupted except in ares which are the scene of fighting. The preliminary work in the case of battlecasualties is simpler than that which has to be done on disease cases, which atpresent constitute the greater portion of the Ministry of Pensions work, and,therefore, provided there is no difficulty about the reporting of casualties to theMinistry, the payment of pensions should not be unduly delayed. To fill the gap in any case where the payment of a pension is held up, the Assistance Board&apos;arrangements for the prevention and relief of distress will be available for pay-ments on the basis of need.The Ministry of Pensions are also responsible for the payment of temporaryallowances to widows of gainfully occupied persons who are killed by enemy action. During invasion it may not be possible for this machinery to function in areas which are seriously affected by military operations, but in this event alsothe Assistance Board&apos;s arrangements will be available to fill the gap.Bomb Disposal Organisation.101. Regional Commissioners are responsible for receiving and co-ordi-nating reports of unexploded bombs and mines, deciding on the degree of urgency,and allotting the priority classification for disposal. The disposal of unexplodedbombs is carried out by specialist Army Bomb Disposal Units (except on land under Admiralty or Ajr Ministry control, where it is carried out by Naval or air Force personnel respectively).&apos; Unexploded mines are disposed of by navalparties.After &quot; Action Stations &quot; overriding military priorities may be imposed bythe General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Command concerned. these will be notified to the Regional Commissioner, who will be responsible for super-imposing them upon the priorities allotted by him. After &quot; Action Stations,&apos;&quot;mines will be dealt with by Bomb Disposal Units.Plans have been made for the decentralisation of these arrangements on boththe military and the civil side, so that bomb disposal may continue despite the breakdown of comniunications.iProgress of Voluntary Squads.102. Considerable progress has been made with the formation of AuxiliaryBomb Disposal Units in large factories, and installations. These units arecomposed of volunteers from employees, the leader being trained at the Army
Bomb Disposal School. They carry out the detection and reporting of unexplodedbombs in their factory, demarcation and evacuation of the clanger area, protec-tive sandbagging, and preliminary digging and ancillary work in conjunctionwith the Military bomb disposal units. Over 100 such units have been formed,and the managements of some further 500 large factories have already expressed their willingness to set up units in their factories and to send a squad leader fortraining.  An extension of the scheme is now in preparation.Movement of Civilians.103. Two kinds of pass are issued in present circumstances to facilitate the movement of workers and others who may have to satisfy the military or thepolice of their bona fides. These are Form D.R. 12, which is issued to persons whose duties take them into protected places, and Form D.R. 20, which is forgeneral issue to persons engaged in essential war services or in work of vitalimportance to the life and well-being of the community, whose movement it isimportant to expedite.It is not intended to expand the issue of the latter pass in invasion to coverall essential workers. Apart from the fact that the issue of passes would be no more necessary in the greater part of the country where production can be main-tained than it is now, the delays and dislocations inseparable from the operationof a system of this kind would more than counterbalance the security advantages to be gained.It is contemplated that in some cases it may be necessary to declare curfewsin invasion conditions, and these will be imposed by Regional Commissionersunder Defence Regulation 16a in consultation with military commanders.As invasion would almost certainly be accompanied by heavy air attack, itmay be necessary to prohibit indoor and outdoor entertainments involving thecongregation of large numbers of people. Instructions on the point will be issuedby the Ministry of Home Security in the light of existing circumstances.
