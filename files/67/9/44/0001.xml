From the point of view of shelter policy, the following are the mostinteresting points : (a) There is no evidence that for the most part the attacks were directed against specific objectives.(b) There was a tendency for an increased proportion of the bombs to be ofheavier types than those used in the earlier part of the war.(c) The resistance of brickwork to blast and splinters was better thanoriginally expected, but the effects of earth shock were greater.(d) The protection afforded by framed buildings was confirmed, and in thecase of the multiple-storeyed buildings is not limited to the lowestfloors.(e) The value of properly constructed Anderson shelters was confirmed.(/) Surface shelters constructed of unreinforced brickwork were speciallyliable to damage from earth shock and, if badly constructed, to damage from blast.(g) Strutted basements in unframed buildings generally withstood the straiDfor which they were primarily designed (debris load from the collapse of the upper part of the house), but were exposed to sideways strainfrom earth shock against which they had not been designed.(h) The importance of sub-dividing large shelters so as to reduce calamityrisk was emphasized.3. The bearing of this experience on shelter design became apparent at anearly stage, and has already been embodied in new designs and in instructions to technical officers of the Department and of local authorities on the strengthening of existing shelters. There remain, however, a number of problems, connectedparticularly with the effect of eai&apos;th shock, for which a satisfactory solution hasnot yet been found, and these are still the subject of experiment.4. This is the third of a series of Appreciations, but the two previousAppreciations have not been of sufficient general interest to be worth circulatingto the War Cabinet.H. M.Home Office, May 5, 1941.[22455]b
THIRD APPRECIATION OF AIR RAIDS,  WITH  special reference  TO  LONDON.THIS Appreciation covers the months of September, October and November,when the main weight of enemy attack was directed on London, though some ofthe lessons learnt in the recent mass raids on Coventry and other towns areincluded.The attack on London.The raids on London were clearly part of a planned attack aimed at the centre of resistance in the country. Starting at full strength on the 7th September, theycontinued unabated for two months, petering out and changing their character in mid-November, coincident with the appearance of the new type of raid on Coventryand other cities.The general characters of the raids were their intensity, their local concen-tration and their persistency. These were largely imposed by the conditions of night bombing where individual targets could not be picked out. Incendiaryattacks, starting large fires, were used at first, but then largely abandoned, onlyto be taken up much later in other cities.A good picture of the attacks is given by the returns of bombs* dropped inthe various boroughs. Though incomplete for the first weeks in many boroughs,they become progressively more accurate later. From the middle of Novemberwe have the much greater detail of the bomb census giving some idea of the weightas well as the location of every bomb. The result of these surveys is shown inMaps I, II, III and IV, giving the density of bombing in number of bombs per100 acres, for the months of September, October and November, and for the threetogether.The maps show the concentration of bombs on certain target areas, and the wide spread of less intense bombing over the whole area. The target areas didnot remain the same; successive maps show a drift from the East End and theriverside boroughs in September to Central London in October and to more diffuseand less intense raiding in November. The area heavily bombed at any time wasvery restricted. In September, two compact areas, one Eastern, containing the boroughs of Holborn, City, Stepney, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Southwark, Ber-mondsey and Deptford, and one Western, containing Fuiham and Chelsea, werethe only regions where the density of bombs was more than one per ten acres. InStepney there were two per ten acres. In October only three boroughs, Holborn,Shoreditch and Bethnal Green, had more than one bomb per ten acres, while thearea heavily bombed (8 bombs per 100 acres) comprised only Bermondsey, Stepney,Bethnal Green, Shoreditch, Finsbury, City, Holborn, Westminster and Chelsea.The centralised nature of the attacks on London is shown in Figs. 1 and by plotting the average density of bombs against the distance from London Bridge,which is approximately the centre of the most heavily bombed area. The curvesshow how rapidly the danger diminished with distance. At four miles away thebomb density is half, at ten only one-eighth of the density at the centre. Thisheavy bombing of central areas, also shown in many of the provincial raids, isnot the most effective in destroying industrial targets, but it is presumably aimed at the centres of administration and communications, which are also at the centres of population.Owing to their larger area, the total number of bombs dropped in the outerboroughs of London exceeded that of the centre, but owing to the lower densityof buildings and population, they did far less damage and hurt far fewer people(see below, on casualties).Detailed studj&apos; of bomb location fails to show any systematic bombing ofparticular objectives except in the few day raids by individual planes.   Objectives* Throughout this report &quot; bombs &quot; means &quot;high-explosive bombs &quot; unless otherwise stated.MINISTRY OF HOME  SECURITY.Research and Experiments Department.
were generalised : the docks, the power stations, the administrative and com-mercial centres, the network of railway systems. The factory zone seems to havebeen very little affected. Though hospitals, public buildings and railway stations were repeatedly hit, it would seem to be entirely by chance, since no concentration of bombs in their neighbourhood can be detected.As the raids developed the main objective may have changed from wiping outthe docks, power stations and railway system, in which they clearly failed, totrying to produce general transport and administrative chaos. To do this, it wasnecessary to maintain the attack at a high enough level: any slackening wouldgive time for repair to overtake destruction. The intensity, however, was nevergreat enough, although it may have come close to it on a few days, and it was neverkept at this peak value for more than a few days at a time.Weight of attack.The total enemy effort in the London raids is difficult to estimate exactly, butit would seem that some 10,120 bombs, representing about 1,290 tons of bombs,were dropped in the London region in September, 9,957 bombs in October and only7,463 in November, giving 27,540 bombs or 3,440 tons of bombs in all. Thesefigures, though large, are only a small fraction of those the enemy claimed tohave dropped in the period. For example, the tonnage claimed for Novemberalone was 3,187. Such claims are probably mere propaganda. They mayrepresent bombs intended for London but not those dropped there. It is extremelydangerous to use them, as they have been used, to prove the ineffectiveness of enemy bombing. It has actually been very effective but there has not been so muchof it, and intenser raids are possible.General effects.The effects of the raids can be considered as the transient and the durable.The transient effects were those on morale and general disorganisation. Londonpeople lost much sleep and suffered anxiety and discomfort, but there was no break-down, no panic and no mass evacuation, except from small heavily bombed areas.The effect was one very largely of surprise. After a few days the first horror ofthe raids wore off and people became adjusted to the new conditions of shelter life.Disorganisation was more serious. The complicated network of railwayswas cut at many places at once. In three weeks, one hundred and four railway bridges were put out of action for periods ranging from a day to a month. Roadswere blocked by craters and debris. Thousands of water and gas mains werebroken, interrupting supplies over large areas. (4,124 water mains were brokenin the three months&apos; raiding). Telephone exchanges were put out of action andpostal deliveries hampered.In the earlier raids, this was made much worse by the presence, and evenmore the imagined presence, of unexploded bombs, which effectively sterilisedwhole areas and multiplied the number of homeless to be dealt with. This dis-organisation was at first cumulative, but after the first few weeks, partly from theslackening of the raids and partly from adjustments to raid conditions, it wasgradually overcome.The durable effect of the London raids has been the killing of some 13,000persons, the wounding of some 50,000, the destruction of some 20,000 dwellingnouses*, and a proportionate number of other buildings, and the serious damage tosome five times that number. Nearly all the damage done to railways is reparableand most of it was repaired before the end of the year. Only one power station was out of action for several weeks. Many warehouses have been destroyed,mostly by fire. No important factory has been destroyed, and in only a few ofthem has production seriously diminished. Chaotic passenger and goods traffic was probably more effective, as a retarding factor, than direct damage in theearly weeks.These results seem small only in relation to the vastness of the population and wealth of London. Absolutely, the loss of life and property is serious andcalls for the greatest efforts to reduce the damage to persons and property.Types of Bombs.A very definite change in bombing tactics from that used in earlier raids is apparent in the raids on London.   From the very beginning, the proportion of* This figure is calculated from a limited sample and is probably an understatement.       &apos;[22455] b 2
different types of bombs used tended towards heavier bombs than those used inthe earlier part of the war. We now know that throughout all the raids very heavy bomb types of 1,000, 1,400 and 1,800 kg. have been used, naturally in small numbers. About three-quarters of the bombs were of 50 kg., but more than two-thirds by weight were of 250 kg. or over, the average bomb weight beingestimated as 130 kg.The other characteristic feature was the large-scale use of parachute mines,of which over 150 are reported to have been dropped in the London area in the months of September, October and November. Incendiary bombs, including the oil explosive incendiary bomb, were used in considerable numbers, but until theraids of the 2nd and 4th December, they were never the main feature of any attack in the period under review. An unpleasant development has been the attachmentof a small explosive charge to the 1 kg. incendiary bomb.The comparative damage done by the bombs of different weights is shown inTable 1, though the figures for large bombs are necessarily based on very few cases. The most noticeable feature is that the effect of ground shock increasesrelatively to the crater size with the larger bombs, though the area affected by a given weight of bombs is roughly the same for all but the 50 kg. bomb. for damage to services, however, the small bombs are more effective than the large.Parachute Mines.The damage done by parachute mines falling in dense urban districts is very extensive, but is of a characteristic superficial nature. No houses have been completely destroyed further away than 100 feet from such mines, and thoughhouses may be made completely unusable, by the destruction of roofs andpartitions, up to about 300 feet, the lower floors are usually undamaged and the casulties extremely small considering the weight of explosive used. The deathsrange from none to twenty-five (except in one case where a large strutted basementcollapsed), averaging at about six, and most casualties are light. The effect onunderground shelters is very small. One mine exploded within 15 feet of areinforced concrete shelter without causing even slight injuries to any of itsoccupants, and persons in Anderson shelters have also been uninjured at 30 feet.There have been, however, serious effects on badly-built brick surface shelters atdistances up to 200 feet. (See below under Shelters.) The most serious effect ofthe mines is probably in the very extensive window breakage, and undoubtedlythey make life more uncomfortable for a larger number of people than any bomb.Delayed action bombs.In September, the delayed action bombs contributed very much to the generaldisorganisation and distress. This was largely a result of the general ignoranceas to how to detect them, and for about a week hundreds were reported which hadno existence except in imagination. Main-line railway stations were held up forlong periods on account of these imagined unexploded bombs. In the beginning,also, the organisation to deal with them was not on a scale comparable to thenumber really dropped. With the rapid development of the Bomb Disposal Squadand with the general education of the A.R.P. staffs in the reporting of the bombs,this difficulty was overcome.It would appear that about 7 per cent, of bombs dropped fail to explode; ofthese only a small proportion (12 per cent, of all bombs and about 40 per cent, of250 kg. bombs) are fitted with delayed action fuses. The total proportion ofdelayed action bombs, mostly 250 kg., is certainly larger, as an unknown numberexplode before being dealt with; but even supposing half did so, only 1-75 percent, of bombs would be of the delayed action type, or about one in sixty. Thegreat majority of unexploded bombs are duds.Damage to Buildings.The experience of London has furnished us with extremely varied types of damage, and it is now possible to estimate with fair accuracy the kind of damage to be expected from different types of bombs on houses, buildings and otherstructures.The three principal effects of bomb explosion-blast, splinters and groundshock are instrumental to very different degrees in destroying buildings.   Blast,
except from parachute mines, has little effect for even heavy bombs bursting out-side buildings, but it is the most potent source of destruction for bombs burstinginside owing to the confinement of the explosion.Splinters individually have little effect on structures. Code thicknesses ofmaterials have proved adequate to keep out all but a few of the heaviest of them.Near the bomb a group of splinters close together may have very considerable effect. Load-bearing walls may be so undercut as to collapse on the impact of theblast wave. Even from a 50 kg. bomb this mass splinter effect may be importantat 23 feet. Such effects, of course, only occur for bombs so lightly fused as toexplode on the surface of the ground.The majority of bombs not striking buildings, and many that do, penetrateten or more feet into the ground before exploding. Such bombs produce a craterinside which practically everything is destroyed and produce as well movements in the ground which crack or destroy buildings, according to their intensity.Splinters are not projected and blast is comparatively ineffective outside the coneof the crater.Ground shock consists of an upward and outward movement followed by a shorter downward and inward one, so that a permanent displacement results.For large bombs the temporary movements near the crater may be as great as  feet and the permanent 18 in., but they fall off very rapidly with distance fromthe bomb, particularly the upward component, and are inappreciable at distancesranging from 30 feet from a 50 kg. bomb to 150 feet from a 1,800 kg. bomb.Maximum movements of about 6 in. seem sufficient to bring down 9-in. brick walls.Ground shock is particularly effective in damaging the upper parts of buildings,such as chimneys and the walls remote from the bomb, by a kind of knock-on effect.It is also the primary cause of destruction of underground buildings.It is now possible to distinguish between what may be called primary and secondary damage to buildings. The immediate effect of a bomb explosion is topulverise and remove bodily all structures close to it. This may be called the primary range of destruction of the bomb. In most cases, however, the partdestroyed by the bomb normally functions as support for a larger section of thebuilding, and the strains produced by its removal, together with additional(although usually slighter) strains produced by blast, bring down a much largersection.If the explosion of the bomb takes place above ground level still furthersecondary destruction may be caused by the collapse of floors and walls beneathdue to debris load. In this way the area of damage produced by a single bombexplosion may be multiplied several times.The extent of secondary damage depends enormously on the size and methodof construction of the building. It is clearly worse in tall buildings than insingle-storeyed ones and for buildings with load-bearing walls of brick or masonrythan with frame structures of reinforced concrete or steel.With 50 kg. bombs the effects depend largely on whether the explosion takes place in the roof or upper storeys, in the middle of the building or in the groundfloor or basement. Many explosions high up produce only local damage, though with poor construction a whole section of a house, limited usually by party walls,may collapse to ground level. In one case a bomb bursting in the 11th storeybrought down everything to the 1st by debris load alone.This type of collapse is even more likely for bombs bursting half-way up,though with well-constructed houses, such as the larger houses of Central orWest London, this may only result in blowing out a two-floor section of an outerwall. Explosions near the base of the building more rarely bring it down unless a corner is undermined. Usually the wall is breached, but upper storeys hold.Party walls dividing tenements or houses usually limit secondary collapse. so often do walls of central passages, which compared with outer walls, contain fewopenings.With 250 kg. or heavier bombs all these effects are much more severe.Domestic houses, tenements and blocks of flats are usually completely demolishedby a direct hit on any part, and often by a near hit in the road. Here the valueof areas in preventing collapse has been well demonstrated. A 500 kg. bombbursting 35 feet away from a brick house merely pushed in the area and left thehouse undamaged.With heavily-constructed brick or masonry buildings, such as public buildings,hospitals, older offices, &amp;c, the effects are more limited but very severe.  Complete
collapse occurs more rarely, but, owing to thicker walls or ceilings, the debrisloads are much greater and the rescue of buried persons a much more difficult task, especially if the debris load is held up on an upper storey.Buildings such as halls, churches, theatres, &amp;c, with load-bearing brick ormasonry walls, fare particularly badly. Once a wall has been removed, say, bycombined mass splinter attack from an internal or external explosion, it usuallyleads to complete collapse.Statistics of Damage to Houses.As a result of the bomb census, we can now state approximately the numberof houses destroyed and damaged by bombs of different types. Figures forBirmingham and London are shown in Table 2. The consistency of these resultsshows that they must approximate to the truth for normal domestic built-up areas.The suburban figures are naturally lower. It can be seen that, though the 50 kg.bomb demolishes fewer houses, weight for weight, than a 250 kg., it seriouslydamages more. This is because many direct hits with 50 kg. bombs do notdemolish a house, but usually result in its having to be pulled down. The net result is that all bombs are, weight for weight, about equally effective indemolition of buildings. In producing repairable damage there is, however, agreat difference between the bomb types. The heavier the bomb the greater the damage per unit weight. This is specially important for damage due to blast,where damage to roofs, &amp;c, makes houses temporarily uninhabitable and presentsa serious problem of dealing with refugees. With 50 kg. bombs there are roughlytwo temporary refugees to one permanently bombed out; heavier bombs than500 kg. or mines over six to one. If the tendency to use progressively heavierbombs or mines is continued, the problem of minor damage and its social effectswill become of major importance.Framed buildings.Most valuable information has been gained on the effects of bombs on framedbuildings. Such buildings are practically immune to anything but a direct hit.Blast damage from bombs outside is usually confined to windows and internalpartitions. Even parachute mines falling immediately outside the building orexploding on the roof produce negligible damage to structure or floors.Bombs on striking framed buildings generally penetrate the roof and one,two or three floors before exploding. 50 kg. bombs usually explode on the topfloor or the one next to it, while heavier bombs penetrate little more deeply (see table 3). One 1,400 kg. bomb penetrated four floors to a basement beforeexploding, but this is exceptional. There is very little resistance in the floors ofsuch buildings to penetration, but in nearly every case the bomb strikes animportant stanchion or girder, which arrests its course. The actual position ofdetonation seems to be fixed partly by this, but mainly by the fusing of the bomb.Unexploded bombs have been found at different levels in buildings, clearlyarrested by the framework, but there seems to be a tendency for explosion of allbombs without direct action fuses to occur about 30 ft. below the point of entry,irrespective of obstacles encountered. Even if the bomb is not arrested on strikinga girder, this often seems to injure it and cause only partial detonation.When the explosion occurs, damage seems to be due very largely to the direct and reflected blast waves from roof and walls. Internal partitions on the flooraffected are completely destroyed, as usually are the ceiling and floor immediatelyover and under the explosion, but, even with 250 kg. bombs, it is very rare for more than three floors to be affected. The destroyed wall panels on the floor inwhich the explosion occurs are nearly always thrown out, and this seems to relieve the explosion and prevent further damage.The effects on the structure are usually slight in steel-framed buildings.Occasionally when a wall panel is too firmly attached to stanchions these are bentand some girders fall. This has happened in one or two cases where bombs haveexploded inside one- or two-storeyed buildings where only relatively weak anglebrackets prevent stanchions splaying out and leading to collapse of floors, aswhen a 1,400 kg. bomb burst in Sloane Square Station booking hall (seeAppendix). This type of failure does not occur in multi-storeyed buildings. a bomb of the same type bursting in the basement of Whiteley&apos;s produced ncstructural damage.   Out of all the cases reported, we have come across no case of
structural collapse of multi-storeyed steel-framed buildings. Only in two cases those of Whiteley&apos;s and Broadway House have floors more than four from the roof been affected by bombs striking roof or sides.In reinforced concrete buildings structural damage has been more serious,though in a number of cases, particularly in flats and office buildings, the damage has been very similar to that in steel-framed buildings. In factories and ware-houses with a pillar type of construction there is a tendency to shear off thestanchions of the outer walls. If this occurs over one side of the building, theremay be a general collapse of that face, which may strike inwards and may involvea considerable part of the building. Such a collapse occurred in the B.S.A.factory at Birmingham, where sixty people were killed in a building supposed tobe safe.The basements of framed buildings have one weak spot they often projectunder the street. A number of direct hits have been scored on such basements,resulting in considerable internal damage due to blast, and also in casualties wherethe basements have been used as shelter. This could be largely prevented bysufficiently strengthening outer walls or by putting shelters at some distance from them.Industrial Buildings.There is now a very considerable volume of evidence on the type of damageproduced in factories of different types. In comparison with the number of bombs dropped or the number actually striking buildings, this has been much smaller than had been anticipated. Except for roof coverings the majority of modernfactories would seem to be built so as to minimise bomb damage. This is true notonly for the small bombs originally used in attacks on factories, but also for thelarger bombs and mines. The main reason for this limited damage is the presenceof a load bearing steel frame. It is extremely difficult to destroy even a singleimportant member of such a frame by means of a bomb. This could only be doneby explosion in actual contact with the member, which is bound to be a very rareoccurrence. A near miss simply scars the steel with splinters and perhapsdisplaces it by a few inches. The most serious effect is a bomb bursting in the floor which may displace the base of a stanchion. Here the damage may be widespread. It can be largely prevented by reconstructing or adapting thebuilding in accordance with the principle of continuity as recommended inBulletin C. 15 of the Research and Experiments Department.The importance of guarding against the secondary effects of the resultingcollapse cannot be over emphasised. In one case, an aircraft erection shed was hit by four 250 kg. bombs. Only one of these bombs played an important partin the resulting collapse. The shed was 1,000 ft. long by 400 ft. wide, and the cutting of one stanchion by the bomb resulted in the complete collapse of the fulllength of the shed for a width of 200 ft. There is little doubt that this collapsecould have been confined to that portion of the roof carried by the damagedstanchion, if a small amount of additional &quot; collapse &quot; bracing had been provided in the roof. On the advice of this Department, such bracing is now being addedto the surviving portions of the factory and is also being incorporated in the newsteelwork which is to replace the demolished portion.Fortunately, however, collapses such as that described above are relativelyuncommon, and only certain types of roofs are subject to them. New factories,provided that they are designed in accordance with the recommendations made in research and Experiments Department Bulletin No. C. 12, should be immune, anddesigners now appear to be making fuller use of these recommendations. Thereare, however, many existing factories which are vulnerable and will suffer fromserious collapse if hit. This can be prevented if the few structural precautionsoutlined in Research and Experiments Department Bulletin No. C. 15 are taken.Concrete buildings have not proved quite as satisfactory as steel. It is almost as difficult to destroy a reinforced concrete as a steel member, but here,unfortunately, although the member may still stand, a bent and distorted concretestructure where the bond between concrete and steel has been broken cannot easily be repaired and remains a source of danger. Furthermore, owing to the characterof concrete construction this type of distortion extends very much further fromthe explosion, so that the area to be repaired is much greater.  Immediate collapse,
however, with the danger that it entails to machinery and personnel, is little more to be feared.With brick or masonry structures, however, and particularly with structureswhere the supports for floors and roofs consist of load bearing walls, the situationis very different. Such walls can readily be completely destroyed in considerablelengths by direct hits or near misses, entailing the complete collapse of the floorsor roof they support and generally the rebuilding of the whole structure. It isparticularly unfortunate that owing to the shortage of steel there is a tendency to revert to this type of structure and it seems almost suicidal to attempt it for new vital factories. Where steel and brick are used it would seem better to keepthe two structurally separate. Where a brick wall is bonded to steel uprightsthe result of an explosion is not to overturn the wall as it would if it were free,but to distort it permanently, resulting in bending of the stanchions and some-times a shearing off of roof members and the need for almost complete rebuilding.Where the steel frame has not collapsed, or been much distorted, repairs can beeffected very quickly. In one case, for instance, in which a factory receivedtwelve direct hits by 50 kg. bombs, full production was resumed in 7 days.In shed type factories, the chief damage has been by blast to the roofs. Heremuch has depended on the type of roofing materials. Unprotected glass isdestroyed in very large areas, so is asbestos sheeting. The best material wouldseem to be steel sheeting. Too strong a roof covering has the unfortunate effectof distorting roof members before yielding. With a brittle material the greatestdamage has been caused by pieces of roof falling on machinery or personnel. Thishas been particularly bad in hangars and aircraft works where many planes havebeen seriously damaged by an easily preventable cause. Scrim, stuck to glass witha bitumenous paint and wire netting below, still seems an ideal solution. Detailedaccounts of typical damage to shed type factory buildings and to roof coveringare given in Bulletins C. 1, C. 2 and C. 8.Internal damage to factories depends very much on whether they are of theshed or multi-storey type. In the first case the bomb may burst either on a roofmember or on the ground. Bombs bursting on the roof are unexpectedlynumerous, probably at least half of those striking such buildings. In this casethe chief damage is done by splinters travelling downwards; but, owing to thelight nature of the bombs used so far, these have caused very &quot;little damage tomachinery, although they have been responsible for the greater number of the casulties. Bombs bursting in the ground are apt to displace and wreckmachinery, but on a smaller scale than was anticipated, and do much more damage to services electricity, water, &amp;c. In one case at least five 50 kg. bombs explodedin shops, &amp;c, without doing damage to any machine, and in another only one machine out of eighteen was damaged, but could be repaired. This applies particularly to modern factories where each machine with its motor is a self-contained unit. In older factories damage to shafting, &amp;c, is much more extensiveand serious. With the heavier bombs now being used, especially in London,splinter damage to machinery is becoming far more severe. Multi-storeyedfactories behave structurally as already described, but additional risks exist owingto the presence of machinery on upper floors.Vital Points.In a number of cases factories have been put out of action by destruction ofsome vital point, either special machines or tools or part of an internal service,such as a switchboard or a pump. These points are relatively easy to protectagainst anything but direct hits of heavier bombs, but this has not yet been donein nearly enough cases.  The effects of direct hits can be remedied by duplication.Electrical Supply.Electricity undertakings have suffered less than might have been expected from raid damage though this was by no means negligible. London had at onetime over a quarter million kilowatts out of action. The effect on supply wasminimised by the interconnection of generating stations and the formation of anational pool of equipment facilitating rapid replacement.Much of the damage, however, was due to the failure to apply widely enoughthe protective measures set out in A.R.P. Memorandum No. C.2. Furtherprotective measures have since been devised as a result of the experience gainedin raids.
The chief danger to electricity undertakings from H.E. attack is due tosplinters. Owing to the size and solidity of the buildings, blast and earth shockhave little effect. It is practicable to give splinter protection to most vital partsexcept the boilers. Transformers and turbo-generators have suffered severelyfrom the lack of such protection. The damage to switch-gear can be localisedby division walls strong enough to withstand blast and splinters. Fire damage,often secondary to H.E. attack, is made worse by the oil released from holedtransformer casings and emphasises particularly the need for their protection.Supply lines have occasionally suffered from damage by splinters, and shortsfrom barrage balloon wires have been a serious nuisance, having in one month(November) occasioned nearly as much loss of supply as did the raids. The numberof instances of serious damage to towers and poles is very small.Gasworks.A number of gasworks have been affected both by H.E. and incendiary attacks.The damage from H.E. has usually been surprisingly small and rapidly repairable,except when bombs burst among piping, causing extensive holing and secondaryfires. Protection against this seems almost impossible, but the delay in restartingcould be much reduced by duplication of lines and bye-passing.Services.It is estimated that the major cause of production losses in raids is due tocutting of services. About one bomb in eighteen dropped on an urban districtsevers water, gas or electricity mains. While this cannot be prevented on a large scale, protection could be provided for important factories by placing services inducts, and ill-effects could be minimised by provision of alternative supplies,ring mains and other devices.Fire.Even in the earlier raids on London, fires were at least as destructive ofproperty as high explosive. It was estimated that, before the present methods of active attack on incendiary bombs became effective, one ton of incendiary bombswould start about 80 fires in an average London area. Although in the Coventryraid incendiary bombs were a small proportion of the total bomb load, they didmost of the damage, particularly irreparable damage. The enemy appears tohave observed this, because in his &quot;blitz&quot; attack on Southampton more than half the total bomb load was incendiary. Since then all &quot; blitz &quot; attacks revealthat the enemy regards fire as the principal destroying agent. Recent attacksshow evidence of careful tactical study with the aim of assisting the spread of fire or hindering fire fighting, the predominant aim being to create anuncontrollable large-scale conflagration. In the period covered by thisAppreciation incendiary tactics were in their early stages and have since been considerably developed.The incendiary attacks here considered revealed that the tentative fire-watching arrangements then in practice were quite inadequate. Many buildings and large stocks of goods were destroyed by fire caused by single incendiary bombs that could have been easily quenched in the first five minutes. Even wherebuildings were well watched and equipped with fire parties, they werefrequently overwhelmed by fire spreading from adjacent undefended buildings.A feature of intensive attack was the disastrous effect of high-explosivebombing on the water supplies and, even where the mains were not damaged, theyoften proved insufficient to deal with a conflagration. The first symptom ofinadequacy of water supply is loss of pressure at hydrants, so that hose jets fail to reach roof fires. This means that all water must be pumped by appliances.A second stage is reached when the supply for pumps becomes insufficient andresort must be had to static water, or long-distance pumping from canals, riversor docks. A most serious situation develops when water supplies are dislocatedand measures for bringing up water are held up by road damage, preventing themovement of fire appliances. This stage was quickly reached at Coventry and southampton. The need for abundant supplies of static water was realised bythe Fire Brigades Division from the beginning, but such provision is stillinadequate in many large towns.[22455] c
The nature of the town plan is a major factor in the extent of damage dueto incendiary attack. A pronounced feature of &quot;blitz&quot; attacks has beendestruction by fire of commercial, shopping and warehouse areas. This does notappear to be due necessarily to concentration of attack on those areas, but totheir inherent vulnerability to this form of attack. There is some evidence thatall attacks began with a random scattering of incendiary bombs over the wholebuilt-up area. But because the commercial and shopping area is almost invariablvthe most congested part of the town, contains large stocks of combustible goods and (at the time) w^as quite inadequately watched, large fires occurred there.Later attackers, attracted by the fire, may have contributed to its spread bvdropping more incendiary bombs on adjacent unburnt areas.Examination of fire damage has revealed that hardly one-tenth per cent, of buildings in commercial and shopping areas have any pretence to fire-resistingconstruction, timber roofs and floors being almost universal. Newer buildings of fire-resisting construction, or having roofs impenetrable to the kilo incendiarybomb, have sometimes survived in the middle of gutted areas, though in some cases they have been overwhelmed by fire spreading through the windows from adjacentpremises. The need for structural protection, i.e., the provision of impenetrableroofs or of roof treatments to resist fire effect, cannot be too strongly emphasised.A sufficiently strong attack can overwhelm the most efficient fire brigade and fire-watching service, but an area in which all roofs were protected would be almostimmune from fires, even under very heavy attack.At Coventry the numerous war production factories suffered less from firethan from high explosive. This was partly due to their possessing reasonablyefficient works fire brigades and partly to their almost universal single storeyconstruction and light roofs resulting in almost all bombs penetrating to workshopfloors, where they could be easily attacked. Numerous cases of fires, however,occurred in the stores buildings of factories. These were almost invariably ofnon-fire-resisting multi-storey construction, thus forming, with their contents,first-class incendiary targets. Many of these buildings contained a certainamount of steeelwork not protected against fire; the fire effect on this notinfrequently caused it, when collapsing, to drag down the wralls so that the wholebuilding was reduced to a heap of ruins.Where fires gutted machine shops, it was observed that machine tools oftensuffered no more than superficial damage. In many such cases almost all the machine tools were salvaged, except that the independent-drive electric motorsin them were destroyed. Where machinery is not on ground level it is frequentlyirreparably damaged by the collapse of floors brought about by the fire. AtCoventry it was observed that work, vitally important to the national war effort,and costly and sometimes irreplaceable machinery were not infrequently housedin shoddy and highly combustible buildings. Often no effort had been made toreduce the fire risk or to give the machinery protection.Bridges.A large number of direct hits have been scored on bridges and tunnels. as would be expected, a normal railway five- or seven-ring brick arch has not provedparticularly bomb-proof. Lightly-fused bombs have gone off on the crown of thearch, usually displacing a certain amount of the structure and filling the spaceunderneath with debris. 250-kg. and some 50-kg. bombs have penetrated thearch and exploded underneath, doing more extensive damage. In either case,however, the damage is usually localised to the particular side of the arch attacked.In only one or two cases has a complete railway arch been destroyed over itswhole width.It has been found possible to effect repairs in most cases with very littleloss of time, but these events are more serious where the space under the archhas been used as a shelter than for the actual interference with transport. Inthe first kind of case a number of deaths must be caused through falling debris,but these are usually restricted to the area immediately underneath the bomb.Internal explosions, however, have been very much more serious, partly due to theabsence of effective internal partitions. In one case a 50-kg. bomb penetrated a railway arch used as a shelter, killed 105 and seriously injured 58--nearlyeveryone, in fact, taking shelter (see Appendix).
The effect on steel girder bridges has been much less. Many direct hits havebeen scored on such girders, but in very few cases has anything but superficialdamage been done, and no complete bridge has failed.Tunnels.A sufficient number of railway and tube tunnels have now been damaged tobe able to get an ordered picture of the degree of safety provided by differentdepths of cover. Where the cover is less than 10 ft., the effects are indistinguish-able from those of the railway arches already discussed. Explosions have takenplace inside such tunnels and produced serious effects due to blast at considerabledistances, without, up to date, however, accounting for any major disaster,although a number of people were killed by secondary blast on the Tube platformat Bank Underground Station by blast travelling down the escalator. In thick-nesses up to 30 ft., explosions taking place in the earth or on the crown of thearch have blown the roof of the tunnel in and given rise to an enlarged open craterin which further collapse often occurs into the tunnel. This results in completeblockage and considerable difficulty in repair. At greater depths, up to 40 ft.?two kinds of damage occur. Heavy bombs exploding near the surface and form-ing open craters may also produce the collapse of the roof of the arch of thetunnel beneath and a limited amount of earth usually drops. This was the typeof damage causing the disasters at Bounds Green and Balham Tube Stations,where about 35 and 100 people were buried in the debris, 25 and 65 respectivelybeing fatalities. Collapse in all such cases seems to be limited to about 20 ft.of tunnel nearest the bomb. If the bomb penetrates more deeply before exploding,as in the case of Penge Tunnel, it blows out only into the tunnel, forming nocrater, though subsidence may occur later. In even deeper tunnels, such as thatat Trafalgar Square, pieces of lining are displaced by earth shock but little earthfollows, and the damage is relatively easy to repair. A complication that hasoccurred in a small number of cases has been the breaking of water mains near the surface, leading to the flooding of the tunnel and to carrying large quantities ofearth from upper levels (e.g., Euston Underground). This is serious from theengineering point of view as it multiplies difficulties in repairing, but there isnot much danger to life as the rate of flooding is so slow that there is little risk ofdrowning. The protection given by tunnels is limited by the size of bombs dropped. The cases mentioned above have all been due to heavy bombs from 500to 1,400 kg. Deeper tunnels might be affected by 1,800 kg. or larger bombs, but itdoes not seem probable that such bombs are likely to make direct hits with sufficientpenetration to do much more serious damage.A certain amount of damage has been done to culverts, dams and embankmentsby bombs. One of these in the New River endangered much of London&apos;s watersupply but was rapidly repaired. Another at Teddington Weir was aggravated by a tidal scour. On the whole, however, bombs on massive structures, embank-ments, &amp;c, have had very little effect.Shelters.The raids on London provide us with very complete evidence on the effectof bombs on all different types of shelter. Shelters played a much larger part inprotection in London than they had in earlier raids in different parts of thecountry, because, owing to raids occurring at night, warning was effectivelyadequate, and all those wishing to take shelter probably did so. Anotherdifference is that London is provided with far greater number of large sheltersthan provincial cities, and, as the bombing was heavy in the regions where theseshelters existed, a number of direct or near hits were scored on them. Only inthe outer districts were shelters of the personal types, particularly Andersonshelters, heavily involved.A nderson Shelters.Far more people take shelter in Anderson shelters than in any other type,except, however, in Central London where bombing was heaviest. We have nowfairly full information on the behaviour of these shelters.The protective value of the Anderson shelter against bombs is now seen tobe due to three factors : in the first place their small size, in the second, as provid-ing a good base for a partially underground earth-covered trench, and in the[22455] c 2
third place the fact that they are usually placed in gardens, where the soft earthtends to assist the penetration of the bomb and the consequent absence of splinters.Hits within about 6 ft. by 50 kg. bombs usually, but not always, completely destroy the shelter and kill all&apos; its occupants, although lucky escapes at even smallei&apos;distances have occurred. At any greater distance, however, the properly con-structed shelter, provided with a baffle wall, is usually not damaged, nor do itsoccupants suffer more than a shock. Most casualties in Anderson shelters, otherthan those caused by direct hits, have been due to splinters penetrating unprotectedfront and back. A number of cases of casualties and deaths from bombs burstingas far away as 18 ft. have been recorded. This emphasises the necessity of puttingbaffle walls close in front of shelters, even when these are only 15 ft. or less fromthe wall of a house. The behaviour of Anderson shelters with the 250 kg. bombis similar. Once outside the crater, i.e., about 20 ft. away from the bomb, butsometimes as little as 15 ft., those in the shelter are usually safe. There is, how-ever a possible source of weakness in the back walls, which tend to get pushedin and cause casualties. For bombs bursting near the surface far more damage has occurred. Cases are known of properly covered Anderson shelters being holedby splinters from a 250 kg. bomb as far away as 70 ft.Brick Surface Shelters.The protection offered by brick surface shelters is of a lower order. This isdue essentially to the inherent weakness of unreinforced. brick work to earthshock and mass splinter attack, and failure accordingly occurs at approximately the same distances from bombs as are shown in Table 1, that is, well outside thecrater for 250 kg. and larger bombs. Unfortunately, quite a number of theseshelters are not well built. Many of the shelters, chiefly communal, in Londonwere made with sand lime mortar. These, owing to lack of tensile strength,have been unable to resist earth shock, wave and blast. Shelters have been prac-tically disintegrated and have fallen apart, brick by brick. Where reinforcedconcrete roofs have been used these have even fallen down and crushed theoccupants. With other roof types, corbelled or brick arched roofs, collapse is alsovery frequent, but as these break up into smaller pieces, the injury to occupantsis less. Cases have been recorded of brick surface shelters being destroyed atdistances between 7 and 40 ft. from 50 kg. bombs, averaging (over these cases)20 ft., and at distances of between 13 ft. and 45 ft. from 250 kg. bombs, averaging32 ft. One shelter was destroyed 100 ft. from a 1,000 kg. bomb, but another of thesame type remained standing at 75 ft. The wide range is due to the differences in construction and the differences in the positions of the bombs and the nature ofthe explosion; the broadside on position being much more dangerous than the endon and explosions deep in soft soil having the least effect.Blast, which can usually be neglected in small shelters, has had disastrouseffects on some lime mortar brick shelters. Out of 23 cells within 200 ft. of a mine,7 were totally demolished, 7 partially so and only 9, though damaged, wererepairable. Failure had occurred owing to the splaying out of the walls bysuction and the falling in of the roof. A shelter broadside-on was demolished at195 ft., whereas another end-on was only partially destroyed at 35 ft. Housesbetween the shelters and the mines were still standing.The shelter occupancy census taken at the beginning of November showed,on the average, 27 per cent, of public surface shelter space and 30 per cent, of domestic brick shelters were occupied, but percentages as low as 3 were shown by some of the most heavily bombed boroughs.Out of thirty cases of desti-oyed brick surface shelters of which we havedetailed information, twenty-two were unoccupied.Reinforced concrete surface shelters, of which there are very few in existence,have behaved quite differently; some have even stood up 2 ft. from a 50 kg. bomb,and 11 ft. from a 250 kg. bomb, and have only shown bending of the walls wherebrick would have been completely demolished.Trench Shelters.Trench shelters have also for the most part behaved badly; the worst arethose with wooden linings. Very few, however, are still in occupation. Herelinings have cracked as far away as 75 ft. from a 250 kg. bomb.   Those with
precast units, which are extremely common, have also behaved badly. Failurehere has been due to two causes. Bombs dropped outside such structures causebreaking or collapse of the side panels, leading to falling of the roof and completecollapse over long lengths of trench. The other failure is due to blast in the trench caused by a direct hit at some distant part of the trench system. In theKennington trench shelters, for example, a 3()0-ft. length of trench was destroyed in this way by one bomb. Casualties have been very heavy where such sheltershave been occupied, but a number of cases of destruction of empty shelters have occurred. Trenches lined with in-situ reinforced concrete or with steel liningshave behaved very much better, near misses causing only local bulges and cracking,and direct hits damaging only the part immediately affected, and nowhere causingextensive collapse.Basement shelters.The most serious disasters in the London raids have been those in basementshelters, which usually offer accommodation for the largest number of people, are most popular, and are found in the most crowded districts. Experience has shownthat the conditions for which these shelters were designed are not those to whichthey have actually been exposed. In very few cases has a bomb burst in a houseabove such a shelter and destroyed the house in such a way that the debris loadhas fallen vertically on the strutting. In these cases the strutted floor has usuallyheld the debris, though there have been some cases of failure due to direct debrisloads and also to shock transmitted through walls above the basement. Far more frequently, however, a bomb has burst at the side of the basement, either in theroad outside or in a neighbouring basement. This exposes the strutted shelterto a sideways strain which it was not designed to take. Where the extra supportis given by girders attached to existing or new brick walls, these have collapsed,bringing down the whole basement and burying the occupants. Where struttinghas been used without cross-bracing, the struts have tilted over and led to moreor less extensive collapse. Particularly bad has been the behaviour of brick pillarsas struts. A discussion of some of the worst cases of failure of basementsis contained in the Appendix. Only in very few recorded cases have any struttedbasements resisted these conditions, and that has usually been because struttinghas been by means of framed structural steel or well crossed-braced wood. Failureof a basement produces a far larger proportion of fatalities to other casualtiesthan any other types of shelter owing to the ease with which exits can be blockedand to the consequent trapping of occupants who may be subsequently drownedor asphyxiated.   (See section on Casualties.)Disasters.In the course of the raids on London there have been some notable disastersin which a large number of people have lost their lives at one time. The greatmajority of these have occurred in shelters at night, though there have been oneor two cases of mass casualties in factories during day raids, particularly duringclocking on or off. Other disasters have occurred in hospitals and rest centreswhere large numbers of persons have been exposed in old buildings where a bombhas produced general collapse.An analysis of some forty important disasters is given in the Appendix.It can be seen from the tables that the disasters so far reported have accountedfor a considerable proportion, roughly one fifth, of the deaths in MetropolitanBoroughs, or 22 per cent, in all Boroughs for which they occur. This large deathroll is shown to be due almost entirely to two causes, the poor quality of manylarge places used as shelters, and the continued use of large unframed buildingsas rest centres and hospitals. Deaths recorded in disasters in these two categoriesaccount for at least 1,221 out of the 1,673 recorded. The worst failure is that ofstrutted basements in non-framed buildings, mostly due to collapse due to near misses. Trenches come next all the worst cases are due to the use of precastunits. Arches and subways are almost as bad, but the death roll here is highbecause, unlike trenches, these are a very popular type of shelter. The figures given here only represent a small selection of outstanding events, so that many more deaths must have occurred in Central London due to the failure of one or,other of these types of shelter.
Casualties.We are now in a far better position to estimate the effects of air raids in producing casualties. Three lines of investigation can be combined to give ageneral and detailed picture of how casualties are related to bombing and toavailable shelter. The recently instituted Bomb Census gives us for London thenumber of bombs for many boroughs from the beginning of the serious raids.Further detail giving bomb sizes is available in November for Central London.At the same time, casualty figures for many of these same boroughs have been collected by Dr. Bradford Hill from their medical officers of health. These figuresonly give the number of dead and wounded. Some indication of the cause of thewounds and of the place in which the casualty occurs has, however, beenfurnished by certain medical officers and analysed by Dr. Bradford Hill for about,000 casualties, including 1,500 dead, in the London region. Further detailsgiving very complete medical histories and full accounts of the circumstances ofthe incident have been collected by Professor Zuckerman and his field workers,mostly in Birmingham and London, for some fifty incidents involving casualties.To complete the picture given by these surveys, it is necessary to know what thepopulation is and how it is distributed during the actual raids, between houses and different types of shelter. We have here some evidence from the shelteroccupancy census of the London region. This is now being supplemented by asampling survey to determine this exposure to risk. It is in hand under thetemporary direction of Dr. Yates in London, but no results are yet available.Detailed analysis.Air raid casualties can be classified into primary-due to the direct actionof the bomb itself, explosive gases, blast and splinters; secondary where injuryis caused by the victim being knocked over or thrown about by blast or splinters;tertiary due to falling debris or collapsed buildings; and quaternary due to more remote results of explosion, such as drowning, asphyxiation by coal gas. orburns.Primary effects, except for splinters from bombs exploding in the open, are much more confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the bomb than has often been believed. True blast casualties with injuries to the lungs have been found,but nearly always in cases that have been in the actual room where the bombexploded. Mines, however, with their large blast effect, have caused pure blastcasualties in the open. Splinter wounds mostly occur in the open or in rooms,halls or shelters in which bombs actually explode. Walls, even partition walls,seem to stop most of the splinters and much of the blast even when they are them-selves completely disintegrated by the explosion.Secondary injuries occur mostly either in the open or Anderson shelters.Several cases have been investigated in which persons in such shelters have been blown over or on to houses, in some cases with only slight injuries.Tertiary effects cause far the greatest number of casualties, though thefatality rate is naturally not so high as for primary effects. The most importanttertiary effect is burying under debris, often complicated by falls due to collapse of floors. In a number of the cases investigated death was certainly notinstantaneous, and mechanical injury was slight. Asphyxiation, due to pressure on the chest or blocking of mouth and nose by fine dust, was the ultimate cause of death. This was particularly so in casualties in collapsed small houses not very close to the explosion. This appears to point to the need for enlarging rescueparties and speeding up their work.Quaternary effects are mainly confined to persons trapped in large shelterswith broken water and gas pipes, and emphasises the point made elsewhere onthe need of structural improvement in these shelters, and particularly of theirexits. Carbon monoxide poisoning may be more common than is recognised, aconsiderable proportion of the small number of autopsies that have been carriedout showing this condition.The character of the place occupied by the victims determines largely the typeof casualty.   They fall into two main groups : A. Casualties in the open or in large halls or shelters which do not collapse;mainly of the primary or secondary type.B. Casualties in buildings or shelters which do collapse; mainly of thetertiary or quaternary type.
The first group includes particularly factory casualties in daylight raids,and casualties in cinemas, rest centres and large basement or railway archshelters, struck and penetrated by small bombs. The Druid Street shelter (seeAppendix) is a typical example. If the area is closely packed, casualties areheavy; there are a large number of deaths from blast and splinters, but those notin the immediate neighbourhood of the explosion usually escape unhurt. Wherepeople are scattered in open ground, splinter casualties, though distributed overa large area, are much slighter.Group B contains the great majority of casualties.   It includes 1. The cases, very common in casualties in Anderson and trench shelters.just outside bomb craters, where occupants are concussed by thecrushing in of a wall.2. The collapse of basement shelters and trenches from near-misses of largebombs, of which examples have been given.3. Most casualties in domestic houses except for those directly in the roomwhere the bomb explodes.4. The crushing of occupants of surface shelters by the failure of the wallsand the fall of the roof.5. The burying of persons under the earth from spalling of the roof of tunnelor Tube shelters (see the case of Bounds Green).Statistical Analysis.A more extensive series of medical returns give a general picture of the numerical importance of the different types enumerated above. Nine categoriesare used for the cause of injury : (1) Direct effect of bomb.(2) Blast.(3) Debris.(4) Splinters ((a) bomb and (b) anti-aircraft).(5) Cuts by glass.(6) Shock or nervous prostration.(7) Fire.(8) Other specified causes.(9) Unknown.The numbers of wounded and killed are shown in Table 4. Unfortunately itis difficult for people without special training and working often under verydifficult conditions to determine the precise cause of injury in many cases, andthe classification is therefore inevitably uncertain.The first two categories are difficult to distinguish. The recorded prevalence of blast injuries in Anderson shelters, where primary lung blast injury must bevery rare, shows that this is used to describe secondary effects such as that of people being blown about. Casualties attributed to debris must also containprimary and secondary injuries. It can, however, be seen that in small shelterssuch as Andersons direct effects and blast are the chief cause of injury. Indwelling houses, direct effects and debris account almost equally for the deaths,but debris accounts for more of the non-fatal casualties than any other singlecause. Only in the open and, as some detailed studies have shown, in factories are splinters important: of casualties as a whole, they are recorded for only7 per cent.. Large basements are not adequately represented in the series, butwe know that crushing or secondary blast and splinter injuries are the prevailingmodes according as the bomb explodes outside or inside the shelter. An analysis of the anatomical distribution of injuries among 9,000 casualties reported by thepolice gave a little more information, but emphasised the prevalence of wounds ofthe head and upper parts of the body. From other information this must mainlyrefer to injuries in buildings. In the open there is a rather larger proportionof injuries to the lower part of the body.The relative number of casualties inside different types of building or sheltershow a fairly constant proportion of half in dwellings, one-fifth in the street oropen and one-quarter in shelters. The proportion in shelters for the later returnsshows a progressive decrease of shelter casualties corresponding to thesmaller shelter occupancy shown in the census figures. The mean fatalityrate probably lies between 20 per cent, and 24 per cent, while that in shelters, isabout 30 per cent., in houses 20 per cent., and in streets 20 per cent, or possibly
a little less. These figures are very rough, but the differences are significant andfit in with the results of the detailed sample analyses. As a result of the higherfatality rate in shelters, the deaths are distributed roughly two-fifths in dwellings,less than one-tenth in the open and one-third in shelters. There are, however,considerable local variations. In Leyton, for instance, 40 per cent, of the casulties occurred in shelters, while in Hornsey only 10 per cent, did so, corre-sponding to different shelter habits.In the central boroughs we know from the disaster data that the deaths in large shelters alone vary from 87 per cent, to 0 per cent, of total deaths, averaging18 per cent, (see Appendix). Total figures for shelters must necessarily be higheras these figures leave out cases (&quot; non-disasters &quot;) where less than twenty were killed. Even for the outer boroughs, from which most of the cards come andin which few disasters occur, the variation persists.Relation of Casualties to Bombs Dropped.From a knowledge of the number of bombs dropped and the casualtiesoccurring in different boroughs, some idea can be gained of the effectiveness of bombs in producing casualties. The number of casualties per bomb varies widelyfrom 1 - 59 in the least to 6-94 in the most populated boroughs, but it followsclosely the apparent densities of population as shown in figure 1. The number of casulties per bomb is roughly a twelfth of the number of persons per acre, andthe number of deaths per bomb about l/60th of the number of persons per acre.From this it can be deduced that the mean distance at which injury from a bombis likely to occur is 35 ft., and that at which the bomb is lethal is 15 ft.The casualties per bomb in Central London fell steadily from an average of3-7 in September to 2-7 in October and 1-7 in November. This corresponds tothe considerable fall in population in most of the boroughs concerned.Conclusion.We may now say that we have a good general understanding, bpth qualitativeand quantitative, of the effects of bombs on buildings and on cities. New types of bombs, particularly heavier bombs, may be used, but we can anticipate no startlingchange in the effects apart from increase in minor damage. With bombing of thepresent type the results of our work are to show that in urban areas, such as thatof the County of London, for one ton of bombs approximately 10 houses will be destroyed or will need pulling down. 25 more will be temporarily uninhabitable,and another 80 will be slightly damaged. 80 people will be made temporarilyhomeless and 35 will lose their homes permanently. 25 people, mostly among thelatter category, will be wounded, the greater part of them slightly, and 6 will bekilled or die from wounds.In suburban areas these figures will fall off with decrease of the density of population.The effects of fire are impossible to forecast as they depend so largely on the fire-watching and fire-fighting services, but they are never again likely to be as great, for the same weight of bombs, as they were in the autumn and winter raids.If the lessons of these raids are learnt in structural precaution, improvedshelters and organisation, the effects of air raids, though always serious, arelikely to diminish progressively.

APPENDIX.Disasters.A tabulated list of those incidents in which more than 20 people have been killed is given in Tables I and II. It is admittedly incomplete as a number of incidents of this type are continually coming to light which have never been recorded in London Region or reported on by our Observers. It must, however,give a fairly correct picture of the type of occurrence in which large casulties are found. It will be seen that the greatest number of these and also thoseproducing the largest number of casualties are strutted basements, followed byarches and subways or trenches. The surface shelters are not so important, butthis is largely, if not entirely, because they are so rarely occupied. A more detaileddescription of 8 such disasters follows. They are chosen as illustrating the various types of failure of large shelters or buildings containing large numbers of people.As discussed in the section on casualties they fall into two main types, those inwhich the bomb explodes inside the space occupied by people without collapse andthose in which collapse occurs. In one or two cases, such as Kennington Parktrenches and Sloane Square Station, both explosion and collapse occurred, but here the collapse was the more important factor in causing casualties.(1) Morley College.A 1,000 kg. bomb struck the older part of the College, which was of solidbrick wall construction with concrete floors. It penetrated to the ground floorwhere it exploded in a recreation room, which was occupied at the time by 195bombed out refugees. There were 57 deaths and 54 serious casualties. 84 peopleescaped with only light injuries. A large part of the building collapsed, althoughthe basement, which was unstrutted, was undamaged and a few people shelteringin it were not hurt. The adjoining part of the building, which was steel framed,was not affected by the explosion. In this case there was no effective shelter andthe casualties must be put down to the failure, or inability, of the occupantsto take effective shelter. This disaster is one, and by no means the worst, of thoseoccurring in large brick walled buildings used as rest centres.(2) Columbia Market.This was a very large strutted basement under the market. A 50 kg. bombpenetrated the roof of the market and fell down one of the light wells, passing through the sandbag protection. .It exploded at the bottom of the well, whichwas separated from the main shelter only by corrugated iron. Thirty-eightpersons were killed, 38 seriously injured, 86 slightly injured, out of 1,000 peopleoccupying the shelter. All the injuries were either from splinters or from thefabric surrounding the light well thrown about by the explosion. There was no general collapse. This incident shows the danger of large unpartitioned basementshelters, even against light bombs. The fact that the bomb came through the lightwell is not significant; if it had struck any other part of the shelter it would havepenetrated as easily and the casualties would have been as large.There are many such shelters in use, and only chance has prevented a larger number of disasters of this type.Druid Street Arches.This shelter was under a series of railway arches 5 ft. thick and coveredwith rubble. A bomb, probably 50 kg., penetrated the arch and exploded nearone of the side arches connecting neighbouring main arches. There was nocollapse.^ The shelter was occupied by about 200 persons, 105 of these were killed and&apos;5 seriously injured. Nearly all the injuries were due to the flying of splintersor the direct effect of the explosive gases and blast, which threw people againstthe walls, so that there was a large proportion of head injuries.[22455] . E
This incident in itself shows the danger of using railway arches as shelters.Casualties would certainly have been fewer if there had been partitioned compart-rnents containing no more than 50 people each, but even then they would have beenvery serious. No railway arches give much more protection than afforded by this one.(4) Kennington Park Trench Shelter.This is a typical trench shelter with precast reinforced concrete side and roofunits, built in rectangles connected by passages leading to the entrances. A250 kg. bomb struck one of the,shorter sides of such a rectangle and explodedinside it. About a 300-ft. run of the shelter was completely destroyed, nearly allthe rectangle in which the bomb dropped and a large part of the next one.. near the bomb the roof of the shelter was blown off, and the sides, which are held apartonly by it, collapsed.  Further away earth shock pushed in the sides of the shelter.At least 47 people were killed and 20 seriously injured. Casualties wouldhave been far worse had the shelter been fully occupied. The section completely destroyed should have accommodated about 200 persons. This incident, whichis only one of many of the same type, shows the fundamental weakness of precastconcrete-lined trenches. Their whole strength resides in the mutual support ofwalls and roof, and if this is disturbed complete collapse results. In situ castconcrete trenches have behaved very much better; there are numerous cases of direct hits, and here casualties are limited to the immediate neighbourhood ofthe bomb.(5) Stoke Newington Road.This was a large basement shelter underneath a 5-storey substantially builtbrick tenement with concrete floors. The shelter was divided into three compart-ments, and each was protected by new rolled steel joists supported partly on new and partly on old brick walls. A large bomb. 500 or 1,000 kg., struck part of thetenement on one side of the shelter, penetrated to the ground floor and exploded.The tenement was completely wrecked over a frontage of 100 ft. The explosionstove in the wall of the nearest compartment of the shelter, causing completecollapse of the rolled steel joists resting on it, and, at the same time, so unsettledthe next party wall that it also collapsed over the larger part, of the area. Thethird section was unaffected. Each compartment of the shelter was occupied by approximately 100 persons. In the first compartment not a single person escaped,although it was seen from the position in which the bodies were found, mainlyaround the two exit doors, that they were attempting to do so and were not. killedas a direct effect of the explosion; in the second compartment about 30 peopleescaped. One hundred and fifty-seven bodies were recovered after three weeks ofdigging. This disaster, the most serious which has occurred in the raids on london, shows the fundamental weakness of supporting roofs of basement sheltersion brick walls. Had the supports been steel it is doubtful whether there wouldhave been any casualties except those of persons leaning up against the wallnearest to the explosion.(6) Whitelefs Store.(Technically, as only 17 people were killed in this incident, it is not reckoned as a disaster in the statistical table. The account of it is given here for its technical interest, showing the contrast in the behaviour of framed and unframedbuildings.)A 1,000 kg. bomb struck the roof of Whiteley&apos;s Store, penetrated to theground floor and exploded in the roof of the basement. Part of this basement,about 15 ft. from where the bomb exploded, was used as a shelter and wasseparated from the rest by 13-g-in. brick walls.The explosion wrecked a considerable part of the basement and ground floor,but the main structure was not affected and there was no collapse. Seventeenpeople were killed and a number of people were injured, mostly by pieces of thebrick walls projected by the explosion.   Over a hundred people escaped unhurt.If the party wall had been of reinforced concrete it would most probably have held and there would have been no casualties. This is the most severe case of a bomb striking a steel framed building.   The comparatively slight casualties weie
purely due to the absence of collapse. In other cases bombs have not penetratedto this depth in such buildings, and people sheltering in the basement have been entirely unhurt.(7) Sloane Square Station.A very heavy bomb, probably 1,400 kg., penetrated the roof and into the base-ment of the booking hall of Sloane Square Station, where it struck a 4-ft. steelgirder and exploded. The adjoining brick arch collapsed, and a train standingunderneath was crushed. The upward blast of the explosion pushed out the sidewalls of the steel framed booking hall and caused extensive collapse of the floorand roof. In all, 42 people were killed and 29 seriously injured, mostly in the train. This is a case of the damage to be expected from very heavy bombs on one or two storeyed steel framed buildings; the weakness here was the good bondbetween the walls and the frame so that the internal pressure on them caused thestanchions to part from the roof girders and bring it down. It is interesting to note that the main girder, on which the explosion occurred, was not broken.(8) Bounds Green.A large bomb, probably 500 kg., struck two houses above the platform ofBounds Green Tube Station, penetrated some distance, probably 10 ft., into theground and exploded, completely demolishing the houses. The effect of the earthshock brought down an area of 20 x 10 ft. of the roof of the platform. Thetube was being used as a shelter by about 1,000 people. The breaking of the rooflet down many cubic yards of earth, which, with the cast-iron roof rings, burieda number of people sleeping on that part of the platform. Twenty-three people were killed and 26 seriously injured. There was no panic and the remainingoccupants of the shelter refused to leave it although the incident occurred earlyin the evening.The top of the roof was 33 ft. below ground level; this shows that this depth of cover is not sufficient against heavy bombs, indeed, we know from otherexamples that 60 ft. or more is required for complete protection. Nevertheless,it should be noted that the extent of the collapse was strictly limited to the area under the bomb, and that the proportion of casualties among the shelterers wasvery small.Table I (Appendix).Analysis of Disasters in which more than Twenty People were Killed.Type of building in which Number of Total of&apos;    incident occurred. incidents. persons killed.Strutted basements          ......... 8 420Subways, arches, &amp;c.        ......... 3 201Trenches      ............... 7Surface Shelters     ............ 2 84Tubes          ............... 2 90Railway Stations    ............ 2 bbHospitals, rest centres, &amp;c.        ...... 8 352Dwellings     ............... 5 ^Unspecified            ... &apos; &apos;-Total        .........      ...      41 1673
