Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET.W.P. (G) (41) 124.October 29, 1941.WAR CABINET.APPRECIATION OF THE POSITION IN SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion A fairs.I THINK that the attached despatch from the United Kingdom HighCommissioner at Pretoria, containing an appreciation of the effects of the warin the Union of South Africa, will be of interest to members of the War Cabinet.C.Dominions Office, October 29, 1941.Office of the High Commissioner(No. 126.   Secret.) for the United Kingdom,My Lord, Pretoria, August 12, 1941.IT has occurred to me that it may be useful to you to have towards thetermination of the second year of the war an appreciation of its effects in thiscountry and on our own attitude towards the Union. The paragraphs which follow necessarily recapitulate much that has already been reported in earliertelegrams and letters, but it is hoped that they will provide a background against which reports on specific developments and tendencies may have a greater value.2. The outstanding event of the war from the South. African point of view was the entry into it of Italy in June of last year, since the effect of this, coincidentas it was with the collapse of France, was almost to close the Mediterranean asa supply route to the Middle East and wholly to do so as a supply route for India.From then onwards the bulk of the sea-borne supplies for these areas had tocome round the Cape and the two ports of Cape Town and Durban became of paramount importance to the British Commonwealth in the prosecution of thewar. South Africa, indeed, has resumed for the whole British Empire the strategic importance which it had held prior to the opening of the Suez Canal in1869. The probability is that, with the revolution in strategy and tactics whichhas been brought about by the development of air power, it will never again bepossible to place such reliance on the Mediterranean route as was placed on it during the seventy years from 1869 to 1939. For the prosecution of the present warthe South African ports are, therefore, of vital importance to the British Common-wealth, and even in the post-war period I venture to think that no United KingdomGovernment will so soon forget the tragic lesson of the Irish ports as to acquiescewithout a struggle in their passing under the control of a Nationalist Govern-ment in the Union, since the avowed policy of the Nationalist party is to establish a republic, and their control would therefore be at best neutral, and at worsthostile.3. The implications of the changed value of the South African ports tothe British Commonwealth have not been lost on the South Africans themselves.It is questionable whether, if the Suez Canal had not been cut, Gladstone^Government would ever have surrendered to the Boers after the battle of Majubain 1881, but they did so and since that time, in spite of the interlude of theBoer War, it has been impressed on English-speaking South Africans by morethan one United Kingdom Government that, if it should ever again come to a[23083] copy. No. 5 g
&quot;show-down&quot; between them and the numerically larger Afrikaans-speakingsection of the population, they would be unable to rely upon the firm support ofthe United Kingdom.   This has resulted in tihe development among part of theEnglish-speaking section of a state of apathy, and almost of indifference, towardsthe political situation in the country.  The younger generation in particular were reluctant to enter or stand the racket of political life, whether in municipal orprovincial councils, or in Parliament, and their attitude was in marked contrast to the intense keenness and competition in these fields among the Afrikaners.The English-speaking members of the House of Assembly are in consequencenow qualitatively inferior to the Afrikaans-speaking members and, since theformation of the Union, have completely failed to produce any leader of, one might almost say, average, let alone outstanding, ability.   A similar process hasbeen at work in the civil service, and in the State-controlled South AfricanRailways and Harbours, the largest employers of white labour in the country.Since the time when, in both services, bilingualism became compulsory they have tended to be avoided by the English-speaking South Africans, and, since the moreambitious Afrikaners have devoted themselves to the law or politics, the standardof entries has declined generally.    The Nationalist Government from 1924onwards pursued a deliberate policy of giving preference to Afrikaners in thecivil service and railways, and, even though this process was checked by thePublic Service Commission, the latter was usually obliged to give preference toan Afrikaner when his qualifications were approximately equal to those of english-speaking candidates for promotion.   In consequence civil servants weretempted to play politics, a tendency which was emphasised by the growing strengthof the Nationalist political background on the home life of the younger Afrikanercivil servants.   The result has been that there is a very definite cleavage ofoutlook and an equally definite difference of quality between the older civilservants, represented by most of the present-day heads of departments, and therest of the civil service.  Almost all key-positions in the civil service to-day are held by men on the verge of retirement, and, as my predecessors have pointed out,the war, had it come five years later, would have found the control of the civilservice in the Union in very different hands from those which guide it to-day.Indeed, but for the loyalty and capacity of a dozen senior civil servants, about half of them of English, and the half of Afrikaner, descent, accustomed toco-operation with the British after the Boer War, it is very doubtful if general smuts and his Cabinet could have harnessed the administrative machine to thewar effort without a degree of opposition or passive obstruction which couldnot have been tolerated, but the suppression of which would probably have brought the whole machine to a standstill.   The consciousness that South Africa is once more of value to the British Commonwealth, that its resources are helping tomaintain the common struggle, that its industries are supplying the armies inthe Middle East, and that the South African forces are playing a conspicuouspart in the campaigns in Africa, has produced a healthy reaction in the English-speaking section by restoring their confidence in themselves.   They feel, on theone hand, that they are playing a worthy part in the life of their country, andin the war effort of the Commonwealth, and, on the other, that they have once more become the object of jealous concern to the United Kingdom and otherDominions.    In Parliament the supporters of the Government, from &quot;bigbusiness &quot;to extreme labour, have shown a degree of solidarity behind general smuts which made the last session of Parliament a unique one in the annals ofthe Union, while in the civil service sufficient of the younger English-speakingcivil servants and of Afrikaners who support the Government have shown suffi-cient readiness and ability to take responsibility to make possible some approach to that solidarity which war now forces upon more highly organised communities.But, even so, the machine in the Government^ hands is very short, of efficient staff to operate it, and there is no doubt that it is in part due to this, and not onlyto the more obvious political difficulties, that the Union has lagged behind therest of the Commonwealth in putting into effect the wide range of regulations and restrictions necessary to ensure the reduction of waste and the concentration of the whole economy of the country on matters essential to the war effort.4. The effect of the war on the Afrikaans-speaking section of the Union&apos;spopulation has been equally marked. When General Hertzog and his supporterswere defeated on the issue of participation in the war in September 1939 the
Nationalist opposition immediately exploited the break between General Smutsand General Hertzog to proclaim a reunion of Afrikanerdom in the ReunitedNationalist Party under the nominal leadership of General Hertzog but underthe de facto control of the now embittered Dr. Malan. This reunion might have resulted in something approaching the reunion of all Afrikaners, which had beenthe aim of the Nationalist Party since its formation and which has never existedsince the great trek of a hundred years ago. But the Nationalist wing of theReunited Party made the pace too hot to last. Both Nationalists and Hertzogitesagreed that the aim of the Reunited Party was an independent AfrikanerRepublic in South Africa divorced from all connection with the British Common-wealth, but General Hertzog and his followers sought to insist on, at any rate,lip-service to the ideal of equal rights for all South Africans, English orAfrikaans-speaking, within the Republic, and to impose the condition that itshould be proclaimed only by the will of the majority of the people of SouthAfrica. The Nationalists, on the contrary, maintained that a simple majority vote at any election would be fully sufficient, and, while admitting that theEnglish-speaking South Africans should enjoy full cultural and language rights,by implication they denied them equal political rights in the republic to be.Moreover, since the republic wTas to be run in the interests of the Afrikaans-speaking section of the people, it was not difficult to foresee that the economicand commercial rights of the English-speaking section would also be threatened.Such rights as were left to them would be of grace only. There would thus beevery possibility of a new &quot; uitlander &quot; agitation similar to that which provokedthe Jameson raid and ultimately the second Boer war.5.   These distinctions may have seemed at first to be somewhat academic,and bickerings about them within the Reunited Party might not have led to opencleavage but for the steady growth within the party of totalitarian ideas and atotalitarian organisation.   The chief apostle of these ideas was, curiously, theformer Hertzogite Minister of Defence, Oswald Pirow.  Mr. Pirow is of Germanparentage and he had been as greatly influenced by a visit which he paid toGermany in the latter part of 1938, which had left him convinced of the mightof Germany and profoundly impressed by the achievements of the national socialist regime as he was by the ease with which he Avas able to hoodwinkpeople in London.   Mr. Pirow began by proclaiming that it was the mission ofthe Reunited Party to rehabilitate the poor whites, of which there are 300,000in the Union, mostly Afrikaans-speaking and concentrated in the rural areas.The land was to be preserved exclusively for them, and British and Jewishcapitalists were no longer to be able to exploit the Afrikaners, whom he urged to unite for their defence, economically, socially and politically.  The gold mines,the press and the cinema should all be nationalised.  Mr. Pirqw&apos;s policy was wellcalculated to appeal to the pockets a&apos;s well as to the race-prejudice of theAfrikaner.   For years the farming community has been subsidised to the extent,it is calculated, of over  20 per annum per caput, man, woman and child, byGovernmental action and at the expense of the rest of the community, so that state assistance to the farmer is no novelty.   The rural Afrikaner, too, has remained as determined as the old Boers not to allow equal rights to the natives,Indians and coloured people of the Union.   He dislikes the towns which are atonce English-speaking and by his standards extravagantly wealthy and he owesmoney to the village store-keepers, who have usually been Jews.   The depressionof 1929-1933 drove thousands of Afrikaners from the country districts to the towns where they now form the bulk of the unskilled labour, especially amongthe Rand miners, and to these people it could be forcefully represented that atpresent the control of industry and the exploitation of the country&apos;s mineralwealth was in the hands of the &quot; foreign &quot; capitalists.6. Mr. Pirow was also alive to the advantages of a politician having at hisback an organisation based on cell lines and disciplined to follow him without question. lie first founded an organisation of his own, the Handhawersbond,which purported to be purely cultural but was clearly modelled on that of the nazi party in Germany. This organisation proved, however, to be a damp squib,partly because totalitarian ideas were still very much of a novelty in SouthAfrica and had been somewhat discredited in the shape of the German-controlled&quot; grey shirt &quot; organisation, partly because Mr. Pirow himself was still distrustedby the Nationalists as a Hertzogite, and partly because the &quot; Handhawersbond &quot;[23083] &apos;    b 2
found another so-called cultural organisation already in the field with, it was said,80,000 members, the &quot; Ossewa Brandwag.&quot; The latter had been formed a yearearlier as a result of the centenary celebrations of the Great Trek and its rapid growth was already a source of misgiving to the authorities. It had also been an object of considerable interest to the German representatives in the Union,who saw in it a possible alternative to the discredited &quot;grey shirts&quot; as the vehicle for their propaganda. The founders of the Ossewa Brandwag had otherideas in mind, however, than the establishment of an organisation for the dis-semination of German propaganda and the furthering of German aims in SouthAfrica and an early attempt to use it in this way resulted in the resignation ofits first &quot; General,&quot; Colonel Laas, early in 1940 and in temporarily discreditingthe Ossewa Brandwag as well as the Handhawersbond.7. The danger, however, was evident, and General Hertzog took advantageof the opportunity to try to bring the Nationalist section of the Reunited Partyto heel by calling on the Provincial Congress of the Orange Free State theprovince over which he had exercised unquestioned political control for 30 years to accept his own more moderate republican programme for the party instead ofthat issued by the Central Committee of the party under the inspiration of dr. Malan, the leader of the Nationalist wing. The distinction between the programmes was that General Hertzog&apos;s programme pledged equal rights in thefuture republic to the English-speaking section of the population, and this raised the discussion to the plane of principle, but General Hertzog did not neglectother weapons. He charged the Nationalist leaders in the Orange Free state with spreading a campaign of false rumours about his own sincerity, and he particularly denounced the chief among them, a former Private Secretary of hisown, for base calumny. General Hertzog showed all his old political skill inchoosing the issue and the field, and the subsequent hushing up of the Commissionof Enquiry which the Nationalist Party Central Executive Party felt obliged toappoint lends credence to his charges against Mr. Swart. It was the morestriking, therefore, when the Congress voted by a majority for the programmeof the Central Committee. General Hertzog at once walked out of the Congress,followed by his supporters, and a short while afterwards gave his approval tothe formation by them of a separate &quot;Afrikaner &quot; party, though he took theopportunity to announce his own retirement from politics. Mr. Havengafollowed General Hertzog into retirement, and both had the chagrin of seeing the by-elections for their constituencies won by Malanite Nationalist candidatesin straight fights with Afrikaner Party candidates.8. If General Hertzog had miscalculated his chances of success, eventsproved that he had not been under any misconception as to the importance of theissue before the Reunited Party. The victory of the Malanite Nationalists inthe Bloemfontein Congress was almost immediately followed by the emergenceinto the open of the pro-Nazis. Mr. Pirow skilfully exploited his own value tothe Nationalist Party, as the last justification for continuing to call itself&quot; Reunited,&quot; by insisting, as a condition of not following General Hertzog, onhis freedom to preach his &quot; new order &quot; of German type. He spent little timein the House of Assembly during the session of January to May of this year,but toured the rural constituencies of the Union indefatigably, addressingaudiences which numbered thousands. It was repeatedly reported that theorthodox Nationalists, led by Mr. Strydom, his rival for leadership of the nationalists in the Transvaal, were about to force a &quot;show-down,&quot; and eitherbring Mr. Pirow to heel or leave the party, but on every occasion so far Dr. Malanhas succeeded in avoiding a breach, and Mr. Pirow has gone on his energetic way.9. Mr. Pirow&apos;s success has undoubtedly been due to the steadily increasinginfluence, behind the scenes of the Ossewa Brandwag. This organisation wascarefully reorganised after the defection of Colonel Laas, and made rapid progress when it accepted as its leader the then Administrator of the OrangeFree State, Dr. van Rensburg, a lawyer of great ability and political skill.Dr. van Rensburg at once enforced strict discipline on all members of theorganisation, and so put an end to the beatings-up of opponents which werebringing it into disrepute and were provoking the Government into taking actionagainst them, while, by laying emphasis on its social programme, which appealed to the Afrikaner of the country districts, he steadily increased its membership.Dr. van Rensburg is, moreover, a close frend of Mr. Pirow&apos;s, and an early result
of his appointment was the dissolution by Mr. Pirow of the Handhawersbond,which removed the obstacle which had hitherto prevented the Ossewa Brandwagfrom giving Mr. Pirow its support and reaping in return the harvest of his &apos;&apos; new order propaganda. The membership of the Ossewa Brandwag six months agowas claimed to be over 300,000 (this figure may well include women and children),and it was stated quite openly that the police and magistrates in the country districts where the Ossewa Brandwag predominates take their orders from thelocal &apos;&apos; General &apos;&apos; of the organisation, while in many villages closing down noticeswere to be seen in the shop windows of the Jewish store-keepers. The member-ship has steadily increased in the past six months, and the contrast between theincreased strength of the Ossewa Brandwag and the bickering and disunionwithin the Reunited Party is so evident that it was decided at the Party Congressa month ago to reorganise the party on a cell basis and to associate it closely with the Ossewa Brandwag and the Reddingsdaad, an organisation formed toenable the Afrikaners to secure control of the economic life of the country. Thepresent position is, therefore, that the Ossewa Brandwag under Dr. van Rensburgand in close association with Mr. Pirow, appears to have captured the strongestof the old Opposition parties, and to be rapidly imposing its Nazi forms of discipline upon it. It is not expected that any Nationalist Party members willbe renominated in their constituencies when the elections take place without the prior endorsement of the Ossewa Brandwag. But the changes within theNationalist Party, using the term in its broadest sense, are kaleidoscopic, and itwould be unduly pessimistic to suppose that the opposition to General Smuts hasnow closed its ranks and become a united body. There are once more signs of extreme tension between the Parliamentarians, led by Dr. Malan and, in the transvaal by Mr. Strydom, and the totalitarians, represented by Mr. Pirow and dr. van Rensburg, and it remains to be seen whether Dr. Malan will once moreswallow the pill in private while in public blandly ignoring the existence of anymalady requiring surgical treatment. Moreover, Colonel Laas, the founder ofand former leader of the Ossewa Brandwag, who was displaced to make way forDr. van Rensburg, has just come out in the Press with a strong denunciation ofthe Nazification of the Movement. He deplores the doctrine of hate, which is soprominent, the division of the churches which has followed, and the &quot; muddlinginterference of professional politicians, who place selfish ambitions before the welfare of their people.&quot; He claims to be about to launch on a large scale arival organisation which already exists in embryo, the &quot; Boernasie,&quot; the constitu-tion of which will be published shortly. Colonel Laas wall probably cut little ice,but his statement well illustrates the &apos;.&apos; fissiparous tendencies &quot; so long attributed to the Afrikaner Republicans.10. The attitude of Dr. Malan and Mr. Pirow towards the war is nowquite frank. The Reunited Party are to be the fifth column in South Africa,ready to take over when the Nazis gain their victory in the north. (Dr. Malanhas recently repeatedly announced that Germany has, for all practical purposes,already won the war.) They state openly that the Germans will allow themcomplete control of the country, on condition of their severing its connexion withthe British Empire, and they blindly close their eyes to the example of evervother country the German forces have occupied. Dr. van Rensburg is outwardlymore cautious. He proclaims in public that the Ossewa Brandwag is a culturaland social, not a political, organisation, but his views are the same as those of dr. Malan and Mr. Pirow. Speaking at the University, Cape Town, that is toan audience which was hostile to the Ossewa Brandwag, he was cynically frank.He said &quot; the Afrikaner element, in so far as it is behind the Ossewa Brandwag,is in a very dangerous temper at the moment. It may, or may not, get out of hand. But we are anxious to avoid even the semblance of trouble, for the simplereason that you now have the guns and we have not.&quot; At present there is little likelihood of an attempt at a coup oVetat by the Ossewa Brandwag, because thereis no hope of its being successful, but if there were a real hope they might riseat once. A German victory in North Africa, involving heavy losses to the SouthAfrican Divisions, might well be regarded as the signal for demonstrations ofsome sort or another.11.   It is for this reason that it is imperative that General,Smuts retainsin the Union sufficient military forces to deal with any attempt at insurrection.The third Division of the Union Defence Force the first and second are in[23083] B 3
Egypt is, in fact, being organised essentially as an internal security force. its importance can be estimated when it is realised that police force, which is anational one, has for years been recruited from the poorer Afrikaners of thecountry districts, and that the reliable members of it were organised by theirCommandant as a Police Brigade and incorporated by him in the second divisionof the Union Defence Force when he took over command of the latter prior toits departure for the north. 90 per cent, of the remainder of the Police are said to be sympathetic to the Ossewa Brandwag, and to be on bad terms generally with the military forces. The Johannesburg riots of January last were muchmore Police versus Military than Military versus Ossewa Brandwag.But if open rebellion is regarded as impracticable or over-risky, there are other and less hectic possibilities, such as a concerted &apos;&apos; sit down &apos;&apos; strike orgo-slow policy on the part of all Ossewa Brandwag members. This, even if itcould not produce complete paralysis, might greatly impede public administra-tion and the operation of public services and slow down war production. Itwould be most difficult to take any effective military counter action, but there is perhaps some safeguard in the fact that the Trade Unions are solidly behind the Government. It will perhaps not be amiss if I draw attention in thisconnection to the potential danger arising from the, presence in the Union of many thousands of prisoners of war. So far the Union has agreed to receive 60,000,and the present policy is to concentrate them, for ease of guarding and adminis-tration, in very large&quot;camps. They are all trained soldiers, and if a camp couldbe rushed and arms distributed they would provide a very dangerous accession of strength to the Ossewa Brandwag, some of whose members are themselvesorganised as storm troopers and receive para-military training in secret. Thatthis is not a vain suggestion is shown by the fact that one such plot has alreadybeen reported to the authorities in connexion with the prisoners of war recep-tion camp at Clairwood, near Durban. And it must also be remembered that theGerman population of South West Africa numbers over 10,000, and that forseven years before the war they were organised on Nazi party lines, and took, inthe words of a Report on the administration of South West Africa in 1939, whichhas just been published, &quot; an oath of unbreakable allegiance to Adolf Hitler and unconditional obedience to the leaders appointed by him/&apos;12. As I have already indicated at the end of paragraph 9, the growth ofthe Ossewa Brandwag and the tendency of the Nationalist Party to totalitarian-ism has not taken place without arousing some opposition among influentialsections of the Afrikaans-speaking community. Within the ranks of the Opposi-tion it has galvanised the Afrikaner Party into some semblance of life. GeneralKemp, in the Transvaal, and the late Senator Fourie, in the Cape Province,former members of General Hertzog&apos;s Cabinet, decided not to follow general hertzog out of the Nationalist Party, and only 12 of the former 29 HertzogiteMembers of Parliament joined the Afrikaner Party under General Conroy inJanuary of this year. With no leader of any parliamentary capacity the Partytook little part in the debates of the last session, and forecasts of its early extinc-tion were rife. It was, however, slowly building up a new basis for its indepen-dent existence. It proclaimed that it would not hamper in any way theGovernment&apos;s war effort, though it would not participate in it, since SouthAfrica itself was now threatened by the enemy. It emphasised on all occasionsthat its chief tenet was the equality of all South Africans, Afrikaans- or English-speaking, and its firm adherence to democratic principles and opposition to totali-tarianism have given it a definite appeal to those older members of the DutchReformed Church, who were not prepared to close their eyes to the treatmentmeted out to the Protestant Chuch in Germany by the National Socialist Party.The Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church recently denounced totalitarian ideas,and their action was followed by an appeal to South Africans by 25 of the mostdistinguished Professors of the fervently Nationalist University of Stellenboschnot to be misled by the new doctrines&apos;coming into favour in the nationalist party. In consequence, the National Congress of the Afrikaner Party, which met in Pretoria in June, proved to be a far more lively affair than had been expected,and was crowned by the very definite success of inducing Mr. Havenga, withGeneral Hertzog&apos;s blessing, to come out of retirement and accept the leadership of the Party in the Union.13. Among the Afrikaans-speaking supporters of the Government the effectof the tendency of the Nationalist Party to totalitarianism has been to strengthen
their conviction that they were right in supporting General Smuts, and notGeneral Hertzog in September 1939, and there have been no signs at any time that Opposition propaganda has had any effect upon them. Approximately halfof all in the Union who have volunteered for military service have been Afrikaans-speaking, and in war industry, mining and transport their services have been as readily rendered as those of English-speaking South Africans. In the Govern-ment, in Parliament, in the Provincial Councils, and in local politics they areplaying a part the importance of which is out of all proportion to their numbers.This is partly due to the strategical importance of their position, holding as theydo the balance of power, but it is also due to the prestige and ability of some oftheir leaders, who include most of the surviving leaders of the Transvaal republic and the Orange Free State during the Boer War. In addition to General Smuts,there are in the Cabinet the Deputy Prime Minister, Colonel Denys Reitz, son of a former President of the Orange Free State; Mr. Hofmeyr, the Minister ofFinance, the ablest Minister after General Smuts, who is the nephew of thegreat Jan H. Hofmeyr who founded the old Afrikaner Bond; Colonel Comman-dant Collins, the Minister of Agriculture; Senator Conroy, the Minister of Lands;and Colin Steyn, Minister of Justice and son of yet another President of the orange Free State. The most outstanding figure in the economic life of theUnion, Chairman of the Iron and Steel Corporation of South Africa, theElectricity Supply Corporation, and the Finance and Mining Corporations, andDirector-General of War Supplies, Dr. H. S. van der bill, also belongs to this group. The Chief of the Union General Staff, General Sir Pierre van Ryneveld,the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Brigadier de Waal, the officerscommanding the three divisions of the Union Defence Force, Major-GeneralsBrink, de Villiers and Botha, the Adjutant-General, Brigadier Beyers (thegrandson of President Beyers), the D.G.A.F., Brigadier Venter, and the G.S.O.I.,First Division, Colonel Joubert (grandson of Commandant-General Joubert, whowas Commander-in-Chief of the Boer Forces in 1899).In marked contrast is the Nationalist Opposition, which, with the singleexception of the former Hertzogite, General Kemp, does not number among itsleaders one man who even fought for the Boer Republics, let alone led any oftheir forces. Finally, the Trade Unions, which staunchly support the Govern-menfs war effort, include many Afrikaans-speaking members, and some of themost important of them, for example the Mine-Workers&apos; Union, are said to beas much as 90 per cent. Afrikaans-speaking. Few, if any, of these Afrikanershave any sentimental loyalty to the Crown, but they have broken most of theirties with the past, and they co-operate in the convinced belief that the futureindependence of South Africa can be maintained only by continued membership of the British Commonwealth in a world from which the menace from Nazismhas been removed. They are bilingual, and they are seeking to bury the divisions of the past which have given South Africa to-day two flags, two anthems, twocapitals and two languages. These they replace by a common loyalty to the land of their birth, and to the traditions of liberty for which they or their fathersfought, and by a sober recognition of what is possible in world conditions to-daywhich prevents them from being led astray by the 19th century mirages on whichthe Nationalists feast their eyes. And they are helped by the strongest of allinfluences to co-operation between the two white races in South Africa, inter-marriage, which is to-day so usual that in the larger cities and towns, at any rate,it seems as much the rule as the exception.The effect of the conviction that a Nazi victory would mean the end of TradesUnionism in South Africa is to be seen in the support which the Labour party has given to the Government, in the defeat of that Nationalist bid for control ofthe Mine-Workers&apos; Union, and even more dramatically in the smaller incidentswhich are often brought to one&apos;s notice. For example, a Shift Boss on a minein Johannesburg, the miners in whose shift were 100 per cent. Afrikaners,recently told a member of my staff that a year ago the notice boards at the minewere placarded with notices of meetings of the Ossewa Brandwag organisation.At the present time every member of his shift subscribes  2 of his pay each month to the Spitfire Fund or funds for the relief of air-raid victims and others inEngland.It is the aim of the present Government, and must be the hope of all interestedin the future of South Africa, that this section of the Afrikaners should continueto increase its numbers and should maintain its present influence on the destiniesof the South African people.
14. It is against this background that the Union&apos;s war effort/outstandingin itself, shows to even more conspicuous advantage. Already 150,000 men andwomen are on full-time service in the armed forces, all of them volunteers. Thisout of a total white population of 2 million with an exceptionally high percentageof children, and of whom only some 800,000 are English-speaking, represents, sofar as information available here goes, a much larger proportion of the popula-tion than those serving in the armed forces of Canada or Australia. Inaddition the remainder of the possible two-thirds of the population who aresupporting the Government are continuing to run the gold mines at maximumcapacity, to expand the coal and iron production of the country not merely tosupply its own needs, but to supply coal for the Middle East and iron-ore forthe United Kingdom, have organised new secondary industries to produce avery large proportion of the ordinary needs of the Union and the territories tothe north of it in consumption goods, to equip the armed forces in clothing and weapons, to found and develop a munitions industry which is producing small-arms ammunition, bombs and shells, mortars, armoured cars, anti-tank guns,howitzers, &amp;c, not only for the South African forces, but to supply part of theneeds of the other British forces in the Middle East, to assemble and partlymanufacture armoured cars and army transport vehicles to the number of 10,000already, to work its railways and their workshops to a maximum capacity, todeal with the feeding, &amp;c, of large convoys of troops en route to the Middle East,to repair ships both of the Royal and Merchant Navies, and to cope with thegreat burden thrown on the Union ports by the closing of alternative routes tothe Middle East. Stations have been built or are building for an Air training scheme, the personnel employed in which will soon reach the figure of 25,000,the custody of 60,000 enemy prisoners of war has been accepted and arrangementsmade for receiving approximately 20,000 evacuee women and children, of whomsome 7,000 have already arrived. Details of the Union&apos;s war effort on the militaryand productive sides have been communicated to you, and I need not expand thisbrief summary further, but it is necessary to mention the above facts in order topermit of a correct appreciation both of the value of the South African contri-bution to the common effort and the grave political difficulties in which this isbeing made.15. The whole of South Africa&apos;s war effort has only been possible becauseof the extraordinary prestige, undaunted energy and comprehensive vision of one man the Prime Minister; it is he who brought South Africa into the war; itis he who has been personally responsible for the recruitment and organisationof the South African forces and for their despatch first to Abyssinia and then to the Middle East, and whose control of the whole country is so firm that,although his policy has been to allow the Opposition the greatest latitude, thereis no danger of a revolution succeeding, except possibly as an eventual consequenceof his death or the disappearance of any hope of bringing the war to a successful conclusion. He completely dominates his Cabinet and to a large extent theOpposition also. One of the members of the latter in the House of Assembly,when asked whether he was not going to support General Smuts, stated that hisprinciples would not let him do so, but then added, in response to the questionwhat he would do if the enemy threatened South Africa : &quot; Oh, JannieSmuts would never let them get here.&quot; His Cabinet, although it includes one man of outstanding intellectual ability and others who are of average competence,has in it no one with anything like his power or prestige in the country, and theposition as regards the succession to him is such that any choice would only, bea pis alter. It might be Colonel Reitz, as he alone has prestige with all sectionsof the community, but his health is not good, he is indolent to a fault, and he isno administrator. It is more likely to be Mr. Hofmeyr, Who has great ability and is a first-class administrator. But he is suspect as a Liberal, particularly asregards native affairs, over-orthodox as a Finance Minister and commands no real personal following in either the House of Assembly or in the country.Beyond these two there is no one with even a pretence of a claim to succeed.Many of them Messrs. Stallard, Stuttaford and Olarkson are old men with very mediocre administration capacity or political future. I do not hesitate tosay that the maintenance of the Union&apos;s war effort at anything like its present level is dependent on the life of General Smuts. It is for this reason that it mustbe of paramount concern to us to preserve his energies he is 71 and expose
him to no undue strain. It is not too much to say that all who are familiar with conditions in this country tremble with anxiety whenever it is known he has leftit and breathe a sigh of relief at his safe return, particularly when he has lefton a long trip by air. I feel that I should be remiss in my duty if I did not drawyour attention to the danger which is consequent on the frequent calls made upon general Smuts to visit the Middle East by air, and still more to visit London.The gains from his presence there are many and obvious, but they cannot, in my view, be in any way commensurate with the very grave risks involved in invitinghim to go.16. To summarise the above very briefly : the existing political situationin this country is one in which two not unequal parties are separated not only bythe normal divisions of political opinion usual in a democracy, but by their whole attitude towards the State and the existing order of society. The oneaccepts that order and seeks to obtain its aims through the form of democraticparliamentary government; the other rejects democratic government and seeks to establish a new order which, a large section openly admit, is to be a totalitarianone modelled on the Nazi regime in Germany. The one adheres firmly to membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations; the proclaimed object ofthe other is the establishment of a republic which will sever all ties with that commonwealth. The one aims at co-operation on an equal basis between the twowhite races in the Union; the other at domination by the Afrikaans-speakingrace in the Union and at the exploitation of the country for its sole benefit. Inconsequence of this fundamental cleavage of outlook, there can be no hope ofco-operation between the parties, but the corollary is that General Smuts&apos;smajority in the House of Assembly, though small, is for the moment secure. Inconsequence, there is little likelihood .of the Government being overthrown byordinary means. On the other hand, the main consideration which deters a largesection of the Opposition from using force is that the Government effectivelydisarmed them by calling in all rifles early in the war, and that, in consequence,a coup is not likely to succeed unless accompanied by help from without. Thehope of the Opposition is, therefore, a German military victory in Africa, or a japanese-cum-Vichy control in the Indian Ocean, in which event they would actas an active Fifth Column in the Union. To prevent this, General Smuts mustretain in the Union military forces strong enough to crush any attempt atinsurrection, and, naturally, ought to retain stronger forces here if the course ofthe war was going against us in the north that is, at a time when the need for reinforcing the armies in the north would be most urgent. The only other factor which might endanger the stability of the Government is the death of the PrimeMinister, and it is for this reason that I have ventured to stress the paramount importance of subjecting him to as few physical risks as possible. If his personalcontrol was removed, there is at present no one with anything approaching thesame capacity, character or power of decision to replace him, and we might eventually be faced with the break-up of the present Government. On the otherhand, for sheer reasons of political self-preservation, the various elements in thepresent Government Coalition would have to stand behind some leader, such asHofmeyr, and this should provide a stabilising factor. It is fairly certain thatthe supporters of the Government, who have given so generously of their men andtheir women, their energies and their resources to the common war effort, wouldresist, if need be by force, any attempt by a Nationalist Government, if one came into power, to withdraw the Union from the war. Such internecine strife inSouth Africa could, however, only have the effect of bringing almost to a stand-still the Union&apos;s war effort and prejudicing the security of our communications with the Middle East and the Far East.I am intending to follow this despatch with a second chapter, in which Ipropose to deal with possible future developments, such as electoral prospects andthe post-war position.I have the honour to be, my Lord,Your Lordship&apos;s most humble,obedient Servant,HARLECH.
