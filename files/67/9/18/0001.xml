(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY C*&apos; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET - COPY NO:    V ^W.P.(G)(41) 18frhh February. 1941. WAR CABINET.SUNDAY OPENING OF CIMMaS AND THEATRES.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND.In considering the question of the Sunday opening of cinemas andtheatres, the War Cabinet may wish to know what the position in scotland is.There is no ruling by the Court that the Old Acts relating toSabbath observance prohibit the opening of places of entertainment inScotland on Sunday:    a decision bearing on the point tends to the belief that they do not.     In many areas, however, Sunday opening except by consent of the Magistrates is prohibited by local byelaws or byconditions attached to theatre or cineioa licences.     In fact, Sunday opening for the public is rare, although in a number of areas the magistrates have sanctioned special performances for the Services.As the Home Secretary points out, neither the Sunday EntertainmentsAct, 1932, nor the Defence Regulation amending that Act, applies inScotland.     On the other hand, law does not appear to prevent the magistrates in Scotland, if they are so disposed, from allowing Sunday opening in order to provide entertainment for the Services or formunition workers.     I understand that the Scottish Command are suggesting,through the Convention of Royal Burghs, that the Magistrates should allowSunday opening more freely outwith church hours in the interest of theServices.I have recently received a strong deputation from all the ProtestantChurches in Scotland urging that no Government action should be taken which would remove existing safeguards against the unrestricted use of sunday for public entertainments, and especially that no action shouldbe taken to over-ride the powers of local authorities.     I am convincedthat action to allow the opening of cin..:as or theatres on Sundayirrespective of the views of the local authority of the area would be widely resented and would, from the point of view of our war effort, do more harm than good.     I should therefore htve to oppose most stronglyany suggestion that the existing law on the subject in Scotland shouldbe altered, and while I see no objection to the informal approach whichhas been made by the Scottish Command to the Convention of Royal Burghs,I should regard it as very unwise to attempt to influence Scottishauthorities by administrative action such as the Home Secretary contem-plates in England to permit freer opening of cinemas and theatres on sunday.E.B.Scottish Office,Whitehall, S.W.1.6th February, 1941.
