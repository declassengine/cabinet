Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET.W.P. (G) (41) 121.October 27, 1941.WAR CABINET.UNIFORMS FOR ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIES WOMEN WORKERS.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.I ASK the approval of the Cabinet for the equipping of the Royal OrdnanceFactories women workers with a uniform, coupon free.The work in these factories is hard. Often it is dangerous. Most of the factories are in outlying districts, involving long journeys, with a consequentdanger to health in the winter months.If women are to be attracted to this vital national work, the appeal mustbe based on something more potent than wages alone.They must be provided with the outward insignia of their status as front-line workers, a distinctive and pleasing uniform.This project will simply put them on an equality with other women&apos;services.And if my proposal is rejected, women will perish for want of clothes duringthe winter months. The average number of coupons now held by these women forthe purchase of winter clothing is four, which is equivalent to two pairs ofstockings.On humane grounds it will be necessary to make some special provision forthe better clothing of women engaged in duties imposing a heavy physical strain.This provision should be a uniform.B.October 27, 1941.Copy No.[23068]
