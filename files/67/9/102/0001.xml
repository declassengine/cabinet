THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1941.SECRET. Copy No.    513w,p, (g) (m m.September 25, 1941,WAR CABINET.REPORT ON VISIT TQ NATAL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I THINK the following passage from a despatch in which Lord Harlech,the United Kingdom High Commissioner in the Union of South Africa, describedhis recent visit to Natal, will be of interest to the War Cabinet.C.Dominions Office, September 25, 1941.Extract from a Despatch dated August 6, 1941, from the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in the Union of South Africa.&quot; In conclusion I report my first impressions of Natal the still over-overwhelmingly British Province of the Union in South&apos; Africa but as yet not of it.Throughout my visit to Natal I never heard a word of Afrikaans spoken, saw anAfrikaner (other than one or two Officers in the Union Defence Force), or saw a notice or advertisement except on the railways and Central Government buildings,in anything but English. I was told that three-quarters of the Europeans inNatal have never been outside Natal except to go home and by home they meanGreat Britain. The whole &apos; ethos &apos; is that of a separate and self-contained BritishColony, fearing the Dutch South Africans and quite out of contact with them.Many Natalians are more British than the British-everywhere you see UnionJacks and very, very rarely a South African nag.- They think in terms of Natalor even more parochially of Durban and Pietermaritzburg and Ladysmith. the square in Pietermaritzburg is full of old war memorials of Zulu and Boerwars, surrounding the statue of Sir Theophilus Shepstone who occupied Pretoriain 1877. The days of Spion Kop and Sir Redvers Buller are still vivid in theirmemories and traditions. Pretoria, Johannesburg and even Cape Town seem ofa different world, and the subtropical vegetation, the fields of sugar cane, thegroves of bananas and mangoes, the Indian settlements all combine to make onefeel it is an entirely different country from the rest of South Africa. Natal isa backward-looking, charming and beautiful but self-sufficient island below theDrakensberg. But Durban itself is now a large wealthy and thriving city withan active and progressive Municipality. It is growing and is attractingindustrial development of its own special kind, especially sugar products, canning,jam making and provisioning, soap boiling and the like. It is a big place witha population (Greater Durban) of about 300,000, equally divided into thirdsbetween Europeans, Indians and Zulus. The colour bar between all these threeelements is rigid and complete.&quot;It is a pity that the British in Natal are as introvert as the ossewa brandwag in the backveldt of the Orange Free State and the Western Transvaal.They are throwing up no one (except a few business men) with a South Africanconsciousness, certainly none in political or public life. For them the Empire[22945]
consists of Natal arid the Old Country. They lack vision, leadership, and any sense of the coming storms and stresses of the next generation, either in Africa orthe rest of the world. The social and economic order is static and the climatede-energizing intellectually. Even physically you do not see in Natal-the-.samehard, tough, raw-boned boys you see everywhere in the Transvaal. Life is tooeasy, too soft, too conservative and too charming amid the outward luxuriaritbeauty of lowland Natal. It is really a tragedy for the future of British influence in the evolving South Africa. Any talk and I indulged freely in &quot;it myself-ofthe necessity for racial co-operation, leaves them cold. It is not within theirhorizon. Consequently, they are a positive danger a rock of offence amid theelan of the young Afrikaner of the other three provinces with their fierce SouthAfrican patriotism. If the Transvaal is like the West Biding of Yorkshire, Natalis like residential settlements in Sussex.&quot; As British High Commissioner my reception was almost too warm andpositively embarrassing. I have added this rather lengthy fugue, because injudging up any particular problem it is necessary to convey some idea of theframe as well as the picture the background as well as the foreground. Thedifficulties of the Union authorities in dealing with anything in Natal have tobe appreciated.&quot;
