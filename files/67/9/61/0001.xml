CONFIDENTIAL.[C 7541/65/17]Sir R. Campbell to Viscount Halifax. -(Received July 2.)My Lord, June 27, 1940.BEFORE giving your Lordship a consecutive account of events from thedate of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy&apos;s departure from Paris up to the acceptance byMarshal Petain&apos;s Government of cruel and humiliating armistice terms, I should like, by way of preface, to say that our activities during the whole of this periodwere considerably hampered by the conditions in which we were living and working. The Government had persistently refused to face up to the possibilityof having to remove from the capital, with the result that, when it had to do soat short notice or risk falling into the enemy&apos;s hands, it was obliged, in theabsence of other arrangements, to fall back on the scheme prepared before theoutbreak of war to meet the event, which then seemed probable, of Paris being subjected to constant aerial bombardment. The essence of this plan was to spread the executive and administrative services over a wide area in the Tourainerather than concentrate them in one spot, such as the town of Tours itself, wherethey would have offered a single and tempting target. During the three days of our stay in Touraine it was thus extremely difficult to maintain close contact with Ministers or their departments.2. In Bordeaux, whither the Government shortly repaired, our difficulties,though for different reasons, were nearly as bad. Conditions at the consulate,where, in default of other premises, I attempted to establish His Majesty&apos;s embassy, defy description. The diplomatic and consular staffs, numbering somethirty people, had only three rooms (one of them small) in which to carry on their work, including that of dealing with British refugees who streamed in day and night, demanding to be evacuated, and who at one moment got out of hand andfilled the staircase in a solid mass, completely blocking access or egress.Conditions in our hotel, where we later decided to set up the chancery, were little better. A further difficulty was that Ministers were dotted about in different parts of the town and frequently changed their habitat. No sooner had Isucceeded in locating one than I was informed, on my subsequent visit, that hehad moved to another address which no one could tell me. The town was packedwith refugees, both on foot and in vehicles of every kind and description, andcirculation was consequently a slow and laborious process.3. I have felt bound to give this picture of the physical conditions in whichwe lived and moved as they constituted a serious handicap to our activities.4. Passing now to a narrative account of events from the date of ourdeparture from Paris, it will be convenient to record them, as they occurred day by day, in chronological sequence.Paris, June 9.5. The French Government decided to put into force the second stage oftheir plan for their evacuation from Paris. Several Government Departmentsevacuated hurriedly the greater part of their personnel, leaving only a nucleusin Paris. This decision had been accelerated by the imminent fall of Rouen. i accordingly decided to send on the following morning an advance party of mystaff to the Chateau de Champchevrier at Clere, in Touraine, which had been allotted to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy before the outbreak of war, and which hadalready been reconnoitred.Paris, June 10.6. The advance party of the embassy left. I had arranged through theair attache for a wireless receiving and transmitting set to be sent out by theAir Ministry in order that it might be possible to maintain communication with london by this means wherever we might be.[21475]   [22637] B
7. At about noon I learned from Captain de Margerie, M. Reynaud&apos;s*&apos; chef de cabinet,&quot; that the Government was leaving that day, and that all theremaining members of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were leaving at 3 p.m.I accordingly decided to hand over the embassy to Mr. Bullitt, the United states ambassador, and to leave Paris with the rest of my staff the same evening. TheSecretary of State for the Colonies arrived in Paris by air during the afternoon.Lord Lloyd was able to see M. Reynaud, General Weygand and members of theFrench Government before leaving with me later in the evening. He left for england from Chateaudun by air on the following morning.8. My final interviews with M. Reynaud and other Ministers left me underthe impression that the general situation was better than I had at one timethought possible. The morale of the army was improving, and there appearedto be a general determination to fight to a finish. General Weygand seemed morecalm and resolute than he had been for some days, and M. Reynaud himself wasin good heart. I drove out of the embassy shortly before 9 p.m. Mr. Spurgeon,the head chancery messenger, was left in charge, assisted by Mrs. Spurgeon,Gabriel Trowbridge, chancery messenger, and Mr. Christie, the gate porter, withhis wife. They had all volunteered to remain. The United States ambassador had told me that he would send a representative to the embassy on the following morning to take over and to affix seals and printed notices stating that thepremises were under the protection of the United States Embassy.Touraine, June 11.9. After a nightmare drive over roads crowded with streams of motor cars,farm-carts, army transport and other means of locomotion, I arrived at theChateau de Champchevrier at about 4 a.m. At times there were no less than three lines of traffic on the roads proceeding towards the south-west. the refugees from the north were already on their way beyond Paris, and the evacua-tion of Paris itself was now in full swing. In the circumstances I was fortunatein only taking some seven hours to reach my destination. The appalling-conditions may be realised by the fact that Colonel Vanier, the Canadian Minister,who was detained in Paris and left about two hours later than I, took nineteenhours for the same journey owing to the ever-increasing congestion on the roads and to delays caused by air-raid warnings. I should here mention that duringthe days preceding our evacuation from Paris and subsequently I maintained the closest contact with Colonel Vanier and Mr. Bain-Maris, the South AfricanMinister, and our close and daily contact continued until our arrival in England.On parting at Paddington station on arrival in London they were good enoughto express their appreciation of what I had done in this respect.10. On reaching our destination in the Touraine, we found that the ministry for Foreign Affairs was established at Langeais, about 18 kilom. from theChateau de Champchevrier, the Ministry of Finance was at Chinon, about50 kilom. distant, the Ministry of the Interior was at Tours, about 28 kilom., theAir Ministry was at Amboise, and the Ministry of War was still further, while theMinistry of Supply was established somewhere in the Massif Central, 200 kilom.away. No attempt had been made beforehand to improve telephonic communication-tion, which was purely rural. It was almost impossible to get into telephoniccommunication with any Ministry, and the only way of getting into touch withanyone was to get into a motor car and go to what was supposed to be his head-quarters, but frequently was not, over roads thronged with refugee traffic of everydescription. I had also arranged for the assistant provost-marshal and his staff from Paris to be accommodated in the village of Clere, and the two motor-cyclistdespatch riders whom Major Bassett-Wilson placed at my disposal provedinvaluable, as I was thus enabled to maintain a regular service to the telegraphoffice at Tours, where all our telegrams were received and from which a?l ourtelegrams were despatched (the wireless set proved a failure), with a minimumexpenditure of petrol a most important consideration.11. In the above circumstances it was inevitable that much of my time should be spent on the road. M. Reynaud had not yet reached Tours, and afterleaving Paris he had spent the night of the lOth-llth June at General Weygand&apos;sheadouarters. The Government at Tours was thus without a head,&apos; thoughM. Mandel, the Minister of the Interior, did his best to contend with the situationand to reduce the chaos to some form of order.
12. During the morning I succeeded in finding the Ministry for ForeignAffairs, where I saw M. Baudouin, the Under-Secretary of State, and M. CharlesRoux, the Secretary-General. They were in complete ignorance of what was going on, having had no news since they left Paris on the previous day. Therewere about 300 telegrams at the post office at Tours, which the cyphering clerksof the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who had been travelling all night, were tootired even to look at. It was clear that the wiser heads considered Touraine tobe only a stage of the French Government&apos;s retreat, and the only question seemedto be whether they would move to Brittany, which was M. Reynaud&apos;s idea, or toBordeaux. I was able to transact some current business with M. Baudouin, whoinformed me that he had been empowered by the President of the Council to takeanv decisions that might be required of M. Reynaud in his capacity of Ministerfor Foreign Affairs. Cabinet councils were held both in the morning and in the evening, but no business could be transacted as M. Reynaud had not yet arrived.I was able to see M. Mandel at the Prefecture at Tours during the afternoon.He told me that he was trying to concentrate all Government Departments inTours itself, as it was impossible to transact business owing to the distances whichat present separated them.13. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for War flew over from england and met M. Reynaud and General Weygand at the latter&apos;s headquarters at Briard. I did not learn of this meeting until after the Prime Minister&apos;?arrival. Mr. Churchill and Mr. Eden returned to England on the following-morning, the 12th June.Tour aim, June 12.14. I continued my efforts to establish contact with French Ministers.M. Reynaud arrived towards evening and established his office at the Chateau deChissay, between Tours and Amboise, a drive of about two hours from my head-quarters. It was necessary either to make a long detour or to spend half an houror so crossins; the bridge at Tours, where the traffic confusion was indescribable.General Spears joined me at the Chateau de Champchevrier the same evening,and was able to inform me of what had passed at the meeting between the PrimeMinister and Mr. Eden and M. Reynaud and General Weygand.Touraine, June 13.15. During the morning I called on M. Reynaud at his headquarters,accompanied by His Majesty&apos;&quot;s Minister and General Spears. M. Reynaudinformed me that he had decided to follow up the appeal which he had madeto President Roosevelt on the 10th June by a further appeal, making it clearthat the salvation of France depended on am imminent declaration of war bythe United States of America, and that France was in the position of a drowningman calling for succour. He also told me that he had been in telephonic corn-munication with the Prime Minister, and had asked him to come out again for a meeting of the Supreme War Council on the same day. Mr. Churchill,accompanied by His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,Lord Beaverbrook, Sir A. Cadogan, and members of the War Cabinet Secretariat,arrived in Tours shortly before 2 p.m., and the meeting of the War Cabinet, atwhich I was present, was held at the Prefecture during the afternoon.16. M. Reynaud, who was assisted by M. Baudouin, opened the proceedingsby stating that he had been urged by his colleagues to enquire whether, sincethe complete military defeat of France was only a matter of days, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be willing to release the French Government from their obliga-tioh not to sue separately for armistice terms or conclude a separate peace.He said that he had decided to send a last appeal to President Roosevelt, inwhich he would make it clear that a declaration of war by the United Statesof America was the only thing which could give the French people the courageto continue the struggle until there was not a man left standing. The PrimeMinister spoke in warm and generous terms of the sufferings of France, and said that he understood that in her desperate plight she might be forced to lavdown her arms. It was a different matter, however, for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to become a consenting party and to give the French Government in advancea formal release from their engagement. Before pursuing the matter further,it would be well to await President Roosevelt&apos;s reply, on receipt of which a[21475] b 2
number of questions, apart from that put by M. Reynaud, would have to bediscussed. At this point the meeting adjourned, and the British Ministers hada brief consultation in the garden of the Prefecture. They decided that theline taken by the Prime Minister must be maintained. This was conveyed toM. Reynaud on the resumption of the meeting. Reference was made to certain military matters, but as they are not germane to this report I will pass the mover.17. The Prime Minister and his party left for England by air at about-30 p.m. At about 8 p.m. I learned that selected members of the ministry for Foreign Affairs had received orders to have their suitcases packed, theirmotor cars ready, as they would probably have to take the road to Bordeauxat dawn on the following day. They were awaiting a final decision. we accordingly made preparations for another move. We reduced our alreadyexiguous archives still further, and cut down our personal luggage to a suitcaseor two apiece. It was necessary also to leave in the Chateau certain officefurniture, which was had brought with us from Paris.18. It became clear during the day that the political situation had deteriorated. Rumours spread at Tours, after the departure of the british ministers, to the effect that Great Britain would liberate France from herengagements if America did not declare war. M. Mandel advised GeneralSpears privately that it would be most desirable to make it clear in documentsthat must be placed before the French Cabinet that in no case would Englanddo this. His Majesty&apos;s Government should at the same time make it clear thatthey undertook to carry on the struggle with all their strength. The FrenchCabinet had got as far as discussing the fate of the French navy in the caseof an armistice, and if a vote had been taken the majority of the FrenchCabinet would have been in favour of an armistice. The only Ministers whoshowed any backbone at the Cabinet meeting were M. Mandel, M. Marin andM. Campinchi; M. Reynaud himself was in a mood of indecision.Touraine, June 14.19. General Spears arrived at about 12-30 a.m. with a message for me from M. Mandel that the embassy should be on the road to Bordeaux by 10 a.m.as tanks had broken through at Evreux, were heading south and might reachTours during the day. I sent letters round by despatch riders to the canadian and South African Ministers informing them of the position and that I wasleaving at 10 a.m.20. I should here place on record that the Baronne de Champchevrier dideverything she could to make our stay in her Chateau comfortable and agreeable.She contrived to supply meals for the sixteen members of the embassy, who wereaccommodated in the Chateau, and for about thirty others, who were accom-accommodated in the outbuildings.21. At 10 a.m. we left for Bordeaux, where we arrived at about 7 p.m.The first part of the journey, especially the passage through Tours, was obstructedby the flood of refugees, but the latter part was uneventful.Bordeaux, June 14.22. On arrival at Bordeaux I went to the consulate-general, where I was told by Mr. Dible that he had been summoned to the Prefecture two hourspreviously and informed that the embassy had been allotted the Chateau Filhotat Sauternes, about 50 kilom. distant. I confirmed from the Prefecture that thiswas indeed the arrangement and learned that there was no accommodation available in Bordeaux itself. I at once visited the Minister of the Interior, andM. Mandel kindly arranged to have ten rooms in the Hotel Montre requisitionedfor me and the indispensable members of my staff. I accordingly moved therewith the chancery and the military and air attaches. The remainder went toChateau Filhot. I summoned Commander Cunard, the assistant naval attache,who was at Nantes, to join me with all speed. The naval attache, in his capacityof naval liaison officer, was still with the French Ministry of Marine in theneighbourhood of Tours.23. The chase for Ministers now began once again. After dinner, GeneralSpears and I succeeded in running M. Reynaud to earth and handed him the messages of encouragement contained in your telegrams Nos. 351 and 352.
M. Reynaud was in an unreceptive mood and did not respond to my remarks tothe effect that I did not, think that His Majesty&apos;s Government would willinglyaccept the idea of France abandoning the struggle. He said that his position was not an easy one, faced as he was with the possibility of Marshal Petain andGeneral Weygand handing in their resignations. The only bright spot in the conversation was that M. Reynaud spoke of the withdrawal of the Governmentto North Africa and told us that he had sent General de Gaulle to London to enquire about the transport of war material. We reminded him that the PrimeMinister and your Lordship had said that you preferred not to commit yourselvesin any way until President roosevelt&apos;s answer to M. Reynaud&apos;s second appealhad been received. It was impossible to get M. Reynaud to talk rationally. Inreporting this interview, I expressed the fear that the majority of his colleagues were working on him all the time in a defeatist sense, while he himself swayedbackwards and forwards, and I recommended that, in order to strengthenM. Reynaud&apos;s hands with his colleagues, it should be made plain that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would not be able to condone the breach of the no-separate-peace agreement.24. During the first few days in Bordeaux I wras able to be in telephoniccommunication with London, but this was later interrupted.Bordeaux, June 15.25. The situation was now deteriorating rapidly. It became more and moredifficult to obtain a straight answer to a straight question or a definite expression of opinion. Ministers sought refuge in talking about the impossibility for theFrench troops to stand firm in their present state of fatigue, and of the necessityof putting an end to present conditions and of preventing anarchy.26. Throughout these days I was bringing all the pressure I could to bearon French Ministers and other prominent political personalities with whom Iwas able to make contact, with a view to stiffening their will to resistance. Icontinued to make it plain that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not be expectedto liberate France from her word.27. I felt that, if President RoosevelCs reply to M. Reynaud&apos;s message ofthe 14th June did not contain the assurance that the United States would comeinto the war at a very early date, the French decision to ask for an armisticemight follow very rapidly. In this event, General Spears and I would do our utmost to obtain a satisfactory decision in regard to the fleet. In reporting to your Lordship in the above sense at midday, I felt bound to add that we had little confidence left in anything. The situation reached the stage when I found it necessary to ask for a warship to be sent to Bordeaux as soon as possible forthe evacuation of the staffs of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, of the Canadian andSouth African Legations and of the Polish and Belgian Governments, if HisMajesty&apos;s Government agreed to receive them.28. The French Cabinet met in the early afternoon. The tendency now wasto have two Governments, one in France to negotiate with the enemy, the otherto continue the struggle from Africa. Marshal Petain was to be head of theformer and M. Reynaud of the latter, but the plan, as I reported in my telegramNo. 409, was unlikely to materialise if the United States did not declare war.Marshal Petain was determined to resign unless an armistice were asked for,or unless the United States declared war. General Weygand was of the same opinion. In these circumstances I expressed to your Lordship the hope that theBritish troops would be withdrawn to cover the harbours, and that as manyFrench troops as possible should be embarked.29. Shortly after I had drafted the above telegram, M. Reynaud informed me that he was summoning a Cabinet Council, that he could no longer withstandthe constant pressure which was being brought to bear on him, and that the time had come when he must have a clear understanding with his colleagues. he intended to take the line that, whatever terms the Germans might offer, whateverpromises they might make, France, if she failed her Ally and made a dishonour-able peace, would sooner or later share the fate of all the countries which had hitherto fallen under Nazi domination. Such a peace would mean centuries ofservitude, and reduce France to the status of Slovakia. If M. Reynaud failed toget sufficient support, he would resign. At best he expected four or fiveresignations, including possibly that of Marshal Petain.   At one stage in the
conversation M. Eeynaud said that in no circumstances would he ever be a partyto surrendering the French fleet and allowing it to be used against a loyal Ally.I assumed from this that some of his colleagues would not stop short of this act of treachery. I delivered to M. Reynaud the message contained in your telegramNo. 357, to the effect that General Weygand had informed General Brooke thatorganised French resistance had ceased. In these circumstances, disembarkationof any further British forces in France was being stopped and the very largeLine of Communications personnel between Rennes and Nantes were being-evacuated.30. Late in the evening, M. Reynaud communicated to me a message for thePrime Minister, which represented a formal decision taken after a meeting ofthe Cabinet presided over by the President of the Republic. The message wasto the following effect: The Council of Ministers decided that the Governmentshould not leave France unless it were established that the peace conditions imposed by Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini were unacceptable, as being-contrary to the honour and the vital interests of France. The council did not doubt that these conditions would be unacceptable, but they considered itindispensable that this should be proved beyond doubt, in default of which theGovernment would break up, a large number of its members refusing to leave the soil of France. In order to learn the German and Italian conditions, the councildecided to seek His Majesty&apos;s Governments authorisation to enquire whatarmistice terms would be offered to France by the German and Italian Govern-ments. If His Majesty&apos;s Government authorised the French Government to take this step, the President of the Council was authorised to declare to His MajestydsGovernment that the surrender of the French fleet to Germany would be consideredan unacceptable condition. If the British Government withheld its consent tothis step, it seemed probable that the President of the Council would have no alternative but to resign. The President of the Council had just received the answer of Mr. Roosevelt, who had declared himself unable to give the Allies themilitary assistance asked of him. It had been agreed at the meeting of theSupreme War Council held at Tours on the 13th June that the question ofauthorising the request for an armistice would be reconsidered if president roosevelt&apos;s reply was negative. This eventuality having materialised, thequestion must now be put afresh. M. Reynaud begged insistently for a replyearly on the morning of the 16th June. (The text of the document containing this message, as handed to me by M. Reynaud, forms Annex 1 to this despatch.)31. M. Reynaud explained verbally to General Spears and myself that themajority of the Ministers had taken the line that the Government would beregarded as having taken flight if they moved overseas without having previouslyascertained that the armistice terms were unacceptable. M. Reynaud, who seemedto have put up a good fight, but to have been beaten by numbers, made it clear that,if His Majesty&apos;s Government refused to authorise the French Government to askfor armistice terms, he would resign, as he would in no circumstances repudiatea document to which he had put his signature. Great pressure, he added, hadbeen exercised by General Weygand, who had said that the army might break-up at any moment.Bordeaux, June 16.32. During the afternoon I received your Lordship&apos;s telegrams containingHis Majesty&apos;s Governments reply to the above communication, which stated ineffect that, although the Anglo-French Agreement forbidding separate negotia-tions, -whether for an armistice or peace, involved the honour of France, HisMajesty&apos;s Government nevertheless gave their full consent to an enquiry by theFrench Government to ascertain the terms of an armistice for France, provided,but only provided, that the French fleet was sailed forthwith for British harbourspending negotiations. The message added that His Majesty&apos;s Government, beingresolved to continue the war, wholly excluded themselves from all part in theenquiry concerning an armistice. His Majesty&apos;s Government also stated thatthey expected to be consulted as soon as any armistice terms were received, andin stipulating for the removal of the French fleet to British ports they had inmind French interests as well as their own. General Spears and I delivered theabove messages as soon as they had been decyphered. M. Reynaud, who was ina dejected mood, as he had that morning with difficulty induced Marshal Pefcain
to return his written resignation to his pocket, did not take them well, and atonce remarked that the withdrawal of the French Mediterranean fleet to british ports would invite the immediate seizure of Tunis by Italy, as well as create difficulties for the British fleet. At this stage in our conversation General de gaulle telephoned from London a message from the Prime Minister suggesting that M. Reynaud should join in issuing forthwith a declaration announcing theimmediate constitution of the closest Anglo-French union in all spheres in orderto carry on the war. The draft declaration, as authorised by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, stated that France and Great Britain should no longer be twonations, but one Franco-British union; there would be joint organs of defence,foreign, financial and economic policies, joint citizenship, a single War Cabinet,and the two Parliaments would be formally associated. The union w-ould concen-trate its whole energy against the power of the enemy no matter where the battlemight be.33. The message, the full text of which forms Annex 2 to this despatch,acted like a tonic on M. Reynaud, who said that for a document like that he wouldfight to the last. M. Mandel and M. Marin, who joined us for a moment, were equally relieved, and M. Reynaud left with a light step to read the document tothe President of the Republic. At this point I received a message stating thatthe communications which I had just made regarding the conclusion of an armistice should be regarded as cancelled, and I informed M. Reynaudaccordingly.34. Later the same evening I learned that a ministerial crisis had opened,and that the President of the Republic was consulting the Presidents of theChamber and Senate. In these circumstances the meeting which had beenarranged to take place the following day between the Prime Minister andM. Reynaud at an intermediate spot had unfortunately to be cancelled. (ThePrune Minister had, in fact, already left London by train on his way to the placeof meeting in Brittany.) We saw M. Reynaud again that night, when he informed us that the forces against him in the Government had been too strong and that he had handed in his resignation. The combination of Marshal Petainand General Weygand, who w7ere living in another world and imagined that theycould sit round a green table discussing armistice terms, had proved too much for the weaker members of the Government, on whom they worked by waving thespectre of revolution. He had read the Prime Minister&apos;s message twice to theCouncil of Ministers, and explained its import and the hope which it held forthe future, but all to no avail. M. Reynaud had not informed the Council ofMinisters of the two earlier messages referred to in paragraph 32 above, but therehad been general assent Avhen he said that he assumed that they still held thatthe surrender of the fleet, which would be a stab in the back of an ally, w^ould beregarded as an unacceptable condition.Bordeaux, June 17.35. Marshal Petain succeeded in forming a new Government in the earlyhours of the morning.  Its chief members were :  M. Chautemps, Vice-President of the Council.General Weygand, Minister for National Defence.General Colson, Minister for War.Admiral Darlan, Minister of Marine.General Pujo, Minister for Air.M. Baudouin, Minister for Foreign Affairs.M. Bouthillier, Minister of Finance.M. Pomaret, Minister of the Interior.M. Frossart, Minister of Public Works.M. Mandel, M. Marin and M. Campinchi, who had been the most stalwartsupporters of M. Reynaud in pursuing a firm policy, were conspicuous by their absence from the new Government, whose complexion was clearly defeatist. its first act was to ask for armistice conditions. M. Baudouin, the new Minister forForeign Affairs, informed me at 1 a.m. that this decision had been inspired solely by the fact that the French armies, surrounded and broken up, were no longerable to stand up to the enemy. France was militarily beaten, and it was only amatter of a very few days before the German armies would have become masters
of the whole country. General Weygand had been warning the Government forseveral days that he could no longer guarantee that the men would not turn ontheir officers. The sufferings of the civil population were appalling. No Govern-ment could have left France at this moment under the appearance of abandoning the people to their fate. The new Government had, therefore, felt compelledto ask, through the Spanish Government, for the cessation of hostilities, andto be informed on what conditions an armistice would be granted. If theconditions were such that their acceptance would be a stain on the honour ofFrance, they would be refused, but the people would then know that theirsufferings could not have been avoided. Among such conditions, the mostdishonouring would be the surrender of the fleet, and he was authorised to give me the Governments formal assurance that, although they expected this to be one of the conditions, it would in no circumstances be accepted. The appointmentof Admiral Darlan as Minister of Marine would offer His Majesty&apos;s government an additional guarantee, if it were needed. The change of Government, continuedM. Baudouin, implied no change of heart towards their ally. The generous wordsspoken by the Prime Minister at Tours encouraged them to hope that, although his Majesty&apos;s Government could not approve of the French Governments action,they would understand it.36. M. Baudouin repeated several times the assurance about the fleet. on each occasion I said that I took formal note of his words on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government. Apart from expressing great distress that a FrenchGovernment should have gone back on the signature of an&apos; agreement expresslydesigned to prevent such a thing happening, I thought it well to restrain myselffrom indulging in any severe recrimination, such as might create an impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government would henceforward wash their hands of Franceand thereby give any who would be ready to grasp at it the shameless pretextto claim that the Government was released from its understanding about the fleet,to which it was essential to hold them.37. I had seen Admiral Darlan a couple of hours earlier and had said afew words to him intended to provoke some personal assurance in regard to thefleet. He responded at once, saying : &quot; So long as I can issue orders to it, you have nothing to fear.&quot;38. Having asked for an armistice with Germany, Marshal Petain&apos;sGovernment took similar action in regard to Italy. They asked the Papal Nuncioto transmit to the Italian Government, through the Holy See, an intimation of theFrench Governments desire to seek the basis of a lasting peace. No mention wasmade of the cessation of hostilities. In informing me of this step, the Minister forForeign Affairs said that he had no doubt that the terms offered would be whollyunacceptable.39. At noon Marshal Petain broadcast to the French people. He stated thathe had assumed direction of the Government, and, after paying tribute to theFrench army, declared that he gave himself to France to help her in her hour ofmisfortune. &quot; It is with a heavy heart that I say we must cease to fight. I have applied to our opponent to ask him if he is ready to sign with us, as betweensoldiers after the fight, and in honour, a means to put an end to hostilities. Letall Frenchmen group themselves around the Government over which I presideduring this painful trial and affirm once more their faith in the destiny of our country.&quot;40. I established contact with Marshal Petain as soon as possible, andsaw him just before the meeting of the Council of Ministers. I told the marshalthat I had gladly received his solemn assurance that in no circumstances would the fleet be handed over, but that it was absolutely essential that, when the demandfor it was presented, it should be in British control and no longer in the power ofthe French Government to dispose of it. Otherwise, not only we but the FrenchGovernment itself would be in an intolerable situation. From our point of view it was the least we could expect. The marshal said that his own idea was thatthe fleet should be scuttled. I then spoke on the question of the ports, and saidthat they must not be simply handed over. The marshal said that, unfortunately,the situation was that the enemy would soon be able to take them whenever he wanted, but he would ensure that they were rendered unusable.41. I asked the marshal what his intentions were. If, as was to be presumed, the German conditions proved to be unacceptable, would the Govern-ment remove to North Africa ?   He said that he personally would stay, but he
supposed that a small Government might remove overseas. I said that it was absolutely vital that it should, as it was the best hope of ensuring that france would one day be restored.   I failed to elicit any satisfactory response.42. In reporting the above conversation, I stated that the marshal was verydispirited, that he was thinking mainly of the sufferings of the people, and that conversations with him were fruitless.43. In response to my appeal for the &quot;despatch of a man-of-war, theAdmiralty had sent H.M.S. Berkeley to Bordeaux, and FT.M.S. Arethusa toLe Verdon. Two passenger ships had also been sent to Le Verdon for theembarkation of British subjects and members of the Polish and Czech armieswhich it was desired to remove. Considerable numbers had already been dispatched to Le Verdon by train and by road, and I sent all the members ofmy staff with whose services I could dispense, the staff of the Ministry ofInformation, and the lady members of the Canadian and South African Legationsto Le Verdon in H.M.S. Berkeley. His Majesty&apos;s Embassies to Poland andBelgium embarked in H.M.S. Arethtisa on the same day, and Sir Howard Kennardbrought with him the President of the Polish Republic and his family, andselected members of the Polish Government and their families. I asked theofficer commanding H.M.S. Berkeley to return to Bordeaux as soon as she haddisembarked her passengers.44. I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs during the afternoon, whenhe informed me that the armistice terms had not yet been received. I stipulatedto him, as I stipulated to other Ministers, that His Majesty&apos;s Government mustbe consulted before any terms were accepted. I was, however, very doubtfulwhether we would obtain satisfaction. The new French Government, having already broken its engagement by violating the no-separate-peace agreement, was unlikely to hesitate at violating the obligation to consult His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment when the terms were received.45. The position - now was that, whereas M. Reynaud had set his faceagainst asking for armistice terms without being released by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment from the no-separate-peace engagement, the first act of marshal petain&apos;s Government was to ask for an armistice, thus breaking their word, asI made very clear to them. In every conversation I had with Ministers and public-personalities, I reverted in the terms contained in your telegrams Nos. 368 and369 (see paragraph 32 above) to the question of the fleet being placed in british control, but I never got any satisfaction beyond the reiterated assurance thatthe surrender of the fleet to Germany would in no circumstances be contemplated.I did not cease to urge sailing for a British port. My naval attache informed me that the fighting spirit of the French fleet was high. He had reason, however,to believe that the senior naval officers held the view that the men would refuse toabandon France, and become a part of the British navy, but he, also, continuedto receive assurances that the fleet would be scuttled rather than surrendered.46. In order to make absolutely certain that no member of the FrenchGovernment should be in any doubt as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment I asked the Secretary-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to seethat the contents of your telegrams Nos. 368 and 369 (see paragraph 32 above)were brought formally to the notice of the Council of Ministers in writing.47. During the day the telephone line to London was cut. The naval attache, who had now joined me with his staff, installed a portable wirelessset in the consulate, and it was possible to send messages through the Admiraltyby this means. Delays were, however, inevitable owing to jamming and telegramswere accordingly sent to you by the ordinary telegraph line to London and byNew York, the latter having been recommended to me as a quicker and morereliable route.48. The newspaper services in France had become completely disorganised,and few people in France knew what had been happening until they heardMarshal Petain&apos;s broadcast. Every attempt was made to jam French broadcastsfrom England, both, I was told, by the French as well as by the Germans. Theresult of all this was that public opinion was not only kept in ignorance, but was deprived of all means of expressing itself. There was thus no check onthe Government, which could do what it liked and inform the public afterwardsin carefully chosen terms.49. In the evening I went to see M. Chautemps, the Vice-President of theCouncil, who had led the movement in favour of ascertaining the terms on which[21475] c
an armistice would be granted on the ground that until they were proved to bedishonouring no French Government could leave the country in order to carryon the war from overseas. He assured me that his own resolution and that ofhis supporters to reject dishonouring conditions remained as strong as ever,but he added rather ominously that the present Government contained newelements whose opinions he could not guarantee beyond all manner of doubt. the surrender of the fleet would be considered the most dishonouring condition of all.50. I told M. Chautemps very forcibly that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentexpected to be consulted on the armistice conditions before any reply was sent,and also that the fleet should be sent forthwith to British waters. He admittedthe first point, but suggested that there might not be time. On the second pointI could extract no more than that the fleet would in no case be surrendered.M. Chautemps confirmed that the armistice conditions had not yet been received.The Minister for Foreign Affairs had given me a formal undertaking to informme at once when they came.Bordeaux, June 18.51. In the early hours of the morning I received your Lordship&apos;s tele-gram No. 397 instructing me to communicate the following personal message from the Prime Minister to Marshal Petain and General Weygand. I wasalso to communicate copies to the President of the Republic and admiral darlan :  &quot; I wish to repeat to you my profound conviction that the illustriousMarshal Petain and the famous General Weygarid, our comrades in two great wars against the Germans, will not injure their ally by deliveringover to the enemy the fine French fleet. Such an act would scarify their names for a thousand years of history. Yet this result may easily comeby frittering away these few precious hours when the fleet can be sailedto safety in British or American ports, carrying with it the hope of thefuture and the honour of France.&quot;General Weygand later spoke to me of this message in terms of great indigna-tion, saying that he did not admit that anyone should use such language to him.52. In your Lordship&apos;s telegrams Nos. 398 and 399, which I received earlythe same morning, you furnished me with additional arguments concerningthe disposal of the French fleet and the folly of accepting any terms which theGermans might offer. At the same time, you extended an invitation to theFrench Government to proceed to the United Kingdom.53. I duly delivered the Prime Ministers message to Marshal Petain, whoundertook to communicate it to General Weygand when he arrived, shortly beforethe Council of Ministers. The marshal said that I need have no misgivingswhatever. I replied that this did not satisfy me, and that the decision whichI had been constantly urging during the past days must be taken within the few hours that remained. I asked whether he realised that it was only by placing the fleet beyond the enemy&apos;s control that the French Government could avoid a situation which would be mortal for them and might well be mortal for GreatBritain. We were then joined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who saidthat the decision as regards the fleet had already been taken and only remained to be confirmed by the Council of Ministers that morning. He had no doubtthat this would be done, and was absolutely categorical on this point. As reported at the time, however, I could not feel entirely happy until I knew that the order had actually been given and was being carried out. In thesecircumstances, I decided to defer asking for an audience with the President ofthe Republic.54. At about 1 p.m. I learned that the above decision had not been ratified by the Council of Ministers, but had been replaced by an unanimous decision torefuse terms which included the surrender of the fleet.55. I was informed that the Council of Ministers had taken the attitude that it was a point of honour for France to receive the armistice terms with herarmies and fleet still fighting. An unanimous decision (engaging the honour of Marshal Petain, General Weygand and Admiral Darlan) was taken to theeffect that any terms whatever which included the surrender of the fleet wouldbe rejected, and that France would go on fighting (as she was still doing) for so long as she could. Before she capitulated on land the fleet would go tojoin up with the British navy, or, in the last resort, would carry out prearranged
orders to scuttle itself. I was assured that orders to that effect had been made out and would be issued immediately if this had not already been done. Therewould also be an order to disregard any order having the appearance of cancellingthe scuttling order, this being presumably to meet the case of a fresh order being issued by some subsequent Government.56. In reporting the above, I expressed my deep regret at the non-ratifica -tion of the decision of which I was informed earlier. I believed, however, atthat moment that the French were playing straight with us. Marshal Petain,General Weygand and Admiral Darlan were all men of honour, and I was assured that General Weygand would be given formal instructions to discussno armistice terms whatever if they included the surrender of the fleet. Thechange of mind since this morning was due, I thought, partly to Admiral Darlan&apos;sreluctance to part with his fleet while still fighting, and to a rather stiffer attitude on the part of the Government as a whole. To that extent it was a healthy sign.Moreover, I was told that French forces were still destroying tanks and killingGermans.57. The First Lord of the Admiralty and the First Sea Lord arrived inBordeaux in the late afternoon- After a conversation with Admiral Darlan,they reported that the French fleet would continue to fight until the terms of armistice were known. If these contained, as presumably they must, a sugges-tion. for the surrender of the fleet, the terms would be considered dishonourable,the armistice conference would be ended and fighting would be resumed. Itwould continue until this was no longer possible, when, before capitulation, theFrench fleet would be sailed to friendly ports, if practicable, or, in the last resort, destroyed. Certain active steps had already been taken, previous to the ports falling into enemy hands; ships in fighting trim would go to their war-stations, those under construction or repair but capable of steaming would goto Dakar, and the remainder would be destroyed. All merchant ships, especially those carrying war material, were being sailed for British ports as soon as theFrench ports were clear of magnetic mines. The destruction of oil supplies was covered by the general instructions -which had been issued, and the First Lordobtained Admiral Darlan&apos;s authority to send demolition parties to various ports on the understanding that they would report to the French Senior Naval officer on arrival and inform him that they were there with Admiral Darlan&apos;s consent.Admiral Darlan was very friendly and determined, and Mr. Alexander and admiral Sir Dudley Pound were impressed by his consistency andsincerity. Admiral Darlan was convinced that the French fleet would obeywhatever orders he gave. The First Sea Lord returned to England that nightby flying-boat.   The First Lord decided to remain until the following day.58. I reported by telegram that evening that the situation, as I then sawit, remained extremely confused. The rot, I said, had been originally started byGeneral Weygand, who informed the Government, each day in more pressingterms, that he could not hold the situation, and that, as France was militarilybeaten, it was useless to allow further carnage. Marshal Petain backed him up.M. Reynaud, faithful to the Anglo-French declaration, had stood out for fightingto the last and then removing the Government to carry on the war from overseas.He was gradually outnumbered and Marshal Petain, on assuming the presidency of the Council, replaced the firmer elements in M. Reynaud&apos;s Government byweaklings.59. I was unable to extract any clear indication of the French governments intentions, particularly as to removing to some French colonial possession. this might be because they did not themselves know, being much embarrassed by the declared intention of Marshal Petain and General Weygand to remain with theFrench people in France. Meanwhile, the sands were running out; the germans were steadily advancing and no reply to the request for an armistice had beenreceived. The French Government asserted with increasing decision that anydishonouring terms would be rejected, and that the French army would continueto fight until it could fight no more and was obliged to capitulate. At that moment, presumably, the Government would leave. There were indications, suchas the removal of material towards Africa, which seemed to show that that wasin their minds; but they still evaded any question that I put on that point. Inconveying this appreciation of the situation to your Lordship, I added that muchpolitical manoeuvring was going on, and that, except for Marshal Petain, whowould only talk of generalities (mostly about the suffering of the people), I hada feeling that I could not believe anyone implicitly.[21475] c 2
60. President Roosevelt, through Mr. Biddle, the United States ambassador to the Polish Government, who had been appointed Deputy Ambassador to theFrench Government as Mr. Bullitt had remained at Paris, continued to press the French Government to despatch the French fleet to ports out of reach of theenemy. That morning Mr. Biddle delivered to the French Government a very strong message from President Roosevelt to the effect that they would forfeitthe friendship and goodwill of the United States if they did not put the french fleet in a place of safety before the armistice. This communication only had theeffect of infuriating the French Government, who regarded it as intolerableinterference from a neutral country, especially as the United States Governmenthad failed to come up to the French Governments expectations.Bordeaux, June 19.61. Mr. Alexander and I saw Marshal Petain and the Minister for ForeignAffairs during the morning. They informed us that the Spanish ambassador had delivered a message shortly before to the effect that, if the French Govern-ment would nominate plenipotentiaries, the German Government would indicate the time and place of the meeting at which the armistice terms would be negotiated. The Council of Ministers had nominated the following delegation :General Huntziger (head); M. Noel, Ambassador of France; Admiral Leluc;General Parisot; General (Air) Bergeret. They would not be plenipotentiaries,and the authoritative decision would remain with the Government.62. We were also informed that the Council of Ministers had decided that,on the approach of the enemy to Bordeaux, the President of the Republic, the presidents of the Senate and of the Chamber of Deputies, and three or fourMinisters would proceed overseas to carry on the Government. The ministers would be nominated by the President of the Republic and would leavewith a written order from him, countersigned by Marshal Petain. general weygand would probably go, too, in order to co-ordinate the further French war effort.   The destination of the overseas Government would probably be Algiers.63. It was satisfactory that the decision, which I had been constantlyurging, to establish the Government overseas had at last been taken, and theFirst Lord and I applauded it on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, our conversation left us with a good impression. If words meant anything, therewas no weakening as regards the rejection of dishonouring terms.64. Lord Lloyd arrived in Bordeaux at about 5-30 p.m. The First Lordof the Admiralty, Lord Lloyd and I had an audience with the President of theRepublic the same evening, at which Lord Lloyd delivered the message fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government, saying that they charged him to convey to M. Lebrunthe great satisfaction with which they had learnt the unanimous decision of theFrench Government to accept no dishonouring terms. This satisfaction had beenaccentuated by the conversation which Mr. Alexander and Admiral Sir dudley pound had had the previous day (the 18th June) with Admiral Darlan, and againby the later news that it had been decided that the President of the Republic anda small Government would proceed overseas. This decision was a guarantee thatthe soul of France would continue to live and offered the surest hope of therestoration of France perhaps at no distant date. Lord Lloyd then made theoffer of shipping in order to help to get away personnel, material, &amp;c. ThePresident was obviously gratified by this message, but he was in a pitiablecondition and nothing definite emerged from the conversation.65. A little later Mr. Alexander, Lord Lloyd and I called on marshal petain, who was assisted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to whom Lord Lloydrepeated his message. When we came to the subject of the fleet, Marshal Petaingave the most categorical assurances that it would never be handed over toGermany, but said that it might have to be scuttled. M. Baudouin explained tome that, in the highly improbable event of the armistice terms proving acceptable,apart from the question of the fleet, the latter would be scuttled rather thanhanded over to us, whilst, in the contrary event, it would go on fighting. TheFirst Lord pressed the fleet question with the utmost vigour and with obviouseffect.66. When Lord Lloyd came to the question of the departure of the Govern -ment, Marshal Petain was indefinite. When we pressed the point, M. Baudouinsaid that the departure had been decided in principle and would be finally settled(including the time of departure) the following morning. When reminded thathe had said earlier in the day that the matter had been settled, M. Baudouin
replied that that was so in principle, but that it remained to be finally ratified the following morning. We all pressed the point with the utmost firmness and emphasised the danger of delay. M. Baudouin said that he hoped that the partymight be got off in the early afternoon.67. Lord Lloyd and I then called on the President of the Senate and thePresident of the Chamber, who were together, both of whom assured us that theyhad not ceased to work for the despatch of the Government overseas and showedus an admirable letter which they had addressed jointly to the President of theRepublic, pleading for the rejection of dishonouring terms, which they specifiedas follows : any condition which must result in the rupture of the alliance withGreat Britain; anything which could lower Prance in the esteem of friendlynations, particularly those which had made common cause with her; anything which would jeopardise French relations with the United States of America; andlast, but not least, the surrender of the French fleet. (M. Herriot subsequentlybegged me to treat my knowledge of this letter as most private and confidential.)They were both distressed at the delay which was occurring.68. In the course of our interview M. Jeanneney and M. Herriot begged usto have a small ship sent to Bayonne to convey to England a small number (theymentioned fifty) of officers who wished to place their services at the disposal ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, and of certain politicians who were marked men. Asit seemed possible that considerable numbers of French officers might wish to respond to the appeal which General de Gaulle had broadcast from London,I thought it well to ask that one or two ships should be sent to Bayonne in orderto embark them and any further persons or any material that it might be possibleto get away at the last moment.69. The First Lord of the Admiralty left for England at about 10 p.m.Lord Lloyd remained for the night.70. I would here make a digression to say that since our arrival in Bordeauxwe had been doing everything possible to secure the evacuation of British subjects,who were pouring into the town from all parts of France. In response to my request shipping was sent to Le Verdon, and considerable numbers of refugeeswere sent to England from there. Some were also evacuated in ships leavingBordeaux itself, but we had several disappointments, notably when the crews oftwo Dutch vessels in the harbour, which had promised to take passengers, wenton strike and the ships were unable to leave. German aeroplanes had been laying-magnetic mines regularly every night at the entrance to the Gironde, and h.M.S. Arethusa had had to have a channel swept for her by two mine-sweepers.In these circumstances the Admiralty had instructed the naval attache that theport of Bordeaux was to be cleared of shipping. British subjects were nowarriving in Bordeaux only in driblets, but the vice-consul at Bayonne reportedthat a number had assembled there. I accordingly felt that shipping should be diverted to Bayonne and that it was no longer necessary to keep the consular staffin Bordeaux. Mr. Dible, with the members of the consulate and of the navalcontrol office, together with Lieutenant-Colonel Redman and the remainder of theWar Cabinet Secretariat, Lieutenant-Colonel de Chair and other members ofNo. 1 Mission and the staff of the Canadian and South African Legations, leftBordeaux that afternoon. The naval attache and the military attache detailedmembers of their staffs to proceed to Bayonne in order to superintend theevacuation from there, not only of British subjects but also of the remnants ofthe Polish and Czech armies and of any foreign political personalities whom itwas desirable to remove. His Majesty&apos;s Consul handed over the consulatebuilding to his American colleague, but I was able to arrange with Mr. Biddlethat the strict formalities should be waived and that I and my staff could occupy the offices as long as we wished. This was essential as the wireless transmitterand receiver was installed there, and also because I considered it necessary thatsome official should be permanently there in order to help and direct to the port of embarkation such British subjects as continued to trickle in. In this task themilitary and naval and air attaches and their staffs also co-operated, and theFrench authorities were very helpful in providing train accommodation andlorries to take the parties of British subjects which were collected to Bayonne.Bordeaux, June 20.71. Shortly after midnight Bordeaux was bombed by German aircraft, andLord Lloyd and I drafted the account of our conversation with M. Jeanneney and
M. Herriot by the light of one guttering candle to the accompaniment of whistlingbombs and machine-gun fire. The object of the raid seems to have been mainly to terrify the French Government. Bombs were dropped more or lessindiscriminately, and one fell very close to the Presidency of the Council. ships in the harbour were machine-gunned. Several houses were destroyed, and casualties amounted to about fifteen killed and about fifteen wounded. The raidlasted for over an hour and some German machines returned after daylight,presumably in order to photograph the result. No bombs were dropped on this occasion.72. The chief effect of the air raid was to decide the Government to move toPerpignan during the afternoon in order that it might be able to consider thearmistice conditions in the requisite calm. The President of the Republic, the presidents of the Senate and of the Chamber and a nucleus Government wouldthereafter leave, I was assured, for North Africa from Port Vendres.73. During the morning Lord Lloyd and I saw Admiral Darlan, who showedus written instructions in regard to the fleet, which were broadly as follows : inthe event of the Admiral-Commanding-in-chief being no longer able to exercisecommand, the fleet would take orders from Admiral Esteva or, in default of him,Admiral Abrial. It was to go on fighting fiercely unless it received orders to thecontrary from a properly constituted Government outside enemy control.74. Shortly after midday I learnt that the French representatives would meet the Germans for the receipt of armistice terms that night at Tours. TheMinister for Foreign Affairs that morning again gave me a positive assurance thatin no case would the fleet be surrendered.75. I made arrangements for myself and a further reduced staff to move to Perpignan that evening, and for the remainder of my staff to return to England.I would be accompanied to Perpignan by the Canadian and South AfricanMinisters. I asked your Lordship whether one of His Majesty&apos;s ships, or, if this were difficult for the Admiralty to arrange, a flying-boat or boats, could be sentto Port Vendres to convey us to North Africa.76. Abut 5-30 p.m. I learnt that a last-minute change of plan had beenmade. The Germans having offered to reinstate the telephone line with Tours,the Government decided to remain in Bordeaux to receive the armistice terms,which they expected during the evening. In these circumstances I asked that.M.S. Galatea, which had replaced H.M.S. Arethusa, should remain off Arcachonuntil further notice.Bordeaux, June 21.77. At 12-15 a.m. the armistice conditions had not yet been received, andall that was known was that fighting had ceased in the Tours area in order to let the French delegation through. I subsequently learnt that the french delegation had been delayed by the destruction of a bridge and only arrived atTours at 4 a.m.78. At about 6 a.m. I sent my military attache to find M. Baudouin andhand him the following written communication from me, dated the 20th June :&apos;&apos; I think it my duty to remind you that my Government expected to be consulted as soon as any armistice terms were received.&quot; In reporting this action to your lordship, I stated that the German conditions would probably, however, besubject to a short-time limit and that it must be anticipated that no effectiveconsultation, if any at all, would be feasible. The German armies had paused,but, when they moved again, armoured and motorised columns could reachBordeaux in a very short time. There was nothing to stop them. Apart fromthe question of the fleet, which I believed to have been safeguarded by the instruc-tions issued on the 20th June, I proposed to insist on the despatch of a nucleusGovernment overseas, this step being, as I had told the French Ministers overand over again, the only thing which would encourage His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto stand by France to the end.79. In reply to my written communication mentioned above, I received anote from the Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that he did not think itnecessary to inform me afresh that it had always been the intention of the FrenchGovernment to have an exchange of views with His Majesty&apos;s Government as soonas the armistice conditions were known. M. Baudouin added that, according tohis latest information, he did not expect to receive the armistice conditions until
later that evening. It was satisfactory to have obtained this acknowledgment, butit did not alter the fact that, if a very short time-limit was set, no effectiveconsultation would be possible.80. When the French Government decided to move to Perpignan thePresident of the Chamber secured a ship in Bordeaux and put on board a numberof parliamentarians for shipment overseas. They were now hung up somewherein the mouth of the Gironde. Unfortunately, they were those, of course, whostood for resistance. The weaker politicians were still in Bordeaux, and M. Lavaland his friends were active. M. Herriot told me that there was still a majority in the Cabinet among the civilians in favour of resistance, but it was significant that there was no longer unanimity. I feared that the majority might dwindleyet further. The decision to move to Perpignan having been cancelled, it seemedall too likely that the next step might be a decision to abandon entirely the ideaof sending the President of the Republic and a nucleus Government overseas.The situation, in fact, was changing from hour to hour, and I could not believeanything I was told except by Marshal Petain, who was evasive or silent aboutthe things I wanted to know, and by the Presidents of the two Houses, who werenot kept informed by the Government.81. At 2-30 p.m. I learned that the French armistice delegation had been compelled to proceed to Paris. (They subsequently had to proceed from Paris toCompiegne and to receive the armistice conditions from Herr Hitler in the samerailway carriage in which the German armistice delegation had been received in November 1918.) The French delegation would demand that the FrenchGovernment be allowed to examine the conditions in peace, i.e., free from aerial bombardment. The same message was sent to the Spanish Ambassador, accom-panied by the hint that otherwise the French Government might have to moveelsewhere.82. Bad signs were now multiplying. An order instructing colonial governors to carry on independently, although under discussion, had not yet been signed. The French censor was suppressing all news messages favourable to theAllied cause, such as the admission of Republican representatives into the UnitedStates Government, increased supplies of war material by the United states to Great Britain, the success of the Royal Air Force in Italian East Africa.General Nogues&apos;s address to the people of Morocco, &amp;c. The situation was clearly not improving. I continued to encourage M. Herriot to stimulate the forces of resistance, but in existing conditions his capacity in that direction was limited.In the meantime, an armoured division was reported to have passed Valence onthe way to Marseilles with the obvious intention of cutting off the retreat of theFrench Government to Perpignan.83. At 4 p.m. I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs again. He said thathe had as yet heard nothing from the French delegation, and did not expect toreceive the armistice conditions until late that night at the earliest. He assuredme that the Governments intentions were unchanged; but it was clear to methat, even if that were true at the moment, evil influences were at work.M. Baudouin was quite categorical that the intention was still to send thePresident and a small Government overseas, and he told me that Admiral Darlanhad been instructed to provide a warship at Saint-Jean-de-Luz.84. Immediately after this conversation I saw M. Chautemps, whose ideaswere still sound, both as regards the rejection of dishonouring or severe terms and the despatch of a Government overseas. He confirmed the intrigues andkaleidoscopic character of the situation. A lamentable influence, he said, was general Weygand&apos;s mystic mood, which led him to believe that France, having made mistakes, deserved to suffer. I worked on M. Chautemps for half an hourand thought I had succeeded in putting fresh heart into him. During my stay in Bordeaux I refrained from seeing M. Reynaud, as I felt that to do so wouldcompromise him in present circumstances. M. Reynaud was, however, seeingMarshal Petain once or twice a day and was doing his best to stiffen him.Bordeaux, June 22.85. I was informed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs about midnight by telephone that the armistice conditions had been received by telephone and wouldbe considered by the Council of Ministers at 1 a.m., after which the Minister forForeign Affairs would receive me. I went at once to the Presidency of theCouncil, where the Secretary-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs told me
broadly the main conditions. On hearing the condition about the fleet (article 8)I hastily wrote a note calling attention to its insidious character and the follyof placing any reliance on the German word so many times broken, and demandedthat the note should be taken into the council, which by that time was sitting atthe Presidency of the Republic nearby, whither I then went, accompanied by theCanadian and South African Ministers, whom I had asked to join me there. Wesat in a darkened hall, where people talked in whispers and gloomy officers flittedbackwards and forwards until about 3 a.m., when, on the termination of the ministerial Council, I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as he came out,to inform me of the nature of the conditions and of the result of the council&apos;sdeliberations. He said that he was going away to draft the reply which had toreach the Germans by 9 a.m., and that he had not time to speak to me. I saidthat I and the Dominion Ministers must be received and informed of theconditions and of the reply which it was proposed to send. M. Badouin repliedthat what interested us was the condition about the fleet, of which he gave usa hasty outline, adding that, on the suggestion of Admiral Darlan, it had beendecided to make a counter-proposal by which the fleet would be sent to french north African ports, where it would be dismantled. I said that it ought to besent further away. If sent to a Mediterranean port, it would risk falling intoItalian hands. M. Baudouin said that, in that case, it would be scuttled inaccordance with the decision already taken. He then moved away, saying, in response to my demand, that he had not got a spare copy of the Germanconditions. On my continuing to insist, he eventually gave me one. I then saidthat I must protest formally against this procedure and insisted on being receivedsomewhere where we could&apos; talk quietly. With bad grace M. Baudouin showedus into the council room, where we found the President of the Republic. much the same scene occurred and I renewed my protest in the presence of the President,who merely made some irrelevant remark. It proved impossible further to detainM. Baudouin, whose attitude throughout was, to say the least, discourteous.When I reminded him of the letter which he had written me that very morningadmitting the intention of the French Government to consult His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on receipt of the armistice conditions, he confined himself to sayingthat the French reply would not be definitive, but would &quot; put Questions.&quot; when finally said that I must formally insist on being received before the draft replyto the German terms was submitted to the Council of Ministers, he agreed withbad grace to see me at 8 a.m.86. This shameful scene, witnessed by Ministers and their secretaries whowere standing round, sufficed to show me that the French had completely lost their heads and would thenceforward be unmanageable. The French text of thearmistice terms and the summary which I at once telegraphed to your Lordshipform Enclosures 3 and 4 to this despatch. I will here confine myself to thequestion of the disposal of the French fleet.87. - Article 8 of the armistice terms required that the French fleet, exceptthat part left free for the safeguard of French interests in the colonial empire,should be collected in ports to be specified, where it would be demobilised anddisarmed under German or Italian control. Normal peace-time base ports wouldbe taken for the purposes of this specification. The German Governmentsolemnly declared that it had no intention of using during the war for its own purposes the French fleet stationed in ports under German control, except thoseunits necessary for coast surveillance and mine-sweeping. The German Govern-ment further declared that it had no intention of making claims in respect of theFrench fleet at the time of negotiations of the peace terms. Except for that part(to be determined) of the fleet destined for the protction of colonial interests, al!ships outside French territorial waters must be recalled to France.88.   I sent the following first appreciation to your Lordship :  Diabolically clever German terms have evidently destroyed the lastremnants of French courage. If, as I presume is certain, the Germans reject the French counter-proposals as regards the fleet under threat of continuing their advance, I do not believe for a moment that the French, in their present-state of collapse, will hold out against the original German condition to recallthe fleet to French ports, and might even reverse the scuttling order. Theycould still square their conscience by saying that the ships could not be used against us. We are then thrown back on Admiral Darlan&apos;s assurance to theFirst Lord.  I will get into touch with him as soon as possible.&quot;
89. Having drafted telegrams reporting the above events, I left my hotel at-45 a.m. I insisted on seeing Marshal Petain, which I did with great difficultyin the company of the Minister for Foreign Affairs before they entered the ministerial Council to consider the draft of the French reply.90. I said that at an hour when France had laid down her arms and herally was about to be plunged into a life and death struggle, I came to themarshal, whose name throughout the world was synonymous with honour, tobeg him on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to see to it that France kept thesolemn engagement binding the honour of France, and renewed more than once in recent days, not to allow the fleet to fall into German hands, and thus strike a mortal blow at an ally who had always been loyal and with whom France had had a no-separate-peace engagement. If France was no longer in a position tohold to that obligation, she could hold to the one to which I was referring. to recall the fleet to French ports to be disarmed under German control was equivalent, as my hearers must realise, to surrender.91. At this point the marshal interrupted me to say that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment need have no qualms as I had already been informed many times.The French Government hoped to get the fleet away to African ports, such asDakar and Madagascar. It would sink itself if ever in danger of falling intoenemy hands.92. The interview took place whilst Ministers, standing round, were waiting to go into the council. At the point I had reached the marshal indicated that hecould not keep his Ministers waiting any longer.93. I was unable to explain the discrepancy between the statement madeto me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at 4 a.m. as to the fleet being sent toMediterranean ports, and the statement which had just been made to me bythe marshal. It might conceivably be the result of what I said to M. Baudouinas to the danger of sending it to be disarmed in Mediterranean ports underItalian supervision or, more probably, to confusion. At the previous council,Ministers may have talked merely of African ports. They were, in fact,distraught, except the marshal, who was becoming increasingly difficult to approach (notwithstanding my utmost insistence) and more and more silent.I was being kept now at arm&apos;s length and was becoming the object of hostile looksfrom the rank and file of Ministers.94. The French reply contained a request for other modifications, such,for instance, as the reduction of the occupied area. The text of the reply isenclosed as Annex 5 to this despatch.95. While the above interview was taking place, the naval attache on my instructions was seeing Admiral Auphan, the Naval Chief of Staff, who assuredhim again that no unit of the French fleet would be handed over to the Germans.He said that the French Government hoped to arrange for the internment ofthe fleet away from French metropolitan ports, and mentioned Dakar, FrenchCongo and Madagascar as possible places. Admiral Auphan stated categoricallythat the ships would remain under the French flag and with orders that shouldthe Germans or Italians attempt to interfere with them in any way or at any timetheir crews would sink them at once.96.   The fleet clause in the French reply ran as follows : &quot; The French fleet (with the exception of that part which is left at thedisposal of the French Government in order to safeguard French interestsin the Colonial Empire), after having been demobilised and havingdisembarked ammunition under German or Italian control, will be based on french-African ports. The crews of each ship shall not exceed half thenormal peace-time crew.&quot;The remainder of the article to remain unchanged.97. This was wholly unsatisfactory and was, indeed, little if any betterthan the German version. As soon as I had secured the text I forced my wayinto the house of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and demanded to be received at once. I argued that once in German hands for the purpose of control, noship would be allowed to leave German hands. The Minister for Foreign Affairsargued that in the case of ships absent from their base ports (the very large majority) the Germans would be invited to send control commissions. As regardsthe others (if any) the scuttling order would be carried out if there was anyattempt to remove or otherwise interfere with French crews.[21475] d
98. I said vehemently and at length that all this was totally unsatisfactory and would, as he must realise, lead to a breach of faith by France. The Ministerfor Foreign Affairs continued to argue that the key of the whole situation wasthe scuttling order, and he offered to instruct Admiral Darlan to tell me exactlyhow this would work out in practice.99. I had little remaining doubt that we were confronted with deliberatebad faith. I could only pray that we could still rely on Admiral Darlan whom intended to see at the first possible moment. There was an organised conspiracyto keep me from ascertaining the facts. I was doing everything I possibly could,but the scales were weighted against me from the moment the Germans set ashort-time limit. There was growing Anglophobia among the ministers andparliamentarians, the result of clever and successful Fifth Column work. I hadto deal mainly with M. Baudouin, who had become the leading spirit in theGovernment, but in whose word I no longer had any faith, and an old man whoseemed incapable of grasping the situation, but whose word of honour,nevertheless, remained our only hope. The reply of the French Government, whowere given a short extension of time (the Germans had originally demanded toreceive their reply by 9 am.) was sent off and discussions were resumed atCompiegne.100.   At 4 p.m. I reported to your Lordship as follows :  &apos;&apos; You should know that the situation, after rising and falling for somedays, has become (I think for good) about as bad as it could be. There isno fight left in anyone, and French soldiers back from the front are sellingtheir arms in Bordeaux.&quot;At 6 p.m. I reported that I had been unable to get a straight answer, butthat I took it that in the altered circumstances (now approaching a land-slide)there was no longer any question of setting up a Government overseas.101. I continued my efforts with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It wasin vain that I pointed out to him that after our exchange of letters aboutconsultation, he was under an obligation to keep me promptly and fully informed of each stage and step. M. Baudouin merely replied that he was doing so. Hewas becoming ever more elusive and more evasive.102. At about 6 p.m. &apos; I was informed by the Secretary-General of theMinistry for Foreign Affairs of the German reply. The French counter-proposals(some of which were rejected and some partially accepted) had been embodied in a document which was to be annexed to the Armistice Convention, and wouldbe taken into account when the time came to conclude the treaty of peace. Thefleet clause ran as follows :  &quot;The proposed modification is not accepted for insertion in the con-vention. The Germans do not refuse to contemplate acceptance of theproposal made, but they consider that it is a measure of application falling within the competence of the Armistice Commission.&quot;The German comments on.the other points raised by the French are containedin my telegram No. 528, a copy of which forms Annex 6 to this despatch.103/ When handing me, in confidence, the text of the German reply, whichI had to copy hastily myself, M. Charles-Roux stated that he was authorisedto make to me secretly the following statement, which I took down in writing:  &apos;&apos; The dispositions taken by Admiral Darlan are such that no ship wouldbe utilisable were an attempt to use it to be made.&quot;The Secretary-General said that this should give us complete satisfaction. Inaturally repudiated this with contumely, and said that this lamentable clausemight well make just the difference to us between victory and defeat, and, there-fore, jeopardise also all hope of a future for France: I could not express myprofound regret that the Anglo-French Alliance, on which such confident hopeshad been founded, should have dissolved in such circumstances.104. At the close of this interview I told M. Charles-Roux that it was my intention, as soon as the armistice had been signed, to leave with my staff for england. He affected surprise and asked me for my reasons. I replied thatI had been accredited to a free and Allied Government, and did not thinkthat my Sovereign and Government would wish me to stay with a French Govern-ment which within a few hours would be under the control of the enemy with
which the British Commonwealth of Nations was still, and would remain, .at war. Apart from that consideration, it would be quite useless.for me to remain,as, even if I and my staff were not removed to Berlin, as had happened toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels, it was futile to suppose that communica-tion of any kind would be allowed between the French Government and myself;we should both of us be in a ridiculous and impossible position. As I could beof no further use it was my duty, in any case, to return home for report and consultation, after which His Majesty&apos;s Government would no doubt review-the situation in the light, of further developments. I thought it well to add that rider in order not to give the impression that His Majesty&apos;s government might abandon France altogether, and thereby ,encourage the French Govern-inent to consider themselves released from any further obligation, notably theundertaking to scuttle the- fleet rather than allow it to be used against us.105. Later in the evening I went, accompanied by the two dominion ministers, to call on General Weygand, who. informed us that the armistiee hadbeen signed about an hour previously. I thereupon spoke to the general in much the same language as that which I had used with M. Charles-Roux. He, too,seemed surprised at first by my decision, but afterwards appeared to realise the force of my arguments. The general remarked at one point in our con-versation that, although the Germans seemed to have paused in their advance on Bordeaux from the north, they might well be there next day if they decidedto push, on.   There was nothing to stop them.106. An hour or so later (it was then about 10 p.m.) I called &quot;on theMinister for Foreign Affairs with the same object in view. He had retired tobed and came down to receive me with apologies in his dressing-gown. He,likewise, affected surprise on learning of my imminent departure, but acceptedit when I had put my case. I asked if I could see Marshal Petain, but . Baudouin said that he had gone to bed and must on no account be disturbed,and that he himself would be responsible for delivering my message.107. In the course of the evening I also went to see if I could have anaudience of the President of the Republic^ I was received by the head of the civilian household, who told me that the -President was in bed. I said thatin that case it seemed unnecessary for me to disturb him, as I had not come toask for a farewell audience. After I had explained the situation to him, M. Magreagreed, and said that he would deliver a suitable message to the President inthe morning on my behalf. By arrangement with me the two Dominion Ministersalso called immediately after me both on the Minister for Foreign Affairs andat the Presidency of the Republic.108. I can only offer two explanations of the surprise evinced at all theseinterviews by my decision to leave. The first is that my interlocutors had sodeluded themselves into believing that a French Government would be allowedto function freely that they honestly thought that I could render further service.The other, much more likely, is that the French Government hoped by detainingme to give the French public and outside world the impression that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had condoned their actions. It was not possible for me to seekand receive your instructions in time, but I felt reasonably sure that you wouldnot wish me in all the circumstances to give the French Government that satis-faction. They had violated the no-separate-peace engagement; they had brokentheir word, recently renewed in writing, to consult His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton receipt of the German terms; they were meeting my representations withevasions and were treating me personally with discourtesy; and they were onthe point of falling under enemy control. In these circumstances it was clearthat I could render no further service, and I trust that my decision to evacuateHis Majesty&apos;s Embassy when I did will be approved. Once I had decidedto do so, I accelerated the final preparations as I had been told that the officercommanding H.M.S. Galatea was anxious to leave at the earliest possible moment for the reason that at least one enemy submarine was known to be operating in theneighbourhood.109. We accordingly left towards midnight for Arcachon, embarked earlythe following morning in a sardine boat, from which after reaching the opensea we transferred to the Canadian destroyer Fraser, which conveyed us toSaint Jean-de-Luz where we transhipped to H.M.S. Galatea.110. The steamship Ettrick Castle was off Saint Jean-de-Luz and hadalready taken on board a large number of British subjects and members of the[21475] d 2
Anglo-French Ambulance Corps, the Spears-Hadfield Ambulance and the motor transport Service, and was engaged in embarking Polish and Czech troops.Other shipping was also available. Naval officers, assisted by Major Withing-ton, my assistant military attache, remained on shore to superintend theembarkation.111. I omitted to mention that your Lordship&apos;s telegram No. 458, withits renewed intimation that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to make every possible effort to assist France to continue the struggle, whether in Franceitself or. in French overseas territories, did not reach me until several hoursafter the armistice had been signed.112. It was not until just before H.M.S. Galatea was due to sail that I received your further telegram instructing me to deliver to President Lebruna message from His Majesty in the following terms:  &apos;&apos; I learn with deep anxiety and dismay that your Government, underthe cruel pressure of these tragic days, contemplate sending the french fleet to French North African ports, where it would be dismantled. this must, in effect, leave the French fleet where it would be in evident dangerof falling into hostile hands.&quot; I need not remind you, M. le President, should this occur, how greatwould be the danger involved to our common cause, and I rely on the solemnand explicit word of France, already given to my Government, that in no circumstances would your Government assent to any condition that involvedthis consequence.&quot;113. As I had no further means of delivering this message personally Idecided to forward it to its destination by telegraph from Saint Jean-de-Luz.114. After the admiral had transferred his flag to H.M.S. Calcutta, H.M.S.Galatea sailed at midnight and reached Plymouth at 8-30 p.m. the following-evening. The kindness and hospitality which we received at the hands of AdmiralCurtis, Captain Schofield, the officer commanding the Eraser and their sub-ordinate officers was beyond all words, and I should be very glad if an expression of our grateful appreciation could be conveyed to them.115. On arrival at Plymouth I found that the Admiral Commanding-in-Chief had most kindly sent his barge to convey me to Admiralty House, whitherI accordingly proceeded, accompanied by His Majesty&apos;s Minister and the twoDominion Ministers, and where we were recipients of very gracious hospitalityat the hands of Sir Martin and Lady Dunbar-Nasmith. Admirable arrange-ments had also been made for the remaining members of the party.116. During the run to Plymouth in H.M.S. Galatea I received your lordship &apos;s kind telegram running as follows : &apos;&quot; Please accept the grateful thanks of my colleagues and myself for your unremitting labours in the Allied cause performed towards the end in conditions of danger, discomfort and acute personal embarrassment. Yourwork and that of your staff has been beyond praise.&quot;117. I need not tell you with what profound gratitude I and every memberof my staff received this kind and comforting message.118. On reading through the above recital I find there is not very much that I need add unless it be an attempt to explain, in so far as I am able to doso, how the sorry tale which it unfolds can have come to pass. It is, perhaps,inevitable that in the process I shall be found to have fallen here and there intothe error of repetition.119. As I reported at the time, the French nation, which had been led tobelieve that it was secure behind the Maginot line, was completely paralysedby the news that this bastion had been turned and that German armies werepouring through a breach made in the Allied defences in the neighbourhood ofSedan. From that moment the spectre of defeat was never absent from the visionof every Frenchman who knew the true situation. General Wej^gand, who, whenthe Prime Minister and officers of the Imperial General Staff talked with him at Vincennes the day after he had assumed the supreme command, had inspiredconfidence in his ability to redress the situation, if anyone could, quickly gaveway to despair. From the day when he formally intimated that, if the Frencharmies failed on the Somme-Aisne line to hold up the enemy&apos;s advance, no furtherorganised resistance would be possible, the French Government ceased to have
any real heart in the fight. Marshal Petain, whom M. Reynaud brought into theGovernment in order to cover its responsibility, exercised from the first a defeatistinfluence which rapidly infected his colleagues.120. It was in this mood, aggravated by the remorseless German advancewhich a brief and fragmentary return of spirit among the French troops failed to check, that the Government started on its flight across France, which ended atBordeaux in a complete surrender to the German conditions.121. During the three days spent in the Touraine M. Reynaud, who, upto the time of the departure from Paris, had seemed to dominate his colleagues,began to lose ground. This was clearly demonstrated by his compliance withthe demand, made by the majority of his colleagues, that he should put forward a plea to the British Ministers during their visit to Tours to release France from her engagement not to sue separately for armistice terms or conclude a separate peace. By the time we reached Bordeaux M. Reynaud, who continued to assertthat he would be no party to the breach of an agreement to which he hadsubscribed, was warning me that, unless the miracle of an American declarationof war supervened, it was only a matter of a day or so before he was overwhelmedby the growing majority in his Government, which favoured asking the enemy on what conditions an armistice would be granted. The argument used by thisfaction, as stated in the earlier part of this report, was that no French Govern-ment, or even individual politician, could leave France, without appearing to befleeing in order to save his own skin, until the conditions had been ascertainedand shown to be unacceptable. It was only then that the people would understand the necessity for continued resistance and the despatch of a Government to carryon overseas. There was no doubt something in this argument, but I never feltthat it was wholly sincere. In the light of after events I am inclined to thinkit was not, although I was assured on two occasions that Admiral Darlan had actually been instructed to hold the necessary transport in readiness.122. When, late in the evening of our second day in Bordeaux, M. Reynaudwas forced to resign after failing to get a majority in favour of accepting theoffer of His Majesty&apos;s Government of complete fusion of the two countries forthe purpose of pursuing the war to victory, he was followed into the wildernessby the few stout hearts who had supported him, notably M. Man del, M. Campinchiand M. Dautry. The new Government formed by Marshal Petain waspredominantly defeatist. I was assured on more than one occasion that it hadregistered a unanimous decision to accept no dishonouring or humiliating terms,but it is a question whether it was not merely going through certain motionsdesigned to salve its own conscience and to tranquillise His Majesty&apos;s Government.123. Be that as it may, my task from this moment became infinitely mofearduous. M. Reynaud had always made what I believed to be a sincere attemptto keep me adequately informed. M. Baudouin, who replaced him as Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, either withheld information or gave it belatedly. Myinterviews with him were brief and wholly unsatisfactory. They consisted, onhis side, mainly in the repetition, in a manner which failed to convince, of the assurance that no dishonouring terms would be accepted, and that in no eventwould the fleet be surrendered or allowed to fall intact into German hands. Myinterviews with Marshal Petain were even more disappointing. He seemed quiteunable to grasp the necessity either of not succumbing so long as any resistance,however feeble, could be offered, or of sending a Government overseas to keepthe flag flying. He was entirely absorbed with one thought, and one only thatof putting an end to further bloodshed and of remaining himself in France inthe hope of mitigating the sufferings of the people under German occupation.On one occasion, after admitting that there was a question of sending a Govern-ment overseas, he added that, if the British navy torpedoed their ship on theway, he personally would have no regrets. Nor was anything to be gained bytalking to the President of the Republic. He was in a state bordering on collapseand could only talk of the sufferings of the people, which he described as greaterthan any known in the history of the world.124. During all this time I never ceased to employ and to develop thearguments with which you furnished me. I said that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere entitled to expect from the great French nation a line of conduct at least as stiff as that followed by those of our smaller and weaker Allies who, even after they had been overwhelmed, had not caved in. I insisted that it was a fallacyto suppose that any leniency of treatment could be bought at the price of
premature surrender; that, even if the German conditions appeared not. to be unduly harsh, the jackboot would be donned as soon as it suited the Germanleaders to employ the methods which they had applied to other peoples lured intosubmission. If my hearers (many of whom agreed with me) thought that by giving in they could alleviate the future sufferings of the people, no greatermistake could be made. I harped constantly on the no-separate-peace engagement,designed to meet just the circumstance which had arisen; and I emphasised thatit was only by holding out, or at least by fulfilling the condition stipulated byHis Majesty&apos;s Government (the despatch of the fleet to British ports), that GreatBritain would be encouraged to stand by France to the bitter end. In the later stages, when it had become clear that the Government was bent on surrender,my efforts were mainly devoted to urging some course which would ensure thatthe French fleet could never in any circumstances be used against us, and toinsisting that the only hope of any future for France lay in the setting up of; a french Government overseas to preserve the colonial empire and to keep alivethe flame of French nationalism.125. As I have already shown, these and other arguments were of no availagainst the mood of abject surrender which daily gained in strength afterM. Reynaud&apos;s retirement from the stage. The only two political personalitieswhose attitude throughout was sound, and who never faltered were M. Jeanneney,the aged President of the Senate, and M. Herriot, President of the Chamber.I saw them many times, both separately and together, and urged them not toslacken in their efforts to rally the forces of resistance. But their situation was difficult for the reason, deliberate no doubt, that they were kept in almost completeignorance of what was going on. They eagerly welcomed the enlightenmentwhich I was able to give them.126. In the final stages, dating from the decision to apply for the conditionsof armistice, I was no longer kept properly informed and every device was employed to evade or delay my visits. I was driven to the undignified expedientof waiting about in darkened halls, thronged with little groups of whisperingsecretaries and aides-de-camp, in the hope of forcing an interview either withthe marshal or with M. Baudouin as they went into or came out from a meetingof Ministers. It was only by violent insistence that I succeeded in obtainingcopies of the German terms, of the French counter-suggestions and of the finalGerman reply.127. Up to the last every French Minister whom I saw, from Marshal Petaindownwards, continued to assure me in the most categorical terms that HisMajesty&apos;s Government need have no anxiety in regard to the fleet, which inthe last resort would be scuttled. It was in vain that I argued that the Germans,who knew something about scuttling, would contrive by one means or anotherto prevent it. This was so obvious that I was forced to believe that these assurances, whose very reiteration tended to shake my confidence, were theexpression of a pious hope rather than a sacred pledge. I ceased at last to havefaith in anything but the word of honour of Admiral Darlan, to whom as asailor it would be repugnant to hand over his ships in fighting condition to theenemy, and who continually repeated that the necessary orders had been given and seemed convinced that they could and would be carried out. But at thevery end I began to have doubts even of the admiraFs good faith. It had beena very clever move (prompted, I suspect, by M. Baudouin) to bring him into theGovernment as Minister of Marine. From that moment he had a double capacity that of a member of the Government and that of commander-in-chief of theFrench naval forces. In the former capacity he subscribed to the Germanarmistice conditions, and he was morally bound to ensure that they were carriedout. Although I felt there was some risk in showing doubt of his word bycontinually pressing him to repeat it. I thought you might none the less wishme to have a final interview with him. Accordingly, during the afternoon ofour last day in Bordeaux I sent my naval attache to ask when he could receive me.The answer was that he was too busy to do so, but that I need have no anxiety.This obvious prevarication could be interpreted in two ways. It did not, however,increase my confidence; and I finally came away with the feeling that it wouldbe inadvisable to rely implicitly on Admiral Darlan doing the right thing.128, Coming now to the crux of the matter, the reason of the Frenchcollapse, I find myself unable to give a simple answer. It seems incredible thatthe great French army should have crumpled up in the way that it did.   At the
outbreak of war I am convinced that the spirit was&quot; excellent. By the end ofthe, year men coming home on leave from the front were beginning to say that,whilst they had been ready to die for their country, they were not ready to sitabout doing nothing indefinitely. As the months went by German propaganda,cleverly and insidiously conducted, played further havoc with the morale of thetroops. The assurances which General Gamelin was fond of addressing to themto the effect that in this war, unlike the last, everything possible would be done to avoid unnecessary sacrifice of life were also not conducive to maintaining a fighting spirit. Lastly, it may well be that the presence in every battalion ofa certain number of Communists played a certain part. In spite, nevertheless,of these adverse factors, I am disposed to think that, if the French army had only had some initial success, it might have lived up to its traditional reputation.As it was, it never fought anything but rearguard actions (always discouragingto the best of troops), and from the first the men felt there was nothing to be doneagainst the shock tactics, the superior numbers and the seemingly inexhaustiblewealth of material against which they were pitted. These disadvantages wereaccentuated by the practical (as opposed to theoretical) incompetence of general gamelin in the earlier stages, and later by the half-hearted conduct of operations by General Weygand, who, from the moment he had sized up thesituation, seems to have made up his mind that it was hopeless. To make mattersworse, the hordes of panic-stricken civilian refugees which it was part of theGerman tactics to drive before them, not only had a shattering effect on theFrench troops, but seriously interfered with their operations. I cannot insist too strongly on this point, for it played a big part, and there is, moreover, a lessonto be learnt from it.129. The fact, then, was that even before Paris had been evacuated theFrench army was beaten. What of the politicians? In fairness, it must beadmitted that, in the face of the continued insistence of Marshal Petain andGeneral Wej^gand that further resistance was useless and would only involveunnecessary suffering, none but a really strong leader could have kept thesituation in hand. There was no one to fill the part. The evolution of Frenchpolitics, making for the multiplicity of small parties placing their parochial and individual political aims before the welfare of the State, had militated againstthe emergence of a leader. M. Reynaud was the nearest approach to one, but hewas far from being man enough to contend with the Herculean task which fell to him and which he had coveted. M. Mandel, the disciple of Clemenceau, mighthave risen to the necessary height had he not been put out of court by his Jewishblood and the fact that he had neither party nor following in the country.M. Dautry, who at one time had seemed a dark horse, proved to be no more than an able administrator, lacking in the qualities of leadership. The rest ofM. Reynaud&apos;s team were all men of inferior stamp.130. To the question whether there was treachery from the first in the ranks of the politicians, I can only say that I never had any evidence of it,Had the army been able to withstand the German onslaught I have no reasonto suppose that France would not be fighting as a loyal ally to-day. I am not sure of M. Laval or of M. Baudouin. The former had always stood for corn-position both with Germany and with Italy, and it may well be that in the final stages he was in communication with the enemy, although, if he was, it is difficultto see what he gained by it: certainly no alleviation of the terms imposed.M. Baudouin is a man of quite different type. Two months ago his name wasscarcely known, and it is amazing that he should have succeeded in becoming,as he did, the dominating influence in Marshal Petain&apos;s Government. Voluble,specious and unreliable, he may well have played a shady part. But, again,if things had gone well, I have no reason to suppose that he would have soldhis country. With him, I think the dominating motives were fear and the desireto stand in well with the conqueror after the inevitable defeat,131. If I were asked how it was that in those dark hours there was noman to come forward to rally the forces of resistance, I can only repeat thatthe shock of learning that the army, which was the pride of France, was broken up and in full retreat was so paralysing that no Frenchman seemed capable ofreacting. In the later stages, the public was kept completely in the dark, whilst the presence in the Government of Marshal Petain, General Weygand and admiral Darlan seemed to afford a guarantee that the honour of France was insafe keeping.
132. Finally, the question may be asked whether there was somethingrotten in the state of France. It is also a difficult question to answer by aplain &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; In conversation with me a number of Frenchmen(M. Reynaud among them) ascribed the collapse in part to the abuse of the democratic system : life in France was too easy; facilities and favours were tooreadily obtained. Whilst there may be something in this, I do not accept itas an explanation of what occurred. From all accounts the mass of the french people was sound. It never had a chance to prove its worth. I should ratherdescribe France as a man who, stunned by an unexpected blow, was unable to riseto his feet before his opponent delivered the coup de grace.133. I cannot conclude this despatch without paying a tribute to my staff,every one of whom did most valuable work. Although racked with fatiguefrom a long succession of sleepless nights (there was an occasion when I foundfour of them at 5 o&apos;clock in the morning asleep over their cyphers from sheerexhaustion), they were always ready to carry on uncomplainingly. Their willingand cheerful help did much to encourage me and to mitigate the horror of thoselast days in Bordeaux, when, powerless to exercise any further influence, I watcheda great nation write with its own hand the darkest page in its history.I have, &amp;c.R, H. CAMPBELL.Annex 1.Message for the Prime Minister handed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador byM. Reynaud on the Evening of June 15, 1940.LE Conseil des Ministres, reuni cet apres-midi, a juge que le depart du gouvernement hors de France, en abandonnant le peuple francais au moment oilTennemi envahira tout le territoire national et imposera a la population decruelles privations et souffrances, peut provoquer une violente reaction de1&apos;opinion publique s&apos;il n&apos;est pas etabli que les conditions de paix de MM. Hitleret Mussolini sont inacceptables, comme contraires a 1&apos;honneur ou a 1&apos;interet vitalde la France.Le Conseil ne doute pas que ces conditions le seraient, en effet, mais ilconsidere comme indispensable que la preuve en soit rapportee, faute de quoi leGouvernement se dislpquerait, un grand nombre de ses membres refusant dequitter le territoire national.Pour parvenir a connaitre les conditions de l&apos;Allemagne, le Conseil a decidede demander au Gouvernement britannique 1&apos;autorisation de faire poser au gouvernement de Berlin par le Gouvernement des Etats-lJnis la question desavoir quelles seraient les conditions d&apos;armistice de 1&apos;Allemagne et de 1&apos;Italieenvers la France.Le President du Conseil a ete autorise a declarer au gouvernement britannique que la remise de la flotte a 1&apos;Allemagne serait consideree comme unecondition inacceptable si le Gouvernement britannique autorise le gouvernement francais a faire cette demarche.Au cas ou le Gouvernement britannique refuserait son consentement a cettedemarche, il parait vraisemblable qu&apos;en raison de 1&apos;opinion qui s&apos;est manifestedau Conseil d&apos;aujourd&apos;hui le President du Conseil serait appele a donner sademission.Le President du Conseil vient de recevoir la reponse du President Roosevelt,qui se declare incapable de fournir aux Allies le concours militaire qui lui etaitdemande.A la reunion qui eut lieu a Tours jeudi dernier il avait ete convenu, sur votredemande, que la question de 1&apos;autorisation d une demande d&apos;armistice serait poseea nouveau si la reponse du President Roosevelt etait negative.

"At this most fateful moment in the history of the modern world, the Governments of the United Kingdom and the French Republic make this declaration of indissoluble union and unyielding resolution in their common defence of justice and freedom, against subjection to a system which reduces mankind to a life of robots and slaves.

"The two Governments declare that France and Great Britain shall no longer be two nations, but one Franco-British Union."

"The Constitution of the Union will provide for joint organs of defence, foreign, financial and economic policies."

"Every citizen of France will enjoy immediately citizenship of Great Britain, every British subject will become a citizen of France."

"Both countries will share responsibility for the repair of the devastation of war, wherever it occurs in their territories, and the resources of both shall be equally, and as one, applied to that purpose.

"During the war there shall be a single War Cabinet, and all the forces of Britain and France, whether on land, sea or in the air, will be placed under its direction. It will govern from wherever it best can. The two Parliaments will be formally associated."

"The nations of the British Empire are already forming new armies. France will keep her available forces in the field, on the sea and in the air. The Union appeals to the United States to fortify the economic resources of the Allies and to bring her powerful material aid to the common cause.

"The Union will concentrate its whole energy against the power of the enemy no matter where the battle may be.

"And thus we shall conquer."

Cette question capitale doit etre reglee au prealablepour que puissent se poursuivre les deliberations du Gouvernement.Article 1&quot;. Repetition du texte.Article 2.

German Reply to French Proposals, June 22, 1940.Article 2 (Paris). If the development of the situation permits, considera-tion might be given to a solution going some way to meet the request of theFrench Government. It is among the possibilities. The treatment accorded to paris will depend on the internal situation of that great city, in which neither of the two Governments has any interest in seeing disorders take place. Theoccupation will involve only the number of troops indispensable for this purpose and for the sake of military discipline, which the chief of the French delega-tion will appreciate. In all events, when hostilities with England cease, a new situation will arise both for this and for the other questions which interest theFrench Government.Article 5 (Service Aircraft). General von Keitel has agreed to place him-self immediately in personal communication with Marshal Goring, whose reply isawaited. Meanwhile, he observes that in the text of article 5 delivery is onlycontingent (&quot; eventuelle &quot;).Article 8 (Fleet).- The proposed modification is not accepted for insertion in the convention. The Germans do not refuse to contemplate, acceptance ofthe proposal made, but they consider that it is a measure of application falling within the competence of the Armistice Commission.Article 16 bis (Foreigners in France). The German Government, not havingitself raised the question, considers that it can only be settled in the peace treaty.The provisional situation at present existing will continue therefore in principleuntil the treaty.  The German army puts forward no demand on this subject.Article 17 (Food-stuffs). The French proposal is being examined.Article 19 (German nationals in France). Formal refusal to suppress thisparagraph, but a formal declaration, on the other hand, that Germany willconfine her demands to the war-mongers of German nationality.Article 23 (Entry into force). The French translation as given does notcorrectly represent the German text. The two texts were compared this morning,and it follows that the phrase proposed by the French Government is that whichcorresponds best to the German text. This phrase is adopted in the French textand the German text needs no modification.
