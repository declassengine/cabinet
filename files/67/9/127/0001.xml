The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.Tuesday, November 11, 1941.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :MY Peoples have entered upon the third year of war with heightened vigourand resolution. I have seen the courage and fortitude with which they haveendured savage attacks from the air, and I have watched with admiration theselfless devotion of the Civil Defence Forces.During the past year My Forces, by sea, land and air, have continued, withthe powerful support of the Armed Forces of My Allies, to defend the cause of freedom throughout the world. The enemy has added to the number of countriestemporarily over-run, but the epic struggle of Greece and Yugoslavia, worthy of their glorious history, has inspired the civilised world.I heartily welcome as an Ally the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.On the 12th July My Government and the Government of the Soviet Unionagreed to aid each other in the war against Germany and to conclude no separatearmistice or treaty of peace. The heroic resistance of the armies of the soviet union has won My deepest admiration. A Conference on aid to Russia between representatives of My Government and of the Governments of the United Statesof America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has been held in Moscowwith eminently satisfactory results, and, in co-operation with the United Statesof America, My Empire is affording the Soviet Union all possible assistance against the common foe.The life-time of this Parliament has been memorable for the strengthening of the already close ties between My Governments and Peoples and the Govern-ment and People of the United States of America. A striking illustration ofthis growing intimacy was afforded by the meeting at sea between the Presidentof the United States and the Prime Minister of My Government in the UnitedKingdom. On the seas and the oceans, commanded by our two Navies in closestfraternity, a Charter was agreed upon and published to the world, which will stand as a beacon in history radiating resolution, justice and unselfish purpose.My Navy has continued to attack the enemy wherever it has been able tofind him. Aided by its Auxiliaries and the Fishing Fleet, it has maintainedunceasing vigil and has kept open the seaways on which My gallant merchant navy, and the Merchant Fleets of My Allies, have brought an increasing flow offood-stuffs and munitions.The position of My Forces in the Middle East has been greatly strengthened.The brilliant campaigns in East Africa, where the enemy, despite greatnumerical superiority, was evicted from the mountain fastnesses of Eritrea and ethiopia and either destroyed or captured, prove the skill of My Commandersand the endurance of My Forces from many parts of the Empire. These opera-tions, which augur well for the future, were rendered possible by the annihilationlast winter of the hostile army which sought to invade Egypt from Cyrenaica.
My Air Force has carried the war into the enemy&apos;s territory and has attacked with growing power his industries, communications, naval bases and shipping.By the boldness of its assaults, it has compelled the enemy to keep large airformations in the West.Developments in the Far East have engaged the close and constant attentionof My Government, and it has been necessary to increase the Forces Avhich defendMy territories in those regions.It has been a source of great gratification to Me that My Prime ministers of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, and New Zealand have found it possible to visit this country and confer with My Ministers in the UnitedKingdom. Valuable discussions have been held in Egypt with My Prime Ministerof the Union of South Africa. These personal exchanges are of the utmost value to My Ministers in the prosecution of the war.Members of the House of Commons :I thank you for the increased provision you have made towards the cost ofthe war. The unprecedented measures you have taken have been whole-heartedlysupported by My People, who have willingly borne the heavy additional taxationimposed upon them and have also freely responded to the call for loans.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The War Damage Act for damage to property caused by enemy action hasafforded immediate relief to many of My People, and the compensation which it provides has further strengthened the war economy of the country.Under Providence, and thanks to the unexampled efforts of the seafaringand farming communities, the food supplies of My People are assured.And I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may attend you.
The Kings Speech on the Opening of Parliament.Wednesday, November 12, 1941.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :THE developments of the past year have strengthened the resolution of my peoples and of My Allies to prosecute this war against aggression until finalvictory. Meanwhile, My Government, in consultation with the Allied Govermments, and with the goodwill of the Government of the United States of America,are considering the urgent problems which will face them when the nations nowenduring the tyranny of the oppressor have regained their freedom.I well know that My People will continue to respond wholeheartedly to thegreat demands made upon them to furnish My Forces with the instruments of victory, and that they are determined to meet, to the utmost of their power, theneeds of the Soviet Union in its heroic conflict.The United States are furnishing My Peoples and My Allies with war supplies of all kinds on a scale unexampled in history.My relations with Turkey, with whom I have a valued treaty of alliance,remain firmly based on trust and friendship.I welcome the restoration to his Throne of His Majesty the Emperor of ethiopia. Thus, the first country which fell a victim to aggression has been thefirst to be liberated and re-established.My loyal subjects in Malta continue to face air attack with a fortitude thatcommands My deepest admiration.Members of the House of Commons :You will be asked to make further financial provision for the conduct ofthe war.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The fulfilment of the task to which we are committed will call for theunsparing effort of every one of us. I am confident that My People will answerthis call with the courage and devotion which our forefathers never failed toshow when our country was in danger.My Government will continue to take all practical steps to sustain the health and well-being of My People under the stress of war.And I pray that Almighty God may give His blessing to your counsels.
