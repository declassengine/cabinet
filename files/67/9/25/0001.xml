(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT&apos;- )^J. C R E T.25th February, 1941.EXTENSION OF SUMMER TIME.Memorandum by the Hoir.e Secretary.A decision is required from the War Cabinet on the questionwhether summer time should be extended during the summer months byf. further hour.     A proposal to this effect was made to the civil defence Executive Sub-Committee by the Minister of Transport andafter interdepartmental consultations on the subject there havebc;.t;-n&quot;discussions at the Sub-Committee and at- the full Civil DefenceCommittee.     The considerations for and against the proposal may bosummarised as follows:-1.    An extra hour of evening daylight during the summer months would allow more opportunities for recreation to towndwellers and would, it is urged, have a tonic effect onmorale and health.2.    The extra hour of evening daylight would, be to some extentadvantageous to transport.      Apparently in railway marshalling yards and in the docks the loss of an hourTs-light in theearly morning would not affect the work, while the extensionof an hour&apos;s daylight in the evening would facilitate workin shunting in the railway yards and in loading and- unloadingships in the docks.      It is also said that an extra hour&apos;sdaylight in the evening would help to iron out the/eveningtraffic peak by encouraging workers to go home later.3.    As regards industry, both advantages and disadvantages havebeen urged.      In some factories it would be possible as aresult of such a change to work two shifts outside the black-out hours but on the other hand the workers might have tc goto their work or return from their work in darkness.      Thecotton industry are opposed to the change,  and as regards other industries emphasis has been laid on the disadvantages of bringing workers to their work in the dark.      In order toavoid this it has been suggested that the change, if made,should only operate during May, June, July and August, but even so the inclusion of the whole of August would causeobjection in some industries since black-out time would notend under the proposed change until half past six or later in the morning in the latter part of August.4.    On the other hand the change would have grave disadvantages to agriculture and would be strongly resented by the farmers.If the period for which the change is operative is restricted to the months of May, June, July and August the objection tostarting work in the dark would be diminished, but there still remains the objection that the change in the clock would delayfor another hour (by the clock) the time at which haymaking andharvesting can begin.

nnd distribution arrangements were made an hour later.      In anycase the hours of work have to be related to the tine by whichthe rest of the rural community regulates its activities,accordingly, a gap would be created in the morning during which,?t the seasons of haymaking and harvest, no profitable work canbe done, because the workers cannot get on the field until therlevv is dry.      The workers must then make up the time in the evening, and this involves payment of overtime for work whichcould otherwise have been done in the normal working hours and aninordinately long day, the beginning of which is determined by theclock, and the end by the sun.The suggestion has been made that farmers should insulate them-Jselves from the proposed change - that is, they should carry on with[their work as if the clock had not been altered, and that milktransport and distribution arrangements should be adjusted to enablefehen to do this.     But examination of this proposal has shown that difficulties arose at every point at which the farmers and theirporkers came in contact with the rest of the community who would beregulating their lives by the new time.It seems clear therefore that the change would cause realdifficulties to the agricultural community and would have a badpsychological effect on farmers and farm workers.      It will force onghriss     some waste of time and labour at a time when farmers andporkers are being told that every ounce of energy must be put intofthv. task of food production.     Rightly or wrongly, the farmers willWe- I that the Government in spite of all its protestations is itselfbropared to sacrifice the interests of food production in favour of purely urban considerations.On the whole, therefore, I have come to the conclusion that suchf vantages as this change would involve are not sufficient to outweighftho agricultural objections.H.M.2[;,th February. 1941.
