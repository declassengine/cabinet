Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET. Copy No.     6f)W.P, (G) (41) 119.October 27, 1941.WAR CABINET.MINISTRY OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION LABOUR NEEDS.Memorandum by Minister of Aircraft Production.THE Minister of Supply has reported to the War Cabinet (W.P. (G) (41)115) that his Department needs to recruit 360,000 men and women for production by June 1942, and has urged that steps should be taken to secure the more rapidrecruitment of women.The Ministry of Aircraft Production requires during the same period to recruit between 500,000 and 600,000 men and women. These are required toenable the Ministry of Aircraft Production to fulfil the current aircraft produc-tion programme, apart from the supplementary production programme now underconsideration.A large part of the increase in the Ministry of Aircraft Production labour force that is required can be met by the recruitment of women, and I stronglysupport the Minister of Supply in urging that more rapid recruitment is required.I recommend that the Ministry of Labour be invited to undertake, in co-operationwith the Production Departments, a drive to secure the women on whom theproduction programmes depend.J. T. C. M.-B.October 27, 1941.[23065]
