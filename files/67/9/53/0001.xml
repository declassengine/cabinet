SECRET Copy-No.  56W.P. (G) (41) 53.May 31, 1941.WAR CABINET.INDIA AND THE WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE War Cabinet had before them in October my memorandum W.P. (G)(40) 260, which gave the Governor-General&apos;s reasons for suspending action onhis Declaration of 8th August owing to the lack of co-operation shown by themain political parties. The Governor-GeneraFs proposals were approved(W.M. (40) 272nd Conclusions. Minute 11).2. As the outcome of discussions with his Council, with Governors andothers, the Viceroy has now put forward certain modified proposals to meet thewidely voiced demand for the association of Indians with the war effort. In viewof the intransigence of the leaders of the main political parties as against eachother even more than against the Government he proposes frankly to abandon the attempt to include and balance party representatives as such and to enlist theco-operation of men of good will and ability as individuals.3. The relevant telegrams exchanged with the Governor-General areannexed.4. So far as his Executive Council is concerned he now proposes only to addthree new members instead of the six originally contemplated. These additionsare, indeed, obviously required by the amount of work to be done. It is absurdthat in time of war the departments of Law and Supply should be doubled up under a single Member of Council, or that there should be no member responsiblefor the all-important function of &quot; Minister of Information.&quot; It is on that basis,and not as a political concession, that these additions should be justified.5. As regards the War Advisory Council promised in the Viceroy&apos;s state-ment of the 8th August last, consideration of this was inevitably deferred pending a decision on the expansion of the Executive. But, as the Princes pointed outvery emphatically to the Viceroy at the recent meeting of their Chamber, it isunfair to those who are only too anxious to co-ojDerate with the Government in developing India&apos;s war effort that their offers of help should be relegated to an indefinite future merely because party politicians cannot agree upon anything.There is, indeed, a very widespread feeling throughout the well-disposed elements in India that not sufficient advantage is being taken of the help they are eagerto give. This would be met by now setting up the promised War AdvisoryCouncil.6. The members of this would consist partly of persons representing thepoint of view and interests of the different Provinces and States, and able to enlist local effort in support of the general war policy of the Government, partly of persons selected as individuals for the value of the advice or help they wouldgive in connexion with industrial, man-power or labour questions. I see no reason why helpful and influential members of the Legislature should not be included[22569] this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1941.
in their individual capacity. But I am doubtful herein differing from theViceroy as to the advisability of including ex officio, and in a body, the membersof a Committee of the Legislature which General Auchinleck is setting up todiscuss with him personally questions affecting his Department. That seems tome to cut across the principle of selection on individual merit and to introduce into the Council an element which may easily find itself at variance with the restand which may prove more inclined merely to criticise on political grounds than to co-operate in practical effort.7. These proposals will not, of course, satisfy Congress or even the rela-tively moderate elements represented by Sir Tej Sapru and the sponsors of therecent Bombay resolution. But there is no way of satisfying demands whichraise the issue of India&apos;s future constitution while the present deadlock withinIndia is unresolved. On the other hand they do meet the charge that our pro-posals of last summer were never seriously meant and that at the first excuse wehave dropped them and mean to do nothing. To that extent they will, I think,meet the more reasonable critics here and in America, while, even in India, Ibelieve they will, in practice, help to convince at any rate the more well-disposed that we do welcome Indian co-operation. I believe, too, that they will mean an improvement in the efficiency of the Executive and, through the war advisory Council, a measure of encouragement to India&apos;s war effort which mayin practice prove much greater than the Viceroy seems to expect.8. In paragraph 7 of his telegram 1107-S. (Annex III) the Governor-General mentions the general consensus of opinion among the Governors againstsubstituting non-official for official Advisers in Section 93 Provinces. I am prepared to acquiesce in these views.9. As regards the suggestion of a general gaol delivery of the Congresscivil disobedience prisoners, I am opposed to that at the present moment, or asin any way connected with the above proposals, though not unwilling to considerit at some time under conditions which would make it quite clear that we havenot had our hands forced by Congress. The Viceroy has since expressed his agreement with my point of view.L. S. A.India Office,May 31, 1941.
Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated 22nd May, 1941.1029-S. I have been busy discussing with my Council (collectively as wellas individually) and with prominent individuals since returning to Simla what,if any, move we can make in the present situation within the terms of the Augustoffer. I have made it clear that objections to Bombay Conference proposals soclearly stated in your speech are decisive, and that the August offer representsour limit.2. I find general acceptance of view that we can look for no move fromthe parties and that neither Congress nor Moslem League would budge; and thesuggestion which I put forward that we had better in these circumstancesabandon parties and get back to men has, I think, a good deal of support.Selection of men might bring us in conflict with parties. I discuss that below,but I think we should be able to avoid such a conflict. There is also general feeling that stalemate has gone on long enough, and that something ought tobe done, though great difficulty is found in making suggestions. Finally,desirability of giving a chance to those who are prepared to work with us, evenif Congress and Moslem League will not play, has been stressed.3. Rough outline of what I would, in these circumstances, recommend toyou and to Cabinet is as follows : (a) Expansion of my Council by addition of three non-officials. The namesI have in view are Homi Mody, Sir Akbar Hydari and Raghavendra Rao from your Council if you could spare him. In addition, if I recommend Bajpai to you for the post of Agent-General in U.S.A. and you accept that, I could fill his place by an additional Hindu non-official of the type of Kunzru. If ZafrullahKhan were to go later either to Privy Council or to Federal Court, I shall have tofind a second non-official Moslem, but we need not consider contingency at themoment.(b) Fresh Portfolios will be found by separating Law and Supply and givingSupply to Mody; by creating a department of Information, for which I have inview Raghavendra Rao (he would not be heavily burdened, and there is advantage in having a man of his calibre not too immersed in departmental business); andby a Department of Man-Power and Labour, precise designation of which canbe considered later, for which I have in view Akbar Hydari. Hydari is 72, andas you know I have seen some deterioration in him in recent months. But he isof very high standing, he is unquestionably a good Moslem with valuable contacts,and what is most important I would not regard his appointment as likely to admitof being interpreted as a challenge to Jinnah and Moslem League. You willprobably agree with me as to the extreme undesirability of involving ourselves in trouble with the Moslem League, however tiresome Jinnah may be, when theinternational and Middle East Moslem situation is so delicate. Zafrullah Khanis perfectly prepared to take on the Moslem League, and regards Jinnah as being at the moment more irritating than even Gandhi. I sympathise with him. ButI remain unshaken in my view (for which there is substantial support in my council) that it is desirable if possible to keep the Moslem League togetherbecause of post-war discussions, because it represents the only organisedopposition to Congress, and because, as I have said, at a time when the middle east situation is so delioate, avoidance of a stand-up fight with it is desirable if practicable. Nor do I want to risk combination against us of Congress and moslem League.4. I would contemplate announcing simultaneously with reconstructedCouncil that I propose to have a War Committee of the Council consisting ofthe Viceroy, the Commander-in-Chief, the Finance Member, the Supply Member,and the Member in charge of Man-Power and Labour. That would be a somewhat extra-constitutional body (proposals regarding support of wholeCouncil would have to be ratified by Council), but the justification for it is real and it ought to appeal to public opinion.5. I would contemplate more or less simultaneously establishing a war advisory Council on the lines which you and I discussed last year. But, givenattitude of parties, I would not ask Jinnah, Congress or other parties to nominate[22569] b 2
men, and would make selection myself (after discussion with my expandedCouncil). I would propose that the members (10) of Auchinleck&apos;s proposedDefence Committee of the Central Legislature should be ex officio members of it.This would have the advantage of linking the Central Legislature with it. Myannouncement would make it clear that here, as elsewhere, we regard it as apatriotic duty for persons invited to help India at this critical time.6. I recognise that these proposals go nothing like as far as the BombayConference, and that they will also bypass Congress, Moslem League and otherorganised parties. They also involve (in application of that policy) abandoningapproach to Aney or Ambedkar (I would propose to write to them both explaining that I had not asked them to serve because I was getting away from party basis).We might anticipate that they would be open to severe criticism as not goingsufficiently far, and it is just possible that they might provoke Sikander orNazimuddin (representing Moslem League) from pique at not being included.But I do not think I can consider either of them or any other prominent membersof League without playing into Jinnah&apos;s hands. We shall also be criticised overthe personnel on the ground that Hydari is old and Rao out of touch with India,But with our two main sources of supply barred by the attitude of Congress andthe League, the task of finding new men of requisite quality is most difficult.I have considered Mirza Ismail as an alternative to Hydari. But though able,he has in my opinion behaved ill in Mysore in his relations with the newMaharaja, and I would be reluctant to consider him.7. So much for Centre. As regards Provinces, no difficulty arises over&quot; Parliamentary&quot; Provinces. The difficult question is what, if anything, is tobe done in Section 93 Provinces. In discussions in my Council there was considerable sympathy for accompanying any move at Centre with establishmentof non-official Advisers in Provinces. Opinion outside is divided on that point.I am consulting Governors at once and will, let you know their reaction. So longas policy of Moslem League and Jinnah is as at present, we could hope for noMoslem League names as non-official Advisers save subject to acceptance ofJinnah&apos;s whole terms, which we are not prepared to accept. On Congress sideyou will remember that Gandhi, in his discussions with me in 1939, was not greatly fussed by our putting in official Advisers he preferred that they shouldbe officials and preferably non-Indians, and there has been practically no protest against fact that almost all are European and official. Congress anxiety not tosee rival parties, such as Justice or Moslem League, entrenching themselves byuse of non-official Advisers is, of course, understandable. On the whole, subjectto views of Governors, I am disposed to the view strongly urged on me byKrishnamachari that we should leave Provincial arrangement alone and shouldtake line that Constitution was functioning in Provinces; that it was open to anyone who could produce a majority to get it going in noimial way, and thatin these circumstances we did not propose to appoint non-officiai Advisers;though I recognise that that argument appeals to the head rather than the heartand will not have too good a press.8. One other very difficult question which we ought, I think, to consider is whether or not there should be a general jail delivery simultaneoushy withannouncement of arrangements outlined above if ultimately approved by new cabinet. We could take line that we are anxious to give Congress a further opportunity, and it may be that Gandhi, sufficiently satisfied that his tactics hadnot been wise, would respond to extent of not requiring those releasedimmediately, to re-start Satyagraha. I imagine that release might be of somevalue for you in Parliament and internationally, as proof of our continuedreadiness to be reasonable. I should like, too, if decision were to be in favour of release, to get this issue out of the way before I get my new Council. On theother side there are very strong arguments. We should be represented as havingshown again that there was no finality in our sanctions against Congress, andthat it was only a question of time and pressure before we raised them. It wouldbe necessary to let out Nehru and the whole of the Working Committee, and thatgives them an opportunity of getting together and concerting policy against usagain. We might anticipate that since Congress has nothing to gain fromexpansion of Council and other arrangements referred to in above, they wouldwithout delay endeavour to make the position of the new Government asunpleasant as possible. Gandhi and the Working Committee are well aware that they have only to call off civil disobedience to be immediately released.  What
I want to avoid is, of course, the suggestion that the moment we got our expandedCouncil, liberal principles prevailed to such an extent as to convince you and methat the arguments which had hitherto held good for imprisoning these people were really without foundation. I would welcome your reaction and that ofCabinet. I could not offer final advice until I had consulted Governors andprobably discussed in Council.9. Line of any announcement (which would be made here) would be (I am not drafting as yet) that we have already made it clear that the whole Constitu-tional position would be open after the war for examination; that difficulties ofrevising the Constitution in war are obvious; that we put forward last august the best transitional arrangements we could; that our appeal to parties to sup-port us was infructuous then and that, though they have had a sufficient intervalto revise their opinion, we are regretfully satisfied (and our view is now confirmed by reactions to your speech) that there is no prospect of support from parties;that in these circumstances, with war pressure increasing every day and with increasing signs of pressure in India that India should be more closely associatedwith war effort, we are satisfied that we must fall back on men, and we regard it as a public duty on the part of those we approach to help us and India by their readiness to serve. Statement would then proceed with arrangements on thelines suggested above.&apos; 10. I think rough outline I have given you will enable you to see what is inmy mind, and I would hope that in very difficult circumstances that confront usyou and Cabinet would regard it as generally suitable. I am anxious (so as notto waste surprise value) to keep personnel I have in view, &amp;c, wholly secret atthis moment, and indeed our general intention, though fact that position has beenexplored in some detail in my Council inevitably gives rise to rumours here thatsome movement is contemplated. I would only add that if anything is going tobe done, I think the sooner it is done the better. I have no idea whether Ffydarior Mody would be prepared to serve and will not, of course, tackle them untilgeneral scheme is approved. We can discuss separately and at greater leisurecomposition of War Council. I would repeat that I do not believe that thisscheme will give real satisfaction, and it will be violently criticised as fallingshort of even moderate demands and as not conceding transfer of Defence orFinance (both strongly favoured, e.g., by Mody) to non-officials. Schuster, StanleyReed and Moore have encouraged confident hope here that Parliament is anxious for something much more extensive, and we shall not be able to get rid of that.I am quite clear, too, that it will not enhance our war effort, which is limited only by shortages of equipment which we cannot make in India. But I think myscheme is worth trying, and if we can get it going it will keep people&apos;s minds busyfor some little time to come. It has the advantage of (a) being within the termsof the August offer, (b) not prejudicing post-war discussions.ANNEX II.Telegram from Secretary of State to Governor-General, dated 24zth May, 1941.5804.   Your telegram 22nd May,. 1029-S.I am much attracted by the main features of your plan which, while definitelymaking it clear that you are not prepared to go on angling for support ofunreasonable party politicians, can still be regarded as an honest interpretation of our offer of August 1940 to associate Indians more fully with the conduct ofthe war. It meets the not unreasonable demand of the Princes that you should notreject the co-operation of those who are willing to help merely because certainpoliticians either refuse to help or are only concerned with manoeuvring forposition against each other. In any case it should give you, both on yourExecutive and on your All-India War Council, a more useful body from the pointof view of helping the actual war effort. It will not, of course, satisfy the vocalpolitical elements. But it may well in actual working have a steadily increasing-effect upon Indian public opinion, while both here and in the United States it
should do much to meet the growing criticism that our offer of August 1940 wasnot meant seriously, and that we are only too glad to have an excuse for a purelynegative attitude to all demands for a closer association of India with the war.2.   I will take your proposals in order : Expansion of Council. I entirely agree with addition of three non-officials,bringing the total numbers to nine. This seems much better as initial stage of expansion than total of twelve which we contemplated last year. I am also gladthat you see means of providing all three with worth while portfolios.3. I will gladly spare Rao, who seems an excellent choice, but I am content to leave selection of other persons to be nominated in your hands. If you should decide against Hydari on grounds of age or for other reasons or in case Nizamcannot spare him, claims of Krishnamachari in Baroda and of Noon here seemdeserving of consideration. Nor would I wholly exclude Mirza Ismail, who has a fine record of constructive ability, merely on grounds of his having tried to override his new Maharaja. I am sorry that Sikander seems excluded bydifficulty of replacement in Punjab and possible antagonism of Jinnah.4. War Committee of Council. On assumption that rules requiringcollective consultation on certain matters will continue to be observed, I see no constitutional objection and considerable practical advantage in concentration ofthese special war portfolios and Finance in a smaller Committee meeting with greater frequency. I take it that ratification by whole Council of proposal to setup Committee would dispose of any doubt about propriety of Committee being established.5.    War Advisory Council. Following points occur to me : (i) I agree that it would no longer be appropriate to invite communities orparties to nominate their representatives, indeed I hope that Council (possiblydropping prefix &apos;&apos; Advisory &apos;&apos; and calling it &apos;&apos; All India War Council&apos;&apos; to distinguish it from proposed War Committee) may now be constituted on a some-what broader basis so as to include primarily representatives of States andProvinces, business and other material interests closely bound up with war effort.If an individual otherwise suitable for nomination on one of the foregoinggrounds, e.g., a Provincial representative, happened to belong to a party organisa-tion, I take it this need not be held to bar his selection, and this might cover notonly representatives from provinces like Punjab or Bengal but otherwise suitablesuggestions from Section 93 Provincial Governors, if it is clear that they arenominated by you as representing a provincial and not a party interest. Justpossibly, too, a man like Ambedkar might be considered as representing an element in India&apos;s national life which might otherwise be excluded.(ii) I am very doubtful at first sight about your suggestion that the membersof Auchinleck&apos;s proposed Defence Committee of the Legislature should beex officio members of the War Council. For one thing it cuts across yourprinciple of ignoring the parties and bringing in those of your own selection whoare most willing and able to be helpful in action and not merely to criticise or make party capital. For another, it might stand in the way of such closer association of the War Council or of members of it with the Executive as I suggestin (iii). On the other hand, I see no reason why on occasion Auchinleck&apos;sCommittee should not be invited to attend a joint session with the Council.(iii) Link between All-India Council and proposed War Committee of yourExecutive Council could perhaps be made a close one, e.g., means might be found of utilising services of some members of the War Council on special committeespresided over by appropriate Member of Executive Council to assist and stimulatecompliance with demands of Central War Departments on States and Provincesindustries, &amp;c. There seems some advantage in finding definite work for those members of War Council free to undertake it rather than to encourage them toserve wholly in a critical capacity.6. Provincial Non-official A dvisers. I note that you are consulting-Governors as regards political value and general utility of appointing non-official advisers. Subject to your further recommendations in light of Governors&apos; views,I should be inclined to leave them to do as they may each find expedient in thismatter, which seems essentially one of provincial concern. What might be worthwhile in some cases is adding unofficial advisers appointed not in connexion with current administration, but with the special duty of studying social reformquestions and making suggestions.
7. Delivery of political prisoners. I appreciate your exposition ofarguments for and against gaol delivery simultaneously with announcement ofarrangements outlined above, but as at present advised, and subject to any furtherconsiderations you may urge and of course views of Cabinet, consider argument in favour outweighed by the following serious disadvantages : (i) It would inevitably be interpreted by Moslems and in other quarterswhich have supported maintenance of law and order during civil disobediencecampaign as a surrender to Congress and a desertion of Governments friends.(ii) Congress would regard it as a sign of weakness, and would say thankyou for nothing so far as your other changes are concerned.I might see less objection to later gaol delivery entirely dissociated from your present action with regard to Executive and War Council, given sufficient evidence of breakdown of civil disobedience or of some altered attitude of congress towards war effort. Alternatively it might even possibly be givencontemptuously as a &quot; boon &quot; synchronising with some notable war achievement of the Indian Forces whose recruitment they have vainly tried to obstruct.8. I will await any further comments which you would like to go beforeCabinet before circulating your proposals with a request for approval to go ahead.ANNEX III.Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated 27th May, 1941.1107-S. Your telegram of May 24th, 5804. Constitutional position. Very manythanks.  I have the following comments : Paragraph No. 2 and paragraph No. 3. I am grateful to you for your readiness-ness to spare Rao. My telegram 1029-S. gave my provisional views as regardsallocation of portfolio. I should prefer, however, to keep a free hand about this for the moment. If additional vacancies were to become available owing toappointment of Bajpai to Washington, or the like, I might have to reconsider :and if I put A.R.P., which is now of great importance, in with Man-Power andLabour there might be advantage in my giving that portfolio to Rao, who is amuch younger and more active man than Hydari.3.   Your paragraph No. 4. I am very glad that you agree.4. Your paragraph No. 5. (i) I think there is a great deal in your sugges-tions : but here again would prefer not to commit myself in detail as to precisebasis or composition of War Advisory Council as yet. We can discuss this at greater leisure if the Cabinet approve general plan. I see force in your suggestionthat the provinces should be represented as such if conditions make that possible.I agree that the fact that a provincial representative belongs to a party organisa-tion need not disqualify him if he is willing to serve. It is, I think, possible thatJinnah would instruct his followers not to serve, and it may be assumed that congress representatives would not serve.5. Your paragraph No. 5. (ii) I still prefer my own suggestion, thatAuchinleck&apos;s Defence Committee should be ex officio membersof the War AdvisoryCouncil (by whatever name we call that body). I do not think it cuts acrossprinciple of not putting in representatives of parties as such, and it has the immense advantage of associating, without raising any point of principle, thecentral fabric with the War Advisory Council and with the changes we now con-template. That might be of some importance as affecting attitude of central legislature towards expanded Executive Council and new arrangement generally,and I trust on reconsideration that you will no longer feel any hesitation in agreeing.6. Your paragraph No. 5. (iii) I am quite ready to keep this suggestion inmind, but doubt if it would work in practice. War Advisory Council, as we con-templated last year, would probably meet every couple of months for three or four days, and would not be in constant session. I understand that your suggestionlefers only to individual members who are &quot; free to undertake&quot; specific worksuch as you mention.   It goes without saying, also, that we are likely from time
to time to need individual members of War Advisory Council to help us overspecific questions. But I would prefer to choose them ad hoc as occasion may offer.It is not going to be an easy body to content or to handle in any case, and I want to avoid jealousies, though I am as anxious as you to give it or individual members something constructive to do as far as possible.7. Your paragraph No. 6. Provincial non-official advisers. I have repeatedviews of Governors to you.* I do not think this is a matter that can be left to individual provinces, and am clear it must be settled on an all-India basis. Thereis general agreement, as you will see (subject to Hope&apos;s remarks), as to case againstnon-official advisers, and I would propose in the circumstances to go ahead inthe Centre on the lines already recommended for Cabinet approval if that approvalis given and to leave provinces as they are. I agree with Stewart that we shallget more pressure in respect of provinces in due course. But I am disposed toleave that to develop.8. Your paragraph No. 7. Delivery of political prisoners. I accept your views.ANNEX IV.Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State, dated 27th May, 1941.1108-S. Following telegram from Lumley. Very important. 450 dated25th May, is repeated for information.   Begins:-1. I am most grateful for opportunity to give you my personal reactions to your proposals.2. I am sure that there will be a disposition to welcome a movement of thiskind. The party spokesmen will, of course, criticise it as inadequate, but many who are sick of political leaders and becoming anxious about the war danger, w,illwelcome it if it can be made sufficiently impressive.3. The three names you mention for expansion of Council I would expect to be regarded, except for Hydari, as rather light in weight, and as not bringing in a large enough slice of those professing willingness to co-operate. I would liketo see someone with a bigger name included, like Jayakar. Hydari and Jayakarwould provide the impression of elder men and would carry a considerable amountof respect.4. If there is any chance of arranging it, it would be of advantage if other possible vacancies you mention could be made to coincide with proposed expansionso that four or five new names could be announced simultaneously.5. For many, reasons I would welcome inclusion of Mody. He is courageousand can be trusted. He is, however, often labelled as a reactionary and does notcommand a following. His inclusion would, I think, be more acceptable if itwere balanced by someone of Kunzru&apos;s type. Sir Ardeshir Dalai is the ablestParsi, but I expect Tatas would feel his loss severely.6. I have no comments to make about the War Advisory Council, exceptthat I would agree that functions rather than areas should be represented.7. I feel there is a good chance that a movement of this kind will go doAvnwell, but I would repeat my anxiety that it should be made as striking as possible,and that it should give the impression that the most prominent of possibleco-operators have joined the Government, although limitations are probablygreater than I am aware of.   Ends.Not printed.
