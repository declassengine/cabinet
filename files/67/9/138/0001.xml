THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET..,W.P.(G)(41) 158.?6th November. 1941. COPY NO.&apos; fWAR CABINET.Visits by Members of Parliament to Ireland.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.&apos;The Cabinet at their meeting on the l6th October agreedthat the objections to granting to Members of both Houses ofParliament exemption from the Regulations controllingtraffic to Ireland outweighed the advantages of any concession;but no consideration was given on that occasion to the questionwhich was raised during the Debate on 21st October by Sir Hugh0&apos;Neill and others of distinguishing visits by M.P. s toNerthern Ireland from visits by M.P.s to Eire.As regards visits by M.P.s to Northern Ireland, whichis of course part of the United Kingdom and electsrepresentatives to the House of Commons, I think the generalpolicy should be to grant permission if the M.P; assures me.that the visit is not for private purposes, such for exampleas a rest or holiday, but is for public purposes inconnection with his duties as an M.P, unless in any exceptional case there were clear security considerationsforbidding this course.As regards Southern Ireland, however, different considerations arise;    and in my view permission for visits to Southern Ireland should only be granted on the same grounds   .as those on which permission would be granted for a visit to an overseas Dominion or to a Colony.    The general principlegoverning the grant of permits to go abroad is that theapplicant must show that his visit will&apos;be advantageous forthe purpose of the war effort.    If, therefore, an M.P.&apos;asked to go to, say, Canada either for some private purposeor for some public purpose which has no connection with thewar and could have no advantageous effect on the war effort,permission would be refused:   and I propose that in similar circumstances permission should be refused to M.P.S to go to eire. &apos;It should be noted that the grant or refusal of permitsto go abroad is itself in no way dependent on shipping facilities.Shipping facilities vary greatly as between different overseasdestinations;    and even as regards the same destination at different times;    and it would be quite Impossible to pursue anydefensible lines of general policy, if they were accepted asa factor to be considered.    There is therefore no case fordistinguishing between Eire and other places abroad merely because travel is easier to Eire than to other places, and Ican see no ground on which It. would be justifiable to grant to M.P.S permits to visit Eire for reasons which would not warrant the grant of a permit to visit an overseas Dominionor a Colony.
In the previous Memorandum which I submitted to theCabinet I said that &quot;once a traveller has reached NorthernIreland there is nothing to prevent him going into Eire&quot;.This, consideration, however, though applicable to ordinary&apos; members-: of the public (and indeed the principal justification for the inclusion of Northern Ireland in the Scheme ofControl)is not necessarily applicable to an M.P.    If an 11. P.who asks for permission to - go to. Northern Ireland gives mean assurance that he will not go to Eire without expresspermission   for this purpose I should ordinarily feel it right to accept such an assurance.&apos; As regards M.P.s,therefore, it is possible to grant a permit to visitNorthern Ireland without at the same time authorising theM.P. to visit Eire.&quot; Since the matter was last considered by the cabinet mr.&apos; McGovern has sent me a further application for permission to visit Ireland.    In this application he has put&apos; forward grounds which were not previously mentionedand:has made it clear.that the purpose of his visit to&apos;Northern Ireland is for public business connected with his duties as an M.P.    I have told him that had he previouslyput forward an application on the facts now stated a permitwould have been granted him for travel to Northern Ireland,but that as regards.Eire different considerations would have arisen.Mr. McGovern has given a verbal assurance to Mr. Peakethat if he Is allowed to visit Northern Ireland he Willnot go into Southern Ireland also xvithout express permissionfrom the Home Office for this purpose.    He has, however, asked that he may be allowed to visit Southern Ireland for thepurpose of meeting &quot;two Labour Members of Eire Parliament,some   members of Dublin Town Council, and finally Mr, de valera&quot;.    On the principles suggested above this&apos; applicationdoes not disclose grounds on which it would be justifiable.ib! grant him permission to visit Eire.    In view of Mr. McGovernattitude towards the&apos; war it cannot be said that his proposedinterviews with Members of the Eire Parliament, or: with some members of the &apos;Dublin Town Council, or with Mr. De Valera,are. likely to be helpful to the war effort.&apos;^0n the facts before me I submit. that the proper course is (a) to grant Mr. McGovern permission to visit NorthernIreland on the ground that he has now satisfied me that thisvisit is for purposes connected with his public duties asan M.P., and on the understanding that he will not go to southern Ireland;    and (b)  to refuse him permission to go to eire on&apos; the grounds that he has not satisfied me that this proposed visit would be likely to be helpful to the war effort and that the granting of permits to visit Eire must be governed by similar considerations to those which govern the granting of permits to go to the Dominions of the Colonies.H.M.&quot;HOME:OFFICE.26th November, 1941.
