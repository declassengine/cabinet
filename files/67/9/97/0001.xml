7th S september.,,. 1941,COPY NO.$war CABINET.PRIORITY   MACHINERY.Mer.ipxaiidum by the Oh. nLrman of the Pro due ti okExecutive.1. Priority of Production is at present governed by a direction issued on June 14th, 1940, by the then Minister ofSupply on behalf of his Ministry, and of the Admiralty, theWar Office,Production,the Air Ministry and the Ministry of aircraft copy of this Direction is attached.2.      At a meeting on July 23rd,  1941&quot;&quot;   the production executive decided that,  as  the list of priorities neededamendment,  a new Direction should be prepared to incorporatean up-to-date list and that power should be taken in that direction to certify additional items from time to time as having such priority classifioation as might be decided bythe Executive.3.      At a meeting on August 13th,  1941*   the executive had before them a draft Direction which had been preparedaccordingly and gave it their approval.    As the production executive has been given the function of establishingpriorities where necessary/ it was thought appropriate thatthis revised Direction should be issued on behalf of all theMinisters who are members of the Executive.    The legal basis for the issue of Priority Directions is Regulation 5 5 of theDefence (General) Regulations, 1939,  and all the ministers concerned are competent authorities under that Regulation.The Minister of Supply and the Minister of Aircraft Productionalso possess specific -powers as to priority derived fromSection 7 of the Ministry of Supply Act,  1939.    (This Sectionhas been applied to the Minister of Aircraft Production underArticle 4 of the Minister of Aircraft Production (Transfer of functions) Order,  1940. )4,      In addition to any general priority classification,it is necessary to provide for the production of specialarticles to be included from time to time in an appropriatepriority category,  e. g.  laggard elements of production or items which become specially urgent at special times.    To meet this need paragraph 3 of the draft Direction provides for the issueof Certificates jointly on behalf of the Ministers issuing theDirection,5.      It was proposed that both the general Direction andany Certificates subsequently issued should be transmitted to individual contractors by the Production Department directly concerned with them.-1-s P.E.

Si      Tho Minister of Supply-  who was not able to hepresent at the meeting on August&quot;13th- has  objected to theprocedure proposed,..    There is no dispute as to the 3 istof articles embodied in the draft Priority Direction,, buthe objects to the issue of any priority Order or Direction     jon behalf of all; the Ministers forming the production executive,,    He has proposed that they should be issued either by himself as Minister of Supply, or that any necessarypriority Directions should he issued by each of theMinisters concerned under the authorjty  bhey derive from theDefence Boguht:ons.;7q      The Minister of Supply has offered to &quot;communicate with the Ministers concerned^ when he has occasion toissue priority Directions,  but nothing but confusion canresult from the issue of Directions by a number of separateMinisters acting independently and without any systematicmethod of consultation,    The Production Executive was set-up to provide for such consultation and if it is not considered a suitable instrument for the purpose it had better be abolished.    The members of the Executive.-,  otherthan the Minister of Supply7 therefore ask that theprocedure outlined, in paragraphs 3 and 4 above should be approved,  lze0  that priority Directions should be Issuedby or on behalf of the Ministers forming the production executive acting jointly,Great George 31reet, S.0 W*; 1-2-
