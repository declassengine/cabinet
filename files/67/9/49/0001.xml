This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, May, 1941SECRETCopy No. r 7W,P. (G.) (41) 4914th May, 1941WAR CABINETADMINISTRATION OF ETHIOPIA\   MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARA decision is required with regard to the form of administration to beadopted in Ethiopia.On the 4th February, 1941, a statement of Government policy was made inthe House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asfollows:  &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome the re-appearance of anindependent Ethiopian state and recognize the claim of the Emperor HaileSelassie to the throne. The Emperor has mtimated to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment that he will need outside assistance and guidance. His Majesty?sGovernment agree with this view and consider that any such assistance and guidance in economic and political matters should be the subject ofinternational arrangement at the conclusion of peace. They reaffirm thatthey have themselves no territorial ambitions in Abyssinia.In the meanwhile the conduct of military operations by Imperial forcesin parts of Abyssinia will require temporary measures of military guidance and control. These will be carried out in consultation with the Emperorand will be brought to an end as soon as the situation permits &quot;.From this, it will be seen that the intention was to place executive power inthe hands of a Military Governor, in consultation and collaboration with theEmperor. This was in accordance with the views held at that time by theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, who had said in a telegram of 23rd Januarythat he assumed Ethiopia would be under British military^ occupation untilformally handed over, on terms to be agreed later, to the Emperor; until thattime, the British had obligations under international law to ensure law andorder, safety of the Italian population, safeguarding of property, etc., and thenecessary power to discharge those responsibilities must be retained. Fromthis point of view General Wavell thought it would be most inadvisable to restore at once Ethiopian civil administration, although with the Emperor&apos;consent his Chiefs might be used where suitable in local administration. Fur-fher, British occupation connoted British ideas of justice, and it might benecessary to set up British military courts.At a Defence Committee on 9th April, the Prime Minister said he thoughtthat it would be desirable to bring Haile Selassie as soon as possible to addis ababa and replace him on the throne; but that so long as military operationsrendered it necessary, the country would have to be administered by the militaryauthorities. In deference to representations from General Wavell, it was agreedthat the return of the Emperor to the capital would depend on the local situation,which the Commander-in-Chief was in the best position to interpret.In the course of discussions at the Standing Inter-departmental committee at the War Office, the broad outlines of a scheme of aohninistration for Ethiopiaon the above basis were considered, and the Foreign Office representativestated that his department had in mind the appointment of a High commissioner in Addis Ababa, who would have no executive responsibility but would have thetask of interpreting political requirements to the Emperor. A telegram was sentto General Wavell in this sense, but the replies received from the General Officer
Commanding, East Africa, and Sir Philip Mitchell, Chief Political Officer,indicate some divergence of view with regard to the administration of Ethiopiafrom that which had hitherto been accepted in London; and it appears from recent telegrams that General Wavell agrees with General Cunningham and sir philip Mitchell.There appear to be three possible alternatives for the future administrationoi Ethiopia.First, the country might be regarded simply as an Occupied enemy territory and a full Military Administration set up with the Emperor as a merefigurehead.Second, taking the purely Ethiopian standpoint, the Emperor&apos;s full de juresovereignty might be revived, and the country regarded as having regained its full independence now, in which case any guidance proffered by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be accepted by the Emperor of his own free will, or couldbe rejected by him.The third possibility, like the first one mentioned above, takes the viewthat by evicting the Italians, His Majesty&apos;s Government are in fact the Occupy-ing Power until the Peace: this alternative is, I understand, more defensiblefrom the point of view of international law than the second course, setout in the previous paragraph. The Emperor, whose claim to the throne isrecognized by His Majesty&apos;s Government, resumes his throne at once in fulfil-ment of our intentions in that respect, and will also assume certain functionson the understanding that a full settlement of all aspects of the Ethiopianquestion can be made only at the Peace Conference. Thus in those parts of ethiopia where it is a military necessity His Majesty&apos;s Government and forces will retain full control; in the rest of the country the Emperor will rule, as itwere, on our behalf, but through his own decrees and using his own executives,duly guided and controlled by British advisers.Of these three possibilities the first appears to be ruled out because theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, states that he cannot possibly make avail-able the troops which would be required if he were to accept sole responsibilityfor the administration of the whole of Ethiopia.The second possibility anticipates to an undesirable degree issues whichmust be left to the Peace Conference; and further, the responsibility of HisMajesty&apos;s Government for what might happen in Ethiopia could not be divestedby an attempt to place the whole of it on the shoulders of Haile Selassie.Moreover, so long as any enemy forces remain in North Africa, there is thepossibility that areas of Italian East Africa which may now appear fit to be handed over to Ethiopian control may again become the scene of militaryoperations.  This course would also be contrary to the views of General Smuts.The third possibility also has certain disadvantages: Ethiopian adminis-tration may be inefficient and uneconomical in spite of the efforts of the deputy Chief Political Officer advising the Emperor at the centre, and ofthe political missions resident with the Rases in the provinces; and there maybe difficulties of a minor sort in transferring a district, should necessity arise,from British military administration to Ethiopian control or vice versa. Butit does implement the statement made in Parliament by Mr. Eden on 4th Feb-ruary, 1941; it is acceptable to General Wavell, General Cunningham, and toSir Philip Mitchell; and it avoids pre judgment of issues which will be the concern of the Peace Conference.The Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office (Sir William Malkin) has stated hisopinion that in international law Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia is not affectedde jure by the British Occupation, and that the position of the country remainsthat of enemy territory under military occupation and administration. It wouldbe possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to recognize Ethiopia as an inde-pendent state with the Emperor as its head; the question whether this wouldbe desirable is a political one, but this action would not bind other countries,least of all Italy, and the position in this respect would have to be regularizedin.any eventual Peace Treaty.I think we should accept the views of the Commander-in-Chief, middle east, the General Officer Commanding, East Africa and the Chief political officer as to the nature of the administration to be set up in Ethiopia; and if my colleagues agree, I propose that the telegram annexed to this Paper shouldbe sent to General Wavell: the terms of this telegram have been agreed by theStanding Inter-departmental Committee.  From reports received from the Near
APPENDIX TO W.P. (G.) (41) 49I. His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome the reappearance of anindependent Ethiopian State, but in the meantime the conduct of militaryoperations requires that the Emperor should abide strictiy by the advice ofthe British Military authorities.2. Ethiopia is temporarily under British Military guidance and control,because, pending the decisions of the Peace Conference, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are technically in the position of an Occupying Power.3. In areas notified by the Commander-in-Chief as areas occupied byBritish Military Forces, and these may change from time to time as the militarysituation demands, the political and administrative executive of the Com-mander-in-Chief will be the Deputy Chief Political Officer. Departmentalcontrol and administrative supervision on behalf of the War Office and HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be exercised through the Chief Political Officer,thus such areas will be under British Military Administration.4. When the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, considers that military occupation of an area may be dispensed with, such an area will be placed underthe authority of the Emperor, it being understood that should the situationdemand the Commander-in-Chief may require any such area to revert to purely british Administration. In administering these areas on behalf of the occupying power the Emperor must accept British guidance and control on pain of lossof our support. That guidance and control will be exercised through the deputy chief Political Officer and his staff at the centre and by political missionsattached to the lunperor&apos;s officials in the provinces. Legislation in these areas will be in the name of the Emperor or under cover of his proclamations but mustbe acceptable to the Deputy Chief Political Officer.5. Although as stated in paragraph 4 the Emperor will administer on behalfof the Occupying Power, it is important that his authority in the eyes of his own people should not be undermined.6. Communications between the Emperor and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill be sent through the Deputy Chief Political Officer to General Officer Com-manding who will transmit to Commander-in-Chief through Chief political officer.(b41/66)   130   5/41   w.o.p.   7691East in the last few days, it appears that the Commander-in-Chief may in facthave been forced by the march of events in. Ethiopia to initiate administrative arrangements already on the basis suggested in the draft telegram.I would, however, point out to my colleagues that it may not be easy todefend these proposals on any strictly logical line. I do not doubt that therewill be some pressure, both in Parliament and outside, to accord to the Emperorabsolute and unqualified recognition of his sovereign rights. Nevertheless I donot consider either that it is possible to do so or that we are bound to do in thelight of the Governments policy as declared by the Foreign Secretary on the4th February last.D.M.
