EJg R E. T.copy no.  WAR    CABINET.WAGES.Me^Q^adiim. by. ,the Lord President of..the Council,10      The Lord President&apos;sdraw the attention of the War Cabinetthe policy of price stabilisation set(Command 2694)  of last July.Committee think it necessary toto dangers now threateningout in the White Pacernations;The Agricultural Wagesminimum wage   of 60/- aBoard haveweek toscently awarded aworkers.agriculturalThe National Arbitration Tribunal is   now consideringclaims for substantial wage increases by the engineers and theshipbuilders,    The railwaymen have also put forward a claim fora minimum wage    of 60/- a week (exclusive of the war advance of11/-),      This claim is to be discussed by the Railway ExecutiveCommittee this week,  and a decision cannot be long delayed.    Theclaimsbefore the Arbitration Tribunal are likely to be decidedbefore Christmas,,3,.      We must assume that these applications will resultin some increases in wage rates.The recent increase in agricultural wages - thoughit is very large, averaging as much as-28/- a week - could perhaps be represented as the adjustment of a long-standinginequalitypand therefore as not inconsistent with the policy krjd downin the White Paper.    If,  however, increases are now granted tothe engineers, shipbuilders and railwaymen, there is danger ofits being assumed that these rates are being adjusted to thenew agricultural wage.    A new wage-cycle will have begun;    andapplications for corresponding increases will probably be made over a large cart of the industrial field.4a Up tobeen held. the at the cost, itExcheauer - and now,  the policy set out in the White Paper hasunward movement of prices has been checked -is true,  of substantial subsidies from the.the cost of living figure has been kept withinthe limitExche querset in the statement made by theintroducing his last Budget.    OnChancellor of the-the other sidevthouffh there has been a substantial increase in earnings, wage rates have not made by the Tr;risen disproportionately,ide Unions have not, on theHitherto,   the demandswhole, been unreasonable.

If, however,  the new wage-cycle which is now openingbrings substantial increases in wage rates over a wide field,the chances of maintaining our present policy of price stabilisation will be seriously jeopardised.    As an illustration,  an average increase in wages of 5/-- a weekv/ould add from  m, 100 to  m,. 150 to the national wages bill,A large part of the resulting increase in costs would fallon the Exchequer,  and this would add materially to ourBudgetary difficulties,,    But a more serious result would bethe risk that industrial costs would he raised to an extent -which would seriously threaten the policy of holding theoost of living.    The economic stability which we have maintained over the last nine months might thus be lost,  andthe inflationary spiral might be set  in motion,,5,      My Committee are satisfied that, while applicationsto the Arbitration Tribunal are still sub judice,  it wouldbe highly dangerous for the Government to make any newdeclaration of policy with the object of influencing theTribunal&apos; in its decision..If this   ?i.QW is accepted by the War Cabinet, then -notwithstanding the Budgetary difficulties and the risk tothe maintenance of the stabilisation policy - the applicationsnow outstanding must take their course,  and no attempt can bemade to prevent other applications within the same cycle from being considered on their merits,,6.      We should, however, make it our aim to be ready witha new wages policy,  which would arrest the inflationaryprocess,  to be applied as soon as the present wage-cycle hasbeen completed and in any event before next year&apos;s budget is introduced,,It would be appropriate that in the first instancethe Ministers primarily concerned,  should proceed now to formulate.,  for consideration by the War Cabinet,  proiposalsdesigned to enable the Government to deal with the situation as soon as the present series of wage-claims has been disposedJ.
