Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G) (41) 48,May 9, 1941.WAR CABINET.REPORT BY UNITED KINGDOM HIGH COMMISSIONER IN CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN continuation of my paper circulated as W.P. (G) (41) 45, I think thatthe appended report by Mr. Malcolm MacDonald of a further talk which he had with Mr. Mackenzie King after the latter&apos;s return to Ottawa from his visit to president Roosevelt will be of interest. In forwarding it to me Mr. MacDonaldwrites : &quot; I expect you are a bit exercised about the long-term political effects ofthese comings and goings between Mackenzie King and Roosevelt, though their results from the immediate point of view of waging the war are excellentand to be warmly recommended. My own reflections on all these developmentscan be stated quite briefly as follows : It is natural and inevitable that canada and the United States should come closer and closer together, onaccount of their geographical situation; it is to the general advantage ofthe English-speaking peoples and of the world that they should do so;nevertheless, it is undesirable that the effect of this should be any weakening of British sentiment in Canada and of her links with the BritishCommonwealth; the real danger of this comes from the propinquity of asmall nation of 11 million people with an enormously powerful nation of130 million, whose ideas and culture keep slopping over every day intoCanada; this process must be countered by the deliberate keeping alive ofBritish ideas and culture through visits of Canadians to Britain and someof the best British citizens to Canada; at present this work is being doneby the magnificent fortitude and heroism of the whole British people, which makes Canadians prouder than they have ever been before to be a member ofthe Commonwealth.&quot;C.May 9, 1941.I had a talk with Mr. Mackenzie King yesterday afternoon on his return from his week-end visit to President Roosevelt at Hyde Park.He told me the story of his conversations, first with Mr. Morgenthau andthen with Mr. Roosevelt, which ended in what the Prime Minister keeps inviting-future historians to call the Declaration of Hyde Park. When I think somewhatirreverently of all the declarations which have been made by one person to anotherunder the trees in that Hyde Park which comes first into the mind of a Londoner,I feel that the new pronouncement is in some ways quite in keeping with thoseothers. This is a declaration of love between Canada and the United States,and the bachelor Prime Minister, who acted as proxy for the Dominion whichis already married into the family of the British Commonwealth, is as proud andsmiling as any infatuated swain.[22506]
The Declaration contains the announcement of a quite handsome exchangeof dowries between the two parties, which is a valuable contribution to theproblems of war production and dollar exchanges here. The text of it is inLondon, so I need not expand upon its terms. Its substance was first discussed by Mr. Mackenzie King with Mr. Morgenthau; between that conversation andhis Sabbath meeting with the President, Mr. King got his colleague, Mr. Howe,and some of his advisers who were in Washington to draft the statement, andMr. King took this in his pocket for the talk with the President. In the courseof their talk he produced it; Mr. Roosevelt went through it, paragraph by paragraph, and accepted it; Mr. King read it then and there over the telephoneto Mr. Morgenthau, who approved; a number of copies were promptly typed, andMr. King asked the President whether he proposed that they should formallyappend their signatures to the document. Mr. Roosevelt said they need not botherto do that, but took out his pen and scrawled on the top copy &apos;&apos; Done by Mackenzieand F.D.R. on a lovely sunny day at Hyde Park.&quot; So the famous declaration was born.Each of the principal partners in this love affair seems to have played his part with skill. One result is a considerable strengthening of Mr. King&apos;sreputation as a Statesman in Canada, where this latest achievement is deservedlygreeted by the press and the public as something of a triumph. Though this development undoubtedly marks a further step in the close drawing together ofCanada and the United States, it will not mean any loosening of the tie of devotedloyalty binding Canada to the United Kingdom. In all parts of the Dominionthis sentiment is now intense and exceedingly warm. A &quot; rapprochement &quot;between the two North American countries is natural and inevitable, and is atpresent entirely consistent with the other relationship between the Dominion andthe British Commonwealth. I see no particular reason why this situation shouldalter to the disadvantage of the Commonwealth. It is just one important partof that process which Mr. Churchill described as the affairs of Britain and theUnited States getting somewhat mixed up together. But what the more distantfuture may bring is still inscrutable.I might interpose here that the &quot; getting together &quot; of Canadians and americans is a policy being deliberately pursued by many others than theCanadian Prime Minister. I have spent a good deal of time in the last two dayswith Canadian and American mayors, who are in conference together in Ottawa.Their mutual cordiality and their North American consciousness are very marked.But their principal topic of conversation outside the conference chamber is theirunqualified admiration for the heroic fight which the citizens of Britain aremaking in defence of North American liberties.Mr. Mackenzie King spent many pleasant hours with Mr. Roosevelt, sittingon the lawns in their shirt sleeves and driving out to visit some of the Presidentsneighbours and friends. Mr. King feels that the President is battling just now with some great difficulties over his plans to help Britain. There is a wave ofdefeatism sweeping through the States as a result of our defeats in the balkans and the setback in North Africa, which is embarrassing him. He told Mr. king of his plans to have a double patrol composed of ships and aeroplanes con-stantly working off the North American coast, and extending for 1,000 miles or so into the Atlantic and stretching &quot; almost as far as Iceland.&quot; When ourconvoys are in these waters the American patrol will, as it happens, circle roundand round the ships, and if they spy anything in the nature of an enemy they will&quot; shout.&quot; Mr. Roosevelt does not propose to make any formal announcement ofthis development, but just to let it leak out.Mr. King did not ask the President his views about full-blooded intervention by the United States in the war, for fear of embarrassing him; but he got theimpression that, barring an accident, the United States will not come into thewar at any early date. He thinks that the policy which the President still hasto conform to is to stay out of actual belligerent participation as long as possible.He believes that this is dictated to an appreciable extent by a consciousness ofunpreparedness, and thinks that the same reasons will influence the State Depart-ment in the direction of a policy of non-provocation to Japan. He expressedthese views to Lord Halifax, adding that he did not feel entirely confident ofthem and might be proved wrong.
He was immensely impressed by the anxiety not only of the President butalso of Mr. Hull, Mr. Morgenthau and Mr. Hopkins to aid Britain in every possible way.He told the President that he would like to let the public in the United Statesknow more about Canada&apos;s part in the war. He had refrained from anything which might be interpreted as propaganda whilst the Lend-Lease Bill was underdiscussion, but now wished to come himself, say, to the Canadian Club in new york City to make a speech explaining and extolling Canada&apos;s effort. ThePresident expressed sincere gratitude for Mr. King&apos;s reticence in the past, andwelcomed the idea of intensive instruction of the American public from now on.But he said that Mr. King should not make his address to the Canadian Club in new York; he should come and make it on the floor of Congress in Washington.M. M.Ottawa, April 24, 1941.
