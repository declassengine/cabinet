(THIS DOCUlviENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;secret.W.P.(G)(41) 88. COPY NO.U1st September, 1941.FAR     CABINETREFUSAL OF FIRMS ENGAGED ON GOVERNMENT WORK TO NEGOTIATEwrm trade unions.--Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.1.     The Minister of Labour has brought to the noticeof the Lord Presidents Committee the difficulties whichare developing owing to the refusal of certain firms toaccept the recognised practice of negotiating anddiscussing labour questions with traae unions representingtheir workpeople.   These difficulties become acute whenthe firm maintains its refusal in spite of recommendations made by courts of enquiry or similarly impartial tribunals.Examples are given in the Appendix to this memorandum.Though these cases are relatively few in number,the firms are often important individually;    and theMinister of Labour is satisfied that the maintenance ofindustrial peace will be seriously jeopardised unless -action is taken to bring these firms into line with thepractice generally recognised throughout industry.When compulsion is being applied to individual workpeople,it is unreasonable that the Government should have no power to enforce upon managements compliance with recommendations made after enquiry by an impartial tribunal.2.     The Minister of Labour has therefore suggestedthat powers should be taken to enforce compliance withsuch recommendations in proper cases,   The&quot;Lord presidents committee endorse this suggestion.The procedure proposed is that, when difficultiesof this kind arise, the Minister of Labour will continueto follow his present practice of trying first to arrive ata settlement by way of conciliation;     and, if this fails,he will consult the Supply Department concerned beforeappointing a court of enquiry.    On receiving the court&apos;sfindings, he will again consult the Supply department concerned and see whether action to give effect to thosefindings can be secured on a voluntary basis.   If,however, the two Ministers agree, after consultation,that the findings must be enforced compulsorily, a direction will be issued to the firm. &quot; In the event of disagreement between the two Ministers, the matter willbe referred to the Lord Presidents Committee before any direction is issued.   The directions will be given onbehalf of the Government by the Minister of Labour.- 1 -

5.     It is also contemplated that such directionsmay he given in appropriate cases, even though no courtof enquiry has been held, if the Minister of Labour orthe Supply Minister concerned considers that such actionought to be taken.   In these cases also, there will bethe same procedure of consultation between the two ministers&apos;, and reference to the Lord President&apos;s Committeein the event of disagreement, before any directions are issued.at the Meeting of the Lord President s Committee at whichthis question was considered;   and they are in agreementwith the procedure proposed.In view, however, of the importance of the issues involved, the Committee think it right to submit theseproposals to the War Gabinet for final approval.The Supply Miented,J.A.GREaT GEORGE STREET, S.V7.1.1st September, 1941.

APPENDIX.TRENT GUNS AND CARTRIDGES LIMITED,  GRTMSBY.Following complaints by the virorkpeople regarding their wages and theworking conditions, the National Union of General and Municipal Workerssucceeded in organising tho whole of tho female workers in this factory, and submitted an application for a mooting with tho firm to discuss various matters.     The firm refused to meet tho Union and resisted all attemptsmade by the Department to bring about joint negotiations.The trouble came to a hoad when a woman shop steward was dismissed anda number of the workpeople refused to return unless she was re-instated.Some of the v/orkpeople left tho Union and went back to work, but the firmrefused to take back others unless they left the Union.A Court of Inquiry was appointed by the Department, under theChairmanship of Sir Charles Doughty.     The Court found that the real causeof the dismissal of the woman shop steward was her activity as a TradeUnionist, and that the fundamental cause of the dispute was the stubbornrefusal of the managing director to have any dealings with any Trade Unions,and the active steps which he took to prevent if possible his workpeoplejoining the Union.Other conclusions of the Court were as follows:-&quot;We strongly regret the attitude of Mr. Claud King.     The Union didin fact acquire a membership of the overwhelming majority of tho workers andthe attitude of Mr. King was bound to lead to a trade dispute with greatpossibilities of a stoppage of work just as actually did happen in fact.Tho almost universal practice and well-tried method of recognising andnegotiating with the Trade Union or Unions fairly representing the workers should be adopted in those Works and unless it is adopted we fear othertroubles will arise.Wo appreciate that Mr. King is quite sincere in his belief that ho is entitled to refuse to have any dealings with a Trade Union and he claims that if he likes he is entitled to run his works on ncn-Union lines.     Inpeace time if he chooses to try to exercise this right and a trade disputeoccurs in consequence the National Interest may not be gravely involved.In war time wo think that however strongly individuals may desire to runtheir works in their own way, it is their duty to their country to fall into line with the vast majority of other good employers and assist theGovernment in the accepted methods of conciliation&quot;..In this case the position vras aggravated because the wages paidby the firm were relatively low.     This matter was the subject of an awardby the National. Arbitration Tribunal which gave the workers wages equal tothose fixed by the Stamped and Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board which were considerably in excess of the rates of wages in operation at the time of the stoppage.

RICHARD THOMAS AND COMPANY LBCETED, SOUTH WALES.In 1939, The National Association of Clerical and Supervisory Staffs, a subsidiary of the Transport and General Tforlv^jsliiion made an approach toRichard Thomas and Company for recognition on the grounds that a   number ofthe Company&apos;s clerical staff in the   Vfest y/alos Yforlcs had been organised bythe Association,     Tho reply of the Company was to the effect that they didnot consider the intervention of the Association between the Company and thestaff concerned would serve any useful purpose.     The Association would not accept this reply as a settlement of their claim for recognition and theAssociation reported the difference between the Company and itself to theMinistry of Labour.     Efforts made by officers of the Ministry of Labour tobring about an understanding between the parties were not successful.T/hen tho Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order 1940came into force the Association reported a dispute with the Company to theMinistry of Labour and National Service.     Efforts made by officers of theMinistry of Labour to bring about a settlement between the parties and thereby avoid reference of the dispute to the National Arbitration Tribunaly/ero not successful.     The chief obstaole to any settlement was thodetermination of the Company not to recognise the Association.Tho Tribunal had no xoower to decide whether the Company should recognise theAssociation;     therefore the Award did not settle the difference regardingrecognition.     Scales of salaries wore drawn up by tho Company as directed inthe Award but without any consultation with the Association.     The Associationthen reported a further dispute to the Ministry of Labour under the Order.At this juncture a dispute arose at the Llanelly 7/orks over the suspension by the Company of a member of the Association for allegedinsubordination.     Tho local Directors of tho Company refused to receive a deputation from the Association to discuss the circumstances of thosuspension!.     A strike of clerical workers, members of the Association commencedon Monday, 24th March, 1941 ond the local Branch of the Association then decided that full recognition of their Association would be a condition of any settlement.     The strike of clerical workers continued and the strike extendedto thousands of manual workers in the tinplate works and in the steel works,notwithstanding that at an informal meeting between a Conciliation Officer ofthe Ministry of Labour, representatives of Richard Thomas and Company Limited,representatives of the National Association of Clerical and Supervisory staffs and of the Transport and General 7/orkers Union, held in London on 27th March 194:1,an understanding was arrived at os follows:-1.     That an immediate resumption of work shall take place*2*     That the question of Trade Union recognition shall not be made acondition-3.     That Mr. Lewis will receive Mr. XhR. Thomas immediately and that theywill make their own arrangements regarding Mr. Thomas1 return to work.The strike was not officially recognised by the Association.     A NationalOffioer of the Association brought about a resumption of work.The Association hoped that the Company would give favourable considerationto the question of recognition.     There was not, however, any change in theattitude of the Company over the question of recognition^     It was thenalleged by the Association that pressure was being brought to boor upon membersof the clerical staff to join a staff guild known as &quot;Richard Thomas and CompanyLimited and Subsidiary Companies Staff Association (&quot;,7est Wales xlrea)&quot;.     It was alleged by the Association that this was bringing about serious unrest.     further efforts were made by the Ministry of Labour to bring about an understanding witha view to any risk of further unofficial stoppages of work being removed but these efforts wore unsuccessful.     In view of the fact that this failure toreach a settlement might cause interference with work of national importance theMinister of Labour and National Scrvioe referred the matter to a Court of Inquiryunder the Industrial Courts Act 1919.

t.The Court of Inquiry reported on 30th Juno, 1941 as follows.(i) We arc satisfied that a substantial numbGr of the clerical andsupervisory Staff employed by Richard Thomas and Company limited in their West Wales Works have joined and wish to retain their membership of the National Association of Clerical and SupervisoryStaffs,(ii) We consider that Richard Thomas and Company Limited has not been ableto sustain its objection to the recognition of the national association of Clerical and Supervisory Staffs on the ground that theAssociation cannot be differentiated from the Transport and general works Unions(iii) We cannot regard the Staff Guild instituted by the Company as providing adequate machinery fear free and collective negotiation between the Company and its staff.(iv) We can find no evidenoe that undue pressure and/or inducement hasbeen exercised to persuade individuals to join the Staff Guildbut in our opinion the attempt to set up such an organisation at atime when the whole question of negotiating machinery and procedure was under consideration is unfortunate and can only have a harmfuleffect on the relations between the Company and Organised labour.This report is at present under consideration but the Ministry of Labourhave no powers to enforce adoption by the parties.FORD MOTOR COMPANY, DAGENHAM AND MANCHESTER.This Company has always followed the practice of its parent Company inAmerica of refusing to recognise Trade Unions and despite the payment of high rates of wages this attitude has been a constant source of irritation to TradeUnions.     (it may be noted that under pressure of war conditions, Fords ofAmerica have reoently agreed to give full recognition),In recent months trouble with the firm has been reported to theMinistry of Labour by both the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Clericaland Administrative Y/orkers Union.     The Amalgamated Engineering Union reported the refusal of the firm to register the introduction of trainees, as dilutees,into the tool-room as a departure from trade praotice and also to discuss the dismissal of one of their shop stewards in circumstances in which victimisationwas alleged.     The Clerical and Administrative Workers Union reported a difficulty about the dismissal of one of their members who is said by themanagement to have been found unsuitable, but is alleged by the Union to havebeen dismissed mainly because of trade union activities.     In all these oasesI   feelings have been aroused because the firm have definitely refused to discussthe matter with the Union representatives.     It is probable that active disputeshave only been avoided over these questions because it was made known to theUnions that this Department was dealing with the wider and more important issueof recognition.Representations have been made by the Department to the Ministry of aircraft production that they should consider seriously the position of Fords inrespect of their attitude towards Trade Unions, and the Minister decided not toschedule the firm under the Essential Work Order until the position had been cleared up.     The Company has been informed by the Ministry of Aircraft production as to the wishes of the Government on the matter, but they have not departedfrom their attitude and although a Government owned faotory they are managing to resist carrying out the policy desired by the Government.IThe view of the Ministry of Labour is that it is impossible to press on private employers the recognition of Trade Unions, if this principle is notcarried out in Government-owned factories, and that as a serious dispute islikoly to occur at any time it is essential that action should be taken withoutdelay to determine the position.-D-

The case of Fords is important &quot;because their attitude has affected other firms, such as Briggs Motor Bodies - referred to &quot;below, - and Kelsey HayesWheel Company of Dagenham, and a settlement here will strengthen the hands ofthe Ministry of Labour and of the Supply Departments in dealing with anyother firms who refuse to fall in line with accepted policy.BRIGGS MOTOR BODIES LIMITED, DAGBNHAM.This firm is ocnmeroially associated with Fords and has foUcrod the policyof that Company in refusing to recognise Trade Unions.    Early in May theDepartment was informed that owing to the dismissal of a shop steward there was serious danger of an interruption of work.     A Court of Inquiry, with sir Charles Doughty as Chairman, was appointed, and in the course of the Inquiryagreement was reached, which resolved tho immediate dispute.One clause of the Agreement was as follows&quot;The Company is prepared in the case of its employees in the engineeringdivision to permit engineering division employees to elect from their numberstheir own representatives to negotiate on their behalf with the Management ofthe Company or their representative. The Management or their representativewill moot such representatives of the engineering division to consider theprocedure to be adopted for such negotiations and to define tho position and responsibilities of elected representatives&quot;.In its report the Court stated that in its opinion if an agreed scheme forthe discussion and settlement of all such difficulties were in operation, suchmatters as this dispute could be dealt with speedily and amicably and would be unlikely to cause serious unrest.They noted that while the management did in fact deal with their ownemployees who were known to be members of a Union, they had no dealings with theoffioials of the Union, unless they were also employed by the firm.    they expressed the view that if the usual procedure adopted by firms who are partiesto common agreements with the appropriate Unions could have been adopted inthis case, no trouble would have arisen.The Court added:&quot;In large works misunderstandings and sometimes even injustices may occur, and we recommend that this Company should adopt the normal procedure for discussing and settling disputes which necessarily involves the recognition of those Unions who fairly and largely represent their workpeople&quot;.Although action has been taken on the report no satisfactory arrangements have yet been made but tho Company has informed the Minister that they couldchange their attitude to general recognition of the Unions only if they aregiven a direction to that effect.He.
