MEASURES FOR REGULATING RESIGNATIONS FROMTHE HOME GUARD:    REACTIONS ON PART-time civil DEFENCE PERSONNEL.Memorandum by. the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security.Whatever decision the Cabinet reach as to the right ofexisting members of the Home Guard to resign on giving a- fortnight&apos;s: notice, it is bound to affect the position ofthe existing part-time civil defence volunteers.2.     The theroretical liability to service of part-time civil defence Volunteers is unlimited?   in practice the-unwritten obligation is to give not less than 48 hours&apos;service per month but a part-time volunteer can resign.- without notice at any moment.5*.    The Home Guard supplements the regular military force.The part-time civil defence volunteers in many areas,however, constitute the only civil defence services:    in nearly all areas the services could not function without the contribution made by part-timers.4.     It is. therefore, essential that I should not be facedwith the possibilities of resignations on a large scale.5.     The wastage amongst part-time civil defence volunteersis increasing by reason of the calling up of men for the armed forces and soon, therefore, it may be necessary toask existing part-time volunteers .to increase the number of hours oi duty to: 48 per month where fewer are now given.6.,    I had realised that this situation might lead toresignations on a.larger scale than was safe and, shortly before the introduction of the National Service (No. 2)Bill, 1941, I had contemplated the &quot;freezing&quot;, under proper safeguards, of the remaining part-time volunteers.7.     I Still feel that this measure is necessary.. 8.     I asJ? my colleagues to agree that, concurrently withthe announcement of the decision in regard to the Home Guards,I should be authorised to announce that steps will be takento &quot;freeze&quot; the existing part-time civil defence personnelsubject to the right of appeal to a hardship tribunal by anymember&apos;who is refused leave to resign by the officer in chargeof his Service,But I realise that there may be difficulties if thereare.separate arrangements for the Home Guard and for part-time volunteers In civil defence.WAR &apos; CABINET.H.M,HOME OFFJQE.16th December 1941.
