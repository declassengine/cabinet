r-(\ October 1941.WAR CABINET.Prolongation of Parliament Bill, 1941.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.The War Cabinet on the 1st September, when approving theproposal that a Bill should be introduced to extend the duration of the present Parliament for a further year, agreed that in thecourse of debates on the Bill the assurance given in 1940 mightbe repeated, to the effect that an opportunity would be given fordiscussion of questions connected with changes in our electoralsystem before a general election takes place.The Bill is down for Second Reading on Tuesday next and Iunderstand that representations are likely to be made in the debate that steps ought to be taken without delay to explorecertain questions which will have to be considered before anygeneral election takes place.     First, it will be represented that before an election takes place there must be a new register,that the preparation of such a register takes a long time, andthat a situation may arise in which it is most desirable tohold an election speedily but the machinery for an election maybe lacking.     It will therefore be argued that some enquiry should be made now for the purpose of devising suitablemachinery to enable an election to be held quickly if and whenah election becomes desirable.      Secondly, it may berepresented that some plan should be prepared beforehand fordealing with tho problem of redistribution.     Thirdly, it maybe represented that steps should be taken without delay forexploring certain questions of electoral reform so that Parliamentmay be in a position whenever an election is imminent to decide whether certain changes in the electoral system shall beintroduced before an election takes place.      It is doubtfulhow far the Chair will allow discussion on all or any of thesematters but I think it desirable to bring them to the notice ofthe War Cabinet so that if those questions should be debated Imay be in a position to indicate the attitude of the Government.1. The registration machinery.      Under the existing system which entails the publication of lists, the entertaining ofobjections and so on, the preparation of a register of electorscovers a period of some five months.     War conditions have resulted in large scale shiftings of the population, and at theend of the war it may be expected that numbers of people will gradually move bark from their war-time habitations to their previous places of residence or to some other places.     If a register were to be compiled while this shifting is in process,the result might be that many people would be registered in places which they are abeUtto leave and consequently would be,when the election took place, unable to vote because they would find themselves at the time of the election living at some long distance from the place in which they were registered.     this consideration and other practical problems raise the questionwhether.in place of the existing system of electoral registrationsome other system might be devised based for example on the
National Registration Cards, with a provision for distinguishingthe cards of those of electoral age from the remainder.I think therefore there is much to be said for setting on foot at an early date an enquiry as to the possibility of devising some electoral machinery of which swift use could bemade if and when an election becomes imminent.2.      It might also be desirable that some enquiry should be madewith a view to settling,the principles on which any scheme of redistribution should be based and the machinery for carrying it into effect, so that if when an election is imminent it were decided that there must be redistribution before an electiontakes place, there may be in existence a scheme for effecting itI have considered what would be - the most appropriate body for conducting an enquiry into these two matters, namely,.themachinery for enabling an election to take place and themachinery for giving effect to a scheme of redistribution, and Iwould suggest that they might, properly be explored by a departmental Committee containing Parliamentary representatives,official experts and others who are acquainted with the practice,problems.3. As regards any questions of electoral reform,  the precedentcreated by the Speaker!s Conference of 1916/17 is hardlyapplicable today when the questions of electoral reform whichare likely to be raised are by no means so far reaching as thosewhich were raised in 1916.     The questions likely to be raisedare proportional representation and the alternative vote, theabolition of plural voting, alterations of the law with regardto the use of motor vehicles and possibly the question whether there should be some extension of postal voting.      I feelconsiderable doubt whether it is justifiable at the present timewhen attention must necessarily be concentrated on war problems to make any arrangement for the examination of these questions.The argument for entering upon an examination of the questionsof machinery for enabling an election to take place is that the postponement of this examination may result in a position inwhich it is impracticable to hold an election without a long delay however desirable it may be to have an election quickly:consequently even at the present date when attention to warproblems must have the first place,  there is a case for devotingtime to the examination of these questions.   . The same argumentcannot be applied to questions of franchise reform.     Howeverdesirable some of these changes, may be thought to be by some sections of the electors, It cannot be said that failure to effect such changes would make it impracticable to hold an election likely to result in the return of a House of Commonswhich is tolerably representative of the nation.H.M.HOME OFFICE.3rd October 1941.
