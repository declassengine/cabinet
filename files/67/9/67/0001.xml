Printed for the War Cabinet.   Jidy 1941.SECRET.W.P. (G) (41) 67.July 15, 1941.WAR CABINET.PROPOSAL TO POSTPONE ELECTIONS TO INDIAN provincial legislatures AND BURMA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES :AMENDMENT OF INDIA AND BURMA ACTS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India and- for Burma.UNDER Section 61 of the Government of India Act and Section 18 of theGovernment of Burma Act, the Legislative Assemblies of the Indian provinces and the House of Representatives in Burma are automatically dissolved at theexpiration of 5 years from the date of their first meeting. This period in thecase of five of the eleven Provinces expires in April, and in the case of theremainder in July next. Thus, in the normal course it would be necessary tohold elections in the near future in these five Indian Provinces and in Burma.The Governor-General considers that to hold elections in India this winter wouldinvolve interruption of war work, and that, in the present communal tension, todo so would menace the peace of the country and encourage subversive activity.Moreover, it would be a source of embarrassment to Provincial administrationswere they compelled to hold the elections at a time when the Congress Party are engaged in a campaign of Civil Disobedience which takes the form of advocatingnon-co-operation in India&apos;s participation in the war. Many of the principalCongress provincial politicians are at present undergoing imprisonment, and ademand would arise for wholesale releases. The Congress Party would use theelections as an opportunity for advocating non-participation in the war effort and the Provincial Governments would be compelled to take action against the speakers under the Defence of India regulations. In those Provinces (Bengal,Punjab, Assam, Sind) where Ministries remain in office, it would clearly bedifficult for Ministers to do this without being accused, of silencing their ownpolitical opponents. In all Provinces a great strain would be put upon the Policeat a time when military support is much below normal.The view that Provincial Assembly elections should be postponed is supportedby the Governors of all Provinces but one and by the Chief Ministers of three ofthe four Provinces where Ministries remain in office. It is supportedunanimously by the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council. The only dissentients are theGovernor of Bengal and his Chief Minister, both of whom are opposed to the post-ponement of the Bengal election. The Governor of Bengal admits the danger ofcommunal friction, but considers that this will arise at whatever time an electionhas to be held. He anticipates that there will be serious agitation by the Hinducommunity if they are faced with the prospect of the present Ministry, which hasbeen frequently accused of anti-Hindu bias, remaining in power for an indefinite period. He also points out that the all-India Moslem League are understood tobe, and the Hindu Mahasabha is definitely, in favour of elections at the normaltime, and urges that, as opinion is increasingly in favour of early constitutional advance for India, the postponement of elections until the post-war period may result in the chief political parties then refusing to participate in elections underthe present Constitution, and will strengthen the demand for an electedConstituent Assembly.[22716]Copy No.O i
2. The Governor-General has no doubt that, from the point of view of India-as a whole, the balance of advantage strongly favours postponement of elections to all Provincial Assemblies notwithstanding the probable unpopularity of such adecision among politicians of almost all shades of opinion. He proposes, and I agree with his recommendation, that the Government of India Act should be amended to postpone the date on which the present Legislative Assemblies areautomatically dissolved until 12 months after the end of the war, but to leaveintact the Governors discretionary power to dissolve before that date. This, ofcourse, would enable elections to be held in Bengal or any other Province should situation arise in which that course appeared desirable. The extension for12 months after the war is necessary because climatic conditions limit the period within which elections can be held in India, and the time of year at which theend of the war &quot; will come cannot be foretold.3. It is not considered necessary to take similar action in respect of Legisla-tive Councils in the six Provinces where these Second Chambers exist, as the nextelections to these bodies are not due until 1943, and only one-third of the members will then be required to retire.4. In the case of the Central Legislative Assembly and Council of State, Ihave agreed with the Governor-General&apos;s recommendation, in which his ExecutiveCouncil concur, that the period of life of both bodies, which were elected in 1934and 1936 for three and five years respectively, should be extended under hisstatutory powers for a further period of twelve months, that is, up to October1942.5. Similar constitutional provisions to those in force for Indian ProvincialAssemblies apply to the House of Representatives in Burma. Sir ReginaldDorman-Smith is, however, of opinion that it is desirable that elections should beheld at the normal time, if this is possible, since in Burma communal considera-tions are not present to the same extent as in India. The possibility that the burma elections may be used as an opportunity for anti-British and anti-warpropaganda has been considered, and at first the view of the Prime Minister of burma was that it would not be possible for him to deal with such propaganda during an election. Subsequently he revised this opinion and is now prepared toremain in office during the election and to accept responsibility for enforcing thelaw on this subject where necessary. In a recent by-election in Burma it was not found that opposition speakers were disposed to court arrest by making anti-warspeeches, and the Governor recommends that the elections should be held unlessthe war situation in the Far East should so develop that this wrould be undesirable.I therefore propose that an amendment to the Government of Burma Act on thesame lines as that proposed to the Government of India Act should be includedin the proposed Bill, but that the Governor of Burma should simultaneouslyannounce that this does not necessarily imply that the House of representatives will not be dissolved this year.6. As the preliminary arrangements for these elections in Burma and in five of the eleven Indian Provinces would normally begin in September, thepassage of the proposed legislation is somewhat urgent.L.
