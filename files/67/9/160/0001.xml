I suggest that it should be by way of question and Answer in the House.QUESTION;To ask the Minister of Labour and National Service if he can now make any statement about the intention of the Government regardingfurther measures for the rehabilitation, training and employment of all categories of disabled persons.ANSWER:&quot;The Interim war-time scheme which I announced on 23rd October, 1941is progressing satisfactorily and the Government have now decided inprinciple on two further developments.First, as xin immediate war-time measure, they propose to provide forthe rehabilitation and training for employment of disabled persons whoare not provided for by the interim scheme.Second, they have decided to prepare as soon as possible comprehensivemeasures for the rehabilitation, training and resettlement of disabled persons generally, for introduction as soon as possible after the end ofthe war.Both these schemes will make provisions for disabled persons of all categories, irrespective of the cause of their disability.The Minister without Portfolio and I are now engaged, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, in an active investigation into thebest means of carrying these decisions into effect&quot;.All the Ministers concerned concur in the terms of the paper.E.
