THE Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has been appointed resident minister of Cabinet rank at Singapore for Far Eastern Affairs. He will serve under and report directly to the War Cabinet, through its Secretary.2. The Chancellor of the Duchy will preside over a War Council, whichwill consist of The Governor of the Straits Settlements,The Commander-in-Chief, Far East,The Naval Commodore,The Air Officer Commanding,The General Officer Commanding,The Director of Propaganda for the Far East.The Officer Commanding Australian Troops will be invited to attendwhen he is in Singapore, and will be informed when matters affecting Australia are to be discussed.(The addition of other members to the Council may later be foundnecessary.)[23253]
3. The limits of the geographical sphere within which the Chancellor ofthe Duchy will operate will coincide with the geographical sphere of the military commander-in-Chief. In practice, however, in the present situation theChancellor of the Duchy&apos;s activities are likely to be mainly confined to Malaya.4. The principal task of the Chancellor of the Duchy will be to assist thesuccessful conduct of operations in the Far East (a) by relieving the Commanders-in-Chief as far as possible of thoseextraneous responsibilities with which they have hitherto beenburdened, and(b) by giving them broad political guidance.5. The Chancellor of the Duchy&apos;s functions will also include the settlementof emergency matters on the spot, where time does not permit of reference home.He will develop a local clearing-house for the prompt settlement of minor routinematters which would otherwise have to be referred to separate Departments athome. On all matters on which he requires special guidance he will, providedthere is time, refer the matter home. He will in any case report constantly toHis Majesty&apos;s Government.6. Similarly, while expenditure remains the responsibility of the appropriate minister at home and departmental representatives on the spot concerned withexpenditure will work under existing delegated powers, referring home to their departments as may be necessary, the Chancellor of the Duchy is authorised toact at his own discretion by giving overriding authority to departmental officers to incur expenditure when satisfied that urgent action is necessary and that thereis no time to refer home. He will then immediately report the action which hasbeen taken. Such action will rarely be necessary where large financial commitments are involved.7. The appointment of the Chancellor of the Duchy does not, of course, inany way impair the existing responsibilities of the Commanders-in-Chief, or his Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the Far East, or their official relationships withtheir respective Departments at home, with whom they will continue to correspond direct.8. The Chancellor of the Duchy will take steps to establish liaison withthe Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia and of New Zealand.9. The Chancellor of the Duchy is being asked to submit a report as soonas sufficient experience of the working of the system has been gained. Inparticular he will report on the scope and geographical sphere of the functions which he can usefully perform in present circumstances.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,December 12, 1941&quot;.
