Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET.W.P. (G) (41) 110.October 13, 1941.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON VISIT TO NATAL.Note by Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I EEEL bound, in view of the Prime Ministers comments on Lord Ffarleelisviews regarding Natal, to pursue the matter a little further. For one thing, i feel that, quite unintentionally, I have been somewhat unfair to the HighCommissioner in circulating only a portion of his despatch. I did so because it seemed unnecessary to burden my colleagues with the whole of a long document,much of which wras concerned with matters of detail. But I feel that I must emphasise that, taken as a whole, the despatch pays a tremendous tribute to the loyalty and enthusiasm of the people of Natal, and I am quite sure that LordHarlech would agree whole-heartedly with the Prime Minister in what he sayson this point. Clearly, it is of the first importance that devotion to the OldCountry should continue to guide and inspire the British peoples in the Dominions.But it is none the less true that South Africa presents a somewhat differentproblem from New Zealand and the Rhodesias, to which the Prime Ministerrefers. They, so far as the white population is concerned, are purely Britishcommunities. South Africa is not. By the South Africa Act of 1909 we created a new nation, of mixed parentage. It is essential, if this nation is not permanentlyto be rent by internal strife, that the British inhabitants should collaborate withthe Dutch, that they should regard themselves not only as British, but also asSouth African. It is with regard to this particular aspect that not only LordHarlech and others who have had the opportunity of paying numerous visits tothe Union during recent years, but also shrewd observers in the Union itself,see cause for anxiety as to the future.As the Prime Minister himself very truly points out, the Dutch have practically monopolised the whole Civil Service of the Cape Colony, OrangeFree State and Transvaal. He might have added, the political leadership, too.Who do we hear of in South African politics to-day ? Smuts, Maian, Hertzog,Havenga, Hofmeyr, Strydom. There are a few exceptions, such as ColonelStallard and Mr. Stuttaford. But they are not men of the first rank. And whyis this ? Largely because the British population in these territories adopt thesame detached attitude as the people of Natal. Lord Harlech indeed surely hitsthe nail exactly on the head when he says that the British population in the Uniontend to be introvert. The great tragedy of South Africa at the present time isthat they do not play their part, but abandon the field to the Dutch. He would see them spread British influence throughout the Union, and leaven the wholelump. That is not a defeatist view. It is essentially constructive, and it provides,in my view, the only hope of maintaining the Union within the British Empire.Were Ulster ever to be amalgamated with Southern Ireland, we should not wishUlstermen to hold aloof from the central Government. We should wish them toplay a leading part. I submit that our interest is, and must be, the same inSouth Africa.c:Dominions Office, October 13, 1941.[23009]Copy No.oK3
