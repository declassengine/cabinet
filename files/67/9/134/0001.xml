THE MAN-POWER POSITION IN CIVIL DEFENCE : THE national fire SERVICE AND OTHER CIVIL DEFENCE SERVICES, THEPOLICE AND THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH MISCELLANEOUSSERVICES.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.(A) National Fire Service.THE Fire Service has to be prepared to deal with air raid fires occurringat any point, in numbers which may be very large in comparison with peace-timeexperience, and without any opportunity to make dispositions in advance of theraids. Moreover, the scale of attack has been so great in many places, in comparison with the local fire-fighting resources which have actually beenprovided, or which it would be practicable to provide, that mutual reinforcementhas necessarily become an essential part of the organization, and this means that heavy calls may be made on any area to provide major fighting units and/orcrews to assist in other areas which are hard pressed.2. Since the heavy raids of last winter and spring, the arrangements fordealing with incendiary bombs by means of hand appliances have been much improved; but in the Home Office estimates of the fire brigade appliances requiredallowance was made for large-scale operations of this kind, and the equipmentwas planned according to the larger fires likely to be encountered. In any heavy-attack there are bound to be many fires which cannot be handled by fire parties and some which assume serious proportions almost instantaneously. Moreover,fire parties necessarily work under serious handicaps in case of combined attackwith high-explosive as well as incendiary bombs; they would be able to accomplishlittle or nothing if the enemy should develop the use of large, as against light,incendiary bombs, and whilst there has been no experience of heavy raiding sincethe compulsory orders were made, past experience does indicate that fire watching;is liable to fall off seriously if air raids are repeated one night after another..Making full allowances for all that oan be done with hand appliances, there is nothing to show that the scale on which tlhe Fire Service has been planned couldbe reduced on this account, especially having regard to the proved inadequacy ofthe resources to meet the concentrated attacks of last winter and spring. In anycase, even if it should prove possible to reduce the equipment, this would affectthe light pumps and part-time personnel rather than the major equipment andwhole-time strengths.3. The need for additional man (and woman) power in the National fire service (as in other civil defence services) depends, of course, on the demands forwhich the Service must be prepared. Hitherto, the general direction has been tobe prepared for heavy air attack. As to the scale of preparation to be made,there is the experience of last autumn, winter and spring to build upon, and thepresent objective is to make good the deficiencies which then became apparent.If there are any new factors to be taken into account, as bearing on the weight orform of attack which may be expected, I should be prepared to consider the[23178] &quot; this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.SECRET. Copy No.  71WvP. (G) (41) 134.November 21, 1941.WAR CABINET.
situation of all civil defence services in the light of these new. factors, but atpresent the Department knows of no reason to suppose that the risk of heavy andconcentrated attacks is at an end, or can be discontinued.4. Experience to date has shown that the Fire Service equipment, as planned and provided, would, if fully manned, be sufficient to enable the Fire Service to cope with any fire situations likely to arise in a heavy raid, provided the bombingis widely distributed. i.e., not heavily concentrated at any one place. But heavyconcentration of attack has generally been the enemy&apos;s policy hitherto, and heavyraids, if concentrated beyond a certain point, present the local Fire Services withan almost insuperable problem, in the shape of a multiplicity of fires which haveto be dealt with under handicaps such as shattered water supplies and telephonecommunications and blocked roads, which not only restrict the fire-fightingoperations but involve the use of additional equipment and man-power.5. In the heavy raids of last autumn much of the fire loss was a directconsequence of difficulties of this kind and was not preventable, but much was due to : (a) Operational weaknesses, attributable in large measure to the ultra-localbasis of the Fire Service organisation.(b) Shortage of man-power, by reason of which a large number of pumpscould not be manned, especially in London (where at least 1.000 majorpumps were without crews) and in some of the other target areas.6. The operational weaknesses are in process of being rectified by there organisation of the Fire Service on a national basis. Just as air army recruitedon a battalion basis is organised in larger formations. Brigades, Divisions,Corps, &amp;c. so a National Fire Service created out of a large number of smallindependent units must be organised in corresponding formations, each with anadequate operational and administrative staff.Man-power requirements (whole-time).7. To meet the man power shortage, the National Service Act was passed,and applications have been made to the Man-power Committee for allocations of whole-time personnel under this Act as follows:  Englandand Wales. Scotland.      Total.For period to 30th June,1941       .........       15.500 1,000         16,500For   period   1st  July   to^ 30th September. 1941 ...      20,000 2.500         22.500For future requirements toJune, 1942       ......      15,000 2,500         17,50056.500a total of 56,500 men in all. as against which only about 14,300 men have beenposted, leaving a balance of 42.200. The figures for the period to 30th Septemberlast were calculated on the basis of the number required to make up the crewsfor the major emergency pumps. &amp;c, i.e., on the assumption that the regularfire brigade pumps would be manned, more or less, by the then available fire brigade personnel. The figures for the further period to June 1942 were (a) formanning the additional heavy equipment then in process of being provided forthe protection of the Atlantic ports and some other target areas, (b) for theformation of salvage squads (to work with the Fire Service for safeguardingfood, &amp;c. against fire and water damage) and (c) for replacing naval personnel in the event of the Fire Service taking over the protection of the Naval Dockyardsand other establishments. No specific provision was made for wastage, as these losses had been fairly closely balanced by voluntary recruitment up to the timewhen the estimates were framed.8. The most important requirement is to have crews for the major units andthe special appliances which are essential in major fire fighting operations. Thesecrews must consist mainly of whole-time men because part-time men cannot, as a rule, leave their home districts,  and under the Fire Services  (Emergency
Provisions) Act they cannot be compelled to do so against their will. Apart fromthis consideration, the number of part-time firemen is far below the number required to man the light pumps (which are of vital importance for the local firefighting work) and, as a result, there are now at least 5,000 pumps, includingprobably 2,000 major pumps, for which it is impossible to find crews, even after an alert. Further losses of part-time personnel seem unavoidable in the courseof the next few months, by reason of the calling up of the higher age groups, the registration for Employment Order and the demands of industry either for industrial employment or fire watching.9.   The main man-power requirements can be summarised as follows :  England and Wales.Pump crews (for over 10,000 major pumps)      ...       ... 90.000Crews for special appliances and other heavy equipment(turntable ladders, hose-laying lorries, mobile waterunits, repair vans, pipe-line units, &amp;c.)      ...       ... 16,750Officers (Section Leader and upwards)    ...       ...       ... 10.100Administrative Staff (37 Fire Force and 210 DivisionalHeadquarters) and Miscellaneous    ...       ...       ... 1,900Repairs and maintenance   ...       ...      ...       ...       ... 2,100120.850Scotland.(Corresponding figures, based on 1,000 pumps) ...       ...      12,100Present strengths (1st November. 1941) England and Wales     ...       ...... 96.300Scotland ............ 7,000132.950103.300Balance required ...       ...       ...      29.650Additional for special appliances and heavy equipment issued or being issued     ...       ...       ...        5.00034.650Some deduction &quot;can be mad&apos;1 for pumps temporarily &quot; off the run,&quot; e.g., underoverhaul or repair, but the net number of men required to make up the crews willnot be less than 30,000. It should be explained that this figure represents a revised calculation of the numbers required to provide crews for the majorappliances now available or in process of being provided for certain target areas,based on ascertained National Fire Service requirements, whereas the originalapplications were furnished before the local authorities&apos; appliances had beentaken over, and were necessarily based on rough estimates only. The figure also includes the whole of the officers and staff of the Fire Forces and constituentformations in which the 1,500 or so Fire Brigades are being organised anentirely new requirement which had no counterpart in the Fire Servicepreviously and no special allowance is made for the salvage squads. There isstill no provision for wastage or for completing the crews of the fire brigadeappliances which have been taken over (which would in itself have called for,000 men or more). Moreover, the present estimate assumes the general adoptionof the continuous duty system (48 hours on and 24 hours off duty), which, however,it will not be possible to operate generally until far more accommodation can bemade available. Generally, the figures represent a careful and conservative estimate of the whole-time man-power requirements for the Fire Service, as atpresent constituted, up to June 1942.10. There are no sufficient data available at present for an accurate estimateof wastage, which varies a great deal from area to area and depends a good dealon the number of casualties and the other results of heavy air raiding. But. onthe data at present available, and assuming a measure of heavy air raiding, it isestimated that not less than 10,000 men will be required to replace wastage to the30th June next.   It is worth noting that there is at present a substantial loss of[23178] b 2
personnel to the Armed Forces, and, if this continues, it will be necessary totake it into account in the provision to be made for future wastage. It may prove possible to balance wastage to some extent by recruitment of women, but the stateof recruitment of women affords no such prospects of this kind at present.11. The possibility of making up some of the shortage of man-power &apos;bycalling on military and Air Force personnel, and factory fire brigades, has beenexplored in consultation with the appropriate Departments, with the result thatthere seems a good prospect of putting to good use, locally, some of the light pumpswhich cannot at present be manned by National Fire Service personnel, but no prospect whatever of any assistance from these sources for manning the majorpumps and augmenting the units available for reinforcing duty, which is themost serious shortage in the present Fire Service situation. The War Officerepresent that fire training (say, three weeks) and the combined exercises with the fire Service, which would be essential for efficiency, would interfere too seriouslywith Army training, or depot or operational duties, and that the withdrawal ofcrews for reinforcing or other fire fighting duties for several days at a time (apossibility which would have to be faced in case of the renewal of heavy air attacks) would also be a serious embarrassment. The same point of view was expressed, perhaps even more emphatically, on behalf of the Air Ministry; andthe Supply Departments considered that the withdrawal of factory fire brigadepersonnel, to the extent that would be necessary in order to relieve the Fire service to any useful degree, would involve far too serious risks to establishments whichare in themselves vital to the war effort of the country.12. It is clear that either personnel must be made available from somesource to the numbers which have been indicated, or equipment which is available and necessary to meet heavy raiding conditions must remain unmanned. Pumpswithout crews are as useless as guns or warships would be without theirs. all our experience goes to show that, if and when heavy raiding is resumed, thewhole of the Fire Service resources, in being or proposed, would be the absoluteminimum required to enable the centralized Fire Service to hold the situationand fulfil the purpose for which it was formed; and as the policy has been, andis, to prepare for such a contingency, I have felt bound to bring the present man-power issue before the War Cabinet for decision.13. It is also necessary to stress the point that the allocations suggestedare mainly to meet present and urgent requirements; that the intake from theNational Service Act has been very slow and must be greatly accelerated if thepresent serious deficiencies are not to remain for many months to come. It was clearly understood, when the Cabinet decided on the introduction of the NationalService Bill, that the machinery would be used for posting to the Fire Servicesuch additional personnel as might be required on defence considerations. In fact the machinery of the Act has been used only to such extent as men called up mayhave already been part-time members of the Auxiliary Fire Service or may haveexpressed a preference for entering the Fire Service; and as these numbers havefallen far short of requirements, the object of the measure has been frustratedand, as a result, the grave deficiencies which the Act was passed to remedy stillcontinue, in very large measure. It is, therefore, urged that the rate of postingunder the National Service Act should be immediately accelerated irrespectivelyof any expressed preferences, and that steps should be taken to supplement thecurrent intake from the National Service Act procedure by posting to the national fire Service any suitable men becoming surplus to London Region Civil defence requirements.Recruitment of Women (whole-time).14. As regards the recruitment of women for whole-time duty, the national fire Service requirements have been recalculated, in the light of more definite information which has become available as the reorganisation has progressed.The immediate requirements fall under main heads :-(a) Deficiencies in the staffing of the Fire Brigades which have been taken over, especially where the staffing of the local controls and facilitiesfor cooking and providing meals at stations and at fires was far belowthe minimum requirement for efficiency. Many of these women arerequired to make; it possible to employ the men on the 48/24 hourduty system.
(6) New requirements, consequent upon the reorganisation of the Service,especially for the main control rooms, administrative and clericalstaffs, which have to be superimposed on the purely &quot;local control organisation of the fire brigades, and for mobile control units,despatch riders, &amp;c.The current requirements under these heads, assuming that the women willbe employed on a 48 hours on and 24 hours off duty system (116 hours weekly asagainst 48 hours), and that full use is made of any part-time women who maybe available, are estimated as follows : Nucleus whole-time staff for control rooms at Fire Force,Divisional and Sub-Divisional Headquarters (over 3,000stations), and for mobile control units   ...       ...       ...      10,750Administrative and Clerical staffs (mainly at the 37 FireForce and 210 Divisional Headquarters) ,..       ...       ...        6,500Cooks and mess room staffs at stations; canteen van crews ...        7,160Stores (Fire Force Headquarters and Divisions)      ...       ...        1,800Car drivers, despatch riders and messengers ...       ...       ...        4,200Miscellaneous      .....................        2,70033,100Add for Scotland       .........      ...      ...        3,50036,600Less now-employed     ...      ...      ...       ...       ...      11,30025,300(B) Other Civil Defence Services.Whole-time Male Personnel.15. According to the latest figures available, the 220 scheme-makingauthorities have.in their employ 172,500 persons employed on a whole-time basis in their general Civil Defence Services, of whom it is estimated 53,000 are women.In some areas the Services are under strength and, indeed, have never beenfully recruited. In all areas the unreserved services have now lost most of theirmen of military age without being able to obtain replacements. Part-time volunteers of military age, unless reserved by reason of their primary occupation,have also been leaving in considerable numbers, and the registration of womenwill further,reduce the part-time establishments of the local authorities of theservices (e.g., Wardens and Report Centres) employing men or women, thusthrowing a greater strain upon the whole-time personnel, i.e., in the more vulnerable areas, until part-time losses are replaced.16. When the National Service Act, 1941, was in preparation it was contemplated that individual local authorities would be allowed to fill vacancies in their rescue and first-aid parties (as in the Auxiliary Fire Service and PoliceWar Reserves) by men called up under the Act. Vacancies in other services were to be filled by recruiting men over military age or women. In the light ofthe growing shortage of man-power, however, it became clear that local shortages in the Civil Defence Services must be met by more intensive mutual support arrangements and, if necessary, Regional Reserves, instead of by the filling of specific vacancies in local authority services. Accordingly, a token request for,000 men for Regional Reserves was included in the man-power requirement for the quarter ended the 30th September last. It soon became apparent, however,that the more urgent requirements of the Police and Fire Service would absorbmore men than would be available under the National Service Act in theimmediate future, and the formation of Regional Reserves was postponed in thehope that the 5,000 men estimated to be required for the purpose might become available later. In the light of the growing shortage of man-power, powers of transfer of individual whole-time-Civil Defence personnel from, the services oflocal authorities to the (Services of other local authorities,or to reserves under
Regional management are, therefore, now being taken by a Defence Regula-tion, and it is hoped, by redistribution of existing personnel (involving thethinning of the first line in the less vulnerable areas) to supply the greater partof the man-power required for Regional Reserves. Nevertheless, in some areasrecourse to new entrants cannot be avoided, and for that reason a reduced demandfor 2,000 men is now made. A proportion of these men may be required earlyin the New Year, but for the time being it is agreed that the postings to theNational Fire Service should take precedence.Women: Whole-time.17. Taking the country as a whole, there are no serious deficiencies in thewomen&apos;s whole-time establishments, though ambulance-driver vacancies cannotbe filled in many areas. Women employed whole-time in the general Services(like men) -are prevented by Defence Regulation 29b from leaving their employment without the consent of the responsible authority, and there is no serious wastage due to the loss of personnel to other Services. It should bepossible in most instances to fill such vacancies as occur in the general Servicesthrough normal wastage of casualties by compulsory enrolment on a part-time basis. On the other hand, as women without family responsibilities areincreasingly absorbed into the auxiliaiy Services or transferred to war industryin other districts, it will be increasingly difficult to find amongst those who arecompulsorily enrolled for part-time Civil Defence duties women who are able toleave their homes for long spells of duty at night. One specific and urgent demandfor women to be employed on a.whole-time basis is for ambulance drivers, mostlyin the London Region. They are required to replace 4.700 men due to be called up for militar^ service so soon as replacements can be found. For completereplacement, allowung for the present difference in working hours of male and female personnel, 7,000 women, mainly drivers, are needed. It is not at presentpossible to say whether the number of ambulances in service can be scaled downto correspond to the recent reductions in the Rescue Party, First Aid andWardens Services in the London Region. If this were practicable, the demandfor women could perhaps be reduced the pi&apos;oportionate reduction would be to5,100. I propose to discuss the question more fully with the Minister of Health.If the hours of employment of women personnel are increased, the requirements will be smaller, but an extension of hours would strengthen the case for increasedpay.(C) Police.Whole-time Male Personnel.18. As regards police, additional men are required to meet existingdeficiencies and wastage. Wastage is heavy, an important item being releasesto flying duties in the R.A.F., which accounted for 380 out of a total of about800 wastage in England and Wales in September. Allowing for part of therequirements to be met by economies in man-power (e.g.. by the replacement ofmen by women on certain duties) and local recruitment, the pool requirements upto June 1942 were put at 3,100 men for England and Wales and 500 for Scotland,in addition to the men already allocated. It has now been possible to reduce the pool requirements for both countries to 2,000, and if loss to the R.A.F. were arrested the figure might fall to 1,500, It is hoped to meet the difference between this reduced total and the original figure by further economies in man-poAver.particularly in the Metropolitan Police Force, where the Commissioner isprepared, in view of the man-power situation, to reduce his establishment andto make the men who are surplus available for transfer to the provinces. Most ofthe 2.000 men will not be needed at once, but to meet wastage as it occurs.Women: Whole-time.19. The estimated requirements of the Police Service are in theneighbourhood of 3.500 in England and Wales and 500 in Scotland. Thewomen are mainly required for work which is at present being done by maleconstables, and the estimate of men required assumes that at any rate aconsiderable proportion of these women will be available.
(D) Miscellaneous Ministry of Health Requirements.Women: Whole-time.20. There are now 20,000 unfilled vacancies for hospital nurses and 10.000unfilled vacancies for domestics in the hospitals and other institutions and inthe Health Services generally of England and Wales. If a high rate of sicknesswere to manifest itself the number would be substantially increased, possibly toa total of 40,000 to 45,000. The corresponding requirements for Scotland are put at 5,000 to January, 1942. No information is available as to the normalwastage under existing conditions, and some of the services are not directlyconnected with civil defence and less likely to attract new recruits than theWomen&apos;s Auxiliary or Civil Defence Services.(E) Summary of Whole-Time Requirements.21. Summarising the total revised requirements of male and femalepersonnel for the civil defence and ancillary services mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the global demands are as follows :  M. W.National Fire Service   ...      30,000* 25,300General Civil Defence ...        2,000 7,000-5,100Police     .........        2,000 4,000Health Departments    ...          ... 35,000 (excluding--1  --1  wastage)34,000 . 71,300(F) Part-time Requirements (all services).22. No estimate can be given of the numbers required. Recruits are needed(a) to bring revised establishments up to strength as stated in paragraph 8.for example, the number of part-time firemen is far below the number requiredto man the light pumps; (6) for the substitution in suitable occupations of womenfor men of military age; and also (c) in substitution of mobile women who transfer to the Auxiliary Women&apos;s Services or are moved elsewhere to industry. The first class of demand is urgent; on the progress of substitution depends the satisfaction of the other two.23. To obtain a sufficiency of fire guards (men only are subject to compulsionfor this duty) compulsory enrolment was found to be necessary, and plans arenow being considered for training fire guards to perform other Civil Defenceduties. In the same order of ideas it is essential that there should be compulsoryenrolment of women for other forms of part-time service in civil defence in orderto obtain the numbers required. Industry must not on this occasion be allowedto defeat the purpose of enrolment by claiming exemption for those women whowork whole-time on war production. These women, as a class, are likely to havethe most spare time at their disposal, and they must now make a part-timecontribution to Civil Defence a contribution which many have hitherto failed tomake by voluntary enrolment.24. Secondly, before industry absorbs the relatively large numbers not atpresent gainfully occupied who can be employed on a remunerated part-time basis, civil defence must have a prior claim for up to 4S hours per month, ofunpaid service; otherwise the main source of supply left in some areas for meetingthe Civil Defence part-time requirements will be the married woman who is notfree to go into industry and whose domestic obligations will keep her tied to thehouse at a time when the services of part-time civil defence workers are mostrequired, that is, during night raids.25. The Orders which I propose to make under Defence Regulation 26afor the compulsory enrolment of women for part-time service will take intoaccount all these considerations.* These are additional to the 14,300 men posted to the Fire Service under the NationalService Act.
(G) Conclusion.26. I have set out at some length my man-power requirements and thedifficulties hitherto experienced in meeting them. My duty is to let the WarCabinet know what provision is, in my considered view, necessary to maintainadequately the services for which I am responsible for protecting the populationagainst the scale of attack for which it has hitherto been assumed to be necessaryto prepare. I have no authority to make plans on other assumptions. Indeed,as the Prime Minister has repeatedly warned us, we must be prepared to meetthe intensive bombing in connection with invasion, not only night bombing of the type hitherto experienced. But whatever the War Cabinet may decide is a proper provision, I must press upon my colleagues the necessity of its being madeavailable without delay. As the days have shortened, the difficulties of traininghave increased. Men and women posted to the various services after intensiveraiding has been resumed Will be much less valuable than if they had had anopportunity of learning their work during a quieter period.27.   I now ask the Cabinet to decide: (1) What the whole-time man and woman-power allocation for civil defence purposes is to be: I should wish it to be an additional 31,000 menand 71,300 women, as set out in paragraph 20.(2) Whether irrespective of their preference for service with the armed forces, immediate steps should be taken to post to the National fire service the surplus civil defence personnel referred to in paragraph 12and special priority given to meeting the remaining requirements.(3) Whether approval may be given to the conclusions reached as to thepossible use of military and air force personnel and industrial fire brigades by way of reinforcement to the National Fire Service(paragraph 11).F . M.Home Office, November 21, 1941.
