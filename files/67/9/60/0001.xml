jT.P.(G) (41) 60. WAR CABINET. COPY NO._   ;gist June, 1941.       PURCHASE OF ENEMY SHIPS DMOBILISEDiff ^JTRALFORTS.Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport.1.        The question of enemy ships in neutral ports has been brought tothe attention of the War Cabinet in ,7.P. (G) (39) 125 and J.P.(G-) (41) 4,and to the attention of the Import Executive in I.E,(4l) 30.2.        H.M. Government have hitherto refused to acquiesce in any neutralbuying enemy ships immobilised in their ports, even though we might therebyhave secured some benefit through the use of the ships.3. ,      The Importance of denying foreign currency to the enemy has been held to be so great as to make it essential to stipulate in any case that thepurchase pribe should be blocked until after the war.   As there was no reasonfor the enemy to sell unless the advantage lay with him, it has hitherto been considered that any such stipulation would either prove ineffective or would in practice prevent the sale,4.        Any hope that unilateral action on the part of neutral Statessupported by1 our own belligerent rights would secure for us a share of theirenemy tonnage has been disappointed,,     Even those States which have detainedor taken possession of enemy ships are not planning to put them into servicewithout considering the interests of the owners.     They intend to recompensethe owners ipn. some way.     Argentina is in negotiation to buy the ships, -though the purchase money would be blocked until the end of the war, andothers may follow this example, either agreeing or fixing a purchase price.5. Keanwile the importance of ships to us has increased while the enemy&apos;sneed of foreign currency is less,6.        It is submitted therefore that proposals &quot;by neutrals to buy enemy ships which will result directly or indirectly in sufficient benefit to our shipping resources should in future be examined on their merits by theMinistry of War Transport, and that, if the Foreign Office, Admiralty and ministry of Economic Warfare agree, they should be accepted.     The purchase
price will be kept as low as possible and withdeld from the energyfor as long as possible, and we should insist on the maximum advantage from the employment of the tonnage which we could secure in negotiation.7.        A decision is urgently required owing to the action already taken in S. America.     Unless we accept purchase as a basis upon whichwe can agree to waive our belligerent rights and recognise transfer offlag, in exchange for some use o$ the ships ourselves, it will become necessary either to seize enemy ships transferred to a South Americanflag, with grave effect upon our relations with 3. America and theUnited States, or to allow such vessels to trade and thus to flout ourbelligerent rights.     Owing to our- uncertain position in law, we are anxious to avoid bringing before the Prize Court an enemy ship seizedon these grounds.8.        The Foreign Secretary, the First Lord of the Admiralty and theMinister of Eadnomic Warfare agree with this memorandum.Ministry of i7ar Aransport,21st June, 1%1.L
