WAR   CABINET.CONTROL OF BUILDING LABOUR.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.lo      At the Meeting of the War Cabinet held on the25th August (W.M.(41) 86th Conclusions, Minute 9) I was invited to adjudicate upon a dispute between the Ministerof Labour and National Service and the Secretary of Statefor Aira20      The dispute concerns some 450 men engaged onthe work, now nearing completion, of constructing a newaerodrome at pocklington.    The Secretary of State for Airdesires to retain 150 of the men on new work at Pocklington -the construction of a long run-way for heavy bombers - andto transfer the other 300 to work on two new aerodromes, atRiccall and Elvington, in the same neighbourhood.    TheMinister of Labour agrees to the retention of the 150 menat Pocklington, but wishes to transfer the other 300 to -workon the. new R.O.F.  filling factory at Thorp Arch.3.      I discussed this matter on the 26th August withthe Minister of Labour and National Service, the Secretaryof State for Air,  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Supply, and the Director-General, Works and Buildings,representing the Minister of Works and Buildings.4,      The issue quickly resolved itself into a questionof principle.    The Secretary of State for Air claimed thai;the men in questioned formed part of his quota of building labour under the scheme for the control of the buildingindustry, and that he was entitled to retain all such men,within the total allocated to his Department, and to employthem on Air Ministry work wherever he wished.5.      The Minister of Labour claimed that,  while hewas under obligation to do his utmost to ensure that each department had its agreed quota of building labour, he must,for this purpose, himself retain control of the movement ofthe personnel of the industry;    and that he was thus entitle!to move men from the work of one Department to that of anot.1 o:a department as he thought right in the national interests    Ifthis principle were admitted,  and the 300 men, who would shortly be surplus to requirements at Pocklington, were transferred to work at Thorp Arch he would give immediateinstructions to his local officers to confer with local officers of the Air Ministry with a view to obtaining men tcwork on the Riccall and Elvington aerodromes.secretary&apos;COPY NO. 6*8th August.  1941.-1-

6.      In many cases it  is, no doubt,  convenient *allow labour released by the completion of one contract to be transferred to another contract for the sameDepartment,  within the Department&apos;s allocation ofbuilding labour.    I am satisfied, however,  that theMinister of Labour must himself retain control of themovement of the personnel of the building industry, andthat he must be free to move men from the work of one department to that of another, as he thinks right inthe national interest, although this power will, of course,only be exercised with great discretion and after thefullest consideration.    Unless the Minister possesses &apos;    a power he cannot discharge his responsibilities to all departments under the scheme for the control of building labour and secure the most economical use of the labour force available.7,      It is also relevant to draw attention tothe fact that when the scheme for the control of thebuilding industry was under discussion at the Meetingof the Lord President!s Committee on the 6th May, 1941 .(L.P.(41) 17th Meeting), the Secretary of State for Warapprehended that there was a danger that certaincontractors would attach to themselves large blocks ofbuilding labour and would thus obtain a substantialhold on all Government building activities,  and solimit the Department1s choice of contractors.    TheSecretary of State for War was given a firm assurance that the Department&apos;s choice of contractors would notin fact be limited, since it could inform firms tenderingfor contracts, at the time of tender,  that if they were successful in obtaining the contract, the necessary labour would be made available to them, within theDepartmentTs allocation.8.      I accordingly ruled that the Minister ofLabour and National Service was free to transfer the300 men in question to the work at the Royal OrdnancePilling Factory at Thorp Arch,  it being understoodthat he would at once consider measures to provide thelabour required at Riccall and Elvington,9.      In the course of discussion a suggestion wasmade that the settlement of issues of the kind, underconsideration would be facilitated if local machinery-was established in the Region, representative of theinterests of Departments,  and responsible to theProduction Executive,    I invited the Ministry of Labourand National Service to pursue this suggestion,10.      Discussion also showed that there was considerable undertainty as to whether certain classesof labour were or were not included within the AirMinistry&apos;s allocation of building labour; e. gc,  certainclasses of electricians and labour imported from Eire.,It is desirable that these uncertainties should be cleared up as quickly as possible.    In rny opinion theonly satisfactory method is  that all classes of building labour, from whatever source they may be drawn, shouldbe included within the quota&apos; of building labourallocated to each Department,,1.
