Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1941.SECRET. Copy No. &apos;- o oW.P. (G) (41) 59.June 7, 1941.WAR CABINET.INDIA AND THE WAR.IN continuation of W.P. (G) (41) 53, the three following telegrams are circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.L. S. A.June 7, 1941.(1)Telegram from the Secretary of State for India, repeating one from the PrimeMinister to the Viceroy, dated May 31, 1941.3-U.Following personal and secret from Prime Minister, dated the 31st May,Your 1029--S of the 23rd May. If the expansion you think of making in yourExecutive Council is required for the war effort, it would certainly be justified onthat ground. But see your statement in paragraph 10 : &quot;It will not enhance our war effort.&quot; If, on the other hand, it is intended as an instalment of consti-tutional change, are you convinced that it will be worth while in view of yourstatement in paragraph 10 that &quot;This scheme will not give real satisfactionand will be violently criticised as falling short of even moderate demands andas not conceding transfer of Defence or Finance, &amp;c.&quot; ? Is there any danger ofthese proposals being repudiated at once by the Parties, both Congress and the moslem League ? Are you sure that Jinnah, Sikandar or Nazimuddin will notbe provoked and piqued, as apprehended by you in paragraph 6 ? Can you assureme that at this critical time in Iraq, Syria and throughout the Moslem world apositively bad effect may not be produced among them on the balance % Is there&apos;not a danger also that Gandhi will point to this minor step as a renewed cause ofoffence 1 Is the aged Hydari likely to prove an efficient counsellor, or has he beenchosen merely because he is the least likely appointment to antagonize Jinnahand the Moslem League %These changes, small though they be, will, of course, stir the embers of con-troversy both in India and the House of Commons. Have you satisfied yourselfthat they are worth the trouble they involve ? I shall be glad to have your answersupon these points before the matter is brought before the Cabinet, as I should propose, on Monday, the 9th June.[22598]
(3)Telegram from the Viceroy for the Prime Minister, dated June 3, 1941.1173-S.Personal and secret. Following for Prime Minister. Many thanks for yourpersonal and secret telegram 3-U. I have also had Amery&apos;s 4-U, which Iunderstand you have seen.2.   Position is briefly as follows : (a) Were I satisfied that we could wisely hold on without making any movewhatever I would have been very content to do so and would have advised in that sense. As it is, though I am not enthusiastic for going ahead (corrupt group) I sense in this country the growth of a moodof sullen resentment even among many persons of moderate views whohave in the past been consistently friendly towards the Government,and a feeling of frustration at complete stalemate which now facesus, through no fault of our own, which I think it wise to make someeffort to meet. My view is confirmed by reactions here, which I havebeen awaiting, to the debate in the Commons.   I have, in particular,Telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy, dated June 1, 1941.4-U.Private and Personal.The Prime Minister&apos;s searching questions are all very much to the point,but the essential thing is do you, or do you not, wish the Cabinet to accept your proposals? I certainly assumed you did in spite of various qualifying andminimising comments in your original telegram, and welcomed them on thatassumption. I regarded them not as in any sense a contribution to theconstitutional issue, but as a fulfilment of our declared intention of associatingIndians of good will with the war effort. This, however, in a form that did not raise that issue and clearly implied that we refuse to raise it. From that pointof view I believed that, while they would, of course, be denounced as derisoryby the party politicians, they would, in fact, appeal to moderate opinion, bothHindu and Moslem, that wishes to be helpful and feels its good willunreciprocated.As to the Executive, I never regarded the minor expansion now contemplated by you as a political concession, but as justified on merits. I should have saidthat, all political questions apart, the time had come for no longer doubling upLaw and Supply, Commerce and Man-power, Information and Home Affairs.Is that your view ?War Advisory Council. The Prime Minister has hardly touched on that,but to my mind it is the more important matter. It fulfils a pledge which was never dependent on a solution of the problem of getting the parties to come onto the Executive, though it was naturally postponed till we knew definitely howthat question was to be settled. It meets the reasonable demand of the Chamberof Princes and other loyal elements not to be kept wholly out of the picture.I should have thought it would not only give satisfaction to those elements,but make a definite, even if modest, contribution to the war effort in the localitiesand industries where its members may have influence.   Do you agree 1As to the Prime Minister&apos;s last paragraph, I cannot myself see your proposalsstirring up fresh trouble in India. They will be scorned, but they leave theparties where they are and they will give modest satisfaction to others.However, you must answer on that point. As regards the House of Commons,however, I cannot agree with the Prime Minister. The embers of controversythere and in the Press are very much alive and liable to flare up at any time.Your proposals will, at any rate, satisfy those critics who are prepared to supportthe Government on the main issue of last Augusts policy.
discussed individually and collectively with my Council and with a variety of prominent Indians. Almost without exception they favoursome sort of move, and that is the general feeling of the Governors.While I cannot judge the position at home, activities of Schuster,Moore, Stanley Reed, &amp;c, and remarks in paragraph 4 of Amery.&apos;telegram 4-U, all go to suggest that you may be under some pressureat that end too.(b) Like you, I am only too alive to the weak points in my plan.   It was forthat reason that I set them out in detail and, indeed, emphasised themin my recommendations to the Secretary of State, for I felt you and cabinet as well as he must be fully alive to them in taking yourdecision. But my conclusion, with the same full appreciation of thosepoints as your own, differs from yours. I would be prepared to go ahead within these very narrow limits much narrower in fact thanthose of August offer.(c) I am under no illusion, as my telegram will have shown you, as to theseproposals giving satisfaction here. I can give no guarantee that theywill not be attacked by all parties (I would, indeed, anticipate thatthey would be so attacked), but they represent a move. The fact thatIndians will be in a majority on my Council will steady moderate opinion. As for critics, I think that it is useful that they should have something new to chatter about. In short, I judge that my proposals will ease pressure for some months to come without compromisingpost-war settlement or rendering my Council at all difficult to manage.(d) I can give no guarantee as to wider Moslem reactions, such as you suggestin paragraph 2 of your telegram, but my telegram will have shownyou how fully I was alive to the importance of that issue in makingmy proposals. My hope is that, if I can get Moslems of sufficientstanding, but not sufficiently tied up in Moslem League politics, Ishall avoid trouble with Jinnah. (I would not anticipate serious trouble with Gandhi.) I cannot believe that he would welcome an expansion in which the Moslems were left out; nor would such an expansion be desirable politically. Akbar Hydari is 72, which, foran Indian, is old, as my telegram pointed out, but I think he will do.I might be able to find a stronger Moslem candidate from the States,but I doubt it, and I do not trust Mirza Ismail and am not keen ontaking him on. Hydari has standing and could, I think, work as amember of a team.  I would keep my own hand pretty heavy on him.3. I agree also with Amery that expansion of Council must be regarded asonly one of the series of connected proposals set out in my telegram of the23rd May. The War Advisory Council may be difficult to keep contented.But, as he points out, it brings in the Princes and gives moderate elements a chance to share in the war effort. I agree with him also that on merits thereis a good case for additional portfolios, for the burden is heavy at present, thoughit could continue to be carried out. If, then, any expansion is justifiedadministratively, let us try to turn it to some political advantage.4. I hope the above makes my position clear. If there is any point which you wish me to elaborate I will most readily do so. These proposals are definitelya pis alter. One can give no guarantee as to reaction to them except that theyare unlikely to turn the scale. But I hope that, if approved by the Cabinet, theywill keep people&apos;s minds engaged for a little longer, and, however much criticised,will have some value as a gesture. They are well within the August offer. HadI felt it wise to stand.firm and make no move at all, you may be certain that Ishould have said so.
