DRAFT LgAgLET&apos;&apos;...BEATING THE INVADER .Last Slimmer the Government issued the instruction that ifthis Island were invaded everyone should &quot;stay put&quot; unless he or -she received orders to the contrary.    This instruction stillholds good.    But in areas remote from the fighting conditionswill he different from those in.districts where fighting is actually going on, and the instruction will have a differentmeaning.    In the forward areas it means &quot;Stand Firm&quot;, and its object is to make .sure that there will be no fugitives blockingthe roads, and that everyone who has decided to stay in alikely area of attack, as for instance on the oast and .south........coasts, will &quot;Stand, firm&quot; in his dwelling or shelter till theenemy In the neighbourhood have been destroyed or driven out.   * &apos;In other areas, not near the scene of the battle, it means.&quot;Carry On&quot; - and, if invasion cOmcs; the duty of the civilianin most parts of the country will be to carry on with hisordinary work.&quot;This leaflet tells you what to do if invasion comes,CARRY ON.1. What do I do in areas, which are some way from thefighting?Stay, in your district and CARRY ON.    Go towork whether in shop, field, factory or office.Do your shopping, send your children&apos;to schooluntil you are told not to.    Do not try to goand live somewhore else.    Do not use the roadsfor   any unnecessary journey; they must be leftfree f. -.&apos; troop movements even a long way fromthe district whore actual fighting is takingplace. &apos;........--&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;.....2, Will certain roads and railways be reserved for the useof the military, even in areas-far from the scene of action?Yes, certain roads will have to be reserved forimportant troop movements; but such reservationsshould bo only temporary.    As far as possible,bus companies and railways will try&apos;to maintain essential public services, though it may benecessary to cut these down.    Bicyclists andpedestrians may use the roads for journeys towo?k, unless instructed not to do so.STAND FIRM3. What do I do if fighting &quot;breaks out in my neighbourhood?Keep indoors or in your shelter until the battleis over.    If you can have a trench ready inyour garden or field,  so much the better.    you may want to use it for protection if your house
is damaged...    But if you are at work, or if you have special orders, carry on as long as possible and only take cover when danger approaches.    Ifyou are on your way to work, finish your journeyif you can.If you see an enemy tank, or a few enemy soldiers,do not assume that the enemy arc in control ofthe area.

Issued by the Ministry of   /Hgr     Information on behalf ofthe War Office and the Ministry of Home SecuritySTAY where you AREIF this island is invaded by sea or air everyone who is not under orders must stay where he or she is. This is noti simply, advice : it is an order from the Government, and you must obey it just as soldiers obey their orders. Yourorder is &quot; Stay Put &quot;, but remember that this does notapply until invasion comes.Why must I stay put ?Because in France, Holland and Belgium, the Germans werehelped by the people who took flight before them. Greatcrowds of refugees blocked all roads. The soldiers who could have defended them could not get at the enemy. The enemyused the refugees as a human shield. These refugees were gotbut. on to the roads by rumour and false orders; Do not becaught out in this way. Do not take any notice of any storytelling what the enemy has done or where he is. Do not takeorders except from the Military, the Police, the Home Guard(L.D.V.) and the A.R.P. authorities or wardens.What will happen to me if I dont stay put?If you do not stay put you will stand a very good chance of beingkilled. The enemy may machine-gun you from the air in orderto increase panic, or you may run into enemy forces which havelanded behind you. An official German message was captured in Belgium which ran :&quot; Watch for civilian refugees on the roads.  Harass them as much as possible.&quot;Our soldiers will be hurrying to drive back the invader and willnot be able to stop and help you.  On the contrary, they will
have to turn you off the roads so that they can get at theenemy. You will not have, reached safety and you will havedone just what the enemy wanted you to do.How shall I prepare to stay put?Make ready yotir air-raid shelter; if you have no shelterprepare one. Advice can be obtained from your local Air RaidWarden or in &quot;Your Home as an Air-raid Shelter&quot;, theGovernment booklet which tells you how to prepare a shelterin your house that will be strong enough to protect you againststray shots and falling metal. If you can have a trench ready inyour garden or field, so much the better, especially if you livewhere there is likely to be danger from shell-fire.How can I help?You can help by setting a good example to others. Civilianswho try to join in the fight are more likely to get in the way-than to help. The defeat of an enemy attack is the task of the armed forces which include the Home Guard, so if you wish tofight enrol in the Home Guard. If there is no vacancy for you atthe moment register your name for enrolment and you will becalled upon as soon as the Army is ready to employ you. for those who cannot join there are many ways in which the Militaryand Home Guard may need your help in their preparations.Find out what you can do to help in any local defence work thatis going on, and be ready to turn your hand to anything if asked by the Military or Home Guard to do so.If you are responsible for the safety of a factory or some other important building, get in touch with the nearest military authority. You will then be told how your defence should fit in with the military organisation and plans.What shall I do if the Invader comes miway ?If fighting by organised forces is going on in your district and you have no special duties elsewhere, go to your shelter andstay there till the battle is past. Do not attempt to join&apos;inthe fight. Behave as if an air-raid were going on. The enemywill seldom turn aside to attack separate houses.But if small parties are going about threatening persons and property in an area not under enemy control and come yourway, you have the right of every man and woman to do what you can to protect yourself, your family and your home.Stay put.It&apos;s easy to say. When the time comes it may be hard to do.But you have got to do it; and in doing it you will be fightingBritain&apos;s battle as bravely as a soldier.iPrintsi in England)
issued by the Ministry of information in co-operation with the War OfficeMd the Ministry of Home Security,1       iBF     Ji .:../&apos;comesHOW TO DO IT&apos;TJ,HE Germans threaten to invade Great Britain. If theydo so they will be driven out by our Navy, our Armyand our Air Force. Yet the ordinary men and women ofthe civilian population will also have their part to play.Hitler&apos;s invasions of Poland, Holland and Belgium weregready helped by the fact that the civilian population wastaken by surprise. They did not know what to do when themoment came. You must not be taken by surprise. Thisleaflet tells you what general line you should take. more detailed instructions will be given you when the danger comesnearer. Meanwhile, read these instructions carefully and beprepared to carry them out.When Holland and Belgium were invaded, the civilian population fled from their homes. They crowded On theroads, in cars, in carts, on bicycles and on foot, and so helped the enemy by preventing their own armies from advancingagainst the invaders. You must not allow that to happenhere.   Your first rule, therefore, is(i) IF THE GERMANS COME, BY PARACHUTE,AEROPLANE OR SHIP, YOU MUST REMAINWHERE YOU ARE. THE ORDER IS &quot;STAYPUT&quot;.  -      &apos;: If the Commander in Chief decides that theplace where you live must be evacuated, he willtell  you  when  and  how to leave.   Until youreceive such orders you must remain where youare. If you run away, you will be exposed to far greater danger because you will be machine-gunned from the air as were civilians in holland and Belgium, and you will also block, the roadsby which our own armies will advance to turn the Germans out.IIThere is another method which the Germans adopt intheir invasion. They make use of the civilian population in order to create confusion and panic. They spread falserumours and issue false instructions. In order to prevent this, you should obey the second rule, which is as follows : (2) DO NOT BELIEVE RUMOURS AND DONOT SPREAD THEM. WHEN YOU receive an ORDER, MAKE QUITE SURE THAT ITIS A TRUE ORDER AND NOT A FAKEDORDER. MOST OF YOU KNOW YOURPOLICEMEN AND YOUR A.R.P. WARDENSBY SIGHT, YOU CAN TRUST THEM. IFYOU KEEP YOUR HEADS, YOU CAN ALSOTELL WHETHER A MILITARY officer is REALLY BRITISH OR ONLY PRETENDINGTO BE SO. IF IN DOUBT ASK THE POLICE-MAN OR THE A.R.P. WARDEN. USE YOURCOMMON SENSE.     &apos;
inThe Army, the Air Force, and the Local Defence Volunteerscannot be everywhere at once. The ordinary man and womanmust be on the watch. If you see anything suspicious, do notI rush round telling your neighbours all about it. Go at once: to the nearest policeman, police-station, or military officer andtell them exactly what you saw. Train yourself to notice the exact time and place where you saw anything suspicious, andtry to give exact information. Try to check your facts. the sort of report which a military or police officer wants from youis something like this : &quot; At 5.30 p.m. to-night I saw twenty cyclists come intoLittle Squashborough from the direction of GreatMudtown. They carried some sort of automatic rifleor gun. I did not see anything like artillery. Theywere in grey uniforms.&quot;Be calm, quick and exact. The third rule, therefore, is asfollows : (3) KEEP WATCH. IF YOU SEE ANYTHINGSUSPICIOUS, NOTE IT CAREFULLY and go AT ONCE TO THE NEAREST POLICE&quot;OFFICER OR STATION, OR TO the nearest MILITARY OFFICER. DO NOTRUSH ABOUT SPREADING VAGUERUMOURS. GO QUICKLY TO THE NEAR-EST AUTHORITY AND GIVE HIM THE FACTS.IVRemember that if parachutists come down near your home,they will not be feeling at all brave. They will not know where they are^ they will have no food, they will not know where their companions are. They will want you to give them food, means of transport and maps. They will wantyou to tell them where they have landed, where their comradesare, and where our own soldiers are. The fourth rule, there-fore, is as follows : (4) DO NOT GIVE ANY GERMAN ANYTHING.DO NOT TELL HIM ANYTHING. HIDEYOUR FOOD AND YOUR BICYCLES. HIDEYOUR MAPS. SEE THAT THE ENEMY GETSNO PETROL. IF YOU HAVE A CAR ORMOTOR BICYCLE, PUT IT OUT OF ACTIONWHEN NOT IN USE. IT IS NOT ENOUGHTO REMOVE THE IGNITION KEY; you must MAKE IT USELESS TO ANYONEEXCEPT YOURSELF.IF YOU ARE A GARAGE PROPRIETOR, you must WORK OUT A PLAN TO PROTECTYOUR STOCK OF PETROL AND YOURCUSTOMERS&apos; CARS. REMEMBER THATTRANSPORT AND PETROL WILL BE THEINVADER&apos;S MAIN DIFFICULTIES. make sure THAT NO INVADER WILL BE ABLE TOGET HOLD OF YOUR CARS, PETROL, MAPSOR BICYCLES.VYou may be asked by Army and. Air. Force officers, to helpin many ways. For instance, the time may come when youwill receive orders to block roads or streets in order to preventthe enemy from advancing. Never block a road unless youare told which one you must block. Then you can .help byfelling trees, wiring them together or blocking the roads withcars.  Here, therefore, is the fifth rule : (5) BE READY TO HELP THE MILITARY INANY WAY. BUT DO NOT BLOCK ROADSUNTIL ORDERED TO DO SO BY THEMILITARY OR L.D.V. AUTHORITIES.If you are in charge of a factory, store or other works,organise its defence at once. If you are a worker, make sure that you understand the system of defence that has been organised and know what part you have to play in it.Remember always that parachutists and fifth column men arepowerless against any organised resistance. They can onlysucceed if they can create disorganisation. Make certainthat no suspicious strangers enter your premises.You must know in advance who is to take command, whois to be second in command, and how orders are to. be transmitted. This chain of command must be built up and you will probably find that ex-officers or N.C.O.&apos;s, who havebeen in emergencies before, are the best people to undertakesuch command.  The sixth rule is therefore as follows: (6) IN FACTORIES AND SHOPS, ALL MANAGERSAND WORKMEN SHOULD ORGANISE some system NOW BY WHICH A SUDDENATTACK CAN BE RESISTED.vii the six rules which you have now read give you a general idea of what to do in the event of invasion. More detailedinstructions may, when the time comes, be given you by theMilitary and Police Authorities and by the Local defence volunteers; they will NOT be given over the wireless asthat might convey information to the enemy. These instruc-tions must be obeyed at once.Remember always that the best defence of Great britain is the courage of her men and women. Here is your seventhrule: (7) THINK BEFORE YOU ACT. BUT THINKALWAYS OF YOUR COUNTRY BEFORE you think OF YOURSELF.(52194)   Wt.       / 14,300,000   6/40   Hw.
