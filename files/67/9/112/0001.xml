SECRET.wTpTIgT (41) 112. copy NO,Tjth October. 1941.WAR CABINET.APPLICATION TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT OF THEREGULATIONS CONTROLLING TRAFFIC TO IRELAND.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.A question of principle has arisen affecting the position ofMembers of Parliament which I think it desirable to bring beforethe War Cabinet.In view of the necessity of limiting the volume of traffic to Ireland Regulations have been made restricting the grant ofpermits to cases where the applicant is travelling on business ofnational importance or is travelling to his home.On the 11th September Mr. McGovern, M.P., asked for a permit to enable him to spend a month in Ireland travelling in both   -Northern and Southern Ireland.    He said, &quot;The purpose of my visitis that as National Chairman of the Independent Labour party Ihave been asked to have an exchange of opinions with a number&apos;of representative persons as to their view of the manner in whichNazism and Fascism should be opposed and destroyed&quot;.    In the reply from the Home Office Mr. McGovern&apos;s attention was called to the printed Regulations - copy attached - and he was informed that theHome Secretary could not regard visits by Members of Parliament on matters affecting their political parties as establishing a claim for a permit on the ground that the journey is of national importance at the present time.The following day Mr. McGovern telephoned to Mr. PeakefsPrivate Secretary saying that he had been to see Mr. Cahir Healyin Brixton Prison (permission for this visit had been granted tohim by the Home Office) and that he wanted an exit permit to goto Eire end Northern Ireland in the hope that he might collectmaterial which would clear Mr. Healy from suspicion-and lead tohis release.    There was no indication that Mr. McGovern had been commisioned by Mr. Cahir Healy to take up his case, and when thematter was submitted to me I agreed with the departmental view thatthe second application could not be brought within the terms ofthe Regulations controlling the grant of exit permits.The matter was raised by a Parliamentary Question asked byMr. Maxton on the 14th October, and in supplementary questions theview was expressed by several Members (Sir Herbert Williams5Mr.    Maxton, Sir Irving Albery, Mr. Hore-Belisha and Mr. NeilMaclean) that a Member of Parliament ought to be free to travel toany part of the country for the purpose of enabling him to exercise his rights and duties as a Member of the House of Commons.The practice in administering the Regulations has been toapply to Members of Parliament the same principles as are apoliedto other persons. When Mr. Hore-Belisha in August last asked for permission to visit Ireland, the Home Office, before granting thepermit, ascertained that both the Minister of Information and theSecretary of State for the Dominions regarded it as in the national
interest that permission should be granted.    Mr. Stokes,M.P.,was also given a permit to visit Ireland on business which wascertified by the Ministry of Supply to be of national importance.On the other hand exit permits have been refused to Members ofParliament who merely wanted to go to Ireland for private affairSir Assheton Pownall, for example, raised the question whether hecould go to stay with a relative in Northern Ireland, and SirErnest Bennett asked whether he could go on some businessconnected with fishing rights, and both these..applications were refused.Similarly the restrictions on entry into defence areas have been applied to Members of Parliament as-to other persons.Members of Parliament who wish to go for the purpose of holidayor recreation to some defence area have been told that there isa general prohibition on- entry into these areas for such purposes and, that no special privilege can be granted to individuals.The necessity of limiting the volume of traffic to ireland has made it necessary to refuse permission in many cases wherethere are legitimate- and reasonable grounds for a journey.Hardship has necessarily been caused to   individuals who wish to visit relatives, and to school teachers and others who wish to spend their holidays in Northern Ireland.    Business visits havealso been hindered unless the appropriate department certifiedthat the business was of national importance.The question has from time to time been considered whetheradequate control might be exercised on a selective basis, freedombeing given to the responsible-officials to decide whether a sufficiently good case is made out or not.    It has, however, beendecided that such a policy could not be operated in a defensiblemanner.    The difficulty when dealing with hundreds of applicationof deciding that one applicant has a reasonably good case andanother has not is great. , There is almost infinite variety inthe nature of the reasons given and the degree of their cogency.The Department would be open to justifiable charges of partialityand of yielding to pressure from persons of standing unless thecontrol were exercised in accordance with the general principlesapplicable to all applicants alike.    It.is because I have been anxious to avoid making the departmental officials the judge ofwhat is or what is not a sufficiently good case, that thedecision was taken to administer the control in accordance withdefinite Regulations which have been printed and of which copiesare supplied to all applicants.The question therefore at issue is whether the Regulationsshall be applied as at present to&apos; all applicants or whether aspecial exemption shall be made for Members of Parliament.    IIsuch an exemption were made,  I think it would have to be absoluteThere would clearly be objections to placing on the Home office the responsibility of deciding.&apos; that a&quot; permit might be granted toone Member and not to another,.There are obvious objections to giving to all Members ofParliament a privileged position which is not granted to ordirp&apos;^members of the public:    and in practice it might be difficult tomaintain a distinction between. Members of Parliament as such andother persons holding public positions of dignity and standing-.Moreover if an exemption were made for Members of Parliament inrespect of travel to Ireland, similar claims might be made for- exemptions from numerous other controls established under theDefence Regulations.    For example, is such an exemption to be
extended to   all exit permits including permits to travel abroad to America, the Dominions, the Colonies and neutral countries?Clearly the provisions controlling entry into special places,such as protected factories or the special area in the North ofScotland, could not properly be weakened by an absolute exemption for all Members of Parliament.As regards Mr. McGovern&apos;s claim to go to Northern ireland for the purpose of investigating the case of Mr.  Cahir Healy, itwill no doubt be represented that the Home Secretary in theexercise of his responsibility with regard to exit permits ought not to be empowered to prevent a. Member of Parliament frominvestigating the question whether the Home Secretary hasexercised properly his functions under Regulation 18B;    and hadMr. McGovern been expressly authorised by Mr. Cahir Healy to make enquiries on his behalf I might have taken a different view ofthe application.    On the other hand, the statutory method bywhich a person who is detained under Regulation l8B can get his case considered is by means of an application to the xldvisoryCommittee,  (Mr. Cahir Healy, in fact, has refused to go beforethe Advisory Committee), and this method having been accepted, byParliament for the investigation of cases under Regulation 18B,I should find it difficult to hold that the desire of a Memberof Parliament to enquire into one of these cases is a sufficientground for granting him a special privilege which is notauthorised by the general Regulations governing the grant of exitpermits.It must be remembered that once a traveller has reachedNorthern Ireland there is nothing to prevent him going into Eire;and if the principle were accepted that a Member of Parliamentmust be given permission to travel to any part of the UnitedKingdom, there will be no control over visits by Members ofParliament to Eire.If an exemption were granted to Members of the House ofCommons it would also have to be granted to Members of theHouse of Lords,  and on the whole my view is that the objectionsto granting to Members of both Houses special exemption from theRegulations controlling traffic to Ireland outweigh theadvantages of any concession, but there may be some body ofopinion in the House supporting the claim that a Member ofParliament should be free to travel at any rate to any part ofthe United Kingdom, and I am anxious to take into considerationany views which the War Cabinet may have on this subject.H.M.HOME OFFICE.15th October, 1941.
