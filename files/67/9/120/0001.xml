(G) (41) 120.October 27, 1941.&apos; &apos; -&apos;       &apos; - : -.       -V;:;-.      ./AWAR CABINET.SHELL MEX HOUSE.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.FOR three months past the Ministry of Supply has asked for possession ofShell Mex House for the Headquarters staff.At present the heads of some of the principal departments are scattered overLondon. There is no room to accommodate them with their appropriatesubsidiary staff-in Shell Mex House.They are wanted day and night for consultation either, personally or by telephone.The time spent in telephoning to them is increased by the inevitable pressure on the exchange, which often makes it impossible for contractors to make, con tactby telephone with the Ministry.Meanwhile many individuals with no security credentials and with noMinisterial control either occupy accommodation or exchange lines on the telephone.As winter draws on, officers of the Ministry must be enabled to work underblackout conditions, and, so far as possible, safely. Only in Shell Mex Housecan the Ministry of Supply have anything approaching adequate accommodation.I ask that the Ministry of Supply should have one Headquarters office under its control.B.October 27, 1941.[23067]
