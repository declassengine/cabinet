Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.Tuesday, November 11, 1941.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :MY Peoples have entered upon the third year of war with heightened vigourand resolution. I have seen the courage and fortitude with which they haveendured savage attacks from the air, and I have watched with admiration theselfless devotion of the Civil Defence Forces.During the past year My Forces, by sea, land and air, have continued, withthe powerful support of the Armed Forces of My Allies, to defend the cause of freedom throughout the world. The enemy has added to the number of countriestemporarily over-run, but the epic resistance of Greece and Yugoslavia, worthy of their glorious history, has inspired the civilised world.I heartily welcome as an Ally the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.On the 12th-July My Government agreed with the Government of the soviet union to aid each other in the war against Germany and to conclude no separatearmistice or treaty of peace. The heroic resistance of the armies of the soviet union has won My deepest admiration. A Conference on aid to Russia between representatives of My Government and of the Governments of the United Statesof America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has been held in Moscowwith eminently satisfactory results, and, in co-operation with the United Statesof America, My Empire is affording the Soviet Union all possible assistance against the common foe.The life-time of this Parliament has been memorable for the strengthening of the already close ties between My Governments and Peoples and the Govern-ment and People of the United States of America. A striking illustration ofthis growing intimacy was afforded by the meeting at sea between the Presidentof the United States and the Prime Minister of my Government in the UnitedKingdom. On the waves of the ocean, commanded by our two Navies in closestfraternity, a Charter was agreed upon and published to the world, which will stand as a beacon in history radiating resolution, justice and unselfish purpose.My Navy has continued to attack the enemy wherever it has been able toestablish contact with him. Together with the Fishing Fleet and otherAuxiliaries it has maintained unceasing vigil and has kept open the seaways onwhich My gallant Merchant Navy, and the Merchant Fleets of My Allies, have brought an increasing flow of food-stuffs and munitions.The position of My Forces in the Middle East has been greatly strengthened.The brilliant campaigns in East Africa, where the enemy, despite greatnumerical superiority, were evicted from the mountain fastnesses of Eritrea and ethiopia, reflect the highest credit on the skill of My Commanders and theendurance of My Forces from many parts of the Empire. These operations,which augur well for the future, were only rendered possible by the annihilationlast winter of the enemy forces which threatened Egypt from Cyrenaica.
Developments in the Far East have engaged the close and constant attentionof My Government, and it has been necessary to increase the Forces which defendMy territories in that area.It has been a source of great gratification to Me that My Prime ministers of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, and New Zealand have found it possible to visit this country and confer with My Ministers in the UnitedKingdom. Valuable discussions have been held in Egypt with My Prime Ministerof the Union of South Africa. The Premier of Burma has also visited thiscountry and discussed with the appropriate Ministers matters of common interest,These personal exchanges are of the utmost value to My Ministers in the prosecution of the war.Members of the House of Commons :I thank you for the increased provision you have made towards the cost ofthe war. The unprecedented measures you have taken have been whole-heartedlysupported by My People, who have willingly borne the heavy additional taxationimposed upon them and have also freely responded to the call for loans.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The compensation provided by the War Damage Act for damage to propertythrough enemy action has further strengthened the war economy of the country.Under Providence, and thanks to the unexampled efforts of the seafaringand farming communities, the food supplies of My People are assured.And I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may attend you.
Draft of The king Speech on the Opening of Parliament.Wednesday, November 12, 1941.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :THE developments of the past year have strengthened the resolution of my peoples and of My Allies to prosecute this war against aggression until finalvictory. Meanwhile, My Government, in consultation with the Allied Govern-ments, and with the goodwill of the Government of the United States of America,are considering the urgent problems which will face them when the nations nowenduring the tyranny of the oppressor have regained their freedom.I well know that My People will continue to respond wholeheartedly to thegreat demands made upon them to furnish My Forces with the instruments of victory, and that they are determined to meet, to the utmost of their power, the fresh and insistent calls arising from the heroic efforts of My Soviet Ally.The United States have undertaken to furnish My Peoples and My Allieswith war supplies of all kinds on a scale unexampled in history.My relations with Turkey, with whom I have a valued treaty of alliance,remain on a basis of friendship and sympathetic understanding.I rejoice at the restoration to His throne of His Majesty the Emperor of ethiopia and I look forward to an early resumption of diplomatic relations.Thus the first country to have fallen a victim to the aggression of the enemyPowers will have been the first to regain freedom and independence.My loyal subjects in Malta continue to face air attack with unbroken courageand resolution.Members of the House of Commons :You will be asked to make further financial provision for the conduct ofthe war.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The fulfilment of the task to which we are committed will entail theunsparing response of every one of us. I am confident that My People are firmlyresolved to answer every call made upon them with the spirit, courage and devotionwhich our forefathers have always shown in previous great crises of our history.My Government will continue to take all practical steps to sustain the health and well-being of My People under the stress of war.And I pray that Almighty God may give His blessing to your counsels.
