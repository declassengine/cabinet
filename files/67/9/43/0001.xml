WAR CABINET.SECURITY.Note by the Prime Minister addressed to Ministers in charge of departments.AN intense effort should be made to achieve greater security in matters where secrecy is of fundamental importance to the conduct of the war.No detailed set of rules can be devised applicable to all Departments. Themethods set out in the annexed Memorandum, which has been prepared under mydirections, are based on the experience of Departments generally. They are intended to provide a guide by means of which the systems now in force will be tested; and they should not be departed from without good reason.The Permanent Head of each Department is responsible to his Minister for reviewing from time to time the arrangements in his Department, taking thisMemorandum as a guide. , It is only by constant effort that, on the one hand,security can be ensured, and, on the other hand, the multiplicity of needlessrestrictions, which clog the progress of business, can be avoided.I ask each Minister to see that the arrangements in his Department arereviewed on the lines indicated, and I propose to arrange for a report to besubmitted to me at a later date showing what action has been taken to give effectto this Note. :w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,May 27, 1941. -     &apos; -     -----[22446]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.

MEMORANDUM.Definition ok &quot;Highly Secret&quot; Papers.1. Reasons can be found for labelling as &quot; Secret&apos;: a very large proportionof the documents produced in Government Departments or circulating within theFighting Services. But the attempt to apply rigid precautions to a very large volume of documents not only slows down the machine, but inevitably makes itimpossible to apply the precautions effectively, and leads to their neglect.2. The first essential in any sound security system is therefore to ensure a proper understanding of the limited class of documents to which really stringentprecautions should be applied, and to cut out unnecessary precautions in regardto other documents.3. There is at present no uniform practice in departments for designatingthe various degrees of secrecy applicable to different classes of documents. Thestringent precautions described in this Memorandum are intended to apply tothat strictly limited class to which the highest degree of secrecy is assigned.These are referred to below as &apos;&apos; highly secret &apos;&apos; papers, though this may notnecessarily be their actual marking.4. The papers to be included in this class are not easy to specify, but theyshould be confined as far as possible to the following : (i) Plans of future operations.(ii) Papers giving particulars of the disposition or impending movements of our forces, or of convoys, escorts and ships.(iii) Particulars of the present and future strength of our forces, and ratesof production of major munitions of war.(iv) A small, but very important, class of political papers dealing with suchmatters as negotiations for alliances, and the like,(v) Information, the disclosure of which would make known the methodsrelied on by our Intelligence Service, or would imperil our secretagents, and information about counter-espionage matters,(vi) Information about new secret methods of warfare, including scientific and technical developments in connection therewith.5. It must, of course, be understood that there are many documents whichalthough they may contain some information bearing on the above matters, do noton that account qualify to belong to the &quot; highly secret &quot; class. For example, theposting of an Officer to a particular regiment in a particular locality may disclose the location of that unit. But a document containing information of this kind is not in the same category of secrecy as a Paper which sets out the whole of ourOrder of Battle.
MiPrecautions to be observed in respect of &quot; Highly Secret &quot; Papers.6. One of the most obvious precautions, and one most often neglected, is tocontrol the habit of compiling and putting into circulation comprehensivedocuments giving details on these very secret matters. Individual officers orsections need usually only be given particulars of that part of the business whichaffects them.7. No detailed code of rules can be devised which will be applicable to all departments.   The system in force must ensure : (i) That every Paper dealing with highly Secret matters should be seen byas few people as possible,(ii) That those who handle it at any stage in its production, distribution and subsequent use, can be identified and are known to be trustworthy.8. The notes in the following paragraphs are intended to give effect to thesetwo cardinal points, and are based on the general experience of Departments.Production of &quot; Highly Secret &quot; Papers.9. This must not be carried out in general typing sections, but in a specialsection of people of known reliability. The &quot;Copy-number&quot; system must beemployed for such Papers, and must be extended to cover all preliminary draftscirculated for approval10. The copy-number system cannot in itself prevent the purloining of loosesheets during the production of a document. The only safeguards against this are, first, the employment of persons of known reliability and, secondly, effectivesupervision throughout the time when such documents are being produced.11. All rough drafts, dictation books and waste-paper containing any partof the document must be disposed of as secret waste (see paragraph 26).Distribution.12. The number of copies of &apos;&apos; Highly Secret&apos;&apos; Documents distributedshould be as few as possible and the destination of each must be recorded. Eachcopy for distribution should be enclosed in a sealed envelope addressed to the recipient, and bearing instructions that it is to be opened only by the recipient.The envelope containing the document should be forwarded in a locked box. the contents of any such box and the time of its despatch must be recorded and thebox should be signed for by the messenger who takes it to its destination in another department.Reception.13. There must be a proper system in all Departments for the centralreception of boxes containing &quot;Highly Secret&quot; documents from other Depart-ments.  The receipt given by this central organisation to the messenger who brings[22446] b 2
4the box ends the responsibility of the issuing Department for that box. The rapidconveyance of the box to the person for whom it is intended is then the responsi-bility of the receiving Department.Distribution and handling within the originating or receiving Department.14. All &quot;Highly Secret&quot; documents are addressed to individuals. Someresponsible person, deputed for the purpose, must be charged with ensuring thatthe document is not passed to any person who is not bound to see it in the courseof his duty. Such documents are never tp be copied by the recipients, but shortextracts may be made and sent to officers required to take action thereon. if further complete copies are required, these should be obtained from the Depart-ment issuing the document, where the additional distribution can be recorded.When a &quot;Highly Secret&quot; document is passed for action to individuals otherthan the recipient, a check must be kept to ensure that the document is returnedto the original holder.Files containing &quot; Highly Secret &quot; Papers.15. Any files on which &quot; Highly Secret &quot; Papers are put must be speciallymarked and subject to special precautions. They should only be circulated inlocked boxes, unless they are carried by responsible officials. The typing of minutes on these files must be carried out under special precautions, and theircustody entrusted to special sections.&quot;Highly Secret&quot; Telegrams.16. Telegrams dealing with &quot;Highly Secret &quot; matters cannot be dealt within the same way as &quot; Highly Secret&quot; documents generally. In the first place,speed is essential in the case of telegrams dealing with, e.g., operational matters,and it is often important that many Officers should i&apos;eceive copies at once. Again,these telegrams are often of passing importance only, and it is not as a rulenecessary to record the destination of each copy or to take receipts. -Nevertheless,the system in force should be sufficiently elastic to ensure that special precautionscan be applied to the very small number of telegrams dealing with matters onAvhich secrecy is absolutely vital, which are received from time to time. Forexample :  (i) Only persons of known reliability should be employed on cyphering, andon reproducing telegrams, and the staffing arrangements should permit of a real measure of supervision over the staff engaged in this work.(ii) Continual effort must be made to keep the distribution down to theminimum. This can only be done by constant personal investigation by an officer charged with the task by the Head of the Department.(iii) Highly Secret Telegrams should be circulated only in locked boxes, orby the hand of responsible officials,-(iv) Care must be taken to destroy superfluous drafts and copies.
Precautions for dealing with papers of a lesser degree of secrecy.17. It is not the purpose of these notes to prescribe what precautions shouldbe applied to documents of a secret character other than those falling in the highly Secret category as defined at the beginning of this note. It must be left to departments to settle which of the above precautions should be adopted, either as they stand, or with modifications. All possible steps should be taken to exclude entirely from any secret category papers which are not really secret, sincetoo great an insistence on secrecy not only hampers the work, but brings thewhole system into discredit.General security precautions.18. The following notes touch Gn security precautions in a number of matters of general office routine.Rooms where Secret Papers are handled.19. &quot; Highly Secret&quot; documents should never be left in trays or on desksexcept when they are being worked on. Where available, boxes with snap locksshould be kept in each room in which documents can be placed when they are notlocked up in a safe. Boxes containing &quot; Highly Secret &quot; documents should not beleft about in rooms at night, but should be placed in safes or steel presses.20. Wall-maps, diagrams and charts on which dispositions, &amp;c, are marked,should be covered, so that they cannot be seen by visitors or others entering theroom.Selection of Staff.21. Care should be taken to employ a staff of known reliability in the specialsections for the production of &quot;Highly Secret&quot; documents and for other keyemployments, such as cyphering staffs. A negative check, i.e., that nothing isknown against a man or woman, is of very little value. What is required ispersonal recommendation from some person whose judgment can be relied on.Code words.22. The code word for an operation should not be mentioned in the samedocument as any reference which might give a clue to the nature of the operation.Where this cannot be avoided the document must be included in the &quot; HighlySecret&apos;&apos; class.Gossip.23. General warnings have from time to time been issued on the dangers ofgossip on confidential matters, and the discussion of such matters in public places.It is the duty of all who have knowledge of operations projected, or being carriedout, to refrain from imparting their knowledge to anyone who is not bound in thecourse of his duty to be made aware of it.
Telephones.24. Staffs should constantly be reminded that, unless a &quot;privacy equip-ment&apos;&apos; has been installed, no conversation on the telephone, even on the &apos;&apos; directline&quot; or &quot; federal &quot; systems, can be regarded as secure. If it is necessary todeal with secret matters on the telephone, this should be done by allusions whichwould be understood by the two people carrying on the conversation, but not byanyone else.Access to Offices.25. A system should be in force in all Government Departments directlvconcerned with the conduct of the war to ensure that no person can enter unless(i) he possesses a Pass issued by a Department; or (ii) a temporary Pass is issued to him. Visitors, even when provided with temporary Passes, must be conductedto the officer whom they wish to see, by a messenger, and should not be allowed towander about unescorted.Secret Waste.26. Secret waste, which includes spoilt copies of Secret documents of allkinds, recalled drafts and other superfluous Secret Papers, must be collected andburnt, under supervision. The only exception to this is where a shreddingmachine has been installed in the Department concerned and operated undersupervision. A constant check must be kept to see that Secret waste does not go into the ordinary waste-paper basket to which unauthorised persons have access.Locks, safes and keys.27. Departments are enjoined to review the security of the safes or lockedpresses in which highly Secret Papers are kept.&quot;28. Boxes for the circulation of Secret Papers should not be left lying aboutunlocked, even if empty.29. Officers should be encouraged not to take their keys out of the office, butto leave them in an office key box opened by a combination lock.
