69.COPY NO.  jWAR CABINET.Contraband Delays.Note by the Minister of Shipping.On 20th October the War Cabinet invited me to confer with the Minister of Economic Warfare as to what measures could be taken to expedite the examination of vessels atContraband Bases,    and to report the action taken /Minute-       c),W. M.( 39 )5h7-I have since been in close touch with the Minister ofEconomic Warfare on this subject;    the paper (W.P,(G)(39)68)circulated by him was prepared in consultation with my Department^,and I am in general agreement with the recommendations madetherein for the elimination of unnecessary delays.The chief interest of the Ministry of Shipping in thismatter is to avoid delays to friendly neutrals who are at present under a strong sense of grievance,,      This is particularly important at the present time when I am negotiating with themfor the supply of tonnage0      These neutrals are using the argument that they cannot put at the disposal of this country so muchtonnage as they might otherwise be able to offer because the delays to their ships are reducing the importing capacityavailable to their own countries,      Some individual neutralshipowners with whom I am at present negotiating have sufferedsubstantial losses through delays, and this does not help thenegotiations from our point of view,.stry of Shipping,3rd November, 1939-
