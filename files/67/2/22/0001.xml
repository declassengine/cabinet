This Document is the Property of His Britannic majesty government.SECRETV7.P.G. (39) 71lbW A RB I ITInLIA ANi? 1H&quot;.i WAR:.Mefliofand-iiJD. hy the Ceorstsroy of State&apos; for India.(preyious paper;I circulated on Friday night without comment to theV/ar Cabinet in viev; of what appeared to be tho urgency ofthe matter a telegram   from the Viceroy in which he proposed,in the hope of averting a final breach with the Congress, to revert to negotiations with the object of bringing aboutthe Federation provided for by the Act.    This morning,however, I received from him two further telegrams whichI circulate herewith, one of them containing the text ofthe letter the Viceroy has received from the presidentof the All-India Congress party with whom, together withMr.Gandhi and Mr.Jinneh, the president of the All-IndiaMoslem League, he had been in further discussion during thecourse of the past week.    These discussions were inpursuance of the plan the Var Cabinet approved on 25thOctoher.It seems to me clear that this letter removes whateverslight chance there may have been of any of the parties concerned, and certainly the Congress, being willing nowto reconsider their rejection of tho federal provisions ofthe Act;    and, on receipt of it, I telegraphed to theViceroy asking whether ho agreed with this assumption.I have circulated these telegrams as it is clearly desirable that the Var Cabinet should fully appreciate the

position as it now stands.    It now seems beyond doubt clearthat the Congress will refuse, and continue to refuse,their co-operation in the conduct of the war so far as india is affected unless they receive a formal declaration and agreement to consequential arrangements to the following effect:(l) that India is a free and independent country,&quot;independence&apos;1 no doubt not being regarded by the greatmajority of the persons responsible for the claim asinconsistent with the full status of a self-governingmember of the British Empire:(2) that the Indian people have the right of self-determination and. accordingly will be free to frametheir own Constitution through a Constituent assembly which is to be set up and conduct its business withoutexternal interference;(3)  that this Constituent Assembly shall be elected by persons voting on a franchise on the widest possible basis, - the communal representation for which provision is to be made being based on agreement by the communities concerned;(h)  that full protection shall be given through theConstitution to the rights and interests of &quot;real&quot;minorities,  the nature of this protection being determined by agreement between the parties concerned^and(5)  that the British Government undertake to enable themachinery for these purposes to be put in motionimmediately after the war, and meanwhile to take some effective steps to associate Indians responsiblywith the conduct of the war.Before this letter was written the Congress Governmentin five of the eight provinces in which that party commands

a majority had already tendered their resignation, and ineach of these, finding no possibility of an alternativeGovernment, the Governor has accepted, or y/ill very shortly accept, the resignatj on and bos issued, or will shortly issue, a procZa-aatiovi under section 93 of theGovernment of Indja Ac L, i9^bj assuming to himself all thepowers of government,,    Chore seems a faint possibility of analternative government in Assam, but unless thismaterialises :in. the course of the next 1&apos;e;r days theposition will be the same in thai; province and in the tworemaining Congress Provinces.\ie are therefore faced with the alternative: ofcomplying substantially with the demands of the Congressas summarised, above,or of taking all necessary steps to frustrate or overcome the active opposition which seemsalmost certain before very long to develop, very possibly on a widcspread sca1e.In order that the Cabinet may be fully informed, Icirculate herewith in chronological order my telegram of26th October to the Viceroy conveying to him theauthority of the Gabj.net to proceed on the lines discussed at their meeting on 25th Goto   (see War Cabinefc&apos;conclusions60(39) I/iin.  l)   and all the more important telegrams whichI have received from the Viceroy giving his account andhis impressions of developments since that date-.hth November, 1939.

u?Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy dated26th October 1959.---------312Private and personal.        The Cabinet gave furtherconsideration to the Indian problem yesterday in light ofyour telegrams 2357-S and 236S-S of the 32nd October.and2385-S of 24th October.      They now authorise you to invitethe leaders of Congress and of the Muslim League to meet you and to discuss the situation with them on the lines proposedby you in your telegram 2335-S of the 24th.      liter prolongeddiscussion the Cabinet agreed that you should be authorisedto proceed on the plan indicated in paragraph 5 of yourtelegram 2385-S,  Cabinet agreement covering,  if that stageis reached, the entertainment of proposals for includingIndian Political leaders in the Central Government on the lines proposed by Zafrull ah. Khan, but subject to these restrictions:that the Commander-in-chief should remain a member of theExecutive Council and that it  should always be fully understood that this arrangement will not diminish or remove the powers conferred  on yen by Section 42  (2) binth Scheduleor on me by Section 314 of Act  of 1955.    It  should be furtherunderstood that there would be no impairment  of british control over security and armed forces and the right to movethose forces either inside or outside India.    The Cabinetdesired a distinction to be drawn between this ad hocarrangement for the period of the war and the wider questionof constitutional reform at the end of the war.    They wishedsie to make it clear to you,  so that you could make use of thisi nf o rm a t i on i n your disc u s s ions w i t h I n d i an 1 e a d e r s i. f y o uthought it expedient, that Government could contemplate no

olegislation here modifying the Act of 1935 during theprogress of the war.      So far as ccrami allotments for thefuture are concerned they are not prepared  to go beyondthe wording used in this connection in your statement.For your personal information I would add that therewas strong opposition to your suggestion that theportfolio of Defence might be held by an Indian.    This,however, cannot now arise in view of the fact that theCabinet require the Commander-in-Chief to be retained asa member of the Executive Council.    It was strongly urgedin the Cabinet that the dropping of the C cmmander-in-Chieffrom the Executive Council at the beginning of a war wouldbe seriously misunderstood, particularly in the ranks ofthe Conservative party here.    It was also urged that you should beware of giving other minorities and communitiesgrounds for supposing that you were endeavouring tc coneto an agreement with Congress and the All-India muslim league behind their backs and with a view to avoidingthis possibility it was hoped that if the discussions,which you contemplate with the leaders  of the Congress and the muslim League look like developing hopefully you might find it possible to call in other prominent leaders and in thisconnection the name of Dr-Ambedkar was particularlymentioned.    It  occurs to me that if eventually you are ableto reach an agreement on the lines of Zafrullah&apos;s schemeyou might invite Dr.Ambedkar to join the Executive council as one of the members appointed in 3rour discretion.    I donot yet know exactly what Sain Ho are is going to say this afternoon hut he is going to make a conciliatory speech andend up by saying that so far as we are concerned the door

to further consultation with the Indian leaders is notclosed.    I have supplied him with all the telegrams which you have sent me containing points which you think might do usefully developed and I have urged him to give no indication that we have in contemplation a scheme for&quot;bringing the leaders into the Executive Council since itis most desirable that hopes should not be unduly excitedin India before ycu yourself have bad the opportunity ofexploring the ground with Congress and Dee Muslim League.Finally the hope was expressed that you would be able soto arrange matters that a suggestion for co-operation on thelines of the Zafrullah scheme should come from the indian leaders and not be suggested, to them by you.In the event of an eventual breakdown of these effortsat conciliation you may count on the support of the Cabinetin such measures to maintain law and order as you may findnecessary.

1128XXXTelegram from Viceroy dated 28th October,   1939*Private and personal.    Many thanks for your private and personal telegram of 26th October, 812.    I am veryfateful indeed for Cabinet decision and for your assistancein securing it.    I fully appreciate their attitude asregards Commander-in-Chief and will act accordingly.2.     I will now approach Gandhi and Jinnah as suggested..I think in justice to ourselves, we must consider furlpublicity for moves we are now making, and I will telegraphfurther about this when I have had more time to  consider it.5.     I may not find it too easy to secure that suggestion for co-operation on the lines of the Zafrullah scheme shallcone from Indian leaders but I will do my best about this.I have it in mind to get Erskine to hint to Pajagopalachari,who strongly urged expansion of Centre in his interview with me&apos;, that he should again urge this through Gandhi as representing in the light of how-re * s speech what would on the face of it seem most profitable line of advancewithin the Act.^     I am profoundly grateful to you and to  Cabinet forassurance stated in last paragraph of your telegram.5*     Erskine&apos;s ministers have now tendered their resignation.- Gathered from him that Pajagopalachari comments that Hoare&apos;speech, while a very good one,  is not very different from my statement.    It is unfortunate that they should be goingou*&apos; aut if matters improve it is an easy matter to withdrawProclamation and let them return to office.    There may well

be come plan from Gandhi!s point of view as againstleft ring in letting things reach a point at whichresignations are tendered, or even accepted.    I understand thatjinnah in private conversation says that he does not regardHoare&apos;s statement as advancing matters so far as heis concerned.    He has issued statement to thQeffect that lie refrains from comment on debate until he has heard further from me on League resolution.

111+2XTelegram from Viceroy dated 31st October, 1939*2i;72-S.    Gandhi and fta jendra Prasad have nowformally accepted my invitation, and meeting takes-place to-morrow morning.    dinner, intimates that as hehas full powers vested in him by Moslem League hesees no need to bring a companion.    I have notin these circumstances pressed for Sikander, butam keeping latter in touch through Craik.    I willtelegraph further once meeting is over.2.    I propose, if all goes well, to suggest briefcommunique on conclusion of meeting to the effectthat discussions of a general character took place and v/ill be resumed later, but also to warn myvisitors that I contemplate a fuller    announcementgiving gist of proposition put to them at alater stage.

1145XXXTelegram from Viceroy dated 2nd November 1939. I saw to-day Gandhi, Tajendra Prasad and Jinnah,t read to them a carefully prepared statement, text ofwhich I will send you by tomorrow&apos;s bag, on general lines which had been agreed between us and approved by theCabinet.   I bad reached clear conclusion that it washopeless to try to get them to move first as regards theCentre, and I accordingly made the first move myself, butin such manner as to make any proposals for advance thereproposals to be put forward in agreement by parties within limits approved by the Cabinet, and to make theirsubmission wholly dependent on prior settlement of provincial differences.2. The parties asked for time to think, and wentaway together.    They have asked me for concrete statementof my suggestion, without prejudice, and I will give themthis.   I am very doubtful indeed as to prospect of asettlement.   Rajendra Prasad commented that proposition asregards Centre went a long way to meet earlier Congressdemand for some immediate application of a satisfactorydeclaration; but that oosit ion as regards adequacy of delclaration remained as before.,    Gandhi equally took theline that proposals merited most careful consideration,out underlined that they really proceeded on the basisLhat declaration was fairly satisfactory and that we were proceeding from that point to some more liberal arrange-n^ at the Centre for the period of the war, whereasCon-gress bad decided to take a different view of thedeclaration.Jinnah laid down again that solution of difficultiesProvinces was entirely in the hands of Co-ngress.   If-gress could solve those, there would be a good basis for

both parties putting their heads together to device a schemfor the Centre within the framework of the Act (his use ofthese last words is of course important).   He commentedhowever on the fact that Congress were not apparentlysatisfied with the declaration and had not acknowledgedthe position in regard to responsibility in the provinces.4.      Gandhi indicated in terms that section 93 was theappropriate course to resort to where Ministries hadtendered resignations.    The course it represented was, hesaid, provided in the Act, and was not in the leastmisunderstood, and Madras precedent was the right one tofollow.   He showed no disposition to mark time as regardsresignations while our discussions were proceeding; and Ithink it would he a mistake on our part in these circum-stances -to take the initiative.    I will telegraph to youseparately on this point.5.      Discussion was very friendly, but I should regard theprospect of parties reaching agreement as small.   We canhowever claim to have done all in our power to bring theparties together and to have put forward a reasonable(? to do omitted)proposition.   For the moment there is nothing/but to awaitdevelopments.

1152XXXTelegram from Viceroy dated 2nd November 1939.2501-11Private and per serial.   Secret,    I have just received following letter which I repeat at once, andwhich is marked personal on envelope from Gandhir   Begins&quot;Dear Lord Linlithgow,   Your suggestion seems to befraught with grave danger.    It is wrong to invite Congress,and League to adjust their differences about Provincialadministration and then to put up a joint scheme regardingthe Centre.   We shall never come-to an agreed settlement in the matter suggested by you.    It is the old way.    Ithas proved a veritable curse.    The present way is way to(? domination) by Congress.   True solution can only comehy an elected Assembly framing charter of freedom.    Itcannot frame one without carrying real minorities with it.The British way leads to perpetual wrangling.I hope you will forgive this intrusion.    This is wholly ray own thought.   Rajendra Babu will see this note.The official letter he may send tomorrow.   He has invitedPandit Nehru and Maul ana Azad to come to New Delhitomorrow.   I am, Yours sincerely, MJC*-Gandhi.   Ends.

Telegram from Viceroy dated 2nd November 1939*2502-8^Following is text of letter I have to-day sent to ghandi, Rajendra Prasad and Jinnah.    Begins.    &quot;You will remember that I agreed during our conversation yesterdayto let you have in concrete form the proposition whichI -put to you and other gentlemen who were present at themeeting, emphasising that I did so with a genuine desireto help, a desire fully shared hy H.M.G.2.     The proposition which I invited you and othergentlemen present to consider,  as leaders of Congress and moslem League, was that,  given the great importance of ensuring harmonious working at the Centre, you snoulc. ente:upon discussions between yourselves with a viev^ todiscovering whether you could reach a basis of agreementbetween yourselves in the provincial field consequent on which you could let me have proposals which wouldresult in representatives of your two organisationsimmediately participating in Central Government as membersof my Executive Council.    I brought out too,  that in my judgment it ought not to be necessary absolutely to resolve every detail of such differences as may exist in the provinces.    What was required,  as was remarked in course of discussion, was a degree of agreement in respect3f the provinces to make it possible for my visitors,and organisations which they represented,  to putforward a scheme which could be considered for the Centre.3&apos;     I added in regard to any arrangement at the Centre --i^et that one would hope that it might be found

practicable to include also ore or possibly morerepresentatives of other important groups and that thatwas a question on which I should value your advice when we came to grapple with details:  secondly that arrangement which I invited you to consider for the Centre would he anadjitoq arrangement for -period of war and quite (? distinct from) much wider question of constitutional reform at end of war; and I mentioned that on last point mydeclaration had sot out position of II.M. G.    I attach a copyof extracts from that declaration which I brought to thenotice of the meeting yesterday; thirdly that positionof anyone appointed to my Executive Council as a Memberof a political party would ho identical in privilegeand in obligation with that of existing members of my council;  and fourthly that arrangement would he withingeneral ccheme of existing law.    It would he admittedlyand inevitably a males shift arrangement for duration of campaign.    I brought out that what was required now,if we could get a workable scheme together, was to put it into operation with as little delay as possible pendingmore general view of whole constitutional position whichK.M.G. have expressed their readiness to undertakeafter conclusion of hostilities.k-      I think above makes position clear.    Let me inconclusion repeat that, as I said yesterday,  I am atany time at your disposal or that of other gentlemen whoattended our meeting, whether jointly or singly,  to give any assistance in my power in reaching conclusions on theseKiost important matters.    I feel certain,  as I saidyesterday,  that suggestions I have put to you,  reflecting

as they do very real and substantial evidence of anxietyof H.M.G.  to reach a complete understanding, will receivefull and. sympathetic consideration from you.-5.        I am sending a similar letter to Mr. Gandhi and dr. Rajendra Prasad.&quot;    Ends *Extracts from my declaration enclosed with this letter are (l)  Paragraph 11 omitting words ;&apos;3e that as itmay&quot; and words &quot;to which I have just referred.&quot;,  (2)  paragraph12 down to and including words &quot;towards her goal&quot;,  (o)following words &quot;I remarked finally,  speaking of the demandsof minorities for an assurance that full weight wou.ld begiven to their views and. interests&quot;,  then insert last sentence of paragraph 12 of declaration.NOTE.The extracts referred, to above read as follows:-II.    His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that when thetime comes to resume consideration of the plan, for the futurefederal government of India,  and. of the plan destined togive effect to the assurances given in Parliament by thelate Secretary of State,  it will be necessary to reconsiderin the light of the then circumstances to what extent thedetails of the plan embodied in the Act of 1935 remainappropriate.       And I am authorised now by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to say that at the end. of the war they will bevery willing to enter into consultation with representativesor the several communities, parties and interests in Indiaand with the Indian Princes,  with, a view to securing theiraid and co-operation in the framing of such modifications as may seem desirable.12.    I have, I trust,  in what I have just said, made clear that the intention and anxiety of His Majesty&apos;s

Government is, as stated in tne Instrument of Instructionsto the Governor-General, to further the partnership hetweenIndia and the United Kingdom within the Empire to theend that India may atain her due place amongst the greatDominions-      The scheme of government embodied in theAct of 1935 was designed as an essential stage in thatprocess.      But I have made clear in what I have just saidthat His Majesty1s Government will, at tho end of the war,be prepared to regard the scheme of the Act as open to modification in the light of Indian views;    and I wouldmake it clear,  too,  that it will he their object,  as atall times in the past it has heen,  to spare no pains to further agreement by any means in their power in the hopeof contributing to the ordered and harmonious progress ofIndia towards her goalo      (I remarked finally,  speakingof the demands of miner!tiles for an assurance that full weight would he given to their views and interests)-     Itis unthinkable that we should now proceed to plan afresh,or to modify in any respect, any important part of India&apos;future Constitution without again taking counsel with thosewho have in the recent past been so closely associated ina like task with His Majesty&apos;s Government and with Parliament.

Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of Statedated Slid. November 1939.25183o.     Private and personal*      I am keepingyou in touch with developments in various Provinces.There has been no move to me here today from either party.     But I understand from Jinnah that he findsCongress completely ohstinate as regards (a)  declaration,(h) his claim to represent Moslems.      I  gather fromother sources that he is represented by Congress asequally obstinate as regards their claim (a)  fordeclaration,  (b)  for constituent assembly or similarbody.     He has had two,  if not three, visits fromGandhi and a long discussion with Nehruo

1161XXXTelegram from Viceroy, dated 3rd November,19392527-S.Private and personal.      Situation this morningappears still to he that no accommodation has heen reached on the part of Congress and Moslem League,   and that each party is still insisting on its own claims.      Gandhihowever is alleged to he spending a couple of days longerhere.      Jinnah tells me he will let me know if and whenhe desires a further interview,  either accompanied or without Congress.2. Impression I get is that both parties are experiencingdifficulties.      Great attention is being focussed on these discussions.     Absence of Moslem press accounts for Congresspoint of view, and criticisms of Moslems receiving more attention than facts justify.      I have endeavoured to hintto press desirability of urging on leaders the importanceof understanding at this stage and discredit to indian political parties of complete failure to reach agreement.I should not he surprised if matters were reaching a point at which,  given complete inability to come together,   anddesirability at the same tome of reaching some understanding,both parties might he prepared to consider some middle course.     Meanwhile, I have had feelers (though I suspectwith nothing behind them)  from Krishnama-charities and MirzaIsmail.     Both are clearly perturbed at position StatesWay occupy if British India now reaches an internalagreement and states are outside.      Ismail is very anxious that States should he represented in any expanded Council*Krishnama-charities favours the possibility of immediateWove into Federation, and is fairly snaguino about success,provided that definite hopes can bo held out of meeting

- 2 -the Princes as regards qualified method of protectingtheir treaty rights.      I think there is beginning to bea feeling amongst the Princes that they may have missedthe bus.3, Even if I receive a negative reply from gandhi and Jinnah, I do not think we can afford, or wisely agree,to allow these negotiations to break down and to adopta purely negative attitude towards constitutional advance and association of popular opinion in India with theconduct of the war.      That has always, as you know, beenmy view,  and it is strengthened by turn of debate inLords yesterday (In which incidentally I should like to thank you for your admirable speech) .     V/e have deliberatelypostponed Federation on the ground that war (corrupt group)S would make it impossible for us to proceed with detailed work involved.     But that was two months ago,  and much has happened since then.      We may well find ourselves obligednow to conduct constitutional investigations,  at least asdistracting as any in connection with Federation would havebeen.       In these circumstances would the Cabinet,  do you think, be prepared to allow me to have a shot at very earlyFederation under the Act if there seems the least prospectof a move in that direction?      If so,  I would wait untilI had thought moment had come and then proceed on something-like these lines:(a) prepare the way as best I may with thee Princes(?saying)      (This time I hope they v/ilS. believe meunless they are very obtuse indeed)   tha&quot;  this isthe last chance for terms of offer.(b) v/arn Moslems that so far as their plan fordivision of India. 1 s concerned they are ridingfor a fall and advise them rather to secure

themselves by appropriate securities taken from congress and with the Princes with whom they arealready in close contact and sympathy;(c)- get the Princes and Congress together informallypreferably through Dewans. Congress would haveto have a facesaver of some sort;(d)    if things move well,  announce early that H.M. G.feel that degree of agreement that has.been reachedamongst the parties taken with their own extremeanxiety to bring in all parties,  and the Princeson the same basis, in connection with the prosecution of the war, produce situation inwhich practical    difficulties felt in an earlier stage about proceeding at once with the federalplan is removed and that they propose to expediteconsummation of Federation by all means in their power.5. I foresee that one matter on which we are likely tobe pressed in the event of any such arrangement is directelection for the Assembly.      It might be necessary toconsider some arrangement    about that.       But important as thatissue is,  it is one relatively of minor importance in relationto the major considerations which we have at the moment toweigh.      One possibility,  if it looked like being of materialimportance to make a concession over it,  would be given thetime necessary to devise constituencies and prepare anelectoral roll, to accept the principle as from secondelection, but conduct the first election under the schemeQf the Act in the interest of speed.     But I will telegraphseparately at greater leisure on this and. other aspects.6* Could you let me have the earliest possible reply tothis,  (?f or)  if there is any tiring to be said for proceeding

on the lines which I suggest (end I repeat that contingent;authority to do so might he of utmost value), it isessential that I should know whore I stand at once,since these discussions between Congress and Moslems may&quot;break up at any time, and I am also anxious to turn to advantage the presence in Delhi for a couple of dayslonger of Mirza Ismail and Krishriaraa -llarit

1165XXXTelegram from Viceroy dated 3rd November 1939.2536^Private and personal.      Latest information suggeststhat some impression has been made on Jinnah by congress in regard to his claim to be formally accepted as solespokesman of Moslems, and that extent to which congress leaders have had to come to him and negotiate with him in last couple of days might be regarded by him as adequate recognition in the eyes of India and the World,of his special position.2.     I have no information as to stage which generaldiscussions between Jinnah and Congress have reached.I have just had a message from Jinnah that he discussedmatter further with Nehru this morning and that heunderstands that Congress propose to reply by letter.He suggests that once I have seen their reply I shouldlet him know whether I would see him personally or wouldlike him to put his views in writing.     He added that congress continue to press their demand for declaration.This does not look to me very much as accommodationbetween two parties.3.      If my assumption that accommodation has not infact been reached is correct and there is immediatebreakdown, I would propose at once to broadcast,  setting out very briefly the history of this business,  theproposal of sections (sic) put to the two parties andoutcome of (?discussion);    saying a heavy responsibilityrests upon all at this time;    that I greatly regret,  aswe must all do,  in the future interests of India,  that further progress has not been possible;    but that Ido not propose to allow myself to be discoui -3ged,  and th

- 2 -I propose to continue to examine in what manner thesituation, revealed, &quot;by the breakdown of these conversations, can be met.      I think it very importantif there is in fact a breakdown that I should be able toact on these lines as quickly as possible.      I thinkit equally of great importance that door should beleft open.4.      I understand Rajagopalachari has now been asked by Gandhi by telegram to come to Delhi,  and is due toarrive tomorrow morning.

1168XTelegram from Viceroy, dated 4th November,1939.fFollowing is text of Congress reply which I have just received.     Begins.    Birla House, New Delhi,November 3rd,  1939.      Dear Lord Linlithgow,I thank you for your letter of November 2nd embodyingin concrete form the proposition which you had placed beforeus when we saw you on November 1st.     My colleagues and Ihave given our earnest consideration to it.      . e have had.also the advantage of full talks with Mr. M.A.  Jinnah.But we find ourselves unable to vary the answer we gaveyou during the interview.At the outset I would like to say that both GandhiJ.I. and I missed at the interview any reference to mainand moral issue raised, by Congress about clarification ofwar aims without which   it was impossible for Congress toconsider any subsidiary proposal.The present crisis has arisen owing to the outbreakof war in Europe and action of British Government indeclaring India a belligerent country without consent ofIndian people.    This crisis is entirely political and. is notrelated to communal issue in India. -   It raised vitalquestions in regard to war aims of British Government and position of India in relation to them.      The CongressWorking Committee, as you are aware,  issued a lengthystatement on September 14th,  1939,  in which they invitedBritish Government to declare these war aims and, inParticular, how these aims were going to apply to Indiaand to be given effect to in the present.      It was further^ated that Indian people must have right of self-determination kiy framing their own constitution through a

constituent Assembly, without external interference, andshould guide their own policy.      On October 10th,  1939,the All-India Congress Committee, approved of and endorsedthis statement, and stated, that In the declaration to be made by the British Government, India   must be declared an ind.epend.ent nation and present application should be given to this status to large (?st)  possible extent.      The Committee further added that Indian freedommust he based on democracy and unity and full recognitionand protection of rights of (?  all) minorities.Subsequent to this,  the policy of the BritishGovernment was declared in the Viceregal statement, extracts from which you have been good enough to send me.      this statement was considered by Congress Working Committeesoon after and. Committee expressed their opinion thatit was unfortunate and. wholly unsatisfactory.      As a consequence of this,  they felt compelled to declare thatthey were unable to give any support to Great Britain andto call upon Provincial Governments,  in the Provinceswhere Congress is in a majority,  to tender their resignations.It is worthy of note that Viceroy&apos;s declaration ofBritish policy met with disapproval of overwhelming bodyof opinion in India, even outside the Congress.Subsequent statements made on behalf of the BritishGovernment in Parliament have not made any essential difference to the policy outlined in the   Viceroy1sstatement,  and as you have rightly pointed, out,  that policyis still governed by extracts from it that you have kindlysent us.      I am afraid it is quite impossible for us toaccept this policy or to consider any steps to further&apos;co-operation unless the policy of the British Government&quot;is made clear in a declaration on the lines suggested by

It has pained us to find the communal question-being dragged in in this connection.     It has cloudedthe main issue.     It has been repeatedly said on behalfof Congress that it is our earnest desire to settle all points of communal controversy hy agreement and we proposeto continue our efforts to this end.     But I would pointout that this question does not in any repect come in theway of a declaration of Indian freedom as suggested above.Such declaration applies to the whole of India and notto any particular community; and. constituent assembly which will frame India&apos;s constitution, will be formedon the&quot;widest po sfble basis of franchise and by agreement in regard to communal representation.     We are all agreed that there must be full protection of minorityrights and interests and. this protection should beby agreement between parties concerned.      The BritishGovernment taking or sharing the burden has,  in ouropinion, made a settlement of question much more difficultthan it should- have been.      It should allay all realanxiety on the part of British Government when Congressdeclares, that it contemplates no constitution which doesnot carry with it the protecting of real minorities to thensatisfaction.It seems to us that a clear declaration of thekind suggested is an essential preliminary to any furtherconsideration of the matter.      I  should like to add that recent developments in European war have made it all themore necessary for a clear enunciation of war aims.      Ifa satisfactory declaration is made,  a discussion of proposal made by Your Excellency will be  appropriate and useful and we shall be glad to discuss it with you.

It is perhaps unnecessary to state that Gandhi J.I..is in full agreement with this letter.     \7e propose toleave tomorrow evening for Wardha unless Your Excellencydesires otherwise *Yours sincerely Rajendra Prasado    Ends.
