Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare1.      Prom the negotiations which have taken place withthe Swedish Mission in London,  it is apparent that,  althoughIthe Swedes are entirely favourable to the Allied cause,  the key to the Swedish attitude is fear of Germany.2.      The following facts have emerged as to the positionadopted by the Germans:-(a) The Swedes have been constantly and specifically in-formed that any substantial interference with Germansupplies of Swedish Iron Ore would be treated as a hostile act and followed by military reprisals.(b) The Swedes have been asked to indicate a figure forthe minimum quantity of Iron Ore to be exported toGermany from each iron mine during the year 19UO.The Germans have mentioned 3,000,000 tons as the smallest figure they are willing to consider fromthe Northern Minefields alone0(c) The Germans have agreed to double,  at their own expense,  the existing railway facilities betweenthe Northern mines and Lulea which are the propertyof the Swedish State Railways.(d) The Swedes have been asked to make certain capitalexpenditure to increase the port facilities atLulea.      At moderate cost,  these could be madesufficient to enable as much Ore to be shipped from Lulea and the other Baltic Ports during the ice-free periods as was formerly shipped to germany from Narvik and the Baltic Ports during the entireyear-

The Swedes state that they have pleaded inahilityto quote figures to the Germans for their minimum sales of iron Ore to them and have refused the proffered railway facilities on the ground that acceptance would he an unneutralact, ...   They further state that no capital expenditure will hepermitted at Lulea.h.      They have,  however,  entirely refused all oursuggestions regarding limitation of sales of Iron Ore toGermany and insist that this commodity is,  like the otherSwedish staple products,  to he dealt with under the projectedWar Trade Agreement on the basis of &quot;normal trade&quot;.      Theeffect of this would be to limit sales of Iron Ore to Germanyto the level attained during the year 1938 except that ifsales to the United Kingdom were increased above the 1938figure the Germans would he entitled to a proportionate in-crease.      In addition,  the Swedes have assured us that theywill make as many technical excuses as they can induce theGermans to believe are genuine in order to reduce shipments to Germany below the 1938 levele5o      They maintain that this policy will cause a sub--stantial reduction to be effected in the quantity of Oreshipped to Germany and point out that the September shipmentsamounting to 791?000 tons represent a considerable reductionin comparison with the low figure of 855,000 tons recordedfor September 1938 and a large reduction in comparison withthat of September 1937,  namely 1,029,. 000 tons.      They add that,  although some increase for October is inevitable,  icein the Baltic should moan a very substantial reduction inNovember,  after which,  with normal weather conditions,shipments should &quot;do negligible In amount until the following

- 3 -April.      Their feeling is that, by that time, the strategicalposition may well have altered in favour of the Allies suf-ficiently to enable them to adopt an attitude more likely tomeet with our approval.6.      It is strongly recommended that the indefinite and unsatisfactory assurances offered by the Swedes upon this important question should be accepted by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.7.      If they are accepted it will be possible to concludein the near future a War Trade Agreement on by no means unsatisfactory lines which could be defended against any Germancharge of lack of neutrality on the part of Sweden but whichwould yet confer substantial advantages upon the Allies and could be determined at short notice if any change in themilitary situation made it possible to obtain better terms.8. &apos;    If,  on the other hand,  the assurances are not accepted it will be impossible to conclude a War Trade Agree--ment with Sweden and the two alternatives open to us wouldthen be either to let things slide or to put pressure on the swedes.9.      In the former case,  we might avoid alienation ofthe present favourable Swedish opinion but our enemy wouldbe able to obtain unlimited supplies of many importantoommodities.10J      In the latter case,   our only weapon v/ould be tointerfere with Swedish trade and cut off supplies so far aspossible,      The use of this weapon is not likuly to be very-effective for the follov/ing reasons :-(a) There are technical difficulties (not necessarily in-superablo) in interfering with cargoes carried to a neutral/

- h -neutral destination in a neutral ship.(b) Sweden has laid in substantial stocks of most of herdeficiency commodities so that our unofficial &quot;blockade&quot;could hardly become a serious embarrassment to Swedenfor at least eighteen months.(c) Sweden would probably retaliate by depriving us ofcertain Swedish supplies v/hich are almost vital toour armaments industry (e.g. Perro-chrome and CharcoalPig-iron).(d) We should be assisting German exports at the expenseof our own.(e) We should be alienating Swedish public opinion andthis could hardly fail to react unfavourably upon theopinion of the other Northern Neutrals.(f) Pressure directed by us against the neutral policy ofone of the Northern countries would be violentlyresented in the United States.      There are approxi-mately as many Swedes settled in the United States as there are in the whole of Sweden.11.      The result of our use of this weapon would thus be either to drive Sweden into the hostile camp or to force her to yield to our pressure (this alternative is unlikely forthe reasons given above),  in which latter case Germany mightwell fulfil her threats and attack Sweden.      It would bedifficult for us to give effective help at present,  and sweden would probably be overrun or reduced by attacks fromthe air.      Either result would enable Germany sooner or later to obtain all Swedish supplies without restriction.It/

- 5 -12.      It is submitted that the halance lies in favourof accepting the Swedish assurances and for a limited periodwatching how the Swedish assurances are implemented andwhether Germany&apos;s ability to reduce Sweden to a second Polandis maintained.      The development during that period ofRusso-Scandinavian and Russo-German relations would he a material factor.13.      Lastly,  it must be remembered that,  if it he decided to accept the Swedish assurances,  the resultingWar Trade Agreement will certainly affect the attitude ofother Neutrals and particularly the Northern Neutrals.We shall have set a precedent for working out a type of war trade Agreement which,  while establishing fully the principleof restricting Germany&apos;s imports, will enable the neutralpower to preserve,  to a great extent,  the standard of life of its people and to maintain fully its strictly neutralattitude,,      Further,  we shall he in a position to extend theprinciple of restriction at short notice when the strategical situation makes it possible for us to do so.(Initialled) R.H.C.31st October,  1959.
