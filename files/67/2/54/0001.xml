C.L.WAR   CABINET,PRISONERS OP WARcCOPY NO.    &apos; &amp;Report by the Standing ministerial committee on Military Co-ordination.It will be recalled that at the Meeting held on the11th November4&quot; the War. Cabinet was informed that the DeputyChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had examined the questionOf interviews with, and photographs of, German Prisoners ofWar, and had recommended that representatives of the Press;should not be allowed access to enemy Prison Camps.The War Cabinet agreed that the whole question should!be examined by the Military ;Co-ordination Committee.2.      The recommendations put forward by the Deputy Chiefsof Staff were, in summary, as follows:-&quot;(a)    That no access to German prisoners of war should be permitted to representatives ofthe Press.4- W.M.   (39) 79th Conclusions, Minute 6.

(to) That no photographs of German prisoners ofwar should be released for publicationuntil after the names of the prisonersconcerned have been released for trans-mission to Germany.(c) That when any photographs of German prisonersof war were required for propaganda pur-poses, arrangements for obtaining them would be made by the Service department concerned.(d) That when any interviews with German prisonersof war were required for propaganda pur-poses, they would be conducted by officersof the Service Department concerned.(e) To record the view that photographs of pri-soners should be of the type calculated torebut the stories of brutality to pri-soners deliberately spread by the Germans.In this connection, recent photographswhich had appeared in the Press showingprisoners at work behind barbed wire, etc.were not considered to be the typerequired.&quot;3- We regard it as most undesirable that the unfortunateposition of the prisoner of war should he exploited in anywayj    and we therefore endorse   the above recommendations.4.        We were told that the United States Press haverecently referred - doubtless as a result of german propaganda organisations in the country - to the goodtreatment meted out to British prisoners of war inGermany;    and we were informed that representatives ofthe United States Press in England, of pro-Britishtendencies, had asked for facilities to visit german prisoners of war in this country, in order to enablethem to counter this propaganda by emphasising theiexcellent treatment which German prisoners of war were receiving at our hands.5* It would not, in our view, be possible to grantfacilities to the neutral Press which we refused to ourown.     We therefore consider that the regulationsrecommended in paragraph 2 should apply to British and neutral Press alike.

Initialled on behalf ofthe Committee.C.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,18th November, 1939-some advantage in allowing the accredited representativesof a neutral power to visit enemy prisoners of war inthis country, provided that representatives of the samePower were given similar facilities by the GermanGovernment to visit British prisoners of war in Germany.We recommend that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be invited to put forward this propositionin whatever way he considers best.7- To sum up, we recommend:-(a) That no access to German prisoners of warin Great Britain should be permitted to representatives of the Press, eitherBritish or foreign.(b) That when a.ny photographs of German prisonersof war are required for propaganda purposes, arrangements for obtaining them should be made by the Service Departmentsconcerned.      Similarly,  interviews with german prisoners should be conducted by officers of the Service Departments.(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be invited to make itknown that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be willing to give facilitiesfor the accredited representatives ofa Neutral Power to visit enemy prisonersof war in this country, while expressing the hope, at the same time, that theNeutral Power concerned would request the German Government for similar facilities to visit British prisonersof war in Germany.
