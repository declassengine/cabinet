COPY NO.WAR CABINET.AIR TRAINING SCHEME memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air,1,        At their meeting on 30th October (WcMo65(39) Minute 2),the War Cabinet gave authority for Lord Riverdale&apos;s mission to negotiate a settlement of the cost of the Dominion air training Scheme in Canada on the basis of the following alloca-tion of expenditure:-UoKhCanadaAusTraljia *)New Zealand )TOTALMillions0 221  50 million)S&apos; 343- 0 3434-Sf 908,2, Since neither Australia nor New Zealand is in a positionto provide dollars, the War Cabinet agreed that we should beprepared, if necessary, to advance the dollar payment to beborne by these two Dominions, the sum so advanced to be repaidat some later date in sterlingo     The provision of Canadiandollars for this transaction was accepted as having priority !over other demands, it being understood that the provision of dollars on this scale would involve an equivalent reduction ii -the expenditure in dollars which would be available for otherwar purposeso3.        The first reactions of the Canadian Government to theproposals in paragraph 1 above were unfavourable,,    They repre-sented inter alia, that a commitment of the size involved was quite beyond their capacity, having regard to their other warcommitments and to their national income0       Later discussions,which had in the meantime been joined by the Missionsfrom Australia and New Zealand, have however run asmoother course a These later discussions have led to some

modification in the Air Training Scheme as originallyplanned.     The scope of the scheme as a whole remains, I am glad to say, unchanged hut there is to he a reduction in theamount of training to he carried out in Canada with acorresponding increase in the amount of training to he carried out in Australia and New Zealand^      The net effect has been to reduce the estimated total cost of the scheme in Canada from 0 M.90&apos;8 to 0 M.650.4. Tentative agreement has been reached in Canadafor the sharing of this expenditure on the following basis s-Millions0U.K. 0 318 (of which all except 23will represent sterlingpayments)uCanada, 0 313Australia. q&apos; no new &quot;Zealand.0 650It is also proposed that the United Kingdom shall contributeequipment to the value of about  44- million to the cost oftraining in Australia and New Zealand05. It will be seems-(a) that Canada is now prepared to bear a very substantial share of the cost of the scheme,and(b) that our liability to produce dollar exchangehas been reduced from 0 M,343^ to 0 M.142.6. The proposed settlement may, I think, be regardedas a reasonable solution of a very difficult problem.     Theagreement of the Canadian Government is, however, made subject to two conditions s-(i)   That the financial discussions now takingplace in London on the question of our economic war-time relations with Canada leadto a mutually satisfactory agreement

(ii)    That the Canadian Government receives an assurance &quot;Inch they arc to he at liberty to announce, if they so wish, that in the opinionof His Majesty1s Government in the United Kingdom^the Air Training Scheme has preference over anyother commitment in Canada&apos;s efforts other thanthose already entered into.-.7, As regards the first of these conditions, theCanadian Government desire that the discussions shall takeplace with - r% Crerar and Mr,, Towers, the Governor of theBank of Canada.     The latter arrives in London on Wednesdaynight next, and I understand from the Treasury that they proposeto open discussions on Thursday0      I also understand that theposition is by no means satisfactory from the Treasury pointof view,,8. It appears that the Canadian Government were, at onetime, prepared to give us financial assistance, by way of loans, to the extent,  in the first year of war, of 0 237millions,,     But the latest messages indicate that they intend to deduct from their loans to us the whole of their ownexpenditure under the Air Training Scheme... amounting under the revised proposals to $ 513 millions in 3 years a     Unless theycan he induced to drop this proposal, it is obvious that theexecution of the Scheme, even with its reduced dollar commitments,will mean a much heavier reduction in our other purchases inWorth Imevlca than has yet been contemplatedo3* As regards the second condition, it will be recalled that the Canadian Prime&apos; Minister tried to get a similar state-went introduced into the announcement I made in the House ofCommons on the Air Training Scheme,      He -wanted us to say that,ih our opinion, the Scheme would &quot;constitute the most essential and decisive effort that Canada could put forth in the field ofMilitary co-operation&apos;10      The War Cabinet took exception to thisproposal (W.1.1.43(59) : :i.ir.:te 2) mainly on the ground that itmight result in Caxiadu hot sending an Expeditionary Force overseas.

10, It is troublesome of Mr, Mackenzie King to repeat his earlier request, even in its modified form,but I feel that to meet it now will not be open to quitethe same objection as on the previous occasion, inthat Canada has already agreed to send an ExpeditionaryForce overseas.     Moreover, as indicated in paragraph2 above, we ourselves have since, in effect, agreedthat the Air Training Scheme should have priority over other demands.     In any event, it seems to medifficult to reject Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s request and,on the whole, I suggest that we might accept it.(Intdo)   K.W.ir Ministry,18th November, 1939.
