w  r 7(this document IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)^v(G)( 59)57.WAR    CABINET.BROADCAST TALKS 3Y CABINET MINISTERS- AND --OTHER GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES.Note by the Secretary covering;Memorandum by the Prime Minister.I circulate herewith, by direction of thePrime Minister,  a Memorandum on the Subject ofBroadcast Talks by Cabinet Ministers and other government Representatives,,(Signed)&apos;   E, S.  BRIDGES.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.25th October,  1939.

BROADCAST TALKS BY CABINET ministers and OTHER GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES,K? Tier an dan &quot;by the Prime Minister,It is,  I think, necessary to review withoutdelay the arrangements for the inclusion in B.B.C.programmes of talks to &quot;be given &quot;by Ministers and departmental officials.In the first place,  it has been suggested tome that for the purpose of keeping the country fully informed about the progress of the war and so helping to maintain public morale it would be desirable toarrange a series of talks to be given at regular intervals by members of the War Cabinet.      I think this is a good suggestion which should be adopted.In the second place, there are naturally manymatters for which, in war time, Ministers and their departments wish to secure the special publicity which broadcasting alone can give.      This is alreadyleading to a considerable increase in the number oftalks for which the B.B.C,  are asked to find time.A large increase in the demand for programmetime for official talks inevitably creates serious difficulties for the B.B.C.  and these difficulties are very greatly magnified by the fact that thereis now only one programme service,  and by otherdisabilities which war time conditions impose uponthe broadcasting system,,      It must also be rememberedthat if more time is allocated to broadcast talks by ministers, more time may have also to be given to opposition spokesmen,

I have accordingly asked the Lord Privy seal to undertake,  in consultation with the Minister ofInformation and the Directorate of Radio relations of the Ministry,  a general supervision over thearrangements for the programme of Ministerial talks.It is contemplated that these arrangements will include a fortnightly review by a member of the WarCabinet of the course of the war and that in thealternate fortnight there will be a more immediatelytopical talk by some other member of the Government.No reference should be made in a talk to foreignaffairs without prior consultation with theSecretary of State.      All these talks would takeplace on Wednesday evenings.      If, outside theseseries,  a Minister desires to give a broadcast talk,I shall be glad if he will discuss the proposal inthe first instance with the Lord Privy Seal,  thoughit will be appreciated that the number of such additional talks will have,  of necessity,  to be strictly limited.      Arrangements for talks bydepartmental officials will, no doubt, normally bemade direct with the Directorate of Radio relations at the Ministry of Information, but if difficulties arise they can be referred to the Lord Privy Seal.The Lord Privy Seal proposes at once to draw up,in consultation with the Ministers concerned,  a programme for the series of Wednesday evening talks.He should be informed by Ministers of any proposals that they may have for talks so that he can draw upa programme month by month,(Intdo)    N.C.g5thj)october. 1959.
