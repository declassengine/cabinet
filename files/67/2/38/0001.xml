The following is a broad outline 01 the steps which havebeen and are being taken to bring )r,o.c,e to all members of thecommunity the need for refraining from the discussion of confidential matters in public places,.

(&amp;y jufprnhers of His ha.iegtv&apos;s Forces.e        Steps taken by the Defence Departments in respect of.5*members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces have been most thorough and com-prehensive.     Examples include a notice parted in the pay booksof all Army personnel;    special letters to Commands and Districtsa general signal which was issued to the whole Fleet;    specialnotices enjoining particular secrecy in such matters as mobilisa-tion end the embarkation of the Expeditionary Force,    and thedisplay of notices and posters in hotels and public places in allgarrison towns.6,       The Admiralty, War Office ana hinistry of Supply have, inparticular, paid special attention to the need for caution in theuse of the telephone, and have affixed special notices totheir instruments, both at home and in the Field. Similar steps are being taken by the Air Ministry.(k)   Civil Service.7.        Under the pro vis i ons ^ of the Government-War Book all&quot;Departments were requiree. to warn their staffs, both during the precautionary Stage and again after the outbreak of war, of theneed for maintaining secrecy.    The steps which they took differedaccording to their peculiar circumstances, and varied from thogeneral issue of Office Notices to the placing oi a personalnotice in the hands of each individual member cf the staff, whofl d to sign a receipt for it.8*        It is the normal practice of Departments to bring the relevant passages of the Official Secrets Act to the notice ofall new members who join their staff..^)   Merchant Service.Shipowners have been ashed to transmit to the harters of;ttieir vessels a warning against making mention, either in con-] er sat ion, by post, or by telephone, of any matters r els ting to[theue arrival or sailing date;    convoy arrangements;    convoy!assembly ports;    routeing instructions;    and escorts ordements of H.I.I. Ships.

10i     As this warning will take time to reach all those for whom it is intended., a general signal lias meanwhile&quot;been sent by wireless to British merchant vessels in all areas warning them that it is of the utmost importance to avoid indiscreet conversations ashore,particularly in foreign ports, and that they should take every possible step to ensure that their officers andcrews are repeatedly warned of the grave danger toBritish shipping which might result from failure tocomply with this warning.11*     a. suitable coloured poster is to be distributed to every Mercantile marine Office at all.ports in the United Kingdom;    to the hasten of everyBritish ship, when signing on crews, for display in suitable parts of the ship;    to all British ConsularOfficersI    and to all shipping Masters in british ports overseas.(d)     Police and lire Brigades.12.        The liome Office have addressed a circular toall Chief Constables asking them to impress on all members of the Police Force the vital importance ofmaintaining sec^rexiy^^^md emphasising, in particular, theneed for caution in using the telephone.13.     Consideration is being given to the issue of asimilar circular to Chief Officers of Fire Brigades.14.      The Police have also been asked to afford all practicable assistance in the posting of publicnotices enjoining secrecy.

(e)     Civil. ^GfericeruPgj^sjpnneIo.15.      The -xir Ilaid Precautions Department haveissued, a cautionary notice to ^.P..P. personnel againstspreading news of the receipt of a &quot;yellow&quot; air jraidwarningo      Consider at ion.        h.QJ.:ag gt^reh to the fcsftOO of a^ehoroiL instruction calling attention to tho need forseore-cy 6i^-^j2^uar--itta,ttorss and as to whether, it would hepracticable for this instruction to go to each individual volunteer-16.      The Ministry of health are prepared to follow the same line with regard to the Casualty Services,(ismbulahce Service and First aid Posts) as istaken by the A.S.P. DepartmentsXf)     Pac t or i es17.      Special steps to prevent the leakage ofinfoi*aaation by employees of firms engaged on munitions and other secret war work have been taken by theSecurity Service, who have made a particular study ofthis subject and who already had special contacts with90)j of these firms before the outbreak of war,81,000 posters have been distributed to these andother factories by the Ministry of Information..(g) ..  Hotels, public-Eouj^s, and other Public Places.IS.      Posters have been distributed by the Ministryof Information.as follows:-541,000 to Hotels and Publie-Houses.21,000 to Post Offices.50,000 to Local Authorities.5,000 to Labour Lxchaages.4,250 to Railways and Docks.,

ARRANGEMENTS IN HAND.PROPAGANDA.19.       The ministry of Information have the following arrangements in hand to bring the need for secrecy home to the general public:-(i)    A propaganda film.(ii)    Propaganda through the medium of B.B.C.programmes.(iii)    Special articles in the Press.(iv)    Notices to be thrown on to the screens ofcinemas.(v)    An intensification of poster distribution.TELEPHONES.20.    The General Post Office will be placing the followingnotice in all telephone kiosks in all town t.rea.v throughoutthe country:-,: WARNING.&apos;Thousands of lives were lost in the last war because valuable information&apos;was givenaway to the enemy through careless talk.BE    on your    GUARD. &quot;CLUBS.21.       We have given special consideration to the ,uestionof drawing the attention of the members of Clubs to theneed for caution in talking about conii; enticl matters. Clubs,by their very nature, are meeting-places v-here their membersfeel that they are at liberty to speck with less restraintthan they would elsewhere.     Furthermore, the character ofsome, such as the Service Clubs, makes for the discussion ofthose very matters about which reticence is particularly desirable.

22.       Something, therefore, in the nature oi e specialappeal is obviously desirable.     We were informed that the ministerial Committee which considered these questions had such an appeal in mind, end. contemplated that this shouldbe, in the case of certain London Clubs, addressed to the secretaries by the Secretary of the Vi/ar Cabinet.    Afterweighing the &quot;pros and cons&quot; of this suggestionwe are of the opinion that, whilst agreeing that Clubsshould be made the subject of particular treatment, itwould be preferable that this should be done uniformly bythe issue of special notices by the Ministry of Information,as the authority responsible for dec ling with thegeneral public,PUBLIC TRANSPORT VEHICLES.23&apos;     . ^The-JjiLni^trt1-of -Information are responsible for thedisplay of notices In public vehicles, including trains,tubes, buses and trams, and. are ,taking the necessary stepswith the Ministry of Transport for all these cases.24.       It occurred to us that the dimly-lit railwaycarriage    on night  journeys is    a very fertile breeding-ground for indiscreet talk with or in the presence ofstrangers.      The suggestion was accordingly made thatphosphorescent warnings might be placed in railway carriages,but this proposal was rejected, both on account of thecost, and the fact that people would be tempted, to scratchthem off.      Vie feel that the best remedy would be to devisesome means of allowing sufficient light to enable people to read rather than to talk.      In this connexion, we note that the Ministry of Transport have decided to increasethe lighting of&apos;railway carriages on long-ciist&amp;nce nightjourneys, and we therefore hope that the Ministry of home security may see their way to extending this concession tocover all night train journeys.

PUBLICATION OF CONVICTIONS.gg4 We attach great importance to the deterrent effect of giving wide publicity to the publication ofconvictions for breaches of secrecyD    The Home office have accordingly issued instructions to all chief constables to forward reports of proceedings taken under Regulation 3 of the Defence Regulations and theOfficial Secrets Act in connexion with the safeguardi,of information useful to the enemye      These will be passed to the Ministry of Information who will arrangefor suit-able cases to ho glvon prominence hy the Press.EDUCATION OF GENERAL PUBLIC.25,        It has been impressed upon us that publicityof warnings in itself Is not sufficient9 and that thepublic needjguidanc-e.....in what is meant by secret information.     The Security Service are the expertadvisers in this matter.      We have accordingly arranged that the Security Service shall collaborate with theMinistry of Information in the preparation of warnings -of all kinds-. incduding.-articless posters, films and b.B.C. talks - to ensure that these shall be of sucha character as will educate the public abo t the kindof matters which should be kept secret.      As a start5 theSecurity Service have prepared a special note for theMinistry of Information outlining for.the benefit ofthe public, the type of subject on which theirconversation and correspondence should be very discreet.QQN^US^ONS AND .R1MOMENDATIONS.The general conclusion &quot;which we have reachedfrom our enquiry is that the Departments and Defence

Services are very much alive to the need for preve tinsthe leakage of secret information and the discussion of confidential matters in public places9 and that the counter-measures which they have taken to deal with this problem are comprehensive and adequate.jgg* The review which we heve conducted has9 weconsider9 been most useful;    firstly in shewing up ..:idin enabling us to close the few gaps which existed, endsecondly in allowing the Services and Departments anopportunity of exchanging notes and suggestions.     Butwe are now satisfied that no further actions apart fromthat which we have already set in train5 is required.$9*        We agree, however, that it will he necessary tokeep this question under periodical review to ensure thatnotices and warnings retain their effectiveness byrepetition and variety, but we are of the opinion that future action would be more appropriately left to Departmentsthan to a Committee to decide.Recommendations.89*        Our recommendations are therefore as follows:-(i)    The Defence Services,Each of these has its peculiar problems,which differ from those of the other services.     Each,, moreover, is fully alive to its responsibilities, is in close contact with the Security Service, and isthe best judge of its peculiar requirements.We therefore recommend that it should beleft to each to make its own arrangements, ,(i i)   Ciyi1 departments,Here again the situation of each department is different, and varies according to thesear-Gay of the work on which it is engaged.It is. therefore impossible to lay down anyuniform procedure which could be appliedto all.     We are satisfied that theimportance of the need for reticence about

war matters is present in all their minds -with a zeal, even, which has prompted thesuggestion in one quarter &quot;that no person should, without permission, speak to orin any way communicate with any other person on the premises&quot;0We therefore recommend that future actionhy the Civil Departments should he carriedout under general instructions which wouldhe issued hy the Treasury from time totime, hut which would be so framed to leaveeach of them free t-r carry cut the detailsin such manner as might suit its peculiarcircumstances and requirements0/JNOTE,    The Ministry of Information, withthe advice of the Security Service,will undertake the design and productionof posters for the Service and civil departments, who will carry  nit theirown distribution^./&apos;(iii) General Pub2i c aWe recommend(a) That the Ministry of Information shouldbe recognised as the Department primarily responsible for warning the general public against the discussion of confidential matters in public places:(b.) That in exercising this responsibilitythe Ministry of Information should act in close collaboration with theSecurity Service, at all times, andin consultation with otherDepartments, when necessary:(c) That it should he responsible, withthe advice of the Security Service,for the deslgrn, production,, andissue of all security publicity:(d) That it should periodically holdInter-departmental conferences to review the results of its policy,and submit ?eeports,  as necessary,to the War Cabinet-,(Signed) W,S.
