Copy No.   1W.P.j[(39) tOO-.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ITALY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a report which has been prepared byMr. Francis Rodd, of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, on his recent visit toItaly.H.Foreign Office, October 24, 1939.DURING the ten days I was in Rome I saw a limited number of businessfriends of many years&apos; standing, in addition to the officials with whom I wasnegotiating, and as I was living at the Embassy I was able to pass on what 1heard to the Ambassador, who gave me his impressions in daily discussions on my own problems and on the situation generally. I believe that the impressionswhich I received are shared by him and that he would find himself in agreementwith what I have tried to report.The main impression I have is one of fear. The Germans are not liked,though there is both in the Government and in the country a pro-German party which has considerable poAver and influence, and which can be counted on still to make the most of any opportunities it gets. Even among the people who donot like the Germans at all there is an inclination to wonder whether Italy maynot suffer at the hands of Germany for not having come into the war againstthe Allies. This inclination is a product of the fear of Germany itself and aweof German military power, which is widely accepted as being invincible. Oneheard not infrequently that the Germans can break the Western Front, and some people are saying that they would be in Paris by Christmas. The fear of aGerman victory, as distinct from the fear of Germany and all it stands for, is widespread and intense. It is important, because many Italians believe thatwhen Germany has won, a &quot; punitive expedition &quot; against Italy is likely. Even&apos;f this does not take the form of a military adventure, culminating perhaps inthe loss of Trieste to Italy, a German victory would involve the subjection ofItaly to German)&apos; as a vassal State and the loss, not only of independence, but of whatever economic advantages which Italy may have gained during her neutrality.The reaction and consequence of the foregoing is that the Italians wouldprobably in majority prefer to see the Allies win, because they feel that theyWould be better treated, though not necessarily very well treated. But an Alliedvictory equally presents difficulties, especially to the political and party people.Great Britain has declared war, not on Germany but on Nazism. Fascism has10652   [20193]
been the target of abuse and criticism in England. Fascism is related to Nazism.Therefore, if the Allies win and sweep away Nazism, can they be counted uponto preserve Fascism? If they cannot, then Mussolini&apos;s life work will be sweptaway.and a lot of party people will lose their jobs, if not their property andtheir lives. So run the arguments in political thought. It seems to me of first importance that a distinction should gradually come to be drawn in the press and public life of England between Fascism and Nazism, which in many respectscan legitimately be done. But this must be done carefully and tactfully; anysudden enthusiasm for Fascism in England would carry no conviction in a country where, in spite of 18 years of Fascism, individualism and free-thinking are still very much alive.It is this persistence of individual thinking which presents a grave problem to the Government. It has probably given serious food for thought to the Duce.In its refusal to swallow7 with anything except mistrust and dislike the GermanAlliance, Italian public opinion has dominated party discipline and policy. Itis argued, with some evidence of truth, that in effect party discipline has beenweakened. Certain recent incidents seem to confirm this. The troubles reported by the Ambassador between the Army and the Militia have been settled in factin favour of the Army and against the party. The Duce&apos;s speech on the necessityof &quot; cleaning up the street corners,&quot; when people were grumbling, led the localparty secretaries to decide that the &quot; classical Fascist remedies of the stick andcastor-oil&quot; must be resorted to; but the police intervened to squash this zealbecause public opinion would not stand it. And it is understood that Mussolinisupported the police view, presumably from what he knew of the state of publicopinion.There is a good deal of evidence, which has doubtless been reported, that thestate of the Italian Army made war impossible for the country. It is commonlyknown that troops called to the colours are with their units on the frontierswithout uniforms and with no adequate covering. It is common gossip amongthe so-called &quot; well-informed &quot; that the Italian Air Force has only 850 serviceablemachines. There is supposed to be a great deficiency of ammunition in the Army.It is commonly believed that the Duke of Aosta and the Eoyal Family, as well asBalbo in Libya, were against war, and that a war would mean the loss of abyssinia certainly and Libya probably. Whatever may or may not be the truthof these stories, they certainly influenced public opinion against any adventures,but diminished in no way the sense of fear and realisation of Italian difficulties.But the policy of keeping out of the war, whatever the economic advantages which are apparent to all, is no easier. A neutrality benevolent to Germanyexposes Italy to economic pressure by the Allies without providing the money which is so necessary to keep the existing fabric going. Neutrality benevolent tothe Allies exposes Italy to German reprisals and perhaps a military expeditionto Trieste to secure a Mediterranean naval base. If the Italians are aware thatthey were in no position to enter the war against the Allies on the side ofGermany, they are no better placed to fight Germany if attacked. While theyhave not much anxiety of such a development yet, they are fearful of what the spring may bring, more especially if the Germans have decided that it would be too expensive to try to break the Western Front and sit down to a defensive war there.One very senior Italian official said to me : &apos;&apos; We will be neutral; we will be good neutrals; we have our troops on both eastern and western frontiers and moreperhaps on the eastern; but you must not ask us to be hostile neutrals vis-a-visGermany.&quot; The feeling that he may have said a little too much about the eastern frontier in the presence of some twelve other officials, he tried to correct byhastily explaining that the eastern frontier was more difficult to defend than thewestern; whereat nearly everyone began to smile.Thus the way of Italy as a neutral is far from easy and the danger of becoming the nut in the nutcrackers is very present to everyone. Mussolini,during my stay there, said to a friend of mine, who is in very frequent touch withhim on industrial matters &quot; . . . . as long as neither side doesn5t land me aknock-out blow, we shall be able to manage.&quot; The desire and prospects of makingmoney as a neutral are, from the point of view of the Italians, not only pleasantbut perhaps the only method of saving something from the wreck. Italy has beenslowly bled for years, and is now in a pretty precarious economic position.   All
available evidence is that stocks of raw materials are low, manufacturing outputhas had to be reduced for lack of stocks, and the foreign exchange and domesticfinancial situations are bad.In anticipation of the danger of war the Italians reduced their dollar assets in America to vanishing point, and were left in September without enough dollarexchange to meet their loan liabilities in New York on the 1st October. It wasalso too late for them to ship gold in time for it to arrive in New York by thematurity date of certain coupon and sinking fund payments. They managed atthe last moment to scrape up enough to tide them over until some shipments ofo-old, which were immediately arranged, could arrive. They have, however, con-tinued to ship gold in excess of the amount of the remittance due on the 1st Octoberin order to create enough dollar exchange to meet current requirements.They consider that if neutrality can be preserved the prospects are not bad,especially in regard to revenue from shipping, but at the moment exchange isslow in coming in on account of a substantial decrease of exports owing to the uncertainty of the period prior to and after the outbreak of war, and becausemerchants have apparently been slow in paying for the goods that they havealready taken. Tourist traffic of all sorts has, of course, completely ceased, and though there has been some buying of lire in New York and apparently in London,all the information I received goes to show that the exchange situation is verytight. I was given very confidentially to understand that the foreign exchangemedia available at the beginning of October were only a little more than halfwhat they had been on the 31st December last.The Treasury and currency position inside the country is also believed to betight. There was a considerable run on the banks at the beginning of september and deposits then withdrawn have not returned. The Treasury position itself isequally difficult.It is no doubt because of this somewhat critical financial situation generallythat we were able to make such satisfactory arrangements in regard to payments for our purchases in Italy. The long and the short of it is that the Italians have got to sell in order to get enough raw materials to keep their own economy going.If they have, in fact, also made up their minds that they are going to try and keep out of the war, that decision, taken in conjunction with their precariousfinancial situation, accounts for their decision to sell armaments to the Frenchand ourselves. For it follows that, if they have not got enough raw materials and cannot find the means of buying them to manufacture armaments for themselves,there is. no particular reason why they should not sell to us and to the french from existing stocks what they have and seek to manufacture for us if we willsupply the raw material. It is, above all. the raw material to keep industry goingand labour employed which they want. This necessity and a realisation of itaccounts for the Italian authorities&apos; very sensible attitude about payments, thatit is not the money they want but the goods that money will buy, and therefore,if sterling will buy the raw materials, they have no reason to ask for payment inany other currenc)^.From our point of view, it follows that any purchases we can make of warmaterial from the Italians, especially from existing stocks, even if we do not really want them, would be worth doing in order to ensure ourselves against thepossibility of Italy coming in on the side of Germany. Any money so expended(in sterling) is obviously well expended, provided that the danger of the Germansinvading Italy can be warded off, since the prospect of having to arm and financeItaly to resist a German invasion is no more pleasant than the prospect was forthe Germans to have to do the same in order to bring them in on their side.It seems to follow from the foregoing that, in putting pressure on theItalians, pressure should not go beyond the point at which the danger of german military reprisals in italy  is reached.&apos; - FRANCIS RODD.October 20, 1939.
