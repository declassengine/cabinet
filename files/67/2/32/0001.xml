COPY NO.   / ?-     &apos;   i  ------ m ^j^h        ,mm.     - -81*WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES J)F IMPORTED FEEDING STUFFS AND LIVESTOCK POLICYJoint M emorandum. by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries&quot; and the&quot;&quot;s&quot;e&quot;cre&quot;tary of State for Scotland,1, The existing and prospective substantial shortage in supplies of Imported animal feeding stuffs renders necessary, asa matter of urgency, a decision with regard to livestock policywhich has such important economic and political implications thatwe feel it desirable to bring the matter before the War Cabinet.The shortage is at present acute and some shortage must we areinformed be accepted as a continuing feature of war-time economv.In preparing plans for food production in time of war it was recognised by the C, I.D,  that it would have to be assumed thatas a result of enemy action a diminution of the order of atleast 25 per cent, in supplies of imported feeding stuffs woulchave to be faced.     Moreover, it is more economical, when shipping space is limited, to import the finished product e.g, bacon and eggs, rather than the feeding stuffs necessary to produce acorresponding quantity of the product in this country,*     On theother hand it must be realised that the prospective shortage of feeding stuffs involves the forced slaughter of what may be asubstantial proportion of some classes of livestock, and adepletion of our actual and potential home reserves of meat and fats,      it was for this reason that proposals were repeatedly putforward from 1937 onwards for the creation of reserves ofcertain important feeding stuffs.     We pointed out in July and august last that if war occurred in the near future (as it did)there would be an acute shortage of feeding stuffs during theforthcoming winter and that we might be faced with the need to effect a serious reduction in the livestock population within* e,g. At least 6 cwt,  of barley and other cereals arerequired to produce 1 cwt.   of bacon.

the first three to six months of a war.     For various reasonshowever reserves had only attained small dimensions on the outbreak0f war.     Since the war started our Departments have been inconstant contact with the Ministry of Food and have pressedthem to make every effort to increase supplies.     At the sametime farmers have been consistently warned by us personallyand in official propaganda to exercise strict economy in theuse of feeding stuffs of all kinds.     Nothing has been said,however, to indicate that the present acute shortage wouldhe more than temporary,2. Losses by enemy action have, in fact, been insignificantand yet arrivals since the war started have been under 50 percent, of normal Quantities, with the result that farmers,particularly pig and poultry keepers, are having the utmostdifficulty in obtaining essential supplies and some are alreadyslaughtering young animals and breeding stock as the alternative to starvation. of their animals.     We are being pressed to say whether the Government can provide the necessary feeding stuffs and what policy we wish farmers to adopt.3. The short term position is bad enough and will createserious problems in itself, but we now learn that the prospects of amelioration are very uncertain and that the Minister ofShipping has asked the Minister of Food to prepare for areduction of 20 per cent, in his tonnage requirements for all purposes, i.e. from 20 million to 16 million tons for the first year of the war.     We understand that the Ministry of Food desires to avoid any reduction of imports of wheat (amounting to 6 million tons) and to make less than 20 per cent, cuts in sugar and0Useeds and cakes,&apos; with the result that supplies of otherfeeding stuffs, of which maize is by far the most important, would^ave to be reduced by more than 25 per cent.4On the information now available it seems clear that weB^st face at least a 25 per cent, reduction as a whole in the quantities

0f feeding stuffs normally imported.      It is reasonable to assume that farmers will be able to effect some economies in the use of feeding stuffs,&apos; but there is no escaping the fact that at best an appreciable reduction in the numbers of our livestock must becontemplated.5. In these circumstances it is in our view essential thatthe Government should at once take responsibility for determining the order of priority as between the different classes of livestock,having regard to the important national interests involved.      Wehave always contemplated that the maintenance of the milk supply is a primary consi6.ers.tion and that every effort should be madeto provide adequate supplies of feeding stuffs for dairy cows.Pat cattle and sheep are essential to the economy of the farm andwithout them there would be a falling: off of fertility which might reduce much of the value that we expect to secure from the foodproduction campaign.      Horses account for about 12 per cent, of feeding stuff requirements and under conditions of petrol rationing more horses are being used for heavy work, thusincreasing the demand for oats and similar feeding stuffs.      Itseems, therefore,  that it would be difficult to reduce suppliesof feeding stuffs for horses.6. We have,  therefore, to take the necessary measures tosecure that sufficient feeding stuffs are available to maintainthe above mentioned classes of livestock,  and to ensure thatthe deficiency in supplies of food is met at the expense of pigs and poultry, which are heavy users of imported cereals,and the numbers of which must be reduced.      It is understoodthat the Minister of Pood attaches importance to keeping up pig production as far as possible in order to safeguard the baconration.      Provided,, however,  the Ministry of Pood becomes the sole purchaser of fat pigs,  it should be possible to make some reduction in the pig population at the expense of the pork

:j &apos;    223vmarket and for a time secure a larger quantity of bacon from home sources.   Poultry remain the one class of stock which itwould be easiest to reduce in numbers without causingserious interference with essential food supplies, andeverything points to the necessity of reducing feeding stuffsfor poultry keepers hy 50 per cent.    On the generalfarm such action would not lead to insuperable difficulties,   but we must warn our colleagues that there area very large number of specialist poultry keepers, many ofthem in a small way of business, who are mainly dependentupon their poultry as a source of livelihood, and there will inevitably be an outcry from this large and vocal section ofthe agricultural industry.   We must, however, face the factthat at best there must be a substantial reduction in thenumbers of pigs and poultry,7. It is, therefore, necessary, in our view, to institute a system of rationing of feeding stuffs as soon aspossible and to take certain immediate preparatory steps tothat end.    This action will involve the adoption andannouncement of a policy of discrimination between various classes of livestock, deliberately based on the assumptionthat there will he a continuing shortage of supplies of imported feeding stuffs.We recommend that we should be authorised to proceedwith these plans, and in particular -(i) to inform all farmers that there, will be a continuing shortage of imported feedings stuffs and to impress upon them the urgent need for theutmost economy in the use of feeding stuffs, for making the maximum use of home-grown supplies of allkinds, and for increasing their own production of feeding stuffs to the fullest possible extent nextyear.*   We are of course encouraging back-yard poultry and the keeping of cottagers&apos; pigs in order to utilise swill.   We arealso making plans to increase the production of feedingstuffsfor livestock in the harvest of 1940.4.

(ii)  to inform pig producers that they must make their production plans on the assumption that the suppliesof imported feeding stuffs available for theirindustry will be reduced by 20 per cent.      It isnecessary in our view that full control of the saleof pigs should be assumed by the Minister of Pood atthe earliest possible date in order to prevent thesale for pork of pigs which are needed for baconproduction.      In order to meet the present shortterm difficulties a price incentive should be offered for the slaughter of pigs as soon as they reach baconweight.      We should propose to consult with theMinister of Pood on this matter;(iii)  to inform the poultry industry that the quantity of&apos;the principal feeding stuffs required by poultry,namely, wheat, maize, milling offals and oats, mustIn the immediate future be reduced by 50 per cent,and that poultry keepers should,  therefore, plantheir hatching programme accordingly.(Intld.)
