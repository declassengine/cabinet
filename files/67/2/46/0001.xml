Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1939.SECRET.W.P. (GO (39) 95&apos;Copy No.WAR CABINET.Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues remarks prepared in the Admiralty TradeDivision on W.P. (G) (39) 86 by the Ministry of Shipping.w. s. c.Remarks on Paper W.P. (G) (39) 86.  Memorandum by Ministry of Shipping.Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.The implication of the figures contained in Appendices I and II isappreciated by the Admiralty and every endeavour is being made, in consultationwith the Ministry of Shipping, to reduce delays, whatever the cause, and generally to speed up the flow of shipping.2. The convoy system entails a world-wide organisation and it was inevitable that on starting up such a vast machine difficulties would be encounteredand some mistakes made. The Admiralty endeavours to anticipate such thingsor to deal with them as they arise.3. Further, a certain limitation is imposed in the convoy system by thenumber of escorting vessels available;  this position has improved and shouldcontinue to do so.4. It has already been pointed out that the convoy system is not aloneresponsible for the delays.   Such other things as : id) The temporary closing of the Mediterranean,(b) The requisitioning of 2-f million tons of shipping,(c) The bunkering arrangements,(d) The dislocation of shipping generally owing to war conditions,all contributed,improve.Some of these are not recurring, and the position shouldParagraph 5.0-  A paper is now circulating to the Board containing proposals forLa!?ms a daily convoy on the East Coast between the Tyne and-London, instead01 n^ present arrangement of a convoy every other day.&quot; is proposed also to raise the ban on smaller vessels, which proceedcependently, sailing by day.   This was imposed as a protection against theU11&apos;eat of air attack.Wgraph 6.fi        7Oil   i     . ls h0Ped shortly to start two convoys every 8 days from and toaltar, instead of one. This is entirely governed by the availability of escorting120319]ilability
vessels.   It is considered that it would be quite unacceptable to allow shin &quot;to be unescorted on this route in view of the disaster which befell the Yorfcrfr^City of Mandalay, and Clan Chisholm. &apos;&apos; lre&apos;Paragraph 7.7.   Halifax convoy arrangements are under review in consultation with tlMinistry of Shipping.  The desirability of running two slow convoys every 8 da ^instead of a fast and a slow convoy as at present, is being considered. *Paragraph 8.8. Steps have been taken to reduce the time during which vessels on passageare required to zig  zag, and to reduce the deviation and delay on all routes to a minimum consistent with safety.Paragraph 9.9. An additional convoy from Sierra Leone starts on the 18th november in addition, Scandinavian convoys have recently been started and are now runningregularly.Paragraph 10.10. As far as the Admiralty is concerned the defensive equipping ofmerchant ships is expedited as much as possible. It is considered to be vital that all ships should be armed. The question of repairs, &amp;c, is a matter betweenthe Owners and the Ministry of Shipping.Paragraph 12.11. The obscuration of lights is mainly a matter for the Home Office and ministry of Transport. So far as Navigational Lights are concerned, theDirector of Navigation is satisfied that the present system of lighting is quitesufficient for safe navigation. Any requests for increase of lighting aresympathetically dealt with.With regard to restrictions on the entry into ports, Naval Authorities havebeen instructed to reduce them to the minimum consistent with safety.Paragraph 14.12. No diversion from East to AVest Coast ports has in fact been done,except at the request of the Ministry of Food or Supply, since the 23rd October.A paper is at present circulating to the Board, recommending some revisionof the policy for diversion to meet the peculiar conditions of the present war.
