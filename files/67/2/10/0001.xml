The following statement should be included in paragraph 5 : -28th October, 1939.WA R    CABINET.SECRET. COPY HO.___w.P.(&amp;)(59).59 (Annexe).FOOD RATIONING.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.

Trade and Commerce.Mr. Dunwoody (Secretary, Associated Chambers of Commerce ofGreat Britain) consulted Mr. Henry Morgan, Chairman of the London Chamberof Commerce and Mr. Leigh, Secretary to the London Chamber, 9,000 members.Mr. Henry Morgan (Chairman, London Chamber of Commerce and ofTaxation Committee of the Associated Chambers, Accountant, Chairmanof Companies) was strongly of the opinion that there should be a trial period without rationing.     The trial period should be used to see ifnation will ration itself.     The amounts to which people should confine their demands should be made known.     He believed that, having regard tothe inconvenience of rationing, such a procedure would have considerable effect.Mr. Leigh (Secretary of London Chamber of Commerce) was opposed to immediate rationing which might create a bad impression.     The Governmentshould indicate the need of restricted demands and express the hope thatresponse will be such as not to make rationing necessary.     It wouldprobably be necessary to ask retailers what quantities of goods people are ordering in order to know where excessive demands come from.Mr. Howling (Secretary, National Chamber of Trade) thought that onthe whole it would be better for rationing to be imposed.     The country was probably prepared to some extent but the fact that rationing had tobe considered at so early a stage came as a surprise and would of course be criticised in many quarters.     The views of people towards rationingwould probably depend to some extent upon the quantity of each commodityallowed and the quantity suggested would not be regarded as very satisfactory.If rationing were not imposed, there was a great danger of some people thinking that others were getting more  and this was a situation to be avoided if possible.     Failure to ration if there was an actualshortage of these commodities would create difficulties for certainclasses of retailers.     Mr. Howling wished his opinion to be regarded as one stating what he regarded as the lesser of two evils and he did not wish it to be understood that rationing was a good thing unless unavoidable.

Mr. A.V. Alexander (Co-operative Societies) was emphatic in urging the necessity for immediate rationing.     The Co-operative Societies allover the country are experiencing serious shortages of all fourcommodities that of sugax being due to hoarding.     The Societies inLancashire for example are up in arms owing to difficulties in obtaining supplies.     The Stookport Societies have had to ration butter (3-g- oz.)and other Societies have had to act similarly.     He called attention toadvertisements by private traders saying they have plentiful supplies and telling the public &quot;not to despair without first trying them&quot;.     Sofar as such claims are valid, they point to &quot;wangling&quot; of supplies whichmust cause serious trouble.

Free Churches.Rey._Mo.lJI. Aubrey, Moderator, Federal Free Church Council, said that ifthere was any element of risk that su-pplies of any commodity would be short,provided that the case was fully explained to the public, he was sure that those for whom he could speak would attach over-whelming importance to an equitable distribution of such supplies as were available among all sections of thepopulation.Social Contacts.Opinion in King&apos;s Road Public Houses, Chelsea.Everyone seems to expect rationing for meat, bacon and butter and most people for sugar.     No trouble is likely if the ration is reasonable.     Cookingfats should certainly not be rationed.     If they are unrationed 4 ounces of butter will be accepted as most people are expecting 3 ounces, but it isconsidered a poor ration.     Pooling of margarine is thought to be a very great mistake.     Those who can afford to buy margarine at 8d. per pound should beallowed to have it and those who can only afford to pay 4d. will find the pooledprice beyond their means and they will have to go without.     Meat should berationed by value and not by weight.     The Government control of prices was generally approved.Members of Parliament.Mr. Gordon Mac-Donald said that people expect rationing and the shortage ofsupplies in some areas has already got them used to the idea.     They will notcomplain if the rations are fairly generous, say 75 per cent, of normal.Goalminers, being unable to understand need for coal rationing, may suspect other forms of rationing but criticism not expected to be very great.     He would think2/6d. worth of meat a week would be accepted, miners being particularly fond oftheir Sunday joint and any allowance which would not give this to a normal family -would be thought too low.     When asked whether he preferred meat rationing byweight or value he said by weight, but after hearing the other point of view puthe definitely expressed the view that rationing by value was a much better plan,though he thought this point needed explaining very carefully so that the public would see that the poor man was getting a very fair deal.     The butter ration woulpe accepted if cooking fats and margarine were unrationed.     He did not think that; Pooling&quot; was popular anywhere.     People liked to buy the quality and brand ofI

more than their fair share.     He would not risk a shortage of food through lack of caution.     He felt that his view was probably fairly representative ofhis Party.Mr. Graham White believed rationing to be fully expected but thought itshould be as generous as possible.     He was very critical of &quot;pooling&quot; and saidthat pooling of tea, about which he knew something, was particularly stupidand unpopular.     In fact he found difficulty in not expressing himselfover-forcibly on that subject.     He did not have any views on the question of meat rationing by weight or value but vrould think the matter over and make someenquiries in his constituency.     He did not think that butter rationing wouldbe received too unfavourably if margarine and cooking fats were not rationed,but realised it would make a very great cut in the consumption of butter bybetter-off people.Mr. Herbert Williams felt that middle-classes vrould be hit much harder by war than lower classes.     He made the following points:-i.     Rationing will be accepted without a fuss if real necessity is established and it is clearly not imposed merely to gratify the supposed desires of thebureaucracy.     The coal and lighting rations will be cited to show that suchdesires exist as it is alroadjr difficult for merchants in some places to dispose of coal and stocks are being built up and waggons immobilised.2.     It will be said that the Government cannot have needed the many warningsit has received in the past two years, if it finds itself short of food so soon,butt this will be forgiven if the need for rationing now is proved.3.     The waste of effort, paper, etc. involved in rationing is great andannoyance is inevitable and this can only be justified by real necessity.&apos;     Butter,      No serious complaints likely if ration is 4 ounces providedmargarine and cooking fats are unrationed, and public can get margarine it likesand is not forced to buy pooled stuff.I5.    Meat.     This is thought to be the most serious problem.     A good ration in money would be acceptable to middle-classes but a 2/- ration would enable themto get very little of the meat they are used to:    a ration by weight would be/Preferred.     The effect of compelling people to buy inferior meat to get enoughIFill damage the interests of the home producer of good quality beef and benefit the Argentine.     Will any meat be allowed for dogs?

g     Sugar.     A good ration would result in people saying &quot;why ration at all&quot;.7t     &quot;pooling&quot; is objected to mere strongly than rationing itself.      If at thetime rationing is atxnounced pooling is abolished, it would go some way to relieve public anxiety.     Pools force up price to the poor, raise unnecessarilythe cost of living figure and prevent people getting the food they like andare used to, are a nuisance to everyone and appear to serve no useful purpose,e,g. prunes, raisins, tea, etc.Press.Confidential enquiries as to the nature of correspondence addressed to thePress have been made in a fairly wide field throughout Fleet Street, includingthe &quot;Daily Hail&quot; ,    &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Daily Herald&quot;,&quot;Daily Sketch&quot;, and the Allied Newspapers covering Manchester, Sheffield,Glasgow, etc.     On the whole, the significant fact is that in the very large volume of war correspondence received by the Press the numbers of lettersdealing with rationing are comparatively small.      In the case of the &quot;Daily Sketch&apos;for example, which has received about 4,000 letters from the public on questions arising from the war, up to the moment no more than 20 concern the proposedrationing of food.This of itself implies that the question is not one which takes a foremostplace in the public mind.     In one or two cases there are specific suggestions that this is regarded as a further extension of Government control andbureaucracy, but this does not seem to be a very insistent point.      In a few cases people are asking why you should have rationing for articles which eithercannot be purchased or of which the price is rising so rapidly that they cannot afford to buy them.     It seems clear that the public will stand for anything that is reasonable, but in this connection &quot;reasonable&quot; means that the necessityfor the measure has been clearly explained and brought home.     There is aprevalent belief that the butter ration is to be 3 ounces, and it is felt thatthe sooner this is dissipated- the better.     It is important that the fact thatmargarine is not to be rationed should be given great prominence.These enquiries indicate that if rationing is decided upon the sooner thatconstant and accurate news as to the details of the scheme is given, the better.The success or failure at the outset will, to a certain extent, depend upon this.

The enquiries also indicate that there is great confusion in the minds of many people between the rationing and the control of food.     when asked about cheir attitude to rationing they make complaints about the alleged mal-distribution of articles which in no conceivable circumstances would be rationed.     In presenting the rationing scheme it would be well to advertise the distinction between the two things for people who areunable to distinguish for themselves.Scotland.The Rt. Hon. Tom Johnston, M.P. , Regional Commissioner expressedthe following view:-My opinion is that there is persistent and continuous hoarding of sugar.     Some grocers are reported as exceeding normal output by 700$.The factory at Greenock has an output of 50$ over normality.     Persuasionas a remedy is ineffective.     Sugar should be rationed.     Butter might alsobe, especially if any shortage of supply is apprehended, and consideration should be given as to whether margarine should be rationed with it.Bacon should be rationed but care might be taken to give no rationsto babies.Meat is more difficult and ought only to be rationed after the most careful preparation from the farm via the dealer and the slaughterer to thebutcher, and would it not be advisable first to have substantial reserves of deer, rabbits etc. in the cold storage plants now standing half empty.(Intld.)   E.B..27th October, 1959.

APPENDIX.Sugar.In the case of sugar, the quantity placed on the market has been substantially larger than usual, even at this time of the year when thedemands are increased for jam making, etc.     In spite of this, difficulty has been experienced by customers in some districts in obtaining their usualsupplies.     There is some reason to think that private stores are beingaccumulated in many homes.(Suggested ration - 1 lb.).Butter.Supplies are less than normal owing to the reduction in imports fromEuropean sources - but, on the other hand, the output of margarine has been greatly increased.(Suggested ration - 4- oz.).Bacon.Supplies are short for the same reason as butter.     There has not yetbeen time since the outbreak of war to increase imports from Canada and elsewhere to fill the gap caused by the reduction in supplies from Europe.(Suggested ration - 4 oz.).Meat.Home supplies are plentiful, but imported supplies - which are cheaper -have been shorter than usual, partly due to the inevitable delay in organising shipping convoys (this should be less apparent in the future butarrivals will necessarily be less regular than in peace time) and partly because of the increased requirements of the Services both at home and abroad.(Suggested ration - 2/0d.).
