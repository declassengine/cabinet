COPY NO.Ijeeding-Stion.WAR CABINET.ANNOUNCEMENT ON SUPPLY OF FEEDING stuffs and LIVE-STOCK POLICY.Report by a meeting of Ministers(Minister of Food, Secretary ofState for Scotland and theMinisters of Health, Agricultureand Fisheries and Shipping),We were requested by the War Cabinet to submit proposals in regard to imported feeding stuffs and livestock policy (W.M.(39)33 Minute 1, Conclusion 2).1. There is already on acute shortage of imported feeding-stuffs and normal weekly requirements during thewinter season are more than 100,000 tons.     For theremaining weeks to the end of December 1939 nothing we donow can increase imports and the deficiency in the supplyof the main feeding-stuffs for this period is likely to beas follows - rather more than 50% of maize and barley, abort20% of oil-cake and meal, about 30 to 40% of wheat, both home and imported.      This is roughly equivalent to an all*-round deficiency of nearly 50%.2. For the first three months of 1940, it is notpossible to be so precise, but if 880,000 tons of shippingper month is allocated for the import of cereals of allkinds and if two-thirds rf the home crop of wheat goes tothe flour mills, the deficiencies in livestock feeding-stuffs will probably be roughly as follows - 40% maize and barley, 56% oil-cake and meal, 70% wheat, home and imported.The greater deficiency in wheat roughly cancels out thesmaller deficiency expected in other feeding stuffs.  Moreover

(i) the request for 380,000 tons of shipping per month for cereals represents an increase of10^ over the figure previously given to theMinister of Shipping, which he cannot undertaleeto meet;(ii) these months are the period during which it willhe most important to try to make up the deficiency in the stocks of wheat for human consumption, above -the dangerously low level at which they will stand at the end of December.For this reason it will be necessary to taketwo-thirds of the home grown wheat to the flourmills and to use for wheat for human consumpticnany additional shipping that may be available or anything that may be acquired from France.In fact, it is necessary to bring in wheat for human consumption, at the expense of livestockf eeding-st^rCf a,Thuss      allowing &apos;    for the latest estimates of theshipping position^ the supply of imported feeding-stuffsduring the rest of the present winter season will still be only about half of normal requirements,3. It is even more difficult to suggest any precisefigures for later periods.      The general shipping position may indeed improve, but demands for shipping supplies of essential imports are likely to increase also and in thescale of priorities imported feeding-stuffs for livestockcannot rank as high as foodstuffs for human -consumption,, .and munitions, because they can to some extent be replaced by home produced substitutes and because it may always be&apos;more economical of shipping space to import the finished foodproduct.      At best it seems probable that the quantity ofimports will be substantially below normal while the warlasts.      If the position    does      improve later, stocks of pigs and poultry can be relatively quickly built up again and that is one .of the considerations that we have had inmind in considering: th^ question,  dealt with more fullylater in this report, to what forms of livestock therestriction of feeding-stuff;? should in the main beapplied.

4. In the ploughing up campaign that is now proceedingit has been emphasised, both to the County war agricultural Executive Committees, who are responsiblefor local administration, and in propaganda to farmersgenerally, that every effort should be made by farmers to grow more food for their own stock.     Leaflets havealready been published, which have a wide circulation, andothers are in preparation, calling attention toalternative methods of feeding which are calculated toreduce the demand for imported feeding stuffs.     Notes onthe subject and on the use of swill have already been included in the Ministry&apos;s press service.Swill from army camps, aerodromes, hotels and other large institutions is already used for the most parteither by sale to contractors or direct to farmers or inthe case of the- institutions, for feeding to pigs on farmsattached to such institutions.     The possibility of thecollection of waste food stuffs from households presentsmore difficulty but is about to be discussed with the newly established Salvage Department of the Ministry ofSupply.     As regards the rural areas, consideration isbeing given to the encouragement of village pig clubs onthe lines of the scheme in operation in the last war.About a month ago, steps were taken to encourage thecollection.of acorns and beech-nuts by school-children and others and publicity was given to the use of such material for pig feeding.      The response, however, hasbeen disappointing.

USED        5. We considered whether it would he possible to augmentAMDthe available animal feeding-stuffs by a restriction of grainused for brewing beer or distilling whisky.-.    At present theCerdals. Control Board have ceased to allocate any importedmaize, or barley for brewing     but brewers are buying home-grown barley rapidly at high pricesc,    On the -assumption thatthe bulk of beer brewed must be maintained it is not possibleto effect economies in the quantity of barley and maiseused by brewers without reducing the gravity which,  if therevenue is not to suffer, in turn involves raising the duty,,This involves technical and financial questions as well asquestions of policy.    A reduction of 20% in cereals usedin breweries would give a net saving of about 100,000 tonsin the full year.6e In so far as whisky is concerned, no imported barleyor maize is being delivered to the distillers.    If thispolicy is carried on, we understand that some of thedistilleries engaged in the production of grain whisky willhave to close down at an early date, though those producingmalt whisky will bo able to continue for the present on theirexisting stocks of barley, and the home crop0    The President ofthe Board of Trade views this possibility with concern in view ofits repercussions on the export tra-lt^  In particular to the UnitedStates, which might have important bearings on the dollarexchange position in three or four years time.    It was our general feeling, however;, that it would be extremely difficultto justify a diversion of feeding-stuffss urgently required at this crisis?for building up stocks of whisky, of whichthere was already several years supply in hand, and that therefore In spite of the possibility that unemployment might

be caused by the closure of distilleries the policy of   318not allocating grain for this purpose should be oantinuod.7. If distilling were stopped forthwith and the purchases of this seasons barley and maize already effectedi were requisitioned,  the net saving after talcing other factorssuch as the reduced feeding value of the distillers1 grainsinto account would be about 200,000 tons, i.e. two weeksnormal imports of these cereals.    This, with the savin;; tobe expected from a 30^ reduction in consumption of cerealsby breweries-,would amount to about 3 weeks normal imports. InView of the technical and financial questions involved, wehave arranged for a committee of officials of the departmentsconcerned to consider forthwith the results of a  )olic3r of cutting off supplies for distilleries and breweries, and todeal in particular with the distillery problem as one of immediate urgency.    But these economies, even if found tobe practicable would not materially affect the general position and the general statement of policy to which we wishto draw attention by an immediate announcement.LOCATION     8, We also considered how any restriction of importedISELECTIONS feeding stuffs should be allocated between the various formsof live stock production.    We agree, subject to a reservation by the Minister of Health, that it is desirablethat no reduction should be contemplated in the allocationosf feeding stuffs for dairy cows and fat stock, though under war conditions the extra finish required to produce theJaighest quality meat   is not desirable. This canbe secured by adjusting the price in such a way as to makehighest quality meat unprofitable to produce.     The restriction in feeding stuffs should, in our view, mainly beapplied to fo-2.din.er stnffs for pigs and poultry.    Not only

are their numbers considerably in excess of those during thelast war but they are more easily and rapidly replaced.      we accept the advice of the Minister of Agriculture and theSecretary of State for Scotland that the proportionate reductionin feeding stuffs for pigs and poultry should be at least 30 and50 per cent, respectivelyg though it may be necessary to revisethese figures If, as appears possible at the moment, some further reduction may be necessary.9. The dinisto^ of Healtl r-onresc.nt:j that a given amountof feeding stuffs fed to the hen will produce twice as much fleshforming food as the same amount fed to the pig,  and that the foodfed to the latter is to a very great extent formed into fat whichis not so essential in view of the very large stocks of margarineoil now in this country.      Furthermore, his view is that it iseasier to import extra bacon than extra eggsf&quot;       He would,therefore, prefer to see more emphasis laid on the need for economy in the use of feeding stuffs for fat. stock and as betweenpigs and poultry he would prefer that poultry should be more favourably treated.^        10.        &quot;We attach the draft of an announcement to he made byBY      the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the SecretaryISTSHAGRIOUIfOf State for Scotland, which has been framed with a view to2 AMDRETARY presenting the situation in as encouraging a light as possible.STATE&amp; We wish to call attention to two points.      first the issue of any announcement that there is going to be aconsiderable shortage of feeding stuffs,  the burden of whichis to fall in the main on pig and poultry farmers, will inevitably give rise to the question of the action that the(L       x   Bacon occupies 65 cubic feet per ton,  eggs 108 ::ubic feetper ton.

Government proposes to take to secure allocation of theavailable supplies among different classes of livestock.The Agricultural Ministers had proposed that a reference tothe necessity for the rationing of feeding stuffs should heincluded in the draft announcement , but other members of theCommittee felt that this question required further examination -which we understand is already proceeding before theGovernment could he committed to such a policy.     We are convinced, however, that the question of rationing feedingstuffs will have to he considered as one of great urgency,Farther, in the view of the Agricultural Ministers, it would beimpossible to secure restriction of feeding stuffs to particular classes of stock without a system of rationing.11,     Secondly, as indicated above,  the Minister of Healthis in disagreement with the third paragraph of the statementdealing with the proportionate reductions of feeding stuffsfor pigs and poultry, and has pointed out that dietary surveysshow that eggs form part of the normal weekly consumption of even the poorest families.      The general view of the Committeeis, however, that in view of the position occupied by bacon inthe ordinary diet of -the country     the heavier out might hewell imposed on the poultry farming industry.     Moreover,, it.J.a intended to ration bacon shortly.12,     We ask authority (l) for the annexed statement to beissued forthwith hy the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland, subject to a decisionon the two points mentioned in, paragraph 10;(2) for the enquiry into the possibility of a system of rationing livestock feeding-stuffs to he carried forward asIllicitly as possible with a view to the submission of proposals on this point;    (3) for the enquiry by an interdepartmental committee at the official level which we have instituted intothe effects of restriction on the supply of grains used forhalting beer or distilling whiskey;    (4) for the continuance inthe meantime of the policy under which no imported grain isbeing released for breweries or distilleries.

ANNEX,,DRAFT ANNOUNCEMENT.FEEDING STUFFS AND LIVESTOCK POLICY.The Government have had under consideration theexisting and prospective position with regard to supplies of imported feeding stuffs for animals,    The readjustment ofshipping programmes to suit war-time conditions, and theheavy demands for cargo space for munitions and other essential war materials have necessarily involved some considerable reduction in the large quantities of feeding stuffs - particularlybarley and maize - which are normally brought into this country from overseaso    It must be anticipated that these factors willcontinue to operate in some degreeD    It is necessary therefore to ensure that the supplies of imported feeding stuffs likelyto be available are utilised to the best national advantage.The maintenance of the milk supply is a matter of primary importance and,  in consequence, every effort will bemade to provide adequate supplies of feeding stuffs for dairycows.   Fat cattle and sheep are most valuable to the   economy of the farm and any reduction in their numbers would resultin a diminution of the fertility of the soil which wouldhave serious repercussions on the food production campaignas a whole0    Furthermore, these classes of stock constitute areserve of meat which once depleted cannot be speedilyrestored.    It is, therefore, highly desirable to ensure thatsuch animals are properly fed,  taking account of any economiesthat can be effected through the better utilisation ofpastures, green fodder, roots and other home grown crops.The supply situation with regard to oil cakes and meals,which constitute the chief form of concentrate for winterfattening, is more favourable thar in the case of cereal

products., and while under war conditions the extra finishrequired to produce the highest quality meat is not desired,there should he sufficient supplies available to bring the animals into good beef condition and to render it unnecessaryfor farmers to market their stock prematurely through fear that the necessary feeding stuffs may not be forthcoming.In these circumstances the necessary economiesmust be secured in the main by a reduction in the suppliesof feeding stuffs available for the pigs and poultryindustries, which a re particularly heavy users of importedgrain and cereal products.    Pig and poultry producers are accordingly advised to plan their production programmes forthe next twelve months on the basis that the supplies of imported feeding stuffs available for their use will bereduced by at least SO aiDd 50 per cent,  respectively below normal pre-war quantities.It does not by any means follow that the pig and poultry populations need be reduced in these proportions.In war-time we have to recast our ideas about many things.Scientifically excellent methods of feeding pigs on aperfectly balanced ration of the finest quality barley mealand other components imported from abroad may pay inpeace-time but they have to go in war-time.    The pig is anomnivorous animal and there is really no, need to Importlarge quantities of barley and maize meal when pigs willthrive on foods usually wasted, such as chat potatoes, housesoraps and garden refuse for the fattening pig, and acornsand beechmast for the breeding pig, which can range thewoods as the wild pig did in the past.The pig made a remarkable contribution to victory in the last world war.    Then with many fewer pigs than wehave now in the United Kingdom (2,860,000 against 4,390,000)

village pig clubs were formed all over the country andcottagers and others were encouraged to keep pigs in thomost economical way possible.    These pigs, kept in onesand twos at the bottom of the garden, made a great contributionto the nation&apos;s stgply   of pig meat and also gave nig breedersa ready market for young store pigs.    So again in this warthe output of pork and bacon can be maintained with lessrecourse to imported feeding stuffs.Poultry farming has also grown on specialisedlines and presents special problems in war-time   but thisspecialisation has not proved an unmixed blessing.    Undermodem practice the hen is often confined to a lastingbattery and fed largely on imported grain and mash.    divorced from the land specialist poultry keeping expanded too rapidly and the industry was overcome by disease.    With common-sensethe hen can be fitted into the scheme of war-time foodproduction, and the general farms, which carry the majorityof the country&apos;s hens, will be able to improvise rations to supplement what the hens can find for themselves.Fortunately from the standpoint of egg supplieswe- start this war with 69,000,000 hens compared with38,000,000 at the beginning of the last war.    So with hens,as well as pigs, the United Kin-dom has a full stock to seeher through the self-denying ordinance which will be the rule from now onwards.The denial to pigs and poultry of the luxury ofa full ration of barley moal. and maize will release moreshipping for the transport of aeroplanes and armaments acrossthe Atlantic.    No less important from the nation&apos;s stand-point in war-time it will enable the fullest possible use to be made of all available feeding materials by concentratingPig and poultry production on the general farm, in the cottagegarden and the suburban backyard.
