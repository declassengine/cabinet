copy no.       /3sap CABINET,BACTERIOLOGICAL &quot;7ARPARE.(Previous Paper No/:.. P. (Gj (39) 111)Note &quot;by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence,The Notes by the Medical Research Council circulated bythe Lord President suggest to my mind that the ,7ar cabinet might be interested to know the preparations for defence againstbacteriological warfare which Were made by the Committee ofImperial Defence on the recommendations of Lord (then SirMaurice) Hanlcey&apos;s Sub-Committee.      These are set out in theattached Summary and show the position as it was on the outbreakof the war.2. It will be noted that the measures described in the summary deal solely with the defensive aspect of this subject,consideration of the offensive uses of bacteriological warfarehaving been strictly ignored.      This was in conformity withthe declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as a signatoryof the Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibiting the use ofasphyxiating or poisonous or other gases, and of bacteriologicalmethods of warfare as confirmed in the Joint Anglo-FrenchDeclaration of the 3rd September, 1939 as follows&quot;Finally,  the two Allied Governments reaffirm their intention to abide by the terms of the Geneva&quot;Protocol of 1925 prohibiting the use in war ofasphyxiating or poisonous or other gases andbacteriological methods of warfare.      An enquirywill be addressed to the German Government as towhether they are prepared to give an assurance to the same effect.&quot;

result of correspondence which passed, between Lord Hankey and myself during September last, it was decided, with theapproval of the Prime Minister, that the Medical research council should carry out experimental work into thepossibilities of transmitting infection to man by various formsof micro-organisms through the air, with a view to giving usgreater knowledge as to how to protect ourselves against suchmethods.      It was made clear that these researches should be conducted in this spirit and not with the object of resorting to such methods ourselves, and that on no account should fieldexperiments on a large scale be undertaken without a furtherdecision.L. In common with a number of other C.I.D. committees which were transferred to Departments on the outbreak of war,the Sub-Committee on Emergency Public Health Laboratory Services(the body responsible for investigations in connexion withbacteriological warfare) was placed under the aegis of theMinistry of Health, &quot;to be assembled as required&quot; by that ministry and the Department of Health for Scotland.&quot;     i suggest that it is for consideration whether, in view of thequestions of policy which are involved in this subject, theCommittee should not be reconstituted as a Committee of theWar Cabinet with such readjustment of its composition as maybe thought necessary to meet the requirements of actualwarfare.Richmond Terrace,21st November, 1939.36   -\P.(G)(39) 17, page h.(Initialled) C.

SUMMARY OP PREPARATIONS MADE FOR protection against BACTERIOLOGICAL WARFARE AND THEBACTERIOLOGICAL EFFECTS&quot;OF AIR WARFARE PIT THISCOUNTRY UP TO THE OUTBREAK OF WAR.Origin of Enquiry.1.On the 2nd November&apos;9 I93G a Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence was set up under theChairmanship of Lord (then Sir Maurice) Hankey to reporton the practicability of the introduction ofbacteriological warfare and to make recommendations as.to the counter-measures which could be taken to dealwith that eventuality.      The Subcommittee held numerousmeetings during the period 1936-58 and submitted threeReports (C.I.D. Papers Eos.  1315-B, 1424-B and 1438-B).Basis of JSnonijrjre2. Great Britain being a party to  the geneva protocol of 1925 prohibiting the use of asphyxiatingor poisonous or other gases, and of bacteriologicalmethods of .warfare5 the Sub-Committee confined itsinvestigations strictly to considerations of defence,,Gene ra2 C onclusipns.3. The general&quot;conclusions of the Sub-Committee maybe summarised as followss-(a) It wasthat the dropping of bacteria fromregarded as improbableaircrafteither in any form of bombs or by spraying in dry orliouid formwould be as effective

a method of attack on the civilian populationas the use of high explosives * gas5 orincendiary bombs.     It was, however,recognised that the enemy might attempt tointroduce bacteria by aircraft in the hopeof the psychological effect which thiswould produce.      If sos it was to beexpected that a certain number of serious,and in some cases, fatals infections mightbe caused in this ways but it was not considered that the number would be verygreat.ogical (b)    It was considered that much more serious effects might be produced by the dissemination of bacteria by enemy agents9because it would be possible in this wayto infect water3 milk and other foodstuffs,and thus to start epidemics of a kind whichmight spread widely beyond the originalfocus of infection.psychological  (c)   Apart altogether from the deliberatees ofand dissemination of bacteria either by aircraft or by saboteurs,  the Sub-Co mini t teewere strongly of the opinion that a more urgent and serious problem was to be foundin the spread of disease in this countryresulting from conditions inherent in modern warfare.     Large-scale evacuationinto areas with relatively ill-developedsanitary services would alone increase the

ection ofals.likelihood, of such epidemics,  and anyextensive air attacks, such as might cause a serious dislocation of the sanitaryservices in urban areas, would aggravate the danger.      Skilful bacteriological sabotageadded to these unfavourable conditionsmight lead to very considerable outbreaks,especially of intestinal infections, suchas dysentery and typhoid.(d)    In regard to livestock, as distinct fromthe human beings, it was considered thatthe dissemination of bacteria or virusesby aircraft might be much more effective,particularly in the case of foot-and-mouth disease and also of anthrax.ction ofs.(e)    The introduction of plant pests anddiseases by the enemy was not regarded asa very serious danger    no pest being knownwhich would cause great harm to any of the major crops within a reasonably short period from its introduction.      Coloradobeetle, which attacks potato crops, wouldbe the most difficult pest to deal with.,but it was considered that an   epidemiccould be kept under control withoutgreat difficulty.

iOlCounter-Measures,to deal v/ith possible epidemics of disease inhuman-beings and animalss and pests in cropss resultingeither -(i) from deliberate attempts on the part ofthe enemy to introduce them by aircraft or soboteurSj or(ii) from the conditions inherent in airwarfare3 including evacuation and apossible breakdown of sanitary services9are as follows:-replies of (a) An attempt was made to assess theceings andi. probabilities in regard to those infectivediseases that would be most likely to cause serious epidemicsP and supplies of certainpreventive vaccines and curative serasvarying in quantity according to theestimated degree of possible infection3were obtaineds distributed and stored.(These supplies were additional to theprovision of antitoxins for the protectionof wounded persons against the ordinaryrisks of infection with tetanus and gas-gangrene:    in this regard2 it may be mentioned that 19400,000 doses of tetanusantitoxin were provided to meet theestimated initial requirements of the civilpopulation and the mobilisationrequirements of the Defence Services),

(b) The possibility of widespread epidemicsresulting from war conditions,irrespective of deliberate attempts atbacteriological warfare, drew attentionto the lack of adequate provision oflaboratory facilities for the rapiddiagnosis of infectious diseases,particularly in those rural areas whichwould receive persons evacuated from thelarger cities and towns.    arrangements were therefore made to provide anEmergency Public Health Laboratory Service,under the direction of the Medical research council, which would provide the requisiteadditional facilities throughout Englandand Wales (see CI,D. Paper No. 1438-B).The general function which this Service-will perform is the rapid diagnosis ofoutbreaks of infective desease and thedistribution of vaccines and sera to preventtheir spread.    It comprises 35 emergencylaboratories, all of which are fully equipped and staffed (see attached Ministryof Health Circular dated the 5th September,1939)*.    This Service was successfullymobilised at the beginning of the war and isnow in operation.    A similar Service hasbeen organised by the Department of health for Scotland.

cn^vHnTis against   (c) The danger of hacteriological sahotage by enemy agents has &quot;been brought to the noticeof the Security Service on various occasions.The most effective defence against, this danger is to be found less in providingagainst the particular possibilities of whatenemy agents might do, than by interningsuch aliens and other suspicious charactersas might be capable of sabotage.      Internmentof such individuals was carried out duringthe Precautionary Stage prior to the outbreakof war.     As ,a further precaution, the security service were supplied with a memorandum prepared by the Medical Research Council,setting out the kind of behaviour and action by saboteurs for which they should be on thelook-out to      Arrangements have also been made whereby containers found in suspiciouscircumstances, or foodstuffs falling undersuspicion shall be sent to a central laboratoryfor immediate examination by expertbacteriologists.ction of (d) The precautions taken by the Ministry of stock.Agriculture and Fisheries in regard to livestockfall under two main headings(i)    Foot and Mouth Disease0After careful consideration of the steps which should be taken to cope withsudden and extensive outbreaks of footand mouth disease in cattle under v/arconditions,  the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries, and the Scottish Office,came to the conclusion that the normalpeacetime organisation for dealing withthis disease would be adequate, and theprocedure, viz0 , slaughter and therestriction of movement of animals,suitable.     Furthermore, they examined,

in collaboration with the Food(Defence Piano)Department, the modifications of policy and procedure which migiit he necessary should the disease become so widespread as toproduce a marked decrease in meat and milk supplies, and were of theopinion that such modification as mightbe called for would depend on theextent of the outbreak and would haveto be a matter for decision at thetime0Recently discovered methods ofvaccination are being tested at the foot and Mouth Disease Research station at Pirbright with the object of determining the most effective and suitable so that in the event of the disease becoming uncontrollable by methods of slaughter facilities atthe station may be devoted exclusively to the production of vaccine.In addition, ^arrangements are under consideration for thepreparation and use of serum (the source being the recovered animalsin natural outbreaks)  as an additionalweapon in the event of the output ofvaccine being inadequate to deal withthe emergency,,(ii) Anthrax;,As mentioned in paragraph 3 (d)above, the infection of livestock withanthrax by means of the dissemination of bacteria from aircraft is considered a practicable xiiethod of attack, andsuch attacks, if carried out, might cause serious losses to stock0      As a precaution against this danger theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheriesnow have at their disposal 2 milliondoses of anti-anthrax vaccine, and canfurnish unlimited additional quantitiesat a fortnights notice0     For curativepurposes, a stock of 100,000 doses ofserum has been obtained, and 75animals are now producing further supplies of serum at the rate of25,000 doses a month0      The majorityof this serum and vaccine is distributed at various DivisionalCentres throughout the country, theremainder being kept in the form of &apos;a&apos;reserve store at &quot;/eybridge-(e) Protection against the deliberateinfection of crops is to be found mainly in the provision of raw materials forthe manufacture of insecticides and

fungicides, and to a lesser degree, ofspraying equipment.     Steps have &quot;been,taken by the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries to ensure the necessary supply ofraw materials for the first year of war overa range extending from 1 ton of mercury to10,500 tons of sulphur.     The supply of thenecessary spraying equipment is covered bycontract.

MINISTRY OF HEALTH,Whitehall, S. W. 1,5th September, 1939.Dear Sir,EMERGENCY PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY SERVICE.An Emergency Laboratory Service has been organised by theMedical Research Council, in consultation with the Ministry ofHealth, to augment the existing facilities for bacteriologicaldiagnostic work required for public health purposes, . . It isantioipated that the demand for such work may be considerably increased in some parts of the country under war conditions, andalso that many of the usual arrangements may cease to be efTec-tive.      It is not intended, however, that the scheme shouldinterfere in any way with the operation of normal services where these can be maintained.A list of the Emergency Laboratories is given belowe    Theassistance which thay can give will, for appropriate purposes,be freely at the disposal of the Medical Officers of Health -and the medical services generally, both civil and military -within convenient reach of the respective situations.      Thegeneral function which this Service will perform is the rapiddiagnosis of outbreaks of infective disease and the distributionof vaccines and sera to prevent their spread.      It is not proposed that the Emergency Service should undertake pathologicalwork of other kinds, such as that done in ordinary hospitallaboratories.The pathological laboratories of the Ministry of Healthhave   been amalgamated for the time being with the EmergencyService..     Its staff and functions have been transferred from london to the central laboratories of the Emergency Service atOxford and Cambridge.The ten Emergency Public Health Laboratories in the Greater\

London area are attached to the several Hospital Sectors.Elsewhere in England and Wales they are directly administered by the Medical Research Council.     A similar scheme is directed hy the Department of Health for Scotland..Yours faithfully,(Signed)     ARTHUR S. MACNALTYoChief Medical Officer.The Medical Officer of Health.
