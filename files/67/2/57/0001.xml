106. COPY NO.     /JWAR CABINET.INTERVIEW WITH M. DALADIER.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY.Memorandum of an interview withM.Daladier on Monday,  13th november in a private room at the Hotel Ritzin Paris, on the occasion of a lunchgiven by the French Minister ofMunitions.There were present:-M. Daladier,M. Campinchi,M. Guy La Chambre,H.E. The British Ambassador,M. Dautry,and myself............M. Daladier was rather scornful of people who insist upon war aims.     He much approved the statement of lord halifax, that once you are in a war,  the first thing to do is towin it.      He said he was convinced, that Britain and france were withstanding the greatest attack that had ever been made.He deplored pacifism in the Universities,, and described it asa fundamental failure to read history or understand Germanmethods.He spoke scornfully of Belgium and Holland in theirattitude.      He said both were becoming very difficult in reg-ardto staff talks just in the measure in which the immediate dangerof actual invasion temporarily receded.      He felt both countries

might he gingered, up if they realised the threat to the Congo onthe one hand, and the Dutch East Indies on the other.     Ke was entirely against offering them military support and was inclined to suggest that Great Britain and France would work out their own-plans, merely regretting that Belgium had not seen her way toallow physical intervention sufficiently early.ivl. Daladier was sceptical of any &quot;quiet&quot; on the partof the Germans, whether at the Front or in diplomacy.      Kerecalled Verdun, which was a notoriously quiet sector, and yet the scene of the great mass attack in February 1916.M. Daladier had visited the French Front the previous day; and tola, a number of anecdotes of aviators., ta.nl: drivers,officers, non-commissioned officers and men.      He was immenselystruck with the morale of the whole of the troops whom he had visited.      He spoke with emotion of the effectiveness of the collaboration &quot;between Great Britain and France, and of thenecessity for both countries to exhibit what he called &quot;teamspirit51.He suggested, we should he prepared for anything, althoughweather conditions were likely to damp down either air attack orlarge-scale military operations much before the end of March next.He thought it was time to sit down to the programme of 194&apos;.:., ashe felt it was rather late to alter any programme for 1940.He has no illusions about a short or a quick war.      he spoke very hopefully of France&apos;s food situation.      He hoped thatin the realm of supply of munitions and chemicals the twocountries would supply each other&apos;s deficiencies, and in answer to a direct question from myself, he said that of two alternatives,be would rather have more immediate help at the risk of lesseventual help,  than more help in 1941 at the expense of &quot;1940.He was extremely cordial, seemed in very good form;.   itis evident that he and M. Dautry are on excellent terms.(Initialled)    E.L.B.is1*y of Supply,15th November,   1939.- o-
