IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.COPY no war      CABINETDRAFT SWEDISH WAR TRADE AGREEMENTSummary of ProposalsMemorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare

Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare1.    As the result of long negotiations, agreement hasbeen reached with the Swedish Mission on the draft of a war trade Agreement with Sweden which would have the effect of restricting Germany&apos;s imports and preventing German transittrade via Sweden in overseas imports, while permitting sweden to continue her trade with us and with most of her neutralcustomers and to obtain her usual imports.2.    The main provisions of the agreement which is con-templated for the achievement of these objects are as follows:(a) A list is being drawn up of commodities derived bySweden from overseas sources.(b) The Government of the United Kingdom are to agree thatno obstacle shall he placed in the way of the import bySweden of reasonable quantities of these commodities.(c) In return for this Sweden is to prohibit entirely allexport of these commodities whether as raw materials orderivatives therefrom or waste thereof or in manufacturedor semi-manufactured form, except:-(:&apos;.) for certain agreed inter-Scandinavian trade;(ii) for very small quantities thereof normally includedin Swedish manufactures;   (This exception is verystrictly regulated by the wording of the agreement),(iii) for normal trade exports to neutral destinationsapproved by us,(d) All other commodities are to he dealt with on the basisof &quot;normal trade&quot;,  and for this purpose the figures of quantities contained in the Swedish trade statisticsfor the year 1938 are to be treated as standard.    Theapplication of the &quot;normal trade&quot; principle has thefollowing effect:-(i) No/

(i) No obstacle to be placed in the way of the importby Sweden of the normal trade commodities up to thelevel in force in the year 1938.    In general, these imports are derived from sources outside our control which explains why they are not included in the restricted list,(ii) Sweden1s export of normal trade commodities to becontinued to both belligerents but only up to thelevel of the 1938 figures, provided that if bothbelligerents desire to exceed their 1938 figuresthey may do so so long as the sales to each belli-gerent represent the same proportion of the totaltrade of both belligerents in the commodity concerned as was the case in the year 1938.(The year 1938 was selected largely because Swedishsales to Germany were rather less than usual, while those to the United Kingdom were rather more than usual) ,(iii)  It is understood that the normal trade principle wouldnot countenance the commencement of sales to abelligerent of articles which have never been sold to that belligerent by Sweden in the year 1938.Further,  Sweden is to be entitled to import quantitiesof a particular raw material from one of the bellige-rents for the purpose of converting the same into afinished product in Sweden for re-export to suchbelligerent.      It is thought that both these pro-visions will operate in our favour,  and, by virtueof the latter,  agreement has already been reached with the Swedes to permit them to import certain oresin quantities in excess of their domestic requirementsprovided that they sell certain resulting Ferro-alloysnecessary/

necessary for our armaments- industry to the Alliesand prohihit all sales thereof to Germany..(e) An Anglo-Swedish Standing Commission is to he set up and maintained during the life of the agreement to watchSwedish trade tendencies and to ensure that such tradeis regulated in the manner provided for in the agreement.The Commission is to he supplied v/ith full monthlystatistics of Sweden&apos;s import and export trade and facilities will he given to check figures and to ascer-tain the extent of the stocks of commodities held in sweden.(f) The agreement expresses the intention of the parties topromote trade between themselves,  and every effort is tohe made through the Standing Commission to facilitate the flow of goods between the two countries and to over-come wartime obstacles.      In particular, it is intendedto aholish declarations as to ultimate destination ofgoods exported to Sweden and to rely upon the operationof the Swedish system of export licences as regulated hythe agreement under the supervision of the standing commission.      This will greatly facilitate the granting of licences for the export to Sweden of United kingdom goods.      Further, Certificates of Origin are to heabolished in the case of goods exported from Sweden tothe United Kingdom which are in fact of Swedish origin,while the Navicert system (when in operation) will hewidely used to assist the passage of Swedish importsfrom overseas sources through our Contrahand control system,3.    It is necessary to emphasise that an agreement on theforegoing lines involves the permission for Sweden to importon/

on a normal trade basis all articles not on the restricted listeven though she is entitled to continue normal trade withGermany in such articles or derivatives therefrom.      Most of thearticles on the British contrahand list are included in the listof Swedish restricted commodities, hut there are some exceptions,due to the fact that Sweden can obtain her imports of certain commodities from sources (e.g. Russia) outside our control.This feature cannot he avoided if a freely negotiated agreement is to he made with the Swedes.h.      There is also the question of Swedish trade withNeutrals in articles on the normal trade list.      There is no restriction upon such trade, and the Swedes argue that we mustcontrol the ultimate destination of such goods so far as we require to do so in our War Trade arrangements with the neutral countries concerned.      We shall have particulars of all suchtrade in the monthly statistics to he supplied to us, and itis felt that the Swedish Government cannot act as our policemenin requiring their traders to enter into any arrangements withtheir neutral customers for prohihiting the re-export of Swedishgoods.5.      Provision is made that the Agreement may after threemonths be denounced hy either party on a month&apos;s notice.6.      The proposed arrangements would take the form of a shortProtocol (attached as Appendix 1) in quite general terms,  setting out the mutual assurances given hy each country as to its trade policy and providing for the constitution of the Joint standing commission.     This Protocol would he accompanied hy a declaration by each Government (attached as Appendices 2 and 3) givingmore detailed assurances as to the application of the principles laid down in the Protocol.      Finally, there would be an agreed.document/

31st October,  1939- (initialled) R.H.C.\document (still being drafted) setting out the instructions forthe Joint Standing Commission.      The Swedish Delegation would prefer that none of these documents should be published andthat only an agreed communique should be issued.      I am inclined to agree to this course:    in any case the Instructionsto the Joint Standing Commission should evidently be a con-fidential document.7.    Approval is sought for the conclusion of an agreement on these lines.      If the Cabinet is prepared to authorise its acceptance on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  I will take steps to obtain the concurrence of the &quot;French Government whom we have promised to consult before concluding any Agreement.
