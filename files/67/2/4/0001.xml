(This Document isProperty of His Britannic majesty&apos;s government)secret.P.(G)(39) 54.Copy no war cabinet india AND THE war memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.In continuation of paper W.P.(G)(39) 53, Icirculate for the information of the War Cabinet afurther telegram just received from the Viceroy.INDIA OFFICE.Z.24th October 1939.Telegram from Viceroy dated 24th October 1939.2385-private and personal.   Your private andJy personal telegram 793, 23rd October.    The fact that Hoaretended. .   -himself with his long association with this work, shouldbe putting our case, which I am sure he will do with theutmost skill, will lend great weight to its presentation.I will let you have the appreciation you want onWednesday, and will also telegraph further aboutconsultative committee.   Certain further points likelyto be of value in the debate may occur to me by then,and if so I will telegraph them.2. I have considered very carefully the suggestion in paragraph 1 of your telegram; but in the light of

oclose examination of it i think, despite its immediateattractiveness, that it would be unwise to adopt it.   as you will remember I was myself anxious in August (my telegram 1693-s, 25th August and connected correspondence)to give right at the beginning of the war some indication that while we could not enter into any commitments as towhat would happen at the end of the war, past historyshowed that His Majesty&apos;s Government had never beenunmindful of co-operation, etc.; but that suggestion you were unable to accept.   Thereafter it was agreed, andannouncement made by me in the Assembly, that because ofthe war we must suspend the federal scheme, the argumentbeing that we could not go forward with it when ourenergies were inevitably directed elsewhere.   The next stage of any indication of our aims is represented by my statement as approved by the Cabinet; but that again didnot go anything like as far as the present suggestion would take us.    I think we must be careful to avoidanything at this early stage inconsistent with ourpostponement of federal work because of war pressure; andi am particularly anxious, too, to avoid any appearance of gradual concessions, or any idea that we are givingway bit by bit.3.        Apart from that, I should anticipate myself thata suggestion such as the present,  if made, would be countered by immediate demand for action at once; byemphasis on uncertainty as to the period of duration ofthe war; and by a refusal to accept anything of this order merely as a reward for good behaviour in provincialMinistries over an undefined period; and that the strongest pressure would be brought upon us (probablywith support from the Opposition at home) to start a

- 3 -Round Table Conference at once.    I quite agree that weshall be unlikely in any event to get through the warwithout having to take some more active step; and it was with that idea in view that i was anxious to keep until alater stage if possible re-constitution of Centre on broadlines suggested by Zafrullah Khan.   But I am sure that weshould get no distance merely on the suggestion now that discussions might take place before the end of the warrather than after its conclusion.    i do not think the analogy of the Great War is a valid one.   Apart from thefact that we waited for three years before committing ourselves, we were pretty clear as to where we stood inrelation to the ultimate outcome of the war before we did .so.    I do not in these circumstances really think thatthe adoption of this suggestion would ease matters.4.        i have, as you may well imagine, been pondering thewhole position with great care in the light of my ownheavy responsibility.   The Moslem League, the Liberals,and Congress have now of course all taken position, and youwill have seen their manifestoes.    The Moslem League&quot;s,despite the qualifications included in it, makes it clear at any rate that a very substantial body of opinion isprepared to co-operate with us and distinctly emphasisesagain that the differences which stand in the way of progress are not of our making, but are due to feeling between the two communities.   Nevertheless i think weshould be unwise necessarily to assume that the presentMoslem attitude will long persist.   Their platform is essentially anti-nationai and anti-democratic, and i feel sure their younger leaders will soon grow restive about apolicy so utterly sterile.    i therefore do not regardMoslem support as something upon which, by itself, we can safely afford to build any long term policy.    It would be

- 4 -43much easier to deal with the position that confronts ushad the Congress claims not been pitched so high,   in considering any possible bridge or compromise one has atthe moment to give full weight to the risk that it may bemet by a reiteration of the demand for a guarantee of freedom or independence either at the end of the war orimmediately such as we cannot, as I see if, give.5. That danger is a serious obstacle to progress; butI have, I need not say, considered all possible alternatives to a complete break with Congress andresignations of ministries, the arguments for and against which are familiar to us and need not be repeated here.For the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 to 3 I do not regard the suggestion in your telegram 793 as a hopefulline of advance.   The Course which seems to me to offer    &apos;the best prospect of our regaining the initiative inconstructive policy is that, once the Commons debate is over, I should send for Jinnan with Sikander, and Gandhiwith Rajendra Prasad; and point out to the four of themthat these two resolutions passed by their constituentsnow stand side by side; and that they constitute as they stand a full justification of my refusal to disregardminorities and their claims, and of my emphasis on theessential necessity of agreement between parties and interests as a condition of progress.    I might go on tosay that it seemed to me that in these circumstances all three of us - Congress, Moslems, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment - ran some risk of embarking on a sterilephase which would not be to advantage hereafter and whichcculd only result in leaving them, so far asconstitutional progress was concerned at the end of thewar probably very much at the point which they had now reached; that before His Majesty&apos;s Government made op

their minds to accept such a position I felt hound to ask my visitors whether they would not try among themselvesto come to some working arrangement in respect of theprovincial field; with a view, having achieved, a workingbasis between themselves in respect of the provinces, toenabling them to give me an indication of what they wouldtogether regard ss a reasonable scheme for the Centre inrespect of the war period, in which event I should beprepared on behalf of, and in consultation with, HisMajesty&apos;s Government to examine any such proposals in themost helpful and constructive spirit.6.   .    Having put it to them in this way, if in fact theywere able to come to some arrangement about the provinces and could put up a workable scheme for the Centre, Iwould endeavour to bring that scheme within the generalambit of Zafruilah Khan&apos;s plan, in particular avoiding aCongress majority, though I think one might very well have to go one further than Zafruilah Khan and contemplate the Defence Portfolio being held by an Indian (notnecessarily a member of Congress or the Moslem League -I am thinking of Zafruilah Khan himself as a good choice).7. I am very conscious of the risks involved, though suspect that they might prove to be more formidable inappearance than in substance; of the danger that we might prove to have put forward, and had. rejected, a furthercompromise; and of the possible unsettling effect onMoslems and princes of a further unsuccessful effort tosecure Congress support.   Nor do I overlook that in such circumstances Congress and Moslems might combine topresent us with quite unacceptable demands, and leave us with the odium of rejecting them.    But I think we are bound to test every suggestion at this stage, in theinterest of leaving ourselves completely clear so far as

the public at home and overseas is concerned (unitedStates of America opinion in particular), as well as inthe interests of forwarding early and effectiveprosecution of the war and of securing if possible thefull mobilisation of India&apos;s effort in connection with it.   Apart from that, so far as changes at the Centreare concerned, while I am of course fully alive to thedifficulties involved, which I have frequentlyemphasised, if the impasse which confronts us could be resolved in no other way than by some adaptation of^afrullah Khan&apos;s scheme, I should say that we ought notto shrink from a situation now which in practice may well prove not to be more dangerous than that which was contemplated in connection with part II of the Act.    Thedifficulty to which I myself attach most weight is therisk I have already mentioned that Congress might decline to play on anything of the order I now describe without aguarantee of independence, etc., though if they were todecide to run out on that ground only, I think we shouldbe in a pretty strong position from the publicity pointof view.8.        The above, I recognise, takes no account of theposition of the Princes.    I do not see how I can get themin constitutionally on a scheme of an expanded centre suchas I have suggested.    I regard thorn as having themselvesto a considerable extent to thank for any difficulties that now confront us by their delays over Federation.But in any event they are a good deal easier to deal withthan the British Indian parties, since one need have no hesitation in putting them in direct touch with theCommander-in-Chief, etc. as regards the militaryprosecution of the war and since they would probably besatisfied by some arrangement which would keep them incontinuous touch with the Governor-General.

9.       The only effective alternative I see to somethingsuch as I suggest is a complete break which will, I am confident, early involve a struggle with all sections of congress, and a frank acceptance of what it involves interms of internal embarrassment here, possible misunder-standing in Parliament and in America and material for enemy propaganda.    If there is to be such a break, I andthe Governors clearly must be certain that in dealing with it resolutely we have the full support of the Cabinet andyourself, and if I have put forward, the proposalsdiscussed earlier in this telegram it is only because i feel, in the light of paragraph 1 of your telegram 793,that both you and the Cabinet will wish to know and consider, in view not only of the forthcoming debate, but.of much wider considerations, to what extent, and in whatdirection, I see any workable alternative.   You will not,I am sure, think that in even tentatively sketching what Ihave put forward I have done so without a full realisation of possible objections.    In measuring &quot;these I am profoundlyinfluenced by my conviction that a reactionary policy inIndia is not practicable politics and that a struggle now(though we may be unable to avoid one) while doing muchmischief at a most critical time, must in the end giveplace to a return to something like the scheme of the Act.But I am sure that we must now make up our minds and -decide to go through with whatever policy we adopt.Nothing could be more damaging or unsettling here thanthe feeling that we do not know our own minds and that weshall be ready to have one additional concession after another screwed out of us.    There are of course strong arguments for facing a break now, on the basis of my statement, but the arguments against, if a break can be

avoided on-reasonable-.terms, are., -cogent.    I would not,however^, as at present advised, go further in the way ofadditional concessions to avoid a break than I havesuggested above.Copy of telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroydated 22nd October 1959,793Private and personal.   Your private and personal telegram, 22nd October, 2367-S.   Sam Hoare is principalspeaker on Thursday and I will put to him the points you suggest in this and previous telegrams.   Meanwhile hehas himself suggested that as the debate may be difficult and as in his view it will in fact be impossible to postpone constitutional discussions till after the war,he might be permitted to say that if provincial autonomygoes on working well during the war there is no reason why discussions should not begin.before the end of it.I should be glad of your views.    I myself see noobjection, since such a statement will improve our moralposition in the event of a break, while in the unlikely event of continued co-operation Hoare is probably right in thinking that as in the last war we shall find itimpossible to defer discussions if the war is prolonged.2. Hoare would be grateful for up-to-dateappreciation of the position just before the debate,which I suggest you despatch not later than Wednesdaymorning.3- He has asked what exactly Consultative Committeewill do and on what subjects it will be consulted.   Youwill no doubt telegraph by Wednesday if you have anything to add to your telegram of the 18th October, 2316-S.
