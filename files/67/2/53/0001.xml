1. present Eire is represented diplomatically ina number of countries whore her interests are most considerable.-or where there are a large number of persons of Irish origin.In all other countries the Government of Eire have theadvantage of using the British Diplomatic Missions as achannel of communication with the foreign Government concerned and for the protection of their nationals.    Whilst thepresent procedure is, no doubt, of great value to individualSire Nationals, who can now appeal to British diplomatic missions for assistance in foreign countries, it is doubtfulwhether the withdrawal of British Diplomatic assistance inforeign countries, where, in any case, Eire has few importantinterests, would embarrass that Government seriously.Moreover, it would be open to them, in accordance withwell-known diplomatic procedure, to arrange with a foreign government to take charge of Sire&apos;s interests abroad.    Thewithdrawal, therefore, by t he United Kingdom Government ofthese facilities from the Eire Government would not have any appreciable effect.    Similarly, the discontinuance ofthe supply to the Government of Eire of information on foreignaffairs, which has hitherto been supplied to them, as to otherMembers of the British Commonwealth, is not likely to embarrassthem seriously.2.    On the assumption that at some future date Eire mightgrant us active co-operation in defence matters, it has beenthe practice to supply the Government of Eire with confidential information on defence matters, and so far as possible, toencourage them to adopt similar armaments and methods oftraining to those used in the United Kingdom.    There is noreason

reason to believe that this confidence, in the supply of military information, has been in any way abused in the past.    Thecontinued supply of such information has in fact been appreciatedby the Government of Eire both for its own value and as a mark of confidence.    There is, however, no reason to suppose that towithdraw these facilities now would   operate ircraously to the detriment of the Government of Eire, who would probably findlittle difficulty in obtaining such technical advice or information as they required from &quot;foreign sources.    On theother hand, if the Government of Eire were to have recourse toforeign countries for this purpose, no doubt  they would also be led to purchase their armaments from foreign sources, with someconsequential detriment to United Kingdom trade.3* ?.2f.^A0il...Pll Individuals .3*    The legal problems relating to nationality which mightariSQ, should Eire leave the Commonwealth,  are being considered separately:    this memorandum has been drawn up on the assumptionthat if Eire became a foreign country a considerable proportionat any rate of those persons, who are now citizens of Eire, wouldin consequence lose their status as British subjects.    Thepractical aspects requiring consideration, may be set out asfollows: -4.    Eire at present is a source of recruitment to all theServices to a varying degree,  especially for the supply0i officers,,       At present the Government of Eire have notaiscouraged the recruitment of Eire citizens,  so long asit did not take place within the borders of Eire,  and moreover,bnsy have raised no objections to men in the United Kingdomi01&apos;ces going to Eire on leave, so long as they do so inPlain clothes,.     The Government of Eire would be unlikely to- &apos; maintain

maintain this benevolent attitude&apos; should relations betweenthe tv/o Governments deteriorate.     from e legal point of view,it would still be possible to recruit Eire citizens and grantthem commissions, even if they were regarded under UnitedKingdom law as aliens, and from the point of view ofInternational Law,  such recruitment would not be inconsistent with Eire1s position as an independent neutral, providedorganised recruiting did not take place within hire herself.It must,however, be remembered that the inclusion of eire citizens in United Kingdom forces when the relations betweenthe two Governments are strained, might have prejudicialeffects upon discipline, besides adversely affecting theposition of persons with Irish connections who are already in the Forces.5,     It is difficult to estimate the precise effect uponlabour conditions of any change in the  status of Eire withouta knowledge of what categories of individuals would stillbe regarded as British subjects.    Generally speaking,  it maybe said that the control of aliens desiring to enteremployment can be applied only at the time of their entry into this country^     Aliens who have been here before theimposition of control of their entry into the labour marketare not liable to any restrictions.      Setting aside,therefore, the position of Eire Nationals already in thiscountry, there is considerable movement of seasonalagricultural workers from Eire to Lancashire, Cheshire andsurrounding counties,  to the west of bootland, and also tosome extent to East Anglia.      In view of the general shortageof agricultural labour, any interference in the supply ofthis labour, whilst not regarded as vital, would be deprecatede spe c i al ly

eSpecially in time of war.    A certain number of EireNationals are at present employed in the Mercantile Marine,and any measures which might discourage Eire Nationals fromthis service would be deprecated, as in time, under war conditions, there is likely to be a shortage of sailors..Others are employed as navvies in civil engineering work or as dock labourers.    Some of these tend to drift later into other employment on lower wages than our own workers, anathis movement has raised protests from organised Labour,notwithstanding the contacts between the Trade Unions inGreat Britain and in Eire.      (See Appendix I relating toImmigration from Eire,)    Whether in any of these cases,however,a change in the national status of citizens of Sire wouldhave any effect on the numbers seeking or obtaining employment is doubtful.    Eire nationals who come to this country, or whoenter the Mercantile Marine, do so in order to better theircondition and not because they sympathise with the views ofthe United Kingdom Government,    In time of war,  improvedconditions in this country and a possible deterioration inthe employment position In Eire are likely to continue todraw them to the United Kingdom, unless, which appearsunlikely, the Eire Government impose an effective prohibition on emigration.6,     Many workers of Irish origin have, however, been inthis country for some time, ana it is,  therefore difficult togauge the effect on employment of any change in their nationalstatus but there is no evidence to suggest that anysubstantial difference would be made to the employmentfigures.    In places where there is a largo proportionof&apos; I^ish, as for instance, in Liverpool and Glasgow, anydeterioration

deterioration in relations between the two countries,  orattempts to subject Eire Nationals to control, might result in breaches of the peace and in any event would causemuch trouble to the police, particularly in view of the traditional antipathy between the Irish Catholics andthe Scottish or Irish Protestants in these areas?      In addition,the local authorities would probably argue that,  on Eirehe coming a foreign country, they should be relieved of atleast some part of the burden which now falls on them in providing poor law and social services for    the manypoorer Irish people resident in their area.    FailingExchequer assistance, there might be demand for the deportation of those who had &quot;become a public charge, whichwould probably lead, to friction -with the remaining Irish.7*    An important consequence of any policy which entailedserious pressure by the United Kingdom upon Eire would bethe necessity for increasing the garrison of the NorthIreland District,    The present garrison is calculatedtote sufficient to deal with such minor disorders as arealways liable to arise in Ireland.,      Before a policy liableto alienate Eire was adopted the garrison would have to beincreased.      If, as a result of such a policy Eire,  or any considerable portion of her population, became activelyhostile, a large increase in our garrison v/ould become necessary.      We might need to employ as much as two divisions in North Ireland District.      On military grounds a policy whichentailed the risk of a serious detachment of force, such as this, while we were at war would be deplorable.8. Any change in the constitutional position of Eirewould have an unfortunate effect upon the position of theLoyalists

Loyalists there.      These people would, he faced, with theunpleasant alternatives of renouncing their sympathies andassociations with the United Kingdom, or of running serious risk of discriminatory treatment from the Eire authorities,or of leaving the country.C,   T rade Ke 1 ations.90     The weakening of the economic link between the twocountries, whether as the result of direct retaliatory action by the Eire Government or indirectly as the result of any dispute, must have serious effects on the economy of both -and in time of war we are in a bad position to stand theconsequences.      ,.e have no bargaining power to safeguard ourimportant and preferential export trade to Eire,   and. our need cf food.stu.ffs from Eire is likely to stand in the wayof our taking action against them;    it is, however, equallytrue to say that,  so long as the present channels of trade are maintained, Eire  is very dependent upon us for certain ofthe foodstuffs, e.g&apos;.  sugar, and certain of the raw materials of food production e.g.  fertilisers feeding-stuffs andseeds, that she has to import.     The damage to our exporttrade would be serious in war-time %    it would also involvethe breaking off of trade connections which will, be mo-re than ever needed after the war as an outlet for United Kingdom trade10.     A particularly difficult problem would arise inconnection with the Trade Agreement of Aprils  1938, underwhich we guaranteed to Eire goods freedom of duty or preferential rates of duty.      This Agreement runs for 3 years from May 19th.1938, and there seems no reason to hold that Eire&apos;s leaving theCommonwealth would entitle us &quot;i:o regard it as terminated.If? however, we continued to grant Eire preferential rates of duty, those rates would become claimable by foreign countriesgenerally

generally under the most-favoured nation clauses of their commercial treaties with us.    (it is true, no doubt,  that asimilar problem v/ould arise for Eire).    Even, however, ifit were found possible to withdraw from Eire the benefit ofthe preferential rates of duty, this change would leaveunaffected something like half of Sire * s exports to thiscountry in respect of items which are free of import dutyeven if of foreign origin.    These include live cattle, sheep,horses and pirs, hides and raw souJ..    On the other hand,certain fairly important items would become liable to duty orto increased rates of duty, these would include beer, butter,eggs, bacon, poultry and potatoes, and might possibly load tothe loss of certain indo.strj.eo from Eire, e.go Guinness.11.    Prom the point of view of the loss that would result to Eire, consideration needs alcro to be given to our war-timecontrols (i) of imports, and (ii)  of exports.      These are capable of being effected with greater or less severity inparticular cases by purely administrative action.12,,     As regards (1) (import control)  the existing import prohibition Order applies to a long list of goods, but theyare mostly manufactured articles of little interest to Eire asan exporter,    Poultry is however included.13.      The object of the prohibition, which is of coursesubject to the grant of import licences, is primarily tosafeguard our exchange position,.,     So long as Eire currencyremains linked with sterling there would be no object on this account in restricting imports from Eire,      In fact, all goods are at present freely admitted.from   Eire under an Open Generallicence.    This could be,    and for treaty reasonswould probably need to be, withdrawn if Eire left theC ommonwealt) i,

Commonwealth, hut it would, he possible even so to relaxthe severity of the prohibition to any desired, extent infavour of Eire products by the grant of licences.    In respect0f commodities which we need. from. Eire, as e.g. articlesof food, it would probably be necessary to grant licences with considerable freedom for any such articles included in theImp or t prohibited List.14*     As to (ii) - the export control - the prohibitionsunder the existing Export of Goods (Prohibition) Order applymainly to foodstuffs, animal feeding stuffs and rawmaterials, but a certain number of manufactured articlesare included,  amongst them, agricultural machinery, petroleum,petrol, lubricating oil and motor vehicles.15oj An Open General Export Licence    was issued immediatelyafter the Prohibition Order exempting all exports to Eireexcept wheat-meal and flour, sugar, raw silk, certainpreserved foods and a few other items.      This Open GeneralLicence would no doubt need to be withdrawn if Eire left theCommonwealth and. under the definitions contained in theProhibition Order her departure would seem automatically to involve her inclusion amongst the &quot;dangerous destinations&quot;(contiguous neutral countries) under Prohibited List &quot;C&quot;*    Onthe other hand we could here again relax the prohibition toany desired extent by granting specific export licences and inrespect of items of substantial interest to mire such asanimal feedingstuffs.   vie should no doubt have to do so, to theextent justified by the  supply situation and our own requirements.,m order to enable her to continue to produce the foodstuffswhich we require.16.      Supplies of foodstuffs from Eire are of special importance to us in view of the short sea transit and consequenteconomy

economy of shipping space.    Moreover,  supplies which we could not longer obtain from Sire might need to he replaced to an appreciable extent by supplies from &quot;dollar&quot; countries whichwould be difficult and wasteful from the e xchange as well as fromthe shipping point of view.      In addition to foodstuffs, Eiresupplies small quantities of certain raw materials, e.g. hides,sheep and lamb shins, wool, flax,  iron and steel scrap and waste,non-ferrous scrap and waste and timber. In spite of their small quantities, in mast-., cases it. is inporfcant ihattlie^Blxuld. be maintained assupplies will be very short.      It can, however, be argued that even should Eire desire to sell her products to neutral countries,   she has no alternative market, and our contraband control could prevent her selling to the enemy.    Experience,moreover,  shows that so long as finance and shipping is available,all neutral producers of foodstuffs are only too anxious tosell their produce.17.*     The damage which United kingdom export trade to Eirewould be likely to suffer is difficult to estimate because itwould depend so largely on the action that Eire saw fit to take in the circumstances.      It may, however, be noted that if theTrade Agreement of April 1938 could be terminated by Eire,  or if she were to disregard it, we should lose the benefit of numeroustrade concessions negotiated with some difficulty which are embodied in it, notably the virtual exclusion from Eire of coal,  coke and manufactured fuel of non-United Kingdom origin.    United kingdom exports of these goods ,are worth some  2^ million a year.    Theother concessions include duty-free entry for fish, certainfeedingstuffs, hops, and a long list of semi - and fully -manufactured articles specially chosen for their importanceto United Kingdom export trade.      The Agreement also securesthat when licences for duty-free importation are granted in eire

sire for particular classes of goods of United Kingdom or Empirerigin, duties of net less than 10% shall be charged oncorresponding foreign goods-      Further the agreement abolishes orreduces a number of charges leviable on United Kingdom goods(Customs Emergency duties, minimum charge of Customs Duty, StampDuty and Package Tax), and it provides for a review of protective duties by the Sire Prices Commission on the principle that theduties and other import restrictions on United Kingdom goods shallbe replaced by duties only, which shall not exceed such a level as -will give United. Kingdom producers full opportunity of reasonablecompetition^      These reviews have already led to a number of concessions of value to the United Kingdom export trade, notably the disappearance of quotas which have always been a sore pointwith bur exporters:    while certain industries in Eire and theUnited Kingdom, notably the cotton industry, rather than go beforethe Commission, have  come to amicable agreements between themselves for adjusting the Eire duties and quotas on their productions inaccordance with the above principle.-IS..     It is net of course possible to give any exact estimateof the benefit derived by United Kingdom export trade from these concessions? but it may be noted that the value of United kingdom exports showed a noticeable increase after the entry into forceof the Agreement as under(valueues in &apos;000 &apos;s,1938 :        19391st half    : . 2nd half.    :      1stJnBlt^9,852      :      10,411        :        10,91619o   The balance of United Kingdom trade with Eire is substantially favourable to the United Kingdom, the balance beingattributable mainly to re-exports as shown in the attachedtable.  (Appendix II).D.

gO.    The Eire currency is at present on a sterling standard and is maintained at parity with sterling;    and the Banking system is for all practical purposes interlocked with that of the UnitedKingdom.      The Eire Banks have considerable sterling assets, of-the order of  70,000,000 net, and in addition Eire residents holda substantial volume of sterling investments.&apos; 21*   So long as Eire is content to keep her resources in sterling (which on economic grounds is the natural course for her to follow) these balances and investments present no particular difficulty to the United Kingdom.      Should she however leave theCommonwealth there would be every reason to expect her to seek agreater degree of independence in her financial system and the dislocation thereby caused might be a matter of some concern tothe United Kingdom.    In the first instance she would certainly wishto remove balances from London to New York with which to importgoods which cannot be obtained from sterling sources, or whoseimport is at present rationed.      There is also the wider question that she might attempt to establish her currency on a dollarbasis instead of on sterling, a course which though economicallyunwarrantable might be embarked upon on political grounds.22.      It could accordingly be expected that she would attemptto convert part of the sterling holdings into dollars, by sellingsterling in the New York market.      This if carried out on a large scale over a short period might involve her in considerable loss,kut a substantial sum could probably be transferred over the courseof a year.

8.3c    Such transfers would of course he highly unwelcome tothe United Kingdom Control, hut the only effective remedy wouldbe to block Sire balances and investments entirely.      This would imply the most drastic discrimination against Sire as comparedwith other neutrals and would be difficult to justify.,      in viewmoreover of the extent of dealings between the two countries thepractical problems of successfully operating exchange controlvis-a-vis Eire cannot be ignored;    in particular an effectivecensorship of communication between the two countries and. controlof the land frontier with Northern Ireland- would be the firstrequisites.24.    There is little doubt that for Sire to separate herfinancial system from that of the United. Kingdom would involve herno less than ourselves in difficulties, and might in the long runprove disastrous for her.      In the short view, however, the over-riding consideration is that Eire being a creditor of thiscountry for a substantial sum has the power to cause usconsiderable embarrassment by calling on us to repay at a mostinconvenient moment.E.CONCLUSIONS.

E. 0pNCLU3I0K8.25.     The conclusion which it is suggested should bedrawn from the above is that while there are several measureshy which pressure could be exerted on the Government of Eire,these measures are likely to affect detrimentally theinterests of this country either directly or indirectly,More generally it seems necessary to take into account the probable losses which would result from any serious deterioration in cur present relations with Eire.    From aneconomic point of view the history of the former disagreementswith the Eire Government shows that any attempt to &quot;bringeconomic pressure to bear on that country has the effect of encouraging the policy of increasing the  self-sufficiency of&quot;dire.    It is probably true to say that no action by theGovernment of Eire could make that country completely self-sufficient, but it would be possible, by the encouragement of secondary industries, to do serious and irrevocabledamage to British trade interests in Eire.26.    Any attempt on the part of the United Kingdom tobring serious pressure to bear upon Eire with a view tocompelling her to abandon her attitude of neutrality might provoke serious reactions in some at any rate of the Dominions,especially Canada and the Union of South Africa,  on purelyconstitutional grounds.    It is important too to bear in mind the dangerous possibilities which an overt breach with Eiremight present in its effects on the sympathies of the largeIrish population abroad, especially in the United States ofAmerica, and the political consequences of any such alienationof Irish feeling, whilst it would add seriously to our military commitments in the Northern Ireland District.Moreover,

Moreover, the effect on the ceiasiderahle Irish communities in the Dominions of a position in which Eire became aforeign country and residents in Sire &quot;became aliens mightbe serious.27*     It is understood that the object of bringing pressure to bear upon Sire to an extent which might result in Sireleaving the British Commonwealth would he to obtain for ourselves the full facilities we require in defence matters,including a base for the operation of our anti-submarine forces,both chips and aircraft.,    The question whether the need fortiidse facilities and the advantages to hp derived from them are so great as to outweigh all the disadvantages which might result from a breach with Sire is a general matter of policy with whichit is not within the scope of the present report to deal.    Itshould,  however:, be added that it seems very doubtful whether any pressure which we could bring to bear upon Sire in thevarious directions to which reference has he en made above would,m Tact, induce the Government, of Dire to accord us the-facilities desired, while a &quot;breach with Hire would result inhi loss of such co-operation, whatever it may be worth, as&amp;e Government of Si.re are at present disposed to accord,.

APPENDIX I.(See paragraph 5)IMMIGRATION JgGH 2XEjgThe latest available infonnaticn as to the number&quot; of irish born persons resident in Great Britain relates to1931 (Census of Population) .    These figures show that thetotal number of Irish boP-*n persons in Great Britain in 1931was approximately 505,000, of whom 359,000 (71 par cent)were from Mire, and the remainder from Northern Ireland.The cities in which the largest numbers of Mire born persons were resident in 1931 were London (86,741 or 24*2 per cent of the total of Mire born persons in   the  country), Glasgow(23,260 or 6.5 per cent), Liverpool (21,094 or 5.3 per cent)and Manchester (13,184 or 3.7 per cent),    Substantial numbers are, however, to be found in many other cities and towns,including Birmingham, Edinburgh, Salford, Plymouth, Leeds,Birkenhead, Portsmouth, Beetle, Cardiff, Bristol andSheffield.Complete information is not available as to themovement from Mire into this country since 1931, but some indication of the general trend is provided by the figuresrelating to applications for    Unemployment Books.    Completeinformation regarding the numbers entering insured employmentin Great Britain has only been available since April. 1937,the figures collected, prior to that date being in respectof migrants who were previously insured, in Eire;    it isestimated that this class represents rather less thanone Quarter of the total number of migrantsentering insured employment In this country,, These(incomplete)

1932 2,2051933 1,6141934 1,7441935 2,3841936 6,063Arrangements were made early in 1937 to collect fulland detailed statistics as to the number of migrants from Eireentering insured employment in Great Britain, and these figures are as follows:-1937 (April to December)    20,9771938 (January to December)18,9531939 (January to July)       10,826Of the 19,000 who entered in 1938,  8,000 or 42 per centobtained employment in London, 3,400 03^ 18 per cent in the NorthWestern Division,  2,550 or 12.4 per cent in the Midlands, and1,750 or 9,2 per cent in Scotland,      The main industries in whichthese men found employment were the hotel, public house,restaurant and club services (4,300 or nearly 23 per cent),  building(3,200 or 17 per cent), public works contracting (4,200 or 22 per-cert), agriculture and gardening (2,300 or 12 per cent), and the distributive trades  (1,200 or 6 per cent).      Of the 2,300 whofound employment in agriculture, nearly 1,700 were non-domiciledtemporary seasonal workers;    it may reasonably be assumed that thegreat majority of the latter returned to Eire on the completion oftheir seasonal employment.While a considerable proportion of the migrants from Eireobtained employment in the civil engineering industry, the numbersghtering the coal mining industry and shipping service were verysmall;

smalU    during the period of eighteen months from January 1938to July 1939   only 23 migrants   obtained   employmentin coal mining- and 20 in the shipping service.      The formerdoubtless obtained work in non-scheduled surface occupationssince entry to the industry has been effectively controlled since1927 through the operation of restrictions under Section 18 ofthe Mining Industry Act, 1926,It is known that a proportion of the migrants entering GreatBritain return to Sire after a period of employment in GreatBritain.      Full information regarding the extent of this returnmovement is not available but estimates have been made on thebasis of the figures of passenger movement.      The following extractfrom an article in the Board of Trade Journal dated 9th March1939 provides an indication of the size of the return movement:-&quot;Prior to 1938, there was an inflow from Sire to GreatBritain in the earlier months of the year followed by an exodusin the last quarter.      In 1938 there was an inward movement ofabout 22,000 in the first half followed by a return movement inthe third and fourth quarters of about 6,000.&quot;
