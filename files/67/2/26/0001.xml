cjJLG1L39T.75.COPY no war CABINET.BOFORS GUNS.Memorandum by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence.viouserences: -(39) 55thelusionsute 7, &amp;.(39) 57thelusions,ute 7. J7My colleagues will recollect that we have recentlybeen negotiating with the Swedish Government regarding thenon-delivery of Bofors guns outstanding on our pre-warcontracts.By invitation of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, I have recently been dealing in this matter direct with   M. Boheman of the Swedish War Trade Mission.    At myinstance, M. Boheman returned to Sweden to discuss thematter with the Swedish Government and I have now receivedfrom him the letter attached hereto as Annex I.2. My colleagues will see that the letter fromM. Boheman touches on three main points:-The handing over of Bofors guns to Turkey.The delivery of guns to us from Hungary.The offer of recoil springs from Sweden.Handing over of guns to Turkey;.3. From paragraph 8 of the letter, it will be seenthat the Swedish Government is prepared, though somewhatunwillingly, to hand over to Turkey 24 guns alreadyconstructed and now in Sweden, under the following conditions  (which were separately communicated to GeneralOrbay of the Turkish Mission) s-(i) That written permission is given by the BritishGovernment.

(ii)    That an undertaking is given that the gunswill not he re-exported hy Turkey toGreat Britain,,(iii)    That payment is made through the BritishGovernment0(iv)    That the Turkish Government themselveswrite to the Swedish Government asking for the guns to he supplied.There is no mention of ammunition in theletter.    The Turks have asked for a 1,000 rounds pergun, and I suggest that the Swedes should he asked to deliver 2h,000 rounds with the gunsn    Should theyrefuse, the War Office, according to my information,could start to supply ammunition to Turkey from February19UG onwards, the intervening period being used hy theTurks for training purposescMy colleagues are aware that the Turks havehitherto refused to pay for this equipment from Swedenfrom their gold loan, and have continually pressed forthe necessary foreign exchange to be made availahleagainst their armaments credit0The approximate sum involved will he as follows:-2h guns -    96^0002hy000 rounds     -    Lp2,000Total -  138,000The amoiuit now involved is, therefore, much smaller than originally anticipated,,    It is verydesirahle to obtain the removal of the &quot;suspensive&quot;clause in the Turkish Treaty, and the Turkish government might he asked whether this further financial sacrificewould facilitate its removaloGuns due from Hungary on our Bofors contracts.he Details of the items still outstanding on ourBofors contracts are given in Annex II, and it will he seen

that a considerable amount of equipment was to have been supplied from Hungarian sources.     All this Hungarianequipment is overdue and no deliveries have been made sincethe outbreak of war.     The Hungarian sub-contract was of course, arranged by the Bofors Company and not by theSwedish Government.Accordingly, 1.1. Boheman, in paragraph 5 of his letteradopts the attitude that the delivery of these outstandingHungarian items is a matter to be arranged between theBritish and Hungarian Governments direct and that theSwedish Government can do nothing to assist.I suggest that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should approach the Hungarian Government with aview to obtaining delivery.Offer of recoil springs from Sweden.5. I also raised with M. Boheman the question of ourobtaining 200 complete sets of spare parts for ourselvesfrom Sweden.     Accorcling to paragraph 9 of Li. Boheman&apos;sletter, the Swedes are unable to supply these spares.     Inparagraph 10, however, an offer is made of recoil springsin large quantities with rapid delivery, and I have taken steps to communicate this offer to the Ministry of Supply.Rec ommendati ons.6. My recommendations for future action in this somewhatcomplicated matter are as follows(a) That in view of the arguments putforward in M. Boheman&apos;s letter, wemust perforce acquiesce in theSwedish Governments attitude towardsBofors deliveries to ourselves.

(b) That I should he authorised to informMo Boheman and the Turkish Mission that theWar Cabinet has approved the transfer to turkey of 24 Bofors guns due on our eontraots,and that the British Government will pay the approximate cost of  96,000 against theTurkish credit;    adding the hope, thatthis concession will bring nearer theremoval of the suspensive clause.(c) That I should he authorised to urge theSwedish Authorities to provide 24,000 roundsof Bofors ammunition for Turkey, the approximate cost of  42.,000 being found asin (b) above.Failing provision from Sweden, the necessaryammunition to be provided by the War Officefrom February, 1940 onwards.(d) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should be invited to take up with the hungarian Government,  the non-delivery ofthe items of the Bofor: sub-contracts placedin Hungary.(intld,)    Coichmond Terrace, S. W. 1.,&quot;7th November, 1939.

MINlSTEFuDDESAIRES ETRANGEF.ES.Secretaire General,Stockholm, November 1st, 1939cStrictly confidential and personal.Dear Lord Chatfield,With reference to our conversation the day before i left London I beg to give you the following information with regard to the question of the Bofors guns0lo The contract of 1937 for delivery from Bofors tothe British Government provided for the delivery from theBofors plant of 100 40 mm0 anti aircraft guns and 500o000rounds of ammunition^     Later another 100=000 rounds ofammunition was added0      At the outbreak of the war 64 gunsand 425o000 rounds of ammunition had been delivered,,20 In accordance with the Swedish neutrality rulesthe delivery of the remainder of the guns (36) was stoppedat the outbreak of the war together with the remainder ofthe ammuni t i o n c3c The subcontracts for delivery to the UnitedKingdom from Poland and Hungary could not be effectuatedafter the outbreak of the war with regard to Poland forobvious reasons,- with regard to Hungary because of theattitude of the Hungarian Government,,      I wish to point outthat the Hungarian guns need not at all he shipped viaSweden as nothing is done to them there0     Further delivery of Hungarian guns must therefore he a matter between theBritish and Hungarian Governments and the Swedish government can do nothing in this regard.      10 Hungarian guns beinghowever at the outbreak of the war at Gothenburg, they fellunder the Swedish export restrictions.4. The 36 Swedish guns intended for delivery to GreatBritain and the 10 Hungarian guns at Gothenburg were

requisitioned by the Swedish Government for urgent needs-.Of these 46 guns 22 were later sent to Finland when thatcountry became menaced by the Soviets; the remaining 24 arestill at Bofors.5. I have gone very carefully into the producingcapacity of Bofors with regard to 40 mm. guns.     everything that they can produce under the whole of next year iscommandeered by the Swedish Government to meet the urgentneeds of the Swedish Defenceeforces with the exception ofsome deliveries of a minor character to another neutral country namely Holland.     The whole of the Bofors plant isnow working very hard to fulfil the demands of the Swedish.Government and in spite of that considerable delays occur inthe delivery of Swedish commands.6. The spare parts which have been demanded by theWar Office are nothing else than the 36 guns in theircomponent parts,     New spare parts cannot be delivered fora very long time, the whole plant as said above working for urgent Swedish requirements,,7. The Swedish Government have been approached by both the Finnish and Norwegian Governments with a view of acquiring the 24.guns at Bofors.     They are urgently needed by both Governments in view of the political situation.The Finns may very soon have to fight.     In the Russian-Finnish negotiations Russian demands have also been putforward with regard to Petsame which the Russians wish tofortify.     That may be a forerunner to Russian demandswith regard to the north of Norway.     Can this not be a menace to Great Britain too?8. The Swedish Government would earnestly wish tomeet these demands from the other northern states which haveno industrial resources whatsoever to rely on in this respect.

Provided there is no outbreak of war in the North as aresult of the Russo-Pinnish tension the Swedish Governmenthowever in view of the conversations I have had in. london is prepared to deliver the 24 guns to Turkey if the BritishGovernment should so wish and consider that it is really- more important that Turkey should have those guns thanthat they should remain in the North.     This means a heavysacrifice on the part of the Swedish Government0      should this delivery take place 88 of the guns intended forGreat Britain would have been delivered to Great Britainor a Government with which they have a close collaboration.The Swedish Government consider that the 12 remaining gunsplus the 10 Hungarian guns have -found an employ v/hich maynot be incompatible with British interests.     No furtherdelivery to Turkey can take place within a considerable time limit as there is no capacity whatsoever at Bofors.9/ As to spare parts there is no capacity at present at Boforso10o One subcontractor of Bofors, the Lesjofors AB,are however prepared to&apos;deliver (recoil) springs to 40 mm.guns in large quantities and very rapidly to the BritishGovernment and licences will be granted for this export.I gather that these springs form an essential part of thefabrication of these guns and that the Swedish springs areof a superior quality.,11. I have done everything I can to arrange thatBritish wishes are met.     More than what I have outlined above the Swedish Government cannot do now as there is no more material possibilities.Will you let me know at your earliest convenienceyour wishes on the basis of this letter.Yours very sincerely,iy. Hon. Lord Ohatfield, (Signed)    BOHEMAN.&quot;,C-B,, K.O.M.G., C.V.O.,London. &quot;&apos;&quot;
