cument is the property cp his britannic majesty !s govbriment)copy no.-war cabinet.india and burma (miscellaneous amendments) bill.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Lndia0The provisions of this Bill as introduced this sessionwere all approved by the Cabinet as the result of three separatereferences to them in my memoranda dated 21st October, 1938(CP. 233(38; ) ,  and 19th January (0. P.9(39)) and 24th March,1939 (H.a.16(39)),        The Bill was passed by the House ofLords and two cla.y,ses of it were enacted as a seperateemergency measure    on the outbreak of war.      I had, however,to postpone proceeding with it in the House of Commons, since &apos;it would have been necessary when the Bill came up,to insert a new clause by amendment which would have been veryprovocative to the Congress Party in India, and just at thetime when the opportunity for proceeding with the Bill arosethe   Viceroy was engaged in the recent negotiations whichhave proved in the end infructuous.I have thought it right to obtain the approval of the.War Cabinet to re-introducing the Bill early next session,more especially since I propose now to include in it, along with three other new amendments of an entirelyuncontroversial character,  the clause referred to in thepreceding paragraph, which may give rise to some controversy.The object of this clause is so to amend the provisions relating to the imposition of taxes on income as to place it

&quot;beyond question that a Bill passed a few months ago by theUnited Provinces Legislature at the instance of the CongressGovernment of that Province is ultra vires. That Bill has been reserved by the Governor for the consideration of theGovernor-General who has so far recorded no decision upon it,but has consistently taken the line that it will be verydifficult for him politically to withhold his assent fromthe Bill, as he certainly must, unless his action is justified by an amendment of the Act in the sense now contemplated. Itwas never intended when the Government of India Act wasframed that it should be within the competence of a Provincial,as distinct from the Central, Legislature to impose a tax ofthe Character of that which would be imposed by the united provinces Bill, which though described as an EmploymentsTax would be in effect a graduated income-tax, cdid. wouldincidentally fall with great severity on the members of thePublic    Services who happened to be employed in that Province.On the other hand, there is no doubt that, with theGovernment of India Act as it stands, it is open to argument that the Bill is not in fact ultra vires.It might be suggested that, since  the CongressGovernment which was responsible for this Bill has nowresigned and the Governor is in sole charge of theadministration of the Province, the considerations whichdeterred the   Governor-General from arbitrarily withholdinghis assent from the Bill are no longer relevant-    To this Ishould reply that it seems to me of much importance that theadministration of the Provinces by the Governors, for whichwe are now responsible,  should not create the impression that their policy is directed towards reversing ormodifying the projects of the late congress Governments, and

accordingly that I should regard the present circumstances as making the amendment even more necessary than it was &quot;beforeThe amendments which will be effected by the bill are such that they can be accurately described as designed toremove mistakes or ambiguities which must be removed inorder to secure the proper working of the   Act and thatthey in no way prejudice the decision as to the. fo:miwhichtthe future Central Government of India should t alee.(initialled)    Z.Office,Whitehall, S.W.I.th November, 1939.aond Terrace, S.
