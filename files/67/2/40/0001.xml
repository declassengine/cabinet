nmfflWT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. 1OOPY NO.   Y,\89.WAR   CABINET.ANALYSIS OF IMPORTING CAPACITY.Note by the Minister of Shipping.At their meeting on the 10th of November, 1939,the War Cabinet invited me to submit to them as early as possible an analysis showing the amount of shippingestimated to be available, and the requirements of departments, over the periods ending -(i) 31st December, 1939,(ii) 31st March, 1940, and(iii)30th June, 1940oI now circulate an estimate, prepared by Sir WilliamElderton, of the imports which -could, on a number ofassumptions, be brought into the United Kingdom in thefirst year of war.The estimate assumes that, excluding oil, theimport programme can be reduced from a normal import of about 59 million tons weight to 47 million tonsweight, a decrease of about 12 million tons.This total may be subdivided as follows1.000 tons.Commodities controlled by ministry of FoodCommodities specifically coveredby Ministry of supply programme, including molassesMiscellaneous and unallocateditems19,80023,9003,30047,000,000This subdivision is not an attempt actually todetermine priorities between the Ministry of Food and theMinistry of Supply but has been adopted as offering,-1-

prima facie., a basis of calculation.After allowance has been made for probable sources of origin, for the length of voyage required under war conditions and for loss of carrying capacity due, forexample, to the fact that it is not always possible to load a vessel to her marks, the conclusion is reached thatthis volume of imports could be &quot;brought in if there wereavailable for import work throughout the year 9% million gross tons of ocean-going shipping,For this purpose we rely upon the larger ocean-going ships of 1,600 gross tons and over, and of thesethere is available after allowing for requirements ofthe naval, military and Air Force services, about11,770,000 gross tons.Of this, 1,300,000 gross tons are on dominion and Colonial Registers and some 670,000 gross tons are onregular lines between (a) foreign and foreign,  (b) foreign and empire, and (c) empire and empire ports.     The balance is 9,800,000 tons.Adjustments have to be made for losses and forgains, e.g. through new building, and against the net loss has been set the importing capacity of the smallervessels not included in the opening figure of tonnage.An allowance, at present speculative, must bemade for French requirements and these are estimated asinvolving a net demand of 350,000 gross tons of british shipping.There appears at first sight almost enoughBritish tonnage to bring in the required imports duringthe year, but this inference would be fallacious.       as sir William Elderton points out, it would necessarily be many months before all the tonnage in cross trades couldbe brought into the direct importing programme of the

United Kingdom and It might not he practicable to makea complete transfer.       In September and October our imports were about 5 million tons after allowing for contrabandcargoes which had been seized.       On the suggestedprogramme of 47 million tons a year, November opens with a deficiency of nearly 3 million tons and it will be necessaryto import a balance of 42 million tons during the remaining10 months of the first year of the war.Of this it is hoped that some 31 million tons willbe imported In British vessels, leaving 11 million tons to be brought in foreign ships, or 57i$ of the quantitywhich foreign vessels would import during a normal periodof 10 months, as compared with an import in foreign vessels of some 40$ of the normal In the months of September and october.       These figures emphasise the importance ofincreasing imports in foreign vessels during the next 10months.The estimated programme of total imports in theimmediate future is as followsSeptember to October - 5     million tons (2 months)November to January   - 10-g-        &quot; &quot;February to April       - 12         11 &quot;At the end of January, the imports will be short byabout 4 million tons of the proportion of a year&apos;s importsat the rate of 47 million tons a year, and although in thenext succeeding 3 months there will be a slight excess overthe quota for 3 months, the arrears which accrued in thefirst 2 months of the war will not have been overtaken.These estimates have made some allowance for resort to nearsources of supply but not for a drastic concentration oftonnage upon the shortest routes.The estimates contained in Sir William Eldertonfsdeport are necessarily of a provisional character, subject

to many adjustments as &quot;better information &quot;becomes available,, but they emphasise the fact that in the nextfew months it will be difficult to fulfil even the reduced rate of Import assumed for the purposes of hiscalculations and that it will not be possible to accumulatestocks of those materials in respect of which we beganthe war on narrow or no marginsaAs a result of agreements concluded andchartering arrangements-made or being made in recent weeks, we may hope to increase substantially thevolume of neutral tonnage in allied service,&apos; but I must point out that no American vessels, which last yearbrought 350,000 tons and in 1937 500,000 tons of timberalone to this country, will be in our trade and that italian ships, so far as they come here at all, are coming in ballast0       The reluctance of some foreignowners and the greater reluctance of their seamen tocome, to belligerent ports is a handicap upon the chartering of neutral tonnage, the severity of which will vary with the fortunes of the war at sea,      Optimisticassumptions as to the voluntary entry into our trade of neutral tonnage may not be justified and it may become necessary to resort to pressure of various forms, inspite of any political objections there may be to suchaction, if we are to secure the necessary volume of neutral shippingoDrastic direction is &quot;being applied to british ships as to where and what they should loado     even greater intensity of control will be applied, but nothingcan suddenly or quickly repair the great gap caused in ourimporting programmes by the inevitable initialdislocation of shipping and the current delays from whichwe are suffering.,      It will be necessary to withdraw

OOAtonnage from many routes, the maintenance of which earnsfor us foreign currencies and is a material aid to theeconomic life of the Dominions as well as to our ownoommerce.     It may he necessary to proceed to ruthlesslengths and to abandon to the Japanese, the Americans andother neutrals, trades which it will take our merchantshipping long to recover, if they are recoverable at all.Something more can be done to concentrate shipping on the shorter routes, including the North Atlantic subject toconsiderations of foreign exchange and the reactions uponDominion exports, and as is pointed out in paragraph IS ofthe report drastic rearrangement of shipping, which couldonly be gradually effected, might eventually increase therate of import by about 15 per cent. Before this is done,I feel that not only should every cause of delay to shipping be reduced as far as practicable, but that everydepartment should consider applying at once every possiblemethod of economy In our internal consumption.J 2 GoMINISTRY OF SHIPPING.15TH NOVEMBER, 193SU

APPENDIX.1.    In an estimate of imports for the first year of the war,given in my memorandum of 3rd October, 1939, a figure of47,000,000 tons was given representing a decrease of about12,000,000 tons from a normal year.    The figures excluded oil.I have reconsidered this estimate and am satisfied thatit is reasonable.2.    The following statement gives in broad outline asub-division of this figure.    Provisional figures have beenreceived from the Ministry of Pood for a year&apos;s programme and,though no programme for a year has yet been received from theMinistry of Supply, we have had figures for three months towhich due regard has been paid.Thousand tons..Commodities controlled by Ministry of Pood 19,800Commodities specifically covered by ministry of Supply programme(including molasses; 23,900Miscellaneous items not included instatements of either Ministry(Tobacco, glass, vehicles, etc.) 2,100Unallocated 1,20047,0003.    The imports were subdivided into countries of origin,and the amount of shipping required was found by assuming a  .suitable number of round voyages per annum in respect of each country, adjusted to allow for loss of carrying capacity owing,e.g. to. the fact that it is not always possible to load a vessel down to her marks.    The lengths of voyages have beenadopted after consultation with Sir Vernon Thomson who has also discussed with us generally the adjustment of carrying capacity.

Dur-ing the earl/ months of the war, there will be additional delays owing to the institution- of the convoy systemetc. and allowance has been made for this in the estimates oftonnage required.4.    The conclusion reached is that we could import the47,000,000 tons if we had available for import work throughoutthe twelve months 9,500,000 gross tons of ocean-going shipping.5. The tonnage of vessels of 1600 gross tons and over,suitable for the transit of cargo, on the British Empireregisters, after allowing for the latest information as to therequirements of the Naval, Military and Royal Air Force services during the next year,  is about 11,770 thousand gross tons.Of this, 1,300 thousand gross tons are on Dominion and Colonialregisters, and some 670 thousand gross tons are trading abroadon regular lines between (a) foreign and foreign,  (b) foreign and Empire, and (c) Empire and Empire ports.    The balance oftonnage, after deducting these two groups is thus 9,800 thousandgross tons, but, subject to the points mentioned below(paragraph 6),  the figure may increase by the middle of 1941 toabout 10-^ million gross tons, and it may thereafter increase alittle more as a result of further diversion to the U.K. ofvessels on Dominion or Colonial registers or at present trading permanently abroad.*Of the 9,800 thousand gross tons mentioned above,2*200 thousand gross tons consist of Mixed Passenger and Cargoand 7,600 thousand gross tons are Cargo Liners and Tramps. .6.    It is necessary, however, to make allowance for losses and damage on the one hand, and new building on the other.As losses are spread over the year, the tonnage lost in the&apos;&apos;&apos;The tonnage may be increased by the transfer of vessels to ourflag, but this would not represent a real gain in importing capacity if such vessels had normally been importing goods tothis country or France.

first year will have contributed to imports-durwtg-tb-feared^ye-arrand losses are cumulative.   A similar adjustment requires to bemade- in respect of gains.   Against the net loss, we have the help of the smeller vessels which are not included in thestatement in paragraph 5, and these may be regarded as justabout sufficient to make up for the net losses in the first year and to allow for the lack of importing capacity in thoselarge vessels engaged wholly or partly on coastwise traffic.I conclude, therefore, that it is reasonable to use the figureas set out.7.   Allowance must also he made for the French requirements.France has been obtaining a large amount of coal from Germanyand Poland tnd this will now have to be obtained elsewhere and presumably from England:    we must also continue to provideher with the coal and other things she normally obtains from us.Bearing in mind that some of the tonnage used for exportingcoal etc. to France can be used, in part, to import goods from France, Portugal, Spain or North Africa, the loss from animporting point of view may be put as equivalent to about350,000 gross tons of shipping in the year to which the estimatesrelate.8.   It would appear, therefore, at first sight, that thereis very nearly enough tonnage to bring the imports, but muchof our tonnage is at present largely engaged abroad and itwould necessarily be many months (if ever) before all this couldbe brought into importing service.    It will be remembered that,ln the last war, even when things were somewhat desperate, wecould not immediately transfer all tonnage, which, on paper,aPPeared to he available;    the dominions and foreign countriescannot be starved of tonnage, though gradually neutral tonnagemight replace our own in certain parts of the world.

9,   In looking forward over the year, it must he rememberedthat, during September and October, our imports have been only about half the normal amount, and, though, as indicated in thememorandum of 3rd October, a substantial decrease was to beexpected for the first three months, the amount of imports mustbe increased during the rest of the year to make up the deficiency.    This means that, to produce 47,000,000 tons of goodsduring the year, we shall have to import at a yearly rate of52,000,000 tons for the last nine months of the first year ofwar.10.   The total of imports during September and October,apart from oil, allowing for contraband cargoes which have beenseized, is about 5 million tons, leaving a balance of 42 of the;47 million tons to be imported during the remaining ten monthsof the first year of the war.    Of this balance, it is reasonable to expect that some 31 million tons may be imported in british vessels, leaving II million tons to he brought in foreign ships.[This represents 57-g- per cent of the quantity which foreignIvessels would import during a normal period of ten months.during September and October, the available evidence suggeststhat the commodities imported in foreign vessels were only somefO per cent of the normal.    It follows therefore, that if theiotal of 47 million tons for the first year op the war is to beObtained, the imports brought hy foreign vessels must be increasediuhstantially during the next ten months:    so far as they fallpnort in the early months they must attain a higher percentageBf the normal subsequently (cf. paragraph 9).   After the first year of the war (unless losses increase) as British vesselsIpome more and more available, the proportion of foreign vesselsifiuired will diminish, or, alternatively, we may obtain moreImports.

It is noticeable that during October only half theentrances of foreign vessels were with cargo, although in normal times about 70 per cent come with cargo.    If foreignvessels could Tu-ing cargo in the normal proportion of cases,the position would at once become easier.11 a   Estimates -have also been made of the imports that willbe brought in shorter periods of three and six months from now,allowing for the initial delays etc. still being experienced.I estimate that we shall bring 10-g- million tons of imports inthe next three months, and we must bring an additional12? million tons in the following three months.12.    I have not assumed a drastic rearrangement of allshipping to the nearest possible source for every supply.    Ifthis were done, as was contemplated early in 1917 and to alarge extent put in force in that year and 1918, the amount ofimports could he increased by about 15 per cent with the same amount of shipping after the arrangements had been fully inoperation for- a complete year,The estimates in this memorandum are necessarilyprovisional, as we have not yet received full details of programmes etc from the -Supply departments,    It has been assumed that the character of the war will not change in sucha way as to affect the shipping position materially,-&apos; either&quot;by heavier losses, destruction of ports or otherwise.15th November, 1939
