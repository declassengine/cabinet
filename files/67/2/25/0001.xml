(6) We would like you to reiterate those views on conduct of-jyternational relations which we in Nev/ Zealand have consistentlyeXpressed (see my speech at Imperial Conference 1937,   secretreport of the third meeting, and note to Secretary-General, Leaguecf Nations dated 16th July, 1936).      You should reaffirm, our belief in collective peace ss^stem and ideals of League of Nations,  inframework of which we still believe effective guarantees against aggression do exist.(7) In formulating war aims the following considerations should beborne in mind:    of fundamental economic and political causes of warthe political must not be underrated.      The idea of dominationand expansion seems firmly fixed in some minds and threat to our own and other nations&apos;  security is of vital importance.      It is no doubta truism that there can be no peace on basis of one nation beingstronger than another but there seems to be no cure for that present unstable position unless each nation unconditionally is willing to give up some element of its sovereignty in favour of aninternational body under a system of collective security, or at least a federation of European States.(8) We are concerned at moment in fighting for a moral issuewherein we are urging substitution of discussion and peaceful settlement in place of use of force,  and to institute the rule oflaw and acceptance of principle of third-party judgment.    It isessential therefore that any peace should not confirm fruitfulness01 aggression nor should we buy peace at price of liberty ofsomeone else.     We should insist as a first condition of peacethat small nations and peoples shall be guaranteed their freedom.I9) Though our immediate object is plain enough - by any ending of aggression,  this is largely a negative aim and we must have something more positive.     Our ultimate aims must therefore be formulated

formulated in order to convince our own people that peace is worthstriving for and that only for this is war worth while winning.      Atthe same time we should seek to convince our opponents that they,with us,  can advance only in this manner.      We have, in short,  tooffer the German people some acceptahle alternative to their presentposition.      And there remains finally the urgent necessity ofconvincing neutral opinion that our cause is both just and isessential to their own security and welfare.(10) The ultimate aims of the Allies should include:-(a) outlaw aggression;(b) substitute discussion and negotiation for force;(c) guarantee each nation&apos;s security;(d) universal disarmament;(e) restoration of respect for sanctity of contracts.(This presupposes just treaties and effective means of modifying contracts by agreement,) \That may revive the League of Nations or a substitutetherefor or additional thereto;    for example, a federation ofEuropean States.(f) solution of economic questions;    e.g. ,  supplies of rawmaterials and essential goods;    transport facilities,&quot;exchange and finance;    ordered transit from war to peaceeconomy;(g) increase in welfare of mass of the peoples.      (No peace is worth while which does not result in raising living standards of peoples.)(ll) In stressing these views we know they are in full accord with your foundation principles and we desire you to present themsupported by your own case on behalf of Government.

t(12) In accordance with Menzies&apos; suggestion we have accepted hisinvitation to exchange views on the question of war aims, and acopy of this message is being repeated to him.M.  J.  SAVAGE.PRIME MINISTER.
