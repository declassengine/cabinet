1161XXXTelegram from Viceroy, dated 3rd November, 1939s25S7-SCPrivate and personal0     Situation this morning appearsstill to be that no accommodation has been reached on the partof Congress and Moslem League, and that each party is stillinsisting on its own claims0     Gandhi however is alleged to bespending a couple of days longer here*     Jinnah tells me hewill let me know if and when he desires a further interview,either accompanied or without Congress,20        Impression I get is that both parties areexperiencing difficulties0     Great attention is being focussedon these discussions,.     Absence of Moslem press accounts forCongress point of view, and criticisms of Moslems receiving more attention than facts justify,,      I have endeavoured to hint toPress desirability of urging on leaders the importance of understanding at this stage and discredit to indian political parties of complete failure to reach agreement.I should not be surprised if matters were reaching a point at which, given complete inability to come together, anddesirability at the same time of reaching some understanding,both parties might be prepared to consider some middlecoursec     Meanwhile, I have had feelers (though I suspect withnothing behind them) from Krishnamachari and Mirza Ismail.Both are clearly perturbed at position States may occupyif British India now reaches an internal agreement and states are outside,,    Ismail is very anxious that States should berepresented in any expanded Councils     Krislmamachari favours thePossibility of immediate move into Federation? andis fairly sanguine about success, provided that definite hopes can be held out of meeting the Princes as

regards qualified method of protecting their treaty rights.I think there is beginning to he a feeling amongst the princes that they may have missed the bus..3. Even if I receive a negative reply from Gandhi andJinnah, I do not think we can afford, or wisely agree,to allow these negotiations to break down and to adopta purely negative attitude towards constitutional advance and association of popular opinion in India with theconduct of the war.      That has always, as you know, beenmy view, and it is strengthened by turn of debate inLords yesterday (in which incidentally I should like to thank you for your admirable speach),     we havedeliberately postponed Federation on the ground that war(corrupt group)s would make it impossible for us toproceed with detailed work involved.      But that was twomonths ago, and much has happened since then.      We maywell find ourselves obliged now to conduct constitutionalinvestigationss at least as distracting as any inconnection with Federation would have been.

4, In these circumstances would the Cabinet, do you think,be prepared to allow me to have a shot at very early federationunder the Act if there seems the least prospect of a move inthat direction?      If so, I would wait until I had thought themoment had come and then proceed on something like these lines,(a) prepare the way as best I may with the Princes(? saying)    (This time I hope they will believe meunless they are very obtuse indeed) that this is thelast chance for terms of offer;(b) warn Moslems that so far as their plan for division ofIndia is concerned they are riding for a fall and advise &apos;;hem rather to secure themselves by appropriatesecurities taken from Congress and with the Princeswith whom they are already in close contact and sympathy;(c) get the Princes and Congress together informally,preferably through Dewans0      Congress would, have tohave a face-saver of some sort;(d) if things move well, anrjotaica early that His Majesty &apos;s Govern-ment fool that degree of agreement that has boon reachedamongst the (? parties) taken with their own extremeanxiety to bring in all parties,  and the Princes onthe same basis, in connection with the prosecution of the war, produce situation in which practicaldifficulties felt in an earlier stage aboutproceeding at once with the federal plan is removed and that they propose to expedite consummation of federation by all means in their power.5&apos; I foresee that one matter on which we are likely to be pressed in the event of any such arrangement is direct electionfor the Assembly.      It might be necessary to consider some arrangement about that.      But important as that issue is, it isone relatively of minor importance in relation to the majorconsiderations which we have at the moment to weigh,      one possibility,  if it looked like being of material importfmce

i no1   ato make a concession over it, would be given the timenecessary to devise constituencies and prepare an electoralroll, to accept the principle as from second election, butconduct the first election under the scheme of the Act inthe interest of speed.    But I will telegraph separately at greater leisure on this and other aspects.6. Gould you let me have the earliest possible replyto this  (? for)  if there is anything to be said for proceeding on the lines which I suggest  (and I repeat thatcontingent authority to do so might be of utmost value),it is essential that I should know where I stand at once,since these discussions between Congress and Moslems may break up at any time, and I am also anxious to turn toadvantage the presence in Delhi for a couple of dayslonger of Mirza Ismail and Krishnamachari,
