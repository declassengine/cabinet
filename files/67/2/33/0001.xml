COPY no war   CABINET.REPLY TO KING LEOPOLD AND QUEEN WILHELMINA.jfemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. &apos;I circulate to my colleagues herewith a draft reply to be sent to the Queen of the Netherlands andthe King of the Belgians in answer&apos; to their recentarrpea.1.,(Intdo)        H.IfflJ OFFICE.9th November,  1939

ANNEX.1, I have carefully examined, with my Ministers, the appeal which Your Majesty and Her Majesty, the Queen ofHis Majesty the King ofthe Netherlands     addressed to me on November 7th.the B elgians2, I recall the appeal made hy Youy MajestyIlia Majesty &quot;the King_     on August 23rd on behalf of theof the Belgiansrepresentatives of the Oslo Group of States, in whichyon pleaded for the submission of disputes andHis Majestyclaims to open negotiation carried out in the spirit ofbrotherly co-operation,-       My government as well as theFrench Government sent favourable replies to this appealbut the German Government made no reply.3. I recall also the joint offer of mediation made by your Majesty and Her Majesty the Queen, of the NetherlandsHis Majesty the King of the Belgiansto my Government and to the French, German, Italian and polish Governments on August 28ttu    This offer was welcomed by my Government and by the French,    Italian and PolishGovernments, but the German Government1s only response wasto launch an unprovoked attack on Poland, which has been over-run with every circumstance of brutality.4, My Government deeply appreciate the spirit ofYour Majesty&apos;s offer and they would always be willing toexamine a reasonable and assured basis for an equitablepeace.    It is our desire that the war should not livst one day longer than is absolutely necessary, and I thereforehasten to reply to that part of Your Majesty&apos;s appeal inwhich you state your willingness to facilitate theascertaining j! tho ilaments of an agreement to be reached,

honourable peace must be secured have already been announced in broad outline by my Government.     the documents which were published at the beginning of thewar clearly explain its origin and establish theresponsibility for its outbreak.     We took up arms only after every effort had been made to save Peace.6. The immediate occasion of the entry of my country into war was the open German aggression againstPoland which brought into operation our obligations tothat country.     But this aggression was only a freshinstance of the German policy towards her neighbours andthe larger purpose for which my people are now fightingis to secure that Europe may be redeemed &quot;from theperpetually recurring fear of German aggression so as toenable the peoples of Europe to preserve their independence and their liberties&quot;.     These words of thePrime Minister have been amplified and enlarged on anumber of occasions, in particular by him on 12th Octoberin the House of Commons and by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in the House of Lords on 2nd November.7. The elements which in my Governments opinion mustform part of any settlement, emerge clearly and distinctlyfrom these declarations of policy.     Should Your Majestybe able to communicate to me any proposals from germany of such a character as to afford reasonable hope of achieving the purpose I have described above, I can say atonce that my Government would give them their most earnestconsideration.
