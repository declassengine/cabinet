COPY NO.WAR CABINET.ECONOMY OP TONNAGE.PRESENT CAUSES OP DELAYS TO SHIPPING.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Shipping.At the meeting of the Home Policy Committee on the8th November I undertook to circulate a memorandum on the delaysto shipping.Shortage of shipping arises from delays as well as fromhostile action.    Time spent in port or at anchor or movingotherwise than by the shortest sea route to destination is, fromthe point of view of the carrying power of the ship, time lost.(2) Appendix I shows delays now falling on coastal shipping and on shipping in the Short Sea trades engaged in theexport of coal, from convoy arrangements and routeing.(3) Appendix II shows the delays arising in the case offoreign-going shipping from convoy arrangements, routeing andzigzagging.(4) It will be seen from these figures that we are losingthe effective carrying pov/er of our Mercantile Marine to a verrserious extent.    The great advantages of the rapid and successful introduction of the convoy system are thus partly offset.(5) While delays to colliers loading in the Bristol Channelare considerable, those incurred on the East Coast must becrippling if continued.    In the last three weeks of October thetime spent on such voyages to London was double the normal.    Inother words, the carrying capacity of the colliers was halved.The loss of time in voyages to the French ports was practically

0n the same scale and is drastically curtailing.French, importsof coal.    This is serious, as we have to make good by shipments,from this country the coal (about eleven million tons in 1937)which France has been getting from Germany.The same delays affect French and neutral tonnage in this trade.(6) On the long-distance voyages,  the excess has rangedfrom about 15 per cent, to 30 per cent* over normal times,particularly serious are the delays from the Mediterranean.I have urged that a substantial proportion of our iron oreshould be drawn from North Spain, whence at the moment nothing is being drawn, as an alternative to North Africa, but animmediate increase in the frequency of convoys from Gibraltaris in any case of vital importance unless we are to face thefull consequences of a great reduction in our capacity to import many essential commodities from the Mediterranean,India and the East.    There is at present only one convoy a week to, and one from, Gibraltar.(7) Unless something can be done (and I know that this maybe difficult)  to expedite the return of the grain and timbervessels now loading in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,  the Minister ofFood and the Minister of Supply will find that the arrivalswhich they are expecting by the end of the year or thereaboutswill he thrown forward until late in January.    The presentconvoy arrangements from Halifax also involve detention of manyships and could perhaps be reviewed.(3) A further reduction of carrying capacity results fromthe fact that vessels which are delayed, deviate from the direct course and zig -zag, require to carry more coal and thisexcludes car,.o.(9) I urge,  therefore, that it is essential to increasethe frequency of convoys as well as to improve their efficiency and to take the various measures which the First Lord has already-2-

outlined.    I concur with him that there must be the fullestco-operation between naval officers and the Ministry ofShipping, including my representatives and commercial agentsat the various ports of loading and assembly abroad.(10) Other causes of delays to shipping, such as armingwith defensive armament, repairs and the like,  should bevigilantly checked by the appropriate officers of thedepartments concerned and reduced by every possible means.(ll) I need hardly emphasise the effect of the delays uponfreight rates, which have been increased and must be furthersubstantially increased.    Owners&apos; expenses accrue daily andthey cannot be expected to run their ships for many extra dayswithout increased remuneration.(12) Obscuration of Lights.    This cause of delay affectsall shipping working to and from this country or in home waters.Its consequences are felt especially in winter, which is nowupon us and when in any case bad weather affects work in ports in lessening the rapidity of loading and discharge and despatchof shipping.    It impedes the full use of railways and of road traffic at night,  thus aggravating the difficulties of internaldistribution.      This in turn will react upon the rate of movement of cargoes from and to ports and may lead to congestionana delays at the ports of discharge and to a slowing down ofthe rate at which cargo can be got to the ports for shipment andloading..   The obscuration of lights reduces navigation at anumber of important United Kingdom ports to once in 24 hours,and in some ports in winter months there will be many days whenmorning and evening tides fall in hours of darkness, virtuallyclosing the port.(13) The obscuration of lights in shipbuilding yards isalso delaying the shipbuilding programme.(14) East to West Coast Diversion.    The dislocation ofinternal distribution caused by diversion entails delays to shipping as well as to other forms of transport.    To discharge

at west coast ports commodities like ore and timber fordestinations ordinarily supplied from east coast ports is avery serious handicap.    This partly accounts for the veryserious delays to the Narvik ore boats.    It is also important that the shipment of export coal from east coast ports andthe unloading of ore cargoes should not be delayed for lack ofrailway wagons.(15) Contraband Examination.    In this respect, neutral shipping is the chief sufferer, but the immobilization of neutral shipping reduces the volume of tonnage available for transport by sea and has already   affected the ability, or at anyrate the willingness, of certain neutrals to put at our disposalas much tramp tonnage as we hoped for.Delays due to contraband have been the subject of memoranda to the War Cabinet (Minute 11(c), W.M.(39) 54 andW.P.(G)(39)  68) and all that needs to be said on this subject is that the remedial measures which have been proposed shouldbe brought into operation as rapidly as possible.(16) To summarise, the points which seem to me to requireurgent examination are these(a) The lessening of delays due to convoys and theinstitution of more frequent convoys. I know that the First Lord is giving close attention to allpossible measures which can be taken to lessen theloss of time at present suffered, in so far as that can be done consistently with a proper degree of safety.(b) The policy of obscuration of lights should again bere considered from the point of view of lesseningpresent handicaps on work in ports and on transport facilities, especially in west coast and channelportso    The French, I believe, do not consider suchextreme restrictions necessary.

(c) The policy of diversion from east to west should,I think, be reconsidered on the following lines:-(i) The Admiralty and the Air Ministry should beasked to reconsider,  in the light of suchexperience as we now have of war conditions,  towhat extent the dangers to be encountered at East coast ports justify ohe policy of diversion to the west coast,(ii) Generally,  except in face of grave danger, ships should be allowed to dischurge on che east coastwhen their cargoes are such as are definitely &apos;required for east coast destinations.    The sameship should not discharge or load at more thanone port unless this is inevitable and supply departments should recognise this,(iii) Export trade from the east coast which cannot,without radical disturbance, be routed via thewest coast, should be allowed to be shipped onthe east coast.    Ail vessels which are destinedto load outwards from the east coast should beallowed to discharge their inward cargoes onthat coast, provided that the cargoes are suitable for such destinations and arrangements should be made to ensure,  so far as is possible,that vessels which are going to discharge on theEast Ooast should bring to this country cargoesrequired on that coast.J.G.f-RY OP SHIPPING-,!3th November,  1939,
