SECRET. Copy No. j oW.P. (G.) (39) 107.WAR CABINET.AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS.Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I HAVE received the following minutes from the Naval Staff which Ithink it my duty to bring before my colleagues.W. S. C.November 20, 1939.[20339a]

Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1939.SECRET. Copy No. 13W.P. (G.) (39) 107.WAR CABINET.AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS.Minutes.I SUGGEST that the question of air raid precautions abroad might beraised in the War Cabinet with a view to some guidance being given to those onthe spot. As far as I can see, the most unnecessary restrictions are being imposed in many areas, e.g.,1. It is reported that lighting restrictions observed at Gibraltar since thecommencement of the war have resulted in the postponement of the date of completion of the widening of No. 1 dock from December 1939 to June 1940.The Admiralty have taken this up with the Colonial Office and the flag officer Commanding North Atlantic.2.   I understand that at Malta a black-out is in force.3. I hear from private correspondence that at Colombo a black-out isin force.4. I see in this morning&apos;s Times a black-out of the East coast of Africaunder British control has been imposed as a consequence of the appearance of araider in the Mozambique Channel.I would suggest that all these restrictions are completely unnecessary. Inthis country, wher-e we are within range of a large German bomber force, it is arguable that we must continue the black-out, though even here many, includingmyself, consider that it would be much better to let it up unless and until we get hit. Abroad, however, out of the range of the German Air Force, I can see no excuse whatever for putting the community to the inconvenience and delaysto shipping, trade and other activities which must inevitably result from ablack-out.Apart from these reasons, I consider that the effect on morale of all thisblacking out must be very bad indeed, and I should not be surprised if we arethe laughing stock of the world over it. How anybody with any sense of proportion can black out East Africa because raiders appeared in theMozambique Channel I find it difficult to conceive. I suppose the chances of an aircraft from this raider trying to bomb anywhere in East Africa are certainly not more than one in a million.Again, at Malta, Colombo, &amp;c, why should we black out ? We did not doso in the late War, and what possible excuse is there for doing so now ? I suppose that, here again, they must be thinking of a possible raid from aircraft carried in ships.[20339]
No doubt it is very valuable that in all parts of the Empire the black-outdrill should be exercised and people should know what would be required if ablack-out had to be imposed, but, beyond a drill or two, I cannot see the objectof going on with it.I would suggest accordingly that the matter be taken up with those concerned, the true facts in each case should be ascertained, and an attemptmade to instil a sense of proportion into the local authorities.T. s. V. P.(Deputy Chief of Naval Staff).November 18, 1939.i entirely agree.November 18, 1939.D. P.(First Sea Lord).
