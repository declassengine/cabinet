illAddressed to the Right Honourable Neville Chamberlain.Prime Minister.&quot;Unnumbered.      October 28th.     MOST SECRET.My thanks for your message of today through theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.In my opinion the immediate object is to win the war&apos;and to win it in no uncertain way since a patched up andpremature peace would inevitably expose us to a future seriesof events similar to those of the past few years.    But whatcomes after the victory?      I greatly fear that there will be many people who will want to secure peace by suppressing andeven by dismembering Germany or imposing a burden upon herwhich will be almost insupportable.Personally I feel that no doubt such a policy would render a future war inevitable since the Germans are much too great and powerful a people to be kept in subjection and thedesire for revenge would inevitably produce the attempt totake it.The alternative is to follow victory by a great and genuine gesture of generosity and of justice withterritorial adjustments founded not upon the idea of spoils0to the victors but upon real racial and social considerationswith unprejudiced approach to the problems of Colonies and rawmaterialsTelegram from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealthof Australia to the Prime Minister.Dated 29th October,1939.    Received   f p.m. on 29th October.

materials with a new and more practical attempt at some system of collective security.      In any suggested settlement the whole idea would he that Germany would he expected toplay her part as a great nation on a footing of freedomand equality.    In brief I think that the only sound condition for   law abiding international civilization is that kind of equality and self-respect and mutual tolerance whichcharacterises our domestic civilizations.    A post-war period which involved the maintenance of huge repressive armamentsis intolerable to a world which desires social and industrialprogress, and I see no hope for disarmament if the doctrine of suppression is to prevail.    I think that any public statement at this stage should be made with great care, forin the present state of affairs in Europe nothing would bemore fatal than to create the impression that we had adefeatistattitude or that we were not resolutely determined to win.It can do nothing but good if we accompany a vigorousprosecution of the war by a fair-minded statement regardingthe kind of world in which we hope to live when the war hasended in victory.Moreover, those who advocate not merely the defeat butthe destruction of Germany pay far too little attention to theproblems which are and will be presented by Russia, Italy and japan.I have not been able yet to have a discussion with myCabinet but I am sending you these views as those which I personally hold and which I believe commend themselves to mycolleagues.    I have also conveyed them to the other dominion prime Ministers because I feel that the fullest possibleconsultation at this time is of supreme importance.    Ends.

No.8 Secret.Reference to your telegram circular D. No.52.This matter is one of greatest importance both for War and Peace thereafter and I welcome fact that theDominions are being consulted. I trust there will he nohurry in replying to French Government and that Dominionswill have time to givo most careful consideration to thematter.I hope to send our views later.Telegram from the Government of the Union of South Africa.Dated 51st october .
