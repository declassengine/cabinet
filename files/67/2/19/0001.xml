Delays to shipping in the Contraband Control.In accordance with conclusion 11(c) ofthe 5kth conclusions of the War Cabinet of October 20th, Icirculate the accompanying report describing the result ofthe enquiries which I have instituted, in consultation withthe Minister of Shipping, into the delays which have been caused to shipping hy the contraband control measures takenby this country.2.    It will be appreciated in thisconnection that, whereas delays to shipping have undoubtedlyoccurred, they are on the whole a good deal less than might hesupposed from the impression given by interested parties.There is no control whatever of outward bound shipping.Similarly, there is no control whatever over inward boundshipping carrying goods wholly consigned to the UnitedKingdom, or Prance.,    Other inward bound vessels may nothave cargo on hoard which has to come before the ContrabandCommittee.    Statistics show that inward bound shipsPassing through the three Naval Control Bases in theUnited Kingdom,, exclusive of those ships proceeding direct to cth3r ports, amounted to 190 during the week October 1st10 7th inclusive,    in that same period only 67 ships were^Portea to the Ministry of Economic Warfare from theVal Control Bases and other ports for their cases tooro-acht before the Contraband Committee,

3.   Even where there has heen delay, itmust he recognised that the most prolonged detentions havebeen in the case of large mixed cargoes shipped, for example,from the Dutch East Indies, or from the Belgian Congo.,consisting largely of consignments of commodities of thegreatest importance to Germany, and not hearing any indication of their ultimate destination.    I myself feel thatthe Contraband Control Committee were right in not allowingthese large cargoes to proceed without first directing that enquiries should he made regarding the destination of eachimportant consignment.(initialled) R,H,C.November 1st 1939

DELAYS TO SHIPPING IN THE CONTRABAND CONTROLComplaints have &quot;been received from shipping lines and from neutral Governments that their ships have been subjected through the contraband control measures takenin this country to excessive delays, amounting, in some cases to four or five weeks.   They regard it as intolerable thatthe British! authorities concerned should take so long toreach a decision which goods, if any, must be unloaded., inorder that the vessel may be released! and proceed to herdestination.     These complaints are in some cases justified,and it is the purpose of this Paper to set forth thecircumstances in which these very considerable delays have arisen, and to suggest certain measures by which they maybe reduced.2.       At the beginning of a war it is inevitable that serious delays to shipping should occur owing to theoperation of the contraband system.    The delays which tookplace at the beginning of the last war are believed to havebeen no less great, although far fewer ships were brought inin the early days of that war.    Moreover, in that case itmust be remembered that the blockade was organised in an existing Government Department.   A new Ministry cannotbe expected to work with perfect smoothness and efficiencyfrom the first day of war; the staff is inexperienced,people do not know exactly what their f-unctions are orhow they can best be carried out; there is a shortage oftelephones and other office equipment in the new building;typists are not available when required, and so forth.    Itis obvious that a large new organisation cannot in all respectswork/

work smoothly from the date of its establishment.    Thisis recognised hy the shipping lines and hy the neutral governments concerned.3.     Moreover, considerable delays at the outset of a war are inevitable for quite a different reason.The Contraband Control has at first to deal with cargoesloaded &quot;before the war began.    Of these cargoes, a partmay be openly consigned to enemy territory, and can heseized and put in prize without further question.    Manyconsignments, however, will he found to he consigned&quot;to order&quot; in accordance with a normal peace-time practice.Consequently those responsible for contraband control will find themselves obliged to deal with large cargoes, consistingperhaps of several hundred items, about many of which nofurther information is available than that they are consigned&quot;to order, Rotterdam&apos;1&apos;, or &quot;do order, Antwerp&quot;, or perhapswith an optional destination of Antwerp, Rotterdam, Copenhagenand other ports.      It is evidently impossible to know,without detailed enquiry in each case, whether or not theseconsignments, many of which may he of importance, areultimately destined for enemy territory.h.    As the war goes on, these particularcauses of delay should automatically disappear.The new Ministry and its officials will acquireexperience of the work which they have to do, and theday to day handling of actual cases will reveal the many ways in which the procedure can he speeded up.Shipping/

m-3-ghipping lines too will adapt themselves to war conditions;consignments to order will cease, guarantees regarding theultimate destination of goods will he forthcoming, theNavicert system will he put into operation, advance information regarding cargoes will he furnished beforethe ship&apos;s arrival, and, in short, the shipping lines will-operate with the Ministry to a greater and greater extent.These changes are already taking place *5.    The main question now for consideration is what is the cause of the delays which are at presenttaking place and to what extent these can be remedied.It is true, as shown above, that delays are inevitableat first, but a stage has now been reached at which theycan and must be reduced.Delays before the cargo is considered by theContrap and Committee,6.   When a ship is detained at a Contraband ControlBase or in a British port, she is examined by the british authorities concerned, and her manifest, or full particularsregarding her cargo, are sent to the Ministry of economic warfare.    These particulars are then examined in the intelligence Department of the Ministry before being passed to the Prize Department to be laid &quot;before the Contraband Committee.7.    In general, it may be said that little seriousdelay has hitherto taken place at the Contraband ControlSases,    There have been days when the weather was toohad to allow the competent British officials to board a ship on her arrival, but the necessary information has/

- u --Ims- in-^est^as-e^be-en-sjrpi^^ of economic warfare without undue delay.     Nor are there seriouscases of undue delay on the part of the Customs officials at the ports in supplying the information required.8.    There has, however, been very considerable delay in certain cases before the information received in the Ministry of Economic Warfare has been laid beforethe Contraband Committee.      It is not an unusual occurrencefor the details regarding a large mixed cargo only toreach the Contraband Committee some 10, 12 or even 11+ days after the arrival of the ship.    These delays are clearlyexcessive.9.    The delays at this stage are sometimes dueto the fact that the information received from the contraband Bases or ports regarding a cargo has on several occasions not tallied with information furnished by the ship&apos;s agents or by other sources.    In such casesfurther enquiries are clearly necessary to establish the facts.    More usually, however, delays are due to thetime required by the various sections of the Ministry&apos;sIntelligence Department for making enquiries andcommenting on the various consignments.    Copies of the forms containing particulars of a ship&apos;s cargo are sentto the Black List Section for comments regardingconsignees and to the Neutral Countries and StatisticsiSections for comments on the normality of consignments.Each of these sections may take some days to producef-ts comments.    Investigations have shown, however,that where there has been delay it is generally dueto/

tcr^^uffTcrxency of staff and also to a lack of^ualifications in certain officers.    In the case ofthe higher grades it is the insufficiency of numbers which predominates, and in the case of the lower gradesmore a., lack of qua! if modifications for the specialised workof certain sections.10.     Meanwhile, as a temporary measure, it hasbeen arranged that the Prize Department, in preparingtheir cases for the Contraband Committee, should foregothe comments of certain sections of the IntelligenceDepartment o     Although this may result in some items of contraband reaching the enemy which would have been stoppedif all the information available in the IntelligenceDepartment had been tapped, the arrangement seems necessaryto enable arrears to he cleared up -.    As soon as that has been done, however, it will be necessary to revert to theoriginal system whereby all the Intelligence sectionsconcerned are enabled to furnish their comments on cargoreports,    In addition to this temporary expedient, permanent arrangements have heen made to limit the number of items of cargo brought before the Contraband Committee for decision,oy ignoring all those which are relatively unimportant,either intrinsically or in point of quantity, even&quot;though they may he covered hy the Contraband List.    Itroust, however, he recognised that as delays are reduced and the machinery improved, it will he desirable toincrease once again the scope of the material submittedhp the Contraband Committee.I.?$i3y8. due to the policy of -the Contraband Committee.11,    The Contraband Committee, when a case isbought &quot;before them, sometimes feel able to decideforthwith, with the help of tho comments of the^elligence Department, whether a cargo should be released/

released or seized.    In most cases, however, they decide that at least a part of the cargo should he detained forfurther enquiries.     This generally means that the ship is held up while these enquiries are being instituted.12.      It has hitherto been the policy of the contraband Committee to order enquiries to be made regardingnearly every important item where they are not satisfiedregarding ultimate destination.   They do not limit theirenquiries to the cases where they have special cause forsuspicion.    The Contraband Committee take the view thatit is their task to stop all important items of contrabandgoing to Germany, and that if it is necessary for thispurpose to detain every such consignment to a neighbouringneutral while enquiries are made regarding its destination,then it is necessary that these consignments should be detained.    In the case of some large mixed cargoes,consisting of hOO or 500 items, the Contraband Committeehave directed that enquiries should be made, and possiblyguarantees received, in respect of UC, 50 or even 70items.   This necessarily causes delay to shipping.13.    There are one or two special cases in whichthe Contraband Committee have found it necessary toadopt a course which has resulted in additional delay to shipping.    For example, the Netherland Legationrecently guaranteed that a consignment of linseed to holland would not be re-exported to Germany.     the contraband Committee thereupon asked for a furtherguarantee from the Netherland Legation that not onlythe/

-7-linseed, tout- -als-o-the -products of the linseedwould not he re-exported to Germany,     The NetherlandLegation refused to give this further guarantee.The Contraband Committee thereupon decided that theconsignments in question should be detained, and thatit should be suggested to the shipping agents thatthey should be unloaded, and this decision has thereforeresulted in delay to the ships concerned.Delays after the Contraband Committee&apos;s decision,lh..     It is the duty of the Prize Department ofthe Ministry of Economic Warfare to take the action required as the result of the Committee&apos;s decision.In particular, it is incumbent on them to notify these decisions to all concerned and to set on foot the enquiries which the Committee have directed should bemade with regard to the detained items,    After the required information has been obtained, the PrizeDepartment have to arrange for the case to be brought up again before the Contraband Committee, in order thata final decision shall bo reached whether the detainedconsignments should be seized or released.15.     The policy of the Contraband Committee to institute enquiries into the ultimate destinations of nearly every important item in a large mixed cargohas imposed on the Prize Department a volume of work with which they have been unable adequately to deal with&quot;the staff at their disposal.     They have had greatdifficulty in securing the necessary staff, and it hasmow been found necessary, after more than three weeks&apos;unsuccessful efforts to secure our requirements throughthe Central Register set up under the Ministry of Labour,*0 cut the Gordian knot and by private arrangement to select suitable candidates who have afterwards been registered/

gistered with that Ministry.     A staff of&quot;administrative officers has thus at last &quot;been se&amp;used which will besufficient to carry on the necessary work.     In addition,however, to administrative officers, an adequate staff ofclerks and typists is needed and steps are being taken to remedy deficiencies under this head,,   Further increases may prove to be necessary.16.       The enquiries which the Prize Department aredirected to make with regard to the detained items aregenerally made of the shipping agents, of anyone in Londonwho is understood to have information regarding the consignment,or of the British Missions abroad0      In the most difficultcases of large mixed cargoes, where the Contraband Committeehave directed that a large number of enquiries should be made,it is usual to request the shipping agent concerned to producedeclarations against re-export, signed by the consignee in thepresence of a British Consular Officer.There have been some complaints that the letters whichthe shipping agents address to or receive from theircorrespondents abroad, in order to comply with theMinistry&apos;s request for these declarations, are delayedby the censorship0     Arrangements are being made to overcome this difficulty;, hut it may have caused some delay to shipping in the paste17.      In cases where the shipping agents have noinf,Qr.mation.-regarding the consignee, it is sometimesnecessary to telegraph to the British Mission at theport of loading to obtain information from the consignor;when a reply has been received to that telegram a further telegram is sometimes required to another British Missionregarding the consignee,    This cuibrous procedure should/

should &quot;be unneoessaryfnf utur^a*^^&quot;to order&quot; have ceased.18.     It is desirable, when goods are detained for enquiry, that every facility should be given to vessels to unload these goods at a British port if they desire todo so, and to proceed to their destination with the goods whichhave been released.      It is not possible, however, for vessels to unload their detained consignments at any of our contraband control Bases.      It is recommended that in future, shippingagents should be not only permitted, but even encouraged,as soon as the Contraband Committee have decided to detain goods for enquiries to move their ships from the Contraband ControlBase to a port where they can unload the detained items and proceed on their way.19.    The preceding paragraphs deal with the delays to shipping when goods are detained for further enquiry.    Similar delays often arise when goods havebeen seized by order of the Contraband Committee.After seizure has been ordered by the Committee, theAdmiralty Marshal, in consultation with the ShippingDiversion Committee, decider: to which port the vesselshould proceed to unload.     But unloading certain kinds of cargo is not always an easy matter, and there havebeen cases where a ship has been delayed for more than amonth before she has been able to get rid of her seizedcargo.    It will be appreciated that this aspect of thequestion comes within the province not of the Ministry ofEconomic Vtfarfare but of the Admiralty Marshal.Recommendations/

-10-135r^nmmendations.20.        &quot;--&apos;The-f-oi^oi2xg---giyas--a- briefrev-iew-of-thecircumstances which have caused delays to shipping duringthe past few weeks.     It is evident that these delays areexcessive, and must he reduced.     There is reason to believethat they will in any case be reduced before long., as experience teaches all concerned, not only officials butalso shipping lines, to adapt themselves to war conditions.The shipping lines especially can help toreduce delays by arranging to send advance copies ofmanifests to the Ministry of Economic Warfare.     This willin many cases enable the necessary investigations to becarried out before the ship herself arrives.     The shipping lines could further shorten the delay by arranging only tocarry goods for which they had obtained guarantees i.m advance that there would be no re-export of the goods from the country of consignment o21:.     Certain measures have already been taken inthe Ministry of Economic Warfare to reduce the delays whichhave been taking place during the last few weeks.    There are other measures, ego, the introduction of Navicerts, whichwill relieve the situation in the future but which can onlygradually be brought into operation.22.      The following are our recommendations forimmediate action:-(a) By far the most important measure whichcan he taken is to arrange that the Departments of theMinistry of Economic Warfare shall he provided with thestaff which they require at once, and shall he provided with further staff without delay as this becomes necessary.It must he emphasized that most of the delay is due to thefact that there have been far too few administrative officers/

officers &quot;bo do the work and that the approved machineryfor the recruitment of staff through the Ministry of Lahourhas hitherto proved to he ineffective.    If administrative officers are necessary they must he forthcoming, if not from the Ministry of Lahour, then from elsewhere.     Ifshipping clerks or other clerks are required, they mustbe forthcoming, again with the least possible delay.     Itis no exaggeration to say that the failure to supplyadministrative officers and clerks has resultedmindelays which have cost shipping lines sums which areout of all proportion to the salaries of these officials,and it is not unlikely that the shipping lines will putforward claims against His Majesty&apos;s Government inrespect of these delays.     For the future, it is essentialnot to be wholly hound hy the normal procedure which is &apos;considered essential in peace-time.     Conditions arechanging from week to week.     As soon as the Navicertsystem is introduced, more staff may be required in certain sections of the Ministry.     If ever action is taken against enemy exports, it will he necessary to duplicate the staffof the Prize Department and increase that of certain sections of the Intelligence Department at once.     some arrangement must he devised for reducing the present timelag in providing the new staff required.(h)     Delays have been caused hoy only by the factthat the numbers of administrative officers and clerksare inadequate, but also &quot;by the difficulty &amp;fi securing the requisite number of typists at short notice, and ofobtaining the services of sufficiently efficient typistsJ*tjthe rates of pay laid down for this Ministry.     Somearrangements shouT^be--mad.e. for overcoming this difficulty.(c)     Arrangements should he made, perhaps in someoases by the Ministry of Shipping, to encourage ship-owners

-when the C controls  abend - C ommit tee -decides- &quot;lio-detain goods for enquiry, to send their ships to a port to unloadthe detained items, in order that the ships may be free toproceed at once with the remainder of the cargo.(d)       Finally, of course, we should continue to impress on shipping lines the desirability of sendingus advance information, of refusing to accept any shipmentI to order without clue to the consignee, and in generalof co-operating with the Ministry of Economic Warfarenth a view to preventing delays.     In this connectionsteps are being taken to invite the British Chambers ofShipping to circularise their members and associates in-neutral countries as well, as in the Uni^ted-JCdja^pjm,setting out the-reuuireroerJ^ of^Uxe^MLixListry ofEconomic Warfare.
