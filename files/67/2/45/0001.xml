Treatment of&quot; Soviet- - ships - b-y *the...Cont rahandControl authorities.A report was received from H.M. Consul General at3atavia on the 6th November that the Soviet vessel &quot;IvIAJOKOVSKY&quot;had sailed on the 5th November for Odessa via Suez, with a cargo containing contraband.      Hitherto no Soviet vessel hasentered any of our Contraband Control Bases, but this reportindicated that the question of our attitude to Soviet russian respect of the Contraband Control system was shortly tobscome a practical issue.      Subsequently,  however,  it waslearnt that the vessel&apos;s destination was expected to beVladivostock, in which event she would,  of course,  evade our patrols.2. Nevertheless, the issue is only postponed, for at anytime Soviet vessels or other neutral vessels destined forthe Soviet Union may come forward by the Northern route,  theMediterranean route,  or the Pacific route, and be intercepted by our patrols.      They may well contain contraband or suspectedcontraband, and the Committee considers it necessary toreceive guidance as to the policy to be adopted towards them.3- In the normal course of events,  any neutral ship boundtor a European destination and entering a Contraband ControlBase would be subjected to examination.      Should examinationshow that there was on board cargo suspected of having enemydestination, the neutral consignees  (or in some cases theneutral Government) would be asked to furnish guarantees thathe cargo in question would not in fact be re-exported to thenenw or used to release other goods of the same nature forexPort to the enemy.      In the case of a ship destined for a-n Port, the consignee would almost certainly be the&quot;oviet Government,  or an organ of that Government,  and it mayoubted whether that Government,  in view of its presentndly attitude in general, and its expressed attitude/towards

^gj^j^r^^^^^^^^Q^sn^^ &quot;&quot;In .pa-r ticular, would, &quot;beprepared to furnish the necessary guarantees.      Indeed,it may be expected that a request for guarantees would herejected out of hand and that the refusal would he accompaniedby a strong protest which might well affect adverselypolitical relations between H.M.G.  and the Soviet Government.Moreover, if the request for guarantees were refused,  the contraband Committee v/ould have to consider whether actually to seize the cargo, and there is no doubt that the political repercussions of such a seizure would be considerable.[j.. On the other hand if the Committee did not exactguarantees in the case of vessels destined for the soviet union, it would be differentiating in favour of that countryand there is no doubt that such a differentiation would giverise to very considerable difficulties with other countries(including perhaps even Italy) which have more or: less[reluctantly accepted our practice of seeking guarantees in alldoubtful cases.      I admit too that in the case of Italy,  acertain measure of differentiation in her favour is alreadyoemg operated for reasons of policy which are generallymderstood and accepted.5- iiy own view is that, in view of the importance of treating all neutrals  (with the possible exception of Italy)1!1 the same way and of maintaining the full efficacy of our contraband Control, the risk that the detention of a Sovietr other neutral vessel bound for Soviet Russia and theI1 request for guarantees would provoke a violent reaction onIne part of the Soviet Government,  is a risk which must bepaken.6   Tthe likely event of the request for guarantees being&quot;--ted; it would be for the Contraband Committee to institute&quot; enquiries as might be possible in the circumstances of each-iclivijh^-i- case.      Should the enquiries support the presumptiond for/Germany,that  som^or all of the cargo of the ship were destined for

(Initialled)      R. H. 0.November l6th, 1939-Gerinany, I myself feel that the Gontrahand Committeeshould adhere to its principles and order the seizure of the cargo.
