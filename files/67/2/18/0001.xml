C. L12T8 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government copy NO. 13&quot;WAR    CABINET.LIMITATION OP THE IMPORTING CAPACITYOP THE UNITED KINGDOM.Note &quot;by the Minister of Shipping.At their meeting on the 20th October (w.P.(G)  (39) 48) theWar Cabinet agreed that,  in view of the urgent necessity of importing by the end of December at least 850,000 tons of cerealsover and above cereals for which freight had been arranged atthat date, it was essential that the present negotiations forchartering neutral tonnage should be strongly pressed.NEUTRAL TONNAGE.In continuation of my memorandum WhPo(G) (39) 60 on theprogress of negotiations for securing neutral tonnage, I am ableto report that the Shipping Agreement with Sweden, which is to be signed not later than the far Trade Agreement,    is now awaitingformal acceptance on the Swedish side.    Their delegate returned to stockholm for his final authority to conclude on 1st November-Good progress has been made with the Norwegian owners in regard totanker tonnage;    they are maintaining that they have little tramptonnage to spare.    Several Greek ships have heen chartered (thoughthe unwillingness of their crews to trade to belligerent ports isa real obstacle) and it may yet become necessary to apply pressurethrough refusal of bunkers, insurance and charts to those ownerswho will not accept generous terms.    One of the Yugoslavian boatsout of the ten secured is now in service and others will be readyPortly.CEREAL PROGRAMME.not as regards the requirements for cereals,  it was of course,Possible at so late a season of the year to direct or divert-1-

sufficient tonnage to meet the full requirements of the CerealControl Board as to arrivals by the end of the year upon thebasis of a monthly import of 800,000 tons.    While a fewadditional ships may yet be found in positions which will enablethem to arrive in United Kingdom ports by the end of the year,the shortage of arrivals, upon such information as I have, mayamount to 750,000 tons, apart from possible losses.    The Ministry!of Pood are negotiating for 100,000 tons of wheat to be carried    Iin colliers returning from North Prance in exchange for Roumanian!wheat delivered at Marseilles.In accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s wishes,  the licensingcontrol has been exerted drastically to direct tonnage into the cereal programme and strong preference has been given to cerealsover other cargoes.    As much of this tonnage as possible has been concentrated upon the nearer sources of grain supply, andparticularly the St. Lawrence, Eastern Canada, the AtlanticU.S.A. ports and MoroccoP   A substantial amount of tonnage hasalso been sent to the Plate and some to Roumania and South Africa..The British Lines, which are already carrying principally cargorequired by the  supply departments, have been instructed to givefirst preference to grain in the space still available at thoseports where the Cereal Board have supplies.The result is that the tonnage fixed during the last nineweeks is now approximately equivalent to nine weeks&apos;  requirements.At the same time the cereal programme is throwing a heavy strainupon tonnage, and tramp vessels which might have loaded timberor iron ore have been allocated to cereals.NEED FOR CONCENTRATING- TONNAGE ON NEAR SOURCES OP supply the necessity for equipping ships with defensive armamenthas delayed certain vessels which might otherwise have been sentto the St. Lawrence before the close of navigation.    These and

mother delays, attendant upon the institution of convoys, thetemporary closing of the Mediterranean;  the diversion from east Coast ports and other war measures, greatly reduced ourimporting capacity in the early weeks of the war,,    Some of the mare temporary, hut they have heen serious in the aggregate andmust continue to have a dislocating effect upon the distributionof tonnageo    The whole shipping problem has heen aggravated hythe fact that we did not start the war with larger reserves of vital commodities0As soon as I receive the necessary information as to all their current and their long-term reaui.rem.ents of essential commodities from the supply departments., I propose to put beforethe War Cabinet an estimate of the probable importing capacityof our tonnage in relation to the demands likely to be made upon it at successive intervals.Meanwhile, I would draw attention to the importance ofobtaining supplies from nearby sources where that can he done.JoGcMinistry of Shipping,4th November, 1939
