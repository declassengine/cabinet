WAR     CABINET. t0yCOPY NO.   fFOOD RATIONING.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1.     In accordance with War Cabinet Conclusion No. 2 of the 25th October, 1939,I have taken steps to make enquiries as suggested from bodies representativeof various sections of public opinion.2.     A memorandum setting out the basis for these enquiries and a list of the bodies or persons to be consulted was agreed between the Minister of Food,the Secretary of State for Scotland and myself and communicated to thePermanent Secretary to the Treasury for the information of the Prime Minister.3.     The memorandum was as follows:-(l) Information to be given in confidence to representative individualsas to the position x regarding Meat, Bacon, Butter, Sugar, togetherwith the suggested rations which we are reasonably sure to be ableto provide.(2) There are two possible courses:-(a) To leave a commodity without rationing control and rely uponpersuasion to keep purchases within the proper limits.     Thisavoids irksome controls but if unsuccessful leads to hoardingin Sugar and inequitable distribution.(b) To ration from the beginning with the assurance that the supplies available will be divided fairly between all classes of consumersat the cost of the inconvenience v/hich naturally arises whenold methods are changed.(3) Which of these courses do you consider is the wise one for any or all of these commodities?4.     The list of bodies to be consulted will be apparent from the summary oftheir views in paragraph 5.     I ought to make it clear that in the time available oral consultation with individuals is all that has been possible.These individuals have not been able to do more than give their personal views, without taking the directions of the organisations with which they areix See Appendix.1.grjT.&quot; T)OOlIvIBNT IS THE FROPBRTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOV3RNL1ENT.

connected, but I think that in most cases the views so expressed may &quot;beregarded as indicating what would he likely to he the preponderant viewsof the particular organisation.      In certain cases the individuals were consulted in their personal capacity rather than as representative of an organisation.5.     The results of the consultations are as follows:-Industrial Organisations.Sir Falter Citrine (T.U.C ) said that while his Council would not wantrationing to be introduced before it was necessary, the preponderant view he felt sure would be, if the position is that there is a risk of serious shortage, that rationing ought to be introduced without delay.      In regardto working people the one thing more important than anything else was thatthey should be satisfied that there was a fair distribution all round and incase of shortage this could only be achieved by rationing.     He did not thinkthat persuasion would be effective.Sir John Forbes V7atson (British Employers&apos; Confederation) thought that ifthere is any serious risk of shortage, rationing ought to be proceeded with.He did not believe that the method of persuasion could be made sufficientlyeffective.      Inequitable distribution owing to absence of rationing wouldhave most undesirable effects industrially and it would be much better to put up with the irksome features of a rationing system.     He laid great stress,however, on the importance of a clear explanation by the Government, preceding the institution of rationing, that the need for it arises because of the many calls upon shipping for other purposes than the transport of food-stuffs,and net &quot;because of the incompleteness of our command of the seas.Central and Local Government Service.Mr. Day (Chairman of Staff Side of National Whit ley Council) was notavailable for consxiltation.Mr. L.C. Hill (General Secretary, National Association of LocalGovernment Officers, with 120,000 members in Local Authority service throughoutGggat Britain) thought that the only fair way was to adopt rationing from thecommencement.     His occupation is organising people for mutual benefit andhis experience shows that it would take a very long time for persuasion tohave much effect on the selfishness which unfortunately is widespread.2o

Middle Glasses.Mr. C. Featherstone Hammond (Hon. Gen. Secretary, National Citizen1 s Union)said that there is so strong a feeling against the interference with freedom to buy what and where one wishes that it is desirable that rationing should notbe imposed unless absolutely necessary.     Their members would find itdifficult to believe that any present difficulty was more than a temporaryresult of the necessity since the war of distributing stocks throughout thecountry and to transport not being in proper order.     They would understandthat if the situation was sufficiently difficult rationing might be required at a later date, but as the likelihood of withdrawal of rationing was probablyremote, it would be better not to commence rationing if it could possibly be avoided.Another consideration was that three of the items named were perishableand could not therefore be hoarded other than temporarily.     This was a safe guard against hoarding.     Having said the above, they would, of course,realise that circumstances known only to the Government might be such as tooverrule all the considerations they had in mind.Miss Caroline Haslett, (Chairman of the British Federation of business and Professional Women and President of the Women&apos;s Engineering Society) saidthat her Associations covered women of all classes and her opinion was expressed on the basis of what she felt would be the general reaction among all classes.     It would be better to commence rationing at once.      Ifpersuasion only was relied upon the decent people would act fairly but theresult would be that they would be penalised by the large number who would try to get more than their proper share.     Rationing is expected and the electrical Association of Women are preparing a card-for wide distributiongiving advice as to the best use of rations and recipes for the use of substitutes.      Lady Swaythling is taking a close interest in this.Housewives.The Secretary,  (National Federation of Women&apos;s Institutes) in the absenceof the President (Lady Denman) said that Lady Denman&apos;s view would almost certainly be that country women, with whom they were concerned, would not beso much affected by rationing as townswomen as they had in so many cases their01lVtt food resources.     Country women, however, could be relied upon to respondhonestly to any wishes which might be expressed by the Government on.

restrictions in food purchases.     Their chief trouble was sugar forpreserving fruit.     Country women had not hoarded bought food and were not likely to do so./&quot;Note: At a large gathering of leading Baptist women held yesterday,Mrs. Brown informs me that over the teacups the principal topic was rationing.The indications were as follows: -(l) The women seemed to take it for granted that rationing was acertainty for some commodities.(2) They discussed with each other the alternative menus they wereindividually&quot; planning if meat was rationed.(5) They insisted that the queue was the most hateful thing for housewives,not only because of the long waits, but because of its unfairness.(4) The opinion indicated seemed to be crystallized by a woman who said&quot;Rations mean that we all get the same amount&quot;^Social Service Workers.Mr. Shoeten Sack (National Council of Social Service) stated that his council at Headquarters had been so occupied with general proposals forwelfare work during the war that he could not pretend that he had specialinformation upon the possible attitude to rationing.     What he said, however,was that they had had numerous conferences of all their District Officers,male and female, during the last two or three weeks.     The Officers were invited to discuss any matters which seemed to them of pressing interest fromthe v/elfare point of view, and although a very wide field was covered, thequestion of food supplies and rationing was never mentioned.     Mr. Shoeten Sackregarded this as particularly significant in the case of the meetings ofWomen&apos;s Associations under the Chairmanship of Miss Margaret Bondfield.     Hisvie?/ was that it was impossible that the subject should not have been eagerlyietated if it had been a burning one in the minds of the large number of womenrepresented.     He pointed out further that at the Vifomen&apos;s Voluntary services committee meetings, with which his Council were in touch, the subject, as faras he knew, had never been mentioned.His general conclusion was that there was - universal expectation of rationing and that provided it were equally applied and that the amounts involved were not obviously inadequate, it would be accepted without any difficulty.4.

Mr. Mallon (Toynbee Hall) said that (a) imposition of rationing was generally expected, and (b) that it would be accepted with no demur if itwere made clear that it was necessary.Speaking particularly of the East End he said that in the last war the rev/ere two main causes of grievance before the introduction of rationing.     Thefirst was the hardship imposed by waiting in queues and the second, which was even greater, was the knowledge or the belief in the working classes that people who had sufficient money could obtain adequate supplies without having to wait in queues.      In his opinion this state of affairs was,  from the pointof view of the Home Front, the danger point of the last war.      In his view,if the working classes were persuaded that everybody was equally restrictedand that wealth could not obtain concessions and that supplies could beobtained in an orderly manner without inconvenience, rationing would be easily accepted.He made a particular suggestion about butter.     He felt that it was desirable to restrict butter as far as possible to children, young persons and invalids and he suggested that if this could not be done as part of thescheme itself an appeal to all other classes to use margarine should be made.Major Bavin, (Y.M.C.A.)Miss Curwen,  (Y.7AC.A. )Major Bavin and Miss Curwen were seen together.     Their views (which maybe taken as the result of many discussions overheardor reported in the largenumber of clubs belonging to their respective associations all over thecountry) were that the opposition to rationing was caused rather by a fear ofthe unknown than by a dislike of the system itself.      All sorts of rumourshave been circulating as to the amounts that would be available and thearticles that would 7oe covered.      It was believed, for example, that themaximum meat ration would be 24 oz. per head, that margarine was to berationed as well as butter and that the joint ration for margarine and butterwould be 8 oz. per week and there were fears of rationing of other^specified articles.In the view of both Major Bavin and Miss Curwen, the amounts proposed were so much larger than they believed was generally anticipated that thisact alone would go a long way to removing apprehension.      In particular, they^0th felt that the fact that margarine was not controlled was of decisive5.

importance.     They pointed out that, in the case of the 13,000 children with whom they dealt, &quot;bread and margarine was the staple diet for a couple of mealsin the day and that if this could be continued as at present it would go along way to removing the difficulty about butter.      Indeed they pointed outthat in the poorer households butter and margarine were generally mixed.With regard to meat, they both took exception to the money level.     They feltthat it would be much better to state it in terms of weight.     Hiss Curwendrew attention to the case of typists and other girls who earned theirliving and could not return home for midday meals.      In their case a ration of 2% lbs. per week (irrespective of price) might be adequate, particularly if offal was not rationed.      If, however, it was stated in terms of money it certainly would not be adequate.Assuming, however, that 2^ lbs. per head were available, they were bothsatisfied that this plus offal would be so adequate that criticism would bevery little indeed.Speaking in general about the rationing system, they recalled that in thelast war bitter compla.ints had been caused not merely by the queues but bythe belief that rich people could always get adequate supplies.     Theyindicated that there were already signs that some of the grocers were taking advantage of their position and refusing supplies of, say, sugar unless thecustomers were willing to buy other things.     This type of profiteering would effectively be stopped by rationing which for that reason also was to be welcomed.     Speaking of such items as game and luxury foods which would not berationed, Major Bavin said that the working class criticism was not that richpeople would still be able to buy what in any circumstance they could not butthat rich people would have a larger share than theirs in the things that theycould buy.On the subject of whether all four items should be in the list, they were both agreed that butter, bacon and meat must be included.     They both felt,however, that, if sugar was not in the same urgent category as the others, it, would be better to restrict the number of articles to three.     They felti Convinced that hoarding would cease if the public were informed that they: ought to restrain themselves and that there was no immediate fear of a shortag
