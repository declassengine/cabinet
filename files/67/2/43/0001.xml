Since then the Japanese Government have adopted a non-committalattitude in foreign relations. While the Anti-Comintern Pact is obviou-nuaem foreign relations: While the Anti-Comintern Pact obvously 1a deadletter, Japan has not denounced it, and has professedNnany and Italy. On the other hand, there have been ttfawweB to ajtaewMa&quot;&quot;Prove relations with Great Britain and the United States At a11^fowever, emphasis has been laid upon the determination of the Government tobn&quot;g the China incident to a successful conclusion.1070S   [20316]
3.   Germany has in the meantime used her endeavours to obtain a Ru &apos;German-Japanese understanding, and there is some reason to suspect the ^extremists in Japan, who formerly advocated an Anti-Comintern allian^i        i .&quot;&quot; ,    -,i n -.1,1    , .      &quot;&quot;mute, mavthenow be:working for a rapprochement with Russia, with the object of elimmat^British and other foreign influence from China. The conclusion of a truce&quot;1&quot;the 16th September,-which put an end to the fighting on the Outer Mono0i;011border, and negotiations for the demarcation of the frontier in that reoj,11together with the release by both sides of fishing vessels which had been detainon charges of trespass and poaching, are not, however, sufficient in themselves ftjustify the belief that a far-reaching agreement of some kind may result between japan and the U.S.S.R.4. It must be remembered that Russian and Japanese aims in the Far Eastare fundamentally opposed to one another. Japan&apos;s fear of communism and herdistrust of the Soviet Government are deep-rooted and would not easily be over-come. Nor could any political agreement which would allow Japan a free handin China and the removal of Soviet support for that country alter the fact evenif such an agreement were honoured, that Japan would extend, rather thanreduce, the area in which her interests would be likely to come into conflict withthose of the U.S.S.R. From the point of view of the latter, it is difficult to believethat it would be in her interest to contribute to the reduction of Japan&apos;s commit-ments or to the strengthening of a neighbour of whose predatory designs she has had abundant evidence.5. While, therefore, it may well be in the interests of both parties to reducethe tension which has prevailed for many years and to avoid incidents whichachieve no object, the conflict of interest, which is fundamental, and theprofound distrust which each has of the other are calculated to prevent theconclusion of any agreement of a durable nature. Japan will continue to haveher Russian problem and the U.S.S.R. her Japanese problem, even thoughelements in both countries may not be averse from some limited course of concerted action (such as the supply of raw materials to Germany) which might serve toinconvenience or weaken Great Britain. In the meantime, China is satisfiedthat Russian support in her struggle against Japan wall continue, though it isnot clear what price she may have to pay for it.6. Japan&apos;s main preoccupation to-day is the settlement of the Chinaincident. This is probably due in part to the effect which its prolongation is bound to have upon her economy (already in a state scarcely to be described as sound), and in part to her desire to present the Powers with a fait accompliagainst the day when they will be free, on the termination of hostilities inEurope, to turn their attention once more to the Par East.7. For the present, Japan pins her hopes upon the establishment at miearly date of a Central Government under Wang Ching-wei, with which shewill hope to make peace and to which she will accord early recognition. Thesuccess of this venture will depend upon the measure of support accorded tothe new Government by influential Chinese in the various parts of occupiedChina. This, in its turn, will presumably depend upon the extent to which japan is prepared to allow the exercise of real sovereignty by the new regime.Unfortunately for Japan, there is nothing in her history of expansion to showthat she is capable of allowing any real measure of independence or self-govern-ment to the peoples of the territories she has subjugated.8.   Until the new regime has been established and in being for some little time, it will be difficult to determine the extent to which Japan is likely to succeecin her plan.   Until then, she will be unable to rid herself of any of her com-commitments, and she must for some time remain in doubt as to the reactions oother Powers, and, in particular, of the three democracies, to her new. venture.The Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated recently that his rulMoidea was the attainment of Japan&apos;s aims in China in as friendly an internatioiijatmosphere as possible.   This does not necessarily mean that Japan will be eas )diverted from her aims, but it may well be taken to indicate a disinclinationfurther extended foreign adventures.9. Occupied with the difficult problems which lie ahead of her in the s0Ult^&quot;of the China incident, it seems highly unlikely that Japan could venture upon. .
heme of southward expansion, in particular. In the words of His Majesty&apos;s*\ nbassador at Tokyo : &quot; Japan has her hands far too full in China and is tooorehensive of the United States in its present mood to think seriously of any move involving danger to Australia and New Zealand, or to territories in which those Dominions are interested.&quot; The hardening of American opinion has beenevidenced in recent months by the denunciation of the trade treaty and the recentoutspoken speech of the American Ambassador to Japan. The treaty expires onthe 26th January, 1940, and Japan is left in uncertainty whether the UnitedStates will negotiate a new agreement or whether, if her complaints are not met,she will institute some kind of embargo. Although it is impossible to forecast the attitude of the United States Government in any given circumstance, Japancannot assume that their reaction to any act of aggression in the Pacific wouldnot be hostile. As long as Japan remains uncertain of the attitude of the UnitedStates this uncertainty affords a certain measure of security to interests which she might otherwise be tempted to assail. This view is strongly supported by HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington in the attached telegram No. 747 of the10th November.10. There are also other reasons why the Japanese, who are essentiallycautious by nature, will hesitate to extend their attack on foreign interests. our naval dispositions are different from those in the last war, when, owing to the threat of a strong German Fleet, we were forced to hold the great bulk of ourcapital ship strength in home waters. Moreover, there is no war in theMediterranean. The increased mobility of the Fleet is a factor which must havean important influence on the minds of any who contemplate threatening Britishinterests in any quarter of the globe.11. In the event of a German occupation of Holland, there is always thepossibility that Japan might be tempted, either at the instigation of germany or of her own extremists, to make a descent upon the Netherlands East Indies.This possibility, however, is conditioned by the same factors outlined above, whichgovern Japan&apos;s attitude towards an attack on British possessions in the Far East.12. British policy towards Japan has been to endeavour to restore friendly relations and to compose the differences arising out of Japanese action in China,provided that this can be done without injury to China&apos;s vital interests in herstruggle with Japan. By looking for ways of settling the Tientsin quarrel, andby endeavouring to allay Japan&apos;s anxiety over her supplies of essential rawmaterials, which has been aroused by our war effort, progressive improvement inour relations may reasonably be expected. Such readjustments as we may beable to effect must, however, be seen in perspective against the main Japanesepreoccupation in China.13. The conclusion is that Japan will continue to concentrate all her efforts on the solution of the China incident. She will sit on the fence as far as the warin Europe is concerned, keeping her hands free to pick up whatever tradeadvantages it may offer.Foreign Office, November 13, 1939.ANNEX.The Marquess of Lothian to Viscount Halifax. [Received November 11.)(No. 747.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, November 10, 1939.iJJUR telegram No. 716.for A f .6 rS not&apos; 1 think&apos; any particularly strong, feeling in the United states the flUf * u anc* ^ew Zealand, though they are popular as young democracies,govern A^ iat w?uld be taken by the United States in the Pacific would beJamii U1 tne ma^n bv its attitude to Japan and the consequences to America ofagcuns? etxpnnsi0n in the Pacific. The United States has long made up its mindol      interference on the mainland in Asia, but there is widespread popular
resentment against Japan&apos;s war on China and the brutal manner m which it hasbeen conducted, often at the expense of American missions three or four yearsago public opinion in the United States supported the evacuation of the philippines as diminishing their strategic commitments in the Far East andtherefore lessening the risk of war. The upsurge of pacifist public opinionduring the recent neutrality debates has been fundamentally a determination notto be drawn into another war in Europe, to which last time they sent 2 million men. But feeling against Japan is quite likely to demand intensification ofeconomic pressure against Japan, when the question of-a reversal of recentdenunciation of the trade treaty comes before Congress next January, especially as the United States can bring very strong economic pressure against Japanowing to the effect of the war on Japan&apos;s trade with British Commonwealth and europe; if Japan began to expand outside China sea zone, in which hersupremacy was recognised by the Washington treaties, I think there would be a powerful movement to stop her. I do not believe that public opinion would nowstand aside if the independence of the Philippines were challenged.If Japanese action left the Philippines alone and concentrated on british possesions, and Dutch Islands, other than Australia and New Zealand, the reaction of&apos; American public opinion would be far slower. But partly becausethe Central Pacific is now regarded as a kind of American reserve, partly becausethe expansion of Japan overseas would eventually threaten the Monroe Doctrineand partly because a war with Japan would probably not involve sending abroadvast armies of conscripts, I think that long before Japanese action threatenedAustralia or New Zealand, America would be at war. This probability isprobably enhanced by the fact that the army and navy and a great manypublicists, though not yet public opinion, recognise clearly that the present formof American security and the Monroe Doctrine is, in the long, run, just asdependent upon the British as on the American Navy. If the United states is to rely upon Great Britain to prevent totalitarian Europe from entering the atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar and the exits from the North Sea.the United States must themselves underwrite the security of the British empire in the Pacific because they cannot afford the weakening of Great Britain itselfwhich would follow the collapse of her dominions in the Pacific.
