88.COPY NOWAP cabinet.ATR RAID PROTECTION FOR EVACUATED GOvTjRNkENT STAFFS.Report of Civil Defence Committee.1.The Civil Defence Committee has had underconsiderarion the memorandum (Paper No. C.D.C.(39) 21)circulated on the 6th November by the First commissioner of Works, and also the Report (Paper No. CO. 6. (39) U&amp;)of the Chiefs of Staff Committee dated 20th Septemberon the question of air raid protection for evacuatedGovernment staffs.      The Committee submit to the V/war cabinet  the following conclusions and recommendations.2. The areas in which alternative Governmentaccommodation has been found are among those used for the reception of evacuated children, and the standard of air raid precautions measures which has been adopted is lower than in more vulnerable areas.     Thus steel shelters arenot being distributed to the general population in these areas,3. The Chiefs of Staff reported that there should bespecial measures of protection for the alternative accommodation earmarked for the War Cabinet, the various)War Rooms and the like.     Action has been taken to implementthis recommendation.      In regard to the accommodation5    Annex I.j6   Annex II.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special oare may be taken to &quot;&quot;ensure the secrecy of this document.

available for Government Departments generally, the Chiefsof Staff proposed that passive defence schemes should he prepared on the same lines as those for militaryheadquarters in the field in static warfare.      It wassuggested that in preparing such schemes refuges either inslit trenches close to buildings or in cellars should beprovided for all staffs.Ij., If precautions were taken on the scale proposed bythe Chiefs of Staff for all Government staffs in the areareserved for alternative accommodation, they would be farabove the standard of protection obtaining for the general public in these or in other relatively safe areas, and it isapprehended that an acute air raid consciousness would be created among the local communities leading to a demand forprotective measures with the accompanying expense and waste of materials.      An increase in the general standard ofprotection in these areas would involve larger civil defence services, the distribution of steel shelters and of material for reinforcing basements, and a higher standard ofprotection in all factories and business premises.5. It may also be observed that the standard favoured bythe Chiefs of Staff would necessarily involve the use ofconsiderable quantities of timber and steel, and we are advised by the Ministry of Supply that there is a very acute shortage, present and prospective, in the supply of these materials.6. In these circumstances we consider that it would be undesirable to implement the recommendations of the Chiefs ofStaff regarding air raid precautions for evacuatedGovernment staffs, and pending a decision by the War Cabinet,we have advised the First Commissioner to suspend action inthis matter.

7. In Paper No.  C.D.C.(39) 21, the First Commissioner ofWorks sets out certain alternative proposals, which, subjectto amendment in detail, we recommend the iVar Cabinet to adopt.The First Commissioner in his paper refers to an inspectionrecently carried out at Bath and Harrogate which showed thatwith few exceptions shelter accommodation with &quot;standard&quot;lateral protection against bomb splinters and overhead coveragainst incendiary bombs and anti-aircraft shell splinterscould be achieved without much difficulty, either by talcingadvantage of existing accommodation below ground level withinthe building or in adjoining vaults, or by using suitableportions of the ground floor such as corridors or rooms havingwindows which can be protected^     The work to be undertakenwould consist in the main of bricking up or sandbaggingwindows and the provision of additional entrances and exits.8.        We are advised that these proposals will not involvethe use of appreciable quantities of timber and steel, andthat, so far as practicable, brick and concrete (the suppliesof which are easier) will be utilized.9. In view of the considerations set out in paragraph 1+ ithas been suggested that the towns which have been chosen forthe reception of Government staffs should be grouped, from thepoint of view of protection, in tv/o categories:(a) Places like Bath and Harrogate, where staffs arein occupation and where the towns may be Saidto be, either from the nature of the staffsthemselves or from the geographical position,comparatively speaking, targets: and towns,whether staffs are yet in occupation or not,scheduled for the Black Move.(b) Places like Colwyn Bay and Llandudno, whichmight be regarded as not calling for anyprotection other than that which is afforded by the buildings in which the staff ishoused.

11. We accordingly recommend to the v/ar Cabinet:(l) that the recommendations of the Chiefs ofStaff (Paper Ho. 0.0.3.(39) k&amp;) relatingto the air raid protection of evacuatedGovernment staffs (other than v/ar Rooms etc.which have already been dealt with) shouldnot be proceeded with.(2) that approval should be given to the proposals outlined in Paper Ho, CD. 0,(39) 21, subject as follows:&apos;-(a) that,  in implementing the policy, theOffice of works should proceedunobtrusively and should pay due regardto local air raid precautions standards.(b) that,  in order to secure reasonableconformity with local practice, theOffice of Works should work in close consultation with the Air RaidPrecautions Department of the Ministryof Home Security.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeJOHN ANDERSON.Chairman.richmond Terrace , S.W.1.,2^th November, 1939.Government staffs should have regard to the local standardin each case.     We are satisfied that any substantialdeparture from the local standard will expose theGovernment to criticism.      In providing splinterproofprotection and overhead cover for shelters, the Office ofWorks should bear this consideration in mindT

p.C.(39) 2U?annex i,v;ar cabinet.civil defence committee.air raid protection for evacuatedgovernment staffs.Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.As soon as buildings in the Provinces wererequisitioned for the use of evacuated Government departments the question arose as to the extent of the a.r.P. measureswhich should be provided in them.      There was a certaindivergence of view in the matter, and the question wasremitted to the Chiefs of Staff for their opinion on18th September.      They reported on 24th September (PaperNo. ccs. (39) 48), and the gist of the report is that,while there should be special measures of protection inregard to the War Cabinet Headquarters, War Rooms, and the like,  &quot;passive defence schemes for all Government departments should be prepared on the same lines as those of militaryheadquarters in the field in static warfare.&quot;     It was addedthat,  in preparing such schemes &quot;refuges either in slittrenches close to buildings or in cellars should be providedfor all staffs ...&quot;     The War Rooms etc. were thereupon.dealt with and are near completion.2. The areas in which the alternative Governmentaccommodation has been chosen are amongst those denominated&quot;safe&quot; from the point of view of the reception of evacuatedchildren and from the point of view of the standard of

A.R.P. measures for the local communities.      Thus steelshelters are not being distributed in these areas.      Ifprecautions were applied on the scale prescribed, by theChiefs of Staff for all Government staffs in these areas,they would be far above the standard of protectionobtaining for the general public either in these or anyother &quot;safe&quot; areas:    and it is apprehended that an acuteair-raid consciousness would be created among the localcommunities, with the accompanying expense and waste ofmaterials,,      In order to avoid this it has been suggestedthat the standard of protection for Government staffs should not be markedly above the level which prevails ineach locality for the local community03. An inspection has recently been carried out at Bathand at Harrogate, to which places numerous staffs havealready been moved, to see what could be done on theselines.      It was found that, with few exceptions shelteraccommodation with &quot;standard&quot; lateral protection againstbomb splinters and overhead cover against incendiary bombs and anti-aircraft shell splinters can be achieved without much difficulty, either by taking advantage of existingaccommodation below ground level within the building orin adjoining vaults, or by sheltering in suitable portions of the ground floor such as corridors    or rooms havingwindows which can be protected.      The work to be undertakenwould consist in the main of bricking up or sandbaggingwindows and the provision of additional entrances and exits.In the light of that inspection it was considered that,having regard to the geographical position of the towns,the wide distribution of the staffs throiighout the townsand their suburbs, and also the dispersal in the buildingsthemselves, protection on the lines of the above would ingeneral prove satisfactory.

4. It has further been proposed that the towns whichhave been chosen for the reception of Government staffs should be grouped in three categories:(a) Places like Bath and Harrogate, where staffsare in occupation and where the towns may besaid to be, either from the nature of the staffsthemselves or from the geographical position,comparatively speaking,  targets.      To suchtowns protection on the scale outlined inParagraph 3 would apply.(b) The towns scheduled for the Black hove, wherestaffs are nor in occupation,      Here a certainamount of bricking up might be done in thebuildings, but measures such as sandbaggingwould not be taken until the staffs are likelyto occupy the buildings,(c) Places like Colwyn Bay and Llandudno, whichmight be regarded as not calling for anyprotection other than that which is afforded by the buildings in.which the staff is housed.5. The scale of protection now proposed, which in thecase of (a) and (b) would be better than that obtainingin the respective local communities, differs from that suggested by the Chiefs of Staff mainly in that it makes no provision against the possibility of the collapse ofany part of the buildings in question as the result ofblast due to a nearby explosion,,      In places whereprotection is afforded it is not on the scale suggested:and in some places there would be no special provision ofprotection at all.      Apart from the wider considerationsas to the reaction on the local communities, on the civil

evacuation scheme, on the opening of schools in reception areas, and so forth, which the extent of protection afforded hy Government to its own staffs in these placeswill provoke, the difference in cost between providingprotection for all staffs on the scale prescribed by theChiefs of Staff and of providing protection to the extentoutlined in Paragraph 4 would be, at the least, more thandouble.(Intld.)

Annex ii.war    cabinet.chiefs of staff committee.AIR DEFENCE OF GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AFTER evacuation from LONDON.REPORT.1. We haye been asked for our views on the air defence of Government Departments after evacuation from london.2. An outstanding feature of the campaign in poland was the way in which the Polish Military headquarters and also their seat of Government were identified and effectively bombed.      This is in accordance with the doctrine laid down in the German War Manuals which placeGovernment and Military Headquarters high on the list of vital objectives.3. It is quite possible that at some time Germany may decide to adopt a similar policy in respect of this,country, particularly if &apos;an(i when she were able to \establish temporarily a considerable measure of air superiority over Great Britain,

Active Defence Measures.llf After evacuation our Government Departments willbe widely dispersed in the West and North West ofEngland and will mainly lie behind the general defence system of this country.      These factors alone will ensure a considerable measure of protection from air attack.5. In spite of secrecy precautions however the generalevacuation area for Government Departments is alreadywidely lenovm in England, and in due course, whenevacuation has taken place, more exact information will no doubt reach the enemy through neutral sources.6. We consider therefore, particularly in viewof the contingency referred to in paragraph 3* that some further precautions are desirable, especially in regardto the War Cabinet Headquarters, and the operationalstaffs of the defence Services and the Ministry of home security.     We think that these should be classified asvital points and the possibility of their defence againstlow flying attack should be examined by the Military andAir Staffs responsible for Home Defence,  though werealise that dispersion makes the special provision -bfactive defences more difficult.Passive Defence Measures.7. We recommend that passive defence schemes forall Government Departments should be prepared on the same lines as those of Military Headquarters in the field instatic warfare.

In preparing these schemes, the following principles should &quot;be observed:-(i) Dispersal.      This is already provided for by the sites selected.(ii) Splinterproof protection of personnel and offices.Refuges either in slit trenches close to buildings or in cellars, should be provided forall staffs.      Splinterproof protection by outsidetraverse and sandbagging should be given toground-floors of buildings, in which should be accomodated personnel required to continue work during raids, i.e. essential operational and war Room staffs and communication personnel,(iii) Camouflage.      Temporary huts built to supplementexisting buildings should be concealed as far aspossible under trees and irregularly disposed.Any other camouflage possible should be carriedout by the Office of Works in collaboration withthe. experts of the Ministry of Home Security.(iv) Traffic Control.      To avoid large concentrations of vehicles near country houses which wouldbetray the presence of an important headquarters,car parks should be kept at a distance from thebuilding and should be dispersed under trees.Adequate police must be provided for this purpose and strict traffic discipline enforced withinthe area.8. We recommend that splinterproofing, provision ofrefuges and camouflage should be put in hand as a matterof urgency for all Departments.      If these measures

cannot be provided for all G-overnraent Departments-^the same time, we recommend that priority should begiven to the essential staffs of those Departmentsconcerned with the immediate conduct of operations, i.e.the War Cabinet, Service Ministries and the Ministryof Home Security.    Telephone Exchanges and War Roomand operational staffs ought to be located on theground floor or in a basement if available&apos;.    if required by the Office of Works, Military labour canbe provided for essential requirements.9. We also recommend that suitably experiencedofficers should be selected to supervise the lay-o\it ofany additional accommodation which may have to beprovided (e.g. huts) with a view to ensuring that due consideration is given to the requirements of camouflage.Under their direction also control should be exercised over the preparation of tracks to and from each .headquarters.10*       We must emphasise that a full measure ofprotection can be obtained from passive defence measuresonly if the schemes are rehearsed in every detail byall the staff.(Signed)    R.E.C.PEIRSE.D.C.A.S.
