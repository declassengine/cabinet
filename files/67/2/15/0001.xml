SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (39) 64.WAR CABINET.NOTE BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a paper which has been preparedby the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty upon the calling-up of skilled workers engaged in the construction of the most urgently neededvessels on the seas. It will be seen that the numbers are extremely small there being 7,000 only in the twenty-four firms and in the Royal Dockyardsand 16,000 in the 300 firms; moreover, the War Office will be deprived of theservices of only 4,000 of these 16,000 men at any one time and then only forthree to four months. Considering that the War Office have already far more men at their disposal than they can train and arm, and can alwaysease themselves in their difficulties by making an additional age-group liableto military service, it is not seen how at this stage in the war the exemptionsrequested would be an injury to the growth and development of the army.It may be that later on a &quot; comb-out &apos;&apos; will be required from all munition works; but surely not until the great masses of volunteers, potentialconscripts and semi-trained recruits have been effectively incorporated inthe army.W. S. C.November 1, 1939.r20236]

SECRET. Copy No.LABOUR  AND  PRODUCTION.Wlemorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary of the Admiralty.I DESIRE to draw attention to the serious position in which AdmiraltyContractors are placed by the operation of the National Service (Armed Forces)Act.It will be appreciated that the Admiralty are straining every nerve to com-plete the contruction of capital ships of earlier programmes and smaller huntingcraft. A few key firms are almost exclusively engaged in the work of ship con-struction and in the manufacture of guns, gun-mountings, and fire-control gear.Owing to a number of factors, the black-out, the difficulty of working nightshifts, and the shortage of skilled labour, our Contractors have informed theAdmiralty that delays of many months must be accepted in the fulfilment oftheir contracts. The Admiralty is now informed by these key firms that thewithdrawal for military service of skilled and semi-skilled men within the age groups will result in a further delay of many months.This serious position cannot be accepted.The approval of the War Cabinet is, therefore, sought for two proposalswhich will go some way to remedying this state of affairs.(1) Complete exemption from military service for at least a year is sought for the skilled and semi-skilled men of some 24 key firms out of the 6,000 onthe Admiralty List. These firms are exclusively engaged on building or equippingwarships that can be completed by the end of 1940. In addition, it is desired tosecure a similar exemption for the Royal Dockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport,Chatham, Sheerness and Rosyth, and other Admiralty Establishments vital forthe maintenance of the Fleet.It is estimated that there are just over 5,000 skilled and semi-skilled men inthese 24 firms and just over 2,000 in the Royal Dockyards within the age groups 20, 21, 22 and 23, which age groups will probably all have been called upby the 1st November, 1940.It is suggested that the War Office should find the equivalent of the,000 craftsmen reserved for the Admiralty either from volunteers or from men called up in the age groups from firms not exclusively engaged in vitalGovernment work.Unless exemption of this nature is secured, delays of 6 months in thecompletion of the 1940 Naval Programme are to be expected.(2) In addition, we should postpone the calling up of skilled and semi-skilledcraftsmen within their age groups in respect of a selected list of some 300 firms,which are mainly or wholly engaged on Government work, including importantAdmiralty work. Great care has been taken in choosing from the thousands of firms with whom contracts are placed by the Admiralty to make sure that onlykey firms are included in this list.It is estimated that there will be at a maximum 16,000 skilled and semi-skilled men employed in these firms of ages 20, 21, 22 and 23. Let it be assumed that there are 4,000 of such men in each age group. It is understood that it isthe intention of the Ministry of Labour to spread the calling up of each age groupover three to four months, making a beginning with the &apos;&apos; twenty-ones &apos;&apos; earlyin December and ending with the &quot; twenty-threes &quot; in November 1940.The Admiral have been in touch with the Ministry of Labour, and have proposed that these skilled and semi-skilled craftsmen in the 300 firms shouldhe the last to be called up in each age group. It is understood that the Minister ofLabour is consulting the Engineering Unions concerned on this proposal.This method of postponed calling up of men in a limited number of selectedfirms will reserve to these firms for three or four months the services of much[20236]
2needed craftsmen, and at the same time the needs of the War Office can be met from volunteers or by taking within the same age group craftsmen from firms engaged on non-Government work.The matter is exceedingly urgent. It is understood that, durmg the courseof the next week, the remainder of the 200,000 militiamen will be called up, anda start will be made by calling up &quot; the twenties &quot; of all those m industry whowere registered on the 1st October last.
