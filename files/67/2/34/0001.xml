Note by the Lord Privy Seal.At their Meeting this morning the Home PolicyCommittee had &quot;before them memoranda &quot;by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister of Pood(Papers Nos. H.P..C. (39) 93 and 94 respectively) on thesubject of Livestock Control.I circulate herewith for the consideration ofthe War Cabinet at their Meeting tomorrow, Saturday morning, the Conclusions reached by the Committee onthis subject and draw attention to the Committee&apos;srecommendations which will be found on page ^ of theConclusionsoS. H.ond Terrace, S0W01. ,10th November, 1939.

The Committee had he fore them- two&quot; memoranda on theeuestion of livestock control, hy  the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland(Paper H.PeC0 (59)93), and hy the Minister of Food (paper.?aC (59)94)  respectively,The memoranda recommended (l)  that authority shouldbe given to the Ministry of Food (a)  to institute at theearliest possible date a scheme of livestock control includ-ing the concentration of slaughtering in certain selectedslaughter houses,  (h)  to purchase livestock as from the date on which the scheme is operated from farmers at prices whichhave been agreed with the Agricultural Departments and theTreasury, and (2)  that an immediate announcement should bemade to this effect0THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE explained that thepresent system of partial control of livestock marketingunder Maximum Price Orders made by the Minister of Pood wasthat all sales of fat cattle,  calves, and sheep for slaughterare required to he made through livestock markets,, and.direct sales of such animals off the farm are prohibited(.Stock for which the scheduled maximum prices are offeredis allocated to buyers on the basis of their normalpurchases in the market,,       This system was never intended tobe more than an interim arrangement pending the introductionof full control, and it was rapidly breaking downc      the urgency of the position was due to two main causes0       First,farmers believing that buying at a guaranteed price was linked with rationing, knew that the Government had gone back on itsproposal to institute meat rationing, and therefore believedthat the Government were going back on the question of guaranteed prices0      Secondly, there was a shortage of animal feeding stuffsc     As a result the markets were flooded, theposition was becoming fantastic, and it was impossible tohold the position for more than three or four dayse      If

confidence could &quot;be &quot;brought hack hy the Governmentbecoming the buyer and also by a reassuring statement(which could be made) with regard to feeding stuffs forcattle, he thought it would be possible to control thesituation.     At the present time    &quot;black&quot; markets werebeing created and there was widespread evasion of theexisting orders to the detriment of the honest farmer andbutcher.     As an instance of the chaotic conditions, hecited the case of one district in which -where normally five or six cows were killed in a week, one hundred and tv/entyhad been slaughtered, 50 to 60% of which were in calf.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that hewas in complete agreement with the Minister of Agriculture.The evasion of the existing orders was very serious inScotland and it should be stopped.      One of the effects of evasion was that farmers who evaded the orders gothigher prices for inferior beasts, whereas the honestfanner was penalized.THE MINISTER OP POOD said that he was in entire agreement with the Minister of Agriculture and theSecretary   of State for Scotland as to the action required,and that an announcement should be made forthwith.     Hewas not, however, in agreement on two points, (l) that theMinister of Pood should be placed in the position of having to   buy the cattle without the necessary Control Scheme to effect their disposal,  (2) that the announcement should include a schedule b  prices.After discussion, it became clear that the Committeegenerally agreed with the re commendations put forward in paper H.P.C.(59)93 and Paper H.P.C. (39)94 subject to twocgialifications, first, as to the inclusion in theannouncement of a schedule of prices, and secondly as to thenecessity for the immediate concentration of slaughteringinto the selected Slaughter houses.      The Committee&apos;sreview may be summarised as follows -

In paragraph 9 of Paper No. H*P.C.  (39) 93 theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretaryof State for Scotland urged that the announcement of theproposals should include a statement of the prices tobe paid for fat cattle.     The sheep prices had alreadybeen announced and the proposed cattle prices had beendiscussed with the producers&apos; representatives, and subjectto some reservations on the part of Scottish producers,were generally acceptable to them.      The Minister of food in paragraph 7 of his Memorandum (Paper No0 H.P.C.  (39) 94)while agreeing that the proposals should be announcedforthwith dissented from the suggestion that the publishedstatement should include a schedule of prices as he was advised that the effect of this would be to induce farmers to hold up sending fat stock to markets until the timewhen the scheme of control became operative and the higher prices payable thereunder became available.In the course of discussion the Committee were informed by the MINISTER OP FOOD that it was estimatedthat it would take about four weeks to get the controlscheme into full operation.     He was most anxious toavoid any hold-up of home supplies during that periodwhile at the same time stopping the present rot which wasflooding the market and depressing prices.     He was prepared to go as far as possible but he feared that theeffect of an immediate announcement of a schedule ofprices to operate in say a month&apos;s time, which prices were much more favourable to the farmer than the prices he was now receiving, would be to cause farmers to withhold theirstock from the market.

On the other hand fears were expressed at the prospective delay of 4 weeks in bringing the control into full effect.     This would bring us close up to the christmas tradec     Publication of a schedule of prices would stop the present flood of selling but would notcause farmers to hold off the market as they would be anxious for various reasons to market their &apos;ripe&apos;  stock.A statement explanatory of the scheme of control without reference to the schedule of prices would fail to inspirethe farmers with confidence that the Government wouldimplement the agreed price arrangements and would have little or no effect in stemming the present flood ofIselling.The Minister of Pood suggested that this aspect of the problem needed further examination and proposedthat the form of the statement to be published and thequestion whether the statement should or should not include the schedule of prices should be further consideredby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury and himself.     Only in the event of failure to reach agreement should the question be referred back to the Committee.The Committee adopted this proposal.hter- The proposal was that in place of the 15,000, or16,000 slaughter houses at present used by a correspondingnumber of butchers , there should be operated some 600of the best, or most conveniently situated slaughterhouses.    The area to be supplied from the selectedslaughter houses would cover the whole of the UnitedKingdom with the exopetion of certain sparsely populated areas.    This system of selected slaughter

2*5 9houses had not heen introduced during the last War andthe lack of control over a vast number of slaughter houses,the great majority of which were small and onlyoccasionally used, led to innumerable abuses; illicitslaughter for the benefit of the owners of the slaughterhouses, and the loss   of meat and offals for rationingpurposes.In favour of the proposal, it was urged that itwould be administratively most difficult, if not impossible to exercise effective control over some 16&quot;,000slaughter houses; that with this number of slaughterhouses there was bound to be a &quot;black&quot; market, highlydetrimental to honest farmers and butchers, and that there        Lv/ould be so great an outcry that the Government would be forced at a later stage to shut down the redundantslaughter houses, and would then be criticised for not having foreseen the situation and guarded against it.It was important to note that the number of selectedslaughter houses (600) had been agreed with the NationalFederation of Butcher^ Associations, which was satisfiedas to the adequacy of this number. It could not beaccurately said that we were &quot;putting people out ofbusiness&quot; as they would still be able to sell meat.Speaking generally, the cattle would be slaughtered by thesame persons who slaughtered them at present, but theslaughtering v/ould be done in the 600 selected slaughterhouses.The scheme itself had heen very carefully preparedby Sir Francis Boys, who had heen Meat Controller in theGreat War, and was the greatest expert on the subject inthis country.    He was absolutely satisfied that the controlscheme could not work satisfactorily unless the number of slaughter houses was reduced as now proposed.

On the other hand, while it was fully-recognised that this proposal   would result in muchgreater efficeincy in administration, and would haveother substantial practical advantages, it was feared that the political reactions to its adoption might heserious.    There were&apos; already many complaints from members of Parliament and others, and while inpractice, no doubt the proposal would not put peopleout of business, it would undoubtedly/ be represented that it would have this effect,,In these eir cumstances it was suggested thatit might be preferable to start by using the whole,or a large proportion of the 16,000 slaughter houses, andthen gradually to reduce the number by stages.Alternatively, it might be possible to add to the list ofthe 600 selected slaughter houses other slaughterhouses including those only occasionally used, whereit could be conclusively demonstrated that these wererecruired to meet the needs of the area in which theywere situated.While there was considerable support for theview that it would have been preferable, on political grounds that the scheme should have been started on one or other of these alternative methods, it was realised that in this matter the views of the ministers most concerned in the administration of the scheme should prevail, and it was accordingly agreed toaccept the proposals in regard to slaughter houses setout in paragraph 5 of Paper No, H.P.0.(39) 9k, on theunderstanding that the Ministers concerned would arrange that the proposal should he presented in thePress and elsewhere in the most favourable light.

(i) That the Ministry of food should be authorised to institute at the earliestpossible date the schemeof livestock controls which includes the concentration of slaughter-ing in certain selectedslaughter houses0(ii) That the Minister   of food should take into account the views expressed duringthe discussion as to thepossibility of starting thescheme on less drastic lines.(iii) that as from the date onwhich the scheme isoperated,, the Ministry ofFood should be authorisedto purchase livestock from farmers in the manner des-cribed in Paper H.P.0.(39)94at prices agreed with theAgricultural departments and the Treasury.(3) That in view of the great urgency of the matter9 War cabinet should be invited to consider theCommittee&apos;s recommendations ifpossible at their meeting on Satur-days 11th Novembers 19399 and thatfor this purposes the Minutes ofthe present meeting of the Committeeshould be circulated to the WarCabinet as soon as practicable.(l) to request the Minister of Foodsthe Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,, The Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury toconfer generally in regard to thestatement to he made as to theproposals as a whole, and inparticular as to the questionwhether the schedule of prices should he included in thestatement or note      Only in theevent of disagreement, shouldthe matter again be brought before the Committee.(2) subject to (1) above9  to recommend the War Cabinet to approve thefollowing proposals respectinglive stock controls-
