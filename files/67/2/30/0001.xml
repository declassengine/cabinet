document IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.WAR CABINET.EIRE:    TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP OFTHE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH.MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD chancellor and THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN.I.1.We have &quot;been asked to prepare a memorandum settin,out the legal and constitutional issues involved in thetermination of Eire&apos;s membership of the BritishCommonwealth.     It is convenient first to consider on what grounds, if any, Eire could be excluded from theCommonwealth, and by what means.2. There have been at least three occasions in recentyears when other members of the British Commonwealth ofNations could have raised questions with regard to the relation of the Government of Eire to the Commonwealth,as the result of legislation which appeared to be inconsistent with the status and position of a Dominionas laid down in the Declaration at the Imperial Conferenceof 1926.      Such occasions arose on the passing of theIrish Nationality and Citizenship Act in 1935, theExecutive Authority External Relations Act of 1936, andthe enactment of the new Constitution which came intooperation on the 29th December, 1937.     It is unnecessary to detail the attitude adopted on ^ach of these occasions.Undoubtedly each of them could have been treated,according to the point of view, either as a unilateral

and unwarranted alteration in Eire!s status as a Dominionor as a reasonable development of her constitutional position.     On each occasion long and anxious consideration was given to the consequences of the legislation in question.On the last of the three occasions, namely on the cominginto force of the new Constitution, a statement was made byHis Majesty&apos;s United Kingdom Government in the following terms:&quot;His Ma jestyhse Government in the United kingdom have considered the position created by the newConstitution which was approved by the Parliament ofthe Irish Free State in June, 1937, and came intoforce on December 29th,     They are prepared to treat the new Constitution as not effecting a fundamentalalteration in the position of the Irish Free State,in future to be described Tinder the new constitution as S-Eire,f or &quot;Ireland&apos;1&apos;, as a member of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations0His Majesty5s Government in the United kingdom have ascertained that His Majesty7s Governments inCanada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New zealand and the Union of South Africa are also^prepared soto treat the new Coiiectitutiona&quot;3. Mr. de Valera;s attitude has been consistentlyequivocal.      He seems to be aware of the grave consequences for Eire if Eire secedes from the Commonwealth.      He ismoreover probably relaictant to cut Sire., off from the UnitedKingdom and the rest of the Commonwealth, with whose generaloutlook and ideals he is in sympathy0      On the other hand,he has repeatedly expressed the view that, so far as he isconcerned,full and loyal co-operation is out of the question as long as partition continues.     Meanwhile he has yieldedeither.to his own inclinations or to his extremists in passinglegislation which has removed almost, but not quite, thewhole of the marks of membership of the British Commonwealth.&apos;4.        The declaration of neutrality in the present war,coupled with the maintenance ?  diplomatic relations withGermany, again raises in its most serious form the question

whether the attitude of the Government of Sire is consistent with the position of a Dominion,, and withmembership of the British Commonwealth of Nations.Undoubtedly there are legal and constitutional grounds onwhich it could be maintained that it is inconsistent withthe position as formulated in 1926.     Allegiance to theCrown has been whittled down almost until it can scarcelybe said to exist.     Every effort has been made to get rid of British citizenship.      In the present emergency Eire&apos;sprofessed neutrality and maintenance of diplomatic relationswith Germany are difficult to reconcile with the ideas ofco-operation and common allegiance to the Crown, both ofwhich are distinguishing features of membership of theCommonwealth.     Yet all the time there has been in fact moreco-operation than is generally known outside Governmentcircles, of which the censorship arrangements may be citedas a recent example.5. It seems almost certain that Eire&apos;s policy is basedon a desire to stay inside the Commonwealth, whilerepudiating the Dominion status and doing everything possibleto mark the dissatisfaction of Eire with partition.      Inthese circumstances, it would be necessary either formally to expel her or not to regard her neutrality as ground forher expulsion.      The grounds upon which expulsion could now take place could only be the neutrality of Eire and hergeneral attitude in the present war, as illustrated by the refusal of the use of the Ports, either taken alone ortaken together with the legislation mentioned above.6. There are, however, two matters of importance to beconsidered in this connection.      The first arises out ofthe action taken by other Dominions and the attitude of this

country towards it.     The declaration of war hy thiscountry was not regarded as creating automatically a stateof &quot;belligerency between the Dominions and Germany.     Theirrespective Parliaments and Governments came to their owndecisions, which were welcomed and acclaimed in thiscountry -as-their own decisions.     Having regard to theterms of the Declaration of 1926, it would have been impossible politicalXy to adopt any other attitude..     Itwould not, we think, be right to regard it as conclusivefrom the legal aspect on the further question, whether a dominion which decided on neutrality could maintain thatneutrality, at any rate on ordinary recognised principles,and still remain a member of the Commonwealth.     It hashowever a very important bearing on the question which weare considering, which cannot be determined solely byconstitutional and legal principles laid down in the past,but has to take account of the political developments whichhave taken place in the relationship between, this countryand the Dominions.7. The second matter arises*from the principle, nowclearly established, that matters of common concern shouldbe the subject of consultation and agreement with othermembers of the Commonwealth.     A question as to whethercertain action is, or is not, consistent with continued membership of the Commonwealth is clearly one of concern to all its members.      It might be said that this principleequally applies to Eire&apos;s declaration of neutrality,and it must be recognised that Eire has frequentlydisregarded the principle enunciated at the beginning ofthis paragraph.     However, the Government of this

country would &quot;be flouting a guiding principle of theCommonwealth relation which it has always sought to upholdif it raised this issue in any form with Eire without prior consultation with the other Dominions, and as aresult of agreement with thern, as to the joint course toadopted,,     If it was decided to undertake such consultation,we could elaborate the legal and constitutional arguments which would fall to be considered,,     Although no greatreliance could be placed on the matters referred to inthe first paragraph of this Opinion, having regard to theattitude adopted,  they would have some relevance in considering the present circumstanceso     The uncertainoutcome of any such consultation must make the p^ospeetof a prolonged discussion very unattractive, but wehave no hesitation in forming the opinion that without such consultation, followed by the assent of the otherDominions, Eire could not be expelledo     The United kingdom could, of course, purport to expel Eire without consultation;    but if the other Dominions disagreed, suchaction might imperil the existence of the wholeC ommo west al th 0Ho8. It is next necessary to. examine the position under international Law, if Eire ceased to be a member of theCommonwealths,     The question that arises here may be putin this waye     Would Germany, if she so chose, be in anybetter position under International Law to enforce astricter neutrality on Eire if Eire was no longer a memberof the British Commonwealth under the Crown?     This is a difficult and perhaps an academic question.     The autonomyof the Dominions as separate States is recognised by  their

separate membership of the League of Nations, and in otherways.     On the other hand, they all act in foreign relations for manor purposes through the Crownc     Arguments1could undoubtedly be found by a belligerent for refusing to recognise the assumed neutrality of a Dominion,,     Thequestion is academic in this sense;    that if Germany made it clear that she would regard Eire as at war with her.,unless she severed her connection with the United Kingdomwithin the Commonwealth, the question whether this was represented by Germany as automatically following from theaction taken by this country and the other Dominions, orwhether it followed from Germany&apos;s own act, would not seem to matterg     As things are to-day, Germany probably prefersnot to treat Eire as a belligerent on our side, notwithstanding the assistance which we may get from Eire in some directions.If, on the other hand, Eire ceased to be a member of the Common-wealth as a result of action taken by the United KingdomGovernment to expel her, Germany would, in our opinion, have agreater show of right in insisting that Eire should not be guilty of what Germany may regard as unneutral conductoIIIo9. The effect of the exclusion of Eire from the Common-wealth must be considered apart from the war,10.       On the assumption that Eire ceased to belong to theCommonwealth, whether as the result of her own overt actrecognised by the rest of the Commonwealth, or as the resultof a decision by this country and the Dominions to regard heras outside oh^ Commonwealth, a variety of difficult questions would fall to, be dealt witho     The most important single   -

question would relate to nationality.     The view taken inthis country has been that the inhabitants of Hire have remained British subjects, although the Irish nationality act of 1935 may have purported to alter this position.The ordinary common law rule is that where His Majesty hasacknowledged that a part of His Dominions has become independent, the inhabitants of the new Sovereign State whocontinue to reside there ^yo released from their allegianceand become aliens without any express provision to thateffecto     This is an exception to the general principle thatsubjects of His Majesty cannot, without his permission, be released from their allegiance,,     Those born in Ireland whowere residing here would not automatically lose theirnationality.,    They might do so if they promptly returned to eire and settled theree     Equally those in Eire at the timewho promptly came and settled here would probably be held tohave retained their British nationality,,    This would,broadly speaking, be the position if it was not dealt with by legislation,     Legislation could of course make any provision which the Legislature thought fit0     It would, however, be contrary to generally recognised principles if it was sought to deprive of their British nationality those who desired toretain it and were residing he?e0     There would also be stronggrounds for allowing those who so wished to retain british nationality, even though, the were, and desired to remain,resident in Eire0    In fact, legislation would undoubtedly be necessary, and as it would involve amendment ofthe British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, such

amendment accordingly to existing constitutional practice couldnot be introduced into Parliament here until it had been referred to and agreed by the Dominion Governments.11. Another important matter would arise with regard to imperial preference, possibly with far-reaching consequences.If Eire became a Sovereign Independent State, it would beimpossible for the United Kingdom to grant to the Free state the benefits of imperial preference, without entitling any foreign country which possessed most favoured nation rights in these matters to claim the same benefits.     We think it unnecessary to elaborate this point, which has, we understand,been considered on previous occasions in memoranda preparedfor the Irish Situation Committee.     Unemployment insurancewould in the main be unaffected,     With regard to non-contributory Old Age Pensions, those who remained Britishsubjects and continued to reside here would be unaffected, butaliens have no right to such pensions.      The right to contri-butory pensions would be unaffected so long as the pensionerscontinued to reside here.      The present rights of pensionerswho are resident in a Dominion would of course no longer applyto those resident in Eire.      The matter is complicated and ifit were desired to explore it further, the appropriate Depart-ments would no doubt be able to deal more exactly with theconsequences involved,IV18. The effect of the exclusion of Eire from theCommonwealth considered in relation to the war is necessarilyof supreme importance at present.IS. Prom the point of view of making use of Irish ports,or obtaining assistance from her in other ways, our positionwould be worse if Eire was a Sovereign Independent State than

it is at present.     Eire would, in these circumstances, becommitting the plainest possible breach of neutrality if sheactively rendered assistance in breach of ordinary neutralityrules? or allowed us to use her ports in the manner contemplatedUnsatisfactory as the present position is, it contains possi-Dilities which might be valuables hut which would vanish ifEire was excluded.      It can be said at present that the neutrality of a member of the Commonwealth is sui generis, andthat the principles affecting neutrality in ordinary circum-stances do not apply.      In other words, neutrality within theCommonwealth is not to he judged by the criteria applicable tonations outside the Commonwealth, but is limited by the con-ception of the Commonwealth itself.      It has been recognised -since the Treaty of Locarno, if not before,  that it was entirely for a Dominion to decide whether it should or shouldnot participate in a war.      (See Article 9 of The Treaty of locarno.)      It could be said that Eire&apos;s neutrality was an example of such non-participation or, if this were difficult,as perhaps it is in view of her continued diplomatic relationswith Germany,, it could be said that it was something betweennon-participation and neutrality as ordinarily understood.If Germany complained of any assistance that Eire might renderub or acquiesce in our takings the Eire Government could, if so minded, take this line.     What is perhaps more important is that from our point of view, we could, if the question aroseas to our using Irish ports, rely on the position of Eirewithin the Commonwealth.     Whatever action may be decided uponwith regard to Eire, we are of opinion that even if exclusionwere a simple matter it could only result in putting -greater

difficulties in our way than are there at present.      Anyattempt in those circumstances, for example, to use the portsby force or against the wishes of the Government of Eire,would he represented as a plain act of aggression.     Theeffect on world opinion might he unfortunate.      we naturallyexpress no opinion on whether the use of force in existingcircumstances would he right or practicable., but if it were decided to take or to use the ports, although there might inthat case be unwelcome reactions in the UoSoA. and elsewhere,the act would be an act taken within territory of which HisMajesty is at present Kings and the inhabitants of which theUnited Kingdom Government can confidently maintain oweallegiance to him.14. We are conscious that this memorandum extends beyond discussion of purely legal or constitutional issues.      Forthe reasons already mentioned in paragraph 6, we think i&quot;&amp; isimpossible to exclude a reference to some of the political aspects in attempting to set out the legal position.(Signed)    CALDECOTE,D.B.
