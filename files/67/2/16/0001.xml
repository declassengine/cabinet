C.L,10(This document is the Property of His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government.)SECRET k Copy No. 4-.fyrTa) (39) 65WAR   CABINET.THE ATTITUDE OP THE PRESS TO THE ACTIVITIES OPGOVEEMvLENT DEPARTMENTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF INFOiMATION.The Committee on Home Security at their meeting on30th October desired me to draw the attention of the War Cabinet tothe question of the attitude of the Press to the activities of thevarious Civil Departments of the Government.The columns of the newspapers are daily filled withcomplaints of administrative incompetency and inefficiency.      The mosttrivial instances of mistakes are given prominence and pilloried asexamples of &quot;muddle&quot; and arbitariness.     One paper invites its readersto send in their grievances.     Little or nothing is said about thereasons for restrictions, the efforts made to grant relaxations, thedifficulties of adapting emergency legislation to the infinitely varyingconditions of individual lives.     The case for the Departments is allowed to go by default while the attack affords ample material forfomenting discontent and unrest.The cumulative effect of this constant detraction is undoubtedly unfortunate from the point of view of the public morale.The impression gets about that the Government never can do anythingright.But as Minister of Information I am no less concerned withthe effect on opinion abroad of this adverse criticism of theGovernment in its various domestic war measures.     These attacks by our own Press on the efficiency of our administration at home provideenemy propaganda with welcome material and I have ample indications of

its use against us.     I attach a few samples from German &quot;broadcasts.The question is how this unfortunate campaign on the part ofthe Press can be countered or at least checked.     There is no press censorship in this Country and the Press can publish what they choose,subject only to the Defence of the Realm Regulations.     That being so,persuasion seems the only means available.     It is for consideration whether the matter has not now become so serious as to justify thePrime Minister in inviting the Newspaper Proprietors to meet him inorder that he may impress upon them the grave detriment which thenational interest, both at home and abroad, is suffering from thepresent campaign of detraction.MNovember 1st. 1939-APPENDIX.EXTRACTS FROM GERMAN BROADCASTS.DEUTSCHLANDSENDER IN GERMAN, October 23rd.Complaints as to inefficient organisation were previouslyseen only in English Opposition papers, but now the Government papers&quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Telegraph&quot; also contain criticisms.(Charles Ponsoriby&apos; s letter Times, October 1lfth.Leading article Times, October 16th on the Controls.)FROM ZEESEN IN ENGLISH FOR NORTH AMERICA.

FROM FRANKFURT IN FRENCH, October 26th.&quot;Daily Express&quot; also protests against bureaucratic rule.(&quot;Daily Express&quot;   21.10-39-21*-, 10.39.)DEUTSCHLANDSENDER FOR GERMANY IN GERMAN, October 27th.The &quot;Daily Express&quot; points the finger of scorn at british cabinet Ministers one by one and openly accuses them of incompetence.Then what does the Cabinet do?

Labour and Liberal members silent forweeks are again asking numerous questions in Commons.     &quot;News Chronicle&quot;says M.P.&apos;s are flooded with letters of protest.     Dingle-Foot pointedout that the Commons did not realise when granting powers to theGovernment in September that these would be abused till a state ofdictatorship was almost reached.(Numerous references in British press, including News Chronicle,for 28.10.39.)8. FROM ZEESEN IN ENGLISH FOR NORTH AMERICA, October 22nd.British industry, in open revolt against Government, demandscomplete co-ordination between capital and labour.
