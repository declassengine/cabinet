T.90. COPY NO r   I  war CABINET.SEIZURE OP EXPORTS PROM GERMANY.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare,In pursuance of the Conclusion of Item 7 of the76th Meeting of the War Cabinet held on 9th November,I circulate herewith a memorandum regarding the seizure of German exports prepared in the Ministry of economic warfare (Annex A), together with the report of a Committeeconvened to consider the legal aspects of this question(Annex B).(Intld.) R.H.C.of Economic Warfare,November, 1939.

ANNEX   AcSEIZURE OF EXPORTS -FROM GERMANY,The policy of the Ministry of Economic Warfarebeing to prevent the import into Germany of goods and materials necessary for the prosecution of the war,  it follows that the means by which Germany can procure such goods and materials is a matter of prime interest to theMinistry.      In this war, unlike the last war, Germany hasfew foreign assets and restricted possibility of raisingcredit abroad.      Her assets in gold are roughly estimatedat about  40,000,000 and her stock of foreign exchange at about  15,000,000.      Her ability to purchase goods of vital necessity, viz,, oil,  copper and other minerals crores, feeding stuffs, etc,,  depend upon these slenderassets and upon her power to export goods in payment forher imports.      Her gold and foreign exchange cannot lasther for long and her power to export must therefore beregarded as part of her life line.The question of German exports is therefore paramountamong considerations of economic warfare.      With exports toneighbouring neutrals we cannot directly interfere;    we can,however, try to limit them by the operation of our war trade agreements.      But it is within our power to stopalmost entirely German exports carried in neutral vessels to overseas countries, hy means of which Germany canreplenish her foreign exchange resources.There would doubtless be reprisals on the Germanside,  and these reprisals would injure our own exports tosuch countries, e.g.  those on the Baltic which lie withiru

the German sphere of control.      Our imports from thosecountries when carried in neutral ships are already subjectto German measures of contraband control, which have putserious difficulties in the way of our getting importantsupplies of timber,  flax and foodstuffs.     However, neutral ships carrying such goods to the United Kingdom could stilluse Norwegian and Swedish territorial waters, even when germany redoubles her activity in consequence of our inter-ference with her exports;    and we should be able to maintaincontact with those territorial waters by means of convoysacross the North Sea.      Our exports to Denmark consist ofcoal, manufactures and to some extent of re-exported rawmaterials and feeding stuffs.      At present Denmark exportsfoodstuffs both to the United Kingdom and to Germany;    so if feedingstuffs from overseas were cut off, Germany wouldherself be the sufferer.      This is a consideration which atpresent dominates the situation;    and by a kind of tacitagreement Germany does not interfere with Danish foodexports to the United Kingdom, while we do not stop theexport of feeding stuffs to Denmark.      If, as a result ofaction against German exports, Germany were to abandon thistacit agreement, it would be to our disadvantage, but itwould also be to the disadvantage of Germany.To sum up,  if the action here recommended were taken,our trade would probably lose, but German trade would losemuch more.There would also, no doubt, be an intensification ofGerman exports to those neighbouring countries (e.g.Scandinavia and the Balkans) where their transit would beimmune from interference.      The fact, however, that Germany

would be even less able than she is now to pay for asubstantial proportion of her imports from these countriesin free exchange (seeing that we should have cut off hersupply of dollars etc.) would strengthen our own chiefweapon for competing in those particular markets which itis in our power to supply with raw material from overseas.It is, of course, impossible to estimate what theGerman exports to overseas countries amount to in war conditions.      In 1938 they amounted to RM, 1,208 millions(about  100,000,000).      The amount now exported must bevery considerably less; but even so, information receivedindicates that Germany attaches great importance to them.For example,  the sale of German machinery in Brazil allowsher to buy coffee, which she sells to the United States.With the dollars thus acquired she is enabled to buy from neutral countries the petroleum which she would be unableto get if she could only offer to pay in blocked marks.There is some reason to believe that the Germans are trying to buy the wool clip in Uruguay for the same kind of purpose.It is known that the Reichsbank is prepared to indemnifyexporters to the Dutch East Indies on a F.O.B. basis for all goods shipped to that destination and subsequently lost.The legal position has been examined by a Committee,presided ever by the Attorney-General, whose report showsthat action is not free from difficulties.The Ministry of Economic Warfare recognise the legal difficulties which have prevented us so far from interfering with German exports, but hopes that it will be possible to overcome these difficulties so that effective action may betaken as soon as possible to stop all exports of goods ofGerman origin going to overseas countries which pass through our Contraband Control.

The difficulties with regard to neutral countrieswhich such action may cause are also appreciated.      But itis believed that the aim in view, which is the shorteningof the war,  should prevail over these objections.     Althoughindividual interests in neutral countries and possibly certain sections of legal opinion may protest against such action,the general trend of neutral opinion should not react as strongly against such interference as was the case in thelast ware      There is reason to think that such action was infact expected from the outset of hostilitiesoAs a powerful maritime country whose blockade measures will always be one of our most potent weapons,  it would seemto be in our permanent interest to try  to   broaden thebasis on which, under international law, action can be taken against the enemy&apos;s commerce,  and provided we are satisfiedthat our action is not such as will morally estrange theopinion of the world.       But this point will not directlyarise if it is decided that action can be taken by way ofreprisalSrIt is recommended therefore that,  if the legtl cueais considered adequate, a decision should be taken as soonas possible to interfere with exports of German originunder conditions that will prevent the payment for such goods becoming available for Germany,      The precise arrange-ments, in order to give effect to this, would require to be carefully considered.There is also reason to believe that such a decisions would be welcome to the French Government who have made representations  to the Ministry of Economic Warfare urging

?Q1^ y -such action.      The French Government do not appear to he so much impressed, as we have been, by the legal objectionsto this course;    they admit that more serious difficultiesmay be caused by protests from neutral countries and they suggest that, as a preliminary step, the position shouldbe explained to the Unite-d-State^^Government and theirreaction^ ascertained^.

ANNEX B.REPORT.This Committee was convened at the request of theMinistry of Economic Warfare to consider the legal aspectsof the right to take reprisals &quot;by way of interference with german exports, in the light of illegal action already takenby the German Government.      The Committee was constitutedas follows:-The Attorney General.The Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office.Representatives of the Procurator-General&apos;department.Representatives of the Ministry of economic warfare, with their Legal Adviser.Representatives of the Admiralty.A representative of the Board of Trade.1. It is a recognised principle of internationallaw that breaches of lav/ by one belligerent entitle theother to appropriate reprisals.     The basis of this right and its extent was considered during the last war^ notably in the Sjtigstad, 2 B.-  and CP.C 179, the Leonora.3 B. and C.P.C. 131 and 385s and the Zamora, SB, and C.P.C. 1.An Order-in-Council declaring the Government&apos;s intentionto take action by way of reprisals would be regarded bythe Prize Court as conclusive of the facts recited, butthe Court would be free to consider whether on general principles the action taken was justified.     Those casesmake it clear that the validity of the action taken by wayof reprisals is to be judged in relation to the nature and extent of the enemy1s disregard of international law andthe injury thereby occasioned.      Broadly speaking, it may

be said that on the basis of those cases the action takenhy way of reprisals must not he out of proportion to theinjuries inflicted and should operate in the same generalarea.     We cannot do better than quote two passages fromthe judgment of the Privy Council in the Stigstad.- 5 Bcand C.P.C. 551-2;-&quot;Still less would it be proper for such a Court to enquire into the reasons of policy, military or others which have been the cause and are to be the&quot; justifica-tion for resorting to retaliation for that misconduct.Its function is9 in protection of the rights of neutrals3to weigh on a proper occasion the measures of retaliation-tion which have been adopted in facts and to enquire whether they are. in their nature or extent, other thancommensurate with the prior wrong done5 and whetherthey inflict on neutrals, when they are looked at as awhole inconvenience greater than is reasonable underall the circumstances.....0....    In considering whethermore inconvenience is inflicted upon neutrals than thecircumstances involve9 the frequency and the enormity ofthe original wrongs are alike material, for the moregross and universal those wrongs are the more are all nations concerned in their repressions and bound fortheir part to submit to such sacrifices as that repres-sion involves.      It is right to recall that as neutralcommerce suffered and was doomed to suffer gross preju-dice from the illegal policy proclaimed and acted on bythe German Governments so it profited by and obtainedrelief from retaliatory measures, if effective to restrain., to punish and to bring to an end such injuriousconduct.      Neutralss whose principles or policy lead themto refrain from punitory or repressive action of theirowns may well be called on to bear a passive part in thenecessary suppression of courses which are fatal to thefreedom of ail who use the seas.&quot;2. The facts which were suggested as justifying repri-sals by way of interference with exports from Germany were(a) illegal sinkings, and(b) the possible invasion of Holland, or Belgium.We will consider first the illegal sinkings.

were that 32 British ships and 3 allied ships had 73een sunkillegally, in some cases in circumstances of greatinhumanity, between the oiitbreak of war and the hth November.In the same period at least 16 neutral vessels had been sunkin circumstances which led to the conclusion that the sinking or circumstances connected with it had been illegal .*It was pointed out that although the total numbers of shipssunk had on the whole decreased, the proportion of thosesunk illegally to the total had increased.     Although therehas been no such public declaration by the GermanGovernment of an illegal policr/ as existed, in the last war,these sinkings which, though a small percentage, are considerable in number, evidence an intention to sinkmerchant tonnage coming to or going from this country in circumstances which violate the rules of maritime warfare.Apart from other illegalities, the German policy appears tohave no regard to the nature, ownership or destination of the cargo.     No great difficulty is felt about the absence of adeclaration by Germany.      The difficulty arises from theimportance that is attached in the passages cited from the,Stif-;stad to the frequency, as well as the enormity, of theoriginal wrongs in considering the reasonableness of theinjuries to be inflicted on neutrals by way of reprisals.In this connexion reference would be made to the actual facts and figures and to the statements made on behalf of theGovernment as to the effectiveness of the steps taken todeal with the U-boat menace and the extent to which our normal sea-borne trade was proceeding.      If neutrals werex There have been attacks on as many as 33 neutral ships.

minded to protest, they could base their protests on theprinciples to which we have referred.     Such protests might-be difficult to answer and would inevitably have some effecton the Prize Court, which has among other matters to weighthe degree of inconvenience and injury to neutrals.k.   The Possible Invasion of Holland or Belp;ium.Normally no doubt if one belligerent in the course of awar declares war on a hitherto neutral country as a resultof some action by or dispute with that country, no questionof this being a ground for reprisals could be raised.Germany v/ould no doubt put forward some pretext for herattack on Holland or Belgium.      If, however, it werereasonably clear that the invasion was for the purpose of enabling Germany more effectively to prosecute the war against the allies by the occupation of neutral territory,different considerations would arise.    It could be saidthat the act of invasion was a violation in the mostextreme form of an elementary principle oi the law ofnations enshrined in Article 1 of Hague Convention No. which  declares the territory of neutral Powers inviolable.So viewed, the action could be made the basis of reprisals and the question would be whether the reprisalscontemplated, which involve interference with the rights neutrals, were appropriate to the German action.      It mustbe admitted that if a belligerent makes unlawful use of neutral territory, the appropriate reprisal is normally toentitle the other belligerent to use that neutral territory in a similar way and also to go on the neiitral territory

to stop the illegal use.     The reprisals contemplated herewould he of a different character, and if Holland resistedand became a belligerent, we do not know of any case in thepast in which reprisals have followed on an invasion soresisted.      It might of course be possible to show that onepurpose of the invasion was to assist the illegal attacks onour shipping.      The hypothetical invasion cannot he considered in isolation apart from the existing illegalitiesreferred to in paragraph 3.     While giving full weight tothe unprecedented character of this suggested basis, we feel that it could legitimately he relied on, at any ratein conjunction with the illegal sinkings.5.        We have dealt with the illegal sinkings and thepossible invasion of Holland or Belgium as bases for thereprisals contemplated.      In both cases we have indicated that such action would go beyond precedents and undoubtedlyarguments could be raised against it.     he considered thepossibility of giving the action proposed by way of reprisals a broader basis by relying on the use by theGerman Government of force or the threat of force to violatethe fundamental rights of nations recognised by international law to independence and peaceful existence.This could be illustrated and reinforced according to circumstances by referring to conventions and undertakings which Germany has violated and it would be matter forconsideration whether this list should not be headed byby the Kellogg Pact.     Prom the strictly legal point ofview this would be a novel basis for reprisals ofthe kind contemplated. On the other hand, if

such a view were in harmony with neutral opinion at thetime? it would seern neither inappropriate nor unreasonable to ash neutrals to submit to the interference contemplatedif it can be shown that the cutting off of German exportsis a measure of real importance in Germany&apos;s defeat.5.     General Conclusions.    We feel that, as things are atpresent, the illegal sinkings form a possible though doubtfulbasis for the reprisals contemplated.     But the Committee allfelt difficulty about action on this basis at present unless it were possible to convince opinion at home and abroad of the damage done and the dislocation being caused to our trade and shipping.     The invasion of Holland and Belgium would be astrong reinforcement and would make more appropriate the putting of the whole in general setting suggested in paragraph5,     We do not think that the general setting referred to would remove the difficulties which exist as to the illegalsinkings by themselves.     On the other hand, what we have said about Holland and Belgium might apply of those countries werenot invaded but there were some other gross violation ofinternational law.      It is unnecessary to add that if the illegal sinkings increased, the matter would have to be re-considered, as the difficulties under that head are related tothe extent of the injury being inflicted.7.     In the above paragraphs we have dealt with the matter as one of reprisals, which we feel must be the basis for it.it is, however, to be noted that there are some who feel thatthe immunity of exports under international law is somewhatof an unreality in the modern world and in modern wars.      Ithas been suggested that either by an extension of the doctrine of blockade or by a special interpretation of the Declarationof Paris interference with enemy exports could be justified asan extension of existing principles.     These suggestions were

considered, on October last year by a Legal Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence(Paper Kb. (L), IS), which came to the conclusionthat no such procedure could be found which was not opento objections on existing international law principles.It would, however, de desirable, if possible, so to frameany Order-in-Council instituting reprisals as to leave this line of argument open.(Signed)    D.3.
