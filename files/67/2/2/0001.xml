At their meeting on the 11th October, 1939 the HomeiPolicy Committee appointed a Sub-Committee composed asfollows:-The Minister of Pood    (In the Chair),The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The Secretary ox State for? Scotland,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister3 of Health,The Minister of Labour,The Minister- of Agriculture and Fisheries,The Minister of Economic warfareto examine and report to the Committee generally on theamount of the civilian rations proposed in the Minister ofFood&apos;s memoranda/ and also on the question whether havingregard to the experience of the Great War it might not be practicable to reduce the amounts earmarked for the FightingServices of the five foodstuffs to be rationed, with a viewso far as possible to eliminating waste.(The Minister of Shipping was subsequently added tothe bub-Commit tee).The Sub-Committee have held two meetings and closelyexamined the estimates upon which the original rationingproposals set out in   Paper No. H, P.C. (39) 39   were based.

FrenchREVISED QUANTITIES..2o The supply situation has improved during the last fortnight,,      Exports from Denmark have teen resumed and a contract has &quot;been concluded for the supply of meat from theArgentine for the period up to 31st January, 19^-0o3. The Sub-Committee is of opinion that it is not practicable at the present stage to fix the quantity of the ration to be allowed over a long periods     Attention has,therefore, &quot;been directed mainly to the anticipated supply position during the three months 1st November, 1939 to 31stJanuary, 19h0.4. During this period it is hoped that the requirements ofServiceKequir ement s.army requirements, the French Army may be met by the allocation of 51,000 tons offrozen meat out of the 200,000 tons to be shipped from theArgentine under the contract just concluded.,      This will leavelIi-9,000 tons for the United Kingdom which is equal to normalexports during this period of the year,5c The Sub-Committee has been furnished with the result ofan enquiry by a special Committee set up by the secretary ofState for War (i)  to consider the possibility of reducing Armyand Air Force requirements by dividing the Army into categoriesbased on dietary needs, and (ii) to submit revised estimates of army and Air Force requirements during the next six months.It has &quot;been found impracticable to differentiate bety/eenvarious blanches of the Army and Air Force according tooccupation.     A similar attempt made in the Great War met withthe same result.      The l/ar Office Committee has, however, re-calculated the requirements of the Army and Air Force on theassumption that the meat ration of the Forces at home could bereduced from 12 to 10 oz. a day and the bacon ration from 2 oz.to oz, a day.If this is done the approximate savings

would amount to 49,000 tons of meat and 10,000 tons ofbacon a year.      If this reduction is made the monetary value ofthe ration would be reduced by a penny.      It lias been estimated that to replace with other foodstuffs the loss ofnutriment occasioned by the proposed cut in meat and baconwould cost a gross 3d or allowing for the Id per day saved onmeat and bacon a nett 2d per day.      Each penny increase in the cash ration costs  Tg- Ljillion for one million men per year.6. The Sub-Committee in calculating the Quantity of meat which is likely to be available for the civilian population have proceeded on the assumption that the WarCabinet will approve of the reduction in the meat and baconration to the Forces at home which are mentioned in theprevious paragraph.      It lias further been assumed that no reduction will be made in the per capita ration for theNavy or- of troops on active service overseas.7. The Sub-Committee is of opinion that commanding officers in the Army and Air Force should be asked toexercise general surveillance of the utilisation of food supplies by their men, and not to draw full rations if themen were not requiring and in fact were not consuming thefull authorised ration.      If arrangements were made for suchsavings to be made available for civilian consumption, theeffect might be of great value especially if later in the warthe general supply position were to deteriorate.8. The Sub-Committee is of opinion that if the measuresoutlined in paragraphs 5-7 above are adopted, there would beno reason to anticipate any general criticism of the comparison between the amount of the Service rations andthat of the civilian ration.

9. The Sub-Committee, in addition to taking account ofthe reduced allocations referred to in the preceding paragraphs, has made several further substantial changesin the calculations on which the original proposals were based;      These may be summarised as follows(a) It has been assumed that the arrivals from overseas will be normal up to 31st January,1940 and no specific deduction has beenmade for sinkings or delays now that theconvoying of ships is in operation;(b) The quantity to be put to reserve has beenreduced to an amount sufficient for a working reserve, leaving the stock on thehoof as the reserve against any prolongedinterruption in the arrival of supplies from overseas;(c) No provision has been made for extra rationsfor Heavy Workers or Adolescent Boys.10.        With regard to (c)  the Sub-Committee were informed(i)  that Sir Walter Citrine had been consulted and had expressed the opinion that the Trade Union Congress wouldbe opposed - at any rate at this stage - to discrimination between one class of worker and another and (ii)  thatmedical opinion did not endorse the original proposal togive an additional ration either to heavy workers oradolescents.11.        The effect of the above Alterations which the Sub-Committee recommend should be adopted is that it isestimated that 395,000 tons of meat will be available for civilian consumption in the three months 1st November 1939 -31st January 1940.     Allowing for children up to six yearsof age being provided with a 50% ration of meat (but anadult1s ration of other foodstuffs) the available supplies will be equal to 29 oz.s for each adult per week and 14-g- oz.for each child.     As, however, it is necessary to expressx    The comparable amount for the succeeding three months(i.e,  1st February to 30th April,  1940) is 24 oz., but itis not possible to calculate the quantity accurately until further information is available as to the possibility ofincreasing imports during that periodt,

the meat ration in terms of value instead of weight theSub-Committee recommends that the ration should be,  atthe outset,  2/- for each adult5  and 1/- for each childunder 6 years of age.      On the average these sums willpurchase more than 29 oz,  and 14-j? oz..  respectively, but is the Sub-Committee sees no objection to this because manyless well-to-do families will not be  in a position topurchase the full meat ration which is above the average level of consumption.,Bacon and 12o        The supply position of bacon and butter during the butter.next three months will depend very largely on arrivals fromDenmarko      Imports will,  it is expected, be increased laterfrom the Empire and other countries.      The home productionof bacon will also,  it is anticipated, be expanded.,      Thesupplies from all sources at present in sight would enable a ration to be provided of 4 oz-  of bacon per week and4 oz.  of butter per weeko      It should be possible tomaintain these quantities provided Danish imports continue.Margarine 13.        In view of the recent acute shortage of butter,and Cookingjfets. consequent on the cutting off of Danish supplies as wellas the delay in the arrival of imports from Australia andNew Zealand,  the manufacture of margarine which is now

under the control of the Ministry of Food has been raised in recent weeks to 50% above normal.      This level ofproduction equal to 4 ozo per head of the population can be  continued provided that the import of the necessaryraw materials is maintained and that the manufacturing capacity is not reduced by aerial attacko        In thesecircumstances the Sub-Committee recommend that margarineshould not be rationed at the outset.      If, however, theshortage of butter supplies should lead to the demand formargarine being increased beyond the available supply, itwill be necessary to impose rationing,14.       The same applies to cooking fats the present. supplyof which - equivalent to 3 oza per head per week - is under-stood to be approximately equal to normal consumption.15.       The supply position of sugar is at present favourableand would enable a ration to be allowed of 1 lb.&apos; per head,which is twice as much as the present German ration andtwice as much as was allowed..in Great Britain in 1918.The favourable position has caused the Sub-Committee toconsider carefully whether in existing circumstances itis necessary to ration sugar at allo      The majority ofmembers recommend that sugar should be rationed but theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotlanddesire to give the matter further consideration..

16.       The facts with regard to present and future suppTdoeof sugar together with some other considerations whichshould be taken into account in reaching a decision whether sugar should be rationed or not are set out inthe Appendix to this Report,,    One of the most important factors   is that home production when added to the Empiresupplies, which have recently been purchased under afavourable contract, will not be sufficient to providefor home consumption and essential exports (to Eire,Mediterranean etc.) for more than 9 months normalconsumption.,    If consumption were to continue at thelevel of the last two months, the supplies would last for a considerably shorter period than 9 months..Purchases of foreign sugars will,  in any case be necessary.At present their price is entirely out of relation tothe basis at which Empire sugars were recently purchased.If it is known that supplies already &quot;in sight&quot; are beingrapidly consumed there will be no prospect of a reductionof price for foreign sugars and they may eventually haveto be purchased at a price greatly in excess of the agreedEmpire price.      The result of the non-rationing of sugar may, therefore- be  (l) to increase the demand for shipping tonnage?    (ii) to antagonise Empire producersfrom whom supplies have already been purchased;    and(iii) increase the cost of sugar throughout the war,17.       The majority of the Sub-Committees accordingly recommend that a ration of 1 Ibo per head per week be imposed but that for the present at any rate, no attempt should be made to ration the serving of sugar to customersin hotels, restaurants and catering establishments.      Ifthis course is adopted, the Sub-Committee understands that

the available supplies will he sufficient to permit ofallocations being made to manufacturers on approximatelytheir pre-war consumption plus a margin for season and special demands.     As regards the sugar requirements of theServices the Sub-Committee have been informed that the WarOffice consider that the &amp;&amp;pvico ration, sin on Id be^-raiged^to3oz. per day.     The Sub-Committee concurs in this proposal.WHY RATIONING IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY.18. As will have been seen from the preceding paragraphs the Sub-Commit--t&amp;eJb.as ,given consideration to the-need forrationing each of the various foods which have been underdiscussion.     In the case of butter and bacon supplies are considerably below normal and rationing is the only meansof securing equitable distribution of the supplies available.It is understood that grocers, generally speaking, aredesirous that the rationing of these two foods and of sugar(which has been dealt with in some detail in paragraphs 16and 17 and the Appendix) should begin as quickly as possible.The Ministry of Pood is being subjected to e considerableamount of criticism in Parliament and the Press becauserationing has not already been imposed^     Retailers areexperiencing considerable difficultyr-in-fche -absence of rationing, in satisfying-the requirements of customers inrespect of bacon, butter and sugar.     These difficulties have been greatly increased by the recent re-distributionof population which has rendered the allocation of suppliesby wholesalers to retailers on the basis of pre-warpurchases unsuited to present conditions.19. The position with regard to meat is somewhat different.     The total supplies available are, at present,equal to normal.     But the allocation of increased supplies to the Services results in a considerable reduction

in the quantity available for civilian consumption,,Moreover the Services are supplied with imported meat withthe result that instead of imported and home producedsupplies available for civilians being approximately equalin quantity, as they are normally, they will during thethree months 1st November 1939 to 31st January 1.94&apos;? be inthe proportion of about 35 to 65c     The shortage of imported(being the cheaper) supplies is causing considerabledifficulty in working class areas and also in the manufacturing,industry (sausages, meat pies, etc. )0     Rationing wouldovercome these difficulties because imported and home produced supplies would be &quot;pooled&quot; as in the Great War andsold at an average price0200 Rationing of the individual consumer involves a close control over supplies0     As home produced fatstock reach the market in thousands of different centres,an elaborate and complicated scheme is necessary to enablethe Ministry of Pood to purchase all such stock andallocate meat supplies through wholesalers to everyretail butcher^     A scheme similar in broad outline tothe one which is at present in an advanced stage of preparation was operated in the Great War and on the wholeit worked reasonably smoothly0     It is, however, inevitable that there will be some difficulties and criticisms whenthe scheme is put into operation as it is necessary toregulate the markets to which farmers can bring their stocks and also to restrict substantially the number of slaughter-houses to be usede     The Sub -Committeeaccordingly recommends that the Ministry of Pood should beauthorised to give the scheme a &quot;trial-run&quot; for a fortnight before the date when individual consumers willbe able to obtain ration?r! meat c-u!!y in return for acoupon0

DATE. OF. INTRODUCTION..22o   For various reasons it will not &quot;be possible to arrangefor the issue of rationing books, based on the NationalRegister schedules, to be completed before 1st November,assuming that the War Cabinet gives approval on 25th instant.An interval must be allowed for the books to be re^addressedand delivered to persons who have changed their address sinceNational Registration Day and have not already givennotification of the change;    for all consumers to registerwith retailers of their choice;    for each retailer to informhis Food Control Office, of the zcsiber of his registeredcustomers;    and for this information to be passed to the selected wholesalers.    It is accordingly considered thatrationing could not be brought into operation for any commodity before Monday, 20th Novembero23o   Although there is an interval of four weeks between now and the 20th November, rationing could not be brought intoforce on the latter date unless decisions are taken at onceso as to enable the essential administrative arrangements tobe proceeded with.   Moreoever,  it is very important that adequate time should be available to enable the case forrationing and for the particular measures decided upon to be properly presented to the press and the public.    So far little progress has been made as regards publicity because, in theabsence of decisions,  it has teen impossible to present a sufficiently clear picture of the Government^ intentions.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONSo24.    The Sub-Committee recommend that the War Cabinet shouldbe asked to approve the following proposalss-

Services.1. That the meet ration for the Array and Air Force troops at home he reduced from 12 to 10 oz.  of meat per day andfrom 2 oa. to 1/7 oz.  of bacon per day.2. That the Army and Air Force troops should be entitledto draw up to 3 oz. a day of sugar,  (the present standardration is Vb oz. per day   but this is increased to 3 or 4 oz*)3. That attention be drawn to the War Office estimate that, fully to compensate for the reduction in the moatand bacon ration recommended under (1) above,  would require a net increase: of 2d a day in the cash portion of the ration.4. That no alteration be made in the ratioas for theITavy or the ..rmy and Air Force on active service overseas.5. That all commanding officers be ashed not to drawfull rations if their men are not requiring and in factnot consuming the full authorised ration;    and thatarrangements should be made to ensure that any savings thuseffected are made available for civilian consumption.Civilians.6. That rationing of some commodities should be putinto operation at an early date.7. That with this object the Pood Control committees should be instructed to begin issuing Rationing Boohsforthwith with a view to completing the issue as soon aspracticable.There was no reason why the posting of the RationBooks should not commence on 26th October.

8.        That in view of the fact that the meat ration, whenit is imposed, will, under the proposals set out in thisReport, he considerably larger than any meat ration in forcein the Great War,  it is not necessary to contemplate atpresent supplementary rations &quot;boi?.\g given to:-Heavy workers,  andadolescents.9. The rationing Documents to be issued are, therefore,to be restricted at the outset to:-(l) Persons over 6 years of age.(2)   Children undergo years of age,the rations of the latter being 50% of the adult meat ration tor- persons over pix years of age but identical asregards the other commodities.10.       That it is unnecessary at the cutset to rationeither:-Oooking Pats, orMargarine.11.       That whether it hereafter becomes necessary to rationthese commodities,  should depend on whether the demand forthem increases considerably consequent on the shortage of butter.12.       That the Minister of Pood should be authorised toimpose the rationing off-Sugar KButter, andBacon,either separately or all at one date whenever theadministrative arrangements are ready.13.       Tne Minister of Pood should make every effortpracticable to ensure that the quantity of the ration at the outset should not be less thans-Sugar - 1 lb. per head per week.Butter - 4 oz. 11        &quot;        &quot;      &quot;Bacon - 4 oz.    &quot;        11        &quot;      &quot;14.       That sugar consumed in hotels, restaurants and catering establishments should be free from rationing.*   The recommendation in the case of sugar is not unanimous.(See Paragraph 15).

23rd October, 1959.15.       That as regards meat,  the Minister of Food should he authorised in view of the necessarily complicated nature ofthe distributive arrangements,  to invite the public tocarry out a trial rationing scheme on a voluntary basis for,say, a fortnight before the ration is imposed, that is -(a) Consumers would be asked to register withthe butcher to whom they would be &quot;tied&quot;when rationing begins, and to restrict their purchases of rationed meat to theirregistered butcher;    and(b) Consumers would also be asked to limit their purchases of rationed meat to 2/- per head per week,16. That steps should be taken ait once to prepare thepublic for developments along the lines -above indicated.(Intd ) WotfoM.Chairman of the Sub-committee

APPENDIX.SUGAR SUPPLIES AND RATIONING.1. The following table shows the quantity of rawsugar which arrived in the United Kingdom in each of thefour successive weeks up to 7th October and the quantitymelted and the total stocks held.Raw Sugar - Tons.y/eek ended      Arrivals       Total melted (including     Totaldirect consumption raw       Stockssugar).Sept. 16 25,557 63,602 269,000&quot;      33 32,159 69,097 245,000&quot;      30 29,188 59,274 234,000Octr.    7 55,741 49,170 233,0002* During these four weeks Government reserve stocksfell from 122,929 tons on 16th September to 83,000 tons on 7th October.     Also arrivals during the week ended 7th Octoberincluded 4,000 tons of home-grown sugar beet.3* Stocks actually in the country or in sight amountto 1,877,000 tons of sugar (raw value) which is equivalentto ten months&apos; supply on normal pre-war basis excludingexports.      Sugars &quot;in sight&quot; are made up of 279,000 tons rawafloat, 835,000 tons raw purchased, but not yet shipped, andthe estimated balance of the home-grown crop 530,000 tons.But these figures are not as good as they appear because(a) Exports cannot be excluded.     Apart from&apos; thedesirability of maintaining exports as a matterof general policy, supplies must be providedfor the Mediterranean, Yifest African and otherColonies which are likely to absorb about 2,500tons monthly.      There is a further potentialdemand from Eire, Malaya and British india which it is difficult to estimate.      Exportsto all countries in pre-war years representedabout 350,000 tons of white sugar.(b) Home-grown beet sugar production will cease inJanuary.     After that there is at this momentno sugar actually contracted except the B.W.I.and other Empire Sugars which will come in atthe rate of only about 30,000 tons weekly.At the appropriate time steps will be taken to buy non-Empire sugars.     Their price at preser/tis entirely out of relation to the basis of

7/66U per cwto  at which Empire sugars werebought and, if there is any suspicion that supplies in the United Kingdom are short itwill be impossible to &quot;buy at a reasonablefigure.     To be driven to buy non-Empiresugars at prices greatly in excess of the agreed Empire price would not only involveheavy expenditure, hut would antagonise theEmpire producer and jeopardise the prospects of making favourable Empire contracts for the1940 crops in Queensland, South Africa,Mauritius and Fiji, and the 1941 crops in theB.V. I.      If, when the time comes?, it is foundnecessary-to buy non-Empire sugars at prices markedly in excess of the 7/6d. per cwt. basis,it will he of some assistance to be able to say to the Empire producer that, through rationing,all reasonable economy in the utilisation of empire and home supplies has been exercised.(c) There can he no certainty that, in the absenceof rationing, estimates of future consumptioncan be &quot;based on the pre-war normalo      Hoardingmay, or may not, be eliminated,,     Somethingmust be allov/ed for the additional requirementsof the Forces both in jam and ration sugar.At the moment there is a shortage of glucose.These are considerable factors in themselves,and their combined effect may he serious.&quot;4, Experience has shown that it is not easy withoutrationing to secure an equitable distribution of sugaramong wholesale distributors and -that it is impossibleas &quot;between the retailer and the consumer.5* On a careful examination of the statistics andOther relevant factors,  it is considered that the proposedration of 16 ozs. per head per week.JTor-...djomej3tlc consumptioncould he provided with adequate supplies to catering establishments and to manufacturers on approximately their pre-war consumption plus a margin for seasonal and specialdemands, such as the requirements of the Services.
