t48Ug DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.    /3.(Gj  (59)55.WAR CABINET.THE AIR RAID WARNING- SYSTEM.Proposed statement by the Secretary of State for Air.The Home Secretary and I think it desirable to makea public statement as to the Government&apos;s policy with regardto the sounding of air-raid warnings, and I circulate herewithfor the approval of the War Cabinet the draft of an answer,in reply to a Private Notice Question, which I propose to give in the House of Commons tomorrow, Wednesday, 25th October, 1939.The draft has been agreed between our two departments.(Intd. )       K.W.AIR MINISTRY.24th October, 1939.

To ask the Secretary of State for Air whether,  inaccordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s undertaking, theGovernment have now reviewed the circumstances in which air-raid warnings are given.Sir Kingsley Wood replied:-Yes, Sir.The House will &quot;be aware that orders to sound publicair-raid warnings are given by the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command.There are two possible lines of policy.      One is tohave the public warnings sounded in any district over which an approaching aircraft may pass,  and to do so on alloccasionsi    the other is to do so only when, in the judgment of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, an air attack on thedistrict is probable.     The first alternative would result infrequent interruption of industrial activity, often withoutany real need.      The other involves an element of risk, but-recent experience shows that it is the right policy to adopt.The House will realise that it is not the soundingof a public warning that brings our active defences intooperation.     This is done by quite other means.      It follows that vigorous action against the enemy may be in progresswithout an air-raid warning having been sounded in thelocalityIf this occurs,  the civil population should keepindoors, away from windows and preferably on the lower floors,so as to avoid being hit by falling shrapnel or bullets.They should stay there until they judge from the cessation of firing that the fighting is ever.      Should the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief consider that the enemy is likely todevelop an attack on the district, the air-raid warnings will&quot;be sounded and the action that normally follows will be taken.

The Government have considered whether the police or some other local authority could he authorised to soundpublic warnings at discretion if they hear anti-aircraft fire or observe an air battle going on.     Air attacks can,however, change their nature and direction so rapidly thatno local authority can possibly have the comprehensive viewof the situation which is all the time possessed byHeadquarters, Fighter Commandc      The Government would regard the sounding of independent local warnings as definitely unsafe.To sum up:   ;::he air defence of Great Britain must be controlled from Headquarters, Fighter Command., where all information is immediately received of the approach of hostileaircraft.      The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief who directsthis defence must also be responsible for bringing the civildefences into operation, including the sounding of publicwarnings.      This Officer will exercise his discretion inaccordance with the general line of policy I have indicated.He has the fullest confidence of His Majesty&apos;s Government.
