Printed for the War Cabinet, November 1939.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (G.) (39) 110.WAR CABINET.THE  BLACK-OUT.Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I VENTURE to suggest to my colleagues that when the present moon begins to wane the black-out system should be modified to a sensible degree. We know that it is not the present policy of the German Government to indulge in indis-criminate bombing in England or X FElUCC, and it is certainly not their interestto bomb any but a military objective. The bombing of military objectives can best be achieved, and probably only be achieved, by daylight or in moonlight.Should they change this policy, or should a raid be signalled, we could extinguishour lights again. It should have been possible by this time to have made arrange-ments to extinguish the street lighting on a Yellow Warning. However, so faras night bombing for the mere purpose of killing civilians is concerned, it iseasy to find London by directional bearing and the map, whether the city islighted or not. There is no need to have the &quot; rosy glow &quot; as a guide, and itwould not be a guide if it were extinguished before the raiders leave the sea. Butthere is not much in it anyway.2. There is, of course, no need to turn on the full peace-time street-lighting.There are many modified forms. The system in force in the streets of Parisis practical and effective. You can see six hundred yards. The streets are lightenough to drive about with safety, and yet much dimmer than in time of peace.3. The penalty we pay for the present methods is very heavy : First, theloss of life : Secondly, as the Secretary of State for Air has protested, the impedi-ment to munitions output; and also work at the ports/even on the west coast:Thirdly, the irritating and depressing effect on the people which is a drag upon their war-making capacity, and, because thought unreasonable, an injury to the prestige of His Majesty&apos;s Government: Fourthly, the anxieties of women and young girls in the darkened streets at night or in blaeked-out trains : Fifthly, theeffect on shopping and entertainments.I would therefore propose that as from the 1st December :  (a) Street-lighting of a dimmed and modified character shall be resumed inthe cities, towns and villages.(b) Motor cars and railway trains shall be allowed substantially more light,even at some risk.(c) The existing restrictions on blacking-out houses, to which the public haveadapted themselves, shall continue; but that vexatious prosecutionsfor minor infractions shall not be instituted. (I see in the newspapersthat a man was prosecuted for smoking a cigarette too brightly atone place, and that a woman who turned on the light to tend her babyin a fit was fined in another.)(d) The grant of these concessions should be accompanied by an effectivepropaganda continuously delivered by the broadcast, and handed out[20340]
to motorists at all refuelling stations, that on an air-raid warningall motorists should immediately stop their cars and extinguish theirlights, and that all other lights should be extinguished. SevereV examples should be made of persons who, after a warning has beensounded, show any light.4. Under these conditions we might face the chances of the next three winter months in which there is so much mist and fog. We can always revert to theexisting practice if the war flares up, or if we do anything to provoke reprisals.w. s. c.November 20, 1939.
