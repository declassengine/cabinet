(this document IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).&apos;85cCOPY NO..ISWAR.    CABINET.SUPPLIES OP FBEDING-*STUFFS AND LIVESTOCK POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1.     Livestock policy has an important bearing on the food andconsequently on the health of the nation and it is from this anglethat I have examined the paper W.P.(G)(39)81.      I should fully agreewith the suggestion in paragraph 5 that in present circumstances&quot;the Government should at once take responsihility for determining the order of priority as between the different classes of livestockshaving regard to the important national interests involved&quot;.I should also support whole-heartedly the proposition that &quot;themaintenance of the milk supply is a primary consideration and that every effort should be made to provide adequate supplies of feeding-stuffs for dairy cows&quot;.     The conclusion in paragraph 7(iii)9however, &quot;that the quantity of the principal feeding-stuffs requiredhy poultry .... must in the immediate future he reduced by 50 pei)cent.&quot;3 as against a reduction of the imported feeding-stuffsavailable for pig production by 20 per cent.^ requires very closeconsideration.2.     The food value of pig meat differs in certain important respects from that of eggs.      The egg contains high quality protein(flesh-forming food) and fat. in a very easily assimilated form.^ also contains vitamins As &quot;the disease-resisting vitamin&quot; and D9&apos;the rickets-preventing vitamin&quot;, both of which are absent from^acon altogether.     The egg also contains more iron and seven times8 touch lime3 weight for weight9 as does bacon.

3,     Furthermore,, a given amount of feeding-stuffs fed to thehen will produce twice as much protein (flesh-forming food) as thesame amount fed   to the pig, although the total energy produced(calories) is admittedly considerably lower.     The food fed to the pig is to a very great extent formed into fat, and this ought to beconsidered in conjunction with our unlimited margarine ration.4.     I suggest therefore that the allocation of feeding-stuffsto various classes of livestock should be reviewed in the firstinstance by a small committee   which should include the twoAgricultural Departments, the Ministry of Food and the Ministryof Health, I should hope that it would be possible that theMinistry of Shipping could also be represented on such a Committee,since it is desirable that the allocation of shipping space to humanas well as to animal food-stuffs^ should also be considered.- fromthe point of view of national health.w. E. E.istry of Health,&quot;tehall, S.W.1.th November, 1939.
