SECRET Medical Research Council.24.x.39.SOME   NOTES    ON   DEFENCE   AGAINST   BACTERIOLOGICAL   warfare the Reports of the special sub-committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence  (see C.I.D. Papers 1315B, 1424B and 1438B)dealt with the problem in general terms, and made certain recommen-dations that have since been implemented.     More recently, andparticularly within the last few weeks, many suggestions have beenreceived from official and unofficial sources in regard to particular methods of attack that are said to he contemplated bythe enemy.      It may be of service to consider these in a series ofbrief notes,  summarising the evidence on which some assessment canbe made of the likelihood of these methods being used,  and of their probable effect if they should in fact be tried.(A)    GENERAL    PRINCIPLESCertain general principles must be borne in mind in considering any suggested method of bacteriological warfare.(i) The one outstanding objective of bacteriological warfare,effectively and intelligently applied, would tie to start epidemicsof infective disease which would then spread far beyond theparticular locality attacked.(ii) If such spread were realised, baoteriological warfarewould be a very effective weapon for use against our civilian population, but a very unsuitable weapon for use against our armies in the field, because any epidemic would probably spread backacross the lines to the enemy&apos;s own troops.      If bacteriologicalwarfare were used in the field, an infecting agent would probablybe selected that would not cause epidemic spread.     A note is appended to this summary, dealing with the military aspect of theproblem.      The summary itself is concerned only with the use ofthis weapon against the civilian population.(iii) The mere presence of a particular bacterium or virus isnot sufficient to start an epidemic, even though it may cause acertain number of primary cases of disease.      A variety of conditions, often of the most complex kind, are required forepidemic spread, and these conditions vary from one infection toanother.      If the enemy supposed that, by the random spreading ofbacteria or viruses, he would start epidemics of the diseasescaused by them, he would be displaying an unexpected lack of knowledge and intelligence.(iv) Certain diseases, of which influenza is an example, occurperiodically in this country in an epidemic form.      They will occurwhenever conditions become suitable, whether the enemy attempts to spread them or not, because the infecting organisms concerned arealways with us.     When conditions are unsuitable they will notspread, whatever the enemy does.     Action on his part would there-fore be superfluous so far as these diseases are concerned.(v) Some epidemic diseases can be controlled more easily and effectively than others,- and war-time conditions, especiallyconditions resulting from heavy air-raiding, will render somediseases particularly difficult to control.      An intelligent enemy would select his infecting agent accordingly.

(B)  PARTICULAR METHODS OP BACTERIOLOGICAL WARFARE THAT HAVE BEENSUGGESTED.   It is perhaps natural that the spreading of bacteria orviruses.by aeroplane should have occupied a prominent place in the suggestions that have been made, particularly from unofficialsources;    but the aeroplane is, for most purposes,  a very clumsyand inefficient bacteriological instrument, because it cannotusually fulfil the essential condition of depositing the selectedinfecting agent in the right place at the right time.      Among theactual reports or suggestions that have been received are thefollowing.(1)    Bubonic Plague.      It has been reported that the enemyintend to drop from aeroplanes cages containing rats infected withplague, the cages being so constructed that they release the ratson landing.Plague,  in its ordinary bubonic form, is a disease ofrats which is spread from rat to rat and from rat to man by fleas.It assumes epidemic form in man only when men, rats and fleas arein close and frequent contact.      The social conditions in thiscountry up to the middle of the seventeenth century ensured thiscontact, and major epidemics of plague occurred periodically,including the Black Death and terminating in the Great Plague ofLondon.      Improving social conditions then reduced the frequency of contact between men, rats and fleas, and plague disappeared.It happens that we have recent evidence that existing conditionsare not such as to allow the epidemic spread of plague in man,even in the presence of plague-infected rats.     Between 1906 and1918, plague was continuously present in rats in East Anglia, but during these twelve years there were only seven certain and elevendoubtful plague deaths in man, and almost all these occurred in afew crowded and flea-infested cottages.      If a relatively wideinfection of rats caused an average of 1.5 plague deaths in manper year, we need not be greatly disturbed by the prospect of therelease of any possible number of plague-infected rats fromaeroplanes.      It is true that,  if our social conditions deterio-rated to those of 1665 or earlier, plague would spread again;    butif that happened we should suffer from a wide variety of epidemicdiseases apart altogether from enemy action.(2)    Rabies.      It has been suggested from two independentsources that Germany has planned to release from aeroplanes ratsinfected with rabies (hydrophobia;    lyssa).Hydrophobia is a natural disease of dogs, and is conveyed to man by the bites of rabid animals.      The suggestion is that dogswould become infected from the rats, and would then convey the disease to man.     We have controlled hydrophobia quite successfullyin the past by a muzzling order, and could certainly do so again.This method seems to have little to recommend it from the point ofview of an intelligent enemy.(3)    Cholera and Typhoid (Enteric) Fever.      It has beensuggested that the enemy will drop, or spray, cultures of choleraor typhoid organisms from aeroplanes, in the hope of startingepidemics of these diseases.      It is usually added that thesebacteria will be dropped into water reservoirs.

The organisms of cholera and typhoid would be sensibleones for the enemy to use, because it is quite likely that thesanitary services that at present protect us against thesediseases, and against intestinal infections in general, will suffersome dislocation in time of war.     If heavy air-raiding occurredthis dislocation might be very serious.     Moreover, we haveevacuated large numbers of our population, particularly children,from urban areas which have good water supplies and good systems of sewage disposal to rural areas where these services are oftenprimitive.     As a result of the steady improvement in our sanitaryservices the typhoid deaths in this country fell from 385 permillion living in 1876 to 5 per million living in 1931.     We shall probably be faced with a rise in the inoidence of typhoid and ofother intestinal infections towards the earlier figure, and perhapsbeyond it, apart from any deliberate action by the enemy.     If,however, the enemy could start a number of epidemics of typhoid,and perhaps of cholera, in different areas within a short space oftime, the situation might become very serious, though much could probably be done by protective vaccination combined with emergency measures of sanitary control.Spread by aeroplane would, however, be a singularlyineffective method of attempting to start epidemics of this kind.Spreading typhoid or cholera bacilli at random on the ground wouldbe most unlikely to produce any effective number of infections.There are large numbers of typhoid &quot;carriers&quot; in this country -persons who have been infected with typhoid bacilli in the past and continue to harbour them and excrete them from, their intestines.Typhoid bacilli can be cultivated from the sewage effluents fromareas where an epidemic has occurred for several years after theepidemic has ended.     These effluents, which flow into our riversand estuaries, are known to contain these bacilli in large numbers;yet, with ordinary sanitary control, no fresh cases of typhoidoccur.      It has been noted that the enemy airmen are credited withthe intention of dropping the typhoid or cholera bacilli into waterreservoirs.      This would involve low flying and accurate aim, andthe effort would probably be wasted.      It is, of course,  true thatthe successful contamination of a large piped water supply would bea most effective method of starting a major epidemic if no counter-measures could be taken, but the chlorination of water is a most effective counter-measure, and all that would be needed to defeatthis particular method of attack would be the enforcement of the continuous chlorination of all public water supplies.The danger in relation to infections of this type - andit is a very real danger - comes from enemy agents, not from enemyaeroplanes, from bacteriological sabotage, not from bacteriological&quot;warfare&quot; in the usually accepted sense.     A short note onbacteriological sabotage is appended to this summary.(4)    Anthrax.      It has been suggested that the enemy intends to drop, or spray, from aeroplanes large quantities of anthraxspores.The first thing to note about this suggestion is that it involves the sacrifice of the main advantage of the bacteriologicalweapon.     We have strong reasons for believing that, even if acertain number of primary anthrax infections could be produced,the disease would not spread.     Every year, in this country, wehave a certain number of cases of anthrax in man.     During the

period 1913-1924 there were, on the average, 62 cases a year.Such cases have always been widely scattered and there has never been any evidence of spread from man to man.As the disease will not spread in epidemic form, the efficacyof this method must be judged by attempting to compare the numberof deaths, or cases of serious illness, likely to be produced byan aeroplane spraying anthrax spores, with the number of deathsor woundings likely to be produced by an aeroplane dropping high explosive or incendiary bombs, or spraying gas.     This comparisoncan be little more than a guess, but the guess would certainly bein favour of the methods of aerial warfare hitherto practised.Anthrax, as it occurs in man in this country, is an industrial disease contracted by workers who handle hides, hair or wool,coming from infected animals.     This infected material comes from various areas in Eastern Europe and Asia where anthrax in animalsis far more common than in this country.     We have noted above thatan average of 62 cases occurred annually in this country between1912 and 1924, and that these were widely scattered among factoriesdealing with hair, wool and hides.     It is clear, therefore, thatinfected material was being handled in many different places, butthe total number of infections produced was never large.     It seems doubtful whether the concentration of anthrax spores at ground level,produced as the result of spraying these spores from a great height,would be as high, even over a small area, as the concentration in a factory dealing with infected hair or wool.     Though no definite conclusion can be justified in the absence of actual experience,it seems improbable that the lethal effect of this method of warfare would be comparable to that produced by high explosives.Some infections might well be caused, but if they were few and farbetween their only important effect would be psychological.     Theenemy might, of course, regard this effect as worth producing forits own sake.It should be noted that the above refers to anthrax in man.An assessment of the possible danger to our   livestock of an attemptto spread anthrax in cattle is a question for the Ministry ofAgriculture,The question of anthrax in animals is not, however, unconnected with that of anthrax in man, since some cases in man are of the&quot;agricultural&quot; type, that is are due to infection from sick animalsin the field instead of from hair, hides or wool in the factory.It would seem, however, that such cases are seldom numerous, exceptin Italy and certain Balkan countries.     Since many statements in regard to this particular method of bacteriological warfarehave suggested that an appalling mortality would result, both incattle and in man, from the random spreading of anthrax spores fromaeroplanes, it is worth noting that our own pasture lands are notfree from this organism at the present time, though the majority ofcases in cattle in this country occur during the winter months andare probably caused by infection from imported   foodstuffs.     Thereis at least circumstantial evidence for the view that pasture landin this country is not as favourable for the development and spread of anthrax infection as are the pastures of warmer lands.     the soil of some areas in France, particularly the Beance, Champagneand Auvergne districts, are much more heavily infected.     It wouldbe possible for the enemy to infect areas at present free,&quot; and perhaps to cause an appreciable increase in infections in cattle;but suggestions that he could produce a heavy mortality in man, orcreate a hitherto unknown danger in this country or in France, arenot in accord with the facts.

(5)     Psittacosis.     It has been suggested that the enemy willdrop, or spray, from aeroplanes the virus of psittacosis,Here again, the enemy would be throwing away the main advantageof the weapon he was employing.     Psittacosis is a natural diseaseof birds, particularly of birds of the parrot family, and isconveyed to man from infected birds.     In man it causes a diseaseof the pneumonic type.     There are many records of human cases ofpsittacosis.     None have been followed &quot;by epidemic spread.     Therehave in some instances been a few secondary cases, but these have always been confined to persons living in the same house, or inclose and frequent contact with the patient.Nor is it likely that any widespread epidemic could be causedamong birds in this country, from which man might be infected.     Theonly one of our native birds that is known to suffer naturally fromthis disease is the fulmar petrel, and this bird is confined to ourNorth, North-East, and North-West coasts, and does not come intoclose contact with man except in a few of its major breeding places,As a primary lethal agent, psittacosis virus might prove more effective than anthrax spores.     The frequency with which researchworkers who have studied this disease have become infected with itsuggests that relatively small doses of the virus would be adequate.In general, however, it seems probable that the comments on anthraxin (4) above are applicable, with minor modifications, topsittacosis.(6) Tularaemia.    It has been suggested that the enemy intends to drop from aeroplanes the organism of tularaemia.Tularaemia is a disease which occurs in certain rodents,chiefly ground-squirrels and jack-rabbits in the western part ofthe United States and of Canada.     It has also been reported from japan, Norway and Russia,     The disease is probably conveyed fromone animal to another by biting insects, especially ticks,     Manis infected from.animals under natural conditions, either by thebites of ticks, by biting flies, particularly horse-files, or bydressing the skins of wild rabbits.     The incidence in man is,however, confined mainly to those who are brought into close contact with wild animals, or their bodies - trappers, poultrymen,or butchers.     It does not seem to occur in epidemic form, nor arelarge numbers of the population affected.     In the western statesof America 420 cases in man were reported between 1914, when the disease was recognised, and 1930,     It is probable that many casesoccurred which were not diagnosed, particularly in the earlier years;but it is clear that widespread infection may occur among rodentswithout any large number of human infections.Like psittacosis, tularaemia would seem to be highly infectivefor man under conditions favourable for transfer, since manylaboratory workers who have studied this disease have becomeinfected.     Man is probably infected through the skin, or throughthe conjunctiva, when not infected by the bite of an insect.It is impossible to foretell how many primary infections, ifany, would be caused by spraying this organism from aeroplanes,though, for the reasons considered in relation to anthrax andpsittacosis, it seems unlikely that they would be very numerous.

Even if a certain number occurred there is little likelihood thatthe disease would spread,     There is no evidence of direct crossinfection from man to man;    and the American evidence indicates that, even if widespread infection could be produced among rabbitsor other rodents, the number of human infections resulting fromthis would not be large.(7)     Pneumonic Plague.     It has been suggested that plaguebacilli might be sprayed from aeroplanes with the intention of starting an epidemic of pneumonic plague.This form of plague differs from the ordinary bubonic plagueconsidered in (1) above, in being transferred from man to man by direct contact.     It is also an extremely fatal form of the disease.So far as the production of primary infections is concerned, theproblem is the same as that discussed in regard to anthrax.     Itseems unlikely that the concentration of plague bacilli at groundlevel following their dissemination from great heights will besufficient to cause many cases of the disease.     Subject to thesame reservation that the answer can be little more than a guessin the absence of practical experience, the likelihood would appearto be that no large numbers of infections would be produced.In regard to epidemic spread, the chances would seem to bestill more against the enemy.     Within recent history, epidemicsof pneumonic plague have been mainly confined to countries in whichprimitive conditions of life, associated with extreme cold, resultin gross overcrowding in small huts or tents.     Thus there havebeen epidemics in North China, Manchuria, Transbaikalia and theKirghiz Steppes.     In these countries bubonic plague tends to occur in the summer and pneumonic plague in the winter.     There seemslittle likelihood that conditions favourable to the spread ofpneumonic plague would occur in this country.(8)     Typhus.     It has been suggested that the enemy intends to drop from aeroplanes the organism that causes typhus fever.Typhus is a louse-borne disease, and one version of the enemy&apos;transaction is that he will drop infected lice.     The disease is conveyedfrom man to man by the body louse.     For typhus to spread inepidemic form there must be a heavy infestation of a high proportionof the population with body lice (not head lice).      It ischaracteristically a disease of armies in the field, in those areas where it is prevalent,  or of civilian populations living under conditions of extreme&apos;squalore      Our civilian population is, atthe present time, relatively free from body lice;, so that typhuswould certainly not spread among us.      It does not seem likely thatour people will attain a degree of louse infestation adequate toallow any considerable spread of this disease if our social services can be maintained at any reasonable level.In regard to primary infections,  resulting directly from the dropping of the organism from aeroplanes, the   position iscomparable to that of psittacosis or tularaemia, since here againthere have been many, though not so many, accidental laboratoryinfections and it seems clear that infection takes place with somereadiness through the skincThe dropping of infected lice seems no more likely to be effective than the dropping of the infecting organism.     The louse

does not survive for long apart from a man on whom it can feed, and very few of the lice dropped from an aeroplane would be likely toland in a situation convenient to themselves.     The rest would;    perish ineffectively.(9)     Yellow fever.     It has been suggested that the enemyintends to release firom aeroplanes mosquitoes infected with yellowfever.This suggestion, like so many others, ignores our knowledgeof the complex biological factors concerned in the spread ofinfective disease.     Yellow fever is a disease of certain tropicaland sub-tropical countries, spread from man to man by m6gQBitoeey andparticularly by a species known as Agdes aegypti.     Although itseems probable that other species of mosquitoes may be concerned as vectors In some areas, there is no reason to believe that wehave suitable insect vectors in this country.     It is altogetherunlikely that the occurrence of a few human cases would be followedby any epidemic spread.How many of the infected mosquitoes that might be released from an aeroplane would bite and infect a human being during theirshort period of life it is impossible to say;   but the odds against any considerable number of infections occurring would seem to be extremely high.(10)     Foot-and-Mouth Disease.     As a contrast to the examplesconsidered above, mention may be made of a suggested method ofbacteriological attack by enemy aeroplanes where everything is inthe enemyTs favour, and success would almost certainly be achieved.It concerns a disease of animals, not of man, but it serves as afurther illustration of the general principles involved.Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly infectious virus diseaseof cattle, and of certain other livestock.     Our cattle are highlysusceptible to this disease;   and we keep it under control only byslaughtering infected animals and healthy animals that are knownto have been in contact with them.     This slaughter policy could hardly be applied on the widest scale in war time on account ofits effect on our milk supply.     The disease spreads rapidly.The random spraying of pastures would almost certainly be effective in starting multiple foci of infection.     If epidemicswere started in many parts of the country within a short time the disease would rapidly get beyond control.     The death rate wouldbe low, but the effect on our milk and food supplies would be serious.SUPPLEMENTARY    NOTE    ON   BACTERIOLOGICAL   SABOTAGE   BY   ENEMYAGENTSThis question was considered in some detail in the Reportsof the Sub-Committee on Bacteriological Warfare.     It will suffice to note that an enemy agent, armed with cultures of bacteria orviruses which would occupy a very small bulk, could start outbreaks of infection without great difficulty, sinoe he could deposit hismaterial in the most effective place.     He could, for instance,infect bread, cakes, fruit, milk, etc., with typhoid bacilli, or

with ether organisms causing intestinal infections.     Any food would&apos;serve, so long as it was not subjected to further cooking before being eaten.     The infection of shallow wells used for the supply ofdrinking water would be another possibility, since routinechlorination of such water would be extremely difficult.     In thecase of diseases caused by inhalation, the spraying of bacteria orviruses in a relatively small space, such as a hall or tube station,would result in a far higher concentration than would the sprayingof the same material from a great height in the open air;   but theact of spraying would be more difficult, and more open to detectionthan would the contamination of foodstuffs.It is clearly of the greatest importance that the Emergencypublic Health Laboratory Service, which was set up by the medical research Council on instructions from the Committee of ImperialDefence to ensure the early diagnosis of epidemics, whether dueto enemy action or arising from other causes, should be maintained in a high state of efficiency:   and that local health authoritiesshould maintain a staff of Medical Officers and Inspectors sufficientto keep a close and continuous watch on the incidence of infectivedisease, in addition to fulfilling the many other duties that war conditions will impose on them.     The essential factor in the effective control of epidemics is immediate action as soon as thefirst cases occur, and this entails constant vigilance.SUPPLEMENTARY    NOTE    ON   SOME   MILITARY   ASPECTS    OF   BACTERIOLOGICALWARFAREIt has been noted above that bacteriological warfare, with theobject of starting epidemics of infective disease,  is unlikely tobe used as a weapon against our armies in the field, because suchepidemics would probably spread to the enemy&apos;s own troops.     as pointed out in previous reports, a possible exception might befound in a disease to which our troops were susceptible, but against which the enemy might protect his own by some form ofimmunization.     Our troops will, however, be protected againsttyphoid and small-pox, two diseases that may readily spread amongarmies in the field and against which vaccination is known to be effective.     It would be a rash experiment for the enemy to attempta plan of this type, using some other infecting organism, and avaccine that had not actually been tried out under field conditions.It is never possible to foretell, apart from such experience, howeffective a particular type of vaccination will be.A more likely method,  if this weapon were employed at all,would be the selection of an organism that would cause primaryinfections but would not tend to spread.     Reasons have been given above for the conclusion that this method, by itself, would probablybe far less lethal than shells, bullets, or gas.&apos;There remains, however, the possibility of combining the useQf shells and bullets with the use of bacteria0     If theseProjectiles could be effectively contaminated with bacteria of asuitable kind, the enemy might be able to increase considerablythe death rate among the wounded, and particularly among thej-ightly wounded.     This would involve the employment of bacterialspores sufficiently heat-resistant to withstand the heat generatedcoring the explosion of a shell, or the firing of a bullet,against some spore-bearing bacilli,  such as the tetanus bacillus,-e are protected with an effective agent for treatment in the

corresponding antitoxin.     Whether other spore-hearing organisms,such as anthrax, would be effective if used in this way it isimpossible to say.It must again be remembered that, just as epidemics of diseaseamong the civilian population will occur apart from deliberate enemy action, so serious wound infections will occur apart from anyintentional contamination of bullets or shells.     The question is whether this method would greatly increase the number of suchinfections.     It would be desirable to obtain, from the appropriatetechnical experts, further information on certain of the physicalfactors concerned, particularly on the temperature attained byexploding shells, or travelling bullets, and its duration.It will be clear that this supplementary note, at least so faras high explosives are concerned, is applicable to air raids on the civilian population.As with any other untried method of warfare, it is impossibleto do more than guess at the potentialities of the bacteriologioalweapon until it has been experienced.     The above notes are no morethan an attempt to indicate which of the methods that have actually been suggested seem likely to be ineffective, and which seem tooffer the enemy some chance of successful attack.Postscript:   Botulinus toxin.A suggestion has recently been made that the enemy might sprayfrom aeroplanes the toxin produced by an organism known asClostridium botulinum.This toxin, when taken into the body through the mouth, causesthe very fatal disease known as botulism.     The first point to note in regard to this suggestion is that it is not, in the ordinarysense of the term, an example of bacteriological warfare, but of chemical warfare.     The toxin is a non-living product of thebacterium.      It does not cause an infection, but death frompoisoning.     This suggestion is strictly comparable to othersthat have been made in regard to spraying arsenic, or otherchemical poisons.Botulinum toxin, used intelligently, would provide the enemywith a highly effective weapon, since it is fatal in minute doses;hut here again we find the aeroplane obsession.     What proportionof toxin, sprayed from aeroplanes, would find its way into themouths of human beings?     It seems clear that by far the greaterpart of a reagent that would be more troublesome to prepare than&apos;most other available poisons would be wasted.     An enemy agent,on the other hand, armed with relatively small amounts of toxin,could use it effectively by introducing it into foodstuffs.There would, of course, be no spread of disease beyond those whoconsumed the poisoned food, but the mortality among thoseconsuming it would be high.
