-C. t^;    37SIIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT) ,secret.P.(G)(39) 109.Copy No.     /JCABINETBURMA: THE CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIVEMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary oT State for Burma.Id my fifth periodical Report on Burma,(No. V/.P. (R) (39)86) , I mentioned that the premier, onbehalf of the whole Council of Ministers, had pressed the Governor on the 14th November to elucidate thestatement that :he made on 7th November with the authorityof His Majesty&apos;s Government (see W.P.(G)(39) 66) withparticular reference to the question of the attainment byBurma of &quot;Dominion status&quot;; and at the same time he madepointed allusion to the fact that, in my explanation inthe House of Lords on the same day that &quot;Dominion status&quot;to-day, in the light of the Statute of Westminster,  is inno way different from Dominion status as defined in 1926,I referred only to India and not to Burma.Specific application of the phrase &quot;dominion status&quot; to Burma has hitherto been studiously avoided,hut paragraph XXIV of the Instrument of Instructions tothe Governor of Burma instructs him so to &quot;exercise the trust which We have reposed in him that the partnership between Burma and the United Kingdom within Our Empiremay be furthered to the end that Burma may attain its dueplace among Our Dominions&quot;.    The same words, with thesubstitution of &quot;India&quot; for &quot;Burma&quot;, are used inparagraph XVI of the Instrument of Instructions to theGovernor-General of India; and as &quot;Dominion status&quot; hasbeen unequivocally stated to be the objective for India,

- 2 -i think that, now that, we are faced with the directquestion whether or not Dominion status is also the objective for Surma, there is no option but to sayplainly that it is.    The Governor of Burma is veryemphatic in a telegram received from him on the 18thNovember as to the extreme and immediate danger of anyother course.Whatever may have been the origin of the phrase&quot;Dominion status&quot;, it can now, as i understand it, beregarded only as a convenient way of indicating what isset out in full in the Report of the Inter-imperial relations Committee of the Imperial Conference of 1925.asa definition of the &quot;position and mutual relation&quot; ofGreat Britain and the Dominions, and is interpretableonly by reference to that statement, viz.  &quot;they areautonomous Communities within the British Empire, equalin status, in no way subordinate one to another in anyaspect of their domestic or external affairs, thoughunited by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freelyassociated as Members of the British Commonwealth ofNations&quot;.    This was accepted in 1926 as a statement of constitutional tact (i.e. apart from questions of constitutional form) and is a statement of the factexisting to-day in relation to the countries (exceptNewfoundland) which then accepted the declaration.Though there are in this statement of fact certainimplications, to which I will allude later, which mayafford ground for misgiving whether this formula may everbe found to be true, in every respect, of Burma, it doesnot seem to me that it contains any implication which need render it inapplicable as a statement of the objective which is possible of attainment by Burma, if an

- 3 -378admission that &quot;Dominion status&quot;  is the objective were followed by a question as to what that phrase means.Apart from the pledge implicit in the paragraph ofthe Burma Instrument of Instructions which I have quoted,the only pledge which has been given to Burma is that given in a statement by the Secretary of State for india on the 20th January 1931 and reaffirmed by the Governor inhis statement of 7th November, the last words of which are&quot;and that the constitutional objective after Separationwill remain the progressive realisation of responsible government in Burma as an integral part of the Empire&quot;.These words are a repetition, in relation to Burma, of thedeclaration made in August 1917 in relation to India -what is known as the &quot;Montagu Declaration&quot; - andsubsequently incorporated as the Preamble to the Act of1919; that Declaration defines the goal of British policy as &quot;the gradual development of self-governing institutions,with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the BritishEmpire&quot;.In 1929 the Viceroy was &quot;authorised on behalf ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to state clearly that, in their judgment, it is implicit in the Declaration of 1917 thatthe natural issue of India&apos;s constitutional progress, as there contemplated, is the attainment of Dominion status&quot;.If that is the implication of the words of the1917 declaration in relation to India, can the same wordsbear any other implication in relation tr Burma?     Myconclusion is that they cannot; and that, as any freshsynonym for the phrase &quot;Dominion status&quot; would inevitably be viewed with the gravest suspicion, we must admit

&quot;Dominion status&quot; to be the objective of Burma just as ithas been declared to be that for India.Nevertheless, certain misgivings will inevitably be felt about this conclusion, and.I think that theyderive from two considerations.The first is uncertainty as to what is to be readinto the words in the Balfour Declaration of 1926 &quot;equalin status&quot; and the consideration that doubts as to thepossibility (and consequently as to the unwisdom of holding out any hope) that Burma will ever be equal instatus with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and SouthAfrica are due to some degree of -confusion of &apos; status&apos;with &quot;importance&apos;.   No one, of course, would suggest thatBurma can ever hope to be of equal intrinsic importancein the Empire with Great Britain or even with India, andit may be observed that it is the great size and power ofIndia, in fact, her intrinsic importance, which makes it probable that, when India is fully autonomous and in no way subordinate to His hajesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom in any aspect of India&apos;s domestic or external affairs, she will be accepted as of an equal standing withany other community in the Empire.   On the other hand,  itis hardly to be suggested that these words in theDeclaration of 1926 meant that Great Britain and each ofthe Dominions to which the Declaration was directed were then, or are now of equal intrinsic importance.    It seemsto me that since they do not mean &quot;equal in importance&quot;the words &quot;equal in status&quot;  in the Declaration of 1926have two implications, of which the first is the legal and logical consequence of the other attributes stated in-&quot;elation to the communities in question, namely that theyare autonomous, and in no way subordinate one to another

- 5 -in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs; for if a country or a community is autonomous and in no waysubordinate to another in any aspect of its domestic orexternal affairs, then any other country that wishes tohave relations with it or treat v*ith it in any connectionmust treat with it as an equal, just as Great Britaintreats with, for example. Thailand, Burma1s neighbour, asequal in status, though not admitting for a moment thatThailand is of the same intrinsic importance as GreatBritain.   There is nothing in this implication which wouldbe inapplicable to Burma whan she attains full responsibleself-government.The second ground for hesitating to admit that&quot;Dominion status&quot; as interpreted in the light of the 1926declaration is the goal for Burma is to be found, I think,in the second implication of the words &quot;equal in status&quot;which seem to me in their context to indicate recognition by the countries in the Empire which adopted this declaration that each of them acknowledges the other to bea partner with it in the   British Commonwealth of Nations&quot;within which they have certain mutual obligations of consultation and co-operation in matters of common concern.Insofar as there is a partnership (the members of which areinevitably equal one with the other though some may besenior partners and others junior partners) it is impossiblefor Great Britain alone, however much Great Britain may desire it (c.f. the Viceroy&apos;s statement of 1st November1929) , to promise any other country that all the partnerswill accept that other country to partnership, and, insofar as the original partnership constitutes a close corporationdescribed as the &quot;British Commonwealth of Nations&quot;, it isnot possible for His Lajesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom to promise Burma, or India for that matter, that it

will be admitted by the other partners to equal membership of that close corporation.    There is room for doubt there -fore whether Burma or India having attained full self-government and thereby equality of status in the legalsense will thereupon be accepted by the other partners as of equal status in a wider sense.But whatever mental reservations may, for thereasons suggested in the last paragraph, have to be madeas to the possible attitude of the other Dominions to burma, or India, at some future date when these twocountries attain complete self-government, it seems to methat there can be no doubt that when, by the gradualdevelopment of self-governing institutions, they have become autonomous and are no longer subordinate to anyother country in the Empire in respect of any aspect oftheir domestic or external affairs, they will be equal instatus in the legal and logical sense of those words andwill, to put it shortly, have attained &quot;Dominion status&quot;,I propose, therefore, if my colleagues concur, toauthorise the Governor of Burma to say in as formal a manner as may be required that the constitutional objectivefor Burma, as for India, is the attainment of dominion status and I append the draft of a statement to this effect; but I should propose also that, unless he sees anyinsuperable objection in the present temper of political opinion in Burma, he should take the opportunity toemphasise by informal observations to his Ministers that progress towards the development of full self-governmentdepends on the success with which Burmans use the opportunities for proving their capacity which have beenafforded to them by the Government of Burma Act, 1935, thatthere are no short cuts, and that it is therefore not

-   7 -possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to answer thequestion (which has been asked of the Governor) when the goal will be attained or to lay down a time-table forprogress through each successive stage towards it.Z.BURMA OFFICE 5    S..W.   1.20th November 1933.

Draft of statement to bo made by the Governor of Burma.In the statement which, with the full authority of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, I made on 7th November, I said thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government re-affirm the declaration made bythe Secretary of State for India on 20th January, 1931.That declaration affirmed that the constitutional objectivefor Burma after separation from India &quot;will remain the progressive realisation of responsible government in Burmaas an integral part of the Empire&quot;.This definition of the constitutional objective forseparated Burma is in the same words as were used in August .1917, in what is known as the Montagu Declaration, inrelation to India - 11 the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressiverealisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire&quot;.On 1st November 1929 the Governor General of India was authorised on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to stateclearly that in their judgment it is implicit.in thedeclaration of 1917 that the natural issue of India&apos;constitutional progress, as there contemplated,  is the attainment of Dominion status.I am now,  in my turn, as Governor of Burma, authorisedon behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to state that in their judgment the natural issue of Burma&apos;s constitutional progress, through the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in Burma, is the attainment ofDominion status.
