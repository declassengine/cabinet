(This Document is the Property 01* His Britannic Majesty1 s^ Government)secret.P.(G)(39)  53.Copy No.-   ^war cabinet.eviousinference:Wi.(39)47th Con-lusions,nuteINDIA and THE TvaHMemorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate for the information of the WarCabinet telegrams which I have received from theViceroy since the matter was last under consideration.It will be observed that the Viceroy is anxious for an assurance that he will receive full support in any measures which may prove necessary as the result of the refusal of the Congress to participate further in thegovernment of the provinces and to co-operate in warmeasures.   Such measures might include the RevolutionaryMovements Ordinance which was approved by the Cabinet onthe 27th October 1937 (see Cabinet Conclusions 59(37))on the understanding that if the occasion arose thematter would be brought before the Cabinet again beforethe issue of the Ordinance was finally approved.    I have little doubt that sooner or later drastic action againstthe Congress and its supporters will become necesoary.and the Cabinet will no doubt wish therefore to review the situation as it now presents itself to us.When Parliament accepted Dominion Status as the goal which they held in view for India it was generallyassumed that the journey would be a long one and therewas, I think, a general feeling among those who werecaught up in the years of investigation and discussion which culminated in the Government of India Act of 1935

that sufficient unto the day was the evil thereof.   Theeffect of the outbreak of war, however, has been to bringus hard up against the implications of Dominion Statusfor India, for the immediate demand now made by theCongress is for a definite promise of freedom at the endof the war and some immediate measure securing to theleaders of the political parties in India some share atleast in the Central Government.   We are, therefore,faced with a choice of evils, namely, either to go agreat deal further than we have hitherto felt able to dotowards satisfying the Congress claims, or, alternatively,to take over the government of the country in the face of congress opposition.   We thus find ourselves on the hornsof an uncomfortable dilemma, for there is no course opento us which is not necessarily attended by gravedisadvantages.Let me touch first upon the probable consequences of our taking over the government of the country facedwith the opposition of the Congress.    It may be argued that the heart of India is with us in our struggle againstGermany; that the war, with its demand for jute and other raw materials, will bring profit to the Indian peasant,who will be disinclined to jeopardise his improvingprosperity by joining in a prolonged and riotousagitation; and that the edge of political agitation will therefore to a large extent be blunted.    There may be something in such arguments, though I fear that the deduction drawn from them is likely to prove in the longrun to be unduly optimistic.    It is certainly true that theCongress Ministers are despondent, and though the impressionHUch I derive from the reports coming in from the

Governors is that they and the Right Wing of the Congresswill endeavour to maintain an attitude of neutrality, fewreally seem to believe that they will be able to do so for long.   The probability is, therefore, that we shall find ourselves faced with a steadily increasing volume ofagitation, culminating in strikes, attempts at sabotageand civil disobedience, possibly on a large scale.   an immense strain will be imposed on the Services andparticularly on the police; the Indian members of all services will be placed in an almost intolerable position;troops will undoubtedly have to be called in from time totime to suppress lawlessness; and bitterness will steadilygrow.     Th^ most of this will be made in neutral countries and particularly in the United States ofAmerica, where the difficulties due to the communaldivisions in India are not properly understood and areconsequently ignored.    Statements such as that made byMr. Attlee and Mr. Greenwood on Saturday to the effectthat the Indian people are entitled now to the opportunityfor full and responsible co-operation with the Governmentof India and that this co-operation ought to be accompaniedby the knowledge that the downfall of dictatorship inEurope will herald the day of India&apos;s freedom, will be seized on and have already had a most mischievous effect in India.    It is easy to imagine the propaganda valuefrom the point of view of our enemies of statements ofthis kind.I now turn to the other horn of our dilemma:namely, the alternative of going a great deal furthertowards meeting the claims of the Congress than we havehitherto contemplated.    We have actually offered themimmediate co-operation in the conduct of the war by means

of a broadly-based consultative body representative of thevarious political parties and communities and we have saidthat at the end of the war we will be willing to consider in consultation with them any modifications of particularfeatures of the federal plan embodied in the Act of 1935that may seem desirable.   These offers have been rejected as worthless and in their place the demand is for animmediate and effective share in the Central Governmentand a promise of freedom to devise their own constitutionwithout external interference at the end of the war.If it is thought that we must at all costsendeavour to avoid a serious break with the Congress, thequestion for decision becomes this:   How far could we contemplate going in the above directions?   A scheme for bringing the political leaders into the Central government without any necessity for an amendment of the ConstitutionAct has been submitted to the Viceroy and myself for our consideration by Sir Muhammad Zafrullah Khan, the MoslemMember of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council.    Briefly, thescheme proposes that the Executive Council should been larged and should consist of nine members, of whomthree should be persons with ten years&apos;  service under theCrown in India, thus fulfilling the statutory requirement.Of these three, one should replace the Commander-in-Chiefas Civilian Member in charge of Defence, and the other twoshould hold&apos;the portfolios of Home Affairs and Finance.Of the remaining six vacancies, three should be filled bythe Governor-General from a panel of nine names to besubmitted by the Congress and the allied Hindu parties;one from a panel of three to be submitted by the All&quot;-India Moslem League, and two by the Governor-General in-]is discretion, one of whom the author contemplates would

9 0be a Moslem and one a representative of one of the otherminorities or a non-Congress Hindu.   Sir Zafrullah Khanmakes two postulates:    (1) that the political members ofthe new Executive Council should undertake not to pressdifferences in Council to the point of resignation; and(2) that they would guarantee the support of their followers in the Legislature for any action which they took as members of the Government.    I should myself doubtvery much whether these undertakings would be given, or,if they were, whether they would stand the test of experience.    What the Congress really desire is controlof Defence and of Finance and it is easy to imagine the sort of controversies which would arise within aGovernment so constituted over questions of this kind.So far as the future Constitution is concerned,the demand of the Congress has now been defined byMr. Gandhi in the following words:&quot;What Congress wants is the clearest possibleacceptance of the fact that India is to be treatedas an independent nation.    What Congress wants iseasy enough to give if the will is there.    It isfor a constituent assembly to decide whetherIndia is ready for Dominion Status or not.Congress will safeguard the rights of everyminority so long as they do not advance claimsinconsistent with India&apos;s independence.&quot;He added that he missed th^ will to accept these thingsin the statement issued by the Viceroy.    If we are toassume that this is the last word which Congress has tosay, there can be no room for compromise, and I am therefore reluctantly driven to the conclusion that we&apos;have no option but to take up the challenge which has been

23rd October 1939.issued by the Congress and to take over the governmentin the eight provinces in which Congress Ministries areat present functioning, with the inevitable corollarythat should attempts be made, whether by the Congress orby any other party to frustrate by speech or act the warefforts of the Government of India and the Governors andthe orderly government of the country, those attemptswill be suppressed, if necessary by the use of force.The attitude of the Moslems is not yet clear;but it seems likely that they will give us general support.Z.INDIA OFFICE,S.W.1.

SecretTelegram from Viceroy dated 22nd October 1939.2367-private and personal.    I understand that bothWorking Committees of Congress and Moslem League meet to-day, Sunday, 22nd-,   As regards the former, there are prettydefinite indications that they may contemplate an immediatebreak though I have nothing positive to go on.   as regardsthe latter, Sikander this morning reported confidentiallythat Jinnah had certain points on which he was anxious tobe reassured.   These appear to be principally (a) thatthe phrase &quot;Details of the plan&quot; in paragraph 11 of thestatement does not qualify phrase &quot;scheme of the Act&quot;  inparagraph 12.    In other words, if it should be made clearthat these paragraphs should be read together and that what His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate is that thescheme of the Act will be open to modification at the endof the war in the light of Indian views,    (b) That itshould be stated, still more specifically than in thestatement, that our intention is that the interests of minorities will be fully safeguarded in any constitutionalmodification that may take place and that minorities willbe fully consulted in connection with any change and thatno change should be made save with the agreement of theparties.3.        I have already put the first of these points to you in my private and personal telegram 2307-3 of October 17th.I am sure it is of indispensable importance to clear it,and the debate is the obvious place.   As regards thesecond, I suspect that what Jinnah would really like is afrank acceptance of the principle that any minority is tooe entitled to hold up progress completely.   An assurancein that crude form is clearly out of the question.   But I

would see advantage in drawing pointed attention in the debate to the assurances to minorities contained in theStatement that full weight would be given to their views and their interests in any modification that may becontemplated and to the fact that the essential thing isagreement between Indians themselves and that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are anxious now, as in the past, todo anything possible to assist in achieving that agreement which must be pre-condition of constitutional progress.4.        I think further that it would be worth emphasisingin the debate: firstly, that we are already formallycommitted, to Dominion Status and that we had again re-asserted that as our objective; secondly that itsattainment must depend on the amount of agreement and confidence between the various Indian parties; thirdly,that we have made it clear that the scheme of politicaladvance will be reconsidered after the war with a view tothe attainment of our objective; fourthly it is no goodburking the difficulties.    It might well be desirable tobring these latter out in some detail.5.        I do not at all now feel optimistic as to thedevelopment of the position.    I think that there is agood chance of maintaining normal government in Assam,possibly the North-West Frontier province (sikander isalive to the importance of this) and Sind, as well as inthe Punjab and Bengal.    I see little prospect of avoiding  Section 93 situation possibly in the immediate future in the remaining six provinces.    I am clear that, .as Ihave indicated to you on various occasions in the past,if there is a Section 93 situation, it must be veryresolutely handled from the start.   That the- CongressGovernments will quit office with great reluctance, I havedoubt.   But the demand with which we are now confronted

by Congress is one of fundamental importance which couldnot in my judgment have been avoided by any adjustments of machinery at the Centre or the like.   Declaration of freedom or independence raises widest issues in relationto connection between India and Great Britain, and now that demand has been made, no tinkerings with constitut-ional structure, e.g. by expanding my Council or the likewould, I feel certain, have met the case.   You are fully aware on the other hand of intensity of communal feeling,the claims of minorities from Moslems downward and thecomplication presented by the existence of the mdian States.The Princes and minorities alike will of course pay lipservice to freedom and independence as ideals and I shallnot be in the least surprised if the Moslem League stressthis by way of asserting their patriotism in anymanifesto they may issue.   But it is, I am certain,essential to safeguard their interests and the type ofsafeguards which both Moslems and princes want is quiteincompatible with any relinquishment of our control orour interest in the country.    It is relevant too that the implications of &quot;freedom&quot; in terms of Great Britain&apos;scontinued active participation in the defence of India,do not appear to have been faced from parliamentary pointof view.    Its implications in regard to commercialdiscrimination and the safeguarding of India&apos;s financialliabilities and of British capital already sunk here are obvious, though I recognise the tactical objections toany undue stressing of those issues in the debate.6.      It would be unwise for us to under-estimate the probability of. trouble of a widespread and serious naturein the provinces in which a Section 93 situation arises,and I have not failed to make clear in my past telegrams

now anxious I have been on all grounds to avoid departingiron; the normal - conditions oi government.   But pressurelooks like being too strong for us, and, if it is, I feelcertain that I can look for fullest support from you andfrom the Cabinet in whatever measures may be necessary tohold a situation which we all of us would gladly haveavoided, out which we are left with no choice but toaccept.7.        The publicity aspect of a break is of course ofimportance.    Is there any further material which you wouldlike from me in connection with it?   I take it that consideration has already been given to reactions inAmerica, and trust you will be able to assist me.there.It is of value that in Lothian we have someone asAmbassador with full Indian background.8.        I propose if you agree to let the Governors know that in the event of a break they can look for thefullest support from you and from me.    I have had thesituation under the closest review with them, and I thinkthat we are prepared.    In the event of a break there willbe a great deal to be said for picking up at once the realbad characters of the type of professional revolutionaryagitator, but for distinguishing so far as possible andfor as long as possible between them and genuine and moreconservative Congress leaders and supporters.   But I fear that leaders may feel bound to put themselves within the penalty of the law without much delay.

secretTelegram from Viceroy dated 22nd October 19392368-private and personal,   please see my private and personal telegram 2567-8 of to-day.    I think the gravityWith which I have throughout regarded a possible break(and I know that my view has been shared by you) willhave been sufficiently clear from our telegraphic correspondence over the past six weeks; and I have nodoubt that the Cabinet fully appreciate the position.At the same time, it seems to me well that at this juncture opportunity should again if you think fit betaken to put before them a considered expression of my view with, I should hope., your support.   I have not theleast doubt that we can both of us look for theircomplete backing in anything that falls to be done: andthe issues that face us are of such a nature that,failing a climb down by Congress, any escape from them is not very obvious.   But I am naturally very concerned that the Cabinet should not, once we get into thiscampaign, either feel that so far as information supplied by me is concerned they had not been fully primed or that I had not made fully obvious my own sense of the gravity of the conflict which may ensue; and that if we.;do go into this business we should go into it with theintention of standing firm.   It is of course entirely amatter for you to judge; but you may think it worth while to let them see my private and personal telegram 2367-Sof October 22nd or relevant extracts from it.
