Draft Statement to be made bjr the Prime Minister(21st November, 1959)7&quot; .The house will be aware that during the lasth   days upwards of     a   ships,    as   of which were neutrals *were sunk, unhappily with very serious loss of life., by german mines.    The Hague Convention to which Germany isa party and which she announced her intention ofobserving as recently as 17th September last providesthat when anchored, mines are used every possibleprecaution must be taken for the security of peacefulnavigation.    In particular the danger zone must be notified, as soon as military exigencies permit once the mines cease to be under observation by those who laidthem.    If unanchored mines are used they must becomeharmless one hour at most after those who laid them have lost control over them.None of these provisions has been observed by theGerman Government in causing to be laid the mines whichoccasioned the losses I have mentioned, and this freshoutrage is only the culmination of a series of violations of instruments to which Germany had set her hand.    I need only recall the sinking of the &quot;Athenia&quot; with the lossof 112 lives and the subsequent destruction of British,Allied and neutral vessels by mine., torpedos or gunfire,often without warning, and,, to an increasing extent, witha complete disregard of the rules laid down in theSubmarine Protocol or of the most elementary dictatesof humanity.    It is estimated that the number of civilianlives lost in these illegal operations already exceeds 500.&quot; Latest figures to be inserted.

His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared toallow these methods of conducting warfare to continue without retaliation.    They are now in consultation withthe Governments associated with them as to the natureof the steps to he taken and I shall inform the Houseof our decisions at the earliest possible moment.
