C. L,THE STOPPAGE OF GERMAN EXPORTSaMemorandum.- by the minister without Portfolio.I0    HISTORICAL^In the Napoleonic Wars this c country, in retaliation!for Napoleon1s Berlin and Milan decrees, built up a systemef economic pressure which proved to be one of the decisive&quot;Influence of Sea Power on the French Revolution and Empire&quot;:-&quot;At the same time? while not denying the rightof neutrals to trade with ports not blockaded,every restriction that could be placed upon such-trade by stringent,  or even forced, interpretation of international law was rigorously imposed by aNavy whose power was irresistible&quot;,,2, The next major war was in the Crimea,,      The economicfaster was of comparatively small importance in a war against russia, a country which was almost wholly self-supp ,-rtin.g,and many concessions-were made to neutral opinions.     At thePeaoe Conference in 1056 L-ord--Clarendon, the Foreign Secretary,wrote to Lord palmerston as follows&quot;It is quite clear that we can never againre-establish our ancient doctrine respectingneutrals, and that we must in any future waradhere to the exception to our rule which weadmitted at the beginning of the present war,under pain of having all mankind against us&quot;0It was this letter which induced the Cabinet of that day toadopt the declaration of Paris, 1856, Article 2 of which declares that &quot;the neutral flag covers enemy goods, with the exceptionof contraband of war&quot;.      That means that enemy exports to overseas countries, so long as they are carried in neutral98.&quot;WAR CABINET.factors in the ultimate victory,Tn qu^te Mahan&apos;s

shiPs, cannot be interfered witru     The Declaration of Pariswas not subject to ratification and conseouently carne intoforce without being 2*ati!:?ie&amp;o     It was not signed by therepresentative of the United States of America on the groundthat it did not go far enough in weakening belligerentrights at sea,3,        Fifty years elapsedo     We proceeded to weaken stillfurther our belligerent rights, firstly at The Hague Conferen-ces and secondly by the Declaration of London which, however,owing to the opposition of the House of Lords, was neverratifiedo     When war broke out in 1914, we very soon foundthat our economic pressure on Germany was being weakened bythe deliberate blunting of our principal offensive weapanin times of peacec   . Fortunately the enemy came to ourrescue by declaring, in February, 1915, that -&quot;All the waters surrounding Great Britain and Ireland,including the entire English Channel, an area of war,within which they would endeavour to destroy everymerchant ship that was found &apos;even if it be not alwayspossible to avert the peril which threatens persons and cargoes fo     Neutral shipping was warned to avoidentering the area since they might become the victims of attack directed against enemy ships&quot;04. The Order be came effective on 18th February, 1915,and on 3rd March the First Lord of the Admiralty of that day,who is again the First Lord of to-day, circulated to theCabinet a memorandum which, as shown by the following extract, applies almost as much to the position to-day as it did to that of March 19150&quot;The international laws relating to blockade were framedwithout reference to the new conditions introduced into warfare by the presence of the submarine0    Howevergreat the superiority of the stronger fleet, it is not practicable to draw blockading lines in close proximity to the enemy&apos;s coasts and harbours, as was always previously possible, because the submarines ofthe weaker fleet would sink the blockading vessels,although that fleet was unable or unwilling to put to sea.     It therefore becomes necessary to draw the-S-

5.lines of the &quot;blockade at a greater distance from theenemy&apos;s coasts and ports than heretofore, and this involves in certain cases the inclusion within thescope of the &quot;blockading lines not only of enemy hutof neutral ports0     This prevents the use of the term&apos;blockade? according to its strict technicalinterpretstiontJ     But it does not in the least prevent an effective blockade in the natural and practical,as opposed to the legal and technical, sense*     TheBritish naval blockade of German North Sea ports is atpresent maintained by the cruiser cordon at the mouth of the English Channel and the flotillas at the straits of Dover, and by the cruiser cordon and cruisersquadrons from the North of Scotland to Iceland.These blockading lines are in every sense effective;no instance is known to the British Admiralty of anyvessel, the stopping of which had been authorised bythe Foreign Office, passing them unchallengedo     Itis not a case of a paper blockade, but of a blockadeas real and as efficient as any that has ever beenestablished^ having regard to the new and unforeseenconditions of naval war*      The means of carrying on an effective blockade of the enemy5s ports ought not tobe denied to the stronger naval Power 0-, o.0a   - Allthe time we are ourselves subjected, so far as lies Inthe strength of the enemy,  to indiscriminate attacks by mines lying in the open sea, as well as to the deliberate sinking of merchantmen without challenge,by submarine agency0      It is for neutral nations torecognise that it is not practically possible, nor in neutral interests, to claim the maintenance of a situation which would deprive naval strength of all its rights while permitting naval weakness to indulge in every abuse&quot;0(&quot;The World Crisis/1 1919? pp0 294-5)0This had an immediate effecto   Eight days later theRetaliatory Order-in-Council of the 11th March, 1915, was -issued, which, among other things, enabled us to stop german exports.     This measure was much more rapidly effective than had ever been anticipated;,*During the last six months of 1915 the monthly figures of american imports from Germany and Austria were only4%-8% of those received in 1913 0   By the end of theyear they had almost disappeared&quot;,6*        To quote the Of ficial History   once more -xGermany was thus unable to pay in goods, even for thevery restricted supplies which she was now able toobtain from abroad&quot;ot* It is interesting to recall that in August, 1917, lord robert Cecil (now Viscount Cecil) secured the appointment ofan International Lav/ Committee -&quot;To consider what additions and amendments would bedesirable in the interests of Great Britain to the established rules of international law on the subjectof the conduct of hostilities, whether those rulesrest on treaty or custom&quot;0^Official History of Seaborne Trade, Payle, Vol^II,-3-

8. In its Report dated December 18th, 1915,the Committee passed the following Resolution -&quot;The Committee are of the opinion that,in view of the experience of the present war, it is desirable that the Declarationof Paris should, if possible, be abrogated,and they recommend that the Foreign office should be requested to consider-what steps should be taken for this purpose&quot;.9- The signatories of that important Committeeincluded Lord Cave, Viscount Caldecote (then T.W.H.Inskip, Esq..), Sir Eyre Crowe, Sir Cecil Hurst, ProfessorPearce Higgins, Sir Erie Richards, Rear-Admiral Hope,Rear Admiral Hall and other distinguished people.10.       Unfortunately, the Foreign Office never felt able to act on the recommendation of the Committee,and to-day we find ourselves in the same predicamentas we were in at the beginning of 1915*II.11.       The extract given in paragraph h above from Mr.Churchill&apos;s memorandum of March 3rd, 1915, is, as already mentioned, applicable to our present circumstances.We are exercising complete command of the sea but, owingto the existence of an obsolete international convention,we are unable to reap the full fruits.     It has been shown above that we never ought to have signed theconvention at all, that it was concluded under theinfluence of a war in which sea power played but littlepart;    that it was never ratified by the United Statesof America;    that in the next major war in which wewere engaged we seized the first opportunity to ridourselves of the handicaps it imposed, and that a verydistinguished expert committee recommended just beforethe Peace Conference that the Declaration should be denounced.      It is only extreme deference to neutral opinion that could keep us from&quot; denouncing it today.

But in 1939 neutral opinion is much less important than it was in 1915*      In that latter year theUnited. States of America were denouncing our high-handed methods in restraint of trade.      In 1939that country has deliberately prohibited its ships from trading in some of the waters most concernedin the stoppage of exports.      It is mainly throughItaly that the risk of evasion in American ships   isto bo apprehended.12.        It is certainly not less important to-day thanit was in 1915 to prevent the Germans from building up credits overseas.      Their credit position is much less favourable than it was in the early part of thelast war, and. they must find it very hard to pay even for essential imports, such as petroleum products orminerals, which they seek to smuggle past our contraband bases.13*       From a Parliamentary point of view our neglectto stop German imports would seem difficult to defend.Hi. The German violations of international lawwould appear quite sufficient to justify this step.They over-ran Poland in circumstances of great violence and horror without even the formality of a declarationof war.    On the 30th September, following the announce-ment of the arming of British merchant ships, aGerman wireless statement was made to the effect thatin future every British vessel would be regarded asa warship.      Since then they have sunk many merchant ships at sight, including passenger ships, with aresult that civilian passengers, among them women and children, have been drowned or have had to take to open boats.      They have sunk many neutral ships, and

on the 20th October the German Ambassador in Brusselswarned the Belgian Government that all neutral vessels which allowed themselves to be convoyed by british or French Forces would be torpedoed without warning.15.       It may be that it would be wise to wait ashort time in case Germany gives us a better pretextby some further act of aggression f   such as the invasion of Holland or Belgium, before we announce our intention to stop German exports, but I submit that if no such opportunity is offered within a week or twowe should delay no longer.(Intd.)    H.Treasury Chambers, S .W. 1,16th November, 1939.
