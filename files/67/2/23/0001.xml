C..L I?72.COPY NO..V3WAR CABINET.SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL EXPENDITURE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. There are now two notices of motion on the order paper:-Sir A.  Sinclair:-&quot;Defence Services.-  - That a Select Committee be setup similar to that appointed hy Parliament in July, 1917,to examine the current expenditure defrayed out of moneys provided by Parliament for the Defence Services, includingCivil Defence, and to report what, if any, economies,consistent with the execution of the policy decided by theGovernment, may be effected therein&quot;sir A. Pownall:--&quot;National Expenditure, - That a Select Committee ofthis House be set up, based on the experience of the SelectCommittee of July, 1917, to examine the current expendituredefrayed out of moneys provided hy Parliament on all servicesdirectly connected with war expenditure;    and to report whether any economies consistent with the policy decided byParliament can be effected&quot;.2. For some time past, pressure has been put on theGovernment to provide time for a debate in the House ofCommons on this subject.      This is very undesirable, for itwould be made the occasion of bringing forward allegedcases of waste without any opportunity of checkingstatements and would only provide fuel for a campaign inthe newspapers.      The Chief Whip has only been able toavoid such a debate by promising that a Question on thesubject of appointing a Select Committee will be answerednext week, and Tuesday is the day proposed.^* I have hitherto fought a delaying action over theproposal to appoint such a Committee, but I am convincedthat we shall have to consent to this plan (which repeats-1-

what was done in the last war) sooner or later, and I see no advantage in continuing an ineffective resistance with theresult that when we agree to the Committee, this will heproclaimed as a triumph for the Opposition and a surrenderToy the Government.      In previous Parliamentary answers anddebates, the utmost has been made of the steps already taken to limit expenditure, which are very substantial.In the first place there is the customary Treasury control which is more effective now than it was in the last war if only for the reason that there is now much closer contactand a greater degree of co-operation between the treasury and the Departments.      In addition special steps have beentaken, for example by the appointment of Sir Harold Howittand Mr. Ashley Cooper as Financial Members of the air council and Supply Council respectively;    the review ofA.R.P. Services which has been set on foot by the HomeSecretary;    the institution of &quot;flying squads&quot; consistingof a business man and a Treasury representative to examineparticular items of major expenditure, expecially in new and largely expanding Departments with a view to seeing ifthere are ways in which waste and extravagance can be avoided and the utmost economy secured to carry outcurrent policy.Some action on these lines has already been taken,and I propose,  in agreement with my colleagues, to institute similar &apos; flying squad&quot; investigations where they appear necessary.4&apos; But this does not alter the fact that when somelarge instance of wasteful expenditure, such as mustsometimes arise in war, attracts public notice, the casewill be made against the Governmei.it that we have continuedto obstruct the appointment of a Select Committee and that,

judging by the work of such a Committee in 1917s havesquandered public money hy resisting it.      I do not at allbelieve that the House of Commons Committee will be particularly effective for the purposes proposed, hut it isnot unnatural that the House of Commons should attach importance to it and in my judgment it cannot heeffectively resisted, expecially with the newspapers intheir present temper.The pressure for the appointment of some kind of economy committee, which will give private membersthemselves an outlet, is very insistent, and it comes fromall parties.      It is likely to continue and we must expect that there will be a public demand for econnmy.5. There is a further and very special reason whyI think there would be an advantage in appointing such aCommittee now.     We are constantly receiving letters atthe Treasury from correspondents who say that they willendure the stiff taxation proposed and will do their utmost to subscribe towards a loan - a matter of the greatest possible importance to us - provided that they aresatisfied that the money is not wasted.      Theannouncement of a Select Committee on national expenditure at this time might help the coming loan.6. Accordingly, in reply to the Question that willbe addressed to me to-morrows I propose to make a statement on the following linos:-

QUESTION.To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequerwhether he can now make any statement as to theappointment of a Select Committee on national expenditure..REPLY.The hon. Member will remember that in thecourse of my Budget speechsand on other occasions,I have emphasized the importance which theGovernment attached to economy in administration,and I have instanced a number of measures whichthe Government had taken with this object inview.    These measures included, for instance, theappointment of highly qualified and experiencedbusiness men to particular Departments for thepurpose of securing that all new proposals wereframed and all operations conducted on the most economical basis.      I mentioned also thatinvestigations on the spot were being undertaken in certain Departments by business men, and representatives of the Treasury and the department concerned, acting in association    This procedurewill be further developed, though naturally the timing of these investigations requires careful,consideration in the case of new or rapidly expanding Departments.       While, however I believethat our procedure is already becoming effective and will rapidly grow in effectiveness, I appreciate the desire of the House to satisfyitself upon this subject and to make its owncontribution to a common end0

The Government consider that this object would he best attained by making use of theEstimates Committee of the House of Commons and.enlarging its function^      In normal times theEstimates Committee is concerned, with examining the expenditure covered, by items in the Estimates;but in war-time a large part of our expenditure is met out of Votes of Credit which do not show,with anything approaching the precision of peace-time Estimates,  the objects of the expenditureoIf the Estimates Committee became a Select Committeeupon National Expenditure for the period of the war,though, of course it would have to be reappointedeach session, terms of reference might be devised which would broadly follovi/&apos; the lines set out inthe Motion which, stands in the name of the RightHono Baronet., the Member for Caithness and Suther-land and others,  and which correspond to the termsof reference under which the Select Committee was set up during the last war.      It may be feltdesirable that civil expenditure as well as war expenditure should be brought within its purview.The Government will,  therefore, be prepared. at anearly date to propose the appointment  of a SelectCommittee of the kind I have described!,, .The exact terms of reference should no cioubtbe considered in consultation with the various sections of the House, and if my proposal isgenerally approved.,  I shall be glad to put thismatter in handn(intld)    J. S.? Ambers, s.W. 1.November, 1939!&apos;
