COPY NO.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES OF FEEDING STUFFS ANDTHE WHEAT STOCKS POSITION.Memorandum by the Minister of Food.Terrace, S.W*loNovember, 1939,.

Memorandum by the Minlsxer of Food., 1 desire to support the proposals submittedby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of Stats for Scotland in their &quot;Memorandum(W.P. (Go)(39)81) of 10th November, 1939 dealing withthe supply of animal feeding stuffs.      I wish to add,however, certain comments and to refer to the presentserious position of the country&apos;s wheat stocks-,2, The Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotlandalludes to the fact that for various reasons reserves of feeding stuffs had only attained small dimensionson the outbreak of war, and that since the war started.their Departments have been in constant contact withthe Ministry of Food and have pressed the ministry to make every effort to increase supplies.      I would only comment on these statements that (i) the Ministryof Pood have male the most strenuous efforts withinover-ruling considerations of exchange and shipping to secure supplies;    and (ii) previous to the outbreakof hostilities it was not possible for the Food(defence Plans) Department to build up a substantialreserve of feeding-stuffs for live-stock, as the sumavailable under Cabinet decisions for capitalexPenditurs for food storage was sufficient only for a limited store of food for human eonsumptiono

3,        During the first three or four weeks of warpurchases of cereals overseas were restricted hy the limitations placed upon the buying of supplies indollar countries and by difficulties with the Argentineexchangee      The setting up of the convoy system hasseriously delayed the arrival of the shipments which havebeen made, and the failure to charter a sufficient number of neutral vessels has limited the amount oftonnage available.      On the 18th October, I submitted amemorandum (W.P. (G)(39)42) showing that if a full supply at cereals and cereal products from overseas was to beprovided and our stocks of cereals restored by the endof the year to the position which existed at theoutbreak of war,  some 850,000 tons of additional spacewould need to be chartered to arrive by the 31st December.The War Cabinet decided on 20th October that in view ofthe urgent necessity of importing by the end of Decemeerat least 850,000 tons of cereals (over and above cerealsfor which freightage has been arranged), it was essentialthat the present negotiations for the chartering of neutral tonnage should be strongly pressed.      Althoughthe Ministry of Shipping have directed many ships to load in Canada, the delays in convoy have been so great that the net gain has only been 40,000 tons, as comparedwith 850,000 tons referred to above.4.        AS a result of the combination of circumstances setout in the previous paragraph, the supply of imported feeding grains since the outbreak of war has not amountedto more than about one half of our normal requirements,and as stocks of maize.and barley at the outbreak of war were not more than a fortnight&apos;s supply, a serious shortageof feeding stuffs has arisen, which is already resulting in. the slaughter of pigs upon ? considerable scale.

fj4        More serious, however, than the shortage of feeding-stuffs is the fall in the stocks of wheat at the ports and inthe flour mills which has resulted from the small arrivalsof wheat since war broke out.     ^nless steps are taken atonce stocks will fall still further within the next few weeks.6. The appendix to this memorandum shows the stocks ofwheat as they were when war broke out, and as they are now.In estimating our ability to maintain the.bread supply, itis essential to look first at the stock of wheat in the publicgranaries and in the flour mills.      Including the GovernmentSecurity Stock, created before war broke out, the quantity in the public granaries and in the flour mills has fallen fromtwelve weeks&apos;  supply on the 3rd of September, to seven weeks&apos;supply at the present time, and is still falling (Table II)Even if all the vessels arrive which, allowing for the time taken in convoy, are expected to arrive by the 31st December,the stock of wheat may well fall by a further two or threeweeks&apos; supply before that date.      It is true that in the flourmills and the bakers&apos;  shops there is perhaps from two to three weeks&apos;  suppljr of flour and that at present we still have about eight weeks&apos; supply of wheat on the farms.      the flour stocks, however,  are merely working stocks and not inany sense a reserve.      The stocks on the farms can only bethreshed, at a rate which is limited by the machineryavailable and by the weather, and at this time of the yearthey are normally threshed, rather slowly because the farmeris occupied with other work.7. If millers are to produce flour it is essential thatthey shall have a proper mixture of wheats in their grist.If therefore stocks in the public granaries and in the flour

mills are allowed to go below a certain level serious difficulties arise, and flour mills may close.      warningsof closings at a near date are already being received froma.ome parts of the country.8.        The measures\\res which can be taken to prevent the stocksof wheat from falling further are as follows(a) As far as possible to load with wheat all ships chartered for grain.(b) To bring the horse-grown wheat supply underthe control of the Ministry of Food and require the authorised merchant who bmysit from the farmer to send a larger proportion to the flour mills.(c) To raise the extraction of flour to, say, 80per cent, from its present and normal levelof 70-73 per cent.The first of these measures has already been taken, and i recommend, that the second should be taken at once.     If thisis done it may not be necessary at present to lengthen the extraction of flour, a step which would immediately make the bread distinctly darker in colour.      It will be realised,however, that any of the above measures will increase theshortage of feeding stuffs, and so make rationing all themore necessary.9. If these two measures are taken, there is a reasonable chance that the stocks of wheat in the public granaries andin the flour mills will not be lower at the end of Decemberthan they are at present.     This, of course, is not asatisfactory position.     All the figures which have beenquoted above regarding the future stock position assume thatthere will be no serious interference with the arrival of convoys at the appointed time, or with the unloading of theships in the ports.     As we cannot be sure that such

interferences will not arise,  our stocks at present are too low for safety.      It is, therefore, essential that we should provide during the first three months of 192j.O for theincrease of these stocks.      This can only he done, however,either by providing a supply of tonnage in excess of our normal requirements or by loading ships with wheat to the exclusion of maize and other feeding grains.      As the survey of the position which is being unclertaken by the Ministryof Shipping may point to a reduction in tonnage for importingfood and feeding stuffs during the first year of the war byfrom twenty to twenty-five per cent, there does not seem tobe any hope of our obtaining tonnage in excess of normal requirements.      If that is so, it is clear that during thefirst three months of 19h-0 it will be essential for the safety of our bread supply that the amount of cereals forfeeding stuffs will- have to be substantially below thenormal quantities,10,        I therefore ask authority for the Ministry of Food,in consultation with the Agricultural Departments, to issue an Order which will bring under the Ministry&apos;s control thewhole supply of home grown wheat.      The Order would, requirefarmers to sell their wheat only to authorised merchants,and merchants to re-sell a definite proportion of the wheat to    flour   mills,     thus restricting their sales of home-grown wheat for feeding to livestock.(Intld. ) V/-.S.M.Ministry 0f Food11th November, 1939.
