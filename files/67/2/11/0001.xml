-C.L.-&apos; 715gpnnnMBNT IS THE PROPBRTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT(39) 6Q* OQEIJi9.1 sWAR      CABINET.CHARTERING OF NEUTRAL TONNAGE.Note by the Minister of Shipping.The position is as follows:-Sweden.A Shipping Agreement has been drawn up and discussed withthe Swedish Delegation and is in substance agreed, apart fromone point.    We have suggested that the rate of freight to bepaid for Swedish tonnage should be based upon British controlledrates, with necessary additions.    The Swedish Delegation on theother hand, now propose that Swedish controlled^ rates shouldbe adopted, but are not in a position to say what those rates are.    Yfe are prepared to accept them in order to get agreement,having an undertaking that the Swedish Government is fixingrates so as to provide only a reasonable profit.    The draft agreement provides for reinsurance by our war risk insuranceoffice of the war risks on the Swedish vessels carrying ourcargoes.The Shipping Agreement is to form part of the War trade agreement,  in conformity with the wishes of the Swedish   Governmentand the Swedish Shipping Delegate is understood to be returningat once to Sweden for final instructions.    The Shipping agreement will secure valuable use of Swedish tonnage for bringing goods to this country and France.Norway.The Norwegian Shipping Delegation arrived in this country at the beginning of the week and, after a preliminary meetingabout procedure in the morning, came to see me on Tuesdayafternoon.

They represented that in view of the numerous ownersv/hom it had heen necessary to consult and the fatigues of the journey, they were not ready for discussion next day and ameeting was fixed for Thursday morning, when negotiations wereformally opened.    Discussions are proceeding in a friendlyatmosphere, and we shall endeavour to &quot;bring matters to a headnext week, hut the Delegation, who are empowered to make an Agreement, if they are prepared to do so must in any casesecure ratification by the Grand Council of the Norwegian&apos;Shipowners&apos; Association, a process which will occupy about afurther week.    It has heen intimated that the norwegian government will not itself desire to approve or be a party tothe Agreement, hut the    shipowners will do nothing which is contrary to the general policy and views of their Government.The Delegation have agreed in principle that the tanker tonnage to be found by Norway should represent 1-g- million tonsdeadweight, including tonnage already on charter to the BritishEmpire and its allies.Greece.As soon as the political embargo placed by the GreekMinister in London upon any negotiations by Greek shipownerswas removed, the Ministry of Shipping got in touch with the leadingowners with a view to inducing them to charter boats to thiscountry.    Two such boats were chartered to the Ministry of Poodon Wednesday and, while the Greek owners are understood still tobe in communication with Athens, it is hoped that furtherarrangements will be made in the next few days for additionalships.    If the Greek vessels are taken on time charter and thecharterers have to pay hire, whether the ship was moving or not,Greek crews might be ever less inclined to sail than they arenow since owners would     have little motive to put pressureQn them.    In order to overcome this difficulty, we may have tomake arrangements on a voyage basis, under an agreement which

will require as many successive voyages to be made as can be accomplished within a specified period.Greek tonnage is showing a tendency to slip away to ParEastern waters and it will he necessary to apply hunkerand other pressure at an early date if they do not come forward with proposals for giving this country an adequate   v0lumeof tonnage at reasonable rates.Yugoslavia.An Agreement has heen concluded with a friendly Yugoslavianowner for 10 ships on a hare charter basis, representing some80,000 tons deadweight.      While the owner is thus not boundto find crews, he has undertaken to do what he can to assist in that direction, hut it may be necessary for us to man these ships.I propose to report the position in regard to neutral tonnage to the War Cabinet again at the end of next week, by which time further progress should have heen made,J.G.is try of Shipping,27th October, 1939.
