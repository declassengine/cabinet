SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (G.) (39) 77.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.WAR AIMS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a draft of a reply to the French memo-randum on war aims, which is reprinted for convenience in this paper.This reply has been prepared as a first draft, and, apart from any views mycolleagues may express, it will no doubt require modification in the light of the comments which will in due course be received from the Dominions. I wish,however, to let my colleagues see the draft in its preliminary stage.H.Foreign Office, November 8, 1939.BEFORE receiving the memorandum of the French Government HisMajesty^ Government had already given some preliminary consideration to thequestion of war aims. They had been prompted to consider this matter not onlyin order that some guidance might be given at a suitable opportunity to certain sections of British public opinion, but in order that the cause, in whose defenceHis Majesty^ Government stood united with the French Government, might gama wider and more intelligent support.2. The cause for which the Allied Governments of France and GreatBritain have taken up arms is to stop acts of aggression on the part of the GermanGovernment in the present and to ensure against their repetition m the future.Two wars imposed on Britain and France in a single generation by the action ofGerman Governments, differing in outward complexion but inspired by the sameaggressive and dominating spirit, are a solemn warning that this spirit, it it bejot extinguished and laid to rest by the Germans themselves, must be renderedharmless by those whom it threatens.10683   [20280]Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1939.
3. His Majesty&apos;s Government are therefore in agreement with the FrenchGovernment in desiring to find the surest and most enduring guarantees avainsrany further repetition of German aggression. They are convinced that sue!guarantees can only be based on close and continued co-operation between theFrench Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government during the period which will follow after the defeat of Germany. That co-operation, which during the warwill have covered economic as well as military and political problems, should beextended after the war has ended, and should, as His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould hope, be inspired by a common purpose and outlook on the machinery required to enable the nations of Europe to regain or maintain their liberties, andto strengthen their political, social, and economic structures.4. To achieve this common purpose His Majesty&apos;s Government and theFrench Government must, unless a German Government can be found which is willing and able voluntarily to accept their terms, secure the defeat of Germanyand this, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, constitutes the primarywar aim of the two Governments. It is only in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time when their object is achieved that the lines of any territorial settlement can be profitably considered. It would therefore be premature to enter into detailed discussion of territorial questions. For thisreason His Majesty&apos;s Government have been careful not to define in precise terms what they imply by the restoration of independence to Poland and Czecho-Slovakia, and to limit themselves to referring in general terms to the recoveryby the Polish, Czech and Slovak peoples of their liberties. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment trust that the French Government will adopt a similar attitude. It should,however, be pointed out that while it is hoped to secure independence for all european peoples, one of the weaknesses of the post-war settlement was theestablishment of a number of small national States which were &quot; viable &quot; neitherin the military nor economic sense. The settlement was therefore highly unstable,and proved an ineffective barrier to the expansionist ambitions of Great Powerseither in the West or in the East. Accordingly, it may be necessary to con-template some form of closer association, at the least a system of financial andeconomic-co-operation in Central and South-Eastern Europe.5. For this purpose His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that it would be wise to encourage at once closer co-operation between the Balkan States andcloser co-operation between the various refugee groups of Poles, Czechs, Slovaksand Austrians.6. As regards the future of the German Reich, His Majesty&apos;s government agree that the removal of Herr Hitler and his entourage may not be a sufficientremedy against the re-emergence of German militarist and expansionist ideas,but it is not at present possible to tell in what conditions the defeat or surrender of Germany will take place, and any suggestion that it was the intention ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government to seek the politicaldismemberment of Germany or to disrupt German unity would have the immediate effect of rallying the German people behind their present leaders. His Majesty sGovernment therefore consider it wiser to watch the course of events and toarrange for further consultation as soon as it is possible more closely to forecast the course of internal political developments in Germany.7. As regards material guarantees, the first must evidently be that Germanyshall never again be allowed to build up a preponderance of armed force inrelation to the United Kingdom and France. The methods of establishing this guarantee may perhaps be left for further consideration and in view of what has been said above it would seem premature to make any public statement of war aims in precise terms. His Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer that the twoGovernments in agreement should limit their public declarations to the general principles on which their common policy is, and will continue to be, based, anathat, while protecting the world, so far as is humanly possible, from a recurrence of war, they should emphasise their common desire to secure a post-war settlement&apos;which would be satisfactory not only to themselves but to all other peoples whosecollaboration will be essential in the work of reconstruction.8. These are the preliminary comments of His Majesty&apos;s Government onthe approach made by the French Government.   His Majesty&apos;s Government wi
swelcome a further exchange of views with the French Government, and will beo-lad to consider any proposals which the French Government have to make bothin regard to the terms on which peace should be concluded with Germany, and the wider European settlement which might follow the termination of hostilities.II.Viscount Halifax to Mr. R. I. Campbell (Paris).(No. 2613.)Sir, Foreign Office, October 23, 1939.&apos; THE French Ambassador called on me this afternoon and said that he hadinstructions to revert to the matter that he had raised a few days ago with sir A. Cadogan concerning the desirability of a joint attempt by the French andBritish Governments to define with greater precision their war aims. the ambassador left with me an aide-memoire which I append to this note. He saidthat the fundamental conviction of the French Government was that the objectof the war must be, so far as it could humanly be assured, to make impossible a repetition of the circumstances and the chain of events that had led to the presentconflict. This would certainly mean that our thoughts should range over a wide field, leading us to reconsider the plans that had found expression in the Treatyof Versailles and the reasons for that treaty&apos;s failure. M. Daladier&apos;s idea wasthat we should begin by having some exchange of general ideas on paper, after which it might be possible to give greater precision to those ideas by personaldiscussion. This would no doubt take time, but the French Government thoughtit desirable to begin trying to clarify our ideas. I told the Ambassador that i thought such an exchange of view would be valuable, and that I would informthe Cabinet of the communication that he had made.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.Enclosure.Memorandum.(Translation.)THE French Government have followed closely the reactions of various sections of British public opinion to the question of war aims. They realise thatthe necessity may arise for His Majesty&apos;s Cabinet to enlighten the British publicon this essential problem and to guide them in the search for solutions which willbe such as to protect Europe effectively against the return of events like thosewhich have brought about the present conflict. They therefore consider itparticularly desirable to proceed without delay to study this question m common,in a spirit of political foresight and wise realism.In the opinion of the Government of the Republic, the essential war aim ofthe allied nations should be, together with reparation for violated rights and foraggressions committed, to render it impossible for Germany to imperil again thepeace of Europe by the threat or the use of force. In this respect, it is evidentthat a change of Government at Berlin would not be a sufficient aim in itself.For it is not merely a question of obtaining from an eventual successor of herr Hitler, together with reparations for the past, a moral repudiation ofHitlerian methods; the security of France, and with it that of Great Britainand of all Europe, can no longer depend upon the goodwill of Germany. the setting-up of effective material guarantees, designed to prevent any offensivereturn of German imperialism and any violation by the Reich of the engagementswhich are imposed upon it, should be our principal aim in the war which we areconducting, and all secondary aims should be defined in relation to this essentialobjective.It has seemed useful, for tactical reasons, to designate Herr Hitler as thePrincipal obstacle to the re-establishment of peace, in order to hasten thedisaffection of the German people.  On the other hand, it is necessary to avoid a
tion of our objectives such as might result in reuniting all Germans behind their Fiihrer either by the threat to the unity or integrity of-the Reich which m%ht result from those objectives, or because they would call m question the^BSTK^dffia&quot; which enjoin upon us, for the moment, a certaincaution in the presentation of our war aims, should not prevent the Governmentsof France andfereat Britain from examining without delay, and m secret, everyaspect of the question, and, in the first place, the system of guarantees of securityXch it wfll ultimately be necessary to impose upon Germany. The FrenchGovernment are convinced that frank exchanges of views between London and paris should enable the necessary solution of this problem to be found by.mutual agreement.
