Telegram from VIViceroy elated 4th NovemberIMMEDIATE2550-S.private and personal.My private and personal telegram of this morning.I had two hours very friendlyconversation with Gandhi. His chief object was I think to try to secure some further liberalisation of my declaration but inthat he was unsuccessful.    Two main points which he raised were:2.      Dominion status.      I referred, him to Hoare&apos;s statement in columns 1634-1635 of Hansard of October 26th and. read out tohim extract from Balfour!s statement of 1926 in Bonn&apos;s speechreferred to by Hoare and reproduced in column 1625.    He explainedthat he and his friends had regarded HoareTs statement asreferring to the 1926 variety of Dominion status which was priorto appearance of Statute of Westminster.      I replied that as I understood it Dominion status was status which the Dominions had at any time, which,  if correct, meant that the term dominion status in 1939 covered the whole ground covered by Statute of westminster.      I promised however to clear the point in such way as might seem best.3.      I can see very little real justification for any Congressdoubts but as they apparently attach importance to the pointsuggest that it might be possible to make it clear beyond anyQuestion by an arranged question and answer on Monday.&apos;.

4.    Your reference to Congress representing Hindus and moslem League as representing Moslems.      Gandhi said, that he felt very deeply on this question, which he must take up andclear unless that was done spontaneously.      The spot was a verytender one,  and he was already receiving telegrams urging thatin the face of such &quot;insult&quot; negotiations could not proceed.I told him I thought he &quot;was taking much too seriously a casualreference of a quite general character in an extempore speech and that I know you much too well and. you knew India much toowell to make it likely you would say anything that could possibly be eons trued as unfair.      I would however inform youof his feeling,  and. I would beg him to take no action of any sort until I had been able to hear further.5.      Here again we have of course a point on which Congresswith their extreme anxiety to be regarded as non-sectarian andas all-embracing are morbidly touchy.      We do not at the sametime want if we can avoid it to involve ourselves in controversyas to how much they do or do not represent.      If however you have any opportunity of clearing the air publicly in immediatefuture it would I think be worth doing,  and I suggest that some sort of message from you to Gandhi through me of a reassuringcharacter might also be- appropriate.      I should have thought itwould probably suffice to say that he had placed far too narrowa construction (? on your) remark,  and that it had never been

your intention to suggest that you regarded Congress as re-presenting exclusively Hindus and that you were well aware thatit was in no sense exclusively or entirely Hindu in characteror composition.6.      I will telegraph separately at greater leisure asregards general outcome of our conversation.    There was no suggestion of any withdrawal- on Gandhi&apos; s part of Congressdemand for a declaration, hut we discussed with the utmostfriendliness situation under Section 93 and d&quot;&apos;  course of future(? constitutional) development.    He pressed that during Section93 Governors should steer a moderate course as regards Congressactivities and freedom of speech for Congress.    I told him thatthis must he a matter for the discretion of the Governors hutthat I had every confidence in their tact and judgment.    Butif there were serious transgressions there could he no questionof suspending or withholding action.      He said that he quiteunderstood.      He commended our decision to avoid minorityministries and fact that we appeared to be using Europeanadvisers almost,  if not quite,  exclusively,  and said he feltcertain that this was likely best to pave the way for anemergence from Section 93.      The use of Section 93 had not heenm the least misunderstood.    It Was indeed a statutory provision and was not a sanction and he felt confident that Governorswould bear that in mind.7.      I threw (corrupt group)  (&apos;? fly) over (&apos;? development of)Federation and discussed   variety of hypothec.e-y &apos;3** in that

ccnnection. which I will repeat separatelyo      While repeatingthat he could commit no one he responded exceptionallywell to the possibility of reversion later to Federationhut doubted if the time was yet ripe,  though he left theimpression of being much attracted b y the idea.8.    I got the impression that Gandhi is prepared toaontemplate a longish period of Section 93, but very anxious to avoid civil disobedience (he seemed hopeful ofthis).      He was emphatic in his assertion of his desire towork for peace at the earliest possible moment, but did notbudge as regards his declaration.9.    I am seeing Jinnah this afternoon,  and willtelegraph result.

Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroydated 4th November,,  1939.flf/.     Private and personal       Your private and personal telegram I\To. 2543-S of to--day.     My speech in Houseof Lords on October 2nd.    I had been referring tocommunal differences and to importance of an endeavourbeing made to bring about a reconciliation between viewpoint of Muslims and Hindus, and. I sec from Hansard that what I said was, Begins,  &quot;I do not want to underline the differences but they cannot be ignored.     You have gotto try somehow or other to reconcile them.      ghat in thesecircumstances is the path of wisdom?      Surely the pathof wisdom is to invite the leaders in the first instanceof the two main communities,  the Hindus as represented by the Congress and the Muslims as represented by theAll-India Muslim League to meet under the auspices of a neutral to discuss their differences frankly and to see whether they cannot find some solution of them&quot;.      End.sI do not think that what I said was misleading to anyonehere;    but I am of course aware that the All India muslim league does not represent all the Muslims of India any-more than does the Congress represent all the Hindus andI am equally aware that there are Muslims who are membersof the Congress.      If what I said is felt to be misleadingin India you are at liberty to publish an explanationon the above lines.

With reference to joint interview which mr.Gandhi, Dr.Rajendra Prasad,  President of Congress, andjayself had with you on 1st November and in reply to youri(letter, dated November 2nd,  I beg to inform you that I!understood that Congress leaders and myself were to&apos; consider the proposals of Your Excellency namely -ti quote from Your Excellency&apos;s letter1 - &quot;The propositionwhich I invited you and other gentlemen present to consider,as leaders of Congress and Moslem League-, was that, giventhe great importance of ensuring harmonious working at theCentre, you should enter u &amp;n discussions between yourselvesin the provincial field consequent on which you could let mehave proposals which would result in representatives of yourtwo organisations immediately participating in CentralGovernment as members of my Executive Council.      I brought out too,  that in my judgment it ought not to be necessaryabsolutely to resolve every detail of such differences asmay exist in Provinces.      What was required, as was remarkedin coarse  of discussion, was a degree of agreement inrespect of Provinces such as to make it possible for my visitors- and organisers which they represented, to putforward a scheme which could be considered for theCentreu,Awlthbi;utprejudice to resolution of Moslem League of22nd October stating that declaration of ,/our Excellencyon/
