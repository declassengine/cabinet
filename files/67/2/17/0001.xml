This document is the property of His Britannic1.1 a j esty&apos; s Government.Secret,f.P. (G)(39)6G.BUEKA.CopyThe Ministers&apos; request for assurances in regard to burma&apos;s constitutional advance.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Burma.My third and fourth periodical Reports on Burma datedthe 17th October and the 1st November give a brief accountof the discussions which the Governor has had with his ministers on the question whether a statement carrying theauthority of His Majesty&apos;s Government should not be made to burma conveying assurances in regard to the future constitutional development of that country.    My reports haveshown that, up to the 31st October, Sir A.Cochrane had successfully evaded the need for replying to the minutepresented to him by his Ministers on 12th October in whichthey ash that Burma should not be overlooked in any declaration that might be made with reference to further developments in regard to India;    on the 31st October, however,the Premier repeated his request for permission to publishthis minute in order to bo able to counter the propaganda of the  Freed can bloc led by the  ex-Premier, Dr. 3a Maw, proving that the present Ministry had not omitted to take theopportunity to secure from H.M.G.  further assurances as to burma&apos;a constitutional advance.On the 1st November the Governor telegraphed again tothe effect that the Premier was pressing for permission to publish the minute of 12th October and wished the Governor

also to make it publicly known that he holds regular weeklymeetings with his whole Council of Ministers and thus keepsthem fully informed 0:1 all. matters of importance connectedWith the war and the Defence of Surma-    (These meetings are,of course, quite distinct from the meetings of the defence council in which three Ministers are included, for the function of the Council is to take executive action in regardto matters connected with the War which impinge on functionsof government discharged by the departments in the control ofMinisters.)I attach to this Memorandum (a.3 appendices II, III, andI respectively in their chronological orderYthe Governor1stwo last telegrams of 31st October and 1st November and alsothe telegram of 12th October which gives the text of theCouncil&apos; s minute for permission to publish which they are nowpressing.It will be seen from Sir A.Cochrane&apos;s telegram of 1stNovember that ho feels that the Ministers&apos;  position vis-a-vis the Freedom bloc would be worsened, not improved, by thepublication merely of a, minute asking for some statement fromM.M.G.  and that publication of this alone must intensify thedemand for an answer in the name of His Majesty&apos;s Government.I entirely agree with Sir A-Cochrane in this and think thatit would be a far better move for securing the continued co-operation of the present Ministry if, when the Ministers&apos;ninute is  published,  a statement by the Governor in reply onthe authority of His Llaj esty&apos; s Government could be published at the same time.In his telegram of 31st October the Governor hasfurnished a rough draft of a statement to be made by himself0;&apos;i the overt authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government.        The&quot;A

liOmain thesis of the Governor&apos; a draft is  that theconstitutional problem of India is very different from thatof Burma since separation;    but the last sentence of hisdraft seems to mo rather to cloud this point, for the assurance given by the last few words in regard to the pace of Burma&apos;s progress is correlated with that of India&apos;sprogress.      Such correlation of the two cases not onlyobscures the main point which the statement seeks to makebut might, in certain circumstances, be definitelyembarrassing;    for it is not impossible that some further statement may have to be given to the people of India whichmay have to make further reference to the attainment by india of Dominion Status,  in terms which would notnecessarily be appropriate for application to the case of burma, but might nevertheless be held automatically to applyto Burma by virtue of the last words of Sir A.. Cochra.no&apos; sstatement if they wore allowed to stand.Tho last six words of his preceding sentence seem tomo also open to criticism,  for they imply that Burma Vsconstitutional advance depends on the treatment accorded byHis Majesty! s Government, that is to say on action byHis Majesty&apos;s Government, whereas the policy which Sir A.Cochrane has with my entire approval boon pursuing for thelast 2jV years, and which he has recently expounded to his ministers and which has boon accepted by them, is that further advance depends on their own action and not on thatof His Majesty&apos;a Government.I have attempted to give effect to these criticisms ofSir A.Cochrane&apos;s draft in tho revised draft which isattached to this Memorandum.      I am assuming that thoGovernor is right in his belief that a quite short statement

4.will serve the purpose in the conditions of Burma.It will he remembered that the Ministers&apos; minute towhich it is proposed, that Sir A.Cochrane should now reply was proposed and presented to him before the Viceroy had made his recent statement to the people of India.      Theterms of that minute are therefore not appropriate to thepresent position and to the revised draft appended I have therefore prefixed an introductory sentence of the sensewhich seems to me to be called for by the change in thesituation due to the lapse of time since the minute was first presented to the Governor.In his telegram of 1st November Sir A.Cochraneindicates that he proposes to make public his recentlyestablished practice of regular meetings with his ministers to discuss matters connected with the war.      It is not quite clear whether he intends to do this by mention of thematter in the course of statements he now proposes to makein the name of His Majesty&apos;s Government or by some other means and he has been asked to explain his iiitention more precisely:    this however is a matter of detail.Z.2nd November, 1939,

Telegram from the Govern or of Burma.____Satal-lSth^Ootohoi; ,..1929,__________597-C.     Premier has sent me a communication relatingto constitutional development in India and Burma in following terms:Begins:-The Governor-General of India has heen havingextensive talks with Indian leaders both in Simla and in new Delhi.      It is universally believed in India that these consultations are being held for the purpose of arriving atsome agreement as regards future political status of india as an equal partner of the British Commonwealth.2.      The Congress Party in India has asked His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to clarify war and peace aims of the BritishGovernment with particular reference to India.      In astatement dated Wardha, 28th Septembers Mr. Gandhi saidwIf British are fighting for freedom, all that theirrepresentatives have, to state in clearest possible terms isthat freedom of India is necessarily included in war aims&quot;.3.      It is qiiite certain that His Majesty&apos;s Government will-in the near future make a statement stating the aims ofEngland and Prance in entering upon this war and it isprobable that occasion will he taken then or at a later date to make a declaration regarding India.     We in Burma havenot chosen to adopt the tactics of Congress hut it willnevertheless he incumbent upon ourselves to protect and promote the political interests of this country.     whatever may be the measure of reforms to he meted out&apos; to India we areof opinion that circumstances in this country are such thatBurma not only deserves but is also capable of assimilatinga larger measure of reforms than India.      In the circumstances we/

3.-.7G would request His Excellency kindly to address HisMajesty&apos;s Government so that Burma is not overlooked in any declaration that might he made v/ith reference to further(?:omission) regarding India.     We would even go further and ask His Excellency to urge Eis Majesty&apos;s Government to declare that further reforms in Burma will he at least notless than those to be conferred on India.    Bnds&apos;.&apos; .2,      The statement, in the third paragraph, that my ministers have not chosen to adopt tactics of Congress is correct.      The whole document appears to me to be couched inreasonable terms and I hope that it will be possible for you to give a favourable reply to request contained in the lasttwo sentences of paragraph 3.3o      I am arranging to see Premier tomorrow morning andshall request him to maintain secrecy regarding minutereported in this telegram and also on matters referred toin my telegram 396-C of today&apos;s date.      I anticipate,however,  that Premier will wish to publish minute quoted inthis telegram together with reply which you may authoriseme to make and I hope you will he able to agree to this being done at first convenient opportunity .

APPENDIX II.Telegram from the GovernorDated 31st October, 1919 39.of Burma.444-C.Personal.My weekly talk with Miinisterstook place this morning.      Premier asked if he might publishstatement reported in my telegram No.397-C of 12th october .My reply, that I should have to consult you, was readilyaccepted and Premier will see me again tomorrow, hut withoutexpecting a definite reply.     A long discussion ensued onthe question of constitutional development and followedgenerally the lines of similar discussion last week reportedin my telegram No.433-C,  dated October 24th, and my personal letter of october  25th.2.      Although Premier did not ask for a reply from HisMajesty&apos;s Government to his statement, hut only requestedpermission to publish latter, I anticipate that he will askfor something more positive tomorrow.      There is reason tobelieve that Ministers do not now desire a statement thatwould merely repeat the assurances already on record, forthey recognise that problems to he settled in Burma beforefull development of Constitution can he attained are notnecessarily the same as those arising in India;    the recognition of this fact tends to strengthen their desire that it should he made clear that Burma will not lag behindIndia in constitutional advance.3*     A long statement does not seem to he called for and i suggest something on the following lines:      &quot;I have authorityof His Majesty&apos;s Government for stating that they reaffirmthe statement made on 20th January, 1931, by the Secretary ofState for India, when he announced, in the following terms,the decision of His Majesty1s Government to proceed with the separation/

separation of Burma.     Begins;    That prospects of constitutional advance hold out to Burma as part of british india will not he prejudiced toy this decision and thatconsitutional objective after separation will remain the progressive realisation of responsible governments in Burmaas an integral part of the Empire.    Ends.      In the view ofHis Majesty1s Government, experience gained during two and half years that Burma has been separated from India has shownthat the problems to be solved in the two countries are notidentical and may call for different treatment.      HisMajesty&apos;s Government therefore affirm that necessity forregarding the problems of the two countries as distinct andof considering them separately, will not be allowed to prejudice or retard the advance of Burma relative to that ofIndia&quot;.4.     After this morning&apos;s discussion I can affirm that ministers(? intend) to act consitutionaily but if it is notpublicly known that they have made representations they willbe placed at a disadvantage when dealing with de.:;ands of freedom Bloc and I am definitely of opinion that if we cannot do something to strengthen their hands I may not continue toreceive ready co-operation which they are giving at presentand that they might be driven to resign by force of publicopinion.5.      If my coming interview with Premier shows that he wouldbe satisfied with publication of his statement and wouldnot press for a reply I hope you will be able to agree that publication would do no harm.      If, however, Premier asks for more 1 feel that line of draft in paragraph Ho.5 would be suitable.     At a time when Congress Ministries are resigningit seems desirable to acknowledge the difference of theproblems/

3.problems relating to constitutional advance in India and burma;    the public recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentof this difference would satisfy reasonable public opinion in Burma and would avoid repeating in fresh terms theintentjens of His Majesty&apos;s Government which are already on record.6,      I shall telegraph again after seeing Premier.

APPENDIX III.Telegram from the Governor of Burma.Dated 1st November, 1939.446 C*    Personal.      My telegram No.444 C of October31st.      premier informed me this morning that he wished tohave permission to publish statement contained in my telegramNo.397 C and also    requested me to make known that I was holding regular meetings with Ministers and thus keepingthem fully informed of all matters of importance connectedv/ith war and defence of Burma.      The latter point does not present any difficulty (my confidential report number 21 ofOctober 9th 1939).2.     When I asked Premier if he thought action he proposed would be sufficient to prevent serious attach on government by Freedom Bloc he replied that he thought it would go along way to &quot;neutralise&quot; the efforts of Freedom Bloc.After careful consideration of this proposal which was firstput forward yesterday I feel that premier&apos;s judgment is atfault as I cannot believe that publication of a request fora statement from His Majesty&apos;s Government, without any indication whether a reply was to be given and if so thenature of reply, could have any other effect than an-intensification of demand for a statement.      I consider bothyou and I would be placed in an awkward position if definiterequest contained in last sentence of Premier&apos;s minutereceives publicity but remains un-answered.3.      I therefore request that for reasons given inparagraph 4 of yesterday&apos;s telegram yon will consider the suitability of draft contained in my telegram No.444.      if/

2.I am authorised to give a reply on these lines I &quot;believethat this action would he effective in stabilising positionof Government.4.      Premier is aware that I am consulting you and will see me again as soon as I am in a position to reply tohis request,

APPENDIX IV.Draft reply from j^e^^e^-e^a^f^yfy-Qia^-St,-^ governor of Burma.Tiie communication which you presented to me on the12th October and to which I am now replying was drawn up in anticipation of the statement by the Governor-General of india which was made on the 17th October, and it therefore containscertain phrases which are no longer appropriate to the situationand certain questions and requests which no longer call for a specific answer.I am, however, now authorised to make this reply :I have the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government for statingthat they reaffirm the statement made on the 20th January,1931,by the Secretary of State for India when he announced in thefollowing terms the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government toproceed with the separation of Burma:     &quot;That the prospects of constitutional advance held out to Burma as part of british india will not be prejudiced by this decision, and that theconstitutional objective after separation will remain the progressive realisation of responsible governments in Burmaas an integral part  of the Empire.&quot;In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government the experience gained during the two and half years that Burma has beenseparated from India has shown that the problems to be solvedin the two countries are not  identical, and that the methodsof their solution will therefore differ.    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, nevertheless, affirm that they do not regard thisdifference as forming an obstacle to the attainment by Burmaof her due place in the British Commonwealth of Nations, andthat they will continue to use their best  endeavours to promote the attainment of this objective,  so far as it lies with themto do so.
