COPY of telegram from the Prime Ministerof the Commonwealth of Australia, dated 14.11.39.No. 1&amp;5.      MOST SECRET.With reference to your telegram circular D.68.Australian Government does not desire to makemerely verbal criticisms.     We feel that there are twounderlying matters of great importance:      the first isthat we should do nothing to impair our complete unitywith France and that consequently in any statement thegreatest emphasis must be placed upon the view that our first wsr aim is to win completely and not to become involved in a patched up compromise.      Pro!:; this pointof view we dislike reference in paragraph 4 topossibility of finding a German Government which is willing and able voluntarily to accept our terms.      Ifthis contemplates a revolutionary movement in Germanywe think it over-optimistic      If it contemplates some form of puppet Government we think it dangerous.Our second war aim is to establish after victorya more secure Europe and therefore a more secure world,and this will involve territorial, economic and politicalsettlements of a kind designed to encourage disarmament,a stimulation of international trade - if possible bythe revival of international investment, and territorial

settlements which are cased not upon the status quobut upon the giving of real independence to peoplesv/ho are by race and tradition outside the Germanstate1.We are profoundly apprehensive of any suggestion that the peace of Europe or of the worldis to &quot;be secured by political dismemberment of germany or any artificial attempt to disrupt German unity,for we feel that such a suggestion would not only have the present effect of rallying German people&quot;behind Hitler but would have ultimate effect of laying the foundations for a future nationalistic movement ofan aggressive hind which would inevitably produceanother war.In brief we think that there is everything tooe gained by stating in conjunction with France, ourirrevocable determination tc pursue this war to victory,while at the same time announcing for the benefit of thewhole world that when the war has been won we are notlooking for a peace which has to ho indefinitelyMaintained by force, but that we are  genuinely anxious toestablish international conditions which will be conduciveo freedom and prosperity, not only for ourselves and thesmaller European states whose existence has been destroyed0- t&amp;reatoned, but for Germany herself.      Ends.      MEP/ZIE3.
