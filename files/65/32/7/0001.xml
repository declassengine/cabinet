MINUTE 3.11Gonfideiitlal Annex?(15th December? 1942 - 5050 p*mo )RUSSIA,SuppliesandMilitaryAssistanceo(previous reference:W.M.(42) 136thConclusions,Minute lo)THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he would haveto seek guidance from the War Cabinet or the DefenceCommittees on future convoy arrangements to north russia,,   The matter had been discussed at. the allied supplies Executive on the previous afternoons   he explained that arrangements had now been made for aDecember convoy (re-numbered J0Wo5$) to sail in twopartso   This would clear off all but two of theAmerican and British ships which had been awaitingconvoy in Iceland for several monthseIt was proposed that the January convoy(re-numbered JoWtv52q) should also sail in two parts*Arrangements had been completed for the first- part,which would comprise 16. ship So   The position in regardto the second part of the January convoy was that,while there were substantial quantities of low prioritygoods (foodstuffs,, machine tools etc) available for loading? neither the War Office nor the Air Ministrysaw their way to make any substantial quantities of tanks and aircraft available without interfering with-allocations earmarked for oversea theatres of operations.A similar position would arise with future, convoys,assuming the continuance of a monthly cycle ofsailings?For example, the War Cabinet were informedthat, over and above 250 Hurricanes included in thefirst part of the January convoy, all availableHurricanes were now required in the Middle East*As regards tanks, a rather difficult position &apos;had arisen-, inasmuch as the- Russians had now raisedobjection to receiving 2-pdr9 Churchill tanks? and wished to receive only tanks mounting the 6-pdr gun,,..It had been possible to meet their requests so far as concerned tho 20 3 -pdro Ohurchills in the first partof the January convoy, but we could not meet theii?wishes thereafter without taking away 6-pdra tanks fromtroops in &apos;this countryoReference was made to the request made to thePrime Minister by Premier Stalin during August last tothe effect that the Soviet Government were more anxiousto get lorries than to get tankso

The War Cabinet wds informed that there was an acute shortage of lorries in this country.     4.000 hadbeen offered from Canadian production, but we could not get them to this country unless we sent ships to fetchthem.    It seemed that the best plan might be to send them in Soviet ships via Vladivostok./ &apos; THE MINISTER OP WAR TRANSPORT said that the r* United States had recently transferred a number of-ships to the Sovie t flag, and these ships were now employed   J%;.   !between the West Coast of America and Vladivostok.     this action had naturally reduced the number of ships which,the United States were able to make available for NorthRussian convoys-.     The Russians were also using a number offit their ships on this Pacific routg.   It looked as thoughiBfuture the&quot;size of the convoys might have to be reduced from 30 to 20 ships.   Even so. it would be very difficultto make suitable British ships available for regularmonthly convoys to North Russia.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we were under an obligation to send material to the Russians, and hewould like to inform M. Stalin that we were making arrangements to send convoys in January (in two parts),in February, and in March.   Every endeavour must be madeto fulfil our obligations and to send high prioritysupplies to the Russians.   We were not, however, under any obligation to supply Russia with 6-pdr. tanks up tothe full number of tanks provided in the Protocol.   Ifthe United States were sending goods across the NorthPacific, we must reconcile ourselves to smaller convoysgoing to North Russia.   He asked the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to consider the matter with theAllied Supplies Executive and to submit a Report, forconsideration by &quot;the War Cabinet, setting out what wecould,send to Russia during January, February and March,, in fulfilment of our obligations, and the implications of the course proposed^The Prime Minister said that it was significant that the Japanese were not interfering with the transitto Russia of goods on the route West Coast of theUnited States to Vladivostok in ships which had only recently been transferred from the American to the Russianflags   Ho would be glad if the Foreign Secretary would consider what light this threw on japan&apos;s attitude.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.16th December, 1942*
