(Previous Reference: W.M. (42) 172nd Conclusions Minute 7.)

Reference was made to the preliminary discussion which had taken place on this matter at the last meeting of the War Cabinet, when it had been explained that the question whether the second half of the January convoy could be sailed, and the date of its departure, depended on the availability of adequate escorts.

THE FIRST SEA LORD said that he would like to wait and see whether the second half of the December convoy reached North Russia safely before deciding about the second half of the January convoy. He thought that it was important to as certain whether the enemy intended to use surface ships against these convoys, in which event, of course, a stronger escort would be required.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought it was urgently necessary that a decision as to the January convoy should be reached in the near future.

THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the Admiralty thought it was inadvisable to sail full convoys (i.e., 30 ships or more) during the dark months owing to the difficulty of keeping so large a convoy together.  It was arguable whether it would be safe to resume full convoys as early as the second half of January. He had, however  arranged that the loading of the ships, which had previously been fixed to be completed by the 20th, should be expedited so that they should be ready to leave loading ports on the 17th January. It would thus be open to us, if we thought fit, either to call a full convoy or to send two half convoys separately in the latter half of January.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that, while he welcomed the measures taken by the Admiralty, he thought that we ought to inform M. Stalin in the course of the few days that a definite decision had been reached to ? either a full convoy or two half convoys in January. So far, M. Stalin had only been informed as to the December convoys.

The War Cabinet -

Took note of those statements, and invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to make a further report on this matter to the Prime Minister in the course of the next few days.
