(7th October, 1942 - 12.30 p0ra.)The following were the. main points made in thediscussion, of the draft telegram to President Roosevelt.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that he had considered thesuggestion that the merchant vessels sailing singly bythe Northern route to Russia.should be escorted bysubmarines,,     The^se merchant vessc-3s would travel at a speed of 9 knots if they were British, or 10 knots ifthey were American..     The only submarines which couldkeep pace were the large &apos;P&apos;  class, all of which were atpresent earmarked for TORCHo     The only possible plan would be to sail the ships in pairs, with one submarineto&quot;each pair.     For this purpose three submarines wouldbe&apos; required in all&apos;.     On investigation, however, even this plan had little to recommend it.     As soon as apair of ships had been located by the enemy&apos;s air reconnaissance/ the submarine&apos; would have to dive.     Itsspeed submerged would only be three knots, so that itwould rapidly fail behind.     It would thus not be avail-able to rescue the crews if the ships were bombed.Moreover, a *Pf class submarine could only take onboard 25 to 30 men over and above the crew, whereas theminimum crew of each merchant ship would be 50.     \7henon the surface, the submarine would be exposed to thedanger of being torpedoed by a U-boat.     To make three submarines available would mean weakening the forces on which we shouldNhave to rely to prevent the enemyreinforqing North Africa across the Mediterranean.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that it might bepossible to patrol with submarines the route which the -merchant ships might follow.,     Perhaps the Russiansmight help in this way.THE FIRST 3:.iA LORD said that he would consider this proppsal, though he did not think it would be wise to hold out the presence of submarines as an inducement to the crews who would volunteer to man the merchantshipSfr     The chances of a submarine making touch withthe boats of a sunk vessel would be very remote.     Hewould also take up with the Russians the possibilityof help by their naval forces in Northern waters.THE. MINISTER OP LABOUR thought that a greateffort should be made to install a Bomber force inNorthern Russia during the winter,&apos;, so that, the Germanairfields in Northern Norway could be heavily attacked in the1Spring and Summer,when our convoys were passings

W^,   Draft Telegram to Premier Stalin, Incorporating&apos;&apos;&apos; the Prosidonfs amcndmcntSp1.    . V/e shall attack in Egypt-, towards the end ofthis month -and TORCH will begin ear^y in November. &apos;The effect of these operations must be either -(a) To oblige-the Germans to send air and land forces to counter our move:     or(b) to compel them to accept the new position -created by our success, which would thencreate a diversion by the threat of attack1   against Sicily and the south of Europe.2.     Our attack in .-gypt will be in good force.T.OR-JH will be a heavy operation in which, in additionto the U.S, Navy, 240 British warships and more than half a million men will be engaged.     This is-allrolling forward irrevocably.G*     The President and I are anxious to put an anglo-American Air Force on your Southern fl&amp;nkand operate it under the strategic control 0f the&quot; Soviet High Command,     This Force would consist/of the following:   British: 9 Fighter SquacLro.nsr FiveBomber Squadrons.     United States:    1 Heavy.BombardmentGroup, 1 Transport-Group.     Orders have been; issuedby us to assemble this Force and take Mb&amp;lfiQ stationso that they would be available for combat early inthe New Year,     Most of this Force will come from egypt as soon as they can be disengaged from the battle there, whioh &quot;we believe willv$fiL successfulon our part. s

4. In the letter which M. Maisky delivered to me on the 5th october, you asked for a great increase in fignter aircraft supplied to Russia by this country and the United States. We will send you as soon as possible by the Persian Gulf route, 150 Spitfires, with the equivalent of 50 more in the form of s.ares to be sent as they become available, as a special reinforcement which we cannot repeats. This special reinforcement is over and above the protocol supplies by the Northern Route so far as it can be used.  President Roosevelt will cable separately about the United States contribution.

5.I was greatly relieved that so large a proportion of the last convoy reached Archangel safely. This success was achieved only because no less than 77 warships were employed on the operation.Naval protection will be impossible until our impending operations are completed. As the necessary escorts are withdrawn from TORCH they can again be made available in northern waters. 

6. Nevertheless, we intend in the meanwhile to do our best to send you supplies by the Northern route by means of ships sailed independently instead of escorted convoys. Arrangements have been made to sail ships from Iceland during the moonless period 28th October-8th November. The ships will sail singly, at about 200-mile intervals,with occasional larger gaps, and rely on evasion and dispersions

7. ? hope to resume the flow of supplies in strongly escorted convoys from January 1943.

Nevertheless, we intend in the meanwhile to do-pur best to send you supplies by the Northern^poute bymeans of ships sailed independently instead of inescorted convoys.   Arrangements have been made to sailabout ten ships from Iceland during the moonless period28th 0ctobor-8th November.

If your Staffs could make a goodplan the President and I would at once examine thepossibility of co-operating up to the limit of our ability.   Ends.W.S.C.7.10.-2-
