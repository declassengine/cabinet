( 42 V 17P.ND CONCLUSIONS . MINUTE .4.Confidential Annex.(23rd December, 1942 - 5.30 p.m.)NORTH AFRICA.THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE WAR OFFICE saidthat he had spent two days at Allied Headquarters atAlgiers on his way back from the Middle East.     He hadnot had time to visit the Front,- but had formed certainimpressions as the result of conversations which he had had with General Eisenhower and a number of senior officers.The strongest impression he had received wasthat the greater part of the attention of both Britishand ,imerican senior officers was taken up with mattersof French politics.     In two long interviews, general eisenhower had talked of little else.     During these conversations there had been frequent interruptions bysenior officers who came in to take General Eisenhower&apos;instructions on some question bearing on French politics,such as the relationship between General Nogues and admiral Darlan, and whether Admiral Darlan could be persuaded to remove from office the Mayor of Constantine.General Eisenhower had said that he found thetask of dealing with these matters increasingly burden-some, and hoped that some way of relieving him of thesematters would soon be found.     In the meantime he feltthat&quot;he must continue to handle them Himself, since he regarded the political situation in North Africa as a factor of major military importance.   / The Generalthought that our ability to capture Tunis quickly was entirely dependent on French co-operation.There was no doubt that a number of thePrefects and Mayors were sympathetic to the Axis.     This,presented a serious danger.     Fears were expressed ofwhat would happen if there was sabotage on the railway.This ran through mountainous country, and any damagemight take months to repair.     Concern was also feltabout the presence of spies in the country, and GeneralAnderson, whom he had seen at Algiers, had said that hethought it was-no coincidence that a number of ourheadquarters had been located by the enemy and bombed.It was thought that Admiral Darlan was doing what hecould to get rid of unsatisfactory officials, but he   -was not strong enough to make a wholesale clearance.General Eisenhower thought that the whole position wouldhave to be reconsidered after the1 outcome of the battlewhich would soon be launched for the capture of Tunis.1:8 we failed to take Tunis, then a difficult situation would arise, since a number of the Vichy sympathiserswould no doubt wish to take steps to insure themselves

against, tho possibility of an Axis army ve^ohqfoQv rg**l^orth Africa.   In. these oircxiiastahces a situation might easily arise which would get beyond Admiral Barlah8 control.   If this happened, General Eisenhower thought that admiral Darlan would-have to be persuaded to Retire infavour of some other candidate, almost certainly GeneralGiraudo   But in the circnmstances envisaged^ it would be essential that General Giraud should be.nominated by admiral Darlan as an acceptable successor.   It was hopedthat General Giraud would be able to form an administration which would combine the various shades of French politicalopinions . V       .tIf, oh the other hand, we took Tunis, it would notbe so urgent to deal with the political situation, although this would probably have to be done before long.   If we had won a victory, our prestige would be sufficiently high toenable us to force a change without it being necessarythat Admiral Darlan should signify his assent to general giraud&apos;s as his successor.Turning to the military side of things, theFinancial Secretary said thai he had been struck by acertain lack of assurance at the Allied Headquarters inAlglerso   This was in strong contrast to the high spirits .and morale of the 8th Army.   The general opinion seemed torate our chances of taking Tunis as about fifty-fiftyQThe British troops had fought extremely wellp   Theonly criticism which he had heard had been that in the initial advance on Tunis, when troops had been rushed forward with all speed, it might have been better if they hadhalted and collected themselves before making the finalattack, which had been carried out in perhaps rather an -uncoordinated manneroParticulars were given of the events which had led to the loss by the American Combat Group Be of 1heirtanks and equipment.. 1General Anderson1 s greatest concern was his tanks,which were inferior to the Shermans and Grants with whichthe Americans were armed.   Unfortunately, the Americans hadless experience and were not so good at the tacticalhandling of their tanks.   Political grounds made it impossiblefor American tanks to be handed over to British troops.No-one seemed to be confident that the Allied airforces were being handled to the best advantage.   general eisenhower was very anxious to get Air Marshal Tedder tocome and take charge of the airjferees.   The Air Marshalhad twice been over to give advice.The system of Allied Commanders of mixed Britishand American forces was not very easy to work.   the americans had a strong feeling against accepting orders from any except American officers,,   But there was a strongdosiro  to work harmoniously, and he had never seen happierpersonal relationships than he had seen at the headquarters at Algiers. .The Americans also had a very strong feeling against separating Command of the Air units from the Army     *Oommandft * ,..  :

These ships were undoubtedly being prepared for use by the enemyi   anda number had already left Marseilles for Italian ports.,It was very desirable, therefore, that efforts shouldbe made to ^mobilise these vessels.. AdmiralCunningham had asked whether there were any political objections to the course which he had in mind.The view of the War Cabinet was that, as theproposed attack w ould be on a relatively small scale andwould probably be carried out in daylight,, there was reason to think that it oould be carried through withoutsubstantial damage to the town or heavy casualties to civilians outside the harbour.The &quot;War Cabinets.-&apos;Invited the First Lord of the admiralty to inform admiral Cunningham that HisMajesty&apos;s Government saw no politicalobjection to the course of action proposed, but assumed that he would verifyfrom General Elsenhower, if he had not already done so, that there were no localobjections on political grounds.Offices of the War Cabinet,.S.W.1*
