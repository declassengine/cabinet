(THIS OPiHIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT).most sssgket ^ faMfluested that special care may bo taken to &apos;nw Mrt JMOST SECRET.     oneuro the secrecy of this document.        copy N0*    /^ W.M.(42) 145th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 8.Confidential Annex.- -(26th October, 1948 - 5.30 p.m.) jU.S.S.R. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatat a luncheon at the Persian Legation that day, M. Maiskyhad come up to him in a stateoof considerable excitement,and had said that, as a result of instructions issued by theMinistry of War Transport, three American ships^ loaded for russia, now in Iceland were being sent back to this countryto be unloaded.     This would have a deplorable effect, inview of the difficult situation between our two countries.He (the Foreign. Secretary) had informed M. Maisky that he knew nothing of the matter, but that if the ships wereAmerican ships, it was presumably the business of theAmerican Government.     On investigation, he had found outthat the ships had been diverted by the U.S. authorities.He had therefore suggested to the latter -that in future theyshould inform the U.S.S.R. when they found it necessary tomake these changes.This incident was only another example of thesuspicious attitude which the Russians were adopting towards us.The Foreign Secretary thought that it was for cons id-eration whether he should send to M. Molotov some statementbefore M. Stalin made his speech on the 7th November.In discussion, a number of reasons were put forward for the unfriendly attitude which the Russians were adoptingtowards us.

Finally, Russian suspicions of the Hess affairwere referred to.TEE PRIME MINISTER said that on the 8th October he had,&apos;*M.(4S) sent a long telegram to M. Stalin.     This telegram had dealtJ36th with the arrangements for sending convoys to North Russia,I inclusions,       and our and the American offer to send 80 squadrons to the&quot;inate 1.        Caucasus front.      On the same day he had also sent a shorttelegram imparting to M. Stalin a piece of secret news.     Onthe 13th he had received the answer &quot;Thank you&quot;, but he hadnot been able to ascertain to which of his two telegrams of8th October this reply referred.    Meantime no progress hadbeen made with the necessary arrangements with the Russiansfor choosing lanEding-grounds, etc., to enable these 20&apos; squadrons to take station on the Russian southern front.    Wewere also without information as to whether the Russians were making the necessary movements of aircraft and submarines tohelp the ships which we were sending to Mur^Archangel.
