TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It Is requested that specrcii care may be taken tonn-nfldent-inl. Annex..(141* neoeUe-, 1942, 5.30 p.mJPRANCE.The French.Fleet at &quot;Alexandria. &apos;PreviousBReference:i W.M.(42) 162ndI Conclusions,Minute 2.)THE FIR$T SEA LORD reported&apos; to the War Cabinetthe results of   an interview between Admiral Bar theand Admiral Godfroy, in Admiral Harwood&apos;s presence(Telegram No. 1630B. of the 12th December, from theC.-in-C, Mediterranean, to, the Admiralty).Admiral Godfroy had stated that he could notcor-o ovc\&apos; to us now,    for the following reasons(a) His Squadron belonged, to France and hecould-not give it   away without knowingthat the legitimate Government of Prancewould agree.(b) He would accept the orders of a stable.&apos; Government in North Africa representingall Frenchmen outside France, but wouldnot accept .that Darlan was such a Head.\    ( c) He suggested   that M. Pietri, the Vichy-    Ambassador at Madrid, was a possible Hen ain North Africa who could rally allFrenchmen.( d) Until we had taken Tunisia we should nothave justified our claims to be able to liberate France.(e) He would not, howcr-j?, stand in the way of anyofficers and men who wanted   to    come over to our side to resume the fight.The First Sea Lord added that Admiral Harwoodthought the best plan   was to leave the situation   asit \:is    for the moment. .Any attempts to &quot;starveAdmiral Godfroy out, or to capture his Fleet,would only end in a battle in the harbour or in   the Fleet,

THE PRIME MINISTER said that Admiral Godfroy was drifting into the position of an Admiral at the head of a Fleet but who recognised allegiance to no Government.He and his Officers were being paid by us and were giving nothing in return.   The position was not one which we could allow to continue indefinitely at the same time,hewas prepared to allow the situation to continue until the end of the year, provided that Admiral Godfroy carried out his undertaking not to prevent Officers and men under his Command joining the Fighting French. He also thought that a strong effort should be made from now onwards to induce the Officers and men under Admiral Godfroy&apos;s Command to join the Fighting French.If Admiral Godfroy remained of the same opinion at the end of the year, it would be necessary to consider what further pressure should be brought to bear upon him.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs expressed agreement with this view, and attached importance to stops being taken which would afford inducements to Officers and men under Admiral Godfroy&apos;s Command to join the Fighting French organisation.

The War Cabinet endorsed the views expressed by the Prime Minister.
