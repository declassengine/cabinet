He was not, however, preparedto rule out the possibility of a separate peace with italy $   and he thought it premature to assume that nointernal convulsion in Italy could produce a Governmentwhich would be willing to make a separate peace*   Ifwe increased the severity of our pressure on Italy, theItalian people might have to choose between setting upa Government which would sue for a separate peace orsubmitting to a German occupation.   In his view, it shouldnot bo assumed that it would necessarily be in our interests that the Germans should have to occupy and takeover ItalyaPoints made in discussion were-(a)   There would be great military advantages tous in bringing Italy out of the war.   It hadbeen suggested that such a development wouldinvolve us in additional military coramitments*If, however, Italy were to seek a separate peace and then ask for our military assistance against Germany, it did not follow that weshould automatically be under an obligation toprovide such help.   We should be careful toavoid committing ourselves in advance!   our decision on such an appeal would be made atthe time in the light of circumstances as they then stood.

(b) The United States Government were very anxious tobring Italy out of the war$   and were alreadyfollowing a vigorous policy directed to that end.If; as was the case, we were in sympathy withtheir ultimate objective in this matter, weshould not leave the initiative too much with thembut should keep the closest contact,with them in.the prosecution of this policy*   The difficultieswhich had arisen in connection with Darlan1sposition in North Africa were quoted as an illustration of the importance of maintainingclose liaison with the United States Governmentin such matterso(c) Some apprehension was expressed as to the politioalconsequences of entertaining overtures for aseparate peace if they should be made by persons&quot;who.had formerly been prominently associated withOuPA^VA*&quot;^ Fascist Partjjk   Those sections of public opiniontt    which regarded this war as primarily a war to endFascism would view with suspicion anything whichcould be represented as a compromise with FascistelementSoOn the other hand it was pointed out that ourprimary war aim was the destruction of Germanj^^^oJ^-o^ Nazism and the rotontion of the countries whoseterritories had been overrun0   If at a time ofinternal upheaval in Italy an individual seizedpower and came forward with an offer to conclude a separate peacej    then, if we were satisfied thathe could bring Italy out of the war and that thiswould give us a substantial military advantage in reaching our primary objective we should not bejustified in declining to negotiate merely on theground of his past political records   We shouldnot tie our hands in advance regarding the type of italian Government with which we would beprepared to negotiate a separate peace:   thatdecision must be taken at the time on the basisof a realistic appraisal of the practicaladvantages and disadvantages involvedo(d) Meanwhile, however, no suggestion would be made thatwe should be prepared in certain circumstances tohave dealings with particular individuals(ef.g. Grandi), whose names were already beingmentioned in certain oircleso   There would be no attempt to build up any potential opponent of thepresent Fascist regime.   We must await developments and see what alternative leaders might emerge, sothat we might remain entirely free to take--dvantajro of any opportunity which might presentitself(e) The War Cabinet were informed of certain tentativeenquiries which had recently been made by individual Italians regarding the possibilityof a separate peace.   No special importance wasto be attached to any of these approaches;   butthey were straws showing which way the wind was$ Lowing, and it might well be that mor significant approaches might be made as Italy1smilitary position deteriorated.

It was not proposed that, at this stage, any response should be made to any of these approaches. The Governements of the United States and the U.S.S.R. would, however, be kept informed of the enquiries, and asked to let us know if any similar approach were made to them

The War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were as follows:-

(1)Political warfare against Italy should be conducted on the lines indicated in paragraph 15 of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum (W.P.(42) 545).

(2)Our attitude towards any Italiah overtures for the conclusion of a separate peace must be determined in the light of the situation as it existed when those overtures were made.

(3)The Foreign Secretary should take steps to inform the Governments of the United States and the U.S.S.R of the tentative enquiries recently made by individual Italians and should ask those Governments to inform us of any similar approaches that might have been made, or might in the future be made,to them.
