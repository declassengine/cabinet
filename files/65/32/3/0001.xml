MITOTE 2a -   ,Confidential Annexo v.(l2th October, 1942 - 5,30 p.ra.) \- l\THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the U-boat attacks in the South-Atlantic necessitated a reoasting of thearrangements for convoys in the South .n.tlantio*   TheUnited States had now made considerable progress withconvoy arrangements on their eastern seaboard,,-with theexception of the Trinidad area, which was still dangerous,Convoys to Sierra Leone and Gibraltar had already beendiscontinued for reasons known to the Cabinet^To avoid the dangerous Trinidad Area ships from the Indian Ocean rounding the Gape and which were sufficiently well found were routed through the straits of Magellan to ;join the convoys on the Bast Coast ofAmerica via the Panama Canal.   Past ships were routedclear of Trinidad, viatho South at la&amp;t&amp;c. Remaining ships would have to call at Trinidad.These arrangements, however, made it urgently necessary to provide escorts to deal with the U-boatswhich were now operating off the coast of South Africa^The United States were being asked to return 19 trawlersequipped for anti-submarine work which we had lent tothem some time ago and which were now employed on patrolworks   These, together with such small number of destroyers and trawlers as.we could spare, would be sent out fromthis country as soon as possiblesIt was, however, urgently necessary to meetthe situation until these ships could be made available at the Cape.   For this purpose he suggested that the destroyers belonging to the Eastern Fleet based onKilindini should be detached from that Fleet and sent tothe Cape.   This would mean that until the destroyers were returned (which would take, say, ten days) the EasternFleet, if it put to sea, would do so without anyDestroyer escort and at great risk.   The Admiraltyconsidered, however, that the Japanese were so fullyengaged in the Solomons that the risk involved was onewhich xcould-safely be taken.The First Sea Lord said that he had consulted the First Lord of the admiralty, who agreed with thecourse which he had outlined, but he thought that theCabinet should bo aware of the position and should authorise the action proposed.   The position would, of    .course, be reviewed in the event of any material changein the situation.The War Cabinet agreed with the course proposed by the First ftesj..&apos;IcBPd*-and authorised him to issue the necessary&apos; order so great George Street, S*w.loVALPBRATIOUS.   .rotection ofouth Atlanticjonvoyse
