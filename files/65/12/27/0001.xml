(40) 96th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE g.Confidential Annex.(18th April, 1940. )operations in NORWAY.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 94thConclusions,Minute 3.)Kirkenes andTromso.Narvik area.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY gave thefollowing particulars of naval movements in Scandinavianwaters:-The Admiral commanding the First cruiser squadron had reported that there v/ere 9,000 tons of oil fuel in Tromso, in shore stocks.   One Norwegianbattalion had &quot;been embarked at Kirkenes.H.M.S. WARSPITE and 3 destroyers were out on patrol 60 miles west of the entrance to the Vest FjordThe Captain of H.M.S. FAULKNER had reported thatat midnight on the 16th April he had destroyed a dumpof ammunition and petrol which had been landed by german destroyers one mile west of Herjangen.Preliminary reconnaissance to locate this dump had beencarried out by a landing party, with the loss of onerating killed.The Captain cf this ship had also sent a full report of the guns mounted around Narvik.    This report had not yet been examined in detail, but it appeared that they were a very miscellaneous collection.The convoy which had taken the troops toNarvik had returned.

Namsos area. The transport CHROBRY, escorted by H.M.S.MANCHESTER, had arrived at Namsos after dark theprevious evening.    Disembarkation had begun at  .45 p.m.  and had been completed satisfactorily.Brigadier Phillips&apos;s brigade was thus ashore.    Thefirst part of the convoy which contained the chasseurs Alpins was due to arrive off Namsos atdusk that day.Andalsnes. A force of 700 men had been landed atAndalsnes the previous night. The first contingent of Brigadier Morgan&apos;s brigade would be landed thereon the night of 18th/l9th April.THE PRIME MINISTER gave a general outline ofthe scope of Allied operations in Norway :-At Narvik,the Military Commander had been waitingunder the misapprehension that he would receivereinforcements in the shape of a detachment ofChasseurs Alpins.    These detachments had been diverted elsewhere, and he had now been askedwhether he felt able to carry out an assault onNarvik with the forces now at his disposal.As regards the force at Namsos, when the chasseurs Alpins had arrived, General Carton deWiart would have forces at least as strong as. orstronger than the total German forcesbelieved tobe in that area.    The advance from Namsos wouldtake place by two routes, which would converge atSteinkjer on the railway at the head of theTrondhjem Fjord.    The advance would then be directedon Trondhjem via Levanger.    There were Norwegianforces in this neighbourhoodwhicii would be heartenedby our advance.

The troops landing at Andalsnes would advanceas far as Dombaas, an important railway junction,which would form the right-hand pivot for any subsequent advance from the Trondhjem area inthe direction of Oslo.Main attack Very unfortunately, General Hotblack, who was toon Trondhjem.have commanded the military force in the mainattack on Trondhjem, had been knocked down theprevious night in London and had not yet recoveredconsciousness.    His place would be taken by aBrigadier specially recommended by the Chief of theImperial General Staff.    It now appeared that this attack could not take place until the 24th April.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs asked what importance should be attached to thepossibility of the Germans reinforcing Trondhjem from theair by means of troop-carriers.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had not beenconsidered that reinforcements could be sent in any great numbers in troop-carriers.    The aerodrome atVaernes was poor and had already been responsible for anumber of crashes.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that theAir Staff had calculated that the Germans had 400 to 600aircraft working in Scandinavia.    Most of these werefighters and troop-carriers, the main German bomber force having as yet been practically unused.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO asked if thejA Norwegians were blowing up the railways,

THE PRIME MINISTER understood that this hadbeen done in places; but he was sceptical about ourplacing any reliance on the Norwegians, who were offeringno serious resistance.Looking at the position generally, we could besatisfied that we had already got so many troops ashorewithout any loss, notwithstanding the risk of air attack.Looking further ahead, additional troops were beprepared for these operations and it was hoped that theAllied forces in Scandinavia would eventually amountto 50,000 - 60,000 men, about half of whom  would beFrench.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1
