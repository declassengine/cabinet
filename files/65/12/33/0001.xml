COPY NO...    /zW.M.(40)  102ND CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(24th April,  1940.)OPERATIONS Discussion took place on the general plan in NORWAY.of campaign which should he adopted on the Southern(previous reference: Front.      The following were the principal pointsW.M.(40) 101stConclusions, which emerged:-Minute 3.)(i) The immediate objective must be to preventthe Germans in Trondhjem being reinforcedfrom their main landing at Oslo.     the norwegians and Morgan&apos;s force were operating on the western line of railway,but the Germans had made an advance ofsome 60 miles in two days on this line.If the eastern line was left undefended,there would be nothing at all to stop the Germans reaching Trondhejm along it.Even if the railway were demolished in places, their light forces could stillget through.       If General Paget couldnot send a force through to the easternrailway, we should probably be unable to capture Trondhejm at all.(ii) A decision would have to be taken as to how much of General Pagefs force shouldbe sent to support the Norwegians on thewestern line,and how much could be sparedfor the eastern line.      If the Norwegianswere of little fighting value, he wouldhave to decide on his own account theposition on which he would have to standand fight.(iii) Our real objective was the control of theGallivare ore fields.      It was, therefore,all-important to clear up the situation at Narvik, and we now had authority fromthe French to divert Chasseurs Alpins tothat area.

(iv) There was, however, a close relation between the situation in the south andthe possibility of getting on to theGallivare ore fields.     Our only chanceof moving up from Narvik to Gallivarewould he if Sweden, was brought into thewar.       The surest way of compelling theGermans to infringe the neutrality of sweden would be to block their directline of approach to Trondhjem from Osloby holding both lines of railway.      Theymight then be forced to send troops throughSweden.(v) Information had been received the previous nightthat the German expedition which had beenreported as concentrating at Stettin had sailed.      It was possible that thisexpedition would be landed in Sweden.     Atelegram had therefore been sent to our military Attache in Stockholm instructing him to suggest to the Swedes that ifSweden was attacked by Germany, it wouldbe important that Swedish forces should immediately move troops from Ostersund onto Trondhjem.     We should then be in aposition to use Trondhjem as a base for subsequent operations in southernScandinavia.(vi) Unless we could find some means of takingTrondhjem within a short time, we couldnot hope to hold up the German pressure from Oslo with the small forces which wecould put in and maintain throughundeveloped bases like Andalsnes.      Inthis event the Germans would overrun thewhole of southern Norway in a few weeks,with disastrous effects upon the morale ofthe other neutrals and on world opinion,to say nothing of the disadvantages fromwhich we should suffer from the navalpoint of view.(vii) The original plan for a direct assault onTrondhjem by the use of naval forcescovering the landing of military forces had been abandoned in view of the very grave risks which would have had to be runwith a large proportion of owe availablenaval strength in an operation of which the. success would have been uncertain, and because,at the time of the abandonment of the originalplan, the pincer movement from Namsos andAndalsh es had seemed to offer better hopeof success.    This earlier hope, however,. had proved to have been tinfounded, andit was for consideration now whether some form of naval attack on theTrondhjem fjord, combined with military

landings at points where opposition was unlikely to he met. should not he under-taken.     The German Commander atTrondhjem was known to he very anxious about his position, and the arrival offurther forces to the south of him might present a favourable opportunity for a combined operation of this nature.The War Cabinet was informed that GeneralMassy was working on a plan which would be ready fordiscussion  by    the Military Co-ordination Committeelater in the day.The War Cabinet took note of theabove discussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
