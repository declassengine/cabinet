THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to(aasra?6 the secrecy of this document.MOST   SECRET,COPY NO.W.M.(4D) 58TH CONCLUSIONS * MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(2nd March, 1940).ASSISTANCETO FINLAND.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 57thConclusions yIn the course of the discussion on Minute above, THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF elaidthat he had been informed by General Gamelin of thereceipt by the French Government of the appeal for help from Finland, which had been discussed by theWar Cabinet on the previous evening.     He had dis-cussed our plans for assistance to Finland with general gamelin, who had expressed himself as perfectlysatisfied that we could do nothing more to expediteor increase the assistance which we proposed to send.General Gamelin fully appreciated that transportationfacilities in Scandinavia were the limiting factor.In the discussion which followed there was general agreement that it would be desirable forMarshal Mannerheim to be informed direct, through our military Attache in Finland, of the communications which were being sent by us to the Scandinavian andFinnish Governments-     It was possible that marshal mannerheim was not being given full information by hisGovernment of the extent of the assistance which wewere offering.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs undertook to arrange for this to be done by the-si-

VBritish Minister at Helsingfors   through the newMilitary Attache&apos;, who should also be authorised to convey a message of encouragement to Marshal Mannerheimcongratulating him on the magnificent resistance ofthe Finns.Sir Alexander Cadogan had spoken to M. Corbinabout 8 p.m. on the subject of the French reply tothe Finnish appeal.     The language which he had heldwas in accordance with the conclusions of the WarCabinet at their meeting the previous evening.He himself had seen the Finnish minister after Cabinet and had talked to him on the lines of telegram No. 95 DIPP to Helsingi*ors.     M. Gripenberghad not pressed him on the specific questions put bythe Finnish Government but only on the action whichwe should take in the event of a refusal by norway and Sweden.     To this he had replied in much the same terms as before.     M. Gripenberg had, however, seemedmuch impressed by his assurance that we should go ahead with our preparations for the despatch of theforce, whatever reply the Scandinavian Governmentsmade to our demarche.M. Gripenberg had again visited him about10 p.m. and had put the following questions to him:-(a) Would the British Government be willing tosend to Finland the necessary ground equipment and ammunition for 100 bombers?(b) When this had arrived, would we be willingto fly 100 bombers to Finland?

(c) He (M. Griperiberg) proposed to enquirefrom his Government what facilities therewere in the way of ground eouipment in finland to operate more aircraft thanthose at present possessed by the Finns.Would we be prepared to fly over and operate from Finland the number of aircraft which this ground equipmentcould maintain?(d) Could any ground equipment be flown overto Finland in special aircraft?THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that it wouldbe most unsound to send ground equipment and personnelunless it was quite certain that the bombers would besent later.     In any case to send the ground staff and equipment for 100 bombers would be a formidableundertaking and would take a very long time owing tothe inadequate transport facilities available.     Itwould also 1mean that the equivalent number of bombersremaining in this country would be to a large extentimmobilised.     If the projected operation in scandinavia did not after all come off, it would bepossible to send the squadron of Gladiators earmarked for the force, but he did not advocate this course.Consideration might also be given to sending the two squadrons of Blenheims which were packed up ready for despatch with the force.      He was not infavour of sending these aircraft, in view of the inadequacy of our own air resources in this country.He doubted whether their despatch would make any realdifference to the successful resistance of the Finns.

THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence pointed out that the chief value of sending evensmall forces to Finland would probably be the moral effect on the Finnish Government,THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF, referring tothe possibility of there being maintenancefacilities now in Finland for additional aircraft,said that as far as we knew these would only suffice for 12.There was some discussion as to the termsof the reply which should be made to M. Gripenbergon this point.     If he reported that there weremaintenance facilities for additional aircraftwe should undoubtedly be pressed to send the machines.     On the other hand, it was generally agreed that it would be undesirable to weaken ourown forces any further, particularly in view of thepossible commitment for the forces destined forScandinavia.     It was suggested that M. Gripenbergshould be informed that we could not give a definite answer until we knew the reply of the Swedes andthe Norwegians to the approach which had just beenmade.     If their reply was satisfactory, we shouldhave to send considerable air forces out of thecountry, and we could not upset all our arrangementsuntil we knew where we stood.     It should also   be pointed out that there were still a number of aircraft in process of despatch to Finland.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said thatas regards M* Gripenberg&apos;s last question, wewere already sending out ground equipment by airfor the maintenance of the aircraft which had previously been despatched.     We could not do anything more in this way.

THE SECRLTARY OP STATE FOR WAR referredto the proposed despatch of some 20 officers and in.C.0&apos;s to Finland as instructors for the anti-aircraft artillery which was &quot;being -ent to thatcountry.     He was somewhat anxious lest these men should arrive in Finland just in time to be involvedin a disaster.The view was generally expressed thatthis was a risk which we should have to take.The same considerations would apply to certainRoyal Air Force personnel which were being sent out as ground staff.The War Cabinet(1)   Invited the Foreign Secretary -&apos; (a) To arrange for all communications made by HisMajesty&apos;s Minister atHelsingfors to the finnish government to be repeated to Marshal Mannerheim by theMilitary Attache, who shouldalso convey a personal message of encouragement andcongratulation to the Marshalfrom the British War Cabinet:(b) To reply to the FinnishMinister1s questions as agreed in the discussionrecorded above,(2)   Agreed that the despatch to Finlandof British personnel as instructorsand ground staff should proceed as arranged.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
