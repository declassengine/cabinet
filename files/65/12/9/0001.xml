The FinnishGovernment1 s appeal for50 bombers.Criticism inthis country of the Govern-menfs policy towards FinlandsLord Balfour ofBurleigh andMr. M. HaroldMacmillan, M.P.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that allpreparations were being made on the assumption thatwe should actually send the 50 bombers for whichthe Finns had asked.     The Air Ministry were intouch with the Finnish Legation and with the FinnishAid Bureau so that there need be no unnecessary delay in the arrangements for the crews to become Finnishvolunteers.It was agreed that in the present state of uncertainty it was right that these preparations should be continued.Reference was also made to the suggestion,said to have been put forward by a Swedish volunteerairman who had been fighting in Finland and was nowin this country, that we should send over S00 bombers to make a single bombing attack on the Russian forcesin Finland and then to return.
