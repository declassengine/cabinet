(40) 98thConclusions,Minute 3. )Air defenceof bases.W.M.(40) 99th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.T7JF---(-eSttd April, 1940).THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that theMilitary Co-ordination Committee would examine themeasures necessary to provide for the maintenance ofthe forces as a result of the bombing of Namsos.Meanwhile the troops would have to live on the rationsthey had taken ashore with them.    It might be necessaryto develop a number of small bases on open beaches.Proper anti-aircraft defences were, of course, theprime necessity.THE FIRST SEA LORD described the arrangements being made by the Admiralty for the air defence ofthe bases.    There was to be an anti-aircraft cruiserat each port, and two carriers were embarking long-distance fighters which could maintain a patrol ofabout   4 hours duration over the port if working froma carrier 100 miles out at sea.    H.M.S. CLORIOUS had also 18 Gladiators which could be flown off on to a landing ground ashore.    The Air Staff had selected afrozen lake between Andalsnes and Dombaas for thispurpose.     The stores for this advance base would arrive in Norway about the 25th April,    The chief difficulty waspetrol, but this was being overcome by H.M.S,ARETHUSAcarrying 50 tons on her upper deck.    He emphasised thatthe use of anti-aircraft cruisers was an uncertain meansof giving anti-aircraft defence, since the whole of thedefence might be lost at one stroke if the vessel was sunk.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that Bofors guns were due to arrive at Andalsnes on the23rd April and 12 heavy anti-aircraft guns on the 25th.The Marines already had some light anti-aircraft guns&apos;with them.Command. The War Cabinet was informed that GeneralMassy had been appointed to command the whole of theforces in Norway with the exception of those at narvik.    Liaison officers from the Naval and AirStaffs were to be attached to his Headquarters, whichwas already functioning.    For the time being at anyrate   he would remain in London, but it would be ofgreat advantage to have a Commander with fullexecutive powers.Destination of The discussion then turned on the disposalreinforcements.of the various reinforcements which were en route to Norway.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that weshould have to await General Carton de Wiarfsreport before deciding whether it was possible to advance on Trondhjem from the north.    The limiting factor would be the maintenance of the troops.General Carton de Wiart had been asked whether hecould accept the second demi-brigade of ChasseursAlpins which was now at Scapa.It was intended to send the followingtroops to Andalsnes:-The remaining battalion of Morgan&apos;sBrigade, arriving on the 22nd April,15th Infantry Brigade, arriving in twoechelons on the 23rd and 25th April,

If the second demi-brigade of ChasseursAlpins could not be received at Namsos,  it would benecessary to split this contingent.     The French wouldnot like this,  and it was a point which would have tobe discussed with them in Paris.     The General Stafffully agreed with the views expressed by general gamelin that our object in the south must be at first to make certain of holding up any German advance fromOslo.     There could be no question of an immediateattack on Trondhjem by our forces in this area.    TheFrench should be told ver?/ bluntly what a hazardousoperation we were undertaking and how great our difficulties were.     They might then realise why wecould not accept their two light divisions immediately.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed.    Theposition in Norway certainly gave rise to some anxiety,but was not by any means desperate.     We had taken a risk with our eyes open, knowing that it was a veryhazardous operation to throw lightly equipped forcesashore without proper maintenance facilities.     This,however, had been the only way possible of bolsteringup the Norwegians, and as a result of what we had done the Norwegians were still holding out.Possibility of THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether it wouldattack onStavanger be possible to stage an operation to capture the aerodrome.aerodrome at Stavanger.In the discussion it was generally agreedthat it would be an extremely difficult operation, andthat the maintenance problem would be much worse thanat Namsos,  since the base for such an operation wouldbe closer to the ether German air bases-

Possibilityof equippingfighteraircraft withfloats.M. Reynaud&apos;views ofGerman intentionstowards Sweden.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER suggestedthat, in view of the difficulty of obtaining an aerodrome from which to operate fighter aircraft,these aircraft might have to be fitted with floatsand operate from fjords along the coast.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF agreed that someof the slower fighters might be fitted with floats,but at present there were no floats available.     Thematter was under urgent consideration in the AirMinistry.THE PRIME MINISTER referred to a letter hehad received from M. Reynaud, about which the WarCabinet had been informed at their meeting on the19th April, in which he said that the German intention was to get into such a position that the Swedish lineof defence on the lakes could be turned,  and that wemust take effective measures to prevent this.The Prime Minister enquired whether theChief of the Imperial General Staff agreed withM. Reynaud&apos;s line of reasoning.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that if the Germans intended to attack Sweden,then no doubt they would do so by massing troops inthe Kongsvinger area,  since an advance from therewould turn the Swedish defences, and cut off the threeSwedish Divisions which had been concentrated in theSouth.     A simultaneous landing on the shore of theGulf of Bothnia would probably also be made.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought theGermans would only attack Sweden if they feltthemselves forced to do so to secure their iron ore

supplies.      If this were so, one of our main objectives should be to make quite certain ofcapturing Narvik before the Germans could put their plan for the invasion of Sweden into operation.The French appeared to be somewhat inconsistent,since originally they had pressed the importance ofseizing Narvik, whereas now their main preoccupationappeared to be the defeat of the Germans advancingNorthward from Oslo.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR agreed,  and said that he was disturbed by the idea apparentlyheld by the French that we could ever prevent theGermans from entering Sweden behind the line of thelakes.     This they would already be able to do fromthe position they occupied in and around Oslo.Nevertheless, he hoped that we should not now switchour main efforts back on to Narvik.     He felt thatthe correct strategy would be to concentrate our efforts on the operations in Central Norway, and onlyallot to Narvik the forces which could not be madeuse of in that area.     We should., however, at oncelet Lord Cork know if he might expect reinforcementsso that he could take the fact into account whenplanning his operations.Discussion then turned upon the situationin Narvik, and the MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO enquiredwhat was the agreed plan which had been referred toin various telegrams.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY recapitulatedthe various telegrams which had passed between theWar Office and the Admiralty on the one hand, and

Admiral of the Fleet Lord Cork and General Mackesyon the other.    It had appeared that at one time the admiral and the General had been agreed on an operation which might be described as a harassingbombardment, to be f ollowed by test landings, butthe General had changed his mind after his lastreconnaissance.This apparent lack of harmony had led theWar Office to agree to subordinate the General to the admiral, who would thus be in supreme command of thewhole operation.      Lord Cork had been informed ofthis decision, but there had not yet been time for him to s ignify his intentions to the A^dmiralty.    Hewould have to review the situation in the light ofhis new powers, and there were two things on which hewould require clear instructions:    first, as to whethermore troops would be available, and when;    and,secondly, whether he could be given freedom to bombardthe town of Narvik.The first point showed how important it wasto make an early decision for the diversion of troopsfron Trondhjem.    The second point raised a questionwhich, at first sight, presented difficulties.    He(The First Lord) thought that, since it was absolutely essential for us to secure the town of Narvik, weshould give the Germans say six hours notice of our intentions, and warn the inhabitants to leave the townduring that period.    At the expiry of the notice weshould be free to bombard.

After some further discussion, it wasdecided that these two questions should be further considered when Lord Cork&apos;B report was received.In reply to an enquiry by the Ministerv/lthout Portfolio,  the SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WARsaid that General Carton de Wiart was having the landing facilities at Mosjoen reconnoitred.    the rev/as a good road between that place and Grong.    a railway was also in existence, but it was believedthat there was no rolling stock.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said thatone of the crucial points which would have to be cleared up with the French was the exact nature ofthe two operations which would be carried out by thetroops put ashore at Andalsnes.    Their role was tohelp the Norwegians to delay the German advancenorthwards, and also to assist in the reduction ofTrondhjem.    There were clearly not enough troops totake offensive action in both these directions, and itmust be decided which was the holding operation, andwhich the main objective.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR    said thatthere was clearly no possibility of a successfuloffensive southwards, and therefore we should try andhold the Germans at Lilleharnmer, and use our mainforce against Trondhjem,The War Cabinet:-Took not^ of the discussion:   and agreed: -(i) That the situation in Norwayshould be further discussed by the Military Co-co-ordination committee at a meeting to beheld later in the evening, witha view to preparing a Brief forthe use of the Prime Minister inhis discussions with the Frenchat the Supreme War Council thefollowing day.

(ii)   That as soon as Lord Cork&apos;s   report had been received, consideration should be given to the issue toLord Cork   of further instructionsinforming him(a) whether further troops would beput at his disposal.,(b) What action it was open to him totake in regard to bombardingNarvik.Richmond Terrace, 8.W.I.-8-

(40) 99TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(21st April, 1940).The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Chiefs of Staff on the air action to be takenAir Action if holland or Belgium,  in the event of a German invasion of the Low Countries,is invaded.(W.P. (40) 132).(previous reference: THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF, after brieflyW.m. (40) 92ndConclusions, summarizing the points put forward in the Memorandum,Minute 7, )invited particular attention to the view set out inparagraph 15 that a German invasion of Holland wouldbe tantamount to opening up a new phase in the war which would be a direct threat to our vital interests.At that stage, therefore, we should not hesitate to use our heavy bomber force against military objectives,both West of the Rhine and in the Ruhr itself.    TheChiefs of Staff did not feel that further discussionwith the French High Command would serve any useful purpose and recommended that the War Cabinet shouldrepresent the British view in the strongest possibleterms to the French Government,      The Chiefs of Staffrecommended that, in the last resort, the FrenchGovernment should be told that, if they could not agreeto our proposed operations, we should be compelled&apos; to reserve the right to take independent action.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR stronglyendorsed the views put forward by the Chiefs of Staffs.An attack on Holland should be regarded in exactly thesame light as an attack on Belgium and he considered it essential that we should take the same action in either case.    The French. naturally   wished to keep the war outof France as long as possible, but nothing could be more-1-

dangerous to this country than to allow the germans to establish themselves in Holland from where theirbombers could attack our South and West coastsescorted by fighters.     The possession of Hollandwould, moreover, give depth   to the German defences,and would greatly increase our difficulty in attackingobjectives in Germany.     Our only counter to theGerman advance into Holland was air attack on the heaviest possible scale against the German marshalling yards and on targets in the Ruhr.     If, on the otherhand, we allowed the French to have their way, theonly possible target for our heavy bomber force would be the advancing German troops.      It was difficult to conceive a worse or more extravagant wayof employing this immensely valuable weapon.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR thought thatthe French would use the argument that if the Belgiansrefused to help, we would not, in the event, be ableto prevent the Germans from occupying Holland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought thatthe reply to this argument was that by immediate air attack we could do the Germans a great deal of harm,but that if we delayed, the opportunity would be lost.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF added that it wasimperative that we should not surrender the initiative.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL foresaw possible dangers to the Alliance if we adopted too rigid an attitudewith the French.     He thought, however, that we should emphasise that German occupation of Holland was just as vital a matter for France as for England in thelong run.      Should our Air Force   be knocked out, the

French would have to face the full weight-..of... theGerman attack.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the War cabinet had accepted the view of the Chiefs of Staff that itwas a vital necessity for us to take air action on the.lines proposed, as soon as Germany invaded holland or Belgium.        It was quite certain that the germans would not spare civilians in their advance or intheir air attacks on what they would, no doubtrdescribe as military objectives.      He was, therefore,surprised at the French attitude.     His own view wasthat, provided we waited until the Germans launchedtheir attack, we could then hit back as hard as weliked.     He hoped that the War Cabinet would leave it to him and to his colleagues to use their best endeavours at the forthcoming meeting of the supreme war Council to convert the French to their views.The War Cabinet:-Invited the prime Minister and hiscolleagues at the Meeting of theSupreme War Council on Tuesday,23rd April, to use their best endeavours to persuade the french to accept the following policy:-That if Germany invaded holland or Belgium (or both), the allied air Forces, without further reference to the Governments,should immediately attack military objectives in Germany,  such as troop concentrations, marshalling yards,communications, and oil refineries.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
