(40) 105rd CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(25th April,    1940).THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO asked whetherit was the intention to lay mines in the Sound as wellas in the Belts.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that the twoBelts had been mined, but that no minefield had been laid in that part of the Sound which lay in SwedishTerritorial Waters. The Sound, therefore, provided a safe passage, provided the ships did not draw morethan 22 feet.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thoughtthat it was desirable to stop this gap.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that the political objections to mining that part of the Sound   which lay in Swedish territorial waters, were not sufficiently serious to deter us from doing it, if the Admiralty considered it important.    Hehad mentioned the possibility to M. Boheman who had expressed the view that Sweden would not reactviolently to the mining of the Sound.After some further- discussion, it was generally agreed that to make our mining operationsbetween Denmark and Sweden fully effective, it was desirable to lay mines in the Sound as well as in theBelts,      It-was not thought that we need make any announcement as to the laying of mines, or admit thatwe had done so.o

The War Cabinet:-(i) Authorised the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Secretary ofState for Air to arrange for minesto be laid in the Sound, notwith-standing that this meant layinga minefield in Swedish territorial waters.(ii) Agreed that it was unnecessary tomake any notification before the mines had been laid, or to admit that we had laid them.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
