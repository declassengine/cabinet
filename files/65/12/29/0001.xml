THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.COPY NO.OPERATIONS in norway.[(previous reference:fell. (40) 97th[Conclusions,minute 3. )[plans for^Operation&quot;Maurice&quot;.W.M.(40) 98th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 3.Confidential Annex.(20th April, 1940).THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY informed the War Cabinet of the changes which had been madein the plans for&quot;operation Maurice&quot; on the previous day.During the morning the Staffs had come tothe conclusion that, taking into account our success-:in getting ashore at Namsos and Andalsnes and the grave risks v/hich would have to be run in undertakingan opposed landing in the Trondhjem area, it wouldbe better to shift the emphasis from the Trondhjemlanding to the enveloping movement from the north andsouth.&quot; In the afternoon he had found the Chiefs ofStaff unanimous in their opinion that the directassault on Trondhjem should be called off, and in orderthat time and labour might not be wasted in loadingthe ships for this operation, if it was to be calledoff, he had obtained an immediate decision to that effect from the Prime Minister.The new plan was, broadly, to send the wholeof the first light Division of Chasseurs Alpins toGeneral Carton de Wiart for his attack on the Trondhjemarea from the north, and to send the Regular brigadefrom France to reinforce Brigadier Morgan, who had landed at Andalsnes and had pushed on troops to hold

Dombaas.      Another Territorial brigade would also beput in on the southern lineQ    It might be possible to push part of this southern force right forward to reinforce the Norwegians on the Oslo front.We had been fortunate in getting all our troopsashore without loss so far,  and the plans at present inhand provided for the disembarkation of some 25,000 menby the end of the first week in May.      The French had offered two further Light Divisions, and would providethe shipping for the first of these if we would transport the second division    The chief limiting factor, however,was the provision of the necessary bases and lines ofcommunication on which the forces were to be maintained,The bases would be liable to heavy air attack,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR emphasised the risks that we should have to run in putting inconsiderable forces through Namsos and Andalsnes.The new plan was indeed little less hazardous than thatof the direct assault on Trondhjem,    Until we had secured Trondhjem aerodrome, little could be done to offset the heavy scale of air attack to which our basesmight be subjected,,It was not altogether correct to say that thenew plan was for a -.&quot;pincer&quot; movement against Trondhjem,since, while the northern force would be bringing pressure to bear in the near future, it would be a considerable time before the southern force could move againstTrondhjom,    The first care of the southern force must beto secure themselves against a German attack from thesouth, for which purpose a considerable proportion of theforce would have to be used.    It might well be a monthbefore any serious move could be made against Trondhjemfrom the south,

THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff explained that General Carton de Wiart, when reinforced bythe. Prenchj  would have quite a large force at his disposal, aconsiderable proportion of which would be highly mobile.If he could get astride the railway from Trondhjem to sweden the Germans would be hemmed in from the north.The next stage would be to get troops up to Storen tobring pressure to bear from the south.    The troops now atDombaas had no guns or transport, and were therefore notin any condition to fight a serious action.    They should,however, be able to hold a defensive position.    In additiondemolition parties were being sent to prepare demolitionson the two railways running north from Oslo towardsTrondhjem.    These would be blown up at our .orders, and notat those of the Norwegian Command.    One of our difficulties would probably be the question of the command of theAllied and Norwegian forces in Norway.      The militaryefficiency of the Norwegian Commanders and Staff wasnot very great, but the Norwegian Commander at Lillehammerwas already trying to issue orders to Brigadier Morgan.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR informed theWar Cabinet that Lieut.-General Massy, the.Deputy Chiefof the Imperial General Staff, had been appointed to command all the forces in Norway, with the exception ofthose at Narvik which would remain an independent command for the time being.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked whether the changeof plan for the Trondhjem operation would involve aconsiderable delay in carrying it out.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thata direct assault on Trondhjem had been felt to involveundue risks both for the Fleet and for our landingparties.     If,  in the course of a successful assault,the Fleet were to lose a capital ship or some other important unit as a result of enemy air action, thisloss would have to be set against the success of theoperation.     Again, it was rbvious that the landingparties might suffer heavy casualties and GeneralMassy, who had now been given charge of the operation,took the view that the stake was disproportionate tothe result, particularly as the latter could beobtained by other methods.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that thematter might be put in the following way.      It wasnot fair to ask the Navy to run great risks unlessthe certainty existed that great military results would follow.     In actual fact, however, the subsequentmilitary operation would itself be a very risky one.He thought that public opinion abroad was already beingimpressed by the fact that we were able to land our troops in Norway without undue difficulty.The War Cabinet endorsed the action takenin modifying the plan for the operation against Trondhjem&apos;,.S. THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatall four transports of the first French convoy had arrived at Namsos and had completed disembarkation.The second convoy of three ships, escorted by two destroyers, was expected in the Clyde that morning.snes area. The landing of Brigadier Morgan1s brigadehad been completed without opposition.

H.MoS, CARLISLE- ASHANTI ana MOHAWK werepatrolling off Aalesund.H.M.S. BLACK SWAN was at Molde, preparing for a possible landing of a small force of marinesat Vinje.H.M.S. AUCKLAND was at Aalesund.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that.M.S. FURIOUS was on her way to Harstad and would operate aircraft against Narvik that morning if the weather was suitable.     As a result of the damageshe had sustained from the previous day&apos;s air attackher speed had been reduced to 22 knots.H.M.S. IKARSPITS, together with her escort,had been ordered to return to the Narvik area as she would no longer be required for &quot;Operation Maurice&quot;.Lord Cork and Genera] Wackesy were in close touch at Narvik and some progress in that area mightbe hoped for soon0     At the same time, v/e must face the fact that there might be as many as 5,000 of theenemy in the area.     Narvik was of vital importanceto us,  and it was essential that it should be in our hands in good time before the ice melted in the BalticUnless we had the area in our control and our forcesestablished on the Swedish frontier, and werein a position immediately to interfere with the ore-fields if necessary, the Germans would be very likelyto demand from Sweden the right to reinforce their troops as soon as their shipping could get up toLulea.     We had therefore only a month in which to liquidate the position at Narvik, and it was of theutmost importance not to have our attention divertedby operations elsewhere from our principal objective,which had always from the very start been the controlof the Gallivare ore-fields.

SHE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF,  in answer to a question,  said that there should he no particular difficulty in getting a small force through,even if the railway had not been repaired.     As faras we knew, the damage to it was not very serious.A small force firmly ensconced was very difficult   to turn out of its position in the difficult country inwhich the operations would be taking place.     Weshould take the first opportunity to reorganise theNorwegian forces operating in norther Scandinavia and use them to assist us in that area.The War Cabinet took note of the abovediscussion.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thoughtthat it might be a good thing if a Pre?.0. comm^Jiiqua&apos;were now to be issued to the effect &apos;:.nat we had nowcarried out a number of successful disembarkationsin Norway,  that some thousands of troops had been landed without casualties or other mishaps,  and that none of our ships taking part in the landing operationshad been hit.The War Cabinet approved the issue of a press communique to the above effect.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
