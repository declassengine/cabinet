(40) 104thConclusions,Minute 3.)COPY NO./W.M.  (40) 105th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex. -;-(27th April, 1940.)THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat,as arranged at a meeting held the previous night,I(See Minute 4) the Chiefs of Staff had had a meeting that morning with General Gamelin and the French Staffsin regard to the situation in Norway.    This meeting had just ended.General Gamelin had made two suggestions:-(i) That, as a preliminary to the occupation of narvik, the troops at Namsos should he usedto occupy as many points as possible on thecoast running north from Namsos,(ii) That the forces south of Trondhjem should beused to establish themselves in a widespreadbridge-head, which would cover Christiansund-Molde-Andalsnes-Aalesund.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff had said that the difficulties in carrying out these suggestions were enormous, and that one of the greatest would be themaintenance of the forces involved.    In addition, ifforces were to be landed in small detachments at placesalong the coast, motor boats would be required and therewould be the difficulty of feeding so many small detachments.Further, the troops would have no A.A. protection, barbed wire, or guns.    General Gamelin had suggested landing afurther division, but it had taken us    10   days to land5 battalions.    He (the Chief of the Imperial General Staff)did not consider General Game1in&apos;s suggestions practicable.They only multiplied the difficulties of maintenance.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff addedthat he had never been frightened of the effect of bombing on troops in the field, but bombing of baseestablishments made the maintenance of the forces almostan impossibility;The Chief of the Imperial General staff,continuing, said that General Massy had been studying theproblem and considered that we should evacuate our forces.There had been further reports from General Paget, whohad come to the conclusion that if the Andalsne.s force was embarked on the night of the 1st/2nd May, it mightbe possible to get them away without much loss, but thatif the operation was not carried out by that date, itwould be necessary to reinforce the Andalsnes force inorder that it could resist the German advance.    TheChief of the Imperial General Staff added that our troopsin this area had been in contact with the enemy and hadinflicted heavy losses upon them.With regard to the Namsos area, there were too many troops there and they had not sufficient manoeuvringspace.    Orders had been given that every.ship leavingNamsos should take on board some French troops.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY demurred toan immediate withdrawal and wished further consideration-to be given to leaving the troops now in Norway to put up the best fight they could, in conjunction with the norwegians.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that hehad received the most urgent appeals from Sir Roger Keyesto carry out an operation of the &quot;Hammer&quot; type.   AdmiralKeyes had offered to take command of the operation.    Hehad had an interview with the Chief of Naval Staff, but--2r

was insistent that he should he-allowed to see- thePrime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he hadreceived a request for an interview from Sir RogerKeyes hut, as he had understood that the First Lordof the Admiralty had declined to grant him an inter-view, he    (the Prime Minister) had said that he couldnot see Admiral Keyes.      In the circumstances, hesuggested that the First Lord might hear whatAdmiral Keyes had to say.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY undertook to do this.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
