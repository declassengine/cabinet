Air action in regard torivers and canalssupplementary to royal marine operations the French had expressed a desire that thequestion of stopping Swedish supplies of ore to germany from Lulea should be studied, and M. Reynaud hadenquired whether we had considered employing aircraft for this purpose.    He had been informed that a plan ofthis kind was being examined j   and it had been agreedthat plans should at onoe be prepared by the Britishand French Staffs for interrupting traffic from Luleaas soon as the Gulf of Bothnia became ice-frees

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that itwas proposed that three areas in norwegian territorial waters should he selected as prohibitedareas, though in fact at the beginning of the operationit was proposed to lay mines in only two of these areas.    He suggested that instead of giving a preliminar-ary warning, it would be better to lay the minefieldwithout warning, but to station patrol craft outsidethe area for a period of forty-eight hours thusensuring that no neutral vessels entered the minefieldunwarned.    It was very desirable that no Norwegianwarships should be present while the mines were being laid, but if any such ship did appear, the mine-layingwould proceed nevertheless;   orders had been given that, if a Norwegian warship were to attempt to intervene, only the minimum action should be taken whichmight be necessary to make her desist.    Each of thethree areas selected had   been specially chosen to ensurethat the laying of a minefield   would not prevent accessby sea to any Norwegian town or village.    Each minefieldwould extend for six miles from the shore, and could helaid in a period of half an hour.    It was not intended togive orders to interfere with Norwegian mine-sweepers,should these attempt to clear a passage, nor was it proposed, at this stage at any rate, to make use of devicesto render the mines difficult to sweep.A discussion then ensued on the details and the timing of, and the announcements to be made in connectionwith, the Norwegian Territorial Waters and Royal MarineOperations, in the course of which attention was drawn to the following considerations :-

is SB(i) The Royal Marine Operation was an operation ofa novel character, and the French were anxious that at the appropriate time a puhlicannouncement should he made justifying it.The general lines of this announcement would necessarily he similar to those followed inthe public announcement to be made in regardto the Norwegian Territorial Waters Operation.(ii) In these circumstances it would be ofadvantage, if possible, so  to time the two operations as to enable a single public announcement to be made dealing with both.(iii) If only one public announcement was to be made,it might be necessary to adjust the provisionaltime table in such a way as to make the two operations synchronise with one another.(iv) It was important that the public announcement in regard to the operation in norwegian territorial Waters should be so drafted thatwe justified our action in -violating norwegian territorial waters, not upon the previousviolations   of Norwegian territorial waters byGermany, but on the wider ground of the numerous violations of International Law byGermany at sea.(v) M, Rsynaud had made it clear that the final approval of the French Government to the RoyalMarino   Operation depended upon the consent ofthe French War Committee, which, however, hewas hopeful of obtaining.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat, in view of the action contemplated, it was very important that the right steps should be taken by the Ministry ofInformation to prepare public opinion in this country, in scandinavia and elsewhere.    It was particularly important that people generally should realise to the full the atrociousmethods which the Germans were following in their sea warfare.He proposed, therefore, to see the Minister of information and to tell him what we had in mind so that   he could takethe necessary action.    He would propose also to send aTelegram to His Majesty1s Ambassador in Washington giving him a full account of bur intentions for communication to president Roosevelt very shortly before action was to betaken.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY drew attention to the possibility that the proposed aotionin Norwegian Territorial Waters might lead the germans to take forcible action against Norwegian territory and so give us an opportunity for landing forces onNorwegian soil with the consent of the norwegian government.     It would seem to be important that weshould continue in a state of readiness to despatch a light force to Narvik, and possibly also the forcethat had been planned for Stavanger.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that itwas, of course, now out of the question to send thetwo divisions previously prepared for the mainScandinavian expedition;   but the brigade which ithad been intended should go to Narvik was stillavailable, and the force for Stavanger formed partof a division which was not due to go oversea tillMay.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that theChiefs of Staff Committee were proposing to submit aReport to the War Cabinet as soon as possible on theaction, which the Germans were likely to take,and thearrangements which should be made to enable us to counter any such action without delay.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that he proposed to make a full communication tothe Dominion Governments regarding the questions dealtwith at the meeting of the Supreme War Council, otherthan those relating to military operations.      he intended to make no reference to the Royal marine operation, but he would like to be able to inform theDominions of the action proposed to be taken in regard

to Norwegian Territorial Waters, adding merely thatsome operation from French territory would he under-taken simultaneously.The War Cabinet(I) Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the First lordof the Admiralty to prepares-(a) A detailed scheme setting out thedate and time at which So(i) The Royal Marine operation should be begunI(ii) The notification regardingthe Royal Marine operation should be made to the belgian and Netherland Governmentsj(iii) The Norwegian territorial waters Operation should behegani(iv) The Norwegian and swedish government should be informed of (iii) above;(v) The public announcement orannouncements in regard tothe above Operations shouldbe issued;(b) The draft of the warnings andthe public announcements to bemade in regard to the aboveoperations.(tl) Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs:(a) To tell the Minister ofInformation of the action whichit was proposed to take in norwegian Territorial Waters, sothat he could take suitable stepsto prepare public opinion.(b) To give full information to thePresident of the United Statesthrough His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Washington shortly before theaction was to be taken.

(III) Took note that the Chiefs of staff committee would submit as soon aspossible a Report on action likelyto be taken by the Germans as aresult of our action in norwegian territorial Waters, and the arrange-ments which should be made to enableusjto counter any such action with-out delay.(IV)   Approved the line which theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs proposed to take inmaking a communication to theDominion Governments in regardto the meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil held the previous day.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
