THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.COPY NO.OPERATIONS in norway.(previous^Reference:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 5. )Narvik.W.M.(40) 93rd CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(15th April,1940)THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY informed theWar Cabinet that a report had been received on theprevious day from the Master of a Norwegian FisheriesProtection Cruiser to the effect that 1,500 german troops were in the vicinity of Narvik, and that a further700 had landed at Herjangen (some 25 to 30 miles north of Narvik).

General Maekesy must act in concert.    Beyond this the decision as to what action should be taken had clearly to be left to the Naval and Military Commanderson the spot.The general indications were that Narvikwas going to prove a military proposition and that wecould not count on taking it without resistance.    Theneed remained, however, to clear the Germans out of narvik as soon as possible.    The position that night would

be that we should have landed one Brigade, and that thiswould be in touch with the Norwegians.Trondhjem The object of Operation &apos;Maurice&apos; was toand Namsos.capture Trondhjem, and the first phase of it was toestablish a force ashore at Namsos as soon as possible,A Naval landing-party of 300 men from two Cruisers(Force  &apos;Henry&apos;) had landed there the previous night.Local inhabitants had said that there were no Germanswithin 60 Kilometres.    In view of the paramountnecessity of getting a force ashore in the Trondhjemarea, and on the strength of the naval success at Narvikon 13th April, it had been the intention to follow upthe Naval landing at Namsos with a landing by the 146thBrigade.    This Brigade had originally been destined forNarvik but it had been decided on the previous afternoon to divert it towards Namsos, where it had been ordered toarrive at dusk that evening.Reports from our forces at Namsos had meanwhilebeen received tending to show that a further landingmight prove very difficult.    Namsos was under four feet of snow and offered no concealment from the air.    Localdeployment before reaching sparsely wooded country wasimpossible.    Namsos itself was a very small place, hadbeen partially evacuated, and was short of fresh water.There was some motor transport and also rolling stockon the single track railway, but details were notavailable.    It was considered that the southward movementof any force larger than one battalion would be slow andconspicuous from the air.    The Norwegians had estimated the total enemy strength in the area at 1,600, and thatthere was no enemy North qf Hell.    The Norwegian strengthwas uncertain.

In the light of these reports the Chiefs ofStaff had met that morning and had. agreed that it would&quot;be unwise to attempt the proposed further landing by* the 146th Brigade that night, and that   the Brigadeshould be held away from Namsos until the position wasclearer. The transports had accordingly been divertedand the Staffs were now at work looking for some otherplace at which the 146th Brigade might be landed. Mean-while General Carton de Wiart, in command of Operation1Maurice&apos; would be carrying out a reconnaissance.The First Lord impressed upon the War Cabinetthe very hazardous nature of this Operation,  not only onaccount of the terrain and of the exposure of the landingforces to air attack, but also owing to the fact that themajority of the troops to be employed were not highly trained..alesund. Meanwhile a subsidiary Operation  &quot;Primrose1was in progress, under which 600 marines and seamenhad sailed from Rosyth the previous night in 4 sloopsequipped with good anti-aircraft armament,    It was intended that this force should land at Aalesund Islandon the 17th April in order to command the approaches toTrondhjem from this direction.As regards the future, the First Lord said thatthe Commander-in-Chief had not been very keen on forcinghis way into Trondhjem because of the risk of air attack.A telegram has been sent to him explaining that the riskof air attack did not apply only at Trondhjem, and that hewould be exposed to it wherever he might be within reach of enemy bombers.    The French contingent,  comprising the chasseurs Alpins who were probably the best troops in theworld, were now on their way and should be ready to sailinto Trondhjem on about the 18th, and it was possible that by then the situation at Narvik might be sufficientlyfree to permit of reinforcements being sent from there toTrondhjem.

deposed Attack* Stavangerprodrome.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that theChiefs of Staff proposed to reinforce the Navallanding-party at Namsos with one Battalion from the146th Brigade, and to land the rest of this Brigadeat some other point.     Consideration was being givento the following places, among others:-(i)    Romsdal Fjord, south of Trondhjem.This suffered from the disadvantagethat the risk of air attack wouldbe increased.(ii)   Mo, 150 miles north of Namsos.(iii)   Harstad,  the advance base for Narvik.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSappreciated the dangers and difficulties of proceeding with the landing at Namsos, and agreedthat the War Cabinet must be guided by the advice of the Staffs in this matter.     At the same time, he emphasised the great political importance ofestablishing ourselves in the Trondhjem area, andurged that this should be done as soon as might bepossible.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed disappointmentthat it had been found necessary to delay ourlanding in the Trondhjem area, but considered thatthis was preferable to running the risk of a bigreverse, which should be avoided at all costs.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that.M.S. SUFFOLK had been ordered to carry out abombardment of Stavanger aerodrome with her 8&quot; gunsat daybreak on Wednesday morning.      She would beescorted by AoA. ships.

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that he had ordered a long-range &quot;bombing squadron to an aerodrome in Scotland, and it was hoped that thesebombers would be able to reach Trondhjem aerodrome.M.S.  ILLUSTRIOUS.   - THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY,continuing,  said that great efforts were beingmade to hasten the completion of H.M.S. ILLUSTRIOUS.This   aircraft carrier would be most useful inthe operations off the Norwegian coast as shepossessed an armoured deck.The War Cabinet:-(l)    Took note of the present positionof operations in Norway, as reported above.(2)   Endorsed the recommendation ofthe Chiefs of Staff to restrictfurther landings at Namsos toone Battalion, pending aclarification of the situation,and the consequent diversion ofthe 146th Brigade (less the battalion to be landed at Namsos)to some other point,  to bedecided, on the Norwegian coast.(3)   Reaffirmed the importance whichthey attached to the occupation ofTrondhjem by Allied troops at theearliest possible moment.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
