(40) 77thConclusions,Minute 1. )t Invasion ofj Holland, Belgiumi intervening,Confidential Annex.(12th April, 1940).The War Cabinet had before them a Note bythe Chairman of the Military Co-ordination Committeecovering a Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the actionto be taken in the event of an impending attack or ofan actual invasion of Holland or Belgium (W.P.(40)  126).It was agreed in a preliminary discussion ofthe paper that if the Germans were to obtain navaland/or air bases in Holland by bringing pressure tobear on the Dutch, in the same way as the russians had done in Esthonia, a step would have been taken which would directly threaten our vital interests,. andthat the case would have to be treated in the same way as if Germany had actually invaded Holland.So far as an invasion of Belgium was concerned,it was recalled that it had been agreed with the Frenchat the 6th Meeting of the Supreme War Council that, if germany invadad Belgium, Allied forces should immediately move into that country without waiting for a formal invitation to do so.      It had also beenagreed, at the same meeting of the Supreme War Council,that if Belgium went to the help of Holland, the allies would immediately support Belgium.

Invasion of The more difficult case was that of a GermanHolland, Belgiumneutral. invasion of Holland and a Belgian refusal to go to theassistance of Holland.    This particular hypothesiswas considered at considerable length.      In the dis-cussion the following were the principal points thatemerged(i)    Prom the military point of view it wouldbe most desirable to march into Belgium atonce, otherwise the Germans, by their occupation of Holland, would outflank thelines in Belgium which offered the bestdefensive positions.      Speed would be essential, and precious hours would be lost if v/e had to wait for a formalinvitation from Belgium.      In the absenceof an invitation from Belgium, it would benecessary to move with some caution.      Thefirst bound would be to the line of the scheldt, which would be made good by themain bodies, while the light mechanisedforces moved on to the line   of the Dyle.If the Belgian attitude proved satisfactory,the main bodies would then advance to this second line^       Without Belgian co-operation,however, our forces would be in a dangerousposition on this latter line, which wasflanked at each end by Belgian fortresses.

(ii)   The ready co-operation of the Belgians was clearly of the highest importance, and itwas therefore necessary to take no actionwhich might antagonise them.     A &quot;preventiveadvance into their country might well have this effect, though it was certainly very doubtful whether they would ever he drivenso far as to throw in their lot on theGerman side.     The French were in very close toucu with Belgian opinion and wouldhe the best judges of the probable reactions of Belgium.(iii)   The possibility could not be excluded that belgium would attempt to maintain her neutrality even after Holland had beeninvaded.      She might be tempted to do soby assurances from Germany that in this event she would hot be molested.      Theterms of the recent communique issued bythe Belgian Government (See Telegram No.64from Brussels) might indeed indicate thatsuch was the policy of Belgium, though itwas possible, of course, that thiscommunique was a facade only, behind whichthe Belgian Government might be preparedto negotiate with us secretly,(iv)    If Belgium did attempt to maintain her neutrality after the invasion of Holland,and the Allies marched in from the West,the Germans would be practically certain to advance into Belgium from the East whateverassurances they might have given previously.In these circumstances, Belgium would haveno other option but to enter the war on our side.

-    173-(v)    If Germany invaded Holland, the Allies would suffer an enormous loss of prestige if they stood by and did nothing at all.     for political reasons, therefore,  as well as military,  there seemed every reason to advance into Belgium without delay Immediately,Germany invaded Holland.The War Cabinet agreed that in theevent of a German invasion of Holland,the right policy to pursue would be to march into Belgium at once.Communication to Considerable discussion then followed onbe made toBelgian &quot;the question as to whether our intention to advanceGovernment.into Belgium in this contingency should be disclosed to the Belgian Government or not.It was argued on the one hand that we had used every means of persuasion,  short of threats, to try and induce the Belgians to concert with usarrangements for their defence.     We had so far been unsuccessful, but M. Spaak in his most recentcommunication had indicated that if the Allies would undertake to advance as far as the Albert Canal-MeuseLine, a new situation would arise.      It might,therefore, be better to tell the Belgians quite bluntlythat we were inflexibly resolved to advance into their country,  if Holland was invaded, in order tosafeguard our own interests.     We should,  at the sametime, emphasise that if they would co-operate with us, we should,  as we had already stated, make every endeavour to hold the line of the Albert Canal and thereby preserve as much as possible of Belgiumintact.

It was pointed out, on the other hand, that wehad given Belgium a definite assurance, at the timethe Locarno Treaty lapsed, that we would respect her neutrality.    This need not necessarily deter us from making such a blunt declaration to Belgium as had been proposed, but it was a factor which would have to beborne in mind when considering the reply which Belgiumwould be likely to give to a communication in theterms suggested.    It might, therefore, be better togive the Belgian Government a broad hint only.Any communication made to the Belgian Government would,of course, have to be agreed with the French.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs read over a first draft of a communication to theBelgian Government.    It was generally agreed that itwould be preferable to take the stronger line and saythat in the contingency envisaged &quot;we should feelourselves obliged&quot; to enter Belgium.    The French would doubtless, however, have strong views on the matter,and it would be as well for our Ambassador in Paris tohave a milder formula in reserve, e.g.  that &quot;we should reserve our liberty of action&quot;.Air Policy if The War Cabinet then considered the actionHolland is:invaded. which should be taken by the Allied air forces inthe event of a German invasion of Holland.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out thatour present policy in this contingency was not to initiate air attack: on objectives in Germany, but simply to attack the German columns advancing into Holland.Moreover, this action was only to be taken from thiscountry, and not by forces flying across Belgium..    TheChiefs of Staff had now reconsidered this question,  and&apos;5w

were of the opinion that the moment the Germansentered Holland or Belgium, or both, the Royal AirForce should he authorised, without further discussion, to attack those objectives most calculated to dislocate the German plan.    These objectives, whichwere set out in paragraph 6(d)(ii) of the Report,included troop concentrations, marshalling yards,communications, and also those targets vital to theGerman war effort as a whole, situated in the areaimmediately behind the German advance, e.g. oil refineries in the Ruhr.    The time factor was the vitalconsideration.    With every mile the Germans advancedinto Holland and Belgium, the depth of the defencescovering these vital points increased,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was entirely in favour of taking all possible action to stop theGerman advance, but he was not certain of the reasons which led to the proposal to bomb the oil refineries.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that the sooner we could start the attack on Germany&apos;s vitalspots, the better.    It was no longer intended to matemass attacks on these heavily defended objectives in clear weather.    The bombing would be done in conditionsof good cloud cover, or at night.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that thequestion whether to bring on the total air war, whichmust inevitably result from attacks on objectives inGermany of the type specified, demanded serious consideration.    The Air Staff held the view, withwhich he agreed, that it would be rash to begin itexcept as part of a general battle which might provedecisive.    The great air attack should coincide withthe great land -battle,

He had been much impressed by the view expressed by the Chief of the Imperial General Staffon a previous occasion, of the tremendous effect likelyto result from a simultaneous air attack on the rear of the German Army, and on those great industrialobjectives which were adjacent.    If, therefore, Germanyinvaded Holland, and the Allied Armies advanced into belgium, he had no hesitation in recommending that air action against the objectives proposed should be initiated without a moment&apos;s delay.There was a slight chance that the Frenchmight not agree to the allied Army entering Belgiumwithout an invitation,  in which case it was justpossible that the Armies might not move, and it wouldbe left to the Royal Air Force alone to act.    unless their action was quick, and directed against Germanyherself, the effect on world opinion might be disastrous.He therefore felt that the Chiefs of Staff were right in recommending that immediately the Germansbegan their attack on either Holland or Belgium, our air action against Germany should start.-THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed withthis view.    He pointed out, however, that it would benecessary to get the French also to agree.    A successfulGerman advance into Holland would constitute such a dangerous threat to the Belgian defences that it wouldbe necessary at all costs for the Allied Armies to advance to the j\ntwerp-Namur line.    He hoped, therefore,that the French would be ready to fall in with our views:on air action, since the bombardment of military objectives calculated to dislocate the German advance would &quot;be of very great assistance to the French Army.

There was general agreement that thepolicy recommended by the Chief of the Air Staff wasthe right one, and that the concurrence of the FrenchGovernment should immediately be sought.Timing of The War Cabinet then considered the ChiefsMilitary andAir action.        of Staff proposal that,when it was certain that theGerman attack was about to be launched on eitherHolland or Belgium, the Allied armies should advanceinto Belgium and also air attacks on Germany shouldbe started the night before the German attack.Amongst the arguments in favour of such acourse were the following:-(a) Very great military advantage would be gained if the Allied Armies could make a night advance to the line Antwerp-Namur,unmolested by air attack.(b) The opening of the German attack would bethe signal for unlimited air warfare.    Ifwe could forestall the German initiative in jthe air war, we would get a great chance ofdislocating their plan, and checking their advance before we were ourselves subjected to overwhelming air attack.     Recent events had clearly demonstrated the enormousadvantage gained by the side which possessedthe initiative.On the other hand it was argued:-(a)    It could not be known for certain that theGerman attack would start on any particularday.      It was recalled that in january the Belgians had been convinced that anattack was about to take place;    but theyhad been wrong.

(b) Alternatively, if the Allies were quite certain that an attack was totake plaoe within 24 hours, it wouldalso be apparent to the Belgians;in which case the Belgian Governmentwould almost certainly invite theAllied armies into their country.(c) If the Allies started their movement the night before an attack was expected, it would be open to theGermans to hold back their attack24 hours.      That would give themtime to expose   to the world ourviolation of Belgian neutrality andthe initiation by us of warfareagainst civilians, and would enablethem to proceed with their planswith all the moral advantages ontheir side.(d) It was inconceivable that the french would agree to initiate unlimitedair warfare before the battle had actually started.The War Cabinet agreed that on balance thearguments were overwhelmingly against the proposal bythe Chiefs of Staff, and that in consequence itshould not be put before the French, either on theHigh Command level or through Diplomatic channels.Communication The War Cabinet then considered the best to the French.manner in which the conclusions which had been reachedshould be put to the French.    It was felt that Frenchagreement should immediately be sought to a jointcommunication being sent to the Belgians, on the linesof the Craft read out by the Foreign Secretary,defining the allied attitude in the contingency of aGerman invasion of Holland, as it had been brought outin the discussion.    It was thought that at the sametime our proposals for air action in the event of an invasion of either Holland or Belgium should be put to the French.       Time was short, and it was essentialthat this point should be cleared up in advance of theevent.    It was assumed that, if the French agreed to our air policy in the event of an invasion of Holland, theywould also agree to the simultaneous execution of theRoyal Marine Operation, since they had agreed to it inthe event of a general attack in the west.-9-

The War Cabinet:-(l) Took note of the Report by.the Chiefsof Staff on the action to be taken inthe event of a German invasion of holland or Belgium.    (W.P.(40) 126).(2) Agreed that if the Germans invadedHolland alone, and Belgium neitherwent to her assistance, nor invited the Allies to pass through hercountry to do so,  the French andBritish forces should neverthelessimmediately advance into Belgium.The cession under threat of basesby Holland to Germany would, for thispurpose, be considered as the same asan invasion.(3) Agreed that the Belgian Governmentshould be given a joint communicationby the British and French Governments,to the- following effect:-(a) That if Holland is attacked, andBelgium goes to her assistance,the Allies will support Belgiumwith all the forces in their power immediately.(b) That the Allied Governments are unwilling to believe that, if holland is attacked, the BelgianGovernment would not go to her assistance;    but that, if theBelgian Government did not do so,the Allied Governments would feel obliged to order their forces to enter Belgium, withthe object of assisting Holland,and of safeguarding the security and vital interests of belgium and of the Allies.(4) Agreed that if Germany invaded holland or Belgium, or both -(a) The Allied air forces, withoutfurther reference to their governments, should immediatelyattack military objectives inGermany, such as troop concen-trations, marshalling yards,communications, and oil refineries.(b) The Royal Marine Operation shouldbe carried out.

(5) Agreed that the Allied forces should not.   advance into Belgium or attack(L^-^aM^ fc^std^r1&quot;&quot; pi-y^-^c in Germany as in (4)fijsV &amp; J above, unless Germany had firstcommitted an act of hostility againstHolland or Belgium.(6) Agreed that the conclusion in (5) ahoveshould not, of course, he taken to mean that the Allies should refusear. invitation from the BelgianGovernment to enter their country before any act of hostility had been committed by Germany against holland or Belgium.(7) Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to send an immediatecommunication to the Ambassador inParis inviting the French Government(i) To agree to the policy set outin (2),  (4),  (5) and (6) above.(ii) To agree to the despatch, onbehalf of the British and french governments,  to the BelgianGovernment of a communication onthe lines set out in 3 (a)  and(b) above.      The ambassador should also be told that if theFrench Government were unableto agree to the communication to the Belgian Government insuch strong terms, he should suggest the substitution ofthe words&quot;The Allied Governments reserve their liberty of action to goto the assistance of Holland&quot;for&quot;The Allied Governments would feel obliged to order their forces to enter Belgium withthe object of assisting Holland&quot;in the communication.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.tr

4 cX^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET,.W.M.  (40) 90th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 5,Confidential ^annex.(12th April, 1940)./A/COPY NO.OPERATION&quot;RUPERT&quot;.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 89thConclusions,Minute 3.)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs drew attention to Telegrams Nos. 205 and 206 from Stockholm, containing messages from His .Majesty&apos;minister in Norway in which he stressed the desirabilityof early military operations in Southern Norway.     TheNorwegian Government were anxious to instal    themselvesin Trondhjem as early as possible.He felt that operations at Narvik, howeversound from the military point of view, would have verymuch less political effect than an attampt to clear the Germans out of the Southern part of Norway.    The..enemy was thrusting forward to the southward fromTrondhjem and Northward from Oslo.    If these two forcessucceeded in joining hands, they would have the whole ofSouthern Norway under their control.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointedout that an opposed landing at Trondhjem would be avery difficult operation, and if mounted without proper preparation might only lead to a bloody repulse.Preparations for an expedition to Narvik were well advanced and the landing would be made within a fewdays.    We could be reasonably sure of a success at that point, and a success would show that we should be ableultimately to clear the Germans out of all the ports in

which they had obtained a foothold.     Plans foran operation at Trondhjem were being examined bythe Staffs,  and the Naval Staff would also be putting up proposals for minor landings at Namsosand Molde.     The Military Go-ordination Committeewould examine these projects and report as soon aspossible to the War Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR observedthat the assistance of French troops would berequired for a landing at Trondhjem, and the french had insisted that the Narvik operation should becarried out first.It was generally agreed that landings onthe Norwegian coast even on a small scale wouldhave an important political effect and from that point of view were desirable, but that -ftiey should nothecarried cut at the cost of a   diversion of effort fromthe Narvik expedition now in course of preparation.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.V/.1.
