(40) 86thConclusions,Minute 1.)It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.GOBY IP.   IC?W.M. (40) 87th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 5oConfidential Annex0(10th April, 1940.)In connection with the account given of the7th Meeting of the Supreme War Council, a preliminary discussion took place as to our strategic policy in scandinavia oTHE PRIME MINISTER said that, since theCouncil&apos;s Meeting, we had obtained a good deal more information;) and we must revise our ideas of thesituation in Norway.     The Germans had seised the portseffectively, and to dislodge them would he a difficultoperation.    They could reinforce Stavanger, Bergen andTrondhjem from Oslo.     The conclusion which he drew fromthe facts was that Narvik, which for another month wouldbe isolated, offered the only possible objective for an allied attack.    The French had assured us that theircontingent was ready and willing to participate in an expedition.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed thatthe Scandinavian position must be reviewed as a whole,A preliminary meeting of the Military Co-co-ordination committee had been held the evening before, and it hadbeen established that if Narvik were held toy three orfour thousand Germans, which was believed to he thesituation, it would absorb all our available forces to turn them out.     We should not dissipate our forces toytrying to recapture Bergen and Trondhjem, tout should concentrate on making a plan for the recapture of Narvik

at the earliest possible moment.Although the extent of the Germans&apos;,tactical success should not he minimised, the FirstLord expressed his conviction that taking a broadview, the strategical situation would develop tcour advantage.     The value which we might obtain from establishing bases in Norway would outweigh the corresponding advantages which might be gained by the Germans.     If we could capture Narvik and establish adequate refuelling bases, we couldoffset the effects of the extended facilities forair warfare which the Germans would enjoy throughthe possession of Southern Norway.     The First Lordalso emphasised the importance of steps being takento prevent Narvik from being reinforced.     Asregards Bergen and Trondhjem, our policy should beto seal up those ports and to deal with the german naval forces now in those ports one by one,THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF emphasised thegreat advantage which it would be to us toestablish a naval base on the Norwegian Coast assoon as possible, in order to enable us to roundup the German Cruisers which would remain a seriousthreat so long as they were at large,THE PRIME MINISTER said that i t would b every necessary to ensure that we should be in aposition to defend ourselves as soon as we landed at Narvik against the strong counter-attack which wemust expect that the Germans would immediatelylaunch.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR reportedthat all preparations were being made as quickly aspossible to prepare an expedition for the capture of narvik.

iSIIn answer to the Prime Minister, the CHIEFOF THE AIR STAFF said that the Chiefs of Staff wesegiving consideration to the general situation, andwould submit a report.The following points emerged from the ensuingdiscussion(a) In the past, the importance of Narvik hadrested entirely on the fact that it wasthe gateway to the Galivare orefields.   Now,however, it assumed added importance as a basewhich we must seize and deny to the Germans.(b) If we could gain possession of Narvik, itmight still prove possible to press on towardsGalivare, or, at any rate, to take effective action against Lulea from the air.The possible imminence of a German offensive in the West should not be allowed to interferewith our expedition to Narvik, which should takeplace at all costs, as soon as it could be madeready.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR suggested thepossibility of sending submarines into theNorwegian fjords to attack German warships.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that orders tothis effect had been issued in the case ofOslo, christians and and Stavanger.   We had 19submarines in the area, and most of th^sewere working in the Kattegat and Skagei-rak, whereit was considered that they could operate tothe best advantage.(e) THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that, inaddition to the 100,000 tons of Norwegianoil which had already fallen into the handsof the Germans, there were another 200,000 tons,of which one half was distributed betweenStavanger, Bergen and Trondhjem, and the otherhalf was in the north.   He saw no prospect ofrecovering this oil ourselves, but suggestedthat air action might be taken to destroy it.(f) In reply to a question, the CHIEF OF THE AIRSTAFF said that it had been originally proposed to carry out the laying of magnetic mines from the air in Baltic and North SeaPorts during the April moon.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said he would much prefer now to use these mines to infectthe Sound and the Belts, which would be inconstant use by the &quot;Germans.   We were nolonger hampered by any considerations of danish neutrality.(c)(d)

InThe War Gabineti-(l) Expressed general agreement with theviews expressed, and, in particular, agreedthat our first aim should be the capture of Narvik.(2) Took note that the First Lord of theAdmiralty hoped to be able to put upa proposal in outline very shortly.Richmond Terrace, S..W..1
