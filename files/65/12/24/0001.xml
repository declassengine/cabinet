(40) 92nd CONCLUSIONS.  MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(.14th Aoril,    1940).THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said thatthe Naval and Military Commanders for Operation&apos;Rupert&apos; would arrive in the Narvik area during thecourse of that day.    No news had yet been received of the strength or location of the German militaryforces at Narvik, &quot;but it seemed that the landing ofthe initial contingent might possibly be made in thetown itself.    An unconfirmed report had been received that the German forces were in retreat and were beingrounded up by Norwegians.The altered situation at Narvik permitteda more hopeful viewto be taken with regard too operations in the Trondhjem area    (Operation tMauricet).He had had a telephone conversation with M. Reynaud,who was prepared to give us a free hand in theemployment of the division of Chasseurs Alpins.The Naval Staff had suggested that it might bepossible to effect a landing at Trondhjem itself.It was-anticipated that we should be able tosilence the shore batteries.      The Service Staffs werestudying all the implications of a direct landingby part of the force at Namsos in the first instance.In any event, a force of some 300 seamen and marineswere to be landed from the cruisers GLASGOW andSHEFFIELD   later that day (Operation &apos;Henry&apos;).In   addition,    there   would   be   a landing   of

600 marines and seamen at dawn on 16th April at Aalesund(Operation &apos;Primrose&apos;).      These landings would tend to attract the Germans away from Trondhjem itself, and lead totheir dispersal.      It appeared probable that the followingforces would be available for operations in the Trondhjemarea:    the second brigade of force &quot;Rupert&apos;;    the chasseurs Alpins Division, with possibly further reinforce-ments from Prance later;  and force !Maurice* - a total &quot;forceof approximately 23,000 men.     There were indications thatthe Germans had only some 3,500 men at Trondhjem, and itwas reported that a part of this force had already beendetached from the main body to proceed in the direction ofNamsos.     Taking all these factors into consideration, an operation to land at Tiondhjem did not appear to involveunjustifiable risks, particularly if, as seemed possible,the railway to TicndhLJem was still in Norwegian hands.      Itwas, of course, of the greatest importance that the RoyalAir Force should continue to harass Stavanger to themaximum extent.The Military Co-ordination Gommittee had sat twiceon Saturday evening to consider the position:    and was meeting again that afternoon to decide what steps shouldbe taken to direct forces to Namsos.THE PRIME MINISTER emphasised the importance ofobtaining early information about the railway.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY gave the WarCabinet details of certain naval action which was being studied in connection with Stavanger Aerodrome.     He said the Naval Staff regarded it as of the utmost importanceto our naval operations that the Germans should be prevented from making effective use of this aerodrome.

Question of publicity tooe given tomilitaryoperations.THE SECRETARY--OP-STATE-SORJIQREIGN AFFAIRS-  ...said that from the pd.:.tical point of view it was ofgreat importance that we should announce any information which might safely he made public regarding landingswhich our forces might make at points on theNorwegian coast.    He realised that it would be for theGeneral and Naval Staffs to decide what information could be released, but he hoped that full weight wouldbe given to the value of such announcements instiffening Norwegian resistance.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed;there was no harm in making public what we were certain was already in the possession of the Germans;but there were the greatest objections to publishinganything which they did not know or which they mightnot know.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that in the case of any given operation no announcement whatever should be made until the main body of troops had been landed since to do so would expose the troops to air attack while landing,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he would be quite content to leave thismatter to the Military Co-ordination Committee, onthe understanding that the latter would authorise the rapid publication of all information which mightsafely be disclosed0The War Cabinet took note of theabove discussion.

(40) 90thConclusions,Minute 2.)W.M.   (40) 92nd CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex.(14th April, 1940.)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs drew attention to Telegrams Nos. 116 and 119 DIPPfrom Paris giving the French Government&apos;s reply to our proposals for the immediate initiation of bombing attacks against military objectives in Germany in theevent of a German invasion of Belgium or Holland.The French Government&apos;s reply was unsatisfactory inthat, although it recognised the need for immediate action in such a contingency, it made Frenchagreement subject to reservations.It was generally agreed that considerable pressure would probably have to be brought to bearon the French Government to induce them to change their hesitating attitude, the deciding factorprobably being M. Daladier.     At the same time,  therewere various indications - such as the recent Germanbroadcast of an untrue statement that British aircraft had bombed a railway station in Schleswig-Holstein -that the enemy might be working up for initiatingunlimited air warfare.     This made it all the more necessary to have our plans completely cut and driedbeforehand.     The British and French Staffs should therefore enter into immediate discussions, on thelines proposed in the reply of the French Government,in order to arrive at an agreed plan, on theassumption that the French would agree to this

being carried out immediately the German attackdeveloped.The War Cabinet:-Invited the Secretary of State forAir to instruct the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, British AirForces in France,  to place himself in immediate communication with theFre&quot;ach High Command, with a view toconcerting an agreed plan for theopening phase of air operations in theevent of a German invasion of holland or Belgium.The Jtfar Cabinet also had before them aMemorandum by the Military Co-ordination Committeerelating to the arrangements for the intervention of the metropolitan heavy bomber force in the land battle in the event of a German attack on theWestern Front (l?.P. (40) 128),THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that,since this question had been discussed in theautumn,  the emphasis had shifted somewhat fromattacks on objectives far back in Germany toattacks closer up to the actual area of the land battle.      The chief point in the paper underconsideration, however, was  the machineryfor controlling the allocation of the heavy bomber force.      This force was the equivalent of the battlefleet at sea, and any decision to employ it in itsentirety in any particular operation would be amatter of the greatest moment.     Nevertheless, itwas essential that very rapid decisions could betaken on this matter.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR explainedthat, under the Committee&apos;s recommendation, thegeneral policy would, as heretofore, continue to be

laid down &quot;by the War Cabinet itaelf within the limits of their policy,,    The Chief of the Air Staff and himself would take decisions on minor operationssuch as were being carried out every day at thepresent time.     There would, however, be borderlinecases in which the forces to be employed would be larger^  and a conflict of requirements might arise.It was to deal with these cases that the machineryrecommended in paragraph 3 of the Memorandum was tobe used, namely -&quot;The Secretary of State for Air and theChairman of the Military Co-ordinationCo:.mittee in consultation,  should heempowered to decide what proportion ofthe metropolitan heavy bomber force should from time to time be allocated to meet the requirements of the french high Command, who will be responsiblefor the conduct of the land battle.In the event of a disagreement,  thematter would have to be referred to theWar Cabinet.&quot;If it was intended to take some actionwhich went beyond the general policy laid down bythe War Cabinet,   and if it was intended to use the.whole bomber force for some operation which mightbe decisive;  one way or the other, the decisions would,  of cours-e, have to be taken by the WarCabinet as a whole.The War Cabinet;-Approved the recommendations ofthe Military Co-co-ordination committee, as set out in W. P.(40)128and as amplified in discussion.Terrace, S.f7.1.
