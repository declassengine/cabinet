MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(14th March, 1940).SCANDINAVIA.(PreviousReferenceW.M.(40) 67thConclusions,Minute 6).Effect of theRuss ian-F inni shTreaty on our naval Situation.The War Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty on the Effect ofthe Russian-Finnish Treaty on our Naval Situation(W.P.(40) 96).THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY apologisedfor circulating his paper at such short notice, but thematter was of the greatest urgency, since a decisionhad to be taken almost immediately whether the wholeScandinavian expedition should be dispersed or whether we should allow the troop movements which were already in progress to continue.     The concessions extortedfrom Finland, which allowed free access to Russiathrough Finland into Norway and Sweden, were in effectan act of potential aggression against us, and raisedan altogether new situation.     It was for consideration whether we should not give Norway and Sweden means ofreinforcing their neutrality.     We might go on withour plans to secure possession of Narvik for thispurpose.     Our real objective was, of course, to securepossession of the Galivare ore fields, which wouldcertainly shorten the war and save great bloodshedlater on.     Up till now we had had assistance to finland as &quot;cover&quot; fotf such a move on our part, but wehad now lost this Justification for intervention in

IllScandinavia.     The only chance seemed to be to takethe line that our national interests were directlythreatened by the possibility of Russia making her way through Scandinavia to the Atlantic.     A decision to seize Narvik by force was a very unpleasant one totake, but it had to be balanced against the much worseprospect of very costly fighting on the Western Frontlater on.     We were fighting at a grave disadvantage in that we felt ourselves bound at present always tofind some moral justification for every action we took,however pressing might be the military need for suchaction.     Our enemy, on the other hand, was nothampered   in any way by such considerations.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he ha*d been .approached by the Minister for Co-ordination of defence on the previous evening for instructions as to what should be done about.the preparations for the expedition.       There had been three possible courses: -(i)   ^o go ahead with all arrangements,(ii)   A &quot;stand still&quot; order,(iii)   To abandon the operation altogether.He had ruled out the first course and given instructions for a &quot;stand still&quot; order, with a view to taking a final decision the following day.     He hadin mind that there was a possibility of the peace treaty not being ratified by Finland, or even of a coup d&apos;e*tat which would turn out the present finnish government.    It now seemed almost certain that thepeace terms would in fact be ratified.     The firstLord&apos;s proposal, however,.raised quite a new issue.His   own view was that, if our principal object was to

secure possession of the Galivare ore fields, thedespatch of the expedition to Narvik would serve no useful purposeo     The Swedes would certainly have no hesitation in opposing us and sabotaging their railwaysif we tried to force our way in, now that the justification of assisting Finland no longer remained.If we took such action, we should completely alienatethe sympathies of Norway and Sweden at the very moment when they were feeling a sense of relief from thedanger of being involved in hostilities.     A betterway of achieving our object seemed to be to makecapital out of this feeling of relief in the scandinavian countries, and to point out to them the i.T.heren&apos;i dangers of the peace terms.   We might sugg*that they sb^uld consider with us what could be done to give them security against this potential dangerof Russian aggression.     Such a policy seemed to givemuch more hope of establishing better relations withthe Scandinavian countries, and therefore of ultimatelyreducing Swedish exports of ore to Germany, than would be the use of force at Narvik.     The presentmoment might indeed be a good one to send a mission,headed by a member of the War Cabinet, to Norway and sweden,     These countries might be in a very receptivemood now, and if we succeeded in improving ourrelations with them, it was quite possible later onthat they might even ask for our support.

bill the MINISTER -WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said, thatsuggestions had appeared in the Press that aScandinavian alliance might he formed, and he thought we might take advantage of the present situation toenter into discussions with a view to underwritingthe alliance.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that Norway and Sweden might he rather shy ofsuch a suggestion., He was against the First Lord&apos;proposal, mainly oia the grounds that he did notthink it would achieve the purpose for which it was designed, namely, to obtain possession of the Galivareorefields.     Now that the excuse of going to the aid of Finland was removed, the Norwegians and Swedeswould oppose more than ever any attempt on our part to penetrate their countries, and we should certainly have to fight our way through.   The only effect ofsuch action would he to drive the Norwegians andSwedes into the arms of the Germans.    He would notdeny that the Germans, for geographical reasons, were well placed to dominate Swedenj   hut they could onlysecure their full requirements from that countryeither by an invasion, or by the exercise of pressure.     Germany obviously did not want to invadeSweden, and therefore her pressure would stop short of war.     If we could increase our influence in8weden, and gain her goodwill, we should be able todo much to counteract this German pressure, and tokeep down the supply of ore.He thought that the First Lord of theAdmiralty placed too gloomy a construction on

Clauses 6 and 7 of the Russo-Finnish Treaty.They appeared to legislate merely for the improve-ment of facilities for normal trade in NorthernFinland..   The Russians mighty of course, interpret the Treaty in a sinister fashion;   hut they couldonly get to Narvik by going through Sweden, andwe would have time, when the threat became imminent,to forestall them.    Our policy, therefore, shouldbe to try and strengthen our relations with the norwegians and the Swedes, and to lead up graduallyto the concerting of joint measures for guardingScandinavia from the Russian menace.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thatno particular importance could be attached to theterms of the Treaty, as the present settlement wasdoubtless only a stage in the development ofRussian plans.    Nevertheless, it would be difficultto take the step proposed by the First Lord, in viewof the fact that the House of Commons had just been assured that our intervention in Scandinavia couldonly take place as a result of an appeal by the finns.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thatthe French had made the same statement.    Hesuggested that, if the First Lord was concerned atthe possibility of Russian expansion to the Atlanticcoast, the right course would be to have the mattertechnically examined, so as to see what the russians would be capable of doing, and how they could be prevented.THE CH33IF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff pointed out that the Russians could only advancefrom Petsamo to the Atlantic coast of Norway bygoing through Tornio.- 5 -

bill the MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO thoughtthat the argument underlying the First lord proposal should carry considerable weight in discussions with the Norwegians and Swedes, as affecting the long term policies of those countries.We could point out to them that, when the russians had constructed their railway across NorthernFinland, they would be faced with the possibilityof Russian aggression, and would do well to concertmeasures with us for meeting it.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought it was mostimportant that the Foreign Office should examinehow best to take advantage of the present feelings of relief of the Norwegians and Swedes*    Therewere a number of outstanding matters for discussion,such as the supply of tankers, and our relationsmight be improved by careful handling.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thoughtthat we might be taking too optimistic a view ofthe attitude of Norway and Sweden.    He thought hat they might very probably be more impressed with the might of Germany and Russia than withthe wish to cultivate good relations with us,

mTHE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said that he had felt it right to draw the attention of the War Cabinet,to one method of continuing their action in Scandinaviawhile there was yet time.   The Naval Staff certainlywere concerned at the danger which might eventuallyarise from Russian expansion in the North, but this long-range danger would certainly not justify taking such a drastic step as the invasion of a neutral country.   It was only the hope of securing the iron ore,and of thus shortening &quot;the length of the war, and perhaps of obviating the slaughter which would other-wise inevitably ensue on the Western Front, whichwould justify that course.   He feared we should neverget another opportunity of gaining a footing in scandinavia.Some discussion ensued as to how long it would benecessary to keep the expedition standing.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat the present arrangements could be held for a fewdays, during which a decision could be token.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it would only benecessary to maintain the standstill arrangement until it was certain that no reversal of Finnish policy wasto be expected - which he thought would only be amatter of a few hours.The War cabinet-(l) Decided that, so soon as the foreign secretary was satisfied that the finnish government&apos;s policy of making peace withRussia would not be reversed, steps shouldhe taken to disperse the forces preparedfor the Scandinavian expedition:(S) Invited the Foreign Secretary-y to informthe Minister for Co-ordination of defence in regard to (l) above, in order that thelatter might issue instructions to theDepartments concerned.richmond Terrace, S.:7.1, . . .14th March, 1940.
