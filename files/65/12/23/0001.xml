THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.COPY NO.   11W.M.   (40) 91st CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex..Q.5th April, 1940) .OPERATIONS in norway.(previous reference;W.M.(40) 90thConclusions,Minute 3.)THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY suggestedthat we should effect landings at several points onthe Norwegian coast in order to confuse the Germansas to our intentions. There were, no doubt, many points at which parties of several hundred men couldbe landed. Our object must be to obtain command ofthe coast at the earliest possible moment.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that the most important point was to secureTrondhjem and the railways leading from that portacross the peninsula.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff pointed out that this might well prove to be abig operation which would require additional troops.Such troops could only be obtained by withdrawal from france.THE PRIME MINISTER invited attention to atelegram from the French Mission in Sweden emphasising the essential importance of Trondhjem (Telegram 213from Stockholm).    He was impressed with the urgency of obtaining a firm foothold at Trondhjem,particularly from the political point of view.    If atthe moment   we merely concentrated on Narvik, therewas a danger lest the Norwegians and Swedes would feelthat our only interest was the iron ore.    In that event,they might become disheartened and give up the struggle..

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed that early action against Trondhjem wasimperative from the political point of view, whileit seemed that,  if necessary, the operation at narvik could wait.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that theFrench Division of Chasseurs Alpins   might be moreusefully employed in operations at Trondhjem thanat Narvik, and that the French should be pressed to give us a free hand as regards theemployment of these troops.The War Cabinet were informed that the chasseurs Alpins   were now in process of embarkationat Brest and that the earliest date at which theycould arrive at Narvik was 21st April.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY urged thatno alteration should be made in the present plans forthe capture of Narvik, which were, in fact, already in process of being carried out.    He suggested that,before approaching the French, we should await theresult of the Naval operations at Narvik, which hadbeen arranged to take place that day.    $hen theresults of these were known, the general situation would be much clearer, and there would still be plenty of time to discuss a modification of plans with theFrench.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR thought that,in view of the telegram from the French Mission in stockholm, we should at once ask the French to give us a free hand with the division of Chasseurs Alpins-vTHE PRIME MINISTER appreciated the importanceof the Narvik project.   At the same time, he wasprofoundly impressed with the arguments in favour ofsecuring Trondhjem.   He quoted the following extractfrom the Foreign Office Telegram No. 208 DIPP from-2-

Stockholm, recording the views of the members of theAllied Mission,  and the French and British Ministers;. -&quot; We realise that Trondhjem stands high in theorder of Allied objectives but we wish toemphasise most strongly that on both miliaryand political grounds it should stand first,and that time is of paramount importance.&quot;In these circumstances he thought that we should obtain permission forthwith from the French to exercise ourdiscretion as to where the Chasseurs Alpine   should besent,  so that if necessary they could be diverted en route from Narvik to Namsos.    He did not suggest that thisdiversion should be ordered now, but merely that the french should give us the necessary discretion to make it ifevents showed that it was desirable.   As regards therespective merits of Trondhjem and Narvik, we might say we reply to the telegram from Stockholm quoted above thatTrondhjem did,  in fact, stand first in our opinion In theorder of Allied objectives, but that for military reasonswe considered that it would first be necessary to establishourselves at Narvik.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY was veryapprehensive of any proposals which might tend to weaken our intention to seize Narvik,    Nothing must be allowed todeflect us from making the capture of this place ascertain as possible.    Our plans against Narvik had beenvery carefully laid, and there seemed every chance thatthey would be successful if they were allowed to proceed without being tampered with.    Trondhjem was, on the otherhand, a much more speculative affair,   and he deprecatedany suggestion which might lead to the diversion of the chasseurs Alpins until we had definitely establishedourselves at Narvik.    Otherwise,  there was a grave danger that we should find ourselves committed to a number ofineffectual operations along the Norwegian coast, none ofwhich would succeed.

At the same time the War Cabinet would wishto know that careful consideration had already beengiven to the question of effecting landings in theTrondhjem area, and that plans were already being made.These included a small landing of Naval forces namsos, which was due to take place that afternoon.Furthermore, the Chief of the Imperial General staff had collected a force of five Battalions, two of whichwould be ready to land on the Norwegian coast on the16th April, and three more on the 21st April.      Theactual points at which landings were to be made wouldbe decided that night.Furthermore, the orders given to GeneralMackesey, who was in charge of the Narvik operation,had been changed.      The original orders had been that,after landing, he should push rapidly on to   Galivare.He had now been instructed to go no further than theSwedish frontier, since, if Sweden was friendly, weshould have no need to be apprehensive about theorefields, and, if hostile, the difficulty or pushingon would be too great.      The effect of these changedorders, in relation to Trondhjem, would be that GeneralMackesey   would be free to address his mind to thepossibility of carrying out further operations to thesouth once he had consolidated his position at Narvik.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSappreciated the military argument in favour of adhering to the plans which we had made for Narvik, and the facttkat there would be time in which to divert the chasseurs Alpins, if necessary.     On the other hand,there was a very important political factor which must

&quot;be taken, into account, namely, that unless we could give the Norwegians and Swedes some assurances of the help which we intended to send them, there was aserious risk that they would collapse.       Would it therefore not be possible to tell them what we hadin mind about both Narvik   and the Trondhjem area?THE LORD PRIVY SEAL considered that the viewsof the French members of the Mission to Sweden con-tained in Foreign Office Telegram No.  213 from Stockholm,must have a profound effect in modifying the attitude of the French Government regarding the diversion of the Chasseurs Alpins.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR agreed,  and suggested that we should base our enquiry to the Frenchon this telegram.     We might say   that, in the eventof our initial operations at Narvik   proving more successful than we had expected, we should not requireso many troops to follow them up, and ask for liberty of action to divert the Chasseurs Alpins to the Trondhjemarea if necessary.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER suggestedthat the proposal should be regarded, not as a changein our strategic plans, but rather as a measure tohearten the Norwegians and Swedes who were disposed to wilt because they thought that we were onlyinterested in Narvik.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR consideredthat it was most important that we should correct theimpression that our intention to seize Narvik wasinspired by the selfish motive that it was the entrance to the ore fields.      Itshould be made clear to the

Norwegians and Swedes that the value of Narvik to uslay in the fact that it would give us the naval baseon the Norwegian coast which was essential to theconduct of operations elsewhere.      The capture of narvik was therefore an essential pre-requisite too operations in the Trondhjem area.Quoting a War Office report that German forces were said to he advancing on Namsos, he said that itwas most important that we should press on with ouasplans for the occupation of the Trondhjem area, andthat as a first step we should inform the Norwegiansof our intentions in this respect, in order to putheart into them..THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFconsidered that our chances of securing Narvik were good, provided that we were right in our estimate that German forces did not number more than 4,000.He believed that he had the permission of general gamelin; to use the Chasseurs Alpins elsewhere than at narvik !if necessary, but he favoured having thisIconfirmed by the French Government.     Meanwhile, he considered that our plans for landing on the norwegian coast were sufficiently elastic to permit of diversionwithout impairing them.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that itmight be necessary to proceed to invest the german forces in Narvik.     But we should not allow theoperation to degenerate into an investment exceptafter a very determined battle.     On this understandinghe would be prepared to send a telegram to the Frenchsaying that we hoped and thought that we should be

Relation ofNorwegianOperations to western Front.successful in seizing Narvik &quot;by a coup-de-main.     Weshould explain that our operation had been faciliated by a change in the orders which did not now require the expedition to go beyond the Swedish frontier, for thereasons which we should state.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thatwe must anticipate that reinforcements might berequired from France to send to Norway.    He suggestedthat we should get into touch with the French on thisquestion at a very early date.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY felt thatit would be premature to make an approach to the Frenchat this stage.After further discussion it was decided thatthis question might be deferred for a day or twoThe War Cabinet agreed:-That communications should besent as follows in the light ofthe above discussion.(a) To the Swedish Government, in replyto Mr. Mallet&apos;s telegram No.  S08.We should say that we intended torecapture both Trondhjem and Narvik;that we recognised the supreme importance of Trondhjem as a focalcentre;    but that it was important to secure Narvik as a naval base.It might be added that we had no intention that our forces should proceed over the Swedish frontier.(b) To the Norwegian Government on thesame lines as to the swedish government.(c) To the French Government0.(i) Inviting them to give us liberty to use the Chasseurs Alpins for operations elsewhere than at narvik,     and(ii) Informing them of the communi eat ionswhich were being sent to theSwedish and Norwegian Governments.

The First Lord of the Admiralty was invited to prepare a draft relatingto the employment of the ChasseursAlpins, and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to prepare theremaining drafts, which would be shown,to the Prime Minister before despatch.Richmond Terrace, S^W.1.
