COPY HO.8W.M. (40) 61st CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(6th March, 1940.)assistance THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN A.7FAIRSFINLAND.said that since the last meeting of the War Cabinet twoireviousIferences       telegrams (Nos. 174 and 175, dated 4th and 5th March,M.(40)60thInclusions,   1940) had been received from His Majesty&apos;s Minister,smite 6.)Helsinki, containing messages from Brigadier Ling and colonel King Salter supporting the Finnish appeal for thedespatch of bombers.    No communication had, however, beenreceived from the Finnish Government.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he interpretedthis delay as indicating that we should probably not receive from the Finnish Government the appeal we hadbeen waiting for.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY mentioned thatthe French Naval Liaison Officer in London had informed the First Sea Lord that the French Government weredespatching a number of aircraft to Finland, togetherwith 300 tons of stores and 100 personnel, and had asked that we should facilitate the transit of these to scandinavia.THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the line which we were now taking with the finnish government, namely that we could not decide to sendadditional material until v/e knew whether Finland would issue

an appeal for Allied assistance in the manner proposedin the Allied plan, might have a result different fromthat v/e anticipated; for the Finns might decide togive ia on the ground that they did not ,mow the extent on which they could rely on us for the supply ofmaterialoTHE PRIME MINISTER considered that such an attitude would be wholly unjustified in view of thefact that we had offered to send an Expedition totheir assistance.THE SECRETARY OF STuTjS FOR WAR said that theamount of material which we might send depended on whether there was an Expedition or not,  since  in..thelatter event we should he able to spare a largerquantity,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that oven if therewas no Expedition wo ought to continue to send volunteers and to help with material.THE PRIME MINI lTi2l said that the finnish government were perfectly free to take what action they thought best $ they could cither  a sic us to send an expedition or, if they did not desire this, they couldask us to send heavy bombersguns and other materialsOn the other hand, if they wished,  they could make thebest terms obtainable with the U.S.,S-.R.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSenquired whether if, after weighing the risks on theWestern Front and elsewhere, we were to decide to send to finland, say, 50 modern bomberss  it would be possible forus, having regard to the amount of ground equipment and personnel at our disposal, without thereby suffering an undue xoss of efficiency, to bring back those bombers,if we ourselves were attacked.

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that thedetachment of 50 &quot;bombers would involve withdrawal from our central reserves of large quantities of spares, equipment,- etc      In reply to the foreign secretary&apos;s question he did not believe that in thecircumstances Indicated we should be likely to get back more than 10 out of the 50 bombers.In reply to a question by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty, the Chief of the Air Staff gave particulars of our total bombing strength.     He had had a long talk the previous day with Brigadier Ling;while he felt        utmost sympathy with the Finns intheir present distress, he could not see any military,as opposed to psychological, justification for thedespatch of additional bombers to Finland.     Thedespatch of IS or even 24 bombers might lengthenFinnish resistance but could have no decisive effect&apos;on the issue,THE PRIME MINISTER said that j t would be useful if the Chiefs of Staffs Committee would discuss with Brigadier Ling the military value of the despatch to Finland of equipment of various kinds.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he bad had a conversation the previous day with M. Corbin, the French Ambassador, who had handedhim a Note setting out the French Government&apos;s view,which was that we should not allow ourselves to bebaulked in our plans by the Scandinavian Governments;and that, if we acted with fineness now, all would bewell.       In reply to a question as to our attitude, he

had informed M. Gorhin that we were in full agreementwith the feelings of the French Government hut thatwe considered it necessary to take into account alsoother considerations the nature of which he had thenexplained.     A full record of the interview would hecirculated to the War Cabinet.In reply to a question by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, the Foreign Secretary saidthat he had so far communicated with the FrenchGovernment on this matter through Sir Ronald Campbell,but that he would consider also the despatch of a personal message from himself to M. Daladier.The War Cabinets-(a) Took note of the above discussion;(b) Agreed that the Chiefs of StaffsCommittee should be invited todiscuss with Brigadier Ling themilitary value of the despatch to Finland of equipment of various kinds.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.

(40) 61st CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex.(6th March, 1940.)ioyal marine operation.deviouslet erence:f.M. (39) 110thconclusions,minute 3.)THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that,in putting forward his Note (W.P. (40) 84) he had notattempted to argue the moral or juridical aspects ofthe proposed operation, hut had confined himself tothe present state of progress, and the points onwhich decision was required,,He had received a telegram from the Admiralwho was in charge of the operation in France, sayingthat the conditions were now perfect, hut might not he so good if we waited until after a thaw began inthe mountains.     The War Cabinet would observe thatthe Royal Air Force would not be ready to begin ona large scale until the middle of April, though   theymight be able to do a certain amount during the Marchmoon.     He saw no objection, however, to starting thenaval part of the operation as soon as it was ready.The object was not to create a sudden surprise on alarge scale, but permanently to arrest the traffic onthe Rhine.     What was most important, therefore, was tobe able to maintain the effort once it had been begun.&apos;.In any case, surprise would to some extent be lost bythe necessity for giving a certain degree of notice,so as to enable neutrals and civilians to get clearof the danger area.

,    THE FIFTH SEA LORD said that the mines wouldhe- introduced into a tributary of the Rhineapproxaimately on a level with Karlsruhe, and were estimated to reach Mainz in 34 hours.    They might,of course, go much further down, as they were self-destroying only at the end of five days.The traffic between Mainz; and Karlsruhewas known to be almost entirely military.   A recent report also showed that there was very heavy traffic between Mainz and Mannheim,   He thought it would bevery difficult for the Germans to contrive effectivecounter measures which would not have the effect of stopping the traffic.   The mines would be introduced in large numbers, and would travel about three feetbelow the surface.    They would destroy any wire ornet placed across the stream.   The Royal Air force would carry out their part of the operation inlonely reaches of the river, where there would be noanti-aircraft defences.There was a floating boom across the rivernear KarlsruheP where  the Rhine- entered territory which was German on both banks.   It was. hoped thatthe first lot of mines would destroy this boom,and open the passage for the others.       There were several alternative places at which the mines couldbe placed in the tributaries of the Rhine,   andthe operation of &quot;streaming in&quot; would be carried out at night,, or in fog.

-     56THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he saw no objection to the proposed operation,provided the notice given would he sufficient to enableneutral barges to withdraw from the- part of the riveraffected.    The Foreign Office Legal Advisers were of the opinion that the traffic on the Rhine constituted a military objective, which -src should be justified inattaching.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR and THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought that the operation should be carried out as a measure of retaliation, andthat the notice given should include publication of thedeclaration recently considered by the War Cabinet inconnection with action in Norwegian territorial waters,subject possibly to some amendment.    The justification for our case would therefore not rest on the type ofobjective attacked, but on the German methods of warfareat sea0THE FIRST 33a LORD said that the Naval attache in Paris reported that Admiral Darlan, with whom thematter had been fully discussed, was enthusiasticallyin favour of the operation, which he thought might havea decisive effect upon the war in, say, a year&apos;s time.THE MINISTER.FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEemphasised the importance of linking the operation withthe German attack on trade in our home waters.    Inthis way, a split might be caused between the militaryand the naval authorities in Germany.    The former,who would be perturbed by the cessation ofmilitary traffic on the Rhine, might well bring pressure to bear on the naval authorities to stop theirunrestricted sea warfare.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL urged the importanceof not starting the operation before we were ready-to carry it out on a sufficiently large scale.It might have very big results, but there had been:naay    cases in the past of new weapons being used, and their secret given away, before theywere available in large quantities.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatthere were a number of aspects of the problem which required to be fully investigated - for example,the period of notice to be given, the correcttiming of the start, the effect of possiblereprisals, and so on.     It was for this reason that he had suggested, in the last paragraph ofhis Note, that the Chiefs of Staff should review the operation, and advise the War Cabinet on thedetails - all preparations mo.&apos;.::1.while going forward.When this report had been made, he thought itwould be necessary to put the matter officially tothe French Government, to get their concurrencewith what we proposed to do, as any reprisal mightpartly fall on them.     He thought the French shouldalso associate themselves with our declaration.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said thatit would be necessary to consider, at a later stage, the extension of operations to the Danube,,The present conditions of ice and flood water wouldmake it impossible to attempt operations there forsome time to come, but he would put forward his proposals on the subject for detailed examination by the Chiefs of Staff.

IfThe War Cabinet:-(i) Gave general approval to the carryingout of operations of the typedescribed in the Note by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (W.P.(40) 84),as a measure of retaliation for german methods of sea warfare, subjectto the points dealt with in (ii) and(iv) below.(ii) Requested the Chiefs of Staff Committeeto review the proposed operation and to report to the War Cabinet,with particular reference to thefollowing aspects(a) How much notice should be given before the operations begin,so that neutral traffic can gaina place of safety.(b) The timing of the various phasesof the operations, havingregard to the importance of avoiding the premature disclosure of a new, and possibly decisive,weapon.(c) Possible enemy reprisals.(iii) Agreed that, pending the outcome ofthe Chiefs of Staff1s investigation,preparations should proceed for thebeginning of the naval operation on or after 12th March.(iv) Took note that, when the Report ofthe Chiefs of Staff had been received,and had been considered by the WarCabinet, the next step would probablybe for the Foreign Secretary toobtain the formal concurrence of theFrench Government to the operation,and their agreement to *&apos;he issue ofa joint declaration by the Frenchand British Governments.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
