THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that(Previous the Naval Staff had requested the Air Ministry to reference:W.M.(40) 99th     arrange for the laying of magnetic mines in the KielConclusions,Minute 2.) Canal.     He was personally in favour of this operationProposed mine-     being carried out, but he pointed out that there waslayingoperations. some risk that some of the mines might be dropped onthe banks of the Canal, their secrecy thereby beingcompromi sed.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSsaw no objection to the proposed operation, from thepolitical point of view, and he did not think that itwas necessary to give public notification that we were about to do it.     Both ends of the Kiel Canal weremined, and therefore any neutral ship in the Canalmust already have decided to risk the passage throughtwo mine-fields.     He had discussed the matter with theLegal Adviser to the Foreign Office, who thought thatthere was a good case for not giving publicnotification.THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF understoodthat the Coastal Command were confident of being ableto drop the mines accurately.      The mines were notfitted with parachutes and would be dropped from a very

low height..   He understood that no mines would he dropped in any case where there was a danger of their landing on the hanks of the Canal.    The Admiralty, however, v/ouldwish to reconsider the matter if there was any danger ofthe secrecy of the mines being compromised.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR. suggested that before deciding to carry out the operation, and Naval andAir Staffs might review the matter from this angle.The War Cabinet agreed:-(a) That, from the political point of view there was no objection to the laying ofmagnetic mines in the Kiel Canal andthat it was unnecessary to give priornotification of the operation.(b) That,before putting the operation intoeffect,  the Naval and Air Staffs should again consider whether the operation should be carried out in view of therisk that one of the mines might be dropped on the banks of the Canal andthe secrecy of the device therebycompromised.Richmond Terrace, S.W..1..

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST    SECRET.COPY NO.16W.M.(40)  100TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(22nd April, 1940.)operations in NORWAY.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 99thConclusions,Minute 4.)Namsos.The War Cabinet were informed that thesituation at Namsos was not clear, but it was evidentthat our forces were faced with a most difficult situation.      The town of Namsos and the rail-head hadbeen destroyed, and the pier damaged by air attack,although no casualties had been reported amongst either the British or French troops.      The French transportVILLE d&apos;ALGERS had arrived at Namsos on the previous night, but had been sent away without unloading.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR read to theWar Cabinet a telegram No. 2335, 21st April, fromGeneral Carton de Wiart, reporting on the difficult situation which had arisen in the Namsos area.    BrigadierPhillips&apos; brigade had been attacked by a German force which had landed from a cruiser and a torpedo-boat ontheir flank (presemably near the head of TrondhjemFjord).    The German aircraft dominated the situationand General Carton de Wiart feared that his position was becoming untenable and that he might have to evacuate his troops.     A message was being sent toGeneral Carton de Wiart pointing out the importance of keeping his troops in being, and informing him of the steps which were being taken to provide air support.An anti-aircraft cruiser was on its way to Namsos;fighters from carriers would be available on the 24thApril;    and it was hoped that Royal Air Force fighterswould be operating from a frozen lake in Norway by the25th April.     General Carton de Wiart had been asked

for a further appreciation in the light of this information. jIn reply to a question, GENERAL DILL expressedthe view that if it was found necessary to withdraw fromNamsos, it would he valueless, from the military point ofview, to attempt to land the troops at some other point inthe vicinity of Namsos in the present conditions of deepsnow.      It would he better to withdraw the forces alto-gether with a view to landing them in a different area, say,at Andalsnes, as opportunity offered.     Three battalions ofTerritorials and about 3,000 French troops had been landed at Namsos, but it seemed probable that the two forces were a number of miles apart.      The only anti-aircraft protectionwhich our forces had in this area were light automatics, buta deployed force was a poor target for bombing attack.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that he had reported the situation to the Prime Minister before thelatter&apos;s departure for France earlier in the morning.    ThePrime Minister had agreed that we would have to be guided by the men on the spot, and that no decision was called foruntil the situation was clearer.     He (the Secretary ofState for War) had also seen the Leaders of the Opposition,and had informed them that there was a possibility of a set-back at Namsos.In reply to a question, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORAIR said that all our troops had supplies for 14 days, butthe French troops landed at Namsos had lost a considerableportion of their stores and they might well be short of food and ammunition.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO referred to GeneralCarton de Wiart&apos;s statement that if it was necessary towithdraw from Namsos, the ships should not be larger than5,000 tons.       He asked whether suitable Norwegian ships could be found for this purpose.THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that theNavy were combing the Fjords for Norwegian shipping.Norwegian coasting vessels, however, did not possesssufficient endurance for the purpose in view, and it would

probably be necessary for us to use warships.    Cruiserswhich had landed troops at Andalsnes might be available..Attitude of . THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR referred to thethe Press toevents in optimistic reports which had appeared in the PressNorway.which gave the impression that the Allies were sweepingvictoriously forward after successful landings inconsiderable strength at a number of places in Norway.  &apos;Unless the Press could be persuaded to alter theirtone, the public might suffer a severe shock if thingswent badly at Namsos.THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF emphasised the dangers of mentioning the names of any place atwhich our troops were operating.    A German soldier      1who had been taken prisoner had stated that theGermans had been unaware of our landing at Namsosuntil it was mentioned in a B.B. C. broadcast,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had arranged to interview some 30 to 40 representatives of newspapers during the course of the afternoon.    he asked for guidance as to the line which he should take.In the ensuing discussion, there wasunanimous agreement that no mention whatever should bemade of the possibility of a withdrawal of our troops from Namsos.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that a fairly broad line should be taken with the Press, who should be warned of the dangers ofover optimistic reports of operations which were bothhazardous and difficult.    It should be pointed out tothem that we had made a number of landings from someof which we would thrust forward in strength, while others were less important.    No doubt there would beminor setbacks in certain localities but these would not

deter us from our main purpose.    At the same time theeffect of our communiques on Mussolini and on the morale of the neutrals must not he lost sight of.There was general agreement with theseviev/s.After some further discussion THE CHANCELLOROP THE EXCHEQUER summed up the points which might he put to the Press editors as follows:-(l)    No hint should he given of the possibilityof a withdrawal from Namsos.(2)   We had landed at a number of points on thecoast and it was undesirable that too much attention should be paid by the Press toany one of them, particularly to Namsos,(3)   The operations which we were undertakingwere by no means easy and we would probably have to face minor setbacks in somelocalities.    At the same time these would notdeter us from our main purpose.    Our generalprogress gave cause for satisfaction.(4)    Our troops had made contact with theNorwegian forces and this had had a mostheartening effect on the Norwegian army.(5)    In these particular operations, Germany wasrelying far more than usual on foreign Pressandbroadcasts to obtain vital information.    Itwas therefore imperative for the success ofthe operations and the safety of our menthat names of places from which our troops:were operating should not be mentioned by thePress or by the B.B.C.    A case had already occurred in which there were strong reasons to   fear that a statement published in thiscountry had been of the greatest value to theGermans.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS,  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR AND THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR undertook to providethe Lord Privy Seal with any items of news whichwould he of assistance to him at his meeting that afternoon.The War Cabinet -Invited the Lord Privy seal to take the line indicated inthe points summarized above(side-line A) in his forthcominginterview with the newspapereditors.Bombardment THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF saidof Narvik.that two telegrams had been received from theFlag Officer in Command regarding forthcomingoperations against Narvik.      These telegrams couldbe summarised as follows:-In the first telegram the Flag officer in Command said that it was his present intention to carry out an operation in the nature of a reconnaissancein force on the 23rd April, or thefirst favourable occasion thereafter,by the ships under his command.      troops would be concealed below, ready to exploit any opportunity presented asthe result of naval bombardment.    TheGermans might be ready to capitulateimmediately, but would stiffen if given time.    It was not his intention toattempt an opposed landing.;     climate conditions were against it.    Should this effort fail, harassing operations would continue and a second bombardmentwould be carried out at a later date.After consulting the General, he would&apos;report what reinforcements were required later, if direct attack hadto be carried through.

The second telegram contained the text of a message from General Mackesy.     The latterstated that before the proposed action againstNarvik began, he felt it his duty to representthat there was no Officer or man under his command who would not feel shame for himself and his country if thousands of Norwegians, men,women and children, in Narvik were subject tothe proposed bombardment.     In forwarding this statement the Commander-in-Chief .said that hehad no remarks.The First Lord of the Admiralty had prepared a draft reply to the Flag Officer in Command asfollows:-He presumed that the Flag Officer had read the bombardment Instructions issued at the outbreakof war.     If he found it necessary to go beyond those instructions on account of the enemy using the shelter of buildings to maintain himself inNarvik, he might deem it wise to give, say, sixhours&apos; warning, by every means at his disposal,including, if possible, leaflets,  and to informthe German Commander that all civilians mustleave the town and that he would be held responsible if he obstructed their departure.He might also offer to leave the railway lineunmolested for a period of six hours, to enablecivilians to make good their escape by thatroute.In discussion the following points weremade:-(i) The Flag Officer in Command certainly did not intend ordering an indiscriminate bombardmentof the town of Narvik.   His intention was tobombard the town to such extent as might benecessary to drive the Germans out.     It was,- however, quite impossible to confine bombardmentto particular machine gun nests and other strong points which in any case would be probably invisiblefrom the sea.(ii) The result of the bombardment was likely to be known in a period of a few hours.   During thattime the civilian inhabitants could not do morethan take such shelter in the hills as theycould find.(iii) There was no doubt that unless the town were entirely cleared of civilians,  some loss of norwegian life would result from the proposedbombardment.

(iv)   Assuming that the operation was to he carriedout, the question was how to ensure that adequate notice was given to the civilian population to leave.     A suggestion was made that instead of giving six hours warning we might give twelve hours.   Alternatively, theoperation now due to he carried out on23rd April might he postponed until thefollowing day.      In reply to a question bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer, the deputy chief OF NAVAL STAFF said that, while it was difficult definitely to affirm that delay in carrying out the operation would be disastrous,  experience showed that when an operation was delayed there was almost alwayscause for regretting it.(v)   The suggestion was made that M. Colban, theNorwegian Minister, should be asked to broadcast a warning from London, but it was felt that there were strong objections tothis course,  since it would be tantamount toinforming the world that we intended to carryout an operation which would involve the lossof Norwegian life.(vi)   A suggestion was also made that the GermanCommander at Narvik should be invited to give facilities for the civilian population to be evacuated by sea.     While this course mightwell prove impracticable, there could be no harm in drawing the attention of the Commander-in-Chief to it.(vii)   The view was strongly expressed that whatever decision might be taken on the present occasion,it would be impossible for long to avoid taking a decision on the question of principle.   Itwould be impossible to allow the Germans to convert Norwegian towns into forts and by keeping the civilians in the towns to prevent us from attacking.     This was equally truewhether we attacked from the sea or by land.(viii)   The view was expressed that the Government,having entrusted this difficult task to LordCork, would be wrong if they were now not totrust his judgment, or to fetter his judgmentby insisting on detailed conditions.   On theother hand, it was pointed out that theGovernment could not escape from politicalresponsibility for whatever action theCommander-in-Chief might take.

The War Cabinet:-(i)   Approved the despatch of a telegram tothe Flag Officer in Command on thelines of the First Lord of the Admiralty&apos;draft, modified, if necessary, to make clear the importance attached by theWar Cabinet to adequate warning being given:(ii)    Instructed the Deputy Chief of -naval staff to send a letter to the First Lordof the Admiralty (by means of one of1heparty leaving for Paris that afternoon)inviting the First Lord to inform thePrime Minister of the above decisionof the War Cabinet, in order that thePrime Minister might have an opportunity,if he thought fit, of countermanding the telegram which had been sent to the flag officer in Command.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.
