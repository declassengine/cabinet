CaptainFleming reported that the maintenance of any force at Namsos was dependent on Norwegian co-operation,which was practically non-existent, since Namsos was out of touch with the Norwegian Government and mostof the population had fled.    The town was practicallydestroyed.    Two wharves were still serviceable, butonly one could be used for unloading heavy material.General Audet considered that complete neutralisationof the enemy aircraft bases in the Trondhjem area was necessary before heavy stores could be -unloaded.A report had been received from General Carton deWiart on the previous evening giving the situationand asking for a decision on policy.MOST SECRET.

South of Trondhjem German penetration had caused the Norwegians and Morgan&apos;s force to withdraw from forward positions in the Lillehammer area.Morgan&apos;s Brigade was now reported to he at Oier, 11miles north of Lillehammer.      The Norwegian Commander-in-Chief was pressing for unified control under his orders, of all troops and railways in Norwegianterritory south of Trondhjem.       He asked that GeneralPaget should he placed under his command.      TheNorwegian Government were pressing for the reinforce-ments of an artillery regiment and a tank company forwhich they had previously asked.THE VICE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFread the telegram which had heen received fromGeneral Carton de Wiart the previous evening.     the battalion in the Verdal area was retiring, andthree companies at Vist, who were in touch with astrong enemy force, would attempt to retire at nightto Steinkjaer, which had been bombed and completely destroyed.     Brigadier Phillips had been ordered towithdraw by the Steinkjaer-Namsos road, but it was feared that when the enemy discovered the moveeverything on the road would be destroyed.       the move would in any case put a very heavy physicalstrain on the troops in the weather conditions prevailing.     Our men were unable to move off theroad owing to deep snow, which did not handicap theenemy, who were using snow shoes.     When the brigadearrived at Namsos they would find no accommodation,no water, no facilities and the bridge might not be

standing..    General Carton de Wiart envisaged that,in these circumstances, it might &quot;be necessary to evacuate the troops from Namsos.     The War office had replied asking him if it would he possible for him to hold on, since it was known that the germans themselves were in a bad way in this area.    It wascurious that General Carton de Wiart made no reference to the 3,000 French troops which had been landed at Namsos and which were equipped for movementover the snow.     These were fine troops, however, andno doubt they would make every endeavour to restore the situation.      General Audet, the French Commander,was under the orders of General Carton de Wiart.The Vice Chief of the Imperial General staff said that it had always been recognised that a landingoperation in face of superior air forces was extremelyhazardous, and indeed hardly practicable.     At Narvikthe enemy were not able to bring such a heavy scale of air attack to bear, and at Andalsnes it had beenpossible to put up some anti-aircraft defences beforeheavy air attack developed.     At Namsos conditions were at their very worst, and in his view it was doubtful whether the force there would be able to holdon.   The situation might, however,  improve whenfighter aircraft could be got ashore on the 25th April,which would deal with the enemy bombers in theTrondhjem area.Brigadier Morgan&apos;s force in the south had greatly heartened the Norwegians by their arrival atLillehammer, but there was a danger of the Germansadvancing up the eastern road as far as Koppang and

Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.thence pushing on to Irondhjem.     In this event,the whole of the Andalsnes force would he cut off from the north.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
