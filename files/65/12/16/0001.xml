(40^ 88nd CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex,(5th April, 1940),The War Cabinet were reminded that it hadbeen decided that the news of this Operation should hebroadcast, in order that our side of the case might reach the world before the Norwegians or Germans had time to put out their case.   Moreover, it was only bybroadcasting that shipping could be advised ofdangerous areas.    Since the mines would be laidat dawn,   we   should   probably   be   able   to broadcast our announcement at 8 a.m.    It was realised that the morning Press would resent the news of this operation appearing first on the broadoast.   for reasons of secrecy, however, it was clearly impossibleto give any advance information to the Press.   It wasagreed, however, that it would be desirable that anearly opportunity should be taken of explaining tothe Press why it had been necessary that the firstnews of the Operation should be published by the B.B, C.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL undertook to interviewrepresentatives of the Press for this purpose onMonday afternoon.It was also felt that it would be desirablethat the contents of our Notes to Norway and Swedenshould be published.    This might provide some smallconcession to the Press.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY undertook to examinethe text of the Notes, to make certain that they wouldbe suitable for publication.

THE FIRST SEA LORD, in answer to a question by the Foreign Secretary, said that the instructions issued to the naval Commanders who were to carry outthe Operation made it quite clear that they were notto be &quot;ridden off&quot; by Norwegian warships.     Theywere to make certain of laying the minefields,though only the minimum amount of force was to beused.     The possibility of an exchange of shotscould not, however, be excluded.     We had information that the armed forces of Norway had been ordered to resist infringement of their neutrality by force,but it seemed likely that the Norwegians at thepresent time were most afraid of a landing by troops.Their warships were* mostly disposed off their principalports.     Tho minefields, on the other hand, were to belaid at points distant from the principal ports, inorder that legitimate traffic to the ports should notbe in any way interfered with.     It seemed very probable, therefore, that our ships would be ableto carry out the actual laying of the mines withoutany interference.     After the minefields had been laid, we should leave patrols in Norwegian waters,for humanitarian reasons, to warn shipping of theexistence of the minesBTHE PRIME MINISTER said that he was most anxious to avoid the possibility of an armed conflict with Norwegian ships.     So far as the patrols were concerned, he suggested that if they were ordered outof territorial waters by Norwegian warships, theyshould point out the humanitarian reasons for their presence.     They should then withdraw, after making it quite clear to the Norwegian ships that theresponsibility for safeguarding shipping against thedanger of mines thereby passed into Norwegian hands.- 2 -

MloMaintenance of reserves forpossibleoperations in scandinavia,,The War Cabinet had before them aReport by the Chiefs of Staff submitting proposals for the machinery for setting in motion Plan Re4.  (WBP. (40) 117)   After ashort discussion the Report was approved^The War Cabinet then considered aReport by the Chiefs of Staff on the policy regarding forces for Scandinavia (W.P.(40) 118)aTHE CHIEF OP THE AIR STAPP introduced the Report, and said that the shipping whichit was recommended should be held in readiness;would only amount to about 8 store ships and 3liners.   The Chiefs of Staff had drawn upinstructions for the Commanders of the&quot;Avonmouth&quot; and &quot;Stratford&quot; forces, to whichthey would like the approval of the WarCabinet.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR thoughtthat the Policy recommended by the Chiefs ofStaff was only prudent.    If the Germans were going to react at all,they would probably do sovery shortly after we laid our minefield.   Weshould therefore probably soon know whether theforces to be held in readiness in the UnitedKingdom could be dispersed.

The War Cabinet:-(i)   Approved the procedure for setting in motion Plan R.4 recommended by theChiefs of Staff in paragraph 5 of theirReport,  (W,P. (40) 117),(ii)   Approved the policy for the maintenance of forces in readiness for operations in scandinavia,, including the holding ofthe necessary shipping, as detailed inparagraph 5 of the Chiefs of staff report,   (W,P.
