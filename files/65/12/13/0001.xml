(40) 16thConclusions,Minute 3. )W.M.(40) 71st CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.(18th March,    1940).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS drew attention to Telegram No. 47 DIPP.,dated 16th March, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;sArabaes*ado:??. Brussels, in which Sir LancelotOliphant reported that he had heen asked hyM. Spaak, the Belgian Minister of ForeignAffairs, for his views regarding a possible german attack on Belgium.    This telegram mightbe summarised as follows:-M. Spaak had said that the report thatvast quantities of German troops wereopposite the Belgian frontier was disquietingand that the number of German infantry unitshad recently been increased.    The fate off inland made him wonder what the positionof the Netherlands might shortly be.    Oneof the troubles in the case of Finland hadbeen the difficulty of getting foreigntroops to the country across neutralterritories.    If, for the sake of argument,the Germans attacked the Netherlands withoutattacking Belgium, what would be theattitude of Great Britain and France?   Hehad already, on 19th December, 1939, saidthat the position of the Netherlands wouldnot be a matter of indifference to Belgium,but he had then purposely used vaguephraseology, since Belgian aid would not be entirely automatic.   In his opinion, however,it would be parlous if the Netherlands,were to apply to Great Britain and france for assistance and nothing had been decided in advance.Sir Lancelot Oliphant had said that he -was unaware of any intention on the part ofthe Allies to send any expedition from Franceby means of Belgium.    M. Spaak had then saidthat he could visualise a situation in which

it?Belgium might wish to assist the Netherlandsso far as she could, hut this assistance wouldhave to be dependent on various factors,including (a) the attitude of the NetherlandGovernment, (b) the possibility of theNetherlands seeking help from Great Britainand Prance, and (c) the attitude of those powers to such an appeal.   Would the allies in that case contemplate sending troops acrossBelgium?   Sir Lancelot Oliphant had repliedthat he was unable to answer these questions,but would report them at once to His Majesty&apos;sGoveiximent.It was in his (the Secretary of State&apos;s)opinion encouraging that the Belgian Government shouldhave taken the initiative in this matter and, from thepolitical point of view, it was of great importance that, if possible, we should give a clear and definiteundertaking that in the circumstances contemplated weshould go to the aid of the Netherlands with all theresources at our disposal.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that a recent report prepared by the War Office on thepossibility of a German attack on the Low Countriesshowed how extensive were the German preparations forsuch an attack.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat so far as the Northern portion of the Germanline was concerned, everything was ready mounted foran attack.     Both the French and British militaryauthorities had made it clear to the Belgian GeneralStaff how important it was that we should enter Belgiumuthe moment her soil was violated by the German army.Our Military Attache&apos;&apos;had made a thorough reconnaissance of the ground, and General Gamelin was satisfied thathe could reach and hold the Wavre Line covering Brussels.

-ft GD ^At the present moment it would not he possiblefor us to send troops across Belgium into theNetherlands if the latter were attacked, since noplans had been prepared for such an operation.    If,however, the Belgians fulfilled their duty by goingto the assistance of the Netherlands, we should beable to come in behind them,   General Gamelin was satisfied that he could close the Scheldt and holdAntwerp and Brussels, but whether he could hold alsothe line of the Albert Canal was more doubtful, andwould depend on how much time he would have to moveup his troops.    It must be recalled that we had no knowledge of the military dispositions of the netherland   army.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that it was important that the Belgian Government should clearlyunderstand that if they were to lend assistanceto the Netherlands, we, in turn, would support them.It would seem as though, on this basis, we might nowbe able to start Staff Conversations with the Dutch.-THE PRIME MINISTER thought that what wasuppermost in M. Spaak8s mind was the possibility that Germany might attack the Netherlands withoutsimultaneously attacking Belgium.   The BelgianGovernment might well therefore be asking themselveswhether, in such circumstances, it would be possiblefor them to maintain their neutrality if they wereto agree to the passage of Allied troops acrossBelgium into the Netherlands.    Their position in that case would be very similar to that in which norway and Sweden had stood in regard to Finland,,

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY saidthat if the Netherlands were attacked, it was toour interest that Belgium should declare war on germany and should call on us for helpffl   Theymight well he influenced to take such a decisionif they knew in advance that it was likely that weshould demand a passage for our troops acrossBelgian soil^   for in that event clearly Belgium^would not be able to maintain her neutrality atthe expense of the Netherlands,,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that he thought the best coursewould be for him to telegraph to Sir LancelotOliphant instructing him to make a communication to the Belgian Government on the lines of theforegoing discussion.    The communication wouldmake the following pointsIf, in the event of a German attackon the Netherlands, Belgium went to theI   assistance of the Netherlands, His Majesty&apos;3j   Government have no doubt that the allies would at once come to the help of BelgiunuIf, in the event of a German attack on theNetherlands, the Belgian Government gave noactive assistance to the Netherlands, His        majesty&apos;s Government think that the allies would, if appealed to by the NetherlandGovernment, have no alternative but to goto their assistance, by operating airforces across, and by sending troops into,Belgiums    In either event, the extent and method or our assistance would depend largely on the dispositions taken by the netherland   Government, and without knowledgeof these dispositions iaanediate and effective assistance was not possible.  Anyreply made on these lines would have to beprovisional, pending discussion with theFrench 0

He proposed to consult with the Chiefs of Staff inregard to the terms of this telegrame     If, onreflection, he thought it necessary, he would submit the   draft   to   the    War Cabinet for approval beforedespatch.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it would hean advantage also to inform the Netherland Governmentof the approach made to us by the Belgian Government,and of our reply;   and that, without asking the netherland Government at the present stage to enterinto any binding obligations, we should say thatwe wished to know what would be their attitude to aproposal that the Allies should come to their assistance through Belgium, in the event of a GermanattackoThe War Cabinets-Authorised the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs -(i)   To address a communication to theBelgian Government in the mannerindicated in the passage markedSly&quot;(ii)   To make a communication to the netherland Government on the lines indicated in the passage markedchmond Terrace, S.W.I.

(40) 65thConclusions,Minute 4.)W.M. (40) 71st CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex.(18th March, 1940.)THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY saidthat the Naval Staff were examining the possibilityof a project for stopping the supply of iron oreto Germany from Lulea when that port became icefree0     The proposal was to send an aircraft carrier up the Norwegian coast from which aircraft would lay mines in the approaches to Lulea, andbomb ships in that port.     It might be possibleto launch torpedoes from aircraft against ships in that harbour and to block it.     This operation,once undertaken, would need to b.e carried outwith great rapidity, since no doubt the germans would either send up fighter aircraft themselvesor supply them to the Swedes for use against our bombers.     If such an operation were to be under-taken, it would be necessary to declare Lulea&quot;a close area&quot; in which all shipping would be in danger, since it would be impossible to discriminate between ships flying the German and those flyingother flags.    As soon as this scheme had been sufficiently examined by the Naval Staff, he proposed to submit it to the Chiefs of Staff forconsideration.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.richmond Terrace, 3.W.1,
