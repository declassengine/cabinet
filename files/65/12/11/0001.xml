(40) 65thConclusions,Minute 6.)W.M.  (40) 66th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 8.Confidential Annex.(12th March, 1940.)The War Cabinet had before them an aide-memoire by the Chiefs of Staff on Assistanceto Finland (C.O.S. (40) 264(S)).The War Cabinet were informed that admiral Evans had been selected as Naval Commanderfor the operations,and Major-General Mackesy as theMilitary Commander.It was proposed that the two Commandersshould embark with the first flight of the military force in a cruiser of the Arethusa class, whichwould be able to go alongside the jetty (or merchant-ship lying at the jetty) at Narvik.Discussion was then focussed on theprinciples governing the action by our Naval andMilitary Commanders as set out in paragraphs 8 to 11of the a ide-memo ir e.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY read out to the War Cabinet the orders which had been draftedfor the Naval Commander, and the CHIEF OF THEIMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF those which had been draftedfor the Military Commander.In reply to a question by the PrimeMinister, the CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that the defences of Narvik consisted of only two batteries armed with 4-inch guns.     At Trondhjem,however, there were 8-inch guns and 5.9-inch guns in the defences.

THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that, whilethe expedition could probably brush past the Narvikdefences., in spite of being fired on, the position was very different at Trondh.;era where it would be quite impossible for the ships to enter in the face of determined resistance.      It was therefore clearthat the orders to be issued to the Commanders at narvik might not be applicable to the force attempting to land at Trondhjem.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the instructions had assumed a differentshape from what he had visualised.     It had been generally agreed that our force should not allowitself to be deterred, from landing by a show of resistance, which might even cause a number of casulties.      The Chiefs of Staff recommended, however,that the Naval Commanders should be authorised to use-sufficient force to enable them to achieve their object.     This might mean that the ships would openfire and silence the forts - a use of far greaterforce against the Norwegians than he (the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs) had ever envisaged.     Hethought that it would be a profound mistake to use force to this extent, and moreover, if we did, he feltconvinced that the expedition would never get further than Narvik.Considerable further discussion ensued onthis aspect of the matter, the upshot of which is setout in the Conclusions to this Minute.

anThere was general agreement that theexpeditions to Narvik and Trondh^em presenteddifferent problems.     Further, if we succeeded inlanding at Narvik, without any appreciable use of force, we should probably find it easier to obtainfacilities for landing later at Trondhjem.   The WarCabinet favoured a landing at Narvik only in thefirst instance, the landing at Trondhjem beingpostponed until the outcome of the landing at&apos;Narvik was known;.Discussion ensued as to the despatchof forces to occupy Bergen and Stavanger, -concurrently with the Narvik force.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY deprecatedthe despatch of the expeditions to Bergen andStavanger, at any rate in the first instance.    Hesuggested that the simultaneous arrival of ourexpeditions at the four Norwegian ports would savourtoo much of a general attack with the object of occupying all the strategic points.    Stavanger andBergen were not on the way to FinlancUTEE PRIME MINISTER saw considerable forcein this argument.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed outthat the possession of Stavanger was most desirable in order to deny the aerodrome to the Germans, who might otherwise operate air forces from it against our shipping and the fleet at Scapa.After some further discussion, theWar Cabinet agreed that the Forces for Bergen andStavanger should be held in readiness but notdespatched,

him the course of discussion, the MINISTERWITHOOT PORTFOLIO said that he had refreshed his memoryon the landing of a Anglo-French Naval Brigade nearAthens in December, 1916, which the First Lord of theAdmiralty had mentioned on the previous day as apossible precedent.     The French Admiral, having failedto secure the agreement of the Greek Government to handover a number of guns to the Allies informed KingConstantino a day or two before the event that he was going to send his landing parties ashore on December laiuThus forewarned the Greek Government prepared to resist, and the Allied Force of three battalions of seamen and Marines, after advancing for some milestowards their objectives, encountered Greek troops.The French Admiral then proceeded to Athens tonegotiate.     But as soon as their concentration was complete the Greeks opened fire and fighting becamegeneral.   Some French detachments were surrounded andthe French Admiral had to signal to the ships to fire on the Stadium.     Eventually the Greek Governmentoffered as a compromise to hand over six batteriesof Mountain Artillery, and during the night the allied naval Brigade was re-embarked after sustaining over200 casualties.     The point emphasised by the minister without Portfolio was that the result of the warning of intention to land forces was active resistancewhich led to fairly heavy casualties,

HiThe War Cabinet agreed:-(l) The operation should be confined tothe landing at Narvik in the firstinstance.   The despatch of the Narvikforce should proceed according to thetime-table already approved.(2) The departure, of the force forTrondhjem should be so arranged asto enable the landing at Trondh.ifimto be effected as soon as instructions were given after news was received of a successful landing at Narvik.(3) The forces for Stavanger and Bergenshould not leave this country until further orders, but should be availableto sail at short notice.(4) A meeting should be held for thediscussion of the instructions tobe issued to the Naval and military commanders .   This meeting would be attended by -The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence,The Minister without Portfolio,The three Chiefs of Staff, andThe Naval and Military Commanders.^Note: This meeting was held&apos; at 6.30 p.m.on 12th March.   The instructions were discussed and approved, and the government-ments intensions explained to theCommander 6.*/(5) The following were the main points madein discussion, bearing on the instructionsto be issued to the Naval and military commanders(a) The Commanders should be instructedthat they should not be deterred bya mere show of resistance or by minoropposition, and that they must beprepared to put up with a certainamount of opposition withoutretaliating.(b) At the same time the Naval andMilito.ry Commanders should not be instructed that they were not tofire in any circumstances, but thatthey wore only to use force &quot;as an ultimate measure of self-defence should their forces be in jeopardy&quot;.(c) It follows from (b) that the Navaland Military Commanders should avoid,if possible, placing the ships or thetroops in a position from which it was

likely that they could only beextricated by the use of appreciablefor ce.(d) The Naval Commander should be author-is ed to disregard a warning shot andto proceed until circumstances developedthat would oblige hin to exercise&apos; force to a degree needed to overcomedeliberate formal opposition.    If that stage was reached, the Naval Commandershould proceed on shore and parley.(6) The following points were made in regardto the landing at Trondhjem.   As explained above, this landing would not be attempteduntil it x-ras known what progress was beingmade by the force landed at Narvik. If allwent well with the Narvik force, it was probable that the landing at Trondhjemwould not present any great difficulty.On the other hand, if the landing at Narvikwas a failure, no useful purpose would be served in attempting to land at Trondhjem.It was undesirable that the ships carrying the force for Trondhjem should remain in theoffing, where German submarines were almost certain to be operating, longer than was absolutely necessary.    In the event of the landing at Trondhjem boing attempted, theNaval- Commander should be guided by theprinciples set out in (5) above.   In view ofthe strength of the Trondhjem defences,however, no attempt should be made to enter the harbour against resistance.(7) No communication should be made tothe Government of Norway as to our intentionto land a force at Narvik until the transportshave actually arrived.     Our Minister atOslo should be instructed to deliver a pre-arranged communication to the norwegian government, as soon as the news of the landinghas been received.g

Finnish THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSGovernmentsreferred to Telegram No. 198 which had been receivedj)ppeal.on the previous night from our Minister in Helsingfors,transmitting a request from the Finnish Government thatan immediate further appeal should be made by the Frenchand British Governments to the Swedish and Norwegian Governments to permit the passage of Allied troops.On receipt of this telegram he had, after consulting thePrime Minister, sent a telegram to our Ministers in stockholm and Oslo, instructing them to make this furtherappeal.   He had done this in the belief that it would fall in with the wishes of the French, who had been soinsistent on our taking immediate action in Scandinavia,and also because he had thought that it might help the finns in their negotiations with the Russians,.   The french ambassador had, however; been to see him, both on theprevious night and that morning, to urge that we shoulddesist from making this demarche in Norway and Sweden, onthe grounds that this was an intrigue on the part ofM8 Tanner, and that moves were being made in Oslo andStockholm with which we ought not to be associated.   He(The Foreign Secretary) had not at first been disposed to cancel the instructions, hut, finding that the Frenchintended to abstain from similar action, he now inclined to the view that the disadvantages of appearing not toSeep in Step with the -French outweighed the advantages of such encouragement as we might give - to the Finns .in taking independent action in Stockholm and Oslo.   &apos;He therefore   proposed,  s^b^ect to the approval of theTThe   War   Cabinet,   to hold - up   the   Instructions

which had heen sent to our Ministers at those places,unless - as was possible - they had already acted upon them.The War Cabinet approved the action proposedby the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsTHE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that he hadvernment&apos;stitude.        dined with M. Daladier on the previous evening, M. Legerand M. Daladier&apos;s Chef de Cabinet being the only other persons present.   The Finnish situation had beendiscussed in an atmosphere of great friendliness -   theFirst Lord having taken the opportunity to impress upon M. Daladier how much the Prime Minister relied uponthe co-operation of M. Daladier.    M. Daladier had expressed approval of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the House on the previous day and, in particular,with his answer to a Supplementary Question.   He had,at the same time, heen quite frank in stating the complaints of the French against us.    Their realgrievance was that the preparations had in their viewgone too slowly and ponderously.   Could not our statementshave put &quot;the matter in c more favourable .light? TkmWm&amp;Qh, wessdesperately frightened that the Finns would make peace.Could not something, therefore, be said at once?After leaving M. Daladier, the First lord had gone to see M. Reynaud, who had spoken in the samestrain, taking the view that the loss of Finland wouldbe equivalent to the loss of a great campaign.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

(40) 65thConclusions,Minute 7.)W.M.(40) 66th CONCLUSIONS . MINUTE 3.Confidential AameSo(12th March, 1940.)THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY informed the War Cabinet that he had flown to Paris on theprevious afternoon to see General Gamelin on thesubject of the Royal Marine operation.     General   vGaraelin had strongly supported the immediateexecution of this operation as planned, but had sai&amp;Hsfcthe Council had asked for more time.     He (the FirstLord) had asked M. Daladier, with whom he had dined,the reason for this delay.     M. Daladier ke&amp; explainedthat he himself had gone to the Meeting of theCouncil fully prepared to support the immediatelaunching of the operation.     This attitude had beenshared by all who were present at the Meeting, withthe exception of the French Air Minister who had madea special case for a postponement of three weeks, onthe plea of some 300 aircraft which were nowassembled at Villacoublay and which he feared wouldbe made a target for reprisal by the Germans.     TheFirst Lord had argued that it should not take threeweeks to remove these aircraft, and M. Daladier had promised to look into the matter.     Unless, however,the delay could be reduced to a few days, he (theFirst Lord) would prefer to postpone the wholeoperation for a month, so as to combine the Naval andAir parts of the operation at one and the same time.He had, however, impressed upon M. Daladier his

anxiety to press on with the operation if possible at once with the fluvial mines, and had reinforcedthis view with a letter.     He would inform the WarCabinet of M, Daladier&apos;s reply as soon as he receivedit.The views of the French on the subject ofthe proposed warning were that this was unnecessary.The Germans had emphasised that the Rhine was a purelyGerman river and not an International Waterway.     TheFrench would not, for example, dream of giving anywarning of their intention to shell the Rhine.     If,however, the British War Cabinet were to demur to theproposal &quot;that there should be no warning, the Frenchsuggested that it would suffice that a private warning-as opposed to a world statement - should be made to theDutch and Belgian Governments alone, to be delivered atthe same moment as we had intended that the public statement should be broadcast.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs made the suggestion which, however, he did not press,that the disadvantage of the private warning was thatit might not give the Dutch and Belgian Governmentssufficient time to communicate it to their barges upthe Rhine.K2S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR mentioned,as an argument in favour of the immediate execution ofthe operation, that it was now becoming common knowledgein France.The War cabinet took note that the date of decision asto when the Royal Marine operation0 should start must be deferred, pendingthe receipt of a reply from M. Daladierto the First Lord of the Admiralty.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
