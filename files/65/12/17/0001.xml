It was therefore

IISconceivable that, while the Norwegian Government was prepared to co-operate generally, some opposition from the local troops might he encountered.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that the words at the beginning of appendix B to Enclosure I, viz: &quot;(These notes are based on the assumption that Norwegian co-operation is forthcoming eventually)&quot; might be somewhatmisleading, in view of the wording in the draft instructions in Enclosure I.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFagreed that it would be better to omit these wordseThe War Cabinet:Agreed to approve the instructionsto Commanders for Plan R.4, as setout in W.

After some further discussion, THEPRIME MINISTER agreed that the Naval Commandersshould he instructed to place guards on hoardany German ships which might he present at the ports in question, and that the question of removing the ships from Norwegian Waters, orscuttling the ships ourselves, should he a matter for decision at the time, in the event of our forces being withdrawn.The War Cabinet;Agreed to approve the instructions for Naval Commanders, subject tothe amendment of paragraph 10, inthe light of the discussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
