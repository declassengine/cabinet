THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.I SECRET. COPY NO.  / -W.M.  (40) 104th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 3.Confidential Annex.(26th April, 1940.)$RATIONSNORWAY.reviousference:   -11.(40) 103rdnclusions.nute 3. )widhjem and,e Southern&apos;ont.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the military co-operation-ordination Committee, which had just met, had been considering the situation, and in particular a Papershowing what the position in Norway would be if wesucceeded in taking Trondhjem.    Before Trondhjem could beused by us as a base, it would require about 50 heavy and 80light A.A. guns - and even then we should have some difficulty in using the port against the extremely heavyscale of air attack which could be brought to bear upon it.Moreover, to secure the maintenance of our forces in norway would require the efforts of the greater partof the Home Pleet, which would be exposed to risks which we should be unwilling to take in viev/ of thepossible attitude of Italy.    If Italy joined our enemies,we should be unable to deal with her while, at the sametime, attempting to maintain forces in Trondhjem andNarvik.While this would be the situation in the eventof our capturing Trondhjem, it was clear that withoutTrbndhjem there was very little we could do in centralNorway.    The diversion of strength that we shouldhave to make to try and maintain forces ashorewould be disproportionate to the ends we mightachieve,     Por this reason, the Committee had come

to the conclusion that plans should he got ready forevacuating our forces from Andalsnes and Namsos incase of need, though we should in the meanwhile do everything possible to continue our resistance to theGerman advance.It could not be denied that to admitfailure in Norway would be serious to our prestige,but we might mitigate the effects of our withdrawalif we could present to the world the picture that wehad only gone into central Norway in order to gaintime for the achievement of our real object, which wasthe   capture of Narvik.      In the meanwhile, the attackon Narvik would depend to some extent upon the thaw.There was some discussion on the progressof operations at Narvik, and on what our action shouldbe when it had been captured.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatthe Chasseurs Alpins had now arrived, and should beable to operate on skis.      Very little was known ofthe intentions of Lord Cork, but he did not thinkmuch could be done until the snow melted.     Once wehad captured Narvik, the important thing would be to collect adequate forces there, so as to be ready tomeet any German advance through Sweden, and to takeadvantage of any opportunity to get to Lulea.     Whileit was true that we could not enter Sweden unlessGermany made the first move, he did not think that theGermans would be content to leave their garrison at narvik to surrender, and that we should soon see themattempting to send forces through Sweden.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that, as soon as we had withdrawn from centralNorway, the Germans would turn the whole of their attention to Narvik,     To this extent Namsos was.anoutpost   for Narvik,     Every day we were able to holdout in central Norway would be of great advantage inour operations further North.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR expressed agreement with this view.     He thought that theestablishment of an aerodrome near Narvik was of thevery greatest importance, particularly as air attackon the shipping from Lulea, and the laying of mines,might prove the only means of interrupting thesupplies of iron ore.     He very much doubted whether these operations could be effectively carried out fromcarriers.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER enquire whether a withdrawal from the Trondhjem area would notbe in sharp contrast with the conclusions recently arrived at by the Supreme War Council, which placedTrondhjem as the first objective for our operations.He thought it might prejudice secrecy to have to tell the French of our proposed withdrawal.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, althoughTrondhjem was the first objective in point of time, in point of importance the French had always insisted onNarvik and the iron ore as the only objective worthworrying about in Scandinavia,       He thought we shouldnot have to inform the French when the withdrawal wouldtake place.       The Chief of the Imperial General staff was going over to explain things to General Gamelin..

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Swedes had now agreed not to allowanything more to pass through Sweden to Narvik, or toTrondhoem.    It appeared that the Germans had behaved verydeceitfully over the goods which they had asked to send.Reactions on Discussion ensued as to the probable effects onpublicopinion. public opinion when it &quot;became known that we had withdrawn.our forces from central Norway,    It was agreed that this move would mean a loss of prestige, and that there mightbe a sharp reaction, particularly in the Balkans.    our best line might be that the landing of forces in centralNorway had never been intended as more than a diversion.It was also pointed out that a   severe reactionon public opinion here might be expected.    Nevertheless,it was of such vital importance to maintain absolutesecrecy in regard to the withdrawal of our forces from central Norway that no possible hint must be given to thePress before the withdrawal had taken place.    From thepoint of view of secrecy, it would be necessary to givea very severe warning to the French.It was pointed out that, from the point of viewof public opinion, it would be very helpful if we couldcombine an announcement of the withdrawal from centralNorway with an announcement of the capture of Narvik.It looked, however, as though it might not be possibleto achieve the latter before we had to carry out theformer.The War Cabinet took note of theabove discussion.
