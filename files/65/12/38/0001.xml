COPY NO.    f 2-W.M.(40)  1Q7TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.-------- Confidential Annex.(29th April,1940).OPERATIONS IN THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR explainedNORWAY.that as a result of discussions which had taken place(previous reference: in the War Office during the previous night on theW.M. (40) 106thConclusions, latest information regarding the situation at Namsos,Minute,10. )it had heen decided to make a change in the plans forNaras os.the evacuation of that area.      These changes were basedon the discovery that the road from Namsos to Mosjoenwas not as impracticable as had been thought, and thatit would admit of the passage of a limited number oftroops and mechanical transport.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat instructions had accordingly been sent to GeneralCarton de Wiart which would result in the evacuationbeing effected as follows:-(i)   A part of the forces at Namsos would leave by sea as originally plannedon the nights of the lst/2nd and2nd/3rd May.(ii)    The remainder would be divided into two parties.      The strength of these parties would depend on the amount of availabletransport, all of which was to be devoted   -to them.      Each of the parties would begiven two b of ors guns. /The question was raised whether these parties could not begiven additional anti-aircraft guns - tobe drawn, for example, from those destined for Narvik - and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff undertook to see whetherthis might not be possible^/One of these parties would start forMosjoen at once.

The other party - probably comprising the chasseurs Alpins - would go to Grong onthe Worth side of Namsos Fjord.    It wouldbe organised as a rearguard, with the role of barring the road from Namsos toMosjoen, and would retire only whenforced to do so by the enemy.    Byfighting and demolitions,  this force would endeavour to hold the enemy up as long aspossible,,(iii)     Preparations would be put in hand for thedefence of Mosjoen, Mo, and Bodo.The Chief of the Imperial General staff explained that the advantages of this change of planwere twofold.    First, it laid the foundation of a fresharea of resistance in Northern Norway, which would addconsiderable depth to the defence of Narvik.    Secondly,it would considerably ease the problem of ourevacuation from Namsos by reducing the numbers whichwould be leaving by sea.    This was of great importance,as it was to be expected, as a result of our having already left Andalsnes, that the Germans would turnall their air forces on to attacking us at Namsos.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,without in any way disputing the military wisdom of using the Chasseurs Alpins to act as rearguard, askedwhether there might not be political objections in leaving it entirely to the French to carry out this task.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat the choice had been made at the pressing requestof General Gamelin.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR added that, asski-ing troops, the French alone.would be suitable tocarry out the duty of rearguard.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that -a.,,telegram had heen received on the previous night fromGeneral Paget, protesting that he could probably hold the situation provided he was given artillery support and means of defence against air attack0     In thelight of this telegram and also of an appeal which hadbeen received from the Norwegian Commander-in-Chief,careful consideration had been given to whether anychange should be made in the decision which had beentaken on the 27th April to evacuate the Andalsnes area.While this matter had been under consideration, afurther telegram had been received from Brigadier Hogg.This telegram and other information tended clearly toshow that the situation at the base had deteriorated.It had accordingly been decided that the decision to evacuate should stand;    and a telegram to General Pagethad accordingly been despatched, instructing him toexplain to the Norwegian Commander-in-Chief that conditions at the base had become such as to make further reinforcement impossible, and that the only way in which to preserve the Norwegian forces wouldbe to withdraw them by sea, with a view to landing themelsewhere.THE PRIME MINISTER said that lie had given full weight to the views which had been expressed byGeneral Paget as the man on the spot.      It was truethat he (General Paget) had suggested that he couldcarry on, but it was to be noted that he had qualifiedthis with the proviso that he must have defence against air attack.     This meant that he required fighters.   Thefact, however, was that we possessed no aerodromes in norway from which our fighters could operate.     He (the

Prime Minister) had consulted the Secretary of ,SiaJke for War, the Vice Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff and General Massy that morning,  and they had unanimously agreed that there had been no change inthe situation which would justify a reversal of thedecision which had heen taken to evacuate theAndalsnes area.      They had said that our forces there might conceivably hold out for a few days, but thatit would be quite out of the question that theyshould do so for any length of time.     To attemptto hold on,  even for a short while,  would probablymean losing the 15th Brigade.     Delay,  even ofa week, might result in our being unable either to reinforce or to evacuate the force.      It had therefore been decided that the reply to General Paget should leave no doubts in his mind that the orders for evacuation stood.In regard to the appeal from the NorwegianCommander-in-Chief,  the Prime Minister said that hehad very little sympathy with the Norwegians.     Theyhad offered little or no resistance.     When theGermans had come down one side of the Osterdalrailway, the Norwegians had moved down the other side,without making any attempt to fight.      permission toblow up the railway had even been withheld from theBritish Officer who had been specially sent to norway for this purpose.     At the same time, it

was obviously undesirable, on political grounds3that they should manoeuvre us into the positionof appearing to desert them.      General Paget had accordingly been instructed to see the NorwegianOommander-in-Ghief and to offer him means of evacuating his troops.      If he refused,  the factthat we had left the Norwegians behind would be his, and not our, responsibility.The Prime Minister said that he hadno doubts in his own mind that the decision to evacuate the Andalsnes area was the right one on strategic grounds.     Not only would it enable usto concentrate on securing and consolidating ourposition at Narvik;   but it would also facilitatethose operations by giving us control of aconsiderable stretch of the north coast of Norway.THE FIRST LORD OF THE) ADMIRALTY agreed.It would be impossible for the 3,000 or 4,000 troops which we had in the Andalsnes area, even withartillery and fighters,  to resist the force,amounting probably to 90,000, of Germans, who weremoving up the railway from Oslo,,     This was afurther reason for developing operations in theNorth.     At the same time,  it appeared as if Genera&quot;1Paget might be about to become involved in an actionwhich he would have the greatest difficulty inbreaking off,THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that under present arrangements the evacuation of Andalsnes was due to take place on the nights ofthe S9.th/30th April and 30th April/1 si. May. .

Consideration was given to thedraft of a telegram to the British ambassador in Paris giving information for the benefitof M.  Reynaud about the plan of operations in Norway.Various changes in the text were suggested and agreed, giving due emphasis tothe fact that a plan was being made to create a new and extended area of operations betweenMosjoen and Narvik,,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY read a telegram received from Sir Cecil Dormerat Norwegian Headquarters,  reporting that theNorwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs con-sidered that the situation created by our decision to evacuate was so serious that itmight put an end to Norwegian resistance.    Hehad instructed the Norwegian Minister inLondon to oppose this policy.      Sir CecilDormer urged that it was important that weshould do everything possible to hold theconfidence of the Norwegian Government, andthat, if evaluation was to be carried out, weshould take steps to remove the King of norway and the Norwegian Government to a place of safety.      The First Lord added thatas regards the latter, the necessary arrange-ments had been made,THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was clear from an interview with M, Colban thatthe Norwegian Government were aware of our intention to evacuate our forces fromAndalsnes and Namsos0

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that,  in^vSt)presenting the case to the Press and public opinion,we should not refer to evacuation but should explain that the operation to be carried out constituted aredistribution of our forces for the better defenceof Northern Norway.    We were in no sense abandoning the Norwegian Army;    on the contrary, we were takingthe measures in order to be of more assistance tothem.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that it was important to make it clea.r that we were re-forming thedefence.    On the other hand, the greatest care should be taken that no public reference should bemade to any of the places north of Namsos where we proposed to dispute the German advance.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL referred to the followingResolution passed by the Supreme v7ar Council on the27th April:-&quot;That the Ministers of Information of thetwo countries should be instructed to concert together with a view to securing a common treatment in the Press of thetwo countries of events in Scandinavia.&quot;In discussion, the view was expressed that theMinister of Information should be very guarded in discussion with his French colleague. For example,dates and places of impending operations in Norway,or future military dispositions, should not be mentioned.THE PRIME MINISTER said that one main objectof the consultation would be to inform the french minister of Information of the methods of presenta-tion which we proposed to follow, in order to avoidadministering too great a shock to our publicopinion.   A second main object would be theprevention of indiscretions on the part of theFrench Ministry of Information.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements..W.1. -7-
