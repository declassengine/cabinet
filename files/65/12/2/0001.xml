THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.It most   SECRET.COPY NO.W.M.(40^    57TH CONCLUSIONS.(1st March, 1940).11.ASSISTANCE to finland.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 56thConclusions,Minute 1).THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that, before dealing with the latest developments in the Finnish situation, he would like to read to theWar Cabinet a telegram which had been sent off to stockholm and Oslo   as a result of the Meeting ofthe War Cabinet which had,been held that morning. j/SeeTelegrams No. 9&apos;3 to Stockholm and No. 70 toOslojjThe Foreign Secretary said that the WarCabinet would notice that the Norwegian and swedish governments were not being asked to grant passage;they were being told that we should be requestingpassage, and their co-operation would be sought when therequest was made.     The object of this was that it had always appeared that our request for passage would gainadded force if it were made when the troops were actually ready to land.   He had thought that, as aresult of this communication, the Governments of norway and Sweden would probably ask us to reconsiderour intentions to demand passage.     A period wouldthen ensue   during which discussions would continue,until the moment would arrive when we could say to themabruptly that our troops were ready, and we intended tocome through.The War Cabinet expressed their general agreementwith the terms of the telegram, but the FIRST LORD OF

nTHE ADMIRALTY suggested that it would he betterif the paragraph was omitted in which it was statedthat, if the Norwegian and Swedish Governmentsrefused our request, we should have to make this fact public, and they would bear responsibilityfor the failure to save Finland.     The ideacontained in that paragraph would be present to the minds of the Norwegians and Swedes, but by expressingit to them ourselves, we might give the impression that if they refused their co-operation, the only thing that would happen would be that they would bear the condemnation of the world.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had always felt that publicity would be an important element in the pressure which would be brought tobear on the Norwegians and Swedes, but he agreedthat it might be better not to foreshadow it atthis particular stage.The view was expressed that it would bebetter to say that our preparations were &quot;alreadyfar advanced&quot; rather than that they were &quot;in hand&quot;.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs undertook to send telegrams to Stockholm and Osloamending in the sense desired the communication tobe made to the Norwegian and Swedish Governments.The Foreign Secretary then informed theWar Cabinet that the Finnish Minister had called on him during the afternoon, and had told him that theFinnish military situation was serious.     The finnish government had to make up their minds whether toenter into negotiations with the Russians.     They

would have to decide in the course of the nexttwenty-four hours, and their decision would helargely governed by the amount of immediate assistance which could be furnished by the Frenchand British.     He had been instructed by hisGovernment, therefore, to ask the followingspecific questions:-(i)   Could the French and British provide,immediately, 100 bombers with crews?(ii)   Could the French and British send 50,000men to arrive in Finland before the endof March, and could these be followed by further reinforcements?     If these troops could be sent, would we be prepared toallow them to fight anywhere in Finlandas required by the situation and underthe orders of the Finnish General Staff.(iii)   Would we bring pressure on Norway and sweden to agree to the passage of these troops?   Would we confirm that,  if thisagreement was not forthcoming, we wouldnot allow that to affect our decision tohelp Finland?He understood that a similar communicationhad been made to the French Government.     TheFinnish Minister in Paris had apparently told theFrench that the decision of his Government had beenheld up for a further twenty-four hours, and thathe had received a telegram from Marshal Mannerheimasking for:-(i)    50,000 Allied volunteers to start theirjourney to Finland before the end ofMarch, if possible.(ii)   The Allies to make their approach to stockholm and Oslo.

(iii) 50 bombers to be sent immediately with british pilots to enable the Finnishforces to gain time,M. Daladier was understood to be examiningthese proposals.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that the Chiefsof Staff had only had a short time to examine thelatest Finnish request, but they offered the following observations:-(a) 100 bombers, which were equivalent to 8 &quot;or 9Squadrons, could not be moved to Finland in less than30 days.    Two or three thousand men, and much equipment,would have to be sent by rail.    If these bombers wereheavy day bombers, the request would amount to two-thirds of our available force.    If it was for medium bombers, it should be remembered that the bulk of ourmedium bombers were in France,    We could only meet this request by seriously denuding ourselves.(b) 50,000 men meant 4 Divisions.     Even if thewhole of the force destined for Southern Sweden werediverted to Finland (a suggestion which would hardlymeet with the approval of the Swedes) a seoond division would have to be withdrawn from France to make up thenumber.     Under the operation now being planned, troops would land as fast as possible?   even so, only twelveto thirteen thousand would have got ashore in Norwayby the end of March.     If our forces operated in southern Finland, they would be liable to be cut off by Germans landing in the Gulf of Bothnia after the ice melted,     A further 20,000 men would be required tohold the lines of communication,

A further 20,000 men would be required tohold the lines of communication.

It was thus clearly impossible for us tocomply with the Finnish demands.At this point a message was received,giving the following further details of the demarchemade by the Finnish Minister in Paris:-The requests made by Marshal Mannerheimwere as previously imported from Paris.   M, daladier had told the Finnish Minister in reply that theFrench   Government were prepared to accede tothe Finnish request on all points.    The french troops were ready and were awaiting Britishtransports. M. Daladier was considering whether he eould spare any bombers j   and was urging theBritish Government to hasten the despatch of forces.    The French Government were prepared,ifnecessary, to override   the   objections of theSwedish and Norwegian Governments.It was generally agreed that this wasa most disquieting message,and that the French action was a bad example of lack of co-operation.   TheFrench were apparently prepared to bluff, knowingthat they could throw on to us the whole blame forthe failure to redeem their promises, as we had undertaken the direction of the enterprise.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said he would have to see M. Corbin tofind out what had prompted the French action, andto put before him our views.

Discussion then turned on the immediate action which should he taken in respone to the appeal by the Finns.     The following were the principal points made:-(i)   Blenheim bombers would probably be the mostsuitable, hut we had only 4 operationalsquadrons in this country and 2 reservesquadrons.     The Finnish repair and main-tenance organisation would only suffice tomaintain 12 aircraft in addition to theirexisting forces.     It was suggested that eventhe despatch of 12 Blenheims would be of some assistance, but on the other hand it waspointed out that we were very seriouslydeficient in this type of aircraft.     to despatch 12 Blenheims would weaken us without causing any corresponding diversion of force from our main enemy, which was Germany.     Itwould therefore be an unsound detachment.The collapse or resistance of the Finnscould hardly depend on so small a contribution.If we attempted to send larger numbers, itwould be extremely doubtful if we should eversee them again;    and, even if they were toreturn, their squadron organisation wouldhave been entirely broken up.(ii)    It was no^. clear why the military situationin Pin.land_.had deteriorated so very rapidly.It was doubtful whether Field marshal mannerheim was really at the end&quot;&quot;ef &quot;hrs-------------tether, and it might be that there was a

difference between him and his Government..Probably the Finns were being pressed by &quot; &quot;the Russians to accept a settlement, underthe threat of worse to follow if they refusedthe terms offered.      They could hardly imagine that   it was physically possible for us tosend them the assistance for which they asked, but they might be making the appealso as to be able to say, if they surrendered,that they had done so because they had been refused the help which was essential to savethem.(iii)   When the ice melted in about six weeks&apos; time,the Germans would be masters of the Balticseaboard and would have Scandinavia in their power.      This could only be avoided if westruck now and got a footing in Galivarcand Lulea.     We should, therefore, make everyiendeavour to induce the Finns to continue thestruggle, retiring northwards to the  head ofthe Gulf of Bothnia, where our troops would arrive to support the remnants of their Army,(iv)   The willingness of the Finns to continue thestruggle seemed to depend on our acceptanceof a demand for assistance which it was not within our power to provide.     On the otherhand the Finns would probably realise that a country which refused to surrender, eventhough almost completely overrun, might ultimately re-emerge and regain itsterritories, as Belgium had done in the last war.      If Finland surrendered she wouldprobably disappear as a nation for ever.

(v)   The Norwegians and Swedes wc:.-c unlikely to go so far as to oppose an Allied landingby force of arms.     Once we had got a footing in the Norwegian ports there wasa good chance of being able to secureGalivare, which was our main objective.,We mi$it succeed in doing this oven ifthe Germans, after our landing, broughtpressure to hear on the Swedes to withdraw their rolling stock and cut off the electric current from their railways,(vi)   The Finnish Minister had asked what weshould do if the Norwegians and Swedesrefused passage to our troops.     TheForeign Secretary had replied that weshould take every possible step to landour forces short of actual fcS&amp;s^steed, but.   , , .... ipfe.e a-had reserved our position i^^^^^s^^^possibility of Swedish and Norwegian(vii)   Part of our original conception had beenthat, if we sent forces into Scandinavia,we would thereby encourage the Swedes to release some of their own Army to go tothe help of the Finns.     This idea mightbe brought to the notice of the swedish government at this juncture.      It waspointed out, however, that it was not likely to carry much weight with the swedes, whose fear of Germany would beincreased by our arrival in their countryand who would therefore be less likelythan ever to spare forces for Finland.

THE SS.CRLTARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs then read over a draft telegram which he proposed to despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Helsingfors,,This was designed to present to the finnish government, in the most favourable light, the offer of the assistance which we were prepared to make inorder to encourage them to resist.In the discussion on this draft, it was generally agreed that it was essential to send to the finns the most encouraging message possible.     Itshould be made clear to them that the limiting factoron the scale of our assistance was the transport facilities available in Scandinavia.     Moreover, thevery despatch of Allied forces would mean that theBritish Empire and France were whole-heartedly behind the Finns&apos;and would do all in their power to support them.     The Finns should be told that we had alreadyapproached the Swedish and Norwegian Governments toallow the passage of the Allied forces and that wewere awaiting their reply.     A message in these terms would in effect be a reply to the appeal which had just been received, and would he much more encouragingthan a specific reply to the requests they had made,which would inevitably have to be a refusal.The War Cabinet; -Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs -(i)   To telegraph to His Majesty&apos;ministers at Oslo and Stockholmamending the terms of the communication to be made to theNorwegian and Swedish Governments,as agreed at (A) above.

To send a telegram to His Majesty&apos;minister at Helsingfors, drafted onthe lines of the discussion reported at (B) above (see Telegram No. 95 HIPPto Helsingfors).To inform the Finnish Minister in london in the sense of the telegram referredto in (ii) above.To inform the French Ambassador inLondon:-(a) That we took note of M. Daladier&apos;reply to the appeal by the Finnish minister in Paris.(b) That in our opinion it was notpossible for the Allies to fulfil the offer which M. Daladier had made.(c) That, in order to give the Finnsas much encouragement as possible,we were instructing His Majesty&apos;minister in Helsingfors in accordancewith the telegram referred to in (ii).
