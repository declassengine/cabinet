a. -THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE  KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.MOST SECRET.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.(IOPERATIONS in norway.(previous reference:JU. (40) 105thConclusions,Minute 2. )W.M.(40) 106TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 10.Confidential Annex.(28th April, 1940. )-   THE PRIME MINISTER explained that in the lightof the latest information received from Norway, theMilitary Co-ordination Committee, at a meeting held theprevious evening, had decided that immediate orders shouldhe given for the withdrawal of our troops from theAndalsnes and Namsos areas.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said thathe had seen General Gamelin, and had explained thesituation to him.      General Gamelin fully agreed that itwas impossible for us to stay in Southern Norway.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER referred to thedecision of the Supreme War Council that a study shouldbe made of the question how best to check the forwardadvance of the Germans by land in the direction of Narvik.Would it be possible to employ for this purpose any of thetroops which it was proposed to evacuate from southern norway?THE PRIME MINISTER said that while on general grounds it was desirable that the withdrawal should be delayed as long as possible, it was essential that thewithdrawal from Andalsnes should be carried out in a singleoperation.      The position might be summarised as follows:-(i)    the position as regards Namsos was not sourgent; but once the Germans knew that we werewithdrawing from Andalsnes, they would no doubtconcentrate the whole weight of their attack onNamsos.*

(ii)    British forces at Namsos had suffered suchheavy losses that it would he necessaryfor them to he reorganized before theycould be of &quot;any. further use.(iii)    Neither the Territorial Units at Namsosnor the Regular Forces at Andalsnes wereequipped for guerilla warfare..(iv)   What was proposed, therefore, was thatwe should organize bands of suitablytrained and equipped men;    these bandswould be landed at suitable points onthe Norwegian coast and their functionwould be to make obstructions by thedestruction of viaducts, ferries, etc. onthe road (at present still under snow)from Namsos to Narvik which the germans would need to use in their advancenorthward..      It was thought that thiswas the best method available to us ifnot for maintaining our hold on southern norway, at least for avoiding its totalabandonment.n of THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that troops,a point of honour to our Arms arose in connectionwith the proposed evacuation,which made it impossiblefor us to abandon such Norwegian troops as had actually been co-operating with us in the line,.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that orders had already been issued that any Norwegiantroops who so desired should be evacuated at the sametime as the British Forces.    It was doubtful, however,to what extent the Norwegian Forces were still in being.    It seemed likely that most of them had already-dispersed into the hills.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that it had been necessary to issue orders to the Commander-in-Chief,Home Fleet, regarding the proposed evacuation fromAndalsnes, since it fell to him to assemble thenecessary craft.      It had now been decided that thefinal evacuation should be carried out in a singlenight; and in consequence it was proposed to evacuate

the Norwegians in small parties before the finalnight in order that the troops then to be evacuated should not be beyond our capacity to remove.It had to be realised, however, that there wasdanger in informing the Norwegians too soon of our intention to withdraw, since thereby the germans might learn of what was proposed.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it would benecessary also to make provision for the evacuation of the King of Norway and the norwegian government, should they decide to leave Norway.In reply to a question by the minister without Portfolio,  THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WARsaid that it would not be necessary to abandonany material or military equipment of value, except possibly the twelve    Eofors guns which had been landed.      These would, of course, be blown up ifthey could not be removed.      The artillery whichhad been due to be landed the previous evening hadbeen sent backcIn reply to a question by the First Lordof the Admiralty,  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARsaid that every effort would be made to remove the wounded, but unfortunately the Field AmbulanceSection had been torpedoed^THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS thought that when the evacuation was madepublie,the press and public opinion would demand that two questions should be answered:-(i)    &quot;Why have we had to evacuate?&quot;On this question the Press had beenhelpful in the last few days;    andpublic opinion was more or less preparedfor the news of withdrawal.

Statement to &quot;bemade to theLeaders of theOpposition and toParliament.(ii)    &quot;How was it that we got into this position, and why did we not realisewhat was likely to happen?&quot;Public opinion was entirely unpreparedon this question and would certainly be extremely critical.Would it be possible to do anything to prepare publicopinion on this second point, without endangering the lives of the troops to be evacuated?THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that the questionof timing would be extremely difficult.    Clearly wecould do nothing until the withdrawal had been successfully accomplished, whereas the moment   evacuationbegan it was likely that the Cermans would broadcastthe most alarming account.There was general agreement that, if the Presswere to go further than they had at present, anything which they-could say would point to the inevitability of evacuation and would thereby increase the dangersattendant on that operation;    it was undesirabletherefore, that any further lead on this subject shouldbe given to the Press at this present time.Discussion followed as to when the operations in Norway should be debated in Parliament.     The viewgenerally expressed was that it would be out of thequestion to have a debate so early as, Tuesday 30thApril.    Probably the earliest date on which the matter could be debated would be Thursday, 2nd May;    or possibly even the beginning of the ensuing week.There was general agreement that the PrimeMinister should inform the Leaders of the Opposition(who had been kept fully informed of the way in which thesituation had developed) that as soon as the withdrawalhad been effected a full opportunity would be given forthe whole question to be debated either publicly or in secret Session^    but that,  in view of the uncertaintiesof the situation, he could not commit himself as to theday on which such a debate could take place. The debate.-4-t

could only take place when   &apos;:he position--could, he..discussed without imperilling military operations.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was muchencouraged by the view expressed during this part ofthe discussion;    in his communication to the Leadersof the Opposition he would take the line indicated.General Paget1s The Prime Minister said that a telegramviews.had been received from General Paget which stated thathe had just received a copy of the message fromBrigadier Hogg recommending withdrawal and statingthat Brigadier Hogg had not consulted him before itsdespatch, and that he (General Hogg) was not entitledto appreciate the situation other than from the base.General Paget had added that he did not agree thatthe situation on his front necessitated evacuation,provided more effective action could be taken to dealwith enemy aircraft, which at present operated with little hindrance and were systematically destroying the base and communications.The Prime Minister said that a telegram had also been received from Norwegian Headquarters sayingthat the troops were in good heart but in urgent need of artillery support, of which at present they had none.The telegram added that General Rouge had withdrawnall Norwegian troops from his front for rest andre-organisation, except a ski detachment.      GeneralRouge daily demanded to know when he might expectfurther armed support.GENERAL MASSY, who entered the War cabinet at this point, said that the number of personnel nowashore whom he was making arrangements to withdrawamounted to 5,200.     This number included Royal MarineIand Royal Air Force personnel.      Separate arrangements were being made for the evacuation of the King of Norway

and the British and French Diplomatic Staffs.General Massy said that he doubted whethermany Norwegian troops would take advantage of ourevacuation facilities for they were drifting awayso quickly that there would not be many left in thearea.     General Massy added that the NorwegianCommander-in-Chief had been unduly optimistic inall the statements he had issued, and had made reference to formations that did not, in fact,exist.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
