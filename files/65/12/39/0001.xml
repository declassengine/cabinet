THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST    SECRET.COPY NO.W.M.(40) 108TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(30th April,  1940.)OPERATIONS in norway.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 107thConclusions,Minute 3.)Possiblelanding groundsin the Narvikarea.Narvik..landing grounds southof Narvik.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that hehad received reports regarding two possible landing grounds for our Fighter aircraft in the Narvik area,one at Bardu, the other at Ovrevatnet, near Salangen.One squadron of Blenheims and two squadrons ofHurricanes were in readiness to proceed to theselanding grounds at very short notice.     experience had shown, however, that it would be a mistake tosend the aircraft until anti-aircraft guns had beeninstalled in sufficient strength.     The matter wasvery urgent.    If we did not establish aerodromes inthe Narvik area within the next few days, the germans would be grotty o or tain to do s-mTHE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatall preparations were being made to establish a proper base at Narvik with large numbers of anti-aircraft guns, a proportion of which were already en route to Narvik.     The next week, before the anti-aircraft defences were complete, would be a critical period.       The Chiefs of Staff had arranged to receive a daily progress report on these preparations.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was an onlyless urgent matter to reconnoitre for suitable landing grounds in the areas to the south of Narvik.

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said thatreconnaissances were in fact taking place at Bodo,Mo and Mosjoen. and other parts of this area,The War Cabinet took note of these statements, and asked thatreconnaissance for, and preparation and protection of, suitable air bases in this area might be treated as amatter of the highest urgency.Withdrawal THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that from Namsos.General Carton de Wiart had reported that it was notpossible for his force to fall back from Namsos toMosjoen by road owing to lack of petrol and transport,and the bad condition of the roads.     He had suggestedthat a battalion of Chasseurs Alpins might be sent toMosjoen by destroyer.     The British troops could notbe sent, as they were acting as rearguard.     The WarOffice had telegraphed to General Carton de Wiart tosay that General Gamelin insisted on the need forfighting a delaying action up the road to Mosjoen, andthat the French troops should therefore be used forthis purpose.     Up till now the Chasseurs Alpins namsos had taken no part in the fighting at all.      Thefirst of the small independent forces which were to beput in at the lesser fjords, was intended to land atMo, but this of course was to the north of Mosjoen.Some discussion followed on the provision of anti-aircraft defences at Mosjoen before any numbers oftroops were landed.     H.M.S. JANUS was taking a smallparty to the port, and it was intended that the anti-aircraft guns now at Namsos should be put intoMosjoen as soon as the evacuation of Namsos had beencompleted and the guns could be withdrawn.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY urged thegreat importance of sending a few guns to Mosjoen earlier than this..   All our experience showed the vitalimportance of getting the anti-aircraft defences ashorefirst of all.    If the Army would provide guns, theWavy would undertake to transport them to Mosjoen and keep them supplied.It was agreed that this matter shouldhe taken up at once between the Generaland Naval Staffs.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that owing to interruption of communications on accountof bombing, a misunderstanding had occurredbetween the naval and military authorities atAndalsnes.      The latter had expected the evacuationto begin at midnight during the night 29th-30th April.Evacuation in this area was timed to begin during the night 30th April-lst May.    Four cruisers and three destroyers would be engaged in the evacuation.    the bombardment of the Trondhjem forts was due to begin on the 1st May.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thata telegram had been received during the night fromGeneral Paget, stating that he had explained theevacuation plan to the Norwegian Commander-in-chief.The latter had stated that he was prepared to advise his Government to continue the war providedthere was further hope of Allied intervention in norway in the near future. Failing this, he

would advise surrender.     An immediate reply hadbeen sent by the War Office stating that the Allieswere firmly resolved to continue their support;that their strategic withdrawal in no way weakenedtheir determination to continue the war in northern norway and to maintain the struggle until it was brought to a successful issue;    and that success wasdoubly assured if the Allies had full Norwegianco-operation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had seen the Norwegian Minister on theprevious day and had outlined the plan for withdrawal.The Minister&apos;s reaction had been very good.     He hadnaturally been most distressed, but had admitted that sentiment must give way before hard facts.   Hehad expressed the hope, however, that the Allies wouldnot treat Norway as a secondary consideration.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he had done his best to reassure M. Colbanon very much the same lines as the telegram which hadbeen sent by the War Office.The Press and Some discussion followed on the preparationpublic opinion.of public opinion for the forthcoming withdrawal fromTrondhjem.     It was generally agreed that it would bewell to emphasise the unsoundness, from the strategicalpoint of view, of allowing ourselves to be comnittedtothe maintenance of a large force in the Trondhjem area,since this would have put an extremely heavy strainupon our naval forces..     The same considerations didnot apply in the case of Narvik,  since it was verymuch more distant from the German bases..  THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Ministryof Information had been steadily preparing the Press-r4rr

Richmond Terrace, S.W.during the last few days, and the results soachieved seemed very satisfactory.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had seen the Leaders of the Opposition,  and they had made nocriticism of the Government&apos;s action.     No difficultyneed he anticipated in the House of Commons.      TheOpposition Leaders had however asked why it had beenpossible for the Germans to   take  their transports and supply ships across to Oslo without more interferenceby our naval forces.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs drew attention to a report, which had appeared in the daily Telegraph, of a German broadcast purporting togive an account of the discussion at the last Meetingof the Supreme War,Council.   The Council were said tohave reached the conclusion that the Allies had only two alternatives, either to evacuate Norway or tosend in very much larger forces.      They had decided on the latter course, and in consonance with thisdecision a large-scale combined attack on Trondhjemwas to be carried out.     A report from Amsterdam wasin much the same strain, but it had added that wewere trying to spread rumours of an intended evacuationin order to put the Germans off their guard.      it seemed from these reports that we had had some success in mystifying the enemy as to our intentions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements..
