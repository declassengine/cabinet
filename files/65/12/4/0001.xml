THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 7*        ^It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.- MOST SECRET -COPY Mo./7W.M. (40) 59th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.(4th March, 1940.)ASSISTANCETO FINLAND.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 58thConclusions,Minute 4.)Latest Inform-ation from finland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs drew attention to the following telegrams which hadbeen received since the question of assistance to finland had last been considered by the War Cabinet s-Telegram No. 168, dated Snd March, 1940,from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Helsinki, inwhich Mr Vereker reported that the Finnishi        Government were now consulting marshal mannerheim both in regard, to making anappeal to the Allies and in regard tothe Soviet peace terms .Telegram. No. 170, dated 4th March, 1940,from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Helsinki,reporting an interview with the FinnishPrime Minister at which the Minister forForeign Affairs had also been present.At this interview Mr Vereker had explainedclearly the scale on which we were preparedto give assistance to Finland.   During the interview the Finnish Foreign Minister hadbeen querulous, not to say defeatist, inattitude.   The Finnish Prime Minister haddrown particular attention to the fact thatas yet the Finnish Government had made no formal appeal to the Swedish and Norwegian Governments,   Ho had laid the greateststress upon the immediate despatch by usto Finland of 100 bombers.Mr Vereker had formed the opinion thatthe Finnish Government might be trying toget the best of both worlds;   on the onehand gaining time in their negotiationswith the TT.S.S.R., and on the other handawaiting the reaction of the Swedish and norwegian Governments to the demarphewhich we had addressed to them before they(the Finnish Government) reached a finaldecision.

In reply to a question by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the Secretary of State agreed that itwas nor- clear that there ^as no foundation for thevie:; expressed by M. Daladicr that the communication which he had received from the Finnish Prime Minister,through the Finnish Minister in Paris, could beregarded as constituting the Finnish appeal for help which wc had been awaiting.Continuing his explanation of the information which had been received since the last Meeting of the.l*ar Cabinet, the Foreign Secretary said that thisincludedTelegram. No. 97 DIPP and tele gran No. 99DIPP, dated 2nd and 3rd March, 1940,respectively, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister,Stockholm, which made it clear that theSv-edish Government&apos;s reaction to oursuggestions was what we had expectod.Mr Mallet, telegraphing on Saturday,2nd March,1940, reported that he had seen the Swedish Minister for Foreign affairs that day.   The Foreign Minister had made it clear that the Swedish Government wouldnot consent to the passage of foreign troopsacross Sweden.   He seeded faintly surprisedthat we should even imagine that there was any hope of their returning an affirmativereply to this, suggestion.Mr Mallet had had an interview on the evening of Sunday, 3rd March, 1940, withM. Bohenann, the Secretary-General of theSwedish Foreign Office, in which the latter had stated officially that the swedish government were not prepared to permit thepassage of foreign troops across Sweden;nor were they willing to enter into staff conversations with us.   M. Bohemann had said that on these subjects he had nothing to add. to what had been said to Mr Malletby the Foreign Minister the previous day.He had said that, during the previous week,the Finnish Government had been on thepoint of agreeing to a not unreasonableRussian offer, but that they had changedtheir minds at the last moment.In addition, Sir Alexander Cadogan, Permanent TJndcr-Socrctary, Foreign Office, had on the previous day had an interview with M. C orb in, the French Ambassador,which might bo sutriarised as follows:-

M. Corbin had come straight from an inter-view with M. Gripcribcrg, who had said thatthe Finnish Government were in a state of doubt and uncertainty.   To this Sir AlexanderOadogan had replied that this was perhapspartly due to their having been givendifferent replies in London and Parisrespectively.   For technical reasons connected with transit, etc., it was quiteout of the question for the Allies to send50,000 troops to Finland before the end ofMarch.   M. Corbin had agreed that theFinnish Government had no doubt misunderstoodthe position in this matter, but he urgedthat the vital question was now whether we could supply bombers to Finland.     TheFrench Government had agreed to send first10 and then IS bombers, and now proposed tosend 18.   Sir Alexander Cadogan had repliedthat considerable numbers of British aircraft were already on their way to Finland, and,in view of the difficulties in regard toground equipment in Finland, we felt that,thc best course was to expedite the transitof the aircraft we were already sending.To this M. Corbin had said that there was a real danger that the Finnish Government might come to terms with the U.S.S.R,, and thatthe despatch of the bombers as proposedmight be the one gesture necessary to persuade them to hold firm.   Sir alexander cadogan had then said that, while this might bo true, it would be both wastefuland misleading to despatch bombers if theycould not be used effectively and at theright time.   M. Corbin had insisted, however,that the question whether or not wedespatched those bombers might be the decisive factor.   He referred also to theaircraft which France had already sent(30 Moranc and 84 Caudron aircraft, apartfrom 46 Dutch pianos which had also been promised) .   He went on to say that the forceof 12,000 men would be entirely French, andthat there would be no British contingent,nor would there, as originally planned, beany Polish contingent.   Sir Alexander Cadoganhad expressed surprise at this statement,saying that he thought the Ambassador mustbe mistaken.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was quite clearthat the French Ambassador was   misinformed on thesubject of the military contingent which we proposedto send.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed that this was so, and said that he would clear up the question with the Ambassador.   During the

InterviewbetweenSir A.Cadoganand M. Gripen-berg .Command ofAllied Forcesin Finland.previous afternoon Sir Alexander Cadogan had had an interview with m. Gripcriborg, the Finnish Minister,which might be summarised as followsm. Gripenberg had at once raised the questionof the despatch of bombers;   the speed-up ofthe transit of the aircraft we were alreadysending was not meeting the case, since thesedid not include heavy bombers, which were whatwas needed by the Finnish Army for counter-battery work.&apos; Moreover, he had been in touchwith the Air Ministry, who did not appear tobe aware of the decision that the despatchand transit of aircraft already promisedshould bo expedited.   Marshal Manncrheim had expressed the view that the heavy bombers were a vital necessity, and he would not havedone so unless he had been convinced.   He(mC Gripenberg) understood the difficulties about the ground equipment in Finland, butthere were enough bombs in Finland already,and would it not be possible, therefore, forus to send out by air the necessary groundpersonnel?   M. Gripenberg had concluded by saying that the sincerity of our desire tohelp Finland would be judged by the material which we now sent her.   Sir Alexander Cadoganhad replied that we would do everything possible to expedite the arrival of theaircraft already promised;   as regards thedespatch of heavy bombers, he could onlypromise that the question should be submittedonce more to the War Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary said that it was against this background that he wished the War Cabinet to-consider a number of questions.   The first of these,which the Finnish Minister had put to him, was whether our forces in Finland would bo prepared to serve underthe orders of Marshal Manncrheim.   He had explained toMo Gripenberg the difficulty that if our forces served in the southern part of Finland &quot;they would be dependentupon a very long line of communication, which might be cut by a German landing at the head of the Gulf ofBothnia;   but it was clear that M. Gripenberg felt thatthe same argument might be applied to the main FinnishArmy, which would be equally vulnerable to an attack in the rear by the Germans.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that it had &quot;been agreed with General Gamelinthat the Allied forces in Finland would not operate south of the &quot;waistline&quot;, owing to the vulnerability of their line of communication.    Ifthey were placed under the direct command ofMarshal Mannerheim he might order our forces to southern Finland.   Naturally the action of our forces would he closely co-ordinated with that ofthe main Finnish Army, and, subject to the agreementof the French and to an understanding that theywould not be ordered to move down into southernFinland, there would seem to be no objection totheir operating under the general direction ofMarshal Mannerheim.    If we were able to build upin Finland considerable reserves of stores and supplies, it might later be possible for the allied forces to operate further to the south, at least for a limited period.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that theFinnish Army was clearly in a different position from the Allied forces, since the former drew their supplies from Finland itself whereas we were entirely dependent on a long and vulnerable lineof communication,THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff undertook to make clear to General Enckell thereasons why it would not be practicable for theAllied forces to operate south of the &quot;waistline&quot;.He would also take txp with the French the questionof the supreme command in Finland,

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that M, Gripenberg had again pressed for additional aircraft, to be maintained by the groundorganisation already available in Finland,    The factthat the Finns were anxious to obtain additional aircraft which they knew would take a long time toarrive, seemed to indicate that they had no immediateintention of making terms with the Russians.   Forthis reason he felt disposed to let the Finns havea few more aircraft,THE PRIME MINISTER said that during thenext 24 hours we should probably know whether the finns were going to make their appeal or not.    Ifthey did, and asked for    Allied forces to help them,it would mean that they had every intention of holding out, and it would be to our interest to help them to resist by any means in our power.    If,however, they made no appeal and showed signs of negotiating with the Russians, it would clearly beabsurd to send them any more bombers.   On the otherhand it was conceivable that they might restrict theirappeal to a request for additional material only,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY was not infavour of frittering away our bomber force.   Hitlershowed no signs of a move towards peace, and we mightwell be engaged in operations on a large scale in themain theatre of war within a short time,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR supported this view.In further discussion it was generally agreed that the question of supplying additional.

Further approach to scandinavian government,,aircraft must depend on whether the Finns made anappeal, and on the reactions of Norway and sweden to such an appeal,The discussion then turned on the nextmove to he made with regard to the scandinavian countries and whether we should ask them what action they would take if we sent our expedition inspite of their protests, and what more they wereprepared to do to help the Finns.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs pointed out that unless the Finns made an appeal for Allied forces, it would he impossible to justifythe despatch of our expedition.    If the Finns didappeal for this form of assistance, he suggestedthat we should threaten the Swedes with making knownpublicly their refusal to cooperate,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALY thought fhn*it was doubtful whether the Finns would make anappeal for Allied troops.    They might feel that ifthey got on the wrong side of Sweden, they would lose the considerable assistance they were alreadyreceiving from them,without a corresponding advantageIt was possible that they were hoping   that germany would see to it that Finland was not completelyoverrun by Russia,    In  his view there would be noquestion of publishing the Swedish reply to ourdemarche unless the Finns made an appeal for allied troops.   The Swedes could make a case, showing us inanunfavourable light, by pointing out that we were only intending to send a small force to Finlandwhich could not arrive till April, and by saying thatwe were using assistance to Finland merely as a pretext for seizing control of the northern  Swedishorefields.

It was generally agreed that no further action could he taken unless and until the Finnsmade their appeal for  .Allied troops,   it wouldhe desirable, however, to keep the President of theUnited States informed of the attitude we were taking in this matter.Some discussion then ensued on thepossibility of a limited operation through Narvikalone.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF explained thatall our plans so far had been based on the assumption,that we should have the cooperation of Norway and sweden,    The forces to be sent to souther Swedenhad always been looked upon as the price which weshould probably have to pay to secure this co-operation,   If there was any idea of carrying out an operation through Narvik alone, possibly againstlimited resistance, a new situation would arise,and the Chiefs of Staff would have to consider thematter afresh.    The Joint Planning Committee were already examining the Implications of such a situation.THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether itwould be possible for us to send the Allied forces to finland through Trondhjem without using the port, o*Narvik at all.    It was conceivable that such an offer might be slightly more acceptable to the Swedes.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that this proposal would have to be examined,Subject to such examination, he thought it would bepossible to use Trondhjem alone.    It would take longer to send troops through, however, if we had not the useof Narvik, and there was the additional disadvantagethat Trondhjera was liable to   heavy air attack fromGermanye

Possibility of inducing Swedenio restrict herIxports of orefo Germany.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY emphasised that when the ice broke in the Baltic, Germany wouldhave the whole of Scandinavia virtually in her powerIf she required to put further pressure on the Swedeto produce more iron ore, she could do this merely by the threat of her armed forces without sendingtroops at all.     She might well offer to act as amediator between Finland and Russia, and guarantee to Finland that Russia would obtain nothing morethan a few small pieces of territory in the southof Finland.     No doubt, however, one of theconditions of peace would be the demob ili satof the Finnish Army, and the whole of Finland wouldthen be defenceless against German threats.     Itwould be no use hoping that we should be able to useFinland as a means of access to the Baltic.The possibility was then discussed of bringing further pressure to bear on Sweden to restrict her ore exports to Germany in the event ofthe whole Scandinavian project having to be calledoff.     It was suggested that we might possibly do this through our War Trade Agreement, and it was recalled that in 1917-18 we had reduced the scandinavian countries almost to the edge ofstarvation by this means in order to make themcomply with our requirements.     The export of orethrough Lulea might also be reduced by sabotage.The War Cabinet:-(i)   Agreed that, subject to theconcurrence of the French, theproposed Franco-British contingentin Finland might be placed underthe general direction of marshal mannerheim, provided that it wasnot required to operate south ofa line drawn east and west throughthe head of the Gulf of Bothnia.The British Commander would ofcourse at all times retain the tactical direction of the allied force.- 9 -

(ii)   Invited the Chief of the ImoerialGeneral Staff -(iii)   Agreed that until the finnish government made it clear whethi.-.they intended to appeal to theAllies for armed assistance -(a) A decision should hedeferred on the despatchof additional aircraft to finland:(b) No further approach shouldhe made to the norwegian and Swedish Governments.(iv)   Agreed provisionally that, if th,Finns made this appeal, we should immediately aslc the norwegian and Swedish Governments -(a)   What they would do if,despite their protests,, wesent an expedition toScandinaviat(b)   What they themselvesproposed to do in response to the Finnish appeal.(v)   Invited the Foreign Secretary tokeep the President of the UnitedStates informed as to what wedoing in this matter,.(a)To see General Ended and explain the reasons for tlabove limitation on theemployment of the Alliedcontingent;To obtain the concurrence of the French to theproposal in Conclusion (ijabove, through Serviceliaison channels,,fence&apos;M imMemorandum by war Cabinet had before them athe Chiefs of Staff on assurances tobe given to the Scandinavian countriesregardingair attack in the event of tbei,r co-operation with us involving them in hostilities with Germany(W0P0 (40) 83).

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF recalled that      athis question had been raised in the Chiefs of staff report on the Implications of Intervention in scandinavia (W.P. (40) 35) 9 in which they had pointedout that we could only give indirect assistance to scandinavia against this form of attack, by ourselvesattacking objectives in Germany.     Referring to paragraph 5 (i) of the Memorandum, he said that on further consideration the Chiefs of Staff would prefer to have this worded as followss-&quot;If the Scandinavian Governments so demand,should we give them an assurance that if germany &quot;took the gloves off&quot; and initiatedbombing in Scandinavia that led to destructionof civilian life and property, as she did in poland, we should immediately retaliate on germany? &quot;We could hardly be expected to consider air attack onTrondhjem, for example, as the equivalent of air attack on London,     If we did, it would mean that weshould have to start bombing Berlin, and this would almost certainly lead to retaliation against Londonitself.   NatureCUy we should not give any assurance ofthe nature contemplated in the Memorandum usless theScandinavians demanded it as part of the price fortheir co-operation.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that the Swedescould not make such a demand unless they wereprepared to come in with us as allies.     At present,this possibility seemed very remote, and he suggestedthat a decision on the matter should be deferred untilthe contingency actually arose.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that there were many other questions of a similar hypothetical naturewhich might arise.     Several had been brought to notice at an inter-departmental meeting which he had

summoned on Friday, at the Prime Minister&apos;s request,to discuss the arrangements for the Delegation whichwas to be sent to. Norway and Sweden if thesecountries showed themselves prepared to co-operate with us.     It was not possible to decide thesematters until we knew exactly what the Scandinaviandemands would be.The War Cabinet agreed:-(i)   To defer a decision on the questionscontained in the Memorandum. under consideration (W.P. (40) 83)until a demand for assurances onthe lines suggested was actuallyput forward by the scandinavian countries:(ii)   Thats if and when such a demand was received from the scandinavian countries, the French should immediately be consulted, andtheir agreement obtained to theterms of any assurances that mightbe given.Richmond.Terrace, S.W*1.
