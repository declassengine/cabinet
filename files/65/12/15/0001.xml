MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(3rd April, 1940).SUPREME WARCOUNCILoRoyal marine operation.proposed operation inNorv/egianTerritorial7/aters.(previous references.Mc(40) 79thConclusions,Minute 4).THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR WAR said thata somewhat garbled report had been received at theWar Office that the Germans had been collecting astrong force of troops at Rostock with the avowedintention of taking action in Scandinavia, ifnecessary.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that Foreign Office Telegram No. 145   from Stockholm tended to confirm this report.     This stated,on the authority of the Swedish Legation in Berlin,that some 200,000 tons of German shipping were nowifconcentrated at Stettin and Swinemunde with troops on board, which rumour placed at 400,000.       It was believed that this force was in readiness to delivera counter--stroke against a possible attack by us uponNarvik or other Norwegian ports, about which the germans were said to be still nervous^     The Swedish authoritiesdid not believe that the GeimanB   would land this force in Norway or Sweden if we were merely to make useof Norwegian Territorial Waters or to stop ore ship-ments, but thought the Germans would retaliate ratherby tit-for-tat methodSe

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY hoped that whatever the decision of the French Government inregard to the Royal Marine Operation, we should proceed with the laying of mines in norwegian territorial Waters as arranged on 5th April.     Allthe necessary arrangements had been made for the landing operation, should this prove necessary, huthe personally doubted whether the Germans would landa force in Scandinavia.     It must be realised that itwas very difficult to hold the Operation in suspense.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that,according to present plans, some of the troops would go on board cruisers on 5th April, but it would not be possible to keep them there for long.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that it had originally been proposed that the warning should be given to the Scandinavian governments on Monday, 1st April, and that the Operation shouldbe carried out on 5th April.       He had alwaysanticipated that if there were to be a delay in regardto the warning, there would be a corresponding post-ponement of the date of the &quot;actual Operation.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought thatthe warning given by the Prime Minister in his speechthe previous day might justify some reduction in the interval between the communication to the scandinavian government and the carrying out of the Operation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that inview of the meeting of the French Senate on Tuesday,9th April, it was essential that action should betaken before that date, since otherwise the FrenchGovernment would fall.

THE FIRST LORD OF TEE ADMIRALTY suggestedthat the operation in Norwegian Territorial Watersmight he postponed from 5th to 7th April.      If M.Reynaud agreed to the Prime Minister sending a communication to M. Daladier, it would still &quot;bepossible to get his reply before the time at which weshould need to warn the Scandinavian Governments,provided that the necessary instructions were givenin advance to our representatives in Oslo andStockholm.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, assuming a reply was received from M. Daladier by Friday, the5th April, and that the reply was favourable, thetwo Operations would go forward together as planned.If, however, the reply was unfavourable, we shouldhave to abandon the Royal Marine Operation for thetime being,and proceed with the Norwegian territorial waters Operation alone. Matters had now gone too far for us not to take action.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed,  -but   doubted whether we should secure muchpractical advantage from the proposed Operation, if carried out apart from the Royal Marine Operation.   Itmust be anticipated also that the Germans would put the utmost pressure on the Norwegians, for example, to deny to us the use of their tankers.THE PRIME MINISTER said 1hat he was prepared to face such a contingency.

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER recalled that the Norwegian Territorial Waters Operation hadbeen planned as an Allied Operation, and suggestedthat if we were now to take up with the Frenchthe question of the dispositions of the French naval units- proposed to be employed, we should therebyweaken our pressure on the French Government to agreealso to the Royal Marine Operation.THE FIRST LORD said that it was for thisreason that he had not put pressure on the french to make available the destroyers they had promisedfor the Territorial Waters Operation.   If the NarvikOperation was carried out, the destroyers would be needed to convoy the transports0THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he would prefer that the 8th April should befixed as the date for carrying out the territorial waters Operation.    He added that he hoped that this operation would not be justified on the ground ofScandinavian complacence to German demands, but ratherupon the illegal actions of Germany herself.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, and said that itwas for this reason that he had employed thephraseology adopted in his statement in Parliament theprevious day.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that information had been received from Rear-AdmiralFitzgerald in France that the Germans had blown upone of the bridges on the Rhine on the 31st March,A report from secret sources alleged that the germans had been laying a net across the Rhine.    This suggestedthat news of the proposed operation had leaked through to

Germany, which was disturbing.    He was confident,however, that there was nothing which the germans could do to prevent the success of the operation,if it were launched in the near future.The War Cabinet agreed:&apos;&quot;(a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should instructHis Majesty1s Ambassador, Paris,to ascertain at once from M. Reynaudwhether he had any objection tothe Prime Minister addressing a personal communication to M.Daladierurging him to withdraw hisopposition to the Royal marine operation;(b) That if M. Reynaud concurred, thePrime Minister should the same dayaddress a- letter to M. Daladier inthat sense;(c) That if a favourable reply wasreceived from France, arrangements should be made to carry out theRoyal Marine Operation as soon aspossible.    Failing a favourablereply, the Royal Marine operation should be abandoned for the timebeing.(d) That, irrespective  of the replyreceived from France   in regardto the royal Marine Operation, thetime table for the norwegian territorial Waters Operation shouldbe as followsAction to be taken at once;   The:Eexts of the communications to bemade to the norwegian and Swedish governments to be despatched toHis Majesty1sRepresentatives at Osloand Stockholm undersuspended instructions;Friday. 5th April, Telegraphic1940.       instructions to beissued to His Majesty&apos;representatives, Osloand Stockholm, to hand tothe Norwegian and swedish governments   the warningas set out in thesuspended instructions;Monday. 8th April,   Laying of Mines1940.       in Norwegian territorial waters.

The damage she hadsustained had opened the eyes of the GermanNavy to the extremely powerful nature of theexplosives now used by the British Navy.The LEIPZIG had been torpedoed; she hadnot been sunk, but a large part of her crewhad been killed,,The KARLSRUHE had been torpedoed and sunkwith the loss of all hands.As regards submarines, of one batch of fifteen which had been sent out, only one hadreturnedj and of two submarines sent out fortrials, neither had returned.   The Germans were now experiencing great difficulties in obtainingcrews for submarines, only fanatical Nazi youthsbeing willing to volunteer.Great discontent existed also in Hamburgand the neighbourhood owing to the shortage offood and the bad quality of that available.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
