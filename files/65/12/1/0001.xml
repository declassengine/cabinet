&apos; THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET-copy No. (9W.M. (40) 56th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annexe(1st March,l940.)ASSISTANCE to finland.(previous references.M.(40) 55thConclusions,Minute 6.)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the position in Helsinki seemed to be somewhatconfused.   He had seen the Finnish Minister thatmornings   The Finnish Government professed to be insome doubt as to the date on which, under the planproposed, our help could reach Finland.   They seemedto think that the force we were preparing could not reach Finland until the end of April, which, intheir view, was too late.   M. Gripenberg had,however, telephoned to the Finnish Government to let them know that, according to our plan, ourcontingent would arrive earlier than they expected.The Finnish Government also professed themselvessomewhat disappointed as to the extent of ourpromised assistance.The Finnish Government knew that the questionwhether we could send help depended on Sweden&apos;attitude, and that Sweden had refused to agree totroops passing through her country.   M. Griperiberghad also informed him that the Finnish Governmenthad to decide today whether they would negotiate with the Soviet TTnion*The Finnish Government were now aware of our plan, subject to the exception that they were not aware of the extent of the help which we proposed tooffer to Sweden,

As regards the Swedish Government, we had notourselves as yet communicated the plan to them, but itwas possible that they had heard of it in part fromM. Tanner.-    We had hitherto deliberately abstained from telling our plan to the Swedes, but the foreign secretary thought that the time had now come when weshould address our appeal to them to allow troops topass through.-THE PRIME MINISTER said that the French alsowished to tell the Finns that some part of the forces which we were preparing to send to Sweden could, ifnecessary, be made available to fight in Finland-   Hehad explained to M. Corbin that the extent of the forces which we could send to Finland depended, in part at anyrate, on communications.It was agreed that it would be necessary tosafeguard ourselves in any statement which we made tothe Finnish Government on the diversion to Finland of forces destined for Sweden.     Our answer might be that,if Sweden agreed to our passing droops through hercountry to help Finland, we should be prepared to helpFinland and Sweden to the limit of our powers.THE PRIME MINISTER said that M. Corbin, whohad just left him, had said that M. Daladier felt thathe could not maintain his position if effective steps were not taken to help Finland.     He (the PrimeMinister) had replied that if Finland did not appealto us for help, then M. Daladier could not be attacked on this matter.     M. Corbin had replied that the Finnsmight take the line that they had not appealed to usbecause they knew we were not willing or able to send them effective help.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY raised thequestion of what action we should take if the Swedesdid not agree to our sending troops through theircountry.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the whole plan had always been dependent on our obtaining at least the acquiescence of the Swedes.     If they refused to let us pass, they must take the blame before worldopinionsTHE FIRST LORD referred to the possibility that by the end of April, when the ice broke, germany might send forces up the Gulf of Bothnia.     Finlandcould then be taken in the rear and overwhelmed, andGermany, in collusion with Russia, could entirely cut usout of Northern Scandinavia.     This would be a heavyreverse for us.It was pointed out that if Sweden refusedto allow us to send troops to Finland and it wasimpossible for us to help Finland effectively, theFinnish Government would probably make peace with soviet Russia.     In that event if was difficult to see what excuse or motive Germany would have for moving upthe Gulf of Bothnia.The First Lord thought that Germany wouldcertainly take control of this area within the next twomonths.     In his view our action should not be deter-mined entirely by Sweden&apos;s attitude.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the following courses were open to us:-(i)   We might issue an ultimatum to Norway and sweden, and say that if we were not givenpermission to send troops through their countries, we should force our way through.

(il)   We might make a strong request forpassage, and back this up by arrivingoff Narvik with the expedition,(iii)   We might say that we proposed to sendthrough strong forces of volunteers, whowould go in unarmed, to be followed at ashort interval by arms and munitions.(iv) We might conceivably, if troops were not allowed to pass through, send to Finlandthe material which the troops would haveused.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that he favoured the second course, which was that suggestedby General Smuts.     We should arrive off Narvik withour force and demand passage.       In that event he didnot think the Norwegians would fire on our troops.If was possible, of course, that when our expeditionarrived off Narvik, the Norwegians would adopt so strong and menacing an attitude that we should have toreturn without landing.     He would not, however, regard this as too humiliating a rebuff.     It would make itclear that we were determined on action, that we had done all we could, had behaved honourably, and had onlywithdrawn because to force a passage would involve therisk of serious hostilities with the Norwegians*     Atthe same time, he would not entirely exclude, at thisstage, the use of some force in order to make our way through.Reference was made to Article XVI of theCovenant of the League of Nations.     It was pointed outthat the broad effect of this Article was to leave itto the countries concerned to settle what action theyshould take thereunder.     It had been made clear thatif we were to attempt to use this Article to demand aright of passage through the Scandinavian countries,they would probably leave the League.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO expressed thehope that, if, as he anticipated, the scandinavian government would not agree to the passage of allied forces to Finland, we should give most serious consideration to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s fourthsuggestion. __

Sietaorad Terraces SoW.l.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out thatif  an opposed   landing was contemplated, it would be necessary  to re-organise the expedition.     If we had toencounter even relatively mild opposition from the swedes, it would he impossible for our forces to reachFinland in time to render effective help, or for us toreach the Galivare ore-fields before a German force could get there.It was agreed that the immediate point was toinform the Norwegian and Swedish Governments that wehad prepared forces to assist Finland, and to supportSweden and Norway in the event of their attitude leading to German aggression against them.The War Cabinet:-Authorised the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to instruct our ministers at Stockholm and Oslo to make immediatecommunications to the Swedish and norwegian Governments as follows :-An Allied force had been prepared for despatch to Finland through Norway and sweden.     Preparations for this force werenearing completion.     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment appealed to the Governments of norway and Sweden to give the active co-operation essential for the success ofthe scheme.     Should this co-operationinvolve Norway and Sweden in hostilities with Germany, the Allied Governments were willing to afford extensive military assistance to Norway and Sweden, and wereactively preparing to do so*     The scale of assistance could not, however, bedetermined without Staff Conversations,but the Allied governments were preparedto send fully qualified Missions forthwith.
