(40)  6Qth CONCLUSIONST MINUTE 6,Confidential Annex.(5th March, 1940.)ASSISTANCETO FINLAND.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 59thConclusions,Minute 6.)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that theWar Office had made an Appreciation of the situationin Finland which led to the conclusion that things were by no means desperate.   He had, however, just received a telegram from the new Military Attache&quot;who had just arrived in Finland, and had seen MarshalMannerheim9 which showed that the Marshal took agloomy view of affairs, and was particularly anxious for us to send 100 bombers immediately.(A copy of this telegram, which was read out tothe War Cabinet by the Secretary of State for War, isattached. )On the other hand, General Ling, who had just returned, and had seen the Finnish Minister in stockholm on Friday last, gave a different picture of the situation, and thought that there was no immediate anxiety.   Viborg had held out longer than expected, and this would give the Finns additionaltime in which to prepare their next line.   He thought they would be able to hold out until the thaw came,though perhaps with some difficulty, in which casetheir resistance might well continue until July.The reason the Finns wore so insistent on theneed for bombing aircraft was that the Russians hadmassed enormous numbers in the Karelian Isthmus,

which was choked with personnel and stores.   The effects of a bombing attack would therefore be very great; butthe Finns did not at present possess sufficient strength of bombers to penetrate the defence.   BrigadierLing thought that at least three squadrons of heavy bombers would be required to make an impression.In the subsequent discussion, it was argued that marshall Mannerhcim had probably been instructed by hisGovernment to exaggerate the gravity of the situation,so as to reinforce their requests for assistance on alarge scale.   The Finnish Government were hesitatingwhether to accept the Russian terms, or to appeal forour assistance.   Before deciding, they were trying tosqueeze out of us as much as they could.   This being so, we would be unwise to promise any more material to the Finns unless they first issued their appeal inthe manner which we had suggested.The Finns had already been told that, if we came to their assistance as a result of this appeal, wewould do so with all the means in our power.    If, onthe other hand, they die1 not appeal to us, it wouldmean that they wore about to submit to the Russianterms;    in which case anything wc might now send tothem would come too lato.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEthought, it was very important to keep the Russiansfighting.   The Germans seemed anxious to bring theFinnish war to an end, and must have very good reasonsfor this .   They were probably alarmed at the extent towhich the Russian resources were being exhausted, and the delays which would in consequence take place indeliveries of goods to Germany.   They also realised that, as long as the war went on, Russia would be

unable to co-operate with then in the Middle East.If this point of view were correct, it would be worthour while to treat the Finnish front as one of our own,and send the 100 bombers asked for.   But if v.re did notsend substantial help, it was probably not worth send-ing anything.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY and THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR deprecated sendingfurther aircraft to Finland, since we should therebyweaken ourselves against Germany.   The Finnish warcould not be regarded as a profitable diversion, sinceGerman forces were not engaged.There was general agreement that no further action was possible, and that no further materialcould be promised to the Finns, until it was known whether they were going to make their appeal.   Whenthe appeal vas made, it would be time to reconsider their requests for aircraft and other war material.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat he would be seeing M. Griperiborg that afternoon,in connection rith a request for medium artillery,which .the latter had made about a week ago.   Hesuggested that he should tell him that we were   waiting until the -Finnish Government decided they intended tomake the appco.,1 for Allied assistance.This proposal was agreed to.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs then drew attention to telegram Noe 33 Dipp. from france, in which the Ambassador reported that M. Legerfelt that wc could be well satisfied with the resultof our demarchesat Stockholm and Oslo, and thoughtthat if we continued with our plans, the Norwegiansand Swedes would not offer armed opposition.   On theother hand, in an unnumbered telegram dated 4th March

from Stockholm, it was stated that the Finnish minister in Sweden thought that although the Swedesmight not actually oppose our troops, they would offer passive resistance and remove rolling-stockout of our reach.   He thought that the statements ofthe French Government were influenced by the hope ofbeing able to do something to help the Finns and thusmaintain their own political position, rather than byan appreciation of the actual facts of the situation..The Foreign Secretary then referred to telegram Mo. 34 Dipp. from Paris, in which M* Legerwas reported as saying that General Sikorski had discussed the use of Polish troops with general gamelin about a week ago, and had agreed that 4,500Poles, who were all adequately equipped and trained,could be made available.   This contingent, togetherwith 3,000 French troops and 2,000 legionaries, made up the figure of 15,500 which had now been promisedthe Finnish Government from Paris.   He thought thatthe figures given in this telegram were at variance with the situation as it was understood here.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR V/AR said that hehad heard that General Sikorski had agreed to somePoles being sent, but our position was quite clear.We were not prepared to take more than one battalion,and in fact no preparations had been made for anymore.   Any greater number than that would not be welcome, and the Chief of the Imperial General staff had made that clear to the French.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought that,while it might be- desirable for a symbolic force of poles to be incorporated in the Allied expedition,it would be most unwise to break up the Polish Army,

which was in process of formation, by detaching any considerable number of partly trained troops.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR F0R1IGN affairs said that he had seen Mr Harold Macmillan, M.P., whohad just returned from Finland.   T:Ie had expressedthe opinion that the Gornans were hoping to mediateat tho right moment in the Finnish war so as to appear in the role of patron of Scandinavia.   He thought we might have been able to pass troops through Sweden ifwe had ^een ready to do so in the first week of theFinnish war, but that there -&quot;as little prospect of doing so now.    In any case, it was material that the finns needed, rather than men.The Tar Cabinet(a) Deferred consideration of Finnishrequests for the supply of bombingaircraft and war material until itwas known whether Finland would issue an appeal for Allied assistance in themanner proposed in the Allied plan:(b) Invited the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence to inform the Finnish minister that afternoon that we covild not deal withrequests for further war material beyond that already promised, until the finnish government had decided whether they intended to make the appeal for allied assistance:(c) Took note that the preparations beingma.de for the Allied expedition to scandinavia did not allow for theinclusion of more than one battalion of Poles in the force to be despatched.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.-5-

From:^   Military Attache Helsinki.To:-      The War Office.MOST IMMEDIATE.Following for 0.1.0.S-.    from King SalterNo. 5 in reply to 66124 (M.I.2h.) 2/3..Magill and I saw Field Marshal yesterday.We think he had seen Swedish Military Attache&apos;first Field Marshal told us at once that Sweden had refused.He was in state of very great depression,undoubtedly fully justified.Field Marshal had all his telegrams before him and is certainly fully in picture..     Read out many ofthe telegrams.     Finnish Minister in Paris had conveyedmany fantastic promises purporting to come from Frenchand (? ourselves) far exceeding actual British promises.This is one cause of misunderstanding.     Field Marshalsaid he had hoped to hold out in Karelian Isthmus one month longer.     Now he doubts very much of holding outeven until mid Maroh and in any case our proposed supportis so extremely small.     Only hope is if they can havebombers in one or two days.     They have facilities toreceive 100 bombers.     As regards official appeal hesaid this was question for his Government.     He hadalready made all appeals he could*     Russians couldnot attack across ice in South West of Viborg directionSakkijarvi and Wirolafti (two thirds of way to Kotka).

soAll communications greatly hindered by air bombing.Difficult withdrawal action to cover Capital becomingnecessary.Finnish General Staff state they can maketen trains available daily in Finland from Tornio.They cannot speak for Swedish railways but reckon(?re) trains possible daily in each direction on eachsingle line railway (effects of any bombing excluded)*In conclusion Finnish action hangs in balance.     First essential is for Allies to send(?100) bombers within day or two.     Second essentialis to do utmost really possible to support Finns(? with) troopsoThird essential is to restore morale ofFinnish G.H.Q. and Government.Magill has left by air for London due 6/3.I am going Viborg today.Please send copy to Foreign Office.
