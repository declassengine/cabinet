4 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.19tsSISTANCE TOflNIAND.Previous;eferences&apos;.M.(40) 64thsonclusions,minute 5)pommunicationsrora (i) Therench Ambassadorii) The Finnishinister..Confidential(Hth March.1940).The War Cabinet had before thes&amp;s^(i)   A Note by the French Ambassador givingthe views of the French Government onthe attitude to he adopted if Finlandappealed for assistance, (W,P? (40)92),(ii) A communication handed to the PrimeMinister by the Finnish Minister on10th March, 1940. (W.P. (40) 93),THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that just before the Finnish Minister1 s interview with the Prime Minister, he himself had received theFrench Ambassador, who had handed him the communication from the French Government, and had emphasised that inthe French view some of our messages to Finland had laid undue stress- on the difficulties wsd expected inobtaining passage for our troops through Scandinavia,,The French were preparing to despatch some bomber aircraft at once.Me Gripenberg in his interview with thePrime Minister had asked, first, on behalf of hisGovernment, for a statement to be made in the Houseof Commons on the lines proposed in paragraph 2 of theFinnish communication in order to strengthen their hands in their negotiations with the Russians and tokeep up the morale of Finland,   In the second placehe had pleaded, on his own account, for the immediate despatch of some bomber aircraft, say 8 to 18, as an earnest of our intentions.-1-

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the terms ofthe announcement for which the Finns had asked, namely,that the Allied Governments had &quot;decided jointly togive Finland all help, using all available resources at their disposal if the Finnish Government ask themfor help&quot; seemed to him unobjectionable.     The Finnswere, doubtless in a desperate position and were facedwith very stiff terms by the Soviet.       Theirnegotiators in Moscow were apparently shut off fromall communications from outside, and a public announce-ment was urgently required to give Finland some moral support.     He felt himself that we should show no hesitation at all.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER suggestedthat the terms of our declaration might include astatement to the effect that we had already preparedto send assistance to Finland.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that thedeclaration should also make it clear that we were putting no pressure on the Finns during their negotiations with Russia.     This would meet possiblecriticism from the extreme left of the Labour Party.THE PRIME MINISTER said that his intention was to have the question in the House worded in theform of a leading question, the reply to which mightwell cover these two points.     He observed that the finns had promised to decide by the 12th March whetheror not they were going to issue their appeal forassistance, but no doubt the Soviet would try to spinout negotiationsfor as long as possible.

At a later stage in the meeting copies ofthe draft Question to he asked and Answer to he given inthe House of Commons that afternoon, on the subject ofAllied assistance to Pinland? were handed rougd^and a number of amendments were agreed to.     A copyof the draft, as finally approved, is attached.THE PRIME MINISTER raised the question ofwhat his reply should be to   possible supplementaryquestions, enquiring whether the Government proposed toask Norway and Sweden for permission to pass through to the assistance of Finland and whether theGovernments of those countries had not already refused.In discussion it was suggested that thePrime Minister might take the line that he did not wish to add anything at the present time to the replyto be given to the Parliamentary Question.Despatch of THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that theAircraft.Finns had been told that the first contingent of 8aircraft would be ready to leave 4 days after they made their decision to appeal.       In fact,these aircraft could leave on the first suitable day after the 11thMarch.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that these aircraft should be despatched at the earliest possible moment,and that M. Gripenberg should be so informed, but thatno public statement should be made to this effect.     Weshould not lag behind the French in sending bomber,aircraft, but we should make the same conditions asM. Daladier had made, namely, that if the Finns madepeace, the bombers should be returned to us at once.   Hesuggested that he himself should inform M. Gripenbergof this decision, since the original communication hadbeen made to him personally.

The discussion then turned on the line to be taken  regarding the despatch of the expedition to scandinavia.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it would hefatal to abandon the expedition altogether merely because we had received a diplomatic refusal from theScandinavians to our demand for passage.     It would besaid that we had never meant business at all and thatour offer of assistance had been a mere sham.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that itwas impossible to foresee exactly the circumstances that would arise when our expedition arrived offNarvik, but he envisaged that the Admiral would immediately go ashore and inform the local authorities that he intended to land a force for the assistance ofthe Finns.     Meanwhile, parties from the ships would be making their way ashore, and agents of ours would be doing their best to influence the local population infavour of allowing our forces to pass through without opposition.      It would be a matter for persuasion andcajolery.     He did not think that the Norwegians wouldvigorously oppose our landing by force of arms.     Onceashore we should have secured a valuable prize not onlyin the possession of about a million and a half tons of iron ore but also in our occupation of the harbourwhich would be of the greatest use for naval purposes.Even if the railway had been sabotaged, our forces should instal themselves securely in the port in thehope that ultimately we might persuade the Scandinaviansto give us railway facilities for a further advance.

Discussion then turned on whether forces should he landed simultaneously at the otherNorwegian ports as well as at Narvik.    The FIRST LORDremarked that this was a very much bigger undertaking and did not seem essential for the achievement ofour ostensible object, which was assistance to the finns.    He would have preferred to secure Narvik firstbefore going in at the other ports, though he agreedthat the forces for these other ports should be readyto move at the same time.    If the worst came to the worst, and we could get no further than Narvik, oreven if we were unable to land altogether, the blow to our prestige would be small compared with theposition if we never sent our expedition at all,.He entirely agreed with the Prime Minister, therefore,that we should not bow .to a mere diplomatic refusalby the Scandinavian Governments.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out thatthe v/hole of the force for northern Sweden and Finlandcould not be landed at Narvik owing to the   lack oftransporation facilities.    Trondhjem was required asa base port to land the vehicles and transport ofthe expedition.    It was for this reason that theChiefs of Staff thought that landings at Trondhjem andNarvik should be simultaneous.Considerable discussion ensued on thedesirability of several simultaneous landings andon the procedure to be adopted if the Norwegians:,resisted.    The following were the principal points;

which emerged: -(i)   If the possession of Trondhjem was essential to get the full force requiredfor Finland ashore, a simultaneous landing at Trondhjem and Narvik would show clearly that we were determined to send all theassistance we could to Finland, which wasthe ostensible purpose of the wholeexpedition,,   A landing at Narvik alone would be open to suspicion, as showing that we were really only out to get controlof the orefields.(ii)   If the landing at Trondhjem was delayed,the Norwegians would have been put on theirguard and might be in a better positionto resist.    It might be true thatsimultaneous landings at the two portainvolved running a double risk, but onthe other hand if conditions provedfavourable at Narvik they were likely to be equally favourable at Trondhjem.(iii)      Z.3   regards the other Norwegian ports,Bergen was required for the completionof the Northern Barrage.    The possessionof Stavanger was necessary in order to deny the aerodrome to the Germans, who might otherwise operate air forces fromi^j against our shipping and naval forces and the base at Trondh;jemu    It would therefore be essential to have the forces for Bergen and Stavanger ready at the sametime as those for the other ports,(iv)    It would be undesirable to become involvedin a bitterly contested landing in whichNorwegian forces might suffer severecasualties, but our troops need notnecessarily be deterred by minor opposition,even though they might suffer somecasualties from it.    It v/as quite possiblethat the &quot;fire for effect&quot; would not haveto be opened on the Norwegians, who might give way as soon as they realised that wewere in earnest and determined to land.Our expedition, arriving hard on the heejls-.of a &quot;cri de coeur&quot; by the Finns, would&apos;have a good chance of meeting with afavourable reception from the Norwegianpeople.    The Instructions for the commanders concerned would however, have tobe carefully drafted0

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF explainedthat at Narvik the troops would not he landing in smallboats, but would come alongside in their transports.    the admiral in command would no doubt go ashore first, and,while he was arguing with the port authorities, the troops could be rapidly disembarked on the quay.    It would be forthe General in command to decide whether any opposition which they might meet was so serious that he could not continue the disembarkation.    The first move should be tosecure possession of the railway station and try to get a force up to the Swedish border and to picket the vulnerable points on the railway.,   We might then have to adopt similartactics with the Swedes to get them to operate the railwayfor  the forward move.   At Trondhjem the problem was somewhat different, as the ships might not be able to getalongsides    they could probably be moored close in to thesteep sides of the fjord, where they would obtain ameasure of protection against possible air attack.   A moveintothe interior immediately after landing would be less important from Trondhjem than from Narvik, since, in theformer case, there were roads on which the force couldmove, whereas at Narvik the railway was the only means ofcommunication-for the first 50 miles.Some discussion followed on whether we should givethe Norwegians prior notice of the despatch of the expeditionor whether it would be better for the ships to arrive off the ports without warning.    It was pointed out that they would beless likely to meet with active opposition if they arrivedwhhout

warning, but in any case the Scandinavian governments would have received the general warning which wasimplicit in the public declaration to be made by theAllies, and the Finnish appeal for help.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO recalled ahistorical precedent.     After the Treaty of Tilsit theCzar of Russia, egged on by Napoleon, invaded Finland,which was then under Swedish rule.The British Government, anxious to preventFinland and Sweden, which were an important source ofnaval stores, from falling under the domination ofNapoleon&apos;s ally, sent Sir John Moore with 12,000 mento Sweden.     This force arrived atGoteburg on 17thMay, but was not allowed to land by the Swedes.     sir john Moore then proceeded by land to Stockholm where he negotiated with King Gustavus.     The King insisted that the British troops should not land in Sweden, thathe should keep for himself the chief command, and thatthe British force should be employed outside Swedenwherever he should choose to send it.     On 17th june the King suggested that the British force should attempt a landing at Viborg, but as the Swedish army had by that time retired as far north as Uleaborg,Moore refused.     After further fruitless negotiations,the expedition returned on 3rd July, without any troopshaving been disembarked.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the Chiefsof Staff, in consultation with the Foreign Office,should examine the various considerations which hadbcsn brought to light in the course of the precedingdiscussion.

bill the SECRETARY OP STATE POP FQRE.IGX, A57AIRSthen read to the War Ishtne-t a. &quot;aesj&amp;age he had just received, giving an account of an interview which hadtaken place between Sir Alexander Cadogan and theFrench Ambassador.     The latter had said that theFrench were beginning to doubt whether we meantbusiness, and thought that our messages to the Finnswere having a discouraging effect.      The situation wascritical, with half the Finnish Government in favourof making teas with the Russians, and the Frenchurged that, as an immediate measure, we should despatchas many bombers as possible.     The French hoped thatwe should make as soon as possible a firm declaration,not hedged about with reservations, and not makingthe giving of assistance dependent on an appeal by the finns.     If our joint efforts to go to the assistanceof the Finns failed, M. Daladier&apos;s position would be extremely difficult, and he might have to resign.The War Cabinet took note of the aboveviews of the French Government.The War Cabinets-(i) Agreed that the Prime Minister shouldmake an announcement in the Houseof Commons that afternoon, on assistance to Finland, in the termsof the draft reply to a parliamentary Question, appended to this Annex.(ii) Agreed:(a) that immediate steps should betaken to despatch 8 long-nosedBlenheims to Finland, subjectto the stipulation that, if

If athe Finns made peace,these aircraft should he returned immediafcelyj and took note that the Prime minister would inform M. Gripehberg ofthis decision.(h) that preparations should continue for the despatch of 42 short-nosed Blenheims to Finland, &quot;butthat these aircraft should not hedespatched without a decision bythe War Cabinet.(iii) Invited the Chiefs of Staff:(l) To consider, in the light of thediscussion by the War Cabinet,and of the political situationnow envisaged, the implications of landing the proposed expeditionin Scandinavia, with particular reference to the following:(a) Should warning of our intentions to land in scandinavia be given inadvance to the Norwegian and swedish Governments?   (TheForeign Office to collaboratein formulating the answer tothe above question).(b) To what extent is it important from the military point ofview that we should land atTrondhjem as well as at Narvik?If so, need these landings besimultaneous?(c) Is it desirable from themilitary point of view toland at Bergen and Stavangerin addition to the above?If so, should these landingsbe simultaneous with that atTrondhjem?(3) In the light of the above review,to prepare draft instructions forthe Naval and Military Commandersin charge of the landings, setting out the principles which should govern their action in the various alternative situations which may arise.(3) To report to the War Cabinet on tuesday, 12th March.Richmond Terrace ?

TO BIS 5CKPT UMBIR LOGIC A KIDIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY W0CConfidential Annex.(11th March, 1940.)Ill1%ROYAL marine operation.(previous reference %W.M. (40)Conclusions,Minute 5.)THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY informed the War Cabinet that, in accordance with thedecision taken by the War Cabinet on 8th March, hehad the same day sent Admiral Royle with a personal letter from himself to General Gamelin describing the latest developments in connection with the preparations for the Royal Marine Operation, and explaining the importance which the British WarCabinet attached to the execution of this operation.In reply, General Gamelin had sent the following telegram dated the 8th March:-I       Yesterday, before leaving to spend48 hours in the operation zone, I received Admiral Royle.II I sent an immediate report to PresidentDaladier on the contents of the letter,of which Admiral Royle was the bearer.Ill       On Sunday morning, I shall call a Meetingof the Commanders-in-Chief, in order todiscuss with Admiral Darlan and GeneralVuillemin not the principles of operations,on which we are fully agreed, butquestions of dates and procedure at thestartoIV        I shall at once inform President Daladierof the conclusions reached by the meetingso that an immediate answer can be givento the First Lord.Continuing, the First Lord said that admiral Royle had returned from France on theprevious night and that he (the First Lord) had seenhim that morning.     Admiral Rbyle was very hopeful that the French would fall in with the operation,

which was now due to he launched at 8 p.m. on the 14th.The final answer of the French was not, however, due until after 1 p.m. that day.    2,000 fluvial mines, all of whichhad been tested, were now ready, and it was proposed that300 to 400 should be released on the first night.   AdmiralRoyle had seen General Bourre, commanding the French FifthArmy, in the area in v/hich the mines would be released, andhad found him extremely keen on the operation, and in no way apprehensive about the retaliation which it might provoke, saying that if the Germans were to bombardStrasbourg, he would reply on Karlsruhe.    General Gamelin&apos;sparting words to Admiral Royle were that he could not say anything definite until he had consulted   M. Daladier, whom he would be seeing that morning.   Admiral Darlan, however,was completely confident and optimistic that the FrenchGovernment would agree.In reply to a question from the Prime Minister,the First Lord confirmed that the river traffic betweenKarlsruhe, and Mannheim was almost entirely military.In answer to the Secretary of State for Air, hesaid that the French had made no specific objectionto the Royal Air Force side of the operation, but it hadbeen explained to them that this could not take placeuntil later on in April.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSquoted from a Report which had been drawn up in Belgium,based on recent and reliable information available in thatcountry, on the present railway situation in Germany.   Thisconfirmed our own information about the parlous state ofGerman rolling-stock.    To rectify the situation some

300,000 railway waggons were now needed, though to makeshift some 120,000 would suffice.    In these circumstances,the Germans were making every endeavour to develop water transport, for which purpose they were not onlybuying all the barges which they could, but were alsoholding up the return of Dutch barges.A discussion ensued on the question whether ashort warning of our intention to carry out this operation should be given to the Dominions and to&apos;the United Statesof iimerica.    There was general agreement that this wasa military operation, of which the success demanded thehighest secrecy, and that nothing should therefore be said in advance, either to the Dominions or to the UnitedStates of America,,    There would be no objection, however,to the Foreign and Dominions Offices holding cyphertelegrams in readiness for despatch as soon as theoperation had started.    It was suggested that these telegrams should emphasise the very good case which wehad, namely, that this operation, which aimed at -paralysingGerman inland water shipping, was our reply to Germany&apos;sattempt to paralyse our coastal shipping.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement,and agreed:-That no warning of the operation shouldbe given either to the Dominions or tothe United States of America, thoughappropriate telegrams should be preparedby the,Foreign and Dominions Offices for despatch once the operation had been launched.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
