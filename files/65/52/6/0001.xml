CommitteeMinisters shouldtheir most secreabinet had before them a Memorandumn policy towards Siam, reviewing thethe discussions with the Siamese .expressing the view that it was ofe that we should now reach athe terms on which we should begnise and work for an effectiveon movement.      It was suggested that committee should investigate thist their recommendations to the, and that, the Dominion Primebe informed of the position fort and personal information.THE MINISTER OP STATE said that the proposals in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper arose from thediscussions which had recently taken place atLord Louis Mountbatten&apos;s Headquarters with a mission from Siam.      In those discussions the part whichSiam might be able to play in getting rid of theJapanese had been examined,  and there had been someinvestigation of the intentions of the Siamese asregards the return of the United Nations&apos;  territories which they had occupied.      The Siamese had shownevery sign of wanting to co-operate and had urgedthat they had been led into siding with the Axis bya Quisling minority.      They were willing to return the areas which they had occupied;    and had suggestedthat,  until we actually invaded Siam,  the presentSiamese Government would do all it could to thwartJapanese intentions.      Once the invasion had takenplace the present Siamese Government would resign, andbe replaced by a previously constituted SiameseResistance Government, which would set up a new administration in a place safe from Japaneseinterference where they could work to assist theAllies.Simultaneously there had been discussions between the Siamese Minister in Washington and theUnited States Government on much the same lines,save that the Minister had suggested that thereshould at once be established a Provisional Governmentoutside Siam which should be recognised by theAllies, and that the question of Indo-China shouldbe submitted to an International Commission.      TheUnited States had informed us of these conversations,and, while not supporting the proposal for a FreeSiamese Provisional Government, had suggested thatthere would be advantage in the establishment of a free Siamese Liberation Committee in Washington.

THE MINISTER OP STATE said that the foreign secretary felt it would be a mistake at the presenttime to recognise the Siamese&apos;Committee of NationalLiberations  since no positive advantage would accrue from our doing so and the Japanese would realise that something was happening behind the scenes,iit the same time he felt that it was now urgentto consider our own attitude towards an effectiveSiamese Liberation Movement and that the ParEastern Committee should be instructed to formulate proposals for consideration by theArmistice and Post-War Committee.THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE said thatthe attitude of the United States was more pro-Siamese that ours.        He was in entire agreementwith the course of action proposed by the foreign secretary.      S.O.E., which had a number of missions in Siam, were anxious that the Siamese should be encouraged to harbour them and co-operate with usbehind the scenes.      The Supreme Commanderthought that these missions could make animportant contribution to the progress of the campaign in this theatre.The War Cabinet -(1 ) Approved the proposals in theForeign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum(W.P.(h5) 2k9) and invited theMinister of State to arrangefor the Directive set out in annex I of the Memorandum to becommunicated to the Par EasternCommittee.(2) Invited the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs to explain theposition to the Dominion PrimeMinisters for their most secret and personal information.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.
