THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF BIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. 16It is issued for the personal use of.....TOP secret copy^No.(oW.M.(45) 4STH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential Annex(20th April, 1945 - 3.00 p.m.)COMPULSORYMILITARYSERVICE(previous reference:W,M.(44)141 stConclusions,Minute 6)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(W.P.(45) 242) by the Lord President of the Councilembodying the views of the Armistice and Post-war committee on the continuance after the war of some formof compulsory service.The conclusion of the Committee was that,though it should be our ultimate aim to reduce the burdenof our responsibilities, and of the armaments requiredfor their fulfilment, by the strongest possible support for international arrangements which would contribute to this end, this should not deter us from deciding t*maintain compulsory military service until the future&apos;could be seen more clearly.     The Committee suggestedthat, if their conclusions were endorsed by the WarCabinet, an early announcement might be made of thedecision of principle and the Committee could then proceed to examine the details of the problem and twwork out a concrete scheme in consultation with thevarious interests concerned.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was gratifyingthat the Committee should have been able to reach agreed conclusions on this important issue;   and it would be ofenormous benefit to the country if a decision acceptingin principle the need for continuing a system of compulsory military service for a period after the war could bereached and announced by a Coalition Government in whichall the principal politioal Parties were represented.It would be a very grea-o advantage if this difficult issuecould be removed from, the; area of political controversy between the Parties at the next General Election.Discussion then turned on the procedure to befollowed in preparation for such a public announcement.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE saidthat he and his Labour colleagues in the War Cabinet were anxious to have an opportunity of consulting with responsiblemembers of their Party before any public announcement wasmade.     They feared that if this conclusion were announcedas a decision of the Government, without any such consult-ation, there was likely to be controversy in Labour circles.If, however, they were able to put the issues plainly t*responsible members of the Labour Party and the TradesUnion Congress, in confidence, and to discuss with themtheir political and economic implications, they were confident that they would be able to secure the support of the labour movement.     It was true that this procedure would involve some risk of premature disclosure;   but, on balance, thatrisk seemed to be outweighed by the advantage *f being ableto secure a solid measure of support for a decisionfavouring the principle of retaining compulsory militaryservice for a period after the war.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE&apos; FOR AIR felt doubtful about the expediency of the course recommended by theMinister of Labour and National Service.     He himselffully supported the conclusion reached by the armistice and Post-War Committee.     He would, however, find difficulty in persuading the Liberal Party to&apos;givewholehearted support to this conclusion.     these difficulties would be increased if it were necessaryfor him te consult with members of his Party before aGovernment decision was finally taken.     His best prospect of securing the agreement of his Party was t**.Be able to tell them that this conclusion was endorsed by all the members of the Government, ef whateverpolitical persuasion, and represented a firm decisiono f the War Cabinet.THE. PRIME MINISTER said that he also wouldhave been disposed to favour an announcement of aGovernment decision on the point oflTprinciple,without prior consultation, with any interests outsidethe Government.      He was not influenced by the riskof premature disclosure;   but he would have expectedgreater difficulty in getting this conclusiongenerally accepted if consultations took place on thebasis that the Government had not reached a final...conclusion.The War Cabinet -(l) Endorsed the conclusion set outin paragraph 8 of W.P. (1+5)&apos; 21+2,I(2) &quot;Took note that the Minister ofLabour and National Service would consider his suggestions on future procedure, in the light ofthe discussion;    and agreed to resume at an early meeting their discussion of the next steps tobe taken in this matter.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.
