The War Cabinet considered a telegram from HisSONERS     Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne reporting a message from theWAR Swiss Legation in Berlin about Allied prisoners of war- inGermany.     This stated that the German Ministry of Foreignevious     Affairs had indicated that the German Government weregrence:   prepared to agree not to remove into the interior Allied(45)21 stPpisoners of war now irL camps close to the present Westernelusions Front, on condition that the Allied Governments gave anute&apos; 5)    &apos;official assurance that such prisoners will not participatefurther in the war.The view of the War Cabinet was that this proposal should be accepted and the required assurance given.      Itwas likely that the United States Government would take thesame view;    and they should be invited to join us at once in accepting the proposal.Points in further discussion were -(a) The communication referred to &quot;Allied Governments&quot;,it was not clear whether the Germans would require theSoviet Government&apos;s acceptance, as well as that of HisMajesty!s Government and the United States Government, before putting their proposal into effect.      It might be that theSoviet Government would not view the proposal favourably.While, however, they should be informed at once of the reply which was being returned by His Majesty&apos;s Government and theUnited States Government, there seemed no reason why their consent should be obtained to action by the two other AlliedGovernments in respect of this arrangement in the westerntheatre of war.(b) The desired assurance that these prisoners would not participate further &quot;in the war&quot; presumably referred only tothe war against Germany.      It might, however, be dangerous toraise this point in our reply to the German Government,  as itmi .ht appear to qualify our acceptance of the proposal.     we need not regard ourselves as &quot;bound to ensure that none ofthese prisoners subsequently took an active part in the war against Japan.(c) As regards the French Government,  it would be sufficientto inform them of this approach as soon as our reply had beensent to the Swiss Government and suggest that they might wishto be associated with these arrangements.The War Cabinet -Invited the Foreign Secretary to communicate atonce with the United States Government on thelines agreed, in the discussion, as recorded above.Offices of the.War Cabinet,  SVwll.
