THJS DOCDMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNHEITThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.....^.^..... :...3^!sJ.o^.WBhp SECRET Copy No......W.M.(h5) 52ND conclusions confidential Annex(25th April, 1945 - 4.30 p.m.)fllTARYliUATIONThe War Cabinet met to consider a telegramfrom H.ivi. Minister at Stockholm (No.  711    of25th April) reporting a conversation which he andhis United States colleague had had the previous evening with the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairsaccompanied by M. Boheman and Count Bernadotte.Bernadotte had just returned from an interview with Himmler, which took place at Lubeckon the morning of 24th April, at the latter&apos;request.      Himmler had told him that Hitler wasmortally ill, as a result of haemorrhage of thebrain,  and could not live for more than two days.Himmler was, therefore,  in a position of full authority;    and asked Bernadotte to communicate tothe Swedish Government his desire to meetGeneral Eisenhower in order to arrange a capitulationof the German forces on the whole of the western front. -   When Bernadotte said that he was unwilling to transmit this request unless Norway and .Dehmarkwere included in the capitulation, Himmler had replied that he was prepared to order the germans in Denmaric and Norway to surrender to either British,American or Swedish troops.     Himmler had said thathe had hoped to continue resistance on the eastern front, and in particular hoped that the Anglo-American forces rather than the Russians would bethe first to enter. Mecklenborg in order to save the civilian population.      Bernadotte had said that a surrender on the Western front only would bescarcely possible in practice and would not b6acceptable to the Allied Powers.On receiving this message H.M. Minister andhis United States colleague had said that the Nazisv/ould have to surrender to all the. Alliessimultaneously.      Himmler&apos;s reluctance to ordersurrender on the Eastern front looked like a lastattempt to sow discord between the, &quot;Western Alliesand Russia.      The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs,while admitting that this motive could not be excluded,  had pointed out that the capitulation ofall the German forces on the Western front and in norway and Denmark would be a great advantage tothe Allies as a whole and would,  in fact, lead atan early date to the total capitulation of.Germany.He added that, so far as concerned the swedish government,  the Governments of the United Kingdomand the United States would be completely at liberty to.transmit this information to the Soviet Government -the Swedish Government could not themselves inform theSoviet Government directly as. Himmler had stipulated that this information was exclusively for the western allies.

IflSIIP 26. THE PRIME MINISTER said that this important- development must clearly be communicated to marshal Stalin without delay.      He thought that weshould at the same time make it clear that, so f^ar asHis Majjesty^ Government were concerned, there couldbe no question of anything less than unconditional surrender simultaneously to the three major Powers.Himmler-should be told that German soldiers shouldeverywhere surrender themselves,, either as individuals or in units, to the Allied troops orrepresentatives on the spot;    and that until this happened the Allies&apos;  attack upon them in all theatres would be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.The Prime Minister suggested that we could safely communicate on these lines with Marshal Stalinwithout first consulting the United States/Government;but he proposed that&quot;, without delaying the despatchof this message&apos; to Stalin, he should informPresident Truman by telephone of the message whichhe had sent and invite him, to telegraph on similar lines to Marshal Stalin.It was clear that Himmler was purporting to act onbehalf of the German Government.       The surrender whichhe. offered was therefore a matter for discussion between Governments.      There was no occasion for himto meet General Eisenhower, as he had suggested:indeed,  it would be inappropriate that such aproposal for a general surrender should be discussed with the military Commander in the field.      It would,however, be appropriate that General Elsenhower shouldbe made aware of this approach and informed that thematter was being dealt with between Governments,The War Cabinet endorsed the Primeminister!s proposal;    and later inthe meeting the Prime Minister spoke to General Eisenhower on the telephone and informed him accordingly.Discussion ensued about the means of accepting the surrender of German forces in territories wherethere were no Allied troops.      It was the view of theWar Cabinet that representatives of the norwegian government and British military officers should be flown to Norway to accept the surrender of german forces there.     Danish representatives and british officers should similarly be flown to Denmark at theappropriate time.      Detailed arrangements foraccepting the German surrender in the Channel islands and the French ports should be worked out.The War Cabinet -(1) Agreed that the Prime Minister should communicate to Marshal Stalin the text of the Stockholm telegram No&quot;. 7i i of25th April, with a message in the following terms - *&quot;There can be no question, as far as HisMajesty&apos;s Government are concerned, ofanythingvless than unconditional surrender -simultaneously to the three major Powers.We consider that Kimmler should be told that German forces, either as individuals or .in units, should everywhere

surrender themselves to theAllied troops or representatives on the spot.     Until this happensthe attack of the Allies upon them on all sides and in all theatreswhere resistance continues will.be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.Nothing in this telegram shouldaffect the release of our orationson the link-up&quot;.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform President Truman, by telephone,that he was telegraphing in these terms to Marshal Stalin and would invite himto send a message in similar terms.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W.1.-3-
