Molotovand the Foreign.Secretary and the United States Secretaryof State, and between President Truman and M. Molotov,about the arrangements for the reconstitution of thePolish.Government.Tne Foreign Secretary and Mr. Stettinius had had long discussions with M. Molotov on the evening of 22ndApril and the morning of 23rd April but had made no .progress towards reaching agreement.      M. Molotov hadbased himself,  throughout these discussions, onMarshal Stalin&apos;s telegram to President Roosevelt of 7th April and had shown himself unwilling to take accountof the joint message which the Prime Minister and president Truman had sent to Marshal Stalin on 15th   -April.      Later on 23rd April President Truman had se*enM. Molotov and had handed him a statement for trans-mission to Marshal Stalin (reproduced in F.0.   telegramfrom Washington No. 2842 of 23rd April).      In this message it was made clear that, in the opinion of theUnited States Government, the decisions of the Crimea conference would not be carried out unless a group ofgenuinely representative democratic Polish leaders were invited to Moscow for consultation.      The United StatesGovernment could not be a party to any method of consultation with Polish leaders which would not resultin the establishment of a new Provisional Government ofNational Unity genuinely representative of the democraticelements of the Polish people..     The United StatesGovernment and the United Kingdom Government had goneas far as they could to meet the situation in the jointmessage from the Prime Minister and President Truman dated15th April.      The United States Government urged theSoviet Government to accept the proposals set out inthat message and asked that M. Molotov should continuethe conversations with the Foreign Secretary andMr. Stettinius in San Francisco on that basis.      The .Soviet Government must realise that failure to go forward at this, time to implement the Crimea decisions on poland would seriously shake confidence^ in the unity of the three Governments and their determination tocontinue to collaborate In the future as they had inthe past.THE PRIME MINISTER.said that he fully approved the line taken by President Truman in his interview withM. Molotov and his message to Marshal Stalin.      In his view,  it was out of the question that the Governments ofthe United Kingdom and the United States should acquiesce in any attempt by the.Soviet Government to avoid

implementing the decisions reached at Yalta on poland;    and the proper course at this stage was to stand firm on the line taken in the joint message to Marshal Stalin of 15th April,      Though we had thought it expedient that the United StatesGovernment should take the lead in the representations made to the Soviet Government on the Polish question,it was important that our policy should be keptclosely in line with that of the United StatesGovernment and that we should continue to support their representations..     He therefore proposedthat he should send a personal telegram to marshal stalin informing him that the War Cabinet had considered, and fully supported, the message sentto him by President Truman through M. Molotov.Copies of a draft telegram to marshal stalin were handed round for consideration bythe War Cabinet.. &apos; -The War Cabinet -Endorsed the proposals made by thePrime Minister and invited him to despatch a telegram to Marshal Stalinin the terms of the draft discussed and to inform President Truman thatthis had been done.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W..1.%
