He thought that, inview of President Roosevelt&apos;s death, he must now take the lead in continuing this exchange with Marshal Stalin, butit was most important that the United Kingdom and UnitedStates Governments should continue to march in closeaccord in their handling of these representations to theSoviet Government in respect of Poland.    He, therefore,proposed to prepare a draft reply to Marshal Stalin,which he would send to the Foreign Secretary in washington,  so that the latter might take the opportunityof discussing its terras personally with President Trumanand Mr. Stettinius.It was encouraging that Marshal Stalin should have indicated readiness to use his influence with the lublin government to persuade them to withdraw their objectionsto M. Mikolajczyk&apos;s participation in the consultationsabout the reconstitution of the Polish Government,  if thelatter were willing to make a public statement accepting the decisions of the Crimea Conference on the polish question and declaring that he favoured the establishmentof friendly relations between Poland and the soviet union.      The Prime Minister said that he hoped thatM. Mikolajczyk could be induced at least to declarehimself in favour of friendly relations between Poland andthe Soviet Union.      If he were unwilling to go even sofar as  that,  it would be impossible for us to continueto press the suggestion that he should participate in the consultations about the reconstitution of the PolishGovernment,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had arranged tosee M.  Mikolajczyk that day.    He might not now be able to conduct this interview himself,  but he would certainlysee that strong pressure was put on M. Mikolajczyk tomake a public statement in the sense suggested by thePrime Minister.The War Cabinet -Invited the Prime &quot;Minister to arrange for a reply to be sent to Marshal Stalin&apos;telegram after consultation, as suggested,with the United States authorities.benefices of the War Cabinet,S.
