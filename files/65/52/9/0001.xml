Lord Wavell&apos;s proposals had essentially been that he should be given a freehand to replace his present Executive Council by persons selected as a result of discussion with theleaders of the organised political parties.-    Thiswould incidentally involve the removal, which wouldrequire legislation, of the existing statutoryrequirement that not less than three members of theGovernor-General&apos;s Council should have ten years&apos;service under the Crown in India.The Committee were unanimous in opposing thisproposal, and were not prepared to recommend thatthe Viceroy should return to India with a free hand.They doubted whether he understood the enormousconstitutional implications of   his scheme.      On theother hand, there were powerful arguments against allowing the Viceroy to return empty-handed, now thathe was known to have been in consultation with HisMajesty&apos;s Government on these questions.      TheCommittee had,,however, been unable themselves toreach a unanimous conclusion as to whether the case for-a new step was established, and their report (inparagraph 5) therefore set out the arguments on bothsides with a view to a decision being taken by theWar Cabinet..    If the War Cabinet,  in the light of thereport, decided on a new. step, the Committee was.,however,  in a position to make specific recommendations as to what it should be, and those recommendations were set out in paragraph 11 of their report and inthe appendix to it.So far as he personally was concerned,  he wasimpressed by the arguments against action,  but he recognised at the same time the force of the considerations in favour of not allowing the viceroy to return empty-handed.   .  The best single argument wasthe world-wide feeling that we were called on to do something for India. . He was bound at the same time tosay that he was very sceptical ,as to  the prospects ofIndia accepting the scheme now under consideration.

*    THE PRIME MINISTER expressed the indebtedness ofthe War Cabinet to the India Committee for their report.He was far from convinced on- the case for any action atthis stage.     Legislation was involved:    could we be sure that it would be passed into law without difficulty?The problem of parliamentary time was also particularlyacute;      There was also the question whether it wasproper for a Government to take a step so important as this towards the very end of its life?     All thesematters had to be weighed.But apart from this the scheme now proposed was neither one thing nor the other.       The removal of theofficial element in the Executive Council was a matterof great importance.     But the impression it would produce would be that of a minor legislative change.Secondly, as paragraph 15 of the draft statement showed,all power would still be held by the Viceroy and theCommander-in-Chief under the scheme proposed.     No Indianwould accept a scheme of this nature.     Nor were any ofthe accompaniments of the constitutional change,  such asthe transfer of external affairs, of real significance.The only result, he feared, would be to produce a less efficient Executive Council.He was bound to stand by the Cripps proposals,and he- did so.      But it was not our fault if Indiansfound it impossible to agree among themselves.      If the hindus, Muslims and other communities were prepared toaccept the Cripps offer, he would be quite ready tosee the Army withdrawn and India given full dominion status.      It would indeed,    from the military point ofview, be a help to be relieved of our share in her defence.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said that lord Wavell!s original proposal was open to criticism,but had been  turned into a workable scheme by theCommittee.      It was common ground that India could notbe given Dominion status now because the essentialpre-condition,  of agreement among Indians,  could not be fulfilled.      He thought that the Committee&apos;s proposals would secure ready parliamentary approval from bothsides of the House;    and while they might appear to belimited, in scope, we should not underestimate their importance.      Timing was very material.      The troubleabout the Crippsjoffer had been that it had been fromweakness.      The present proposal would, however, be made from strength.Moreover, these proposals were within the framework of our previous offer, which we had already reaffirmed.If accepted,  they would remedy the weakness of the IndianExecutive, which was the absence of outside support fromthe press or the public.      Admittedly, the Indians mightreject them.      But if they did we should ourselves be no worse off, and we should have1greatly improved ourposition vis-a-vis of the outside world.     He himselfhoped that the widespread feeling in India that amistaice had been made in boycotting the Cripps offer would help to secure an acceptance of the present scheme.He felt strongly that the case for a move at this stagewas a good one, and that there could be no objection toits being made at this point in the Government&apos;s life.T&quot;It would not provoke controversy in Parliament.    nor would there be any immediate demand for Parliamentary timefor legislation.     All that was needed was a declaration on the lines of the statement and an undertaking that,  ifthe Viceroy Was successful, we should legislate.     If wedeclined to make any move there would certainly be sharpcriticism, and real pressure for a debate which could not

THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OP HOME SECURITYwas sympahtetic to the making of a move.      He felt thatthe issue was not likely to be of great electoralimportance either way.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR looked on this small stepas merely a further move in the right direction whichcreated a sense of progress towards Dominion status,which he still &apos;thought would save India.     He did not agree that we should do nothing unless we could do something really substantial.      There was value in everystep slowly taken in the case of the Central Government.He would prefer himself to settle the Indian problemon unwritten constitutional lines, and not to make toobig a step at a time.The Indians had made a mistake in rejecting theCripps offer and probably realised that now.      We shouldbe no worse off if these proposals were rejected.     Withthe example of -Russia over the border the problem ofIndia must be faced either politically or economicallyin a few years, and he thought-that as we had missedour chance in that country in many ways in the past,we must watch our policy carefully in respect of thefuture.      He would be happier, at the same time, if he felt more confident that this proposal would not bere jected.THE SECRETARY 0? STATE PGR WAR feared that thescheme would be rejected.      If, however,  it was nominallyaccepted, there were long odds that the result would bea Bania Government, and that the scheme would be workedessentially under Hindu domination to the advantage ofthe moneylending class.THE MINISTER OP AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION said that theCommittee had agreed that if there was to be a step forward,  it should be on the lines of the draft state-ment appended to their report.      Ordinary majoritygovernment was impracticable in India.    It was equallynot practical for us  to &quot;quit India&quot;.      In favour of astep forward at this stage there was first,  the view ofthe Viceroy, of every Governor and of the European membersof the Executive Council that something should be done tobreak the deadlock now.      Secondly,  if we were going toget a peaceful solution of the Indian problem, we mustassuage the growing sense of frustration among Indians.A step of the sort suggested by the Committee would ease the tension and improve the chance of bringing India inas a Dominion in the Commonwealth.      He himself would bevery strongly opposed to missing the opportunity arisingfrom the Viceroy&apos;s visit.      If the offer was made and rejected,  the matter dropped,  but our position would be improved by our initiative.      It was critical that something should be done now to prevent deterioration.No parliamentary time would be needed except for themaking of the statement.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that thepresent&apos; position was that we had in the Provincesresponsible and representative governments, based in manycases on a legislature, with powers over a wide field,working under a written constitution.      At the Centre therewas a Government,  technically composed of officials, with powers of supervision and control.      That was a fundamentallyunsound position.      When the   Act of 1935 was passed,  ithad never been contemplated that there should be an indefinite continuance of responsible governments in theprovinces coupled with an official government at the Centre.

The essence of the Viceroy&apos;s proposal was that pending the reconstitution of the Centre on representativelines,  we should endeavour to bring into the. ExecutiveCouncil persons deriving authority from some representativecapacity.      His own misgiving about Lord Wavell&apos;s proposal,had been that he felt,  as.he still to some extent did,       - .that the Viceroy did not see its implications.      TheCommittee had therefore sought to find a way of making clear, both in India and in this country, what was involved.The Viceroy urged that if nothing was done,  there would be great danger of serious political unrest once the pressure of the war was removed.      We must give weight to hisopinion,  since he had been in office for eighteen months,and had been in contact with governors and officialswith long experience of India.As the Committee&apos;s proposal was framed, we should,if it failed,  be in a better and not a worse position asa result of having made it since we should have gone asfar as was humanly possible.      The parliamentary statement (however limited in its content) which wouldbe necessary, would give an opportunity of making ourposition clear-    In all these circumstances,  though not without misgiving, he favoured giving the Viceroy the chance of making a move on the basis of the draft statement prepared by the Committee.THE MINISTER OP EDUCATION felt that it was politically inexpedient to make any move at present.There was no proof that the Muslims would accept a move of this type.      Nothing had been said about the Statesand both the Muslims   and. the Princes were very upset atthe moment.      He was all for  an   alteration in ourrelations with India but could not believe that this wasthe moment for it.    If,  on the other hand,  the WarCabinet decided that something had to be done,  then hewould accept the statement prepared by the Committee asthe best method.      But he felt himself that the matter should.first be further tested on the spot and that theWar Cabinet should have before them fuller reports as tothe attitude of the Princes and the Muslims.      our friends would say that the effect of this scheme would beto revivify the Congress which by its totalitarianism had   .wrecked- first the Act of 1935 and then the Cripps offer.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR thought that therewould certainly.be a demand for a debate if the Viceroywas sent back empty-handed or resigned.After further discussion THE PRIME MINISTER saidthat while still very doubtful as to the case for a move,particularly at this late stage in the life Of theadministration, he recognised the force of the argument that any action taken now would be taken by an all-partygovernment.      Difficult questions of parliamentary time were, however,  involved in any legislation or debate,and would have to be investigated.      He did not feelthat an immediate decision could be reached, and suggestedthat the discussion should be adjourned until a later date.      In the meantime he would consider the matterfrom the point of view of the state of public business.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W,1.
