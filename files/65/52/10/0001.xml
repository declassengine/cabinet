(45) 299) covering an exchange of telegrams between President Truman and the Prime Ministerabout the situation in Venezia Giulia.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that Venezia Giuliawas acquired by Italy after the last war;    thepopulation was largely Yugoslav and only partly Italian;and it had long been recognised that the future of theprovince would have to be determined in the peace settlement..     Pending discussion in the peace settlement,it had been assumed that the province would be placed under the -military government of Field Marshal Alexander,who would occupy and administer it on behalf of all theUnited Nations.     Field Marshal Alexander had discussed the position with Marshal Tito at their meeting in belgrade in February, 1945,  and had reached an under-standing . with him that, as the port of Trieste and the communications from there into Austria via Gorizia andTarvisio would be essential for maintaining the advanceof our armies from Italy into Austria,  he would have full control in these areas..     In the event, however, regular forces of the Yugoslav Army had overrun a large part ofVenezia Giulia and had not only occupied the country districts- where Yugoslav guerillas had previously been active, but had also entered the towns of Pola, Trieste,Gorizia and I Monfaleone where the bulk of the populationwas Italian.      Formations of the 15th Army Group advancingfrom the west had reached Trieste at about the same time andand had taken the surrender of the German garrisons inTrieste and elsewhere.      Field Marshal Alexander hadthereupon proposed to Marshal Tito that the Yugoslavtroops and administration should be withdrawn from thewestern part of Venezia Giulia, so as to enable him tocontrol the lines of communication by road and rail fromTrieste into Austria;    anc he had proposed to establish an Allied Military Government in this western part, ofthe province,  on the understanding that this arrangement was made purely in the interests of military convenienceand would in no way prejudice the ultimate disposal ofthe territory in the peace settlement.Field Marshal Alexander had sent his Chief of Staff,General Morgan, to discuss the situation with MarshalTito in Belgrade.      At this meeting, which took place on 9th and 10th May, Marshal Tito had claimed that the collapse of German resistance had produced a new situationin which Anglo-American control in these areas was nolonger required for the purpose of supporting difficultmilitary operations into Austria.      He had, therefore,declined to accept. Field Marshal Alexanders proposals;and had taken the line that the Yugoslav Government shouldbe free to occupy the whole of the province east of theIsonzo river, on the ground-that they had conquered this &quot;

territory&apos; aai intended to claim it in the peace; settlement;.:&apos;.He. was, however, -prepared..to discuss a scheme J? or. establish--&apos;.ing arrangements, for&apos; goint&quot;military command in-the area, and1,for providing Field Marshal Alexander with, f facilities. fOr maintaining his communications into Austria from Trieste.Field- Marshal Alexander had informed- Marshal Tito that hewas unable to discuss arrangements on these lines;    that     - :further military conversations v/ould be unavailing,    andthat the whole question of control over Venezia Giulia must,/now be pursued between Governments.&apos;--&apos;-,&apos;.&apos; in reporting on these unsatisfactory developments,-Field Marshal Alexander had naturally been concerned toknow what formations he would have at his disposal if it became necessary in the last resort to use force in 1 support ;of Government, policy, in Venezia Giulia and Austria.     Hehad been specially anxious to know whether he would continueto have at his disposal for this purpose the seven United aStates Divisions now under his command.There had boon grounds for-special anxiety,on this point,     in view of the tone of-earliermessages from President Truman on this subject and,in particular, the line taken in his telegram to the Prime,..-Minister (No.  18) of 30th.April,  in which he had stated thathe wished &quot;to avoid having American forces used to fightYugoslav forces or being used in combat in the Balkanpolitical arena&quot;.&quot;&apos;&apos; &apos;,All these anxieties had, however, been removed by president Truman13 telegram to the Prime Minister (No. 34)of 12th May.      in this he had indicated that, since sendinghis telegram of 30th April,  he had become increasingly   ..-concerned over the implications of Marshal Tito&apos;s actions .in Venezia Giulia and southern Austria;    and had reachedthe conclusion that we must decide now whether we shoulduphold the fundamental principles of territorial settlement by orderly process as against force,  intimidation orblackmail.      The present  issue,  as he now saw it, was&apos;not one of talking sides in a dispute between Italy and Yugoslavisor becoming involved in .internal Balkan politics;    it,was &apos;a question of deciding whether the Governments of the United-States and the United Kingdom were going to permit their allies to engage in uncontrolled annexations of territory by  ftactics resembling those of Nazi Germany and Japan.      he therefore suggested that the minimum on which we should insist was that Field Marshal Alexander should obtain com-plete&apos;and exclusive control of Trieste and Pola, the line-of communication through Gorizia and    Monfalcone,  and an area sufficiently to the east of this, line to permit properadministrative control.    . He proposed, as -a first step,that the British and American Ministers in Belgrade shouldbe instructed, to explain the attitude of their Governments,. .in the terms set out in his telegram, anc  to ask that the yugoslav Government should immediately agree to the establish-ment in this area of an Allied Military Government;under the   iauthority of Field Marshal Alexander, and should issue instructions to the Yugoslav forces in this region to co-operate accordingly..     President Truman further suggestedthat Marshal Stalin should be informed,  in&apos; accordance withthe agreement reached at Yalta for consultation on suchmatters;    and in conclusion,  ex-pressed the view that if we.stood firm on this issue, as on Poland, we could hope to-avoid a host of other similar &apos;encroachments.The Prime Minister sale, that he had&apos;been muchencouraged by the firmness of this message..    He understood-that it had been sent after consultation with the UnitedStates Chiefs of Staff; &quot;ana from Washington telegram No. 3296of 12th May it appeared that,  in the view of the -state department, the President was resolved thatif. Marshal Tltddeclined to accept the ar rang erne nt&apos; proposed., * British&apos; and&apos;

&apos; American&apos;-troops should mfcve&apos; in and occupy- the area,  if    - &apos;tiece8s^ry&apos; by f oree.      The -prime&apos; Minister, said that -he- had thought it fight to send an immediate telegram to president truman (No. 2+5&apos; of 12th May) concurring in the, view that thesituation must, be handled firmly, and agreeing with the -    . ,course of action proposed . in the Presidents telegram.      He1.-,had -suggested one small amendment in the text of  uhecommunication to be made to the Yugoslav Government, so asto make it. clear that the area to be placed under thecontrol of Field Marshal Alexander -woula include the lineof.communication through Gorzia and   Monfalcone to Austria.He had suggested that President Truman should now proceed,.without further reference to him,  to instruct the UnitedStates Minister in Belgrade to make this communication tothe Yugoslav Government;    and.he had authorised HisMajesty&apos;s Minister in-Belgrade to make a smiliar communi-.-cation on behalf of the United Kingdom Government con-       ,   -forming,  as.regards the final text and method of delivery,with the instructions received from Washington by the UnitedStates Minister.-The War Cabinet endorsed the action taken by thePrime Minister, and took note, with approval, of the termsof his telegram to President Trum n Ho. 2+5 of 12th May;&apos;In the discussion which ensued, the following points were raised --(a) THE PRIME MINISTER stressed the need for re- &apos;affirming at this stage the principle that all territorialclaims should be left to be determined by the peace settle-ment and not pre-judged by the unilateral establishment of sovereignty through military occupation.      He thought itspecially important that the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and the United States  should take a firm stand onthis issue of principle before the Anglo-American forcesin Europe had been substantially reduced.      He had referredto this point in some general reflections on the Europeansituation which he had communicated to President Trumanin his telegram No. I4I4. of 12th May,  in the course of whichhe had referred to the prominence g ven by the Press toreports of substantial movements of American military forces from Europe.      For this reason he had suggested to president Truman,  in paragraph 2 of his telegram No. 2+5of 12th May,  that a standstill order might be given to delay the movement of American armies and air forces from europe, at any rate for a few weeks;    and had undertaken&quot;chat,  if such a standstill order were given, we would conform to it in .our demobilisation plans.The Prime Minister&apos; recognised that this proposal might delay our own-redeployment to the Far East, with theresult that some delay might be imposed on projectedoperations in South East Asia.      Further,  it might possibly have some effect on the present plans for commencing demob-,ilisation six weeks after the end of hostilities&quot; in Europe.He believed however that,  if the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and&apos;the United States took a firm line over thesituation .in Venezia Giulia and southern Austria, -it wouldnot in the event prove necessary to use force against the yugoslav troops in these areas;    and the position might be clarified in time to prevent a standstill&quot;order from havingany substantial effect on o,ur demobilisation plans or even,perhaps, on our arrangements for redeployment to the Far East.(b) President Truman had suggested that Marshal Stalinshould be informed of the communication which v/e we re-proposing to make to the Yugoslav Government.&apos;    The WarCabinet thought it important that Marshal Stalin should hear&quot;&apos;or this from us before he heard from Marshal Tito.      The&apos;Foreign Office should therefore prepare at once the draft of a communication to Marshal Stalin comprising a&apos; short -summary&apos;. of the - course of the negotiations- between Field MarshalAlexander ,ahd;Mai stial Tito,  a brief statement ^of policy based

6il&apos;&apos;the&apos; first, /part &quot;of president Truman&apos;s telegram.No. 34 of    ,12th May, and the/text of the communication which&apos; was to&quot; bemade to Marshal &apos; Tito&quot; on behalf of tae Governments of the.United Kingdom and the&apos; United States.&apos;     THE PRIME ministers aid that, he would-.telegraph this draft at once to. president truman and would suggest&apos; that,  subject to his comments,, a communication in these terms should be. made to Marshal Stalinby the -representatives in Moscow of the Governments of theUnited. Kingdom a&apos;nd the United States.(c) It would be necessary to explain the position to theGovernments of South Africa&apos; and New Zealand and to invitethem to agree that their troops now under Field Marshal.Alexander&apos;s command should remain at his disposal for thepurpose of any military operations against Yugoslav troopsif. in the last resort it became necessary to use force to compel them to withdraw from southern Austria and thewestern part of Venezia Giulia.(d) THE PRIMS MINISTER said that he had already informedField Marshal Alexander privately of the text of president truman&apos;s telegram No. 34 of 12th May.-(e) The State Department were about to issue to thePress in Washington a statement on the situation in VeneziaGiulia and southern Austria.      It was desirable that the .  ,Press in London should also have suitable guidance on the.policy which was to be followed by the Governments of theUnited Kingdom and the United States.      The Minister ofState undertook to explain the position to the diplomaticcorrespondents of the Press in London.The War Cabinet - ..,/,(l) Endorsed the action taken &quot;by the Prime minister in despatching forthwith his reply (No. 45&quot;of 12th May)  to President Truman&apos;s telegramNo.  34 of 12th May.(2) Took note that His M-: jesty&apos;s Minister in Belgradehad been instructed to concert with his UnitedStates colleague the delivery to -Marshal Tito of representations on the lines set out in PresidentTrumanrs telegram&apos;No, 34 of 12th May;    and that, ,as regards the exact text and method of delivery of these representations, His Majesty?s minister would conform to instructions received from washington by the United States Minister. - ..(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would telegraph to&apos; President Truman the text of a message to marshal Stalin informing him of the communication which was being made to the Yugoslav Government,and would suggest that this message should be delivered to Marshal Stalin by the representatives in Mobcow of the United Kingdom and United states government.&apos; .(4) Invited the Maniater of State to&apos;arrange forDominion Governments to be informed of the course.,of policy which the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and the United States had agreed tofollow;    and. for the Governments of New Zealand&quot;/.:;&apos;/:    and South Africa to be asked tb agree that their&apos;,troops now under Field Marshal Alexander&apos;command should remain at his disposal for&apos; the&apos; a--    &quot; /      purpose of any military operations&apos;that might   &apos;  &apos;.become necessary in furtherance of this policy.
