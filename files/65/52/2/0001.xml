In his reply, president roosevelt had repudiated this suggestion in strongterms, and had expressed his bitter resentment towardsthe informers who had so vilely misrepresented to marshal Stalin his actions and those of his trustedsubordina tes.THE PRIME MINISTER summarised the course ofthe meetings which had taken place in Switzerland.On the 8th March Field Marshal Alexander had beeninformed by the Office of Strategic Services (a U.S.agency)  that a German General, Karl Wolff, who wasthen proceeding to Switzerland, was willing to discussarrangements for the surrender of the German forces inNorthern Italy.      Field Marshal Alexander had been authorised to send representatives to Berne, for thepurpose of testing the credentials of this emissaryand arranging a meeting in Italy at which the terms,of a military surrender could be negotiated.      TheSoviet Government had at once been informed of this approach.      We had been willing that soviet representatives should be present at the preliminary meeting in Switzerland;    but the U.S.  authorities had&apos;not favoured this, and in any event there would havebeen difficulties in arranging for Russian officers to enter Switzerland, as the Soviet Government werenot in diplomatic relations with the Swiss Government.The Soviet Government had therefore been told thatthey would be kept informed of the course of these meetings;    and had been assured that theirrepresentatives would be enabled to attend any meeting which might subsequently take place in italy to discuss the terms of a military surrender.     The

suspicions of the Russians had been aroused by this&apos;decision not to invite their representative to theBerne meetings;    and on 1 6th March Mi . Moloto-v had sent a letter to H.M. Ambassador in Moscow insistingthat the discussions in Switzerland should be broken off.      In a further letter of 23rd March he  had maintained this attitude, even after it had been explained to him.that the sole purpose of thesecontacts in Switzerland was to arrange a meeting in italy at which Russian representatives would be present.It now appeared that President Roosevelthad held some communications with Marshal Stalin onthis subject,  earlier than those contained in the telegram of 5th April.      We had not previously beenaware of this fact.    It was, however,  clear that weshould support President Roosevelt in hisrepudiation of the suggestion made in marshal stalin&apos;s telegram of 3rd April.&apos; THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet a* draft of a telegram which he proposed, subject totheir views,  to send to Marshal Stalin.In discussion the following amendments of this draft were suggested.(a) The telegram summarised the course of eventsas known to the competent authorities in this country.It was, however, possible that the Office of StrategicServices had taken other action which had not been ,reported to us, and that information about that action had reached the   Russians.      On this account it wouldbe preferable to make it clear,  early in the telegram,that what followed.was a statement of the action takenby H.M.  Government in this matter.(b) There was now some reason to suspect that this approach by General Wolff might have been a ruse,having as its sole purpose the sowing of dissension&apos;between the Allied Governments*  and that the germans had conveyed to the Soviet Government their version of what was taking place.    Iri this connection itmight be significant that in his first telegram onthis subject Field Marshal Alexander had stated:&quot;two of the leading figures on the German side areS.S.  and Himmler men, which makes me very suspicious:  .nevertheless it is as well  to be prepared. &quot;     Itwould be expedient to refer to this possibility inthe telegram to Marshal Stalin, pointing out that ifthis had been the German object it had achieved some success, and referring to this first telegram from field Marshal Alexander, which had been communicatedto the Soviet Government.(c) In making the point that Field MarshalAlexander had full right to accept the surrender ofthe German forces in Italy,  the draft telegram notedthat the Russian Commander in Cburland or N.E.Prussia would similarly have power to arrange forthe local surrender of German forces.in these areas. .It was thought preferable that this comparison shouldbe omitted.

(a) It was also agreed to omit from the telegramany detailed explanation of the reasons why ithad been thought inexpedient to arrange for russian representatives to be present at the meetings in Switzerland.The War Cabinet -(1) Took note that the Prime minister would revise his draft telegram to Marshal Stalin so as to take account of the points noted above and other drafting suggestions madein the course of the discussion,(2) Invited the Prime Minister to despatch the telegram,  as sorevised,  to Marshal Stalin andto send a copy to president roosevelt.(3) Agreed that a full selection ofthe telegrams which had passed onthis subject,  through both military and political channels,should be printed and circulatedto the War Cabinet.Offices of the War Cabinet,S. 11.1,-3-
