MINUTE confidential Annex(3rd April, 1945 -5.30 p.m.)REVIEW OP WORLDSITUATIONTHE PRIME MINISTER welcomed to the War CabinetField Marshal Smuts, Air. Fraser, Mr, Forde, Dr. Evatt,Field Marshal Lord Wavell and Sir Firoz Khan Noon.The Prime Minister said that it was veryfitting that representatives of the Dominions andIndia should meet together at this stage of the war.Recent developments in the world situation had causedhim to reflect upon the future role of the BritishCommonwealth in world affairs,  and he was glad to have this opportunity of discussing these critical issueswith Ministers of Dominion Governments and representatives of. India.     Relations with Russia,which had offered such fair promise at the Crimea conference, had grown less cordial during the ensuingweeks.      There had been grave difficulties over thePolish question;    and it now seemed possible that russia would not be willing to give full co-operation at the San Francisco Conference on the.proposed new world Organisation.      It was by no means clear thatwe could count on Russia as a beneficent influence in Europe, or as a willing partner in maintaining thepeace of the world.     Yet, at the end of the war,Russia would be left in a position of preponderantpower and influence throughout the whole of Europe.In the western hemisphere,  the United States had madeenormous strides during the last two years, and hadbuilt up a mill tar;,&apos; machine and supporting war production which was maintaining a vast military effort, not only in Europe but in the Pacific theatre.The resources in men and material commanded by theUnited States were vastly superior to our own;    andthey had acquired during this war a new capacity and experience in marshalling these resources in war.These were the dominating facts in the world situation.      How could the British Commonwealth, asthe third of the three Great Powers, match the powerand influence which would be wielded after the warby Russia and the United States?     In material sources we could not hope to equal either of these powers.   We could hold our own only by our superiorstatecraft and experience and, above all, by the unity of the British Commonwealth of Nations.     Herejoiced that in spite of the independence rightlyenjoyed by the self-governing members of theCommonwealth, there still remained that strong sense of unity and common purpose through which alon6 wecould maintain the. influence of the BritishCommonwealth as a world power.

FIELD MARSHAL SMUTS agreed that in future themain influence in world &quot;affairs would be exercised by-three great groups - Russia, a great continentalblock now extending its influence into Western Europe,a new world phenomenon, without political background,whose future influence was incalculable;    the north american continent, whose potentialities in world affairs were almost as difficult to predict;    andthe British Commonwealth, strung out along extended and vulnerable lines of communication, but havingbehind it the authority and prestige of its greatrecord in world affairs.     For generations to come thefuture of the world would depend on the balance between these three Great Powers.      The world would need our maturity and experience in world affairs.There were grave dangers in power suddenly acquired,without experience and a mature sense of responsibility,as had been exemplified by the recent history ofGermany and Japan.The Prime Minister had rightly stressed the unity and single purpose of the .British Commonwealth..He feared, however, that spiritual unity would not be enough:    our unity must also be based on a materialfoundation.     And one of the main problems in the ,immediate future would be to safeguard our imperial-communications.      The position had changed radicallysince the last war:    we were no longer the predominantnaval power, and communications no longer restedsolely on sea power.      The future of the world would depend on our being able to pull our weight in&apos;partnership with the two other Great Powers;    but weshould not be able to do that unless we took early and effective action to strengthen our imperial ,communicati ons.MR. FRACER said that he was glad to be in thiscountry again at this crisis of the European war.He had been fortunate to be here at several criticalperiods in the war - in 1939, 19M and again in 19U4on the eve of the Anglo-American landings on theContinent of Europe.As soon as the war in Europe was over we mustturn to finish the war against Japan;    and he was glad that the British Fleet had now been given a chance to participate in active operations against japan.     Vessels of the New Zealand Navy wereaccompanying the British Fleet in those operations.He agreed with what had been said by the PrimeMinister and Field Marshal Smuts about the futurepart of the British Commonwealth in world affairs.He thought that our guiding aim should be to adhere to the principles for which we had declared war;and, in&quot;the Pacific, to maintain friendly relations and co-operation with the United States.MR.  FORDE said that he was glad to have the privilege of joining in a meeting of the War cabinet at No.  10 Downing Street. .   It was from this roomthat the Prime Minister and H.M. Government in the&apos;United Kingdom had given inspiration and leadership,not only to the British Commonwealth but to the whole world, when in 192+0    the Commonwealth had stood aloneagainst the threat of world domination by the Nazis.The people of Australia had a high regard for thebravery and endurance shown by the people of the UnitedKingdom at that critical stage in the world&apos;s history.

The arrival of the British Fleet in the pacific, under the command of Admiral Sir BruceFraser, had brought widespread rejoicing andinspiration to the Australian people.Australia felt a close concern in the futureordering of Commonwealth and. world affairs.      Thetendency towards isolationism which had at one timeshown itself in Australia had now passed.      Thesuccess of international co-operation for war haddemonstrated to the Australian people.the possibilitiesof using the same methods, both within the BritishCommonwealth and among all members of the united nations, for solving the problems of the future whichwere common to all democracies.DR.  EVATT referred to the changes in thewar situation which had occurred since his last visit to this country in 1943.     At that time he had been concerned to obtain from this country a number of fighter aircraft for Australia.       Since then over900 of the most up-to-date Spitfires had been delivered to Australia;    and he wished to take this opportunity of expressing his personal gratitude tothe Prime Minister and the War Cabinet for fulfillingso generously the promises which had then been madeto him.      The war situation, both in the West andthe Pacific theatres, now warranted a feeling ofrestrained optimism.      As regards post-war problems, -he was convinced that, in the Pacific at any rate,no solutions would be found without the closest -co-operation between the British Commonwealth andthe United States of America.THE PRIME MINISTER,  in inviting the viceroy of India to make a statement to the War Cabinet,recalled the nation&apos;s debt to Lord Wavell as amilitary commander.      His successful campaigns in north Africa in 1940 and 1941. conducted with such&quot;bits and pieces&quot; as could be made available to him,had demonstrated at a critical stage in the war thatwe had the power to strike, as well as to defy,  theenemy.FIELD MARSHAL LORD WAVELL said that it was appropriate to remind this meeting of the War Cabinetthat the &quot;bits and pieces&quot; to which the Prime minister had referred had been drawn from almost all parts ofthe British Commonwealth/In his view, India was one of the most urgentof our post-war problems - for two reasons.     First,the prestige and power of the British commonwealth in world affairs after the war would depend verylargely on our having found a solution of theIndian problem.      Secondly, India was in a positionto play an important part in world affairs in theEast.      The magnificent war record of Indian troops,and India&apos;s outstanding contribution to the war effort of the Commonwealth, were evidence of theimportant share which India could take in shoulderingthe burden of responsibility which should be carried&apos;by the British Commonwealth in the post-war years.

SIR FIROZ KHAN NOON said that for the second time India was fighting side &quot;by side with thiscountry and the Dominions in a world war;    and thisbond of common sacrifice would bind India still more .closely to the United Kingdom and the Dominions,The constitutional problem in India was fraught with&apos; . grave difficulties;    but he believed that withclarity of vision and firmness of mind, and above-   all with patience, a solution of those problems,could be found.      Whatever solution might provegenerally acceptable, he had no doubt that there wasno substantial body of political opinion in india which did not favour remaining within a unitedBritish Commonwealth.      When he reflected upon the magnitude&apos; of India&apos;s war effort, he was sometimessurprised that China should be generally regarded asthe fifth of the Great Powers;    and he wondered-whether it might not prove wiser to look to Indiarather than   China to play a leading role in world affairs in the East after the war.San Francisco &apos; In the course of the discussion, referenceConference on was made to the possibility that, in view of the &apos;SjProposed World difficulties which had arisen over the reconstitutionOrganisation of the Polish Government, Russia might decide notto be represented at the forthcoming Conference at san Francisco on the proposed World Organisation.The general view was that, even though Russiawere not represented,  the Conference ought still tobe held.      A very large number of other countries had accepted invitations to the Conference;    and to -cancel the Conference at the last moment, merely because Russia -was unwilling to be represented, would suggest that an undue importance was attached to russian participation in these discussions.    different considerations would of course apply if it becameinadvisable to hold the Conference because of rapiddevelopments in the war situation in Europe.[Message to The representatives of H.M. Government in mr.. W.M. Hughes        Australia referred to the contribution which mr. W.M. Hughes was still making,  though now inhis 81st year,  to the war effort of Australia as amember of the War Committee of the australian government&quot;.      Mr. Hughes had been a member of theImperial War Cabinet during the last war;    and itwas felt that it would be fitting that a message&apos;should be sent to him on behalf of this meeting ofthe War Cabinet, at which so many representativesof Commonwealth Governments were represented.The War Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of the War Cabinetto arraxige for a message of greeting andcongratulation to be sent to Mr.: Hugheson their behalf.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
