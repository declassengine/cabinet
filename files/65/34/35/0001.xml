THE PRIME MINISTER, who had landed in this countryl!earlier that morning^ gave the War Gabinet an account of &apos;:ithe conversations uhich he had held during this stay in Washington and of his subsequent visit to Korth AfriecwyThe following record deals only with the salient-points in his statement.The visit to Washington had been amply 3ustifie&amp;:It had again demonstrated the need for personal exchanges of view at intervals, in order to preserve the harmony of anglo-American co-operation.     Public opinion in theUnited States was much more concerned about the war against Japan - it was almost true to say that theAmerican public would he more disturbed if China fell outof the war than if Russia did so.     Though this was notthe view of the President and the leaders of theAdministration, they could not fail to be influenced tosome extent by public opinion.     At the outset of the      &apos;:htalks there had been a marked difference of opinion between the Staffs.     The American staff were notenthusiastic about operations directed against Italy, and ;were inclined to argue that undue concentration upon in the Mediterranean would delay &quot;Round-Up

While It had &quot;been agreed that our primary object lyein 1943 should he to knock Italy out of the war, we had undertaken to withdraw a certain number of troops atstages from the Mediterranean in order to increase the striking -force available for &quot;Rouna-Up^There had also been some differences of view aboutthe campaign in Burma.     It had eventually been agreedthat there would be no advantage in seeking to open the burma Road until the middle of 1945.     Meanwhile, furtherarrangements would be made to maintain and increase the flow of supplies to China by the air route, which would be actively developed.     At the same time, it was essentialthat more energy and a more offensive spirit should be developed on the Burma front.     We must fight the Japanesewith vigour at all points where they could be engaged.We must devise at once all practicable means for increasing the power of our offensive on this front.The main strategic issues had now been settled in broad outline.     During the last year there had been some change in the balance between the war in Europe and thewar in the Pacific,     Whereas a year ago we had no alternative but to take the line that we must firstsettle with Hitler and leave Japan to be dealt withafterwards, we and the Americans now had sufficientforces at our joint disposal to justify a rather differentview.     It had now become a matter of emphasis, ratherthan a choice.A statement of the broad strategic decisions* reached in the Washington talks had been prepared, withthe assistance of General Marshall, in a form suitablefor communication to Premier Stalin.     Copies of this statement would be circulated to Members of the WarCabinet.

In the course of the discussions at.Washington,it had become clear that General Eisenhower was somewhatdisinclined to concentrate the forthcoming attack againstthe mainland of Italy.     The Prime Minister was strongly of opinion that, if we struck boldly for the main objective, the secondary objectives would fallautomatically into our possession.     He was anxious thatthis view should be impressed on General Eisenhower and,at the conclusion of the Washington talks, he decided,with the President&apos;s full concurrence, to pay a personalvisit to North Africa.     He was fortunate in persuading the President to allow General Marshall to accompany him.This visit had been most successful.     Pull and frankconversations had taken place, at the end of which general Eisenhower had indicated his complete agreementwith the Prime Minister&apos;s view.     Moreover, general marshall, who had not previously been speciallyenthusiastic about operations in the Mediterranean, hadbeen greatly influenced by what he had seen and heard in North Africa and it seemed likely that he would returnto the United States a convinced supporter of the projected operations in this theatre.Generals Alexander and Montgomery, in common withthe other British Commanders in North Africa, were confident of their power to carry through with successthe operations now impending.General Alexander had returned to this country withthe Prime Minister, for a week&apos;s leave. It was desirableon military and other grounds, that his visit to thiscountry should remain secret. The Prime minister suggested, however, that he should attend the meeting ofthe War Cabinet on the following Monday. He could thenspeak to the War Cabinet, in general terms, about theforthcoming campaign;   and Members of the War Cabinet

would have an opportunity of express!ng to him in persontheir appreciation of the outstanding success which hehad already achieved.The Prime Minister said that he had met Dr. Evattin Washington, and had held some satisfactoryconversations with him.     He hoped that he had been ofsome help to Dr. Bvatt in obtaining the aircraft whichthe Australian Government were anxious to obtain fromthe United States.     Dr. Evatt was expected to arrive inthis country in the near future.AFFAIRS The Prime Minister then referred to thenegotiations at Algiers between General de Gaulle andGeneral Giraud.     There had been difficulties in these negotiations, but on the third day everything had been satisfactorily settled.     The Committee of national liberation which had been established was, he thought,a good Committee.     They had all had lunch with him onthe previous day and had been well satisfied with thecourse of events.     Peyrouton had resigned and Nogues hadbeen superseded, but Boisson had been kept on.     these changes were, he thought, sufficient to show the newspirit which animated the Committee of national liberation.-:The Prime Minister thought that the new Committeeshould be recognised as the authority to which armsshould be given, and to which such financial support as was necessary would be accorded.     It would also benecessary to consider whether the new Committee shouldbe recognised as representing France, and, if so, to what extent.     These questions would have to be considered bythe Foreign Office and the State Department.     The PrimeMinister, however, added that he was in favour of^aces&amp;ding a considerable degree of recognition^

The letters of undertaking which had been givento General de Gaulle would also require   to beconsidered and brought under review in the light of the changed circumstances.     This was a matter to be taken up by the Foreign Office.The War Cabinet congratulated the Prime minister on the success of his visit, and thanked him for themost interesting account which he had given.5th June. 1945
