NO GTJlCULATTn-fJ.WJg.(45) 8Srd CONCLUSIONS.9th June, 1943.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, as his colleagues inthe War Cabinet were aware, the suggestion that His majesty the Ring should go to North Africa and visit his troops had been put to them informally some time previously andthey had agreed to accept responsibility for the visit.He now asked his colleagues to confirm that decision and.to agree to The King leaving this country for North africa on Friday night.   The arrangements for the visit were already well in hand.   /The War Cabinet concurred in this course.The question was then raised whether there should bea Council of State.   The view was taken that, even thoughThe King&apos;s absence might not exceed a fortnight, it was desirable to have a Council of State in order to avoid any delay in the transaction of urgent business.The question of publicity was then discussed.THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought that there wouldbe no objection to an announcement being made that The king was in North Africa visiting his armed, forces in that area,as soon as His Majesty had safely arrived.   Thereafter hethought that there should be no further publicity until after The King&apos;s return, arrangements being made, of course for a full account of the visit to be given as soon as HisMajesty had safely reached home.It was pointed out that, to make this effective, itwould be necessary that strong censorship should be exercised not only by the British, but also by the United Statesand French authorities in North Africa.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if it was necessary,he would he willing to send a telegram to ensure that thiswas done.It was also agreed that the Dominions secretary should inform the Dominion Prime Ministers of The Kingesvisit, notification being delayed, for security reasons,until nearer the time   of She King&apos;s departure.ces of the War Cabinet, S.W.I..
