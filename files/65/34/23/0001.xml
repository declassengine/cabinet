Naval, Military and Air Operations. (Previous Reference: W.M. (43) 67th Conclusions, Minute 1.) Air Operations. Home Theatre.



1. The Vice-Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of the week.

Bomber Command had attacked Duisberg, Bochum and Pilsen with diversionary raids on Berlin. The attack on Bochum had been particularly successful. On the previous night an attack, which had been planned for some time, had been made on three of the most important. Dams in the Ruhr. viz., the Mohne Dam, the Eder Dam and the Dam on the River Sorpe. These attacks had been most successful.

The Secretary of State for Air undertook to circulate photographs of this damage to the War Cabinet.

The War Cabinet asked that their congratulations on this operation should be conveyed to the squadron concerned, and to such other persons concerned with the preparations as the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of Aircraft Production, in consultation, might select.

The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security asked that his Ministry might have early information when attacks on such targets were planned, in order to give ample notice to enable preparations to be made against retaliatory actionby the enemy.

United States Air Forces had attacked Kiel, Wilhelmshaven, Emden, the Ford factory at Antwerp and the airframe factory at Meaulte. The attack on Kiel had been particularly successful.

Enemy activity against this country had increased slightly. Besides day attacks on the east coast, East Anglia, sunderland, the South-Eastern Counties and London had been attacked by night. Enemy losses had been 56 destroyed, 13 probably destroyed and 54 damaged. Our losses and been 25 fighter aircraft (our own and United States), 78 aircraft of Bomber and 6 of Coastal Command.



Mediterranean.



In the Mediterranean our strategic bombing had increased. Enemy losses had been 142 (including 46 on the ground). Allied losses had been 29 aircraft. Twenty one large and 31 small enemy vessels had been hit.



Naval Operations.



Shipping losses by enemy action during the previous week, including belated reports, had been 44,165 tons.

A south-bound enemy convoy had been attacked off the Hook of Holland on the 14th May. Two of the escort of four ships had been sunk without loss to ourselves.



Military Operations. Tunisia.



The last stages of the Tunis Campaign were described. The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, contrary to press reports, his information was that the Germans had fought well to the end.



Burma



Our forces in Burma had now withdrawn from Buthidaung and Maungaw. A full report of the reasons for these withdrawals had been asked for.



The War Cabinet-



Took note of these statements.



Russo-Polish Relations. (Previous Reference: W.M. (43) 67th Conclusions. Minute 8.)



2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said there had been no significant development in the Russo-Polish dispute. The Poles seemed disposed to accept our advice to avoid public statements which might be regarded by the Russians as provocative; and, with one exception, the newspapers published in this country had exercised due discretion in handling the matter. The comments in the Daily Worker were, however, a source of irritation to the Poles, and the suggestion had been made that some pressure might be applied to this Newspapers, possibly by giving a warning that by persisting in mischievous comment it ran a risk of being again suppressed.


The Daily     ....Worker:(previous reference erence:W.M. (43) 67thConclusions,Minute 3.)Horth Africa.NationalService, ofThanksgiving.(Previous,Reference:, ...W.M. (43) 68thConclusions,Minute 1.)Resolution of thanks to be moved inParliament.ElectoralMachinery.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 46thConclusions,Minute 5.)The War Cabinet maintained .their view that it Would be inexpedient toi oner any advice to this newspaper: The Minister ofInformation,^ in replying toiaParliamentary;^ on the.following day, to make it clear. that.; facilities. . -for. - the iuexportof the Daily Worker were stillwithheld, and that steps were taken to prevent newspaper represen-tatives from &quot;telegraphing abroad messages which were considered to be prejudicial to the interests of the&apos; United Nations. this statement should help to put into proper perspective the commentsmade by the Daily Worker on the Russo-Polish dispute.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.3. The War Cabinet discussed the arrangements for theNational Service of Thanksgiving to be held on Wednesday, the19th May. It was explained that strong representations had beenmade that some notification should be given to Members of bothHouses of Parliament before the Session on Tuesday, the 18th May.Notices had accordingly been issued on. Saturday through the post.There was now reason to believe that the time and place of theService might have become fairly widely known.On security grounds, the risk that the time and place of theService would become known to the enemy was not one which oughtto be run. It was therefore decided that the time of the service should be altered to the afternoon.The War Cabinet V Conclusions were as follows :* (1) The time of the Service should be altered to the afternoon.Notification of the altered time of the Service shouldbe made in Secret Session in Parliament on thefollowing day.Should there be an Alert during the Service of Thanks-giving, the congregation should remain in the Cathedral,and should not be given an opportunity to leave.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inviteto the Service the Ambassadors of those countries whichhad broken off relations, but not of those still in relations,* with the Axis Powers.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security should consult the Service Ministers as to whether smalldetachments of the Fighting Services should be present at the Service.(5) The draft Resolution of Thanks to be moved in parliament on the following day in the form circulated by the deputy Prime Minister (W.P. (43) 206) was approved.(2)(3)(4)4. The War Cabinet had before them the Report (W.P.(43) 201) of the Ministerial Committee appointed to consider thequestions of policy raised by the Report of the DepartmentalCommittee on Electoral Machinery.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe was being pressed to make an early statement in Parliament on some of the matters dealt with in the Report; but, if the WarCabinet wished that the matter should be deferred until the PrimeMinisters return, he thought that a public statement could be deferred for some weeks. If necessary, the Members who had shown a special interest in these matters might be told privately the reason why final decisions were being held over.&apos; The War Cabinet-       ,    &apos; 1Decided to defer until after the Prime Ministers returni I.: consideration of the issues raised in this Memorandum.
BeiBgees.ArrangementsforParliamentaryDebate.  ;(Previous .Reference:&quot;W.M. (43) 67th-Conclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hewas concerned about the statements which were likely to be made;in the forthcoming rDeDate in the House of Commons on refugees,about the facilities for refugees to escape from Nazi oppressionthrough Spain. There had beep some public &quot;discussion of theproposal to facilitate the transfer of Jewish refugees to Palestinethrough Bulgaria,. Apparently as a result of this discussion, theGermans had now taken ^special steps to prevent refugees from leaving Bulgaria. If there were now similar discussion aboutSpain, there was a danger that the Germans might take, similar action to close the Spanish channels through which refugees andothers escaped.The War Cabinet considered whether it would be expedient inthese circumstances that the Debate on refugees should be held in secret Session. It was thought, however, that the preferable coursewould be for the Secretary of State&apos;for&apos; Foreign Affairs to take theopportunity, when the House went into Secret Session on thefollowing day for the purpose of the announcement regarding theNational Service of Thanksgiving for the-victory in Africa, toinform the House of the action taken by the Germans in respect ofthe transfer of refugees through Bulgaria, and to warn Membersof the importance of avoiding any statement in the course of theforthcoming Debate on refugees which might lead to similar action being taken in respect of Spain. .      -The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to dealwith the matter on these lines in the course of his statement on Business while the House was in Secret Session on the-        following day.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,May 17, 1943.
