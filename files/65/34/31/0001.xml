The Homfc Secretary-arid Minister of Home Security urged-thatthe public had already become used to hearing the bells rung not asah alarm signalv  He, therefore, r oonunended; that the presentrestriction shollld now be removed ahd: thatpublicity should be given\ to this; decision:   The effectof such^^of Church bells ansloth^b^ for any purposeat any time, provided that their sound Would not be liable to bemistaken for &quot;a signal ... . to indicate that an air raid by theenemy is expected or is in progress,or has ceased, or that noxiousgas is present or that danger from such gas has ceased &apos;&apos; (Control ofNoise (Defence) (No. 2),Order, 1939).. The War Cabinet-. .       N&apos;&apos;Approved this proposal, and authorised the HomeSecretary and; minister of ;Home Security to take thenecessary steps to give effect to it, and to make an ahnourice-ment in reply to a Parliamentary Question.        *Parliament.. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that severalAbolition of the Members of Parliament were likely to urge that some statementComintern.       should be made on behalf of the Government on this matter.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should make a statement on the following day in reply to aPrivate Notice Question, and that the reply should be ofa purely factual nature. Thus, it should be pointed outthat the Comintern had always been an internationalpolitical organisation for which the Soviet Government haddisclaimed responsibility; reference should also be made tothe provision in the Anglo-Soviet Treaty whereby both governments had undertaken not to interfere in theinternal affairs of other States.[Note.--After the meeting of the War Cabinet, it was. decided that a statement on the lines indicated above should be drafted and held in readiness for use in theevent of a Member, putting down a question on the subject,but that there was no need to arrange for a Private notice question.](Previous,Reference:W.M. (43) 75thConclusions,Minute 2.)ParliamentAir Transport.(previous reference:W,M, (43) 36thCotidlusionsT;,   &apos;Minute 8.)5 The War Cabinet were reminded that, following a Meetingof Ministers with the Dominion High Commissioners (or then-representatives), a telegram had been, sent to the Dominion Govern-ments on the 7th April asking whether they were willing to 30mwith us in an approach to the United States Government, advocatingfull internationalisation after the war of all air transport services.Replies had been received from two Dominions, but replies from tneothers were outstanding. Meanwhile, there Was increasing pressure for the matter to be debated in Parliament, and for a further state-ment to be made as to the present position by a government spokesman.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that this matter might be discussed on Tuesday,,y0&apos;-.. ist June, in the Debate on the Consolidated Fund Bill.(2) Agreed that there should be a furthei? Meeting of thead hocMinisterial Cohuhittee on Civil Aviation in the course ofthe next few days,&quot;,td discuss: hovV bestfurther progress could be made in this matter; who should be the Govern-mentsp^k^s^^
63 W*M* 77 (48).6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had had a letter from Miss Rathbone, M.P., suggesting that the Govern-ment might be able to say more in private about the recent conference on Refugees than it had been possible for them to say we the public debate on the 19th May, and asking whether he would receive for this purpose a deputation of Members of both Houses ofParliament. It was difficult for him, as leader of the House, torefuse to see Members of Parliament, but there was little more that could be said at this stage in view of our understanding with theUnited States Government that decisions resulting from theConference would not be disclosed in independent announcementsby either of the two Governments.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that it was unreasonable that a request for a deputation to be received shouldbe made so soon after the matter had been fully debated in Parlia-ment. The best line for the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs to take would probably be to suggest that the deputation should atleast be postponed until Mr. Law had returned to this country.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
