(1) A Joint Memorandum, by the Secretary of State for-t-: Dominion Affairs and the; President of the Board ofTrade (W.P: (43)136). To this was,annexed (a) a Note-, .    by the&apos;President of the Board of Trade and (6) a draft,telegram to tfo(2) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (43) 143). - /The Memorandum by the President of \ the Board of Tradesummarised ; the three views held among the Ministers chiefly concerned. View A was&apos; that;a&apos; general clearance of Carriers towOtld trade was particularly in the interest of this country.Without it we could not hope; for full employment in our export,trade. Such a clearance could best be secured by a multilateralcommercial convention open to adherence by all States. Under the-convention tariffs should be restricted to a moderate level,preferences substantially reduced, export subsidies prohibited, state trading regulated so as to avoid discrimination or excessive protec-tion, and quantitative import restrictions only permitted within,strictly denned limits, There should, however, be an interim,post-war period during which these restrictions might continue ona diminishing scale, and thereafter they should only be used forcertain agreed purposes, disputed cases being settled by a suitableinternational authority. It was proposed that we should take theinitiative in proposing such a plan to the United States and to the.other United Nations;View B&apos;favoured a single multilateral rather than a bunch of&quot;bilateral agreements. We should not, however, bind ourselves toany limitations on the use of quantitative import restrictions whichmight be vital to the maintenance of our balance of payments,,though We should relax them gradually. We should do our best toset up and strengthen an international commercial organisation, but should not at this stage give it the right to determine or passjudgment on our own commercial policy.According to View C, quantitative import restrictions were,quite apart from the balance of payments, a sound and permanentinstrument of national planning. Bilateral treaties gave better-results than attempts at multilateral arrangements, and a general reduction of trade barriers, even if practicable, would not necessarily be of benefit to this country. Furthermore, it would be a mistakefor us to take the initiative in this matter and make proposals to-the United States.The War Cabinet had a long discussion, covering the chieffeatures of the scheme proposed and the objections raised to it.The main trends of this discussion are set out in the following-record : Quantitative Import Restrictions.View C,The development of these restrictions in the ten years before-the war was discussed. It was urged that in this period we hadoften had recourse, with advantage, to the method of quantitative-restrictions in the Conunercial Treaties negotiated with othercountries; and that, had not our hands been tied by adherence tothe Most-favoured-nation Clause, these negotiations might haveconferred even greater benefits on the trade of this country.Moreover, we might,; after the war, well wish to apply import restrictions to certain agricultural commodities in order to secure-stability for United Kingdom agriculture.On the other hand, it was argued that quantitative restrictions;had ihfjicted much more injury on our export trade than hightariffs. If we insisted on retaining the right to impose these restrictions as a permanent measure, other countries would do thesame, but would probably use this method far less widely than weshould; There were many countries:in.Europe which would be faced--^:.:v- b 2
^protecting;hew industries)&apos; ^THfelaknce of- opinion in fcbetWar Cabinet being shown to be against View 0, discussion -then turned on a comparison betweenViews A and B.     - ; - &quot;Differences between Views A and i?, -The niainyidiffer^ice between these&quot;. two- views. Was as. follows-:,According,to View Ai- ouantitative,import restrictions would.be permissible to any Government for the first two years after the war,provided they were applied in an editable-and nonrdiscriminatorymanner. Thereafter, all Governments signing the Convention wouldhe: under an obligation to remove ifiheir restrictions by progressivesteps over, say,,three years, subject-to- , i(a) exceptions on very limited grounds, 0.^., grounds of health or action in respect of reeognised international com-commodity agreements; or(6) permission from an international monetary authority tomaintain them on the ground of the existing orprospective state of the country&apos;s balance of payments.Should we be wise to surrender to an international authority theright to determine whether, after a limited interim period, weshould be allowed to impose quantitative import restrictions? or should we (as the adherents of; View B proposed) refuse at thisstage to bind ourselves, to any limitations on the use of quantitativeimport restrictions, although expressing the hope that we should beable to relax them gradually? -Looking at the matter from a rather different point of view, itwas suggested that, while there would be general, agreement thatour long-term aim should be a multilateral Convention on the linesof View A, the real point of difference concerned the best approach to this goal. Shortage of foreign balances would compel us to applyquantitative restrictions of imports in the transitional period afterthe war. The first step was therefore to concentrate on the estab-lishment of an International Clearing Union, and to insist on maintaining our right to apply quantitative import restrictions fora period, possibly about five years, during which we should hope to restore our balance of trade.The suggestion was made in discussion, that View A would meet with general acceptance if it were amended so as to preserve the freedom of a country to maintain quantitative import restric-tions without obtaining the permission of an international monetaryauthority if it could be shown that the country had an adverse balance of payments.This view met with general support, and it was agreed that asolution should be sought on these lines.Summing up this part of the discussion the Prime ministers aid that we should open our negotiations on broad general principles, &quot;stating that we favoured the abolition of barriers to international trade, and an expansionist commercial policy. while we:&apos;sliduld&apos;hayeVfe&apos;re^ period during which we Were seeking to restore our balance of trade in the^disordered conditions immediately &quot;following the end of the war, we hoped that wea thistransitional&quot;stage Without undue delay.Probable attitude of United States Government..It was recognised that the; reaction of&apos; the United states authorities to these proposals&apos; was pirbblematical. In some officialquarters in the United States there was a strong determination tohreak ithrougli^ any discussions with the Americans&apos;on commercial policy, we must expect strong criticism of ^the; principle1 of Imperial Preference, a - On the otherhand, American commercial; interests were likely to be ^attracted by
the VicerPresident-s plans for the expansion of American capital development throughout the world; and this policy would be.more;in: accord with a system for regulating -international trade bymultilateral agreement.It was. the general view of; the War Cabinet that there would beno advantage in opening detailed discussions on commercial policy with the United States Administration until there had beenpreliminary consultations at a high level with a viewto ascertaining the general attitude with which the United. States Government were likely to approach these questions. &apos;Procedure vis-a-vis Dominion Governments.It was suggested that, before any such approach was made to theUnited States Government, we should first ascertain the views o.fDominion Governments. It had originally been suggested that the issues should be fully stated to Dominion Governments in the termsof the draft telegram reproduced in Appendix &quot;B&quot; of w.P. (43) 136. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat on further reflection he was doubtful whether long-rangeconsultation by telegraph would be effective, and the course whichhe now recommended was that Dominion Governments should beinvited to send experts to London to confer here upon the whole matter. He believed that we should be in a stronger position in our approach to the United States if we could speak on behalf of theBritish Commonwealth as a whole.On the other hand, it was suggested that there might be con-siderable delay if we had to secure agreement between all theDominions before holding any discussions with the United States.There was no reason why we should not hold a purely provisionalinterchange of views with the United States before these matters had been discussed at length with Dominion Governments. Itwould not be inconsistent with this plan to invite the Dominionsmeanwhile to send experts to London for further discussion.The War Cabinet-I. Recorded a provisional conclusion in favour of taking theinitiative in putting forward proposals on the lines ofView A in W.P. (43) 136, as modified by the suggestionat &quot;X.&quot; &apos;II.   Appointed a Committee composed of 1Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),Minister of Production,Secretary of State for the Colonies,Minister of Aircraft Production,President of the Board of Trade,Paymaster-General,Secretary, Department of Overseas Trade,to consider, and report further to the War Cabinet (a) How the proposals described as View A might be modified  in order  to  take  account  of  thesuggestion recorded at &quot; X,&quot; and how the general objectives of these proposals could best be pre-sented.  This would include the linkage betweenthe scheme for a Commercial Union, the plans foran International Clearing Union, and the Inter-national regulation of primary products.(6) What procedure, and time-table, should be followed in arranging for the discussion of this plan withthe Governments of the Dominions, the UnitedStates and the other United Nations.- The Committee would, of course; consult the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs on II (b) of their reference.
.&apos;;.&apos; 2.   The War ^Cabinet hadjih^^ Memorandum by theMinister without Portfolio ^W.P. (43) 97) *^ereag:ia Report by theCommittee on Reconstruction Problems on the international regulation of Primary Products. -The Report described a scheme for the establishment of inter-national commodity controls of primary products, or groups ofallied primary products, with the function of steadying prices and holding buffer stocks, With a view to maintaining a stable level ofgeneral prices and controlling the trade cycle.It was explained that this scheme had already been discussed with experts from the Dominions, and it was now desired tocommunicate it to Dominion High Commissioners for the] informa-tidn of their Governments. \ft was also suggested that our delegates at the forthcoming3?ood Conference in the United States should; be authorised to refer to this scheme; if need arose, as one which his Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had under consideration, but to which they were in no way committed.In discussion, it was suggested that the scheme was not yet ina form suitable for communication to the United States Government.In particular, the Report failed to make it clear that the scheme forthe creation of buffer stocks would not work effectively unless therewere international regulation of primary production. Thesuggestion was made that the scheme might be considered furtherby the Committee which had been appointed (see preceding Minute)to consider the problem of post-war commercial policy.   &apos;The War Cabinet-1 (1) Agreed that the. proposals put forward tin the report annexed to W.P. (43) .97 might now be communicatedto Dominion High Commissioners for the informationof their Governments.* (2) Agreed that these proposals might, if fseed arose, be mentioned by our delegates at the Food Conference as.a scheme to which His Majesty s &quot;Government had given some consideration but were in no way committed.(3) Asked the Committee on Post-War Commercial Policy toconsider this sdheme in connection with their review ofother proposals, relating to post-war external economicOffices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,April 9, 1943.
