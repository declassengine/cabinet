3W.M. 63(43);Sir RamaBt?aml 1. The Prime Minister said that Sir Ramaswami MudaliarMudaliar. . hadbeen asked bythe Viceroytoreturn to India to become member for Supply in the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council. Hecongratulated Sir Ramaswami, on behalf of the War Cabinet, ontaking over an appointment of such importance to Tndia&apos;s great, contribution to the war. At the same time, he expressed the WarCabinet&apos;s regret that Sir Ramaswami must shortly leave thiscountry to take up his new appointment. They had greatlyappreciated the valuable counsel and advice which he had givenwhile he had been in this country as a representative of India at theWar Cabinet.The War Cabinet-Warmly endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M.

The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theweek.The operations of Bomber Command had been limited by bad weather. The only major raid had been on Essen, but in three nights 1,100 sea-mines had been laid. 1&apos;During April our home-based bombers had dropped a total of11,180 tons of bombs, of Which 9,600 tons had been dropped on targets in Germany, This represented about 10 per,cent, of thetotal tonnage of bombs dropped on Germany throughout the war.Coastal Command had made 21 attacks on U-boats, several ofwhich had been promising. There were indications that U-boats were beginning to fight back from the surface against air attack;this development was likely to prove expensive for the U-boats.Aircraft operating over France in daylight on Saturday, the1st May, had experienced difficulties through an unexpected changein weather conditions; and a formation of United States Fortresseshad suffered heavy losses over Brest.Enemy losses for the week had been 11 destroyed, 2 probably destroyed and 6 damaged. Our losses had been 37 bombers,10 fighters and 8 Coastal Command aircraft.In the Mediterranean theatre the Allies had flown 10,200sorties, as against an estimated total of 2,200 enemy sorties. our air activity had been concentrated mainly against shipping in theSicilian Channel. Enemy losses were 109 destroyed, 14 probably destroyed and 65 damaged. Our losses had been 75 destroyed and54 damaged. .&quot;Shipping losses by enemy action during the previous week hadbeen 80,000 tons. Of this, 47,000 tons had been lost in April andthe remainder in May.For the month of April the latest estimate of losses by enemy action was 281,000 tons, which might rise to a maximum (includinglosses by marine risk) of 365,000 tons.Seven ships, totalling 38,000 tons, had been sunk in a convoy off Freetown. Owing to heavy commitments in other directions,this convoy had only been lightly protected by naval escorts. Theaircraft which had been accompanying the convoy had been diverted to search for another U-boat&quot; reported in the vicinity, and onreturning had been unable to locate the convoy on account of an exceptionally heavy electric storm.The War Cabinet were informed of the arrangements made for reinforcing the convoy protection, in this area.The Prime Minister asked that a report should be made tohim on the arrangements for providing air protection for thisparticular convoy, and generally for convoys in this area andin thei Mediterranean, where two of our ships had been sunk byan air-attack at dusk.: &quot;..

Thoughthe gains in ground had not been very extensive, heavy casualties had been inflicted on the enemy. The French Forces had improvedtheir positions, both in the north and in the centre; and advancesof tactical importance had been made at several points by the FirstArmy, which was now bearing the brunt of the fighting.On the Russian front there was little to report, but the groundhad dried and&apos;a renewal of activity might be expected.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Basso-PolishRelations.(previous reference:  .W.M. (48);62nd*Cpnglu8ions.)3. The Secretary.- of. State .for &apos;F-ormgn/.Aftmrg:.8&amp;(L-&apos;iM&amp; therewas rather less tension between Russia and Poland. He thoughtit was fairly clear that the Soviet Government did not intend tosetup an alternative Polish Government. Moreover, there were variousminor indications of an improvement in the position. Thus, theRussians had agreed to postponement of the date of the, departure of the Polish Embassy from Kuibyshev.Attention Was also drawn to the terms of Premier Stalin&apos;sspeech On the 1st May, copies-of Which had been circulated to theWar Cabinet (W.P. (43) 190). This showed that the Russians were anxious to cultivate good relations with Us.The Secretary of State, for Foreign Affairs said that it was tobe hoped that the breach between Poland and the Soviet Unionmight be healed before too long, possibly after certain changes hadbeen made in the Polish Government. It was to be hoped, too, thatany settlement reached would result in better treatment beingaccorded to the iPoles in the Soviet union the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also drew attentionto one fact which might be significant,,viz., that none of the attackswhich had been made on Poles by name from the Russian side hadbeen against members of General Sikorski&apos;s Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added that anumberof Parliamentary Questions had been addressed to him onthis subject for answer on Wednesday. He proposed to make ashort statement in Parliament on Tuesday, deprecating&apos; discussion,of this matier, andto deal with the Parliamentary Questions by reference to this statement;The War Cabinet Approved the course proposed.        NFolamiiProtection of polish interests.in the&apos; soviet union.A. The Secretary-&apos;of Spate,-for: Foreign Affairs- said -that thePolish &quot;Government had asked us to undertake protection-of their interests in the-Soviet Union. He had replied that, as we proposedto devote ourselves io finding a-, way-out of the Soviet-Polish dead-lock, it would be difficult for us to protect the interests of one partyintheo^ ,;&apos;&apos;.&apos;:;&apos;--;:-&apos;/&apos;:-&apos;-&quot;&apos;.&apos;. .The Polish Government had then approached the United StatesGovernment, but, meeting with no success, had again asked us toact for them, saying that there was no other member of the UnitedMaiioms which could adequately fulfil fihis&apos;jiuty.&amp;!-ipB::?$SU:v::*::.-\cr::^.r^
... The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadtelegraphedto Lord Halifax, asking, him to make a strong appealto Mr. Hull on the grounds that, having regard to the part whichwe were taking in seeking to solve the deadlock, protection of thePolish interests in the Soviet Union would place a very heavy strainupon our relations with Russia. The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs asked the War Cabinet for guidance as to what action should be taken if the United States again refused. The suggestions were made that the Dutch or the Norwegian, or possibly theCanadian Government might be asked to undertake this duty, butthat, failing any other suitable, alternative, among the united nations? we should not altogether exclude having to undertake itourselves.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals made by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, viz., that we should continue to press the United States Government to undertake the protec-tion of Polish interests in the Soviet Union, and, failing this, should explore the possibility of arranging for someother member of the United Nations to undertake thetask. .(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to sound the Canadian Government as to their willingness to undertake this duty, if no other suitable arrangementcould be made.The Blockade.Proposed joint anglo-AmericanExamination of.Eelief Problem,(PreviousKeference:W.M. (42) 71stConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Economic Warfare (W.P. (43) 186).The Minister had had two discussions with Governor Lehman,Director of the United States Office of Foreign Relief and rehabilitation-tation Operations, now in London, summarised in Annex &quot; A &quot; tohis Memorandum. In the light of these discussions, and in viewof the danger that if we adopted an entirely negative attitude the americans might act on their own, the Minister sought the approvalof the War Cabinet to a joint examination, in Washington, of thepractical possibilities, from the point of view of supply, shipping and control of distribution, of sending relief to Occupied Europeif it were decided to modify existing policy.It was contemplated that any scheme of relief would be eonfmedto children; and possibly to expectant and nursing mothers, incertain specified big cities in Europe.The-Minister of Economic Warfare explained that from histalks with Governor Lehman he was convinced that, with the generaldeterioration of conditions in Europe, we should not be able to hold the present position beyond Christmas. Moreover, there was a con-siderable risk that, unless we undertook a joint examination of thematter with United States representatives, the United StatesGovernment might pledge themselves to a concession in regard tosome particular country, which might well have many unfortunateconsequences for the blockade. At the same time, he.realised thatexamination of the matter would almost certainly show that verylittle could in practice be done.The following were the main points made in discussion :-(1) It had long been argued that we, should have to make some concession to meet the pressure to allow^limited quantities of foodstuffs through the blockade for therelief of childreri in occupied territories. Nevertheless,we had been.able to refuse all concessions except as&quot;v&apos;-./. ?;&apos; regards Greece. .. :.fi&apos;   , .,(2) Once a concession-however limited-had been made, there&apos; would be no firm ground on which we could resistextensions of it.
(3) In fact fcttle, lf-arn^ food could ,bg made; available for relief of occupied territories in, Europe except at theexpense of oprselves or the ^^^a^^mt^-boldi^put expectations that relief could he&apos;afforded we shouldate-act drifoqjsms; based ion the limited ^ount of reliefwhachQpuld be made available.M $$tP$^$TOshP?tlyhe improved bAH the harvest, andthere, could therefore he no speeia^ge^ey in discussingwhat the^position&apos; was likely to be-in the followingwinter!,(5) Qn the^other hand, emphasis was laid on the risk that theUnited States might take action in this matter without. prior consultation with us.       *The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send a telegram to our Ambassador at Washington, informingh\m that our policy in, this matter was unchanged; andttiat We should he glad if he would take a suitable opportunity of ^nfqrniing the United States authorities- ttia^jCanyeuggestjons. for relief in occupied territories should^come up for consideration, we should wish to betaken iWly into consultation before any commitments wereentered into.QMcesaf t&amp;e War Cabinet, S.W.
