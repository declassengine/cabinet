1. &quot; the-. War Cabinet had before them a- Memorandum cir-culated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (DO. (43) 10).A record of the discussion, which was of a preliminary nature and was adjourned to the following dayf- is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet; Conclusions.2. The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by $heSecretary of State for India (W.P. (43) 197 and 208) on attemptsbeing made to subvert the loyalty of the Indian Army.The Secretary of State for India emphasised that the firstpaper dealt mainly with possible dangers, and was not a statementof any bad situation that had arisen. This was confirmed by the- letter from General Headquarters, India, quoted in his secondpaper/Generally speaking, the Indian Army had not been affectedby Congress activities; but Indian soldiers were concerned by theincreased cost of living and the effect it might have on their families.&apos;There was ho cause for undue alarm, but continued watchfulnesswas necessary.      - ,Nevertheless, it was clear that expansion of the Indian army should now cease. The target had recently been reduced from17 infantry and 3 armoured divisions to 15 infantry and2 armoured, exclusive of frontier defence and internal security.These divisions were not yet complete and some non-divisional troops were still required. He considered that we should now stand on this target, concentrating on 15 divisions plus ancillary troops, at thesame time weeding out weak elements.As regards the measures which could be taken to counteract theuneasiness in the Indian Army, the Secretary of State felt that anincrease of pay was the most promising. Sepoys&apos; pay had recentlybeen increased, but it was still low, amounting to Rs. 24  a month.This included deferred and proficiency pay! Troops on serviceeast of the Brahmaputra received Rs. 5 extra and on service overseas Rs. 7 extra. In spite of the danger of inflation, an increasein pay would bring substantial benefit to the Indian soldiers&apos;families. He would like to go into this further with the authoritiesin India.The Minister of Aircraft Production agreed that thequestion of pay should be dealt with, and suggested that fieldservice allowances should be the same, whether on the Burmesefrontier or overseas.- The question was raised whether the Royal Indian Navy and indian Air Force personnel were equally affected.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, as far as he knew,there had been no unrest in the Royal Indian Navy. They had avery fine record, but he felt that,&apos; if there were to be an increase of pay, they should be kept in mind. It might be desirable to obtain areport as to whether the R.I.N. had been affected by uneasiness. -It was pointed out that 20 per cent, of the R.A.F. personnel inIndia Were Indians, but these were on the same scale as Britishranks. &quot;The War Cabinet-&apos;(a) Agreed that the present target for the Indian Army of15 infantry and;2 armoured divisions, complete withancillary troops, should be adhered-to and completed,but.should not be exceeded.(b) Took note that the Secretary of State for India would; enquirei the Viceroy&apos;s views as to a possible increase inthe pay of Indian ranks, and would also consult further. (  with Field-Marshal Wayell on his return from theUnited States. *t
(c) Invited the Secretaryof State for Indiato^^enqwire whether there was any uneasiness in the Royal Indian Navy, and*    whether any proposals for increases of pay should alsobe applicable to that Service.. ;   &apos;Royal Nasy. 3.
