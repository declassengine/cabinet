1.. T^e War Cabinet had be^^of War&apos;Transport (W.P. (43), 141) reconimenaing that no additional ships should be allocated in the United Kingdom or,&apos;North America for loading goods for Turkey until ships could be passed through the Mediterranean. In the meanwhile, as muchmaterial as possible should be sent to Turkey from the Middle East:In discussion, the policy recommended bythe Minister of war transport was generally supported, though it was pointed out thatthe material accumulated in the Middle East would not furnish a balanced supply of the goods which the Turks most wanted. In-particiilar, supplies of vehicles and gun tractorjs were riot availablein the Middle East. Doubt was also expressed as to the quantityof military supplies available there. It was known that there were22,000 tons of military stores earmarked since the AdanaConference, and information in the possession of the Minister ofWar -Transport led him to suppose that there were a further63,000 tons previously accumulated, and 35,000 tons on the way tothe Middle East--making a total of 120,000 tons in all:The Secretary of State for War and the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury doubted whether so large a quantity of military stores had been accumulated:The Prime Minister thought it would be wrong to send anyfurther ships with supplies to Turkey round the Cape. The doubt as to what quantities of supplies were available in the Middle Eastshould be cleared up immediately. If there were special items badly needed by the Turks, the Army in Egypt: should be instructed toprovide them from their reserves, the quantity being made goodthrough the Mediterranean later on. He certainly thought thatthe Army should spare some vehicles^ of Which there must be largenumbers in Egypt now that the long road haul from the Delta toBenghazi was no longer required.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that no further ships should be allocated in theUnited Kingdom or North America for loading goods.. for Turkey via the Cape.(2) Invited the Allied Supplies Executive (a) To report the quantity and type of military and civilstores which were available in the Middle Eastfor shipment to Turkey in April, May and June.(b) To investigate and report what could be done inthese three months to provide from our resources in the Middle East and Persia/Iraq Commandsvehicles, tractors, or any other special items ofwhich the Turks stood in particular need, andwhich were not available in the stocks at presentearmarked for them.(c) To make all arrangements so that high prioritystores could be shipped to Turkey through theMediterranean as soon as possible after theopening of that route..The Budget. 2.. The. Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to the(Previous      War Cabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcomingBef erence:        Budget.W.M.(42)46th .

/Ministers^(^teiiBj and Country Planning being given adequate,statutory/powers in theDevelopment) proposed Bill to compel recalcitrant, obstructive or inert CountyBilJ. authorities to do ;what was necessary in the larger interest.   He(Previous       had asked that this point should be further examined.Reference: The Lord President of the-Council saidthat &apos;he/-had consultedw.M443)49th with the Minister of Town and Country Planning, and was satisfiedConclusions, that the Minister&apos;s existing statutory powers, as strengthened by minute 2.) the present Bill, would enable him to compel Planning authoritiesto prevent development contrary to national interests. The minister would be able to compel the preparation, modification and enforce-ment of Planning schemes; and to combine twO or mbr  planning authorities into a Joint Authority when he thought necessary. Hewould also be able to control interim development, where thenational interest was affected, because (i) he might require any development application to be referred to him for decision; (ii) ifthe Planning authority had given permission for development whichin his opinion &quot;ought not to be carried out, he might have thatpermission revoked; and (iii) if development was carried out without permission, he might require the authority to remove oralter it. It was true that the Minister would not have all the powersrequired to compel Planning authorities to carry out development.This/however, involved a re-casting of the present legislation, andwould more appropriately form part of wider legislative proposals at a later stage.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,April 9, 1943.
