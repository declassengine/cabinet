(43) 251);The Prime Minister (W.P. (43) 257);The Parliamentary Under-Seeretary of State for Air(W.P. (43) 259); andThe Secretary of State for India (W.P. (43) 262).The following were the main points dealt with in discussion : (a) The Canadian Government had replied to our. proposalsfor preliminary Commonwealth discussions on post-war civilaviation by suggesting a Conference at Ottawa, which would alsobe attended by representatives of the United States Government.The War Cabinet took the view that we should accept this proposal. in principle, provided it was made clear that the Conference could. not be held without representation of the U.S.S.R.(6) The question had been raised whether Ministers should.take part in this Conference, or whether it should be at the Official level.The War Cabinet took the view that the Conference must be on the ministerial level.    :(c) It was agreed that we should strongly rebut the suggestion of the Canadian Government that objection could properly be raised to preliminary consultation between members of the BritishCommonwealth before international discussions with Othercountries. In this particular case it Was of the utmost importance that there should be such preliminary discussion, having regard;for example, to the attitude -which the United States authorities had taken in respect of shipping and air communications in the pacific, in which Australia and New Zealand were interested. Itshould therefore be made clear to the Canadian Government that we felt it essential that such preliminary Commonwealth discussions should take place, and that we would propose to. hold such discussions with the other Dominions even if Canada did not seeher way to attend.Whether such preliminary Commonwealth discussions tookplace at Ottawa or elsewhere, and,- indeed, where the Conferenceitself should be held, would depend on the attitude of the canadian government when our position in the matter was explained to them.(d) Discussion then turned on the proposals which the UnitedKingdom Government might support at the proposed Conferenceand which might be communicated to the Dominions. The basis ofthis discussion was Annex &quot; C &quot; to the Memorandum by theMinister without Portfolio (W.P. (43) 251), and the proposals inthe Memorandum by the Prime Minister (W.P. (43) 257).(e) The Secretary of State for India amplified the proposal inhis Memorandum (W-P. (43) 262) that we should advocate from the outset a more extended definition of &quot; Freedom of the Air &quot; by including the right to embark, as well as disembark, passengers,mails and freight destined for and from all destinations, subject tothe reservation of internal traffic and to the right of two or moresignatories tq, combine their territories for the purposes of suchreservation.The general view of the War Cabinet was that this right would normally be secured by bilateral agreements between the countries concerned. The object of the proposed statement was to set out the framework within which these agreements should be negotiated, ahdthe rights which would subsist in the absence of such agreements.(f) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security wishedthat it had been possible for us to put forward proposals for interrnationalisation, in order that it might be clear that the oppositionto such proposals did not come from us. It was explained, however,that the Dominions were not prepared to support a scheme of fullinternationalisation.[25851]B 2
(g) Furthermore, itwas pointed out that Annex &quot; C * includedproposals for the establishment of international operating agencieson particular routes or in particular areas, especially in the case of services now operated by enemy lines in Europe and in the Far Bast.: The: Secretary of/Stake for Foreign Affairs attached importanceto our statement of bur proposals being so drafted as to lay emphasis on the proposal that the European services (outside the U.S.S.R.)should be run by an international operating agency. This, hethought, was significant in relation to the position of the enemyPowers, who would presumably not be allowed to run civil aviationservices after the war.(/*) The: view was expressed that it was doubtful whether theStates of Europe would agree to air transport in Europe being administered by a single iriternational operating organisation; andthat many countries would, after at any rate a short time, insist onrunning their own internal services and making such mutualarrangements as suited them.The general view of the War Cabinet was, however, that mostof the countries concerned were too small to permit of the economicoperation of separate internal air services, and that, in any case,the countries of Europe would be in such need of assistance that inpractice there would be little difficulty in obtaining acceptance ofa scheme on the lines proposed if agreed between the Great Powers^(i) In this connection is was pointed out that paragraph -2 (viii).of Annex C&quot; stated thd,t all States should be responsible for theprovision of the ground facilities needed in their territories. this statement would require qualification in . regard to ex-enemy territories, where such facilities should be administered and controlled internationally.(7) Agreement was expressed with the proposals in theMemorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forAir (W.P. (43) 259), namely:-(i) That our proposals for the &quot; Freedom of the Air&quot;were conditional upon the general acceptance of anenlightened international settlement on the lines pro-posed in Annex &quot; C &quot; to the Memorandum by theMinister without Portfolio. .(ii) That agreements on rates and frequency reached by theproposed Operators&apos; Conference should be subject toendorsement by the proposed international authority.(iii) That facilities should be denied to any air line which,ignored the rules laid down by the Operators&apos; Con-ference and endorsed by the international authority.(k) Discussion took place on the suggestion in the Memorandumby the Prime Minister that an endeavour should be made toascertain what subsidies were. being received by operatingcompanies, and that, if this proved practicable, there might be acondition that no subsidised air line (or rio line subsidised beyondan agreed general minimum) could of right take &quot;up or set downpassengers or .freight in another country&apos;s territory.The general view of the War Cabinet&apos; was that it would be impracticable to base the proposed scheme for the control of post-war civil air transport on ascertainment of the rate of subsidiespaid to particular companies in respect of particular services. Theright course was to concentrate, as proposed in Annex &quot; C,&quot; on the regulation by agreement of the frequency of services, the standardof accommodation and the rates of carriage, &amp;c.(/) Further discussion on this aspect of the matter led to thesuggestion, which met, with general approval, that the regulationof the frequency of services should also carry with it the fixing ofquotas as to the volume of air transport, services (other than purelyinternal services) to be run by each country.
The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : &apos;(1) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should arrangefor the necessary communications to be sent to give effectto the foUowing decisions :-(a) We were willing; to agree that a Conference on thelines proposed should be held, attended by repre-sentatives of ourselves, the Dominions and theTJnited States Government, provided that-(i) representatives of the U.S.S.R. Were alsoinvited to attend;(ii) the Conference was preceded by preliminary.,      consultation   between   members   of   theBritish Commonwealth, or such of them aswished to attend such discussions.(6) The venue of the preliminary consultations, as also of the Conference. itself, would depend on theattitude of the Canadian Government,(c) In our view, the Conference must be on a ministerial level.(2) It was agreed that we should forthwith communicate tothe Commonwealth Governments a set of proposalswhich we might support at the. proposed Conference,and that this statement should be on the lines of annex &quot; C&quot; to the Memorandum by the minister without Portfolio, amended in the light of the pointsagreed on in the War cabinet s discussion.(3) The Lord Privy Seal was invited to prepare the amendedversion of Annex &quot; C&quot; in consultation with theMinisters or representatives of Departments principally concerned.i (4) The Lord Privy Seal was also invited to prepare a short statement, focussing the main issues, which could formthe basis for a personal telegram from the PrimeMinister to the President, to ascertain his generalreaction to our preliminary proposals.(5) The Lord Privy Seal was also invited to assume responsi-bility for the Conference and inter-Dominion discussionsso&quot; far as the United Kingdom Government was concerned, as well as for the co-ordination of Govern-ment policy. He would take under review at a later stage, in consultation with the Committee oh theMachinery of Government, the departmental organisa-. tion and Ministerial responsibility for post-war civilaviation matters; and, in particular, whether any changes should be made before hostilities ceased. For these purposes he would be assisted by a Committee ofMinisters to be nominated by the Prime Minister.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,25th June, 1943.
