The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious eight days. Four main night attacks had been carried Out.:.against Dusseldorf and Munster on the 11th/12th, against Bbchumon the 12th/13th, and against Oberhaiisen on-the 13th/14th. Allatta,cks were considered to be good, that against Dusseldorf beingthe heaviest yet delivered. Coastal Command had sunk one U-boat.Enemy losses for the previous eight days had been 32 destroyed,7 probably destroyed and 22 damaged. Our losses had been88 bombers, 11 Coastal Command aircraft and 14 fighters.United States Air Forces had attacked Wilhelmshaven andCuxhaven, Bremen and Kiel, losing 34 aircraft.- During the previous eight days Allied Air Forces had carriedout 10,000 sorties. Enemy losses in this area had been 91 aircraft destroyed, 21 probably destroyed and 29 damaged. We had lost21 aircraft. &apos;Operations in the Pacific had been restricted.Shipping losses by enemy action during the week, includingbelated reports, amounted to 22,000 tons.Prisoners captured at Pantelleria, Lampedusa and Linosaamounted to about 15,000. In addition, 110 heavy and 70 light gunshad been captured on Pantelleria and some 60 guns on Lampedusa.The Russians had been carrying out, a number of local opera-tions, mainly in the Northern Sector, during the past week. Itwould seem possible that the enemy were delaying offensive operations on the Russian front pending developments in other partsof Europe.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.        -Air Raids.Casualties and damage. ..(previous reference,W.M. (43) 79thConclusions,Minute 2.)   ,3. The War Cabinet were given particulars of the casualties in recent air raids on this country.The Prime Minister suggested that rather greater prominencemight now be given to the figures of air-raid casualties published at monthly intervals. In the United States the general public didhot realise that the people of this country were still sufferingcontinuing; though small, casualties as a result of enemy air attack.The War Cabinet Invited the Minister of Information, in consultation withthe Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, tomake arrangements to give effect to this suggestion.4. The Prime Minister-- drew attention to the -resentment, asevidenced by the recent debate in the House of Commons, caused by certain minor anomalies in the conditions governing the grant ofpensions and allowances under the Royal Warrant;  For example,
the question whether a pension was payable -to the widoW of. a soldier killed while oh leave turned, apparently, hot on the cause ofhis death, but On the conditions of his leave. It would be easier to handle the primary issues relating to war pensions if these minorsources of grievance could be dealt with on a common-sense basis,and thus removed/from: thearea of controversy    :The War Cabinet were informed that the Minister ofPensions was reviewing these questions, in the light of the recentDebate, and would shortly be submitting proposals for considerationby the War Cabinet.Liberated andConqueredTerritories.Arrangementsfor Administra-tion and Supply.(Previous ;Reference:W.M. (43) 44thConclusions,Minute $.)5. the War Cabinet had before them the Report (W.P. (43)226) of the enquiry which the Lord President of the Council hadbeen asked to make into the arrangements for the administration of territories liberated or conquered by military operations of theUnited Nations.The Memorandum drew the special attention of the WarCabinet to the following two points : (1) The vital importance of selecting a good proportion of first-class men as Civil Affairs Officers under the Chief civil affairs Officer attached to each Military Commanderentering territory previously occupied by the enemy, andof giving them the right kind of training.(2) The absence of provision for the administration and supplyof areas spontaneously evacuated by the enemy as aresult of military action by the United Nationselsewhere. This might prove to be a gap in our arrangements.In amplification of (2) above, the Lord President of the Councilsaid that, as we should have no representatives in any countriesspontaneously evacuated by the enemy, we should have to rely onad hoc arrangements made at the time. We could hope, however, tohave in this country a number of suitable people who would havereceived training for these duties and could be despatched to such territories at relatively short notice. &apos;In this connection the Home Secretary and Minister of home security asked whether, if circumstances in this country permitted,use might not be made of the Civil Defence Regional Organisation,whose staff had experience in dealing with the analogous problemsof providing relief after air raids. It was explained that individual members of this organisation could volunteer for these duties, and receive training, if an assurance were given that they would be madeavailable for this work when occasion arose.The Minister of Labour and National Sennce &quot;suggested thatsome of the Civil Departments might be able to help the newDirectorate of Civil Affairs at the War Office by putting it in touchwith some of the agencies which could assist the civil administra-tion in liberated territories; It was explained that these departments would be brought into consultation through the medium Of the A.T. (E) Committee described in W.P. (43) 78.The War Cabinet Approved the Report by the Lord President of the Council.subject to the points raised in discussion.India. 6-   The Prime Minister said that he wished to discuss with his Viceroyalty colleagues the succession to the viceroyalty and also certain changes and System       in the system of Command in India.of Command.

. (48) 85th OOM^STOMS .(15th June, 1943, 5.0 p.m.)llPEBBLT&quot;. THE foreign &amp;N SECRETARY said that Dr Bvatt, in discussion with him on the Pacific, said that Australiathought that Portuguese Timor should not be returned to portugal after the war, but that Australia ought to have it.   This put him in the awkward position that it wasnecessary either to inform Dr Evatt of the steps proposedin regard to Operation LIFEBELT, or that we should run the risk, by non-disclosure of the proposed guarantee to Portugal of her overseas Empire, of giving offence.    to Australia.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had no doubt, inthe circumstances,, that the right course was not to disclose the action in hand in regard to OperationLIFEBELT.The War Cabinet endorsed the view expressed by the Prime Minister.Offices of   the War Cabinet, S.W.1.11th June, 1943.
