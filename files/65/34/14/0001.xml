(41) 115th&apos; -Conclusions,Minute 5; andW.Mi (40) 207thConclusions,Minute 12.)1.   The War Cabinet had before them (a) A Memorandum by thei Home Secretary and Minister of-Home  Security  (W.P.   (43)  109)  summarising  theinformation available as to the policy of the BritishCommunist Party since the outbreak of war.(b) A Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ;of;Home Security (W.P. (43) 148) summarising theinformation available about the British Union, withparticular reference to its activities since the outbreakof war. - v-(c) A Note by the Home Secretary and Minister of home security (W.P. (43)  167) covering a statement bySir Oswald Mosley about the continued detention ofBritish Union members,As regards (c) the Home- Secretary and Minister of home security handed round a paper dealing with certain inaccuracies in Sir Oswald Mosley&apos;s statement.The main point raised in discussion was whether it would be appropriate that the two Memoranda by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security should, subject to suitable modifications,be published. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securitysaid that he put forward this issue for consideration, but he haddoubts about it. The Security authorities were prepared to agreeto publication provided that they could have an opportunity of going through the memoranda, and suggesting certain deletions.In discussion, it was agreed that these two memoranda were ofgreat interest and that there was much to be said for their publica-tion. But there were also serious objections. Thus, publication ofthe Memorandum on the British Communist Party might be a source of some&apos; embarrassment vis-a-vis the Russian Government.Moreover, publication at this juncture, when the question of communist Party affiliation to the Labour Party was underdiscussion, might have the result of increasing the support accorded to the Communist Party.So far as concerned the Memorandum on the Fascist Party,the War Cabinet were informed that, if it were published,. Sir Oswald Mosley would wish to be allowed to publish some formof reply. It would be embarrassing to allow persons in detentionto publish manifestos, but at the same time it might be difficult, ifthe Government took the initiative in publishing a document aboutthe British Union, to refuse to allow any reply to be published.There was als.o tthe consideration that if either of thesememoranda were published and extracts therefrom were quoted bya private individual, libel proceedings might be instituted againstthe individual concerned. Two cases were quoted in which this had happened. In this event, unless the Government were preparedto produce the evidence on which the memoranda were based, theaction for liber would probably be successful.      &apos;The War Cabinet-Reached the conclusion that the balance of argument was against publication of the Memoranda about the british union and the Communist Party of Great Britain.2. In connection With the previous minute, reference was madeto the continued detention of about 100 members of the british union, and also to the position of certain enemy aliens still under detention. The War Cabinet were informed that these cases were under constant review by the Home Secretary and Minister of home security and that&apos; the numbers detained had been greatly reduced.Some discussion ensued as to the possibility, in view of the changed circumstances since 1940, of effecting some &quot;further reduction inthe numbers detained.No conclusion was recorded. .Offices of the War Cabinet, S.

^OST SECRET HO circulation.M.(48) 60TH CONCLUSIONS.(Wednesday., 88th April. 1943 - 11,0 a.mP)At the end of Cabinet business THE PRIME MINISTERraised the question of   the salaries of Junior ministers and Whips, in regard to taxation^THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he would likethe assistance of three or four of his colleagues in examining the matter, to see if anything could be doneo     Ifany action was to be taken, he thought it should be by meansof a clause in the forthcoming Finance Bill.The position was by no means free from difficulty.In the Debates on the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937,the level of Ministerial salaries had been defended on theground, among others, that Ministerial salaries were whollysubject to Income Taxe     Ministers of the Crown could not,of course, under the existing law, draw salaries also as members of Parliaments     Any proposal to allow Ministers inthe Commons to take salaries as Members, together with anabated Ministerial salary, would benefit the richer Ministersmore than the poorer, and there would be other complications.At the present time the poorer members were not out of pocketon becoming Junior Ministers, and in any case where a minister would be worse off he could waive his Ministerialsalary and continue to draw salary as a Membere     This hadbeen allowed in one or two easesoIn discussion, considerable support was expressed forthe view that, since Ministers did not cease to be Membersof Parliament on becoming Ministers, it would be equitablethat they should continue to be allowed the same Income Taxconcessions in respect of their Parliamentary duties as they received as M.P. * a before becoming Ministers.    Suchs in respect of Parliamentary expenses wpuldv, of

course, in all cases be subject to an overriding limit of  600.As against this, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUERstated that any concession in the case of Junior ministers might involve serious repercussions from the point of viewof Income Tax law generally.No decision was recorded, but the general view expressed in discussion was that it was hoped that it wouldbe possible to make some concession - on the lines of allowing Ministers in receipt of salaries of say  2,000 ayear or under, the same treatment in respect of expenses incurred by virtue of th&amp;fc Parliamentary duties, as they received while private Members.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would let theChancellor of the Exchequer know which Ministers hewould invite to examine the matter.Subsequently, the Prime Minister appointed aCommittee consisting of :-The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Lord Chancellor,The Home Secretary.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.,mh.
