The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a letter, dated the 28th May, from President Roosevelt pointing out that the United States merchant fleet had continued to increase, whereas ours had decreased, and stating that he had given directions for the transfer to our Flag, for temporary war time duty, of a considerable number of new ships under construction in the United States on completion.

Civil Defences. Air Raid Warning (Previous Reference: W.M. (43) 16th Conclusions, Minute 2.)



5. The War Cabinet took note, with approval of a Note by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (43) 228), covering a Joint Memorandum by himself and the Secretary of State for Air, making the following recommendations as to the air-raid warning system:-

(i) The issue of national air raid messages in Great Britain, which were at present issued from Fighter Group Headquarters, should be decentralised to Observer Centres.

(ii) The responsibility for issuing national air-raid messages should be undertaken by the Ministry of Home Security through their Alarm Controllers at Observer Centres, who were at present responsible for issuing local alarms.

(iii) The transfer of responsibility should be arranged between the two Departments concerned as and when the new tables at Observer Centres were brought into operation.

These recommendations had been approved by the Civil Defence Committee.

6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the revolution in Argentina, which had resulted in the formation of a new Government under General Ramirez, was a favourable event. He had good hopes that the new Government, when established would break with the Axis Powers.



The Prime Minister said that he understood that President Rossevelt thought that the newspaper correspondents were disposed to take a view which favoured General de Gaulle rather than General Giraud. He asked whether the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Information could look into the matter.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Information agreed to do so, but added that it was believed that the de Gaullist correspondents had been more active than those who supported General Girand, in the United States as well as elsewhere.
