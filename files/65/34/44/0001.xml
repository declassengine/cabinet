(^reyioua ,    .Loyd;Pres^ covering*^once.:     --Wihite Paper describing certain measures designed to imposed^jg^ent 2.   At their Meeting on the 3rd June the. War Cabinet hadlli^^^e v &apos; deferred a1 decision as to how certain additional requirements forIP i * &quot; building&apos; labour should be met. The War Cabinet now had beforeReference: them a Memorandum by the Minister of Production (W.P. (43) 260)W M (43) 80th dealing with this matter.Mhiute^I)8&apos; The additional requirements were as follows :-Air Ministry.-^The War Cabinet had decided on the 3rd Junev that the Air Ministry labour force should remain at about 90,000for the period July, August and September. The Secretary of Statefor Air had represented that, even with the labour force of 101,000for which he had previously asked, there would be a shortage at the- end of September of accommodation for 64 British and 140American heavy bombers.The Minister of Production, in his Memorandum, said that he* was unable to make any specific suggestions for additions to thelabour force already approved. But he asked the War Cabinet to endorse the proposal that, so far as the measures already approvedenabled&apos; the Air Ministry labour force to be maintained at&quot; a higher- level than 90,000 without encroaching on other requirements (andhe was certain that it Would amount to over 95,000 during June),this should be done.War Office -Unless the ports were to be congested by storeswhich had to be imported in advance of the arrival of United states troops, work on three additional depots or dispersal points must bej : - started at once.   This would require 3,000 additional labour inJuly, and 5,000 from August to October. Thereafter the labour would be supplied by the United States forces.The Minister of Production recommended that the possibility should be explored of diverting to these three depots labour thatwould otherwise be employed on works required to be completed for; v the United States Forces in April and May 1944; and that the americans should be asked to provide additional labour for these works when their personnel became available during the autumn- - and winter months, to compensate for the British labour employedon the depots during the summer. As animmediate measure, he recommonded that,work on the depots should be begun without any specific addition, to the War Officelabour quota,, and that every effort should be made to make the necessary labour available for them without encroachment oh other parts of; the Government programme.The^following points were madein discussion\-Air Ministry. . &apos;(l)\Fhe Secretary &amp;f State fo^ evenif the Air Ministry labour force was maintained at101,000 until the eat!of /September, there would beshortage of accommodation&quot; for 64 British and 140United States heavy bombers. -(2) He emphasised the extreme difficulty which had been experienced in getting labour into East Anglia.  steps were now being taken through the Regional Committees- -to expedite transfer to this area; but he. believed that additional men would not be available on East Anglian&apos; ;aerodi^es!mtit&apos;&apos;.inid^nlyr.;:-
importanciEsquadrohs.fipTlt	er st		le or:		Let	(4) Aerodrome accommodation would also foe required at datesbetween September 1043 and May 1944 for 2,500 United.   States light&apos; aircraft (light bombers, fighters, recon-- naissance. -;and -&quot; miscellaneous- types).&quot;. A good deal of congestion could be tolerated oh these areodromes until-&quot;the: Spring.   But this requirement, for which no -pro-vision had so. far been made, must not be overlooked:(5) The Minister of Production said that during the monthsof May and June the Air Ministry had on the. averagereceived more than the labour quota allotted to them.- The extra labour for which the Secretary of State askedwas not available, and he did not think it was wise to upset the programme already agreed for some .5,000 men.After all, this figure represented a rather fine adjust-ment on a programme of this magnitude. He thoughtthat with the labour already allotted the Air Ministry-would substantially complete their programme, and if need be some small delay in its completion&apos;would have tobe faced.&quot; .    .War Office/   -(6) The Quartermaster-General emphasised that the furtherrequest now under consideration only covered stores.The Americans had agreed to their troops going intok&apos;     jtents for the last two or three months of the winter.(7) The Minister of Production pointed out that in the past the &quot;War Office had taken great risks in cutting thebuilding programme for the Americans, and that their action had been proved right. He thought, however, thatthe demand for these dispersal points ought to be met,but only at the cost of other requirements.Admiralty. .. (8) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, as their labour force had been substantially below the allocation forsome months, it was not possible to absorb labour at as high a rate as had been anticipated. They were there-fore able to accept some reduction, in the quota for thenext quarter, on the assumption that thereafter theAdmiralty allocation would be restored to the-normal..   figure. &apos;     pGeneral.(9) In discussion of the problem as a whole, it was generallya agreed that, in view of the present man-power shortage,it was impossible to increase the man-power allocated toit would clearly be wrong to disturb the carefullybalanced arrangement which had been agreed upon, ata time when the man-power position as a whole was shortly being brought under review.-10) The completion to time of aerodromes for heavy bomber squadrons (more particularly the United 3Kingdoih&quot;     squadrons) was, of course,, a very important operationalrequirement.   Tbisy however, seemed to depend less onthe - general manpower shortage. than upon thespecialmeasures how on foot to concentrate labour in East.....Anglia. wSHS^^ &apos;..
