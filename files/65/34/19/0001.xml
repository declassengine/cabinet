Jpifcwlt;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; THE War, Cabinet had before,them telegrams from theConstitutional Minister of State (No. 1095) and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inCrisis,   . .     Cairo (Nos. 855 and 911) regarding the possibility that King Farouk(Previous       would dismiss Nahas Pasha and his Government.        -  ,Reference; The Secretary of State for ForeignW.M. (41) 94th Majesty&apos;s Ambassador had originally proposed that, with a viewConclusions,    to preventing the/summarydismissal of the Waf d Government^ hejMjnute 4.)      should advise the King to allow Nahas Pasha to go to the country if he so desired.   This proposal had been approved;&apos; by1 HisMajesty&apos;s Government; and the Chiefs of Staff had instructed theCommahdersVin-chief in Egypt^;tQ?arrange?thii.tythe advice tenderedby HisiMajesty&apos;s Ambassadorcould be backed by-fdree if need arose.Subsequently,, the&apos;Commander^: Of making British troops available&apos;circumstafaeesj! At a&apos; meeting of&apos; the^ Defehce^Committee in Cairoon the 27th April they had indicated that they could not contemplate the use of force without prejudice to other and bigger, issues; and they were telegraphing to the Chief s of Staff their viewson the military implications of using force, at the present time.This telegram had not yet, however, been received.    . -Meanwhile, His Majesty&apos;s&quot;. Ambassador was asking for earlyinstructions regarding the line which he should take with* King Farouk.  He still thought that the right course would be to tender formal advice that Nahas Pasha should be allowed to goto the country if he so desired; but he was disinclined to tendersuch advice unless he were assured that means would be availableto enforce that advice if, in the last resort, the use of force became- necessary. If the means of coercion were not available, even in the- last resort, it&quot; might be preferable that*his action should take theform of an appeal to King Farouk, rather than formal advice.The Minister of State, while agreeing that all reasonable efforts should be made to keep Nahas Pasha and his Government in office,deprecated any threat of coercion. He believed that His Majesty&apos;ambassador had a good chance of persuading the&apos;King to retainNahas without threatening &quot;force; and that, on balance, it would bebetter to let the Wafd go out of office rather &quot;than contemplate the useof force and the deposition of King Farouk in order to keep themin office.     -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that instructions might be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador on thev        following lines:- o$;(i) We should not rule out in advance coercive measures against the King; but equally His Majesty&apos;s government -ment were not committed, at the present stage, to the&apos;    v.-1 use of force.      : &apos; \:    &apos;\ -(ii) There was no question of an appeal to the King, but HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador should tender formal advice.Any military dispositions which it might be necessaryto make should not be made at the same time as advice. was tendered. -(iii) The advice tendered should be that we did not regard the dismissal of Nahas at this juncture as in the best interestof Egypt or of the war effort. If it was thought necessary that the air should be cleared, this should bedone by a general election. His Majesty&apos;s ambassador was prepared to discuss such measures as could be taken for seeing that the elections were fairly conducted.(iv) If King Farouk ignored- our adyice, no action should be; taken with a view to its being enforced without further-   reference home. -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed put that&apos;aetioh;on-&apos;thesf.lines/WOulAlM)ld-.&apos;&apos;the position until we had heard theviews of the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East.        &apos;  ,In discussion, the view was put forward^that instructions onthese lines would not enable His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to decide
whether to act strongly. In the last resort, the question to besettled was that posed in paragraph 2 (d) in the Minister of State&apos;stolegram^ namely, whether, in me final issue, should the King remainobdurate, we should -be prepared to turn him out in order to keepthe Wafd in. - &apos;&quot; It was,agreed that the first step was to make up our minds onthis point and to base our action on it. -The general view of the War Cabinet was that we should beprepared, if necessary, to use force in order to avoid the dismissal of Nahas.. There could be no hope of gaining the friendship of theKing,&apos; while if We allowed Nahas to be dismissed we should incur the enmity of the Wafd, and troubles in Egypt were certain to ensue.It was bad policy, particularly in the East, to allow it to be thoughtthat our friends could not rely upon us.The next question discussed was whether a decision in this sense should be despatched at once, or whether the War cabinet could defer a decision for, say, 48 hours, until the views of theCominanders-in-Chief had -been received. It was pointed out thatthe use of force might mean recourse to units which were training for specific operations, which might thereby be delayed. It was felt that it would be preferable to defer a final decision until theviews of the Commanders-in-Chief had been received, but that, inview of the delay which had already occurred, His Majesty&apos;ambassador should be given authority to act at once should he findthis necessary.The War Cabinefs Conclusions were as follows :-(1). The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was authorisedto send a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador on thefollowing lines: ] (a) We should prefer to defer a final decision for, say,48 hours, until the views of the Commanders-in-Chief on the military implications of the use of force had been received.(6) If, however, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador was of theopinion that the situation did not admit of anyfurther delay, he was authorised &quot;to tender formaladvice to King Farouk on the lines set out inparagraph 5 (a) of his telegram No. 855 namely,that Nahas Pasha should be allowed to go to thecountry if he so desire with the knowledge thatthis advice would, if necessary, in the last resortbe backed by force.&apos;(c) Instructions were being sent to the Commanders-in-Chief to provide the necessary support.(2) The Chiefs of Staff were invited to telegraph to the commanders-in-Chief, informing them of the decision in (1), and instructing them to lend the necessary support to whatever action was deemed necessary by HisMajesty&apos;s - Ambassador. -Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,May 5, 1943.
