The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (43) 135) on the recbmmenda-tions of the Select Committee set up to report oh the effect of theproposal that equal rates of compensation should be payable to civilian men and women in respect of war injuries.The War Cabinet were informed that the Lord President^Committee had considered the Report of the Select Committee andhad decided to advise the War Cabinet to accept their recommen-dations, viz. :-(i) that civilian women should be compensated equally with. civilian men for war injuries;(ii) that the distinction between gainfully and non-gainf ullyoccupied persons should be abolished; and(iii) that a married man. in receipt of an injury allowance should receive a wife&apos;s allowance when not in hospital;As a corollary, the Lord President^ Committee also recom-mended that the principle of equal compensation for men andwomen in respect of war injuries should be extended to all war service injuries sustained by Civil Defence volunteers and todisability pensions payable to men and women in the basic ranks in the Services and the Merchant Navy. The rates for women inthe higher ranks in the Services should be increased by the amountof the increase made in the basic rates.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had reserved hisposition in respect of (ii) above, said that the cost of these changeswas relatively small,, but he was concerned about possible reper-cussions. Since the scheme was extended to non-gainf ully occupiedpersons in 1940, the Government had proceeded on the basis that persons gainfully occupied at the time of the injury had a claim to higher rates of allowances and pensions than persons not sooccupied. If the rates for non-gainfully occupied persons were now raised to the level of those payable to the gainfully occupied,he feared that at some future date a demand would be made thatthe rates for gainfully occupied persons should be further increased on the ground that their loss was greater. He also felt some anxiety about the repercussions of this proposal on other schemes,e.g., workmen&apos;s compensation.The War Cabinet were informed that these points had beendiscussed with representatives of the Trades Union Congress, whohad given an assurance that they adhered to the evidence offered ontheir behalf to the Select Committee and agreed that the ratespayable under this scheme to gainfully occupied persons should nolonger be related to earnings. In these circumstances, the scheme could now be put on the basis that the compensation was made inrespect of war injury and had no regard to loss of earning capacity.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that; if; asproposed, the scheme was now put on this basis, subsequent demands for increased rates for gainfully occupied persons could be. resistedand there should be no repercussions on levels of remuneration or on other schemes of compensation.
Cabi(1)&apos; ApprovM the proposals in W.P.

(43) 135. &apos;Civil Defence.Bethnal Green .Tube ShelterDisaster.Report byMr. Dunne.   ;(Previous i -Reference:   &apos;  &apos;,W.M. (43) 38thConclusions,,!;Minute 4.)..; 6. The War Cabinet had: before thenl a Memorandum by jtheHome Secretary and Minister of Horne Security (WP. (43) 137)covering the draft?of a White Paper summarising the conclusions;of the Enquiry held by Mr. Laurence Dunne into the disaster at&apos;atube shelter in Bethnal Green on the 3rd March.Doubt was expressed as to the expediency of publishing asummary of Mr. Dunne&apos;s findings. -&quot; The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe had stated in the House of Commons on the 10th March that,subject to security considerations, the conclusions would bepublished. At,the time of the disaster there had been considerablepublic feeling, particularly among people living in the neighbour-hood, and there had been some dissatisfaction that the enquiry should be held in private. Pressure for a Public Enquiry had beenresisted on the basis that, subject to security considerations, the findings would be published, and, if it were now decided thatMr. Dunne &apos;s conclusions should not be announced, it would be generally assumed that there was something to hide.In discussion, there was strong: support for the view that thepublication of the proposed White Paper would give the incidenta disproportionate importance, and might encourage the enemy tomake further nuisance raids.The view of the War Cabinet was that it would be preferableif the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, instead of publishing a summary of the conclusions in a White Paper, madea short oral statement in the House of Commons. Points to beincluded in such a statement would be that Mr. Dunne&apos;s report hadbeen received and considered; that certain suggestions had beenmade for modifications of existing arrangements which might reduce the risk of a further disaster of this kind, and that action was already being taken to introduce these modifications, not only at this shelter, but at similar shelters elsewhere; and that therewas no evidence whatever for the suggestion that the disaster was due to Jewish or Fascist elements among the people taking refugein the shelter.The War Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of home security to consider whether he could not deal with thismatter by an oral statement in the House of Commons on .these lines. &apos;Refugees. 7.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that the(Previous United States Government had now appointed their representativesReference: to the Conference on Refugees, which was to he held at Bermuda.W.M. (43) 44th The Secretary of State proposed that our Delegation should conclusions, comprise the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignMinute 4.) Affairs (Mr. Law), the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Home Affairs (Mr. Peake), and the Financial Secretary to theAdmiralty (Mr. Hall). -The Secretary of State said that the chief aim of the delegation Would be to secure United States agreement over-(a) the use of North Africa as a territory of refuge for allied and stateless refugees;
(b) an approach to the Governments of- the United Nations to; : secure jan;-international KCj6n%r0nce i6n refugees;;.(e) a joint declaration, mainly for the benefit of the neutral. , countries now harbouring large numbers of refugees,that the united nations will regard this problem as their responsibility at the end of the war.All decisions on: questions of policy would be subject to reference back to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet- - &apos; ,,&apos; &apos;&apos; &apos;      &apos;  k,i^V       Approved these arrangements.      - -Church Bells.(Previcus&apos; Reference:W.M&apos;. (42) 151stConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Secretary of\ State forWar said that the Debate inthe House of Lords on the 31st March had shown that there was strong feeling in favour of permission being given -&quot;for. Church bellsto he rung. He also thought that the statement made by the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security on the 31st March as to restrictions on coastal areas somewhat weakened the case for continuing the ban oh ringing Church bells.It had been suggested that the ringing of Church bells might now be permitted, except in Regulated Areas. He proposed toarrange for this suggestion to be considered. In the circumstances it was for consideration whether he should give an entirely negativereply to a Question by Mr. Stokes, M.P., for answer on thefollowing day. , ,7Discussion showed that the general view of Ministers was thatit would be inadvisable to give any indication that the possibilityof making a change in this matter was under consideration unless and until the question had been fully examined and a decision hadbeen reached. The view was also expressed that the general publichad grown accustomed to the present position and were not pressing for any change.In these circumstances it was agreed that the Secretary ofState for War&apos;s reply to this question should be that he had nothing to add to the answers previously given on this matter.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,,April 5, 1943.
