Pensions and Determination of Needs Bill. 

Position in regard to Widows.



1. The War Cabinet were informed that it was thought likely that there might be considerable opposition to one aspect of the proposals in this Bill. Under the Bill as drafted; widows pensioned under the Contributory Pensions Act and receiving allowances thereunder in respect of children, were transferred from Public Assistance to the Assistance Board. When, however, their children ceased to be eligible for allowances under the Contributory Pensions Act widows had to apply to the Public Assistance Authorities. It was thought that this transfer from the Assistance Board to Public Assistance would be greatly disliked, and that the Bill&apos;s passage would be greatly eased if this point could be met.

On the other hand, it was urged that a concession on this point would be inconsistent with the basis of the Government&apos;s decision in this matter and would create further anomalies.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had not had time to consider the matter in all its bearings, but that he would do so that evening in consultation with the Minister of Health.

The War Cabinet-

Agreed that consideration of this point should be resumed at their Meeting on the following day.



Ceylon Constitutional Reform. (Previous Reference: W.M. (48) 47th Conclusions, Minute 8.)



2. At their Meeting on the 1st April the War Cabinet had invited a Committee under the chairmanship of the Lord President of the Council to examine the draft statement which it was proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make on the question of constitutional reform in Ceylon.

The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (43)204) covering a revised draft of this statement, designed to meet the criticisms made in the earlier discussion in the War Cabinet and the suggestions put forward by the Committee.

The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the revised draft had been telegraphed to the Governor of Ceylon, who had no hesitation in recommending that it should now be communicated to Ceylon Ministers, though he could give no assurance that it was likely to prove acceptable to them. The Board of Ministers had urged that a final reply to their representations should be made before the 25th May, when the State Council was due to reassemble. A Motion demanding complete independence had already been tabled; and, if no declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government had by then been made there was some risk that this Motion might be carried. It would, of course, be idle for His Majesty&apos;s Government to publish a statement in the terms of the revised draft after such a Motion had been carried by the State Council; and in these circumstances it was most important that the statement should be communicated to the Board of Ministers in the course of the next few days.

It was the view of the War Cabinet that the Prime Minister&apos;s concurrence should be obtained before this communication was made to the Ceylon Ministers.

The War Cabinet-

(1) Approved the terms of the revised statement annexed to W.P. (43) 204.

(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange for a telegram to be sent forthwith to the Prime Minister,* informing him that the War Cabinet attached importance to the Governor being authorised to make the revised statement within the next few days, and seeking his concurrence in this course.

3. The. War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the:Secretary of State for India (W.P. (43) 203) regarding a letter which Gandhi desired to be forwarded to Jinnah. This purported to respond to a suggestion which the latter had made in a speech tothe Moslem League Conference On the 24th April, and. proposed thatJinnah should visit him for the purpose of discussing &quot; the questionof communal unity as men determined on finding a commonsolution.&quot; .    &apos;For the reasons set out in a telegram reproduced as appendix III. of-the Memorandum, the Viceroy recommended thatthe Government of India should forward this letter to Jinnah and, ifthe latter subsequently asked to see Gandhi, should allow such ameeting to take place. The Secretary of State for India, for. thereasons given in his covering Memorandum, took the view that theletter should not be forwarded and that no meeting between gandhi and Jinhah should be allowed so long as Gandhi and the congress party maintained their present policy.The War Cabinet agreed that in present circumstances it wouldbe inexpedient to allow Gandhi&apos;s letter to go forward, or a meeting to. take place between Gandhi and Jinnah. They recognised,however, that it was likely to become known in India that Gandhihad extended this invitation to Jinnah; and that, as a refusal toallow such a meeting was open to misinterpretation, it was important that the Government of India should issue a consideredstatement of their reasons for stopping Gandhi &apos;s letter and notallowing the meeting to take place.. Discussion centred on the grounds on which the decision shouldbe based. On the one hand, it was suggested that it would be enough to take the line that Gandhi was detained on security grounds and that it was impossible to allow a person so detained to conduct political discussions while under detention. On the otherhand, it was urged that the preferable course would be to make itclear that Gandhi, having embarked on a policy of promoting massdisobedience, and having shown no intention of abandoning it,could not be allowed to carry on political activities.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Viceroy should be advised to stop Gandhi&apos;sletter to Jinnah, and to tell his Council that this hadbeen done in pursuance of the general policy approvedby them. The Government of India should at the sametime publish a considered statement, giving the reasonsfor the action taken, on the lines indicated at &quot;X.&quot;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for India to submit, forconsideration at their meeting on the following day, thedraft of a telegram to the Viceroy embodying this advice, t .Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.

MOST SECRET NO circulation.M.(43) 70th CONCLUSIONS(Tuesday, 18th May, 1943 - 5.0 p.nu)THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER referred to the discussion at the War Cabinet on the 28th April (not recorded in theMinutes) about salaries of Junior Ministers and Whips, inregard to taxations     Subsequent to that Meeting, the PrimeMinister had appointed a Committee, consisting of theChancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman), the Lord chancellor and the Home Secretary, to examine the matter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Committeehad now examined the matter and had framed a Report, whichhe read to the War Cabinet (See Annex to this Minute)     the upshot of the recommendation in this Report was that in thecase of Members of Parliament who are Ministers in receiptof a salary not exceeding  1,500, the Ministerial salary wouldbe treated for Income Tax purposes as if it included paymentof salary as Member, against which the Minister would beentitled to claim any expenses wholly, exclusively andnecessarily incurred in the performance of his duties asMember.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that all members received a flat allowance of  100, irrespective ofthe amount of expenses, and could claim actual expenses ifthey exceeded  100*     But the cost of living in London,which is ordinarily an allowable expense to a Member whoseconstituency lay outside London, was not an expense whichcould be claimed by a Junior Minister.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would propose to deal with the matter by a Clause in the finance bill, which he would propose to move on the Report Stage.The Chief Whip, to whom he (The Chancellor) had spoken,thought that, besides taking other steps to ensure that thisproposal would not give rise to controversy, Junior ministers should themselves be asked their opinion in regard to it.It might be that they would feel that, seeing that the concession would in most cases amount to  50 a year nett, itwas not worth while dealing with the matter by a Clause in theFinance Bill.     If a substantial minority of Ministers wereagainst the proposal, the Chancellor thought that it v/ould notbe right to go on with the matter.In discussion, some Ministers expressed the view that theproposal was barely worth while.The general view of the War Cabinet was, however, that itwas desirable to make some concession to meet the case of junior Ministers, and it was accordingly decided that theChancellor of the Exchequer and his colleagues on the Committeeshould be authorised to put the matter to Junior Ministers,under a pledge of secrecy, and ascertain their views in regardto the matter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook, when this had been done, to report back to the War Cabinet.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.,20th May, 1943.

1*     The Committee has considered the question of the salaries and taxation of Junior Ministers in the light ofthe annexed. Memorandum of the 7th of May and recommend that,in the case of Members of Parliament who are Ministers inreceipt of a salary not exceeding  1,500, the Income Tax law should be amended so that for the purposes of the IncomeTax the Ministerial salary should be treated as includingpayment of salary as Member against which the Minister wouldbe entitled to claim any expenses that can be shown to be wholly exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of his duties as Member.2*    Under the existing income tax law a Member ofParliament who is paid as Member is entitled to a deduction from his salary in respect of expenses wholly exclusivelyand necessarily incurred in the performance of his duties asMember which include the cost of living away from home, costof secretarial assistance, etc. and under a Treasury order made by virtue of the Income Tax Acts.all Members receive a flat allowance of  100 irrespective of the amount of theexpenses leaving the Member to claim actual expenses if theyexceed  100.   The Committee contemplate that this TreasuryOrder will apply to the Minister who is Member equally as it applies to the Member who is not a Minister so that under their proposal the Junior Minister with a salary noteexceeding  1,500 will enjoy at least an allowance of  100and will be given his actual expenses as Member if theyexceed  100.3.     It is to be noted   that the cost of living inLondon which is ordinarily an allowable expense of the Memberwhose constituency is outside London will not be an expensethat can be claimed by the Junior Minister to be an expense&quot;exclusively&quot; incurred as Member, for the holding of his postas Junior Minister involves his residence in London.   Thisis of considerable importance as the ordinary taxpayer whoholds an office in London and has his home elsewhere gets no allowance for the cost of residing in London if he maintainsanother residence there and he would certainly have a grievance if a Minister received an allowance in respect ofsuch a cost.   The allowable expenses under the committee proposal will therefore cover other expenses, e.g. cost ofsecretarial assistance for constituency work and the like.4.     The Committee do not consider that their proposal will be regarded as contentious but they feel that it isessential that assurances should be obtained in regardthereto before introducing the Clause in the Finance Bill tmdthat will be necessary.5.     The Committee1 s proposal is founded on the viewthat as a Minister must be a Member of the Commons or aPeer the expenses falling to be borne by the Minister whois Member solely in respect of his duty to his constituencyare expenses which can properly be regarded as expenses ofhis office as Minister and they think that this v iew willcommand general acceptance and is not open to any criticism on the ground of preferential treatment.   It is true that theexisting flat rate allowance of  100 has been laid down on thebasis of the allowable expenses including cost of living inLondon whereas the allowable expenses of the Minister-Memberwill hot include the cost of living in London but theCommittee do not think that their proposal is open to anyserious objection on that score. v;

6.     Our recommendation, if adopted, will &quot;necessitate the insertion of a Clause in the Finance Billon the following lines.   Parliamentary Counsel advisesthat it is necessary to mention the offices as the term&quot;Junior Minister&quot; has no statutory existence.&quot;(l)   A Member of the House of Commons who holds any ofthe offices to which this Section applies shall betreated for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts as if -(a) he received the salary of a Member ofthe House of Commons;   and(b) the salary of his office were correspondinglyabated.(2)     The offices to -which this Section applies are any of the following offices with an annual salary notexceeding  1,500, that is to say -(a) Secretary to any Government Department;(b) Under-Secretary of state(c) Lord of the Treasury;(d) Lord of the Admiralty;(e) Assistant Postmaster-General;(f) Any office in His majesty Household;(g) Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means.&quot;
