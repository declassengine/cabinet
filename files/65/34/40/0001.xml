(43)21%:(ii) A Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Productioncommehting on the proposed division of occupied terri^tory into three main zones (W.P. (43) 243).(1) The first main issue discussed was whether at this; stage itwas desirable or indeed practicable to attempt to lay down theprinciples which should govern our action in this matter. Thus, itwas pointed out that it was very difficult to predict the conditionslikely to prevail when hostilities ceased, and this made it difficult to study the problem in detail. The sequence of events might wellitself provide the solution to many of the problems which to-dayappeared so intractable. , :iOn the other hand, the War Cabinet were informed that the americans had already studied these problems in considerable detail. The Russians had also displayed interest in them. More-over, there were dangers in trying to reach agreement between theAllies at the last minute on questions of great complexity.As regards the principles set out on pages 2 and 3 of theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, thediscussion turned mainly on two points raise by head (G).(2) Total or Partial Occupation.-The question was raised whether it was wise that we should commit ourselves to the view thatGermany should be totally occupied. On the one hand it was urgedthat this would involve the British people in the burden of main-taining and administering a large part of Germany, and that our policy should be to make the Germans, so far as possible, administerthemselves, under adequate Allied supervision. If there was nocentral enemy Government with which we were prepared to treat,We should have to deal in the first instance with the militaryauthorities.- On the other hand, the view was expressed that we might well have to carry out some form of occupation of all the main centres ofGerman industry.(3) Occupation by Zo?ies.Several.Ministers expressed agree-ment with the view set out in the Memorandum by the Minister of^Aircraft Production, that it was undesirable that occupied territory should be divided into three zones in which the occupying forces would be- predominantly British, American and Russian respect-ively. The creation of such zones might, it was argued, cause serious political embarrassments.On the other hand, the view was expressed that there would begrave practical administrative difficulties in having contingentsfrom the forces of each of the three major Allies mixed up in eachzone.The general view expressed was that heading ,(G) required, further examination.V : J (4) 0r. E/batt: suggested that the Dominion Governments shouldbe^ consulted *of the supervisory body referredto in (J) of the Memorandum bythe Secretary of State&apos;.-for ForeignAffairs^ ahdon the extent to which they would be prepared to con-- tribute to the policing of Europe. . .       ;(5) Further discussionthen took place as to whether it wouldbe expedient that discussion of these Armistice problems should takeplace in Moscow at;the present time. The Secretary of State for&apos;&apos;F^ormgw-A-iffi$ts-said; thatvhe-&apos; had in mind to raise the matter orallyin London with the American: and - Soviet Ambassadors, by way of preliminary exploratory discussions without entering into any

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the future of Austria(W.P. (43)218).In a covering note, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that our efforts to encourage resistance to Germany in.Austria were hampered by the absence of a declared policy asregards the future of Austria.In paragraph 35 of his Memorandum he summarised the main points which that policy should include, e.g., as a first step, there-creation of an independent Austrian State; that, once restored,independent Austria, mUst from the start be given.preferential treatment as compared with Germany; and that the best chance ofmaintaining Austrian independence lay in its ultimate association with some form of Central or South-East European Confederation.The following were the main points made in discussion :-(i) The economic aspects of an independent Austrian State orof a Central or South-East European Confederationwere an essential element in the problem and should be closely examined.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that much work had been done on those aspects of the matterand he would consider circulating a paper.(ii) The independent Austrian State had undergone consider-,   able hardships in the inter-war period.   Taken by itself,. the promise of an independent Austria might not there-fore have much appeal, and emphasis should be laidrather on the freedom of Austria from Prussiandomination.(iii) There was general agreement that we should aim at a central European or Danubian Group centred onVienna. Such a Group should aim at combining theeconomic stability of the larger Unit, with the consider-able degree of freedom, in purely local affairs, of thesmaller National or racial units into which Austria-Hungary had broken up at the end of the last war. the presentation of this conception would, however, call for for great care if jealousies and Susceptibilities were not&apos;\-&apos;-: to be-aroused.&apos;-:&quot;(iv) It might prpveimpprta;nt that this; larger shouldbe established soon after the war ended, before therehad been timeforopinion,to liarden oh other lines.The Secretary of*---Sto^:?for-&apos;i Foreign Affairs said that thediscussion had given him sufficient indication of the views of; theWar Cabinet to provide guidance in our; propaganda activities, andiiifsuen ^elimihary idisb to havewitii^Cl]^i]^6n;:-.U^tted Statfes; and: Soviet?

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary 5 State for Foreign Affairs (W^pSiSbout the supply of^military and civil stores to Turkey.The War Cabinet noted (a) That all possible steps had been taken for the delivery of stores to Turkey from April onwards.(h\ That there might, nevertheless, be a slight shortage of cargo() ^ffivery^.Turkey from the Middle East in the early(e) ThrltffiTilM vehicles would beyant  , &apos;      before the arrival of regular shipments from the UnitedKingdom and North America.4. The War Cabinet had &quot;before them a Joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister ofProduction (W.P. (43) 23*5) containing copies of the documents which had now been presented to the representatives of the SovietGovernment in Washington, Ottawa, and London, to form the basisof an agreement providing for the continuance of supplies to Russiafor the twelve months the 1st July, 1943, to the 30th June, 1944.The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the above document.&apos;The War Cabinet were informed that the Russians had askedto be supplied with Mosquito aircraft.The War Cabinet-Decided that the. answer to this request should be that wewere unable to supply them with Mosquito aircraft, butthat we would make available to them models and plans toenable Mosquito aircraft to be built in Russia, and facilities for Russian pilots to fly aircraft of this type inthis country.u  &apos; , Jke War Cabinet had before them a Report (W.P (43) 201)by the MmisteriaL Committee set up by the. War Cabinet at their meeting on the 29th March to consider the questions of policy raisedby the Report of the Departmental Committee appointed toexamine the possibility of establishing special electoral machinery to meet the situation resulting from war conditions.Discussion showed that the War Cabinet were in generalagreement with the Committee&apos;s recommendations, save on thequestion of machinery for redistribution.The War Cabinefs Conclusions were as follows:-(1) It should be assumed that the National Registration system would be kept in being for a sufficiently long time tocover a. post-war General Election.(2) The compilation of an Armed Forces Register should be begun iat ah early date. Members of the Forces shouldbe entitled to vote as soon as their names had beenei\-Y,&apos;V: y&apos;y.entered on the Armed Forces Eegiste:.. :.....................-......   &apos;
llOtlOI.f theCommittee being modified so. as to enable..a&apos;printed op-ronebed; Register to be prepared in any qonstituency^soon as possible after a vacancy occurred in thatconstituency.If there were a war-time General Election, it shouldbe conducted On the basis of a printed or to register appfying to the whole country,&quot; No provision should, therefore, be made in the ;Billfor an Election by means of production of Nationali     Registration cards.(4) The question Whether Parliamentary and Local Governmentfranchises should be assimilated should be deferred forfurther consideration.1      (5) There should&apos;be no change in the voting age.^distribution. The proposed legislation should include provision for the* appointment forthwith of a Commission to recommend,a scheme of redistribution,, which should, if possible, beintroduced in time to become effective at the first GeneralElection to be held after the war.(7) Should the proposed legislation contain a provision creatingpermanent redistribution machinery on the lines outlined in the Report of the Departmental Committee! Mdecision on thjs issue was deferred pending considera-tton by the War Cabinet of a further. Memorandum tobe submitted by the Home Secretary and Minister of&quot;i Home Security.(8) The draft Statement appended to the Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security was approved, subject to the necessary modifications to giveeffect to the above decisions.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,lQthJune, 1943,
