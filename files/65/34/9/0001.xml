IV THE War Cabinet.had before them a Memorandum by theMinister without Portfolio (W.P. (43) 103) submitting, on behalfpi&apos; the &quot;Committee oh Reconstruction Problems,; a Report on-Post-War Agricultural Policy prepared by the agricultural departments: The Committee on Reconstruction Problems, (three ministers dissenting) invited the War Cabinet to give authority, for.discussions to be opened on the basis of the Report with agricultural interests in this country,; and in due course with the Dominionsand India, on the understanding that no financial commitmentswere implied.The War Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (43)152)-Suggesting that discussions with outside interests ought not to be initiated until the general lines of policy had; been broadly agreed,and setting out a number of questions of substance which, in hisopinion, needed further study before agreement could be reached on the policy to be adopted.The first issue raised in the discussion was whether it was expedient that discussions with thea,agricultural interests should be initiated at this stage.(Previous The War Cabinet were informed that this procedure WasBeference:      suggested in the hope that it would be possible to guide the farmersW.M. (43) 50th into accepting a moderate post-war agricultural policy which would conclusions,    not conflict with the commercial policy which we might wish to minute l.)      adopt after the war.   If left to themselves, the farmers would-probably formulate more extravagant demands.    It was not&apos;   intended, at this stage, to enter into any financial commitments;the discussions would be exploratory and provisional, and final decisions would be reserved until such time as the Government werein a position to review all reconstruction projects as a whole.In, his statement, on the 1st December, 1942,* the Minister, without Portfolio had indicated that Ministers would probably beready to open discussions with the farmers early in the spring ofthisyear.;and it was believed that the. prospects of securing general  agreement on a policy on the lines indicated in the Report would be favourable at, the, present time.   Moreover, there were numeroustechnical problems which called for detailed discussion with theagricultural interests.,  The difficulties of the hill-sheep farmers were... mentioned in this connection.&apos; These discussions would&apos; necessarily be protracted; and On this account it was important that they should be started soon.In discussion the objection was raised thai in practice- satisfactory discussions with the farmers could not be carried on, if all questions of\ finance- and prices were reserved.   It might be&quot;... argued that the views of the farmers could be obtained on thegeneral principles underlying the Report, vii., a system of mixedfarming together with close public control of farming -operations.But if there was to be no commitment about prices; why should the. farmers accept the restrictions proposed without knowing what theywere to receive in return. Would not the negotiations reach a stageat; which either some assurance on. finance would have to be given,or the discussions would break down 1 ...The general view of the War Cabinet was against openingdiscussions with the farmers at this stage.The second main issue raised was as follows: // di^cus^^ajljoere initiated iyiththe farmers on the bastsindicated in the Report^ wotdd this not be inconsistent with theGovernment&apos;s general policy (as announced in the Debate onthe Beyeridge Report \),that financial commitments in respectof schemes of post-War reconstruction could not be, accepteduntil it was possible to,make some general forecast],of tJiefinancial implications of post-war policy as a whole??l * Offioial Report, Col. 1095. . .r-&apos; t&apos;&apos;Official;&apos;Repori; 16th, l?th and l$th&quot;&apos;Fetrti*ry, 1643. &apos;s-JPostiWaP ;Policy.
it was hrged that the procedure now proposed was^%M$^^ iu resI On the other, hand, it was argued. that the procedure now-. :isn^l^l!^^diSe^;jm two respects, from. that&apos; followed- .in, - regard tothe^everidgeiteport First;; it /was proposed that the Government^should; take the,initiative in entering! upon discussions which were bound tobecome public. In the case of the-Bev^ridge Report, public discussion and a declUtettiori of the Goverament&apos;sppliey had beenmade iheyitable by the ^publication of the Report and the publicity which it had attracted. Secondly, the present proposal involveddiscussion with interests directly affected py the policy.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that, once thesedisciissipns were begun, it would be very difficult to avoid being forced ihtpk-position in which the claims of agriculture would havetp 6e Considered ih advance of the general review of all post-war reconstruction projects. The War Cabinet took the view that,hefore being discussed with outside interests, proposals for post-war agrictdtural policy must be considered by the ReconstructionPriorities Committee ahd placed in perspective together with all theother claims on the. Exchequer likely to arise from post-war reconstruction projects.; Discussion then turned on various points as to the merits ofirie sckjlmk^ set out in the Report. The following were the main points raised: (a) It should be an object of policy to prevent our agricultural industry from falling into the depressed state which hadcharacterised.the inter-war period and to maintain.a healthy and well-balanced agriculture. No dissent was expressed from the view that to achieve this object itwould be worth our while to undertake expenditure upto a sum of the order indicated in paragraph 4 of w.P. (43) 103, provided,; of course, that the necessary funds could be made available.It was further agreed that every endeavour should\     be made to formulate a post-war policy for agriculturewhich had the full support and agreement of all threepolitical&apos;parties.ip) It was, however, suggested that there should be a clearerconception of the objective of our agricultural policy&apos;than. that given in the Report, in which primaryemphasis was laid on maintaining all reasonably good agricultural land in a state Of fertility and productivity.If help was to be given to the agricultural industry, this &apos;would have to be justified rather by relation to suchprinciples, as for example, nutritional standards, theprovision of food for the people with fair conditions to the producers, or a saving of foreign exchange.(e) Reference was also made to the problem of distribution.Several Ministers emphasised that consideration should.       be given, as an integral part of our post-war agricultural policy, to the problem of promoting increased efficiency in   marketing,   processing   and   distribution.    The&apos; v-&apos;Mini8tnrV&apos; of ;Eopd;-hiad-been asked to put forwardprpposalsi on this&quot; subject in collaboration with theAgricultural-Departments.(tf) It was also pointed out that the scheme proposed contem-plated in the post-war period an increase in our arableacreage of yabqiit/three millnm acres as compared withour pre-war ara^proposed, prices were to-be hxed at a level to give a fair&apos;remuneration to the farmeron. the products&apos; growp on
; marginal land, this would mean paying prices higherthan were necessary: in respect oi&quot;the products grown on.better land. In reply to this it was, stated that-the^:. scheme was based on the maintenance of the fertilityand productivity of &quot; all reasonably good agricultural,land,&quot; and hot of marginal land. -J-(e) Reference was also made to the difficulties whioh land-owners experienced, owing to heavy taxation and deathduties, in fulfilling their functions:- The question was-raised whether the proposals in regard to a LatidCommission Wentfarenougli/^^to meet these difficulties.The War Cabinets decisions were las follows:,(1) It would be premature to authorise discussions at the-present stage with the agricultural interests in this-country on -the basis of the proposals set out in w.P. (43) 103.(2) The Chairman of the Reconstruction Problems Committee?was asked to arrange for the scheme to be re-examined,and for revised proposals to be formulated with a view-to meeting the points raised in discussion.(3) These revised proposals should be submitted (a) In the first instance to the War Cabinet, Who would determine whether a scheme on the lines proposed was acceptable.(b) Thereafter to the Reconstruction Priorities Com-mittee, who would take the scheme into account,     as part of their general review of the claims likelyto be made on the Exchequer after the war.I Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by the Prime-Minister (W.P. (42) 613), covering a Note by the agricultural ministers epitomising the results of their labours on the land.The War Cabinet asked that a formal expression of theiraoproval should be conveyed to the Ministers concerned, and askedthatthey in turn should niake this known throughout their Depart-ments, and among their voluntary assistants.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,April 15,1943.
