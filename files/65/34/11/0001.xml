&quot;W.Stocks of raw. materials in \relation toproductionprogrammes.1.   The War Cabinet considered ,a -Memorandum by theMinister pf Production^W.P. (43), 138) about the effect on produc-&apos; tibn prpgraan^ continuing decliae ih! bur stocks Of rawmaterials. &apos;The. Minister of Pr^^^^^, explained that during the fourimpjit^ per cent, of our total consumption of - imported raw materials had been met by with-drawal from stocks. De^stooking was still continuing, at a somewhat lower rate, and by tfe.e:end ^pf $ arch stocks were only.; 1-l.million tons above the distributional minimum. It wasnecessarythat we should preserve pur capacity, when need arose, to diverti additional ships to military use without disastrous loss of industrial production; and for this purpose we should maintain stocks at the levels held at the end of 1942.To restore stocks to these levels, the Minister proposed thatconsumption of imported raw materials during the rest of 1943should not exceed a conservative estimate of the total likely to be&apos;imported. If, in the event, imports exceeded the ^estimate takeh *forthis purpose, the excess could be used either to replace stocks or tomeet heW and unforeseen demands.In the case of steel, the Minister proposed that allocations forthe second half-year should be limited to 5&apos;4 million tons; ascompared with 5-7 million tons for the first half-year. This wouldmean consumption at the rate of 2-7 million tons per quarter, ascompared with over 3 million tons in the first quarter of the year.He recognised, however, that this reduction would involve special difficulties for the Ministry of Supply; and he had arranged that,if it became necessary, they should be able to draw from a reserveadditional supplies up to a maximum of 300,000 tons over the nine,months ending December 1943.It was  proposed that the approved reduction of 120,000 in thelabour force working for the Ministry of Supply should be accelerated so as to take full effect by the end of September insteadof December 1943; and the new policy now proposed might resultin an additional reduction of 30,000-40,000. While, therefore, the target for employment in war production in 1943 represented atotal labour force substantially larger than that at work in 1942,these readjustments in the programmes might well involve- some temporary and local unemployment.In discussion, emphasis was laid on the importance of reducingthis unemployment to .a minimum. It was explained that hither to the cuts in the Ministry of Supply programme had been made forthe purpose of releasing labour which was required elsewhere, andit had therefore been possible to retain the labour until it could ibereabsorbed. The policy now proposed was to reduce the labour force in order to conserve raw materials; and it would be corres-correspondingly more difficult to ensure that labour would be released at times and in places where it could quickly be reabsorbed.The Minister of Labour and National Service asked that everyeffort should be made to time these releases so as to reduce unemploy-ment to a minimum. If labour was seen to be idle in areas into which, labour had been drafted from elsewhere, there would be a grave risk of starting a movement of workers back to their homeareas, which, if it got out of hand, would involve a very serious lossof manrpower. v, The Minister also expressed the view that, when there was to bea cut in a particular type of production, the Services should jfeavethe firtt call oh young men engaged5in ^it, without reference,;.to theactual factories \&apos;JL^&apos;&quot;^M6h&apos;&apos;mey&apos; were employed; the resultingvacancies&apos; being;^led&apos;where hiecessary by the redistribution of jth^older men engaged in the same type of work. i. ;The Minister of Production said that, while the object of thefurther cuts now proposed was to conserve raw materials, full use would be made&apos;of the existing machineryJto ensure: that so far aspossible the releases were made in the manner best calculated to meetpur mam-power^[2534571b 2

The Prime Minister said that he had now received atelegram from Premier Stalin* stating that he thought the germans were likely to use gas; on the Bussian; front,and that he supportedour intention to renew; the declaration which we had made ayear ago.The Prime Minister said that, if the War Cabinet approved,he proposed to issue a statement on: the following day.,- .   The War Cabinet-Approved this suggestion.In further discussion the suggestion was made that, as partof the arrangementsfor ensuring that Our precautionary measures were in good order, there should be parades in the factories, atwhich gas-masks would be carried,; and that the Home Guardshould wear their gas-ma,risks on the special Parade to be held incelebration of their third anniversary.Hprae&apos;Gaasd..Celebrationof ThirdAnniversary.(Previous.Reference: &quot;WiM;.(43);52nd:Conclusions,Minute 4.)3.

In reply, it was pointed out that, since that date, stocks hadbeen dispersed, which made some increase necessary. Furthermore;at the present time we.:.were having-some difficulty in securing a proper distribution between different types of food imports. Thus,we might find ourselves faced with a shortage in some particularcommodity, notwithstanding that the total level of stocks as a whole was at a satisfactory level. It was suggested that it was important that these facts should be brought to the notice of the United states authorities.   . i * *.Examination in United States of Shipping Prospects.Discussion then turned on the terms of the telegram to be sent by the Chiefs of Staff and the Ministry of War Transport to theJoint Staff Mission, in reply to J.S.M..883, about the shippingexamination now in progress in Washington. For the purpose of this examination it was necessary to arrive at a firm estimate of theshipping required for the United Kingdom import programme. our representatives in Washington had no authority to quote a lower figure than 27 million tons achieved imports as our irreducibleminimum requirements in 1943.&apos; The Shipping Committee had now put our import requirements for 1943 at 26-4 million tons. The latest estimate of the imports which-we expected to receive during the year was now 26 million tons. This represented 19 million tons to be imported in British-controlled ships, plus the United States offer of assistance of  million tons of dry imports. Which of these two figures shouldour representatives be authorised to quote ?The view of the War Cabinet was that they should beauthorised to quote the figure of 26 million tons. Unless this figure was adopted we should find ourselves in difficulties with the UnitedStates authorities, who argued that the estimate of imports to bebrought to this country in British-controlled ships was too low.Sailings to the Indian Ocean A rea.The next question discussed was whether the draft reply should include a sentence to the effect that, in order to make sure of even26 million tons of imports in 1943, we were considering whether we should have to adjust our sailings to the Indian Ocean area. this meant that we might have to reduce the figure of 66 ships a month to the Indian Ocean, on which we were working.The Paymaster-General argued that, unless a sentence to this effect was inserted, we should be committed in Washington to a programme of 66 ships a month.On the other hand, The Secretary of State for War urgedstrongly that we should not include a sentence to this effect. Evenon the basis of 66 ships a month, the military authorities in theMiddle East said that they were unable to provide adequately forthe maintenance of their existing-forces and for the equipment of units which had already been raised.The War Cabinet decided, on balance, in favour of theinclusion of a sentence on the lines suggested.The War Cabinet-, (1) Took note, with approval, of the Fifth Report of theShipping Committee, as giving the best estimate that could be framed of shipping prospects for 1943 on the assumptions set out in the Appendix, and subject to possible new. military demands for shipping which couldnot at present be foreseen Y; .(2) Endorsed the recommendations in paragraphs 17 and 18 ofthe Report (as to the appropriate share to be allocated to the Ministry of Food): and in paragraph 19 as tothe policy which should govern our stock position:

The Secretary of State for War said that there were anumber of Italian prisoners of war on the Aquitania, which was now in New York. A proposal had been made that they should bedisembarked and their places on the ship taken by members of theUnited States Army Air Force. The result would be to delay con-siderably the arrival in this country of these prisoners of war, whowere urgently needed in order to build hutted camps for furtherconsignments of Italian prisoners who were being brought to thiscountry. .   .The War Cabinet-Decided^that priority should be given to members of theUnited States Army Air Force.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,April 21,1943.
