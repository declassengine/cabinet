The Minister op Health, said tha  consideration had beengiven^th^ntattervand; rt^dheeh suggested that an amendment should be drafted which would secure that a, widow who was in-^^-ot^f^plemm^^ension by virtue of the provisions of,wause 3 of the B41 would not cease to he eligible for such a pensionby reason of the fact that she ceased to be entitled to an additional allowance in respect of a child. This concession should be limitedto widows, who were actually in receipt of a Supplementary pension at the time when they ceased to be entitled to an additional allowance in respect of a child.&apos;    So far as the terms of the Bill were concerned, the matter couldbe dealt with by an amendment on these lines.  It would howeveralso be necessary to modify the terms of the draft Financial-Resolution.The War Cabinet-Agreed that this matter should be dealt with on the lines proposed by the Minister of Health, and asked him toproceed accordingly.India. 2.

Cabinet on the previous day.(previous reference:W.M.(43) 70thConclusions,Minute 3.)The War CabinetsApproved the draft telegram, subject to certain drafting amendments agreed to in discussion. (The text of the telegram as approved is set out in the Annex to these minutes.)Government 3.   At their meeting on the 21st April the War Cabinet hadBuilding        invited the Minister of Production to frame proposals for allocatingProgramme.     to the various departmental programmes the building labour(Previous       available, under existing man-power decisions, for the six monthsReference:      April to September 1943.WM. (43) 57th       The War Cabinet now had before them-Conclusions, A Memorandum (W p  (43) 196) by the Minister ofinu e &apos;/ Production  submitting,  for consideration,  a scheme  for reducing the departmental allocations to correspond with the reduced total of building labour which would be available during that period if existing man-power decisions were maintained.A Memorandum (W.P. (43) 210) by the Secretary of Statefor Air regarding the effect of these proposals on the building programme of the Air Ministry.The following were the main points in discussion: (a) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the scheme&apos;! proposed by the Minister of Production would delay the completionof building work urgently needed by the Admiralty. He recognised,however, that the stringency of the man-power situation demandedsacrifices all round; and on that basis he was prepared to acceptthe proposed reductions in the building labour, available forAdmiralty work.(&amp;) The Secretary of State for War said that, if the reductionrequired had been secured by imposing a- pro rata cut on all departments, the War Office would have been able to start new building works to the value of about  5 million, of which about three-fifths would have been&quot;urgent War Office: works and two-fifths&quot; Bolero&quot;Works already sanctioned. The scheme proposed by theMinister of Production would involve suspending about 50 per cent.[25470-2] b 2 .. r I-/?.&apos; V&quot;.7V .v.&apos;.&quot;&apos;-V-*--.,*&apos;&apos;. ,J. - -.

of this * new programme; ahdj if the scheme were approved bythe War Cabinet^ he proposed to give instructions that anyconflict between urgent War Office work and workon the &apos;f Bolero &apos;&apos;programme should be resolved in favour of the former.;(c) The Secretary of.State for Air said that he could not accept&apos;the proposed cut in the labour force engaged on the building programme of the Air Ministry, unless there was some modificationof existing policy decisions affecting, in particular, the Anglo-American bomber offensive. As shown in paragraph 5 of his memorandum, the cuts proposed would have the result of delayingfrom September to November 1943 the completion of 34 new bomberstations and of essential extensions to 36 bomber stations-involving the. loss of accommodation at September next, as compared withprogramme, for 800 British and 900 American medium and heavy bombers. Though, he had shown in detail the effect on the bomberexpansion only, the cuts would result in similar delays in other partsof the Air Ministry building programme. It had been decided atthe Casablanca Conference that the build-up of the Anglo-Americanbomber offensive from the United Kingdom should have: equalpriority with the development of operations in other theatres.Until that decision was modified by the highest authority, in thelight of, advice from the Chiefs of Staff and the Combined Chiefsof Staff at Washington, hie could not accept any further reductionin the building labour available for the Air Ministry programme.(d) If the Air Ministry were to retain a larger labour force for building than that proposed by the Minister of Production, this could only be done at the expense of other building programmes orby reducing the number of men to be called up from the buildingindustry for service with the Forces.The Secretary of State for War said that, if there were anyfurther reduction in the rate of call-up for the Army, he couldnot discharge his responsibility for producing the forces requiredfor service overseas by the date at present specified. He already had indications that supply would fall short of his requirementsby about 75,000 men; and any further reduction must mean thatwe should be unable to meet our military commitments by the datesnow envisaged.Other Ministers emphasised the importance of avoiding anydislocation of existing arrangements for the call-up.(e) It was again suggested that substantial labour economiescould be secured by transfer to the Ministry of Works of a larger proportion of the departmental building programmes.The. War Cabinet were informed that the Lord presidents committee* had already decided that it was desirable, in principle,that responsibility for Government building should be concentrated,to the maximum practicable extent, in the Ministry of Works; andhad asked the Treasury to consider how this principle should beapplied, in the first instance, to the building work of the service departments.The Service Ministers doubted whether the labour economieslikely to be secured by this means would go far towards bridgingthe gap now under discussion. It was, however, the view of theMinister of Labour and NationalService and the Minister of Worksthat such transfers would result in substantial savings inman-power.The War Cabinet asked that these enquiries should be expedited.(/) It was suggested that the cost of the programme ofaerodrome construction, in terms, of materials and man-power,could he reduced, and the speed of construction increased, by accepting lower standards and by ^recourse to various technicalexpedients, e.g., greater use of pre:fabricated materials.1 &apos; * L.P. (43) 31st Meeting, Minute 2.
It:.was/.agreed that the programme should be examined fromthispointofviewbyv technical expertsworking in- association withrepresentatives of the Air Ministry. *(g) The requirements of United States Forces also represented&apos; a;heavy strain on the straitened resources of the building industry.Representations might be made to the United States government regarding the urgency Of securing some relief in this respect; bytheir (i) accepting reduced standards of. accommodation and(ii) sending over larger numbers of construction troops, so that theywould be in a position to undertake a larger proportion of their ownbuilding work.Other points raised in the discussion were (h) The proposed reduction in the labour force allocated tothe Ministry of War Transport might involve a serious deterioration in road surfaces. This would not only involve increased consump-tioh of rubber and petrol, but might even lead to some loss of efficiency.in transportation.It was agreed that, without prejudice to the allocationproposed, the Ministry of War Transport might discuss with theMinistry of Production .andthe War Office the possibility of devisingmeasures which might ease the situation.(i) The Minister of Production said that he had recommended,in paragraph 2 (c) of his Memorandum, that an additional 3,000men should be made available in England and Wales, from Julyonwards, for the emergency programme of rural cottages; and, inparagraph 2 (d), that comparable provision should be made for thecorresponding programme in Scotland. The Secretary of Statefor Scotland had informed him that on this basis the Scottishrequirement would be 1;000 men, instead of 500 as stated in his memorandum. He would discuss with the Secretary of State how the needs of this Scottish programme could best be met.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) The Minister of Production, in the light of the discussion and after consultation with the Secretary of State forAir and other Ministers concerned, would draw up astatement bringing out the conflict of interests whichhad arisen between the need of man-power for. theForces and the, building requirements arising from the.expansion of the British and United States AirForces. As soon as this statement was available, the deputy Prime Minister would arrange for the matter tobe brought before the Defence Committee; and, ifnecessary, for a communication to be sent to Washington.(2) The Lord President of the Council would expedite the enquiries which were being made regarding the transfer to the Ministry of Works of a larger share of thebuilding programmes of the Service Departments.(3)&apos;The Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of Workswould arrange for technical experts, in association withrepresentatives of the Air Ministry, to review the pro-grammes of aerodrome construction with a, view to seeingwhat further economies in man-power and materials,and what increase In speed of construction, could besecured by accepting lower constructional&apos; standards andby other technical devices.(4) The Minister of Production, in consultation with theSecretary of State for War and other Ministers con-cerned, would prepare a statement showing, the urgentimportance Of relieving the strain on our building resources by securing the agreement of the United states authorities, (i) to accept -lower, standards of accommoda-tion for United States troops and (ii) to undertake, by united States military labour, a iarger proportion ofthis building work. This statement should be prepared in a form suitable for communication to the UnitedStates Government;! but before it was so comthe Chiefs of Staff should be consulted.
Pending reference to the Defence ;Comniitte on the questionset out -at(1) above (which would&apos;beidone ;with the least possible delay) the calling up of men for the Forces would continue oh the basis&apos; of existing man-power decisions and, as regards withdrawal of men from the buildingindustry, on the basis of the scheme set out inWP. (43) 196.Offices- of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,May 19, 1943..   ANNEX. &apos;Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy.Personal. Gandhi. War Cabinet have considered your telegram 1159 S,and are very definitely of opinion, shared by the Prime Minister, that Gandhi&apos;sletter should not go forward. The ground given should be the simple one thatthe Government, while most anxious to promote agreement between Hindus andMoslems, and other political elements, are not prepared1 to give facilities for political correspondence or contact to a person in detention for promoting anillegal mass movement which he has not disavowed, thus gravely embarrassingIndia&apos;s War effort at a critical time. In view of the indications contained inyour latest telegram that leakage may well already be taking place, the Cabinetconsider that the fact that a letter has been written and withheld should be made public and should be justified in substantially the above terms in such manner as you think most suitable, after communication to ypur Council as well as to Jinnahand Gandhi.
