(previous reference:W.M. (43) 66thConclusions;Minute 5.)1. The War; Cabinet had before them a- Note by the PrimeMinister covering telegrams exchanged between M. Stalin and himself on Russo-Polish relations (W.P. (43) 175). A telegramfrom President Roosevelt to the Prime - Minister, dated the26th April, on this subject was also read to the War Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that the recent development in thesituation, resuming, in.the decision of the Soviet Government to sevejydiplomatic relations with the Polish Government in London, migh^have \ serious, consequences. Unless the breach could be healed,there was. a risk that the difficulties between the Russians andPoles might extend to other issues and that the breach might bewidened. The Prime Minister said that he and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs had just seen General Sikorski. ThePolish Government had intended to issue a communique&quot; thaievening in terms&apos; which would have exacerbated the situation. TheGeneral had agreed to defer issue of the communique&quot; ^and toconsider the matter further. A further meeting had been arranged for the following afternoon, to which the General had undertaken to bring a revised draft communique. The Prime Minister saidthat he had emphasised to the Polish representatives that the rightline was to ignore what had happened or might have happenedbefore the Russo-Polish Treaty, and that what now mattered wasto concentrate, on improving relations for the future, and on gettingpermission for the Polish troops in Russia and for their families toleave that country.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s view, but that he thought that GeneralSikorski would be under very strong pressure to take a line whichwould make matters more difficult. He also thought that the possi-bility should not be ignored that M. Stalin might say that, if good relations were to be re-established with the Poles, a settlement mustbe reached now on the future boundaries between Poland and russia. It was.perhaps conceivable that the Russians might seek to set up an alternative Polish Government under their influence.He thought that we could not possibly acquiesce in such a course,which would have a most detrimental effect on post-war inter-national relations.Discussion/then turned on steps to avoid any exacerbation ofthe present difficult situation. The Minister of Information saidthat&apos; he would ask the Press not to canvass the issue or to take sides;but the situation was not free from difficulty. On the one hand,some sections of the Press might be urged by the RussianAmbassador to take a certain line. On the other hand, it was also necessary to consider the journals run by the Polish Government inthis country,&apos;? The Prime Minister said that, in his view,, no Governmentwhich had accepted our hospitality had any right to publish articlesof a character which conflicted with the general policy of the united nations and which would create difficulties for this Government.Nor should any of these Governments use the broadcast in away,which would have the same results. He thought that the present;position in this matter called for some tightening up. ,The War Cabinet expressed general agreement with this view.&apos;..;; ;,The&apos; War. Cabinet&apos;s conditions were;-as follows: (1).., The Minister of Information was invited to ask the british press not to canvass the Russo-Polish quarrel or to take,sides.in it.(2) Thie Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was invitation^d to!   speak&apos;to M.

The Chiefs of Staff reported the, principal events of theweek. i&apos;.&apos;1^ ,V..\&apos;o,,;:;.The attack on the Pilsen works had&apos;not been successful, mostof the bombs falling on a built-up area 6 miles&apos; away. In the past week Bomber Command had carried but brie raid on Stettin and one- - on- Duisberg.&apos; &apos;j l^^0^^h0i- been tlie&apos; heaviest raid since the firstbig raid on Cologne.Forty attacks had been made by Coastal Command on U-boats,of which two had been  successful and eleven were promising. two enemy merchant ships had been torpedoed off Norway.United States aircraft had not been  able to operate on accountof bad weather. Enemy losses in the Home Theatre for the weekhad been 8. destroyed and 6 damaged. Our losses had been53 bombers; 8 fighters and 2 Coastal Command aircraft.In the Mediterranean theatre,&apos;Allied Air Forces had had thebest week of the war. In the course of 8,700 sorties enemy losses were reported as 256 destroyed, 38 probably destroyed and99 damaged! We had lost 68 destroyed and 59 damaged. Includedin the enemy&apos;s losses were 110 transport aircraft, the loss of whichhad greatly reduced the enemy&apos;s transport aircraft sorties.Shipping losses by enemy action for.the previous week had been34,000 tons. .The basis of the German claim to have sunk the United states aircraft-carrier Ranger was thought to be an unsuccessful attack onthe auxiliary aircraft-carrier Biter.In the Mediterranean 7 merchant ships had been sunk by our submarines, together with 1 tanker, and 7 smaller ships. TwoS Class submarines had been lost during the week. One Turkishsubmarine, built in England and retained for use by us; had alsobeen lost. &apos; ,-The. operations in Tunisia were continuing satisfactorily,though there was very hard fighting on all sectors. In the weekending the 25th April 2,600 prisoners of war had been taken andour casualties had been about 2,400 killed, wounded and missing.General Alexander had reported signs of weakening in the german resistance, but there was no sign of any German evacuation.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the Chief of theImperial General Staff said that he would enquire why GeneralMontgomery had found it necessary to go to Cairo at this junctureand why news of his visit had been published.The Prime Minister observed that the 50th Division had been relieved from the line in order to return to Egypt as a preliminary to future operations. He thought that this move should not takeplace until the Outcome of the present battle&apos;was certain.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to ensurethat the 50th Division would remain available for as long, as necessary.There was no news of iinportance from the Russian front.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements,   ftJKeffageeb.(previous reference:&quot;W.M; (43) &apos;48thConclusions,Minute&apos; 7.)3. The Secretary .pf State for Foreign Affairs said that atelegram had been received from pur; Delegation to the RefugeeConference in Bermuda, reporting that the United States delegatessaid that it would be, helpful if we;could offer to take into thiscountry several hundred stateless refugees. In recent years our policy had been only to admit to this country certain very limitedcategories of stateless refugees.
TheiSeeretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposed that ourdelegatesshouldbe authorised; to tell the United States delegatesthat we should be prepared to make an effort to admit a number ofstateless refugees to this country, provided that the United States&quot;were prepared &quot;to do the same.The War Cabinet- J. Agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,.      should send a communication in this sense.Anti-aircraft command.Reduction in&apos;Strength&apos;.:&apos;,4. The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of a Memo-randum by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (43) 161) reporting that it hadbeen found possible to effect a reduction in the strength of the:;AjitiTAircraft Command. Notwithstanding this reduction, bymeans of certain expedients, such as the greater use of the home guard, it should be possible to provide approximately the same degree of A.A. defence for this country in .1943 as was provided in1942, taking into account the greater number of points now to be defended.Home Guard.Celebration ofThirdAnniversary.1 .(previous references:W.M. (43) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4; andW.M. (43) 57thConclusions, &quot;Minute 3.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (43) 172) summarising thearrangements proposed for the celebration of the third anniversary of the formation of the Home Guard.The Secretary of State for War said that His Majesty had intimated his readiness to take the salute at the march-past in hyde park. No final decision had, however, as yet been reached on theproposal that the Home Guard should mount guard at buckingham palace in celebration of the anniversary.Arrangements were being made* for certain contingents from outside London to take part in the main parade and march-past inHyde Park.The War Cabinet-TOok note, with approval, of the arrangements made forthe celebration of this anniversary, subject to the modifi-cations referred to by the Secretary of State for War.Air Services.Middle East.(previous reference:W.M..(42) 138thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W,P. (43) 163) summarising thecurrent arrangements for air-mail services to troops overseas. Theconclusion of the Memorandum was. that, in order to maintain an efficient and satisfactory air-mail service to and from His Majesty&apos;forces overseas, an overriding first priority should be allotted for aircraft to carry troops&apos; mail regularly when and where required,up to the agreed allotment of 12,000 lbs. weekly in each direction,including an extension of the North African service to Cairo, so asto give flexibility.The Secretary of State for War said that the Memorandum wasnot, of course, intended in any way as a criticism of the arrange-ments made by the Air Ministry. The War Office were most grateful for the steps which had been taken to make available the agreed allotment of ciapacity of 12,000 lbs. weekly. But the fact remained that provision of this capacity had not been allottedoverriding priority.The Secretary of State for Air said that such an overridingpriority was, in effect,formally prescribed.provided for troop mails, although notThe Secretary of State, for the Colonies said that there hadbeen a further increase in the volume of troop air mails since thefigures in this paper had been compiled. There was no longer any
subgtailtial balance the allotment of12,000 lbs. -weekly, arid - an increase; in the allotment might benecessary before long. i *The Prime Minister em^ importance of an adequateservice from the point of view of morale.The War Cabinet-&apos;  ; Took. note of the Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War and of the points raised in discussion.The FightingServices.Supply of books and Magazines.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 148thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (43) 164) reviewing the progress made during the past six months in arranging for the supply of books arid magazines for the Forces, and putting forward thefollowing proposals for remedying the present shortage of readingmatter for the Forces-(i) that arrangements should be made for the publication ofa weekly Army magazine, for which an annual allocation of 520 tons Of paper would be required; and ! *(ii) that&quot; during the remainder of 1943 a special allocation of paper should be made, at the rate of 200 tons a quarter,for the production by the trade of books and magazinesfor the Forces.&apos; Discussion centred round the proposed production of a weeklymagazine for the Army.The War Cabinet were informed that, at the present time, theArmy relied largely on two periodicals, The United ServicesMdgazine and Mighty, both of which were distributed free to theForces through official channels. Neither of these periodicals was,in desirable hands. In the case of one, it had already been decidedthat the privilege of free distribution must be withdrawn, and itwas possible that before very long a similar decision might have tobe taken in respect of the other. The proposal for an official Armymagazine was put forward largely with a view to filling the gapwhich would be created if both these periodicals ceased to beavailable to the Forces.It was suggested that, if any official magazine were producedfor the Forces, it should cater for all three Services and net for the^Army alone. The general feeling of the War Cabinet was, however,that it would be inexpedient to produce such an official magazine.It was doubtful whether a periodical produced under official,auspices would be successful, and it would be subject to continualcriticism on the basis that the Government accepted responsibilityfor its contents and views. Would it not be preferable to invite the newspapers to coxoperate in arranging for the production of aspecial periodical for the Forces?The Minister of Information pointed put that the existingnewspapers and magazines differed very widely in character andpolitical butlpok, and it was unlikely that their proprietors could be persuaded to co-operate in a joint plan for the provision of a specialperiodical for the Forces.. He suggested that^ if any additionalpaper could be made available for such a purpose, it would be put to better use iri: providing for the Forces additional copies ofexisting newspapers and periodicals. * &apos;The War Cabinets       -(1) Invited the Secretary of; State for War, in consultationwith the Minister of Information arid Lord Portal, toconsider what arrangements could be made for making available to &apos;all three Services increased numbers of&apos;existingnewspapersarid periodicals,        by making
additional allocations of newsprint and paper on condition that a corresponding number of newspapersand magazines were supplied for use by members ot the(2) Affr^eTin principle that there should be some^ additionalW   Allocation of paper for the production by the trade of.        books for the Services; and asked that ^specificProposal made on this point in W.P. (43V164 should be reviewed in relation to the enquiry at (1) above by theMinisters invited to undertake that enquiry.8. The War Cabinet considered a* Memorandum by theMinister of Economic Warfare (W.P. (43) 156) - regardingGermany&apos;s use of credits to finance her imports of munitions from neutral countries.The Minister suggested that he should be authorised to open discussions with Allied Governments with a view to the issue of apublic declaration by the United Nations that such credits were of direct benefit to the German war effort and would not be recognised as claims &apos; in the post-war settlement. Meanwhile, however, hesuggested that some immediate action was required to deter the swiss Government, who had sent a delegation to Berlin to negotiate a new trade agreement, from granting fresh credits to germany with a view to securing imports of coal and oil to Switzerland. he therefore asked for authority to inform the Swiss (and any otherneutrals who might be contemplating the grant of new credits toGermany) that this matter was being considered by -the united nations and that, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, anycredits granted during the war and outstanding at its end would beregarded either as bad debts or as ranking below the Allied claims for reparations for war damage, and that in no circumstances wouldwe assist in the collection of such debts to neutrals and satellites ofGermany.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Chancellorof the Exchequer thought there would be difficulties in the way ofa public declaration by the United Nations, and suggested that thisproposal should be further discussed between the Departmentsconcerned before any approach was made to Allied Governments onthe lines indicated in W.P. (43) 156. They saw no objection,however, to the proposal that a private warning in suitable terms should be conveyed to the Swiss Government on the general lines indicated in paragraph 6 (a) of W.P. (43) 156, though there werevarious suggestions which they would wish to put to the Ministerof Economic Warfare regarding the terms of this warning.. Asimilar warning might be given privately to any other neutralGovernment which might in future be contemplating the grant ofnew credits to Germany.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a private warning should be given to the swiss government on the lines indicated in paragraph 6 (a)of W.P. (43) 156.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to settle the precise terms of this communication in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Economic Warfare. &apos;(3) Agreed in principle that a warning in similar terms mightbe given privately to any other neutral Governmentwhich might in future be contemplating the grant of new&apos;     credits to Germany.;Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1, -April 27, 1943.
