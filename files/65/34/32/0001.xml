The general view takenBeference:      had been that, in view of the interest shqwn, a War Cabinet MinisterW.M. (43) 77th should be the principal ^Government spokesman in the Debate on conclusions,    Tuesday, the 1st June.   The Deputy Krhne Minister, had agreedMinute&apos;5.)      to undertake this task. As certain questions were likelylto be raised as to recent appointments to the British Oversea^ airways corporation, it had been suggested that the ^Icretaryrot State forAir should wind-up on behalf of the Government;  ^he Ministerof Aircraft ^Production had undertaken to furnish a statement, tobe used in the Debate, as to the progress being made in regard to the design and construction of civil aircraft.:   -The Deputy PrimeM^proposed to take; namely, that air -transport after the war was amatter which must be dealt with as ah issue affecting the wholeBritish Commonwealth and Empire; that we were already inconsultation with the Dominions, and that proposals were beingmade to them as to the next step. At the same time it was important to avoid creating the impression that we were trying to form a united front against the United States in this matter.The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of these arrangements.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,27 th May, 1943.
litoMOST SECRET NO circulation.-M.(43) 78th:CONCLUSIONS , ,(Thursday, 27th May, 1943.)&apos; THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS informed theWar Cabinet that a member of the staff of the Portuguese embassy had &quot;been found to &quot;be carrying out espionage; for the enemy.The Embassy had waived any claim to diplomatic privilege andhad dismissed the man, whereupon he had been arrested and triedunder the Treachery Act and condemned to death, the trialbeing held in camera.The Portuguese Government had asked that the death penalty should not be carried out, and had indicated that theywere ready to do what they could to clear up the Germanespionage ring in Lisbon.     He had discussed the matter withthe Foreign Secretary, and after full consideration had reachedthe conclusion that it would be in the public interest tocommute the death sentence, seeing that we should thereby *obtain the good will of the Portuguese Government in rootingout German espionage from their country.It was the usual practice, in cases where the death&apos;sentence had been imposed after a trial in camera, to make some public statement giving the result of the trial andsuch of the facts of the case as could safely be disclosed;and in this particular case the Judge, before agreeing to hear the case in camera, had asked, for and had received anaistaurance that such a public statement woixld be made.     as things had turned out, however, it would be difficult to makeany public announcement at this juncture since a convincing-explanation of the commutation of sentence could not be given without revealing matters which it was in the public interestshould be kept secret.      On the whole, notwithstanding the obvious objections to not publishing the results of trialsheld in secret, he was against making any public statement.This view met with the general approval of the WarCabinet.      It was pointed out that the objections to withholdingany public statement regarding the results of such trialsapplied with far less force where the death sentence had beencommuted.      As the prisoner had been reprieved., it would bepossible to make some nublic announcement at a later date, when-She facts could be made known without detriment to the publicinterest.Offices of. the War Cabinet,S.W. 1. ,27th May, 1943.
