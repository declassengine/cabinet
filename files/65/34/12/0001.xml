J*$^a^ l   At their meeting on the 8th ApfciJ.the War, Cabinet hadcpnunewslal      appoHfl^:;aV:Comhlftte^:;^ the ChancellorPoiloy. of the Exchequer, to consider further in the light of the War(Previous Cabinet&apos;s discussion the proposals put forward on the subject ofReference::v^ post-war commercial policy, and to recommend the procedure and;W:m7 (4sy:50th time-table to be followed in arranging for these proposals1 to1 b&apos;eConclusions, discussed with the Governments^ of the Dominions, the united minute l.)       Statesland the other United Nations..The War Cabinet now had before them a MemorSndtftfi(W.P. (43) 168) by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, setting out, in. the form of three draft telegrams to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador&apos; atWashington and a draft telegram to Dominion Governments, theconclusions reached by this Committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his Committee were agreed that it would be preferable not to Open discussions on thissubject with the United States Government until there had been an exchange of views With the Db^iniofl:; Governments. They therefore suggested that ah outline of the proposals should be sent forthwith to Dominion Governments, who should be invited to send experts to this couhiry asvSic^\asN.^o^ib!e&apos;&apos;ftiF: an exchange of viSws withour Experts, ii was fefcbgnised, hbwevef; that a situation might arise in which we might be forced to give the United States Govern-ment a provisional indication of our views, even though these consultations with Dominion&apos; Governments had not been completed.Fof that reason it was proposed to&apos; send His Majesty&apos;s&quot; ambassador at Washington an aide-memoire which; in suchNan event, he mightpreseht to\ the Secretary of State,, together with a note of severalpoints which he should make orally when coinmunicatingthe aide-m^ffioire to Mr. Hull. The draft telegrams made it clear that,unless our hand was forced, we should not wish this approach to bemade until after the exchange of views with Dominion Govern-jffifents; and that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should give us early warning if a situation seemed likely to develop which would forceus to act before those consultations had been completed.The Secretary of. State for India had. suggested that the draft telegrams might be amended to make it clear that the Governmentof India as well as the Dominion&apos; Governments should be invited to&apos;send an expert to this country for consultation. This suggestion was accepted;The War.Cabinet-* . Apprdved the te$ms of the5 draft telegrams annexed toW.P.

It was regrettable that these figures; which, of course, were.   based in part on secret information given by us to the United StatesGovernment, should have been disclosed without any prior consul-&apos;:        . tation with British authorities.   It might be desirable that theUnited States Administration should walfi ftteCommittee that, if

It was understood, that someairmen1. 6i these airmen had been&apos; executed and others sentenced to imprison-. -ment.  The United States Government had lodged a protest withthe Japanese Government through the Swiss Minister in Tokyo.The Prime Minister proposed to send to the appropriate UnitedStates authority a suitable message qf sympathy, in the course ofwhich he would take the Opportunity of saying that the R.A.F. andother British Forces were looking forward to the time when theycould join with the United States Forces in avenging on theJapanese this brutal treatment of prisoners of war.The War Cabinet-Took note,  with approval,N of  the Prime Ministersv - proposal.Pood        vConference.(previous reference:W.M: (43)&apos;53rdConclusions,Minute 1.)(previous reference:W.M.

More detailed instructions would be drawn up by theDepartments concerned in regard to particular matters within the framework of this general policy. The policy was summed up inparagraph 24.General agreement was expressed with the draft Instructions,discussion centring round the question whether our representatives should be empowered to announce our willingness to continuerationing after the war during the period of stringency, in respectof which it was our policy to press for co-ordinated production,purchase, shipping and allocation. /The War Cabinet were reminded that this matter had beendiscussed on the 5th January, when the Prime Minister had under-taken to ascertain the Presidents views on this matter at theCasablanca Conference. At that time the President had been opposed to the idea of a Joint Declaration, or, indeed, of any declaration at the present time (W.P. (43) 43).The Prime Minister was of opinion that we ought not to act inthis matter in advance of the United States.;The Lord President of the Council said that it was proposedthat Mr. Law; M.P., now at Bermuda for the Refugee Conference,should lead the Delegation. There Would also be a number of departmental representatives, some of whom would be Delegatesand others Experts. While a provisional division betweenDelegates and Experts would be made before leaving this country,a final decision on this point would be left to Mr. Law.The War Cabinefs Conclusions were as follows: .; (1) The arrangements. in, regard to the composition of the,J  &quot;* :* Delegation .were&quot;, approved,&apos;
