A successful attack had been made on Dortmund, inwhich 1;570 tons of bombs had been; dropped: Coastal command had made 2 promising&apos; arid 8;pbssible attacks ori U-boats. enemy losses for the week had been 18 destroyed; 4 prbbahly destroyed and13 damaged. Our losses had been 43 bombers, 9 fighters and&apos;7 Coastal Command aircraft.; United States Air Forces had attacked the Ford Works, atAntwerp, successfully.In the Mediterranean enemy losses had been 95 destroyed(46 on the ground), 10 probably destroyed and 28 damaged.Including United States aircraft, our losses had been 37 destroyed and 77 damaged. Our bombers had attacked Italian and Sicilianports and had supported the land operations. In addition, 3 large and 9 small merchant vessels had been sunk.In a bombing attack on Darwin the Japanese had lost 6 aircraft destroyed, 4 probably destroyed and 9 damaged.  Our total losses had been 13 fighters; but only 7 had been shot down in combat; therest had been lost owing to bad weather conditions.  Ten pilots had; been saved.Shipping losses by. enemy action during the previous week,including belated reports, had been 74,494 tons.In the Mediterranean our submarines and destroyers had sunk 7,000-ton munition ship, 2 destroyers, 2 small merchant ships, aschooner and a barge loaded with troops. All available small naval vessels Were now being used for patrol work in the Sicilian. Narrows.An outward-bound Atlantic convoy had been heavily attacked by-U-boats on the 4th and 5th May. Out of some 42 ships, 9 or 10had been sunk. The escort had made vigorous attacks on &amp;lieu-boats, sinking 5 of them, with the result that the attacks on the convoy had ceased. The Prime Minister had sent congratulatorymessages to the officers in charge of the escort and of the convoy.Our small craft had picked up 12 survivors from 2 U-boats,one of which had been sunk by Coastal Command aircraft and theother by ramming.The operations in Tunisia were described. Following the fall of Bizerta and Tunis, the enemy was putting up a stiff resistance in the neighbourhood of Hamman Lif, and we had made little progress against them up till the previous evening. There had been no reports of the retreat of the First Italian Army, which wasfacing the front of the Eighth Army. The-administrative situation of the enemy was desperate and they would have extreme difficultyin maintaining themselves in the Cap: Bon Peninsula. It was estimated that there were still about 100,000 Axis troops in Tunisia.Our forces in Burma had withdrawn a few miles fromButhidaung.The War Cabinet-Took note of the above statements and decided thatcongratulatory messages should be sent in their name toGenerals Eisenhower and Alexander, Air Vice-MarshalTedder and Admiral Cunningham.Air Pollen(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet, while agreeing that it wouldbe inexpedient for the Minister of Information to offer any advice to, this newspaperj thought that for the time being effect should notbe given to the decision of the Lord Presidents Committee that the-ban on the export of the Daily Worker should be lifted.Film of&quot;Colonial(previous reference:W.M. (42) 126thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Secretary of State for War said that the film had nowbeen seen by representatives of the War Office and the Ministry ofInformation, who took the view that it was unlikely to attract much attention or to have any undesirable consequences on the discipline of the Army. In the circumstances, he had reached the conclusionthat the right plan was to allow the film to be shown.The War Cabinet Endorsed this view.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43) 193) covering thereport agreed by the United Kingdom and United States Delega-tions to the Bermuda Conference on the refugee problem.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the mostimportant of the recommendations made by the Conference were (i) The recognition that the refugee problem could not be solved by the United States and Great Britain alone, butconcerned the whole community of civilised nations; andthat Allied and neutral Governments should be invitedto share in the relief of these refugees,(ii The proposal to establish a temporary camp in north africa to relieve the immediate pressure on Spain,(iii) The proposal to revive the Intergovernmental Committeeon  Refugees which was  appointed by  the  EvianConference.The Conference had been a marked success, and it wasgratifying that the co-operation of the two Delegations had been socordial and effective.:   Points made in discussion were : (a) There were signs of increasing anti-Semitic feeling in thiscountry. From this point of view, it would.be preferablein public statements to avoid implying that refugeeswere necessarily Jewish and to refer to refugees bynationality rather than by race.(6) Reference was made to the statement in the draft declara-tion (reproduced ini Annex: B of the Report) that&apos;neutral governments should be assured that they would no beexpected to.maintain refugees in their territory for an indefinite period;   /It was explained that the intention was that all allied Governments should undertake to facilitate the&apos;     return after the war of refugees originating from theirRefugees.Report fromBermuda .Conference.(previous reference:&quot;W.M, (43) 59thConclusions,Minute 3.)
territories. As regards enemy territories, we could only do our best to ensure that conditions were created in those territories which would enable refugees to return to them.

(c) It was agreed that no public statement should be made at this stage regarding the number of additional refugees whom we might be willing to receive into this country, at any rate until a decision had been reached on the question of a temporary camp in North Africa.

(d) The Secretary of State for India drew attentiion to an inaccuracy in paragraph 14 of the Report. It was there stated that India was taking 5,000 Polish refugees. In fact, India had undertaken to receive 11,000 refugees.

The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that he had observed a number of small inaccurancies in the Report. He need not trouble the War Cabinet with these, but would let the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs have a note of them for purposes of record.

The War Cabinet-

(1) Accepted the Report of the Delegates to the Bermuda Conference.

(2) Agreed that in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons the opening statement on behalf of the Government the opening statement on behalf of the Government should be made by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, and that a senior Minister should reply to the debate. In view of the risk that a disproportionate number of the speeches might be by Members holding extreme views in favour of the free admission of refugees to this country, the Whips were invited to arrange that some Members would intervene in the debate who would put a more balanced point of view.



North Africa. Celebration of Victory.



6. The War Cabinet considered a suggestion that the bells should be rung and a Thanksgiving Service held on the following Sunday to celebrate the victory of the Gulf of Tunis.

The War Cabinet-

Decided that this had better be deferred until enemy resistance in the Cap Bon Peninsula had been crushed, bearing also in mind that a special Thankgiving Service on the following Sunday would conflict with the celebration of the Home Guard Anniversary already arranged.





Church Bells (Previous Reference W.M. (43) 56th Conclusions, Minute 10.)



The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that an Order had been made which permitted the Church bells to be rung on Sundays, Good Friday, and Christmas Day to summon people to Church. A special Order would be necessary to allow the bells to be rung for any other purpose. He was already being questioned as to whether Church bells could be rung for services on week days, and it was for consideration before long whether the Order which limited the ringing of Church bells should not be entirely revoked.


Parliamentary 7.   The War Cabinet discussed the business of the House onBnslnesB. : ,; the; following.^day;, and :agreed that the Deputy Prime MinisterStatement on should make a short statement on thef victory in Tunisia. It wasVictory in -hot thought that; the statement:need be. followed -by.- discussion, butTunisia. it was desirable to give the House an opportunity of expressing theirthanks tq, the troops. ,*Workmen&apos;s , Attention was drawn to a Question for answer by the PrimeCompensation:   Minister oh the following day, asking whether he would give timefor discussion p&apos;f a Motion calling upon the Government to take stepsto raise by 50 per cent, the rates1 of Workmen&apos;s Compensationprovided for in the 1925 Act.The view taken was that, while it might be desirable to allowopportunity for discussion of the position in regard to Workmen&apos;compensation in the House before long, the time was not yet ripe;moreover, when this discussion took place it would probably notoe&apos;       on the Motion referred to in this Parliamentary Question.   the reply given should therefore be to the effect that no hope could beheld out at present that time could be afforded for discussion of thissubject.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,May 10, 1943.
MOST SECRET.10 CIRCULATION.W.M.(45) 67TH CONCLUSIONS.(10th May, 1943 -   5,30 p.m. )russo-POLISHRELATIONS,,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS;read to the War Cabinet two telegrams which he hadreceived from the Prime Minister (PENCIL Nos. 22 and23) about the reply which he proposed to send to the telegram received from Premier Stalin (ALCOVE No* 42).The former telegram gave the Prime Minister1 s generalreactions to Premier Stalin1 s telegram, and thelatter contained the text of the Prime Minister&apos;draft reply, in respect of which he asked for theForeign Secr&apos;etaryrs comments.&quot;THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the PrimeMinister had not asked him to consult the War Cabineton the terms of the draft reply to Premier Stalin,As, however, he was not in agreement with thePrime Minister&apos;s draft, he thought it was right thathe should ascertain the views of his colleagues beforereplying to the Prime Minister,The Foreign Secretary also thought thatthe Prime Minister&apos;s draft reply had been prepared be-fore he (the Prime Minister) had received the telegramreporting the Foreign Secretary&apos;s interview withMo Maisky on May 6th,The Foreign Secretary said that he was apprehensive of the paragraph in the Prime Minister&apos;draft which virtually committed us to bring aboutchanges in the Polish Government,   He handed roundcopies of a draft reply which he proposed to send,,(A copy is annexed to this Minute).The Foreign Secretary&apos;s draft met withgeneral approval, subject to the second paragraphbeing modified to read as follows?-&quot;The Poles did not tell us what they were going to do.   So we could not warn them of the peril of the course they were goingto take,&quot;Some minor amendments were proposed in thefourth    paragraph.It was also felt that the fifth paragraphrequired amendment.   We knew that the RussianGovernment were taking the line that those who came from the part of Poland East of the Molotov-Ribbentrop frontier were now Russian citizens and itwould therefore be dangerous to express gratitude forthe information that it was not the policy of theSoviet Government to put obstacles in the way of theexit, of &quot;Polish subjects&quot; in U,S,S.R,   In substancethe reply should take note of this information but should not commit us by Implication to acceptance ofthe Russian views on this point.The   Foreign Secretary undertook to amend thedraft on the lines indicated in the discussion,te telescam^as, amended .was despatched as
