He proposed todeal withthe matter in reply to a Parlia-mentary Question on Wednesday, on much the same lines as&apos;Mr;-&quot; Hull, who had stated that he could &apos;only.-repeat what&apos; thePresident and other leaders of the United Nations had said, namely,that they Were determined on the unconditional surrender of the axis and its satellites.Admiral Esteva.     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to atelegram from the Resident Minister at Algiers asking what was-  His Majesty&apos;&amp; Government&apos;^ attitude in regard to Admiral Esteva,: Resident-General in Tunis.  Should we be willing, if the Admiralwas found in Tunis when we had driven out the enemy, that heshould be regarded as available for a Command ?It was pointed out that a number of the Admiral&apos;s actions-would require explanation. Moreover, the question whether heshould receive a French naval appointment would be primarily one. for the French themselves. But, in view of what had passed, noreason was seen why any representative of i this country should support the Admiral&apos;s claims to an appointment.&apos; The War Cabinet-Agreed that a reply on these lines would be appropriate.Russo Polish The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the PolesRelations. were greatly upset about the statement put out by the Germans(Previous alleging the discovery at Smolensk of a grave containing the corpsesReference: Qf large numbers of Polish officers.   The Secretary of State for w.M.

(43) 44thConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on thissubject by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (WrP. (43) 166).The German Government had now replied to the proposal putforward by the Swiss Government in 1942 (see W.P. (42) 409) forthe repatriation of sick and seriously wounded prisoners of war and civilians from the British Empire and from Germany. The main points made in their reply were--(a) AH civilians to be included, regardless of age or sexysavepersons whose repatriation is considered to be dangerous to the security of the detaining -(b) Merchant seamen to be regarded as civilians, unless inactive military service when taken prisoner,(c) The exchange to take place on the basis of numericalequality and without regard to the. categories to which.the different repatriated persons belong.The ^Secretaryof Statefor Foreign Affairs recommended thatwe should inform the Swiss Government that we agreed to (a) and(c) above, but not to (&amp;); and that we should at the same time makedefinite proposals for beginning the exchange, through the two ports-pf Lisbon &quot;and;Stoyrna.&apos;&apos;;-      &quot; &apos;*&apos;:-.        -&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;... The main point, of principle was whether we should waive ourrights, under1 the Geneva Conventions and accept the German offer, of exchange on the basis of numerical equality. So long as Germanyheld: more British prisoners of all kinds-than-we did, there was no prospect that Germany would, agree, to exchange en. any other basis.-The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that, in replying to the..Swiss. Government, we should&apos; make it clear that-we were entitled-under the terms of the Conventions todeiaiand the exchange&quot;,of,:. eer tain - categories. ol pri aoners without; regard to numbers; -but&quot;that, having made uha, ncoit:on clear, we should accept the: offer of&apos;D&amp;UiaUDo Ull due Ui n-u W Ai.&apos;iUoJL JtljCi &amp;Ui 1x114 uy.
The War Cabinet^(1) Approved the proposals put forward in ; W.P.(43) 166, onh --;j^-jindei^riding:-that&apos; the -reply to the Swiss. Govern-&apos;ment would iUblude a clear statement of bur right underthe Conventions to1 insist -that .certain categories; ofPrisoner should be exchanged,without regard to numbers.(2)Took nbte tnat;t^ Foreign Affairs, would mform the XJhited Stated Government of the terms: 1     of the reply which was being sent to the swiss government. /(3) Agreed that merchant seamen should be excluded from the;; exehange^-unless sick or seriously wounded;;&apos;Proxy 9-   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMarriages. Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P.&apos;(43). 151)regarding the suggestion that the law should be amended to enablemen serving with the Forces abroad to marry women in this country by proxy.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security stated thatthis suggestion had been put forward in Parliament, but he doubted whether it commanded any strong support. The Service Depart-. ments did not desire such a change in the law, The arguments forand against the change were summarised in his memorandum. his conclusion was that the balance of arguments was against allowingmarriage by proxy, and he recommended that an announcement tcthis effect should be made in Parliament.The Secretary of State for Scotland was in agreement with thisview.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the conclusion of the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security as set out in paragraph 7 of w.P.(43) 151.Church Bells.(previous reference:W\M. (43) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6.)Road signs andimmobilisationof vehicles.,10. The War Cabinet considered a Note by the Prime Ministerand Minister of Defence (W. P. (43) 155 (Revise)) recommending,with the concurrence of the Chiefs of Staff, that the present restrictions on the ringing of church bells should be so modified asto enable the bells to be rung on Sundays and other special days, to summon worshippers to church, in all parts of the country outsidethe Regulated Areas.The Lord President of the Coimcil - pointed out that theRegulated Areas (as had been made clear in the recent public announcement) were related to our offensive preparations and notto the invasion risk. It was not, therefore, particularly suitablethat special restrictions in respect of the ringing of church.bellsshould )be ,retained in.these areas. : On the other hand, it was proposed shortly, to announce that certain other restrictions related to the invasion risk (i.e., requirements about rbad signs and the/immobilisation of vehicles) would - in future apply only in the areasmost exposed to the risk of. invasion, whichvysrere not in all respects the same as the Regulated Areas. *&apos;Hp&apos; therefore suggested that thesame areas should be prescribed for the purposes of the Orderrelating to the ringing of church bells, i.e., that the full restriction on the ringing of church.bells should be retained only in those areasin which the restrictions as regards road signs and the immobilisa--tion of vehicles were to be retained.Discussion showed that the general view of the War cabinet favoured the modification of i the restriction on ringing of churchbells uniformly throughout the country. ; On the other hand, some
doubt was expressed as to the expediency of relaxing in inland areas the restrictions regarding road signs and the immobilisation of vehicles. These were now retained -primarily to increase thedifficulties of any small enemy parties landed by parachute; and this risk was not greater in the coastal areas than inland. It wassuggested that these proposals should be further considered and thatthe views of the Chiefs of Staff should be obtained.The War Cabinet-(1) Decided that the present restrictions on the ringing ofchurch bells should be so modified as to enable the bellsto be rung in all parts of the country on Sundays and&apos; other special days, to summon worsnippers to church-(2) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security to arrange for this decision to be announced inParliament in the near future, and to be put into effect in time for the celebration of Easter.(3) Invited the. Lord President of the Council to obtain theviews of the Chiefs of Staff on the proposals forrelaxation of the restrictions regarding road signs andthe immobilisation of vehicles, and to submit a report on-. these questions to the War Cabinet.Parliament.SelectCommittee onNationalExpenditure.(Previous.Reference: .W.M. (42) 86thConclusions,Minute 7.)A&quot;11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (43) 160) regarding the extentto which, the Select Committee on National Expenditure and itsSub-Committees were pursuing enquiries beyond their terms ofreference. Attention was also drawn to certain undesirablefeatures in the procedure adopted by the Sub-Committees in pursuing their enquiries. ;&apos;-The Lord Presidents Committee had considered the position,and recommended that the Chairman of the Select Committee should now be informed that in future the Committee and its Sub-Committees should confine their activities to matters falling within their terms of reference, and in particular should not seek to dealWith issues of an operational or policy character or to obtain figuresregarding programmes and output of war materials. TheChairman should also be informed that the Committee should, infuture, obtain the specific authorisation of the Minister concernedbefore calling upon officials, members of the services, or Govern-ment contractors and their employees to give evidence or tocommunicate documents in regard to Government business.In discussion it was suggested that the Select Committee oughtat least to be free to call as a witness the Accounting Officer of a department without obtaining the prior authority of the Minister.The War Cabinet^-(1) Endorsed the recommendations of the Lord presidents committee, as set out in W.P. (43) 160, subject to furtherconsideration of the point mentioned at   A &quot; above.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council and thethe Chancellor of the Exchequer to see the Chairman of. the Select Committee and to speak to him, on their behalf, on the lines indicated in W.P. (43) 160, and thereafter to submit a furjther report to the WarCabinet.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,AprilW, 1943;       ;
