The War Cabinefs Conclusions were as follows :-r(1) The Minister of Production^ scheme for allocation oflabour to the building industry, set out in W.P. (43) 196,was approved, subject to modification on the lines indicated by the Minister of Labour and NationalService at &quot;X.&quot;(2) The Lord President of the Council was asked to arrangefor a very early meeting of his Committee, and of theService Ministers, at which consideration should be givento the suggestion outlined at the Meeting whereby allbuilding labour would be treated as a single pool and power would be given to a single Minister to arrange,after consultation with the other Ministers concerned,for the labour force to be concentrated in due successionupon the completion of the building jobs of the greatesturgency.(3) The Minister of Works was invited to submit to the lord presidents Committee a Memorandum showing hOw he contemplated that a scheme on these lines would work.(4) Pending consideration of this proposal, a decision wasdeferred as to how the additional requirements for building labour, outlined at the Meeting, should be met.2. At their Meeting on the 19th May, the War Cabinet had invited the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of works to arrange for technical experts, in association with representativesof the Air Ministry, to review the programmes of ,aerodromeconstruction With a view to seeing that further economies in man-power and materials, and what increase in speed of construction,could be secured by accepting lower constructional standards aridby other technical devices.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Works (W.P. (43) 220) reporting that the standards towhich the Air Ministry were now building were as economical as was generally practicable.The Minister reported, however, that the Air Ministry had not accepted the same standard of austerity as the War Office in thesleeping of other ranks. The War Office allowance was now 18 mento a Nissen hut, against which the Air Ministry allowance wasonly 15.It was explained in discussion that the War Office and admiralty had deliberately lowered their standard. The medicalauthorities advised that this lowering of the standard involved someincreased risk of disease, but the War Office experience was that,given due precautions, this had not proved a serious matter.The War Cabinet-Decided that the Air Ministry should conform to thestandard which had been adopted by the other two services in this matter.The Minister of Works also reported that in a number of caseslabour did&quot; not become redundant on Air Ministry works as quickly as might have been expected. This was apparently due to the carrying out of small works and extensions after the completionof the main contract.The War Cabinet-Decided that this matter should be dealt with as part ofthe investigation which would be undertaken by the Lord^Presidents Committee into the system of controlling&apos;building labour (see Minute 1).Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1, -Zrd June, 1943.
MOST secret no circulation.M;(45) 80th CONCLUSIONSThursday,, 3rd June. 1943iLARIES THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he, theI JUNIOR Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor had had a meeting;NISTpSRS with the Junior Ministers, at which he had explained therecommendations in the Report which he had read to the WarCabinet on the 18th May.      Thirty Junior Ministers had &quot;been present.      There had been a sharp division of opinion and,on a vote &quot;being taken 15 Junior Ministers had voted against.    proceeding with the scheme outlined in the Report, while14 had been in favour of proceeding with it.      One JuniorMinister had not voted.      Sxibsequent to the meeting he had seen Commander Charles Williams (Deputy Chairman of theCommittee) who had thought that it would be undesirable that the scheme should go forward.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he thought the difference of opinion which had manifested itselfamong the Junior Ministers was likely to be reflected inthe House generally, if the scheme was proceeded with.      Onthe whole, therefore, he thought that the balance ofadvantage was against taking action on the lines recommended in the Report of the Ministerial Committee over which hehad presided.Discussion showed that this was the general view,of the War Cabinet, more particularly when account was taken of the fact that the benefit to be derived from the proposed concession tc.-Junior Ministers amounted only to  50 net perannum.     -The War Cabinet considered whether a decision shouldbe deferred until the Prime Minister*s return.     In viewof the progress being- made with the Finance Bill, it was felt that a final decision could not be delayed and thatthe right course was to decide not to proceed with&quot; theproposal put forward by the Ministerial Committee preside over by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W.1.
