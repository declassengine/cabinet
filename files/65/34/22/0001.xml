Thanksgiving might be appointed&quot; / somewhat further ahead by means of a message from. - *  . The King calling upon the people to offer thanks for the victory.. Whilst such an arrangement would give timefor the organisation of special services and ceremoniesappropriate to the occasion, it would lack the element of spontaneity which would be preserved if the thanks-giving took place on the first Sunday after the news of^. the victory.* In discussion, it was suggested that United Nations Day, onthe 14th June, might be made the occasion for a special celebrationof the victory in Africa. The feeling of the War Cabinet was,however, that it would be the general wish of the people to offer. J thanks for the victory on the first Simday after the news had reached this country; and that in all the circumstances the balance, ofr, i advantage lay on the side of adopting course (a) above.At the same time; it was thought appropriate that there shouldbe a National Service of Thanksgiving at St. Paul&apos;s Cathedralduring the following week, possibly on Wednesday, the 19th May.It was hoped that His Majesty The King might be able to attendthis Service.The War Cabinet were informed that steps had been taken toobtain the views of the leaders of the churches, and it was learned that they would be agreeable to arrangements on the lines indicated at (a) above.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) A public announcement should be made forthwith to theeffect that at church services qn Sunday, the 16th May,special prayers of thanksgiving would be offered for the victory in Africa; and that, wherever practicable,church bells should be pealed before the mid-morhingservice. It should also be stated in the announcement that a National Service of Thanksgiving would be heldat a place and time to be announced later; and that itwas hoped that the public wOuld join in the demonstra-tions which would be held on the following Sunday in&apos; . &apos;.. celebration of the work of the Home Guard. ;^ (2) It should be made known at the same time that a Motion&quot; of thanks for the Victory would be passed by. both houses of Parliament on the next Sitting Day,^ (3) The draft of this Motion of Thanks shouldbe submitted forconsideration by the War Cabinet on Monday, the17th May. &apos;   -      . &quot; &apos;    ..
