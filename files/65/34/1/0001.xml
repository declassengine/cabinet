$*H?V-   , 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theCpQstraoUon First Lord of the Admiralty on the New Construction Programme/Pep^mme.      1943 (WP. (43) 122).(Previous . -Discussion;&apos; centred-mainly: round the following points: - lReference: ,W.M.(42)i47th Aircraft-Carriers. &apos; &apos; &apos;Conclusions, It was proposed to- lay down 4&apos; Fleet aircraft t-Carriers,t expenr&apos;..Minute 2.)    &apos; diture on which would extend into 1948.;The question;.&quot;was raised whether in present circumstances itwas desirable to devote so much of our resources to vessels whichwould not be completed for so-long.    -It was pointed out that ho Battleships or Cruisers were included in the present programme, and that Casualties must beexpected among our Aircraft-Carriers. Moreover, it was essentialthat We should have Carriers which could accommodate larger andheavier aircraft of better performance.       !\\. Destroyers.The question was raised whether it was desirable to include inthe Programme as many as .26 Fleet Destroyers of the 1942 or Battledesign and 17 of the Intermediate design. Ships of the formerdesign would not be completed for two years from, ordering, while those of the Intermediate.Class took about two months less.The Prime Minister deprecated the tendency to make more andmore improvements in the design of Destroyers, which added totheir size. As the Destroyers became- bigger they became more vulnerable. These Battle&quot; Class Destroyers were almost-as big asthe small Cruisers of the last war, but, of course, they lacked&apos; protective armour. He would have liked/to have seen more of our. resources devoted to building vessels which could be completed more quickly.In reply, the First lord of the Admiralty and First Sea Lordexplained that these Destroyers were required not for Fleetprotection, but to form part of the Battle Fleet. The endurance,speed and armament required of such a Destroyer could not be incorporated in a vessel of less than about 2,300 tons. TheAdmiralty wouldhave liked all the Destroyers included in the 1943programme to have been of the Battle type, but there were not enough slips available to lay down vessels of this size, arid they had therefore had to include 17 Destroyers of the Intermediate type.We had suffered heavy losses: in Destroyers, and had far fewer- Destroyers in service than we required. Furthermore, we had lostmany Destroyers through air attack, and it was essential to includeanti-aircraft guns with powered mountings.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it was hoped toreduce to some extent the building time of both types so that from-the time of laying down to completion they would take from 16 to18 months. . -, -... : . &apos; &quot;The question was raised whether some reduction could be madein the number of Destroyers included in the Programme, additionalFrigates or Corvettes being substituted for them.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that Destroyers were mainly built by firms who specialised in this type of construction,and he thought that the substitution of Frigates for Destroyersmight impede the flow production and prove uneconomical. Thepoint could be investigated further.&apos; The War Cabinet- ; &apos;,(1) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to consider and/xepbrt whether additional Frigates &apos;.and. Corvettes couldbe substituted for some of the Destroyers included inthe &apos;New-.C6h8tractiori Programme, 1943.(2) Subject to (1), approved the New Construction programme set out in the First Lord of the Admiralty&apos;s Memo-.    raridum (W.P. (43) 122).      .

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (43) 128) recommending, that four destroyers of the Royal Navy should be transferred as:a giftto the Royal Canadian Navy for employment on escort duty in the atlantic; It was hoped that the Canadian Government would agreeto allocate for work, with the Fleet on this side of the Atlantic fourTribal Class destroyers building; or completed for them in thiscountry. .The view of the War Cabinet was that, having regard to canada&apos;s outstanding contribution towards the war effort of theEmpire, it was most appropriate that these ships should betransferred as a gift. -It was possible that the Canadian Government might ask forthe transfer of a further two destroyers later in the year. Theterms on which these might be transferred would fee considered atthe time of the request; but the War Cabinet would be disposed toagree that these vessels should also be transferred as a gift if that were found convenient to the Admiralty.-The War Cabinet-   -Decided that the four destroyers mentioned in paragraph 2of W.P. (43) 128 should be transferred to the Royal- Canadian Navy as a gift.Ceylon.constitutional reform.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 166thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. In December 1942 the War Cabinet had approved the termsof a statement to be communicated to the Board of Ministers andthe Minority Members in Ceylon regarding the intentions of HisMajesty&apos;s Government as to the form of .Ceylon&apos;s Constitution afterthe war.In the Memorandum now before the War Cabinet (W.P. (43)129) the Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out that this statement had not had the effect expected, and submitted for thegeneral approval of the War. Cabinet the draft of a further state-ment (set out in.Appendix II of his Memorandum) on lines suggested by the Governor and Commander-in-Chief. this statement amounted in effect to a promise of &quot;full responsibilityfor government under the Crown in all matters of internal civil administration.&quot; The only matters to- be reserved would beexternal relations and defence.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, in advisingthat the earlier statement would satisfy the Board of Ministers, theGovernor and Commander-in-Chief had misjudged the situation.They now took the view that, unless a less guarded statement could now be made, there would be a. serious deterioration in the Island&apos;swar effort. The, Secretary of State said that, after weighing all.the relevant considerations, he had come to the conclusion that thebalance of advantage lay on the side of making, a further declarationoh the lines suggested.In discussion, it was pointed out that this new declaration would provide no lasting safeguards for the interests of minorities,and on this point it might afford a dangerous precedent in further discussions of constitutional reform in India. It also seemed desirable that, if such, a declaration were to be made, somethingshould be said at the: same time about the possibility of a commercial agreement toprotect Indian and british commercial interests, in the island. .      *&quot;&apos;
