International 1. --Atv^ew^fMeetuig&apos; on the 8th April,11943, the War CabinetRegulation of : had asked that the Committee app6ihted* to consider the schemeprimary for a Commercial Union should also consider the plan for theFroiiuots.       international  Regulation  of   Primary  Products   outlined  in(Previous ,      W.P. (43)97.Reference: &apos; The War Cabinet now had before, them a Memorandum by theVJ&apos;M. (43) 50th Chancellor of the Exchequer (W,P. (43) 185) reporting the views of conclusions,the Committee.Minute 2;) The Committee were, in general, satisfied that some form ofinternational regulation was necessary in order to avoid the violentprice fluctuations which had been a feature of the inter-war period,and believed that the plan outlined in W.P. (43) 97 was, broadly speaking, the best that could be devised for this purpose. It was- recommended that, when the time came for the scheme to be com-municated to the United States Administration, it should be made. : clear that, in the. opinion of the United Kingdom Government, theproposals in regard to buffer stocks, described in paragraph 12 of w.P. (43) 97, represented the essence of the plan, and that, whilst the quota regulation of exports might be necessary for a limited number of commodities in certain special circumstances, it wasonly acceptable subject to the safeguards Outlined in that paragraph. A draft aide-memoire, to be handed to the UnitedStates State Department, was annexed to the Chancellor&apos;sMemorandum.(Previous As regards the timing and method of the approach to be made reference: to the United States Government, it was recommended that ourW.M. (43) 58th Delegation to the Pood Conference, in consultation with his conclusions, - Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and the Treasury Representative in minute 4.)      Washington, should be given discretion to communicate the plan tothe State Department at the moment which appeared to them to be most opportune.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was hoped thatit would not be necessary for our Delegation to the Food conference to communicate to the State Department the plan set out in w.Pv (43) 97, since it would be better that this matter should bediscussed separately from1 that Conference. It was, however,necessary to be prepared, in case a situation arose in which the plan had to be communicated informally to the State Department.- The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries asked that thisshould not be done until the representative of his Ministry had reached Washington.This was agreed to.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in the Chancellor of the exchequers Memorandum, as summarised above.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, tocommunicate with the United Kingdom Delegation tothe Food Conference accordingly.iril 1^43 the War Cabinet had decided that(Previous P^^^J^gS^-had. before them a Memorandum by the reference: The .waruapmet       , m    L Ministers and the Ministerw.M, (43) 55th Lord Prrvy Jeal, *%Ag&quot;gu^turai guidance as to theConclusions, in1 Parliament on theWM. (43;) 50th Conclusions, Minute 1.b 2
lat December, 1942, by the Minister without Portfolio&quot; with thexrol oi ilce lJ7ai Ccioi^ol ail s fey s/he coversnmi, to announce any progress would not only be received with deepdissatisfaction by Parliament^but would give rise to increasingsuspicions among the agricultural community as to the Govem-moui&apos;a inten&apos; iozio with&apos; regcrd to the future - of the industry. . TheMinisters therefore recommended that the Government spokesmenshpuld-fee empowered&apos;--^ ;.: :&apos;:-(a):.To&apos; make it clear that there&apos;had been no change in the weight which the Government attached to the importanceof the maintenance of a healthy and welhbalancedagricultural policy:after- the war as a permanent feature of national policy.- : &apos;(&amp;) To state that it had not proved possible at the present stage of the war for the War Cabinet to carry its considera-tion of the problems involved in the formulation of apermanent post-War agricultural policy to a point atwhich Ministers could usefully embark on detailed discussions with the industry, but that all aspects of sucha policy were at present under examination by theMinisters concerned, in the spirit of the undertaking given by the Government spokesmen under (a) above.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet &apos;- Approved the above formula, on the understanding thatit would be strictly adhered to by the government spokesmen, so as to ensure that no new commitments wereentered into. The Government spokesmen should also, intheir speeches, include a reference to the Governmentsstatements (made in the Debates on the Beveridge Reporton the 16th to 18th February, 1943, and also in the PrimeMinisters broadcast speech on the 21st March, 1943) tothe effect that post-War plans involving expenditure mustbe looked at in relation to each other and to the financial*  position when the time came to put them into effect.Home Defence. 3. At their Meeting on the 19th April the War Cabinet hadRoad signs and invited the Lord President of the Council to obtain the views of theimmobilisation Chiefs of Staff on certain proposals for relaxing the existingof vehicles. restrictions regarding road signs and the immobilisation of vehicles(Previous       and of boats on inland waterways.Reference: The War Cabinet were informed that these proposals had nowW.M. (43) 56th been considered by the Chiefs of Staff, who supported the proposedConclusions,    relaxation.Minute 10.)
