Coastal command had made one promising and five possible attacks oh U-boats. They; had also sunk a 6j,000-with tanker Off Norway and hit a large ship inthe Bay of Biscay. Fighter Command had carried but small butsuccessful operations in Occupied Territory. Enemy losses for theweek *our aircraft.In the Mediterraneanour aircraft had damaged 3 U-boats and,together with United States forces, had sunk 3 merchant ships,,probably sunk 5 and damaged 25 others.In Tunisia Allied air forces had attained a high degree ofsuperiority.. Enemy losses had been reported as 177 destroyed (38 onthe ground), 64 prooably destroyed and 85 damaged. Our losses hadbeen 59 destroyed and 25 damaged.Shipping losses, including belated reports for the previous,week, had been 78,000 tons.In the Bay of Biscay the A dventure had intercepted an inward-bound blockade-runner, which had scuttled herself. Anotherblockade-runner had been intercepted, but not sunk, off the North coast of Spain by a United States Submarine. The destroyerBeverley had been sunk while escorting an outward-bound Atlantic-convoy.According to a Press report one Italian 8-inch cruiser had been;sunk and another damaged-&quot;by -United States bombers.The operations of Allied forces in Tunisia were described.Kairouan had been reported clear of the enemy and it had been&apos;unofficially reported that Spusse was in our hands. The FirstArmy&apos;s offensive in the North was proceeding satisfactorily.A short discussion ensued about operations in Burma..Mr. Bruce said that he understood that the three Divisions of theAustralian Expeditionary Force: which had returned to Australiafrom the Middle East were being specially trained and re-equipped for jungle warfare. He thought that the experience gained by australian troops in New Guinea might be of value to the indian military authorities.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said.that action was;already in hand to profit by experience of the New Guinea fighting.He undertook to follow up a suggestion that a number of Australianofficers with experience of fighting in New Guinea should go to Delhito pass on their experience. .The War Cabinet^Took note of these statements.Busso-g*bllsu-Relations.(previous reference.:W.M.

HeWould like to send instructions toPur Ambassadprat Moscow to take this matter tip with the Kussiansy as pt&amp;erwise fie feared that thePoles might adopt some extreme course, such as withdrawing theirAmbassador from Moscow. &apos; ,;   The Prime Minister and said that hevery much-hoped1 that^the JJussian^ would now agree that the families of the Polish troops^ in the Middle East should be allowed
t::-&apos;sT:he:; Secretary of State for Foreign&apos; Affairs said;that he proposed that our Ambassador should make a strong point of this.The -WarCabinet-;Endorsed the suggestion of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs. ; ^3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a Member ofParliament had sought to put down a Question asking him whether he had obtained reports from junior officers as to the flying qualities of the Barracuda. The First Lord of &quot;the Admiralty said that hehad represented that this Question should be disallowed hy the Clerkat the Table. The Parliamentary Secretary to the/ Admiralty had,in fact, recently flown in this aircraft anl had met a number of pilotswho were all enthusiastic as to its flying qualities: vThe Prime Minister said that he thought it would be wrong toallow Questions to be put on matters of this kind. He hoped theWar Cabinet would support the First Lord of the Admiralty in theattitude which he had taken up.      .The War Cabinet-Approved the line of action proposed by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty.4. The Prime Minister said that the 14th May would be thethird anniversary of the formation of the Home Guard. Hethought that this should be celebrated by holding ceremonial paradesthroughout the country, accompanied by special arrangements for publicity. This would have a heartening effect on the morale, ofthe Home Guard; and, from the strategical point of view, therewould be advantage in demonstrating to the enemy that, even when we had sent substantial forces overseas, we could still rely for thedefence of this country on a strong and efficient body of volunteersin addition to the regular troops retained for home defence.The Secretary of State for War, while agreeing that thisanniversary should be marked by special publicity including, he hoped, a broadcast message from the Prime Minister, foresaw twodifficulties in arranging for special parades to be held on this day.First, the Home Guard authorities had recently been instructedto* reduce the number of parades held, in order to avoid placingundue strain on men whose primary duty was to maintain war production. Was it consistent with this to organise large-scaleparades on this anniversary ?Secondly, in the rural areas it would be difficult to arrange for large parades to take place without making undue demands on transport.He therefore suggested that it might suffice if Home Guardunits held Church Parades on Sunday, the 16th May.The view of the War Cabinet was that, in order not to interferewith production, parades should be held on Sunday, the 16th May,but that Church Parades would not demonstrate the fighting^strength of the Home Guard, and that on this account parades, at^whichweapons could be carried, should be held.7fThe Home Secretary and Minister of Home, Security undertook to-t ^ider:a suggestion&apos;that some of the Civil Defence Servicesmight &quot;lake1part in these parades. , &apos;The War Cabinet-Agreed that.arrangements should be made to celebrate thethird anniversary of the formation of the Home Guard ahdinvited the; Secretary of State for War to submit detailed proposals for the approval of the Prime Minister. Themain feature would be: the; hblding of armed paradesthroughout the Country on Sunday; the 16th May.   the parliament.Undesirable &apos;parliamentary questions.(Previous .Reference:W.M.

Prime Minister undertook to broadcast a message to theHome ; Guard; and the Minister- of iaformation was invited to arrange for other publicity measures in consulta-tion with the Secretary of State fcrWar.United NationsDay.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 68thConclusions,  ,Minute 4.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, by theMinister pf Information (W-vP. (43) 140) stating that it was likely that President &quot;Roosevelt would invite us to celebrate the 14th Juneas &quot; United Nations Day.&quot;We had acceded to a similar request last year; if we did soagain, we might be committed to this as an annual arrangement for the future. Further, the date fell this year on Whit Monday;and it might be preferable to avoid increasing the demands on transport and catering to which the holiday would in any eventgive rise.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that,&apos;if thesuggestion were made by President Roosevelt, it would be ungraciousto reject it. It would not, however, be necessary to organise paradesor displays in all the larger towns throughout the country. It wouldbe sufficient if large parades, including contingents of the armed forces of all the United Nations, were held in London, edinburgh and Cardiff. Suitable publicity would, of course, be given to thoseparades.The War Cabinet-Agreed that, in anticipation of the expected request from president Roosevelt, the Minister of Information shouldmake provisional arrangements for parades, in London,Edinburgh and Cardiff; in celebration of United NationsDay on the 14th June.Church Bells;(previous reference:W.M. (43) 48thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The War Cabinet were informed that the Archbishop of canterbury had asked whether the church bells might be rung onEaster Day and Whit Sunday.The Secretary of State for War raised no objection to thelifting of the existing restriction in respect of these two days.In, discussion it was suggested that the restriction on theringing of church bells might now be entirely removed. Could notsome alternative signal be devised for giving warning of airborneattacks? The Prime Minister said that he would like to considerthe issues involved.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the restriction on the ringing of church bellsshould be waived so as to permit the bells to be rung onthe morning of Easter Day and Whit Sunday, and invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security to issue the necessary instructions.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,April 12, 1943.
