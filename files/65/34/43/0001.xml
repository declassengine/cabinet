(41) 64thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. ; The Prime Minister said that his attention had been drawn to a statement in the Daily Herald of the 24th June to the effectthat we were prepared to make a bargain not to bomb Rome if itwere made an open city. -This was stated to be based on something which had been said &quot; off the record &quot; by a Service Officer at one ofthe meetings held with the Press. The Prime Minister said that he did not criticise the Officer concerned, but he thought that thearrangements should be reviewed, and that steps should be taken toensure that some ministerial control was exercised. over suchinterviews. The instance he quoted was not the only one which had come to his notice.The Minister of Information said that, in accordance with aWar Cabinet decision, the Service Departments controlled theirown publicity. These &quot; off the record &quot; meetings between the press and responsible service officers were of great value, and the Pressappreciated the guidance given at them.&quot; In this particular instancethe Daily Herald had published a statement, made by an officer whohad had great experience and success in dealing with this sort ofwork, which&apos; had not been intended for publication.

We had enteredinto certain obligations after the Vichy regime in Syria hadcapitulated, and we could hot afford to. see s these obligationsdisregardedIn discussion, it was pointed out that we had: not yet formallyrecognised the Committee of National Liberation. The question was raised whether it was desirable that we should now do so;&apos; Inthis connection attention was drawn to a statement in the eveningpapers of that day, which appeared to issue from&quot; an Americansource, which had a strongly anti-de Gaullist tone.. The general view of the War Cabinet was that it was very desirable that we should take action which would build up theauthority of the Civilian members of the Committee of national liberation, but that, bearing in mind the American attitude, it.would prdbably be undesirable to accbrd, formal recognition at thisstage. .        y&apos;: x   -.    ,        -  :The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whenthe full facts as to the Mokaddam case had been ascertained from Syria, to take the matter up withM. Massigli (the member of the French Committee ofNational Liberation who dealt with foreign affairs). Themanner of handling this matter should be such as tosuggest that questions affecting our relations with Frenchterritories would naturally fall to be taken lip with theCommittee of, National Liberation at Algiers; but formal recognition should not be accorded at this stage.trench North 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, referred to theJLMoa...: views which he had expressed to the United States Ambassador asProposed to the reply which might be given to the request that M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatOzeoho- Dr..Benes was shortly proceeding to Russia and wished to concludeSlovakia..        a Treaty between Russia and Czecho-Slovakia, on the general lines. of the Anglos-Russian Treaty.  The,Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, had told him that he thought this course would be undesirable, in view of the present relations between Russia and* , Poland.  As, however, Dr. BeneS was rather persistent, he.wouldlike to tell him that the War cabinet endorsed this view.There wasthe further consideration that a year ago, when there*     -,: had been some question .-,pf - a: ;.(&amp;viet-YttgoMav, Treaty, he (theSecretaryof State for -Foreign Affairs) had come to an agreement^ with M. Molotov that both we and Russia would refrain from&apos;       r    concluding treaties with smaller Btates. covering the post-war period. He would like, therefore, not only to.tell Dr. BeneS that, inour view, it would be undesirable that a Czech-Russian treaty should be concluded at this moment, but also to inform M.
