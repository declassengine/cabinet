Conference of Representatives of British Commonwealth and Empire. (Previous Reference W.M. (42) 109th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

1. The Prime Minister referred to the prospect of international discussions during the coming months on a variety of problems and sait that, for this and other reasons, it would be helpful if there could be a Conference at an early, date of Primes Ministers or other Ministers representing the Governments of the British Commonwealth and Empire.

The view of the War Cabinet was that the time was ripe for holding such a Conference, and that there would be substantial advantages if this could be held some time in the coming summmer, possibly in June or July. Every effort should be made to persuade the Ministers of Dominion Governments to come to London for such a Conference. It was recognised that some of the Dominion Prime Ministers might find it impracticable to travel to this country at the present time, but it might be possible for these to send a special representative qualified to speak on their behalf.

Preliminary enquiries of Dominion Government should be made at once.

The War Cabinet-

Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to communicate at once with Dominion Governments, in the light of the discussion, to ascertain whether it would be practicable to arrange for such a Conference to be held during the course of the coming summer.

The Secretary of State for India should be kept in touch with the course of these enquiries so that, at an appropriate stage, a similar enquiry could be addressed to the Government of India.



Town and Country Planning (Interim Development) Bill.



2. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda on this subject by the Minister of Town and Country Planning (W.P.(43) 111), the Home Secretary (W.P. (43) 117), and the Lord President of the Council (W.P. (43) 132).

The objects of the Bill were-

(a) To extend planning control throughout England and 

(b) To strengthen control over interim development while planning schemes were being prepared.

The Legislation Committee* had approved the terms of the Bill, subject to decision by higher authority on the questions:

(i) Was it expedient to proceed with planning legislation by stages, beginning with his limited measures, or would it be preferable to wait until comprehensive legislation could be introduced making radical changes in the system of planning?

(ii) If legislation was to be introduced amending the Town and Country Planning Acts, should not this opportunity be taken to confine the planning functions of Local Authorities to the Councils of Countries and County Boroughs?

These issues had been discussed by the Lord President&apos;s Committee on the 25th March. The majority of Ministers had taken the view that the balance of advantage lay on the side of proceeding with the Bill, but had referred the matter for final decision by the War Cabinet.

In discussion in the War Cabinet, the following were the main arguments advanced in favour of proceeding with legislation on the lines of the draft Bill:-

(a) Control over interim development needed to be strengthened at once, in order to prevent the position from being further prejudiced.

* H.P.C (48), 8th Meeting, Minute 5.


(b) The. terms of the Bill had been negotiated with, the associations representing the Local Authorities, whoaccepted it. If it were decided to propose, at this stagechanges in; the existing distribution of planning functions among Local i Authorities, it would benecessary to reopen those negotiations,V and there-was bound to be opposition from some ofthe Associations ofLocal Authorities; \(c) It was clear that a proposal to! remove planning duties^rpinDistrict Councils Would meet: witn; strohg oppositibn,and it was undesirable to complicate the presentmeasureby stirring up this-controversy;5&apos; more especially since it was hot certain that the right solution was to entrust planning functions to the Councils of counties and County Boroughs.The main points urged against proceeding with the proposed bill were as follows :-(d) It was some time since the Scott and Uthwatt Reports hadbeen received, and the Government would be criticisedif they Were now to go forward with a limited measure which might, give the impression that the government intended that planning functions would continue to beexercised by the Local Authorities to which they were atpresent entrusted. &quot;.(e) The number of Local Authorities exercising planningpowers was far too large..(/) There was a strong case on merits for planning powersbeing entrusted to larger authorities. The smallerauthorities were actuated by the motive of stimulating the maximum development within their; own&apos; areas inorder to attract an increase in rateable value, irrespective-tive of whether this was in the national interest.(g) The proposal in the draft Bill giving the Minister power-to deal with interim development applications was criticised on the ground that Joint Authorities wereineffective instruments of administration. (To this itwas replied that the Joint Authorities had operatedmore successfully in the country at large than inLondon.)In further discussion, it was suggested that, if planning functions were to be left with the smaller Local Authorities, it was essential that the Minister should have adequate powers to ensurethat any which were recaloitrant or obstructive could be compelledto take more than a purely local point of view and to do what wasnecessary in the national interest.In reply, it was pointed out that, whereas hitherto the CentralGovernment had exercised only negative and regulative powers, aMinistry of Town and Country Planning had now been set up, towhich, for the first time, would be assigned a positive vole as a central planning authority. Furthermore, the new Minister wouldhave Regional Planning Officers who would be in touch with the planning authorities up and down the country, and in this way hewould be able to influence the lines on which planning was carriedout, and to encourage a wider outlook on these problems./.. The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hethought the balance of advantage lay in proceeding with theproposed Bill, The Minister would, of course; make it clear thatthe Bill was a preliminary Bill, to be followed at a later stage bya larger Bill. Further; since no building could take place until after the war, what was immediately required was a measure tovprevent rights being acquired which would prejudice the future,and would strengthen control over interim development whileplanning schemes were being prepared. In particular, it shouldbe made clear that the introduction of this legislation did not
prejudice m any f ^ the question of the authorities to whomplanning funcfcipns should he entrusted guilder a more far-reachingscheme for the reform of Town and Country Planning.Authorised the Minister of Town and Country planning to introduce the Bill, it: being understood that he would include in. his.- speech,. ,on-. the&apos;: Second Reading of the&apos;Bill,a statement ph the lines indicated by the primeMinister.Offices of the War Cabinet, SlW.i,April 6, 1943.       1
