llosso-PpilBH The War cabinet had before them the text of the announcementRelations. issued by the Polish Government. The original draft had been(Previous modified by the Polish Government on lines suggested to them byBef erence: the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WtM. (43) 59th The War Cabinet also had before them the text of a PersonalConclusions, Most Secret Telegram from the Prime Minister to M. Stalin, datedMinute 1.) &apos; the 28th April.The Secretary of State for Foreign, Affairs gave the WarCabinet an account of the interview which he had had with theSoviet Ambassador that morning. The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had read to the Ambassador the Prime Minister&apos;personal message to M. Stalin. The Ambassador had made it clearthat he did not like the Polish Governments announcement, inparticular the statement that the Polish Government still adhered to the frontiers of 1939. M. Maisky said that the Polish Govern-ment had let it be known that we endorsed their announcement.Did this mean that we also endorsed the Polish claim to their1939 frontiers, which figured in the announcement ? The Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs had said that, while we had advised the Polish Government as to the form which their announcement should take, our position as to the Polish frontiers remained what it had been at the time of the Soviet-Polish treaty.M. Maisky had then referred to a complaint which theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had made to him on theprevious night about the Soviet War News, and had said that hein his turn had a complaint to make about certain articles in thePolish Press. He had also referred to an order of the day byGeneral Anders, and had asked the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to obtain copies of these documents and read them. TheSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had then drawn attention^to an article by Mme. Vassilievska in 1zvestiya the previous day,violently attacking General Sikorski, and had pressed that thesepress polemics should, cease-Hfchis&apos;being the first condition for therestoration of normal relations. &apos; The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that he had spoken on this matter to the Polish foreign secretary, who had undertaken to exercise restraint.Reference had also been made at this interview to a chargemade in the Russian press that the action of the Poles in withdraw.-ing their troops from Russia to Persia showed reluctance to fight.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had said that our experience had been that the Polish airmen and seamen were extremely gallant. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had also made it clear that we intended to stand by General Sikorski,. and that we should regard as extremely serious any intention ofthe Russian Government to set up an alternative Polish Govern-ment. M. Maisky had said that he thought that any such course was unlikely to be taken, and he added that, whatever might happenabout Poland, he hoped that this would hot affect relationships between Great Britain and Russia in other directions.The discussion which ensued showed that the War cabinet was in full agreement with the line taken in the Prime Minister&apos;personal telegram to M. Stalin and by the. Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in his interview with M. Maisky. It was agreedthat the essential first step was to stop newspaper publicity on thismatter. In particular, action should be taken to prevent journalspublished in this country by foreign Governments resident inLondon from issuing articles which conflicted with the general interests of the United Nations.The view was also expressed that, while the attitude whichwe had so far adopted in this matter had been appropriate, it mightbe necessary, if the Russian Government continued to be obdurate,that we should take a somewhat stiffer attitude.As regards the frontier question, some apprehension was expressed that&apos; the Russian Government might be attempting to exploit the situation so as to ensure a settlement of the Russo-Polish frontier oh lines acceptable to them.   It was suggested in
discussion that we should make it clear that we would not agreeto these territorial questions being settled until the end of the war.The general view of the War Cabinet was, however, that it mightbe necessary to reach a settlement on this question before the endof the war.Poland&apos;s The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that PoLandVNational National Day was being, celebrated on Sunday and that the LordDay. President of the Council had undertaken to make a speech at the celebration. He assumed that the arrangements made should stand.The War Cabinet endorsed this view.&apos; The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and endorsed the action taken.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tocommunicate to the Dominion Prime Ministers, for their personal information only, the text of the PrimeMinisters telegrams to M. Stalin.* *Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,April 29, 1943.

General Stillman,General Ghennault and 3ttg*.&amp;en*3 8gelti&amp;e&amp;e ^ng$0ithe5UnitedStates, and it would be awkward if we refused to allow ourCommanders-in-Chief in the Par East to go to America and,later, things went wrong.   The Prime Minister said thathe therefore thought our Commanders-in-Chief ought to go,but they ought to go with political support.   He had therefore reached the conclusion that he ought to go, andwould take with him the Chiefs of Staff.   He woulrt also take/with him the Minister of War Transport, and would discuss, besides Operation ANAKIM and our strategy in the far East, the question of Operation HUSKY and what should follow it.   He asked the Cabinet&apos;s permission to make thenecessary arrangements.

But whan thePrime Minister made it clear that he was sure that he ought to go, the War Cabinet&apos;s assent was given.&quot;ices of the War Cabinet,4th May, 1943.
