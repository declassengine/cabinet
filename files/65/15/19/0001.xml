It would be best at the present stagenot to discuss these operations, but the War cabinet ought to be under no illusion as to the extent ofthe assistance that we could give.     We were severelylimited by the size of our forces in the middle eastern theatre.In view of the risk of invasion at home, itwas remarkable that we had been able to reinforce theMiddle East by some 72,000 troops.     Another 53,000troops ought to reach the Middle East by the end of1940.     From the beginning of 1941 onwards, he would &apos;like to see a further division despatched each month to the Middle East.     The provision of escorts and shipping presented formidable difficulties  in the achievement of this programme.     The whole question&apos;was being thoroughly examined.The reinforcement of our forces in theMiddle East had also to be balanced with the.strengthof the forces which must be retained in this country-The War Cabinet took note ofthis statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
