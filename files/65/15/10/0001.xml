Conf jjaejytlal Annex.(25th September, 1940 - 11.30 a.m.). THE PRIME MINISTER summarised the situationwhich had developed at Dakar in the light of varioustelegrams.The previous evening a telegram had beenreceived showing that, in spite of a close-rangebombardment, the forts had not been reduced,, the fireof the French warships had not been neutralised andthe morale of the garrison remained high.   Fog hadinterfered considerably with operations (telegram1417N/2.4^&quot;x A Meeting had been held the previous evening? with the Service Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff toconsider the position, and a telegram had been sent tothe Commanders asking for a full account of thesituation, and suggesting that a landing might beeffected at Rufisque under cover of night or fog(telegram 0005/25)?*A further telegram had since been receivedfrom the Commanders reporting that a, landing was impracticable in face of existing defences and that theonly alternatives were either an immediate withdrawalor a continuation of systematic bombardment (telegram1936/09-)?*A reply had now been received (which was readout to the War Cabinet by the First Sea Lord) to the telegram despatched the previous evening giving thesituation in greater detail.   A landing by Frenchfuselier mar ins had been carried out at Rufisque, butthe troops had subsequently been withdrawn.    H.M. S.CUMBERLAND had suffered damage from the guns of the fortress, our air reconnaissance had been hampered by-A.A, fire and fighters, French resistance remained    vunimpaired and morale seemed to be high.    In conclusion the Commanders had stated their intention to continuethe bombardment that morning, and if it proved ,effective to carry out a landing should th$,s be in anyway possible.Since this telegram bad been received information had come through that H.M, S. RESOLUTIONhad been, hit (after the bmftpirdment had beearesumed)and was wi-ondra^wing;     The situation was,therefore, obscure a-nd unsatisfactory.

itThe Prime Minister said that there were twocourse open to the Cabinet.   The first was to refrain from,interfering with the orders of the Commanders on the spotand allow them to go forward with their present proposals to effect a landing if this should prove possible.    Hewould have advised this course before receipt of the news that the RESOLUTION had been put out of action;   butthe withdrawal of this ship added to the risk of theoperations.    The alternative course was to give ordersfor the operation to be brought to an end.There was no doubt that the arrival of theFrench cruisers had changed the whole complexion ofthe situation,    Thay had almost certainly brought to Dakardetermined officers, who had been put pn shore to stiffenthe forces there.     The landing of a force at this juncture would be a serious step for it might conceivably be cut off.    Further, to keep our ships outside Dakarwould be to expose them to the risk of attack from U-boats.There was   also a report from Tangier that a number ofGerman and Italian aircraft were flying south west, andthey might be on their way to Dakar (telegram 402 fromTangier).     Once it had been decided to put a force onshore, we might be involved in operations of an indefinite length.     Further the fact that our ships were engaged at Dakar would mean delay to the reinforcement of the Mediterranean, and the ARK ROYAL would be unableto return to this country to pick up her new aircraft.A continuance of the &quot;Menace&quot; operation would undoubtedlycommit   us    to a great effort and great risks.On the other hand, if it was decided to abandon theoperation it was useless for General de Gaulle to proceed t*5Bathurst where we could not protect his force.    Inthat event, he should be instructed to go toDuala where we could provide a force to safeguard him including,perhaps,the RESOLUTION.     We should also reinforce Freetown bydetaching from the &quot;Menace&quot; force one or two battalions of Marines,The abandonment of this operation would undoubtedly mean that we should suffer a serious rebuff andwould give a setback to the deterioration which was taking place in the Vichy Government !s position.    Thepublic would also want to know why      had allowed theFrench cruisers to pass Gibraltar.    Tlq.e answer to thiswas that it had not been our policy to . stop them proceeding as far as Casablanca.    If it was asked &quot;why we had notintercepted them at Casablanca the answer was that theyhad eluded us.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the &quot;Menace&quot;operation had been a justifiable gamble on the state of^morale at Dakar.     But the morale of th^ Vichy forces at dakar had been unexpectedly stiff and made a successful operation most doubtful.   He considered the attempt to putGeneral de Gaulle ashore with British, troops at Rufisq.uaa difficult operation which had littlevChance of success,,unless there was a sudden collapse of Wie morale of theFrench forces at Dakar of which there was no evidence.   Hewas in favour of o ailing the operation oTf and cuttxng our losses.,

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed with the Lord Privy Seal.       We had, perhaps,accepted too readily the rosy estimate of theoperation which had been given by General de Gaulle&apos;ssupporters, and we had been misled  by people onthe spot as to the feeling of the French forces at dakar.     The only method of turning failure intosuccess was by engaging in a major operation and wehad too many commitments elsewhere to adopt that course.It might result in a dangerous dispersal of effort of which the end could not be   seen.     Whilst thiswas his conclusion, he ought to add that theEgyptian Ambassador held the view that failure to push through this operation would have unfortunate results.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO agreed withthe view of the Lord Privy Seal and the foreign secretary, and considered that the abandonment of theoperation would be bound to have serious reper-cussions;   but these would be even more formidableif the operation was proceeded with and still ended in failure.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that although he had been against the operation from thebeginning  yet having embarked upon it he would have advised its continued prosecution had not theRESOLUTION! been put out of the fight.       The withdrawalof RESOLUTION had changed the situation and, subject toany further information arriving in the meantime, heacquiesced in the view that the operation should be abandoned.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR and THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES agreed with theview of the Lord Privy Seal.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought itwas essential to give the Commanderson the spot an indication of how we viewed the position, moreespecially since they might otherwise misinterpretthe last sentence in the telegram despatched theprevious night.       The Prime Minister thereuponwithdrew to draft a telegram.The Prime Minister later returned to theWar Cabinet with the draft of a telegram to the commanders of the forces.     This draft was approved,subject to one or two amendments.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that a statement would have to be issued, setting out the reasons why the Expedition had been planned, and the sequence of events which had led to the three French cruisers and three Contre-torpilleurs passing through the

Straits     of Gibraltar and reaching Dakar.       Thestatement should explain that the only action&apos; whichwe had taken had.been to test the forts;    that,whereas we had been led to believe that Dakar was anxious to declare for General de Gaulle, we had met with stubborn resistance;    and should indicate thereasons why we had decided not to proceed with thefurther use of force.The War Cabinet:-(l) Agreed to the despatch of the telegram attached to thisAnneau(2) Invited the Minister ofInformation, in consultationwith the First Lord of theAdmiralty, to prepare a draft statement on the lines suggested,for consideration later by thePrime Minister and other ministers concerned.Richmond Terrace, S.-W..1.

SECRET.To:    S.O. Force M.    114. 25/9/40.From: Admiralty.MOST IMMEDIATE.To M.A. from Prime Minister.Part I.On all the information now before us, includingdamage to RESOLUTION, we have decided that the enterpriseagainst Dakar should be abandoned, the obvious evilconsequences being faced.     Unless something has happenedwhich we do not know which makes you wish to attemptlanding in force, you should forthwith break off.     you should inform us most immediate whether you concur, but,unless the position has entirely changed in our favour,you should not actually begin landing till you receiveour reply.1327/25.SECRET.To:    S.O. Force M.      115. 25/9/40.From: Admiralty.MOST IMMEDIATE.To M.A. From Prime Minister.Part II.Assuming enterprise abandoned, we shallendeavour to cover Duala by Naval Force, but we cannotsafeguard de Gaulle&apos;s forces at Bathurst.     Question ofreinforcing Freetown with troops is being considered.Instructions regarding disposal of remainder of forces will be giteren on receipt of your reply.1328/25.

SECRET.Prom S.O. Force M. 24.9.40.Addressed Admiralty, S.O. Force H, F.O.C. Worth Atlantic.IMMEDIATE.72 From M.A.Bombarded again this afternoon in similarvisibility without apparent useful result from this or air bombardment carried out earlier.--Reduction of defences and neutralisation ofFrench battleship RICHELIEU and French cruisers present an impossible project for available forces in prevailingvisibility and a most difficult operation for any forcein any weather while morale of defences remains as high as at present.     Air action against our fleet is increasing.Am now proceeding to consult de Gaulle.1417N/24.SECRET.To S.O. Force &quot;M&quot;. 25.9.40.From:    Prime Minister to Combined Command.MOST IMMEDIATE.AJDAC.Your signal 1417N/24 gives no indication of yourplans.     We asked you particularly to be full and clear inyour accounts.     Why have you not sent two or three hundred words to let us know your difficulties? and howyou propose to meet them?2.     We do not understand conditions under whichbombardment proceeded for some hours at 10,000 yardswithout grave damage to ships or fort unless visibilitywas so bad as to make targets invisible.     Also ifvisibility bad, why is it not possible to force a landing at beaches near Rufisque in spite of fire fromGoree Island.3.     Without&apos;this fuller information we can only askwhy you do hot land in force by night or in the fog or both on beaches near R^eifisque and take Rufisque for a startobserving that enemy cannot be heart-whole and force atRufisque is comprised largely of native troops.     At thesame time if the weather clears you-&apos; could hold down

batteries on Goree Island in daylight by long-rangesea-fire and if there is fog you would not need to do so.It should be possible to feed the force, once ashore, by night.      This force once landed ought to be able to advance on Dakar.4.       More ammunition is being sent from Gibraltar butevidently supplies will not stand many days firing likeyesterday.     Neither is there unlimited time as not onlythe French but German submarines will probably arrive insix or seven days.5.       Pray act as you think best, but meanwhile givereasoned answer to these points.     Matter must be pushedto conclusion without undue delay.0005/25.SECRET.Prom S.O. Force M. 25.9.40.Addressed Admiralty., F.0. Force H, F.O.C.N.A.MOST IMMEDIATE.From MiA.My 1936.In continuation of my 1417/24.     We have come tothe conclusion that any landing operation in face ofexisting defence is not at present practicable and that only alternatives that can reasonably be considered are -(1) Immediate withdrawal.(2)Continuation of 1 systematic bombardment to such extent as weather conditions and forces availablepermit in the hope that resistance may collapse:    inour view a very unlikely contingency.While the situation has now been fully discussed with De Gaulle who expressed his surprise at the magnitude and completeness of the resistance embracing allforces he spontaneously expressed the following wishes.That we should immediately inform Dakar that itwas his express wish that bombardment, continuation ofwhich would serve no useful.purpose to his cause, should now cease.      Instead British Naval Forces should continueto assure that French Naval Forces would be unable to operate against West African ports south of Dakar.He emphasises that immediate dispersal of Force M.would indicate a reverse and prejudice his cause.     he suggests a blockade but it was pointed out to him thatthis was not feasible.

For himself and his force he proposes he should proceed to Bathurst where;-(l) He can exercise his troops after long confinement.(2) He can then gauge public opinion in Senegal which appears now so unfavourable to further land operation.(3) He can have time to consider his further plans.We are of the opinion that his proposals pggg tsigood means of discontinuing an operation which on present/holds little prospect of military success commensurate with the&quot;probable damage to Naval Forces.     Providedvisibility-improves sufficiently we intend to make afurther effort to neutralise ships and fort tomorrow.Should inadequate result be obtained we recommendadoption of De Gaulle&apos;s proposals.1936/24.SECRET.From General Spears. 24.9.40.To the War Office.MOST IMMEDIATE.S.46 cipher 24.9.40.General Ismay from General Spears.     Followingfor Prime Minister.1.       General de Gaulle agrees with commander (?s it)would be unwise to attempt landing now in facingunexpectedly determined opposition.2.       Nature of opposition unexpected and seems due totremendous efforts by Vichy.3.       Fusiliers Marins were landed in late afternoonat Rufisque yesterday in face of opposition.     There were some casualties.      It would have been possible to carryout landing in force but men had to be re-embarked owingto presence of two cruisers in fog staying off.     Frenchtransports were being shadowed from air and if discoveredby cruisers could have been instantly destroyed.     A signal(8 groups undecipherable) Charier abandoned.End of part one.     Part two follows.

Part two.4.       General de Gaulle suggested as good temporary-face saving and that Dakar should he informed bombardmentshould cease at his request.     He thinks however it wouldbe a great (?mistake) to simply sail away maintainingonly commercial blockade.      (?He) thinks movement of shipsimportance southwards should be prevented.5.       De Gaulle wants to go to Bathurst with his force (a)) to exercise men who have not been ashore since?England) (b) obtain information on real conditions ofhome service Senegal.6.       It is essential to suggest that de Gaulle&apos;semissaries were fired at majority wounded, that his troopsfired at and shelled at point blank range although theyhad not fired a shot.     That same applies to British whoalso suffered loss before returning fire.End of part two and final.MOST IMMEDIATE. Reed.  25.9.40.Addressed to C.  in C. , repeated to G.Q.0. west african Cols, and S. of S. for the Cols. No. 272.Following from Brunei to General de Gaulle begins.Arrived safely from Dakar after having cut all telegraphicand telephonic communications of Dakar with the help ofspecialists.A late message from Boisson and G.O.C. Dakarasked for speedy help of French troops of the Sudan toprotect Dakar.      The troops of Dakar and Thies have only about two months training.      It is very (group ommited)(? necessary that) railway line from Bamako to Kaolack be cut.      I have plenty of information having stayed inFoundiougne, Kaolack, Thies, Rufisque, Dakar, Mbour,Tivouan, Fatick.I ask for plane to leave Bathurst to convey meto you.When I last heard from Boislambert he was in Dakarwith an administrator on 23rd September ends.Brunei Hacoun and Richard arrived at Bathurst.
