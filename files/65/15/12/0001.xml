Annex-(1st October, 1940 - 11,30 a.m.)FRANCE.policy towardsthe vichy government.PreviousgRef erence:Mi, (40) 239thConclusions,Uinute 6,.)The War Cabinet had before them thefollowing papers dealing with our policy towards the vichy Government:-(a) Memorandum by.the Foreign Secretary(W,P.(40) 392 )0(b) Memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty (W.P,(40) 396),(c) Memorandum by the Foreign secretary covering a Report from the Foreign(Allied) Resistance Committee dealingwith Economic Pressure on FrenchV/est Africa (W,P, (40) 395),(d) Memorandum by the Vice Chief, of the naval staff on Free French action in St. Pierreand Miquelon (W.P.(40) 389),THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said our main purpose (as stated in paragraph 8 of w.P. (40) 392) must be to secure that the french colonial Empire should be healthily anti-German and anti-Italian and be got to act accordingly^   provided this was achieved it was not vital whether the french colonies were under Vichy or under de Gaulle.    TheCabinet should be clear about our broad policy towardsVichy, otherwise doubts and difficulties were bound to arise continuously on such questions as what we should do at St. Pierre and how we should apply the   blockade,.Before Dakar there had been a considerable weightof testimony that French opinion in Government circlesand unoccupied France generally was swinging our way.This feeling had received a setback with Dakar.    Partof our purpose was to encourage this feeling withoutprejudice to our main object.    There was a danger thatif we did not play our cards wisely we might find ourselves drifting into something like hostilities withthe Vichy Government, the consequences of which were set out in the Admiralty paper. The line of country that we had to ride was tricky;    and whilst none of uswished to start eating out of the hand of an uncertainVichy, yet there was a considerable case for informingVichy of what we wanted, iyhat we would stand and what we-would not stand.     He would like to explore thepossibility of, coming to the modus Vivendi which m.-Baudouin had asked for&apos; some three woeics ago, but to which]we had made no response.

The Foreign Secretary then referred to thereport from Cairo in that day!s &quot;Times&quot; stating thatthe five Italian Generals whom Mussolini had sent tonegotiate the surrender of -Syria had been recalled indisgrace&apos; as nearly all their demands had been met by either .evasion or by a blank refusal, .   The foreign secretary also referred to telegram No,  252 from Madridiwhich stated that the French Ambassador in Madrid had called on Sir Samuel Hoare with a message txcm the FrenchMiaister? for Foreign Affairs-     23?.e French Ambassador had said that he had not come v?ith any m&amp;csags so forcible asthat. Slivered the previous night by the French Naval Attache&quot;to the British Naval Attache&quot; at Madrid, but t&amp;at he waschiefly interested in eradicating anti-British feeling that was again bursting out in France and in making it possible for France and Britain to continue onthe same road towards ultimate victory,.    Mo Baudouin&apos;message had been to the effect that if the FrenchGovernment was not to be driven entirely in&quot;&amp;2) german hands, Great Britain must allow supplies to pass from french Colonies to non-occupied France0      If this was allowed, the French Government would   be prepared toaccept any&apos;necessary supervision and would guaranteethey would not be seized by the Germans.     Should theGermans attempt to seize them, the French Government wouldbe transferred to Morocco and France would be once againunited with us against Germany.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY interpolatedthat the message from the French Naval Attache had madefour points(l)   The attack on Dakar had violated theundertaking given in July that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would not attack the French Fleet in any French orColonial port.(2) We had preferred to attack the french navy in lieu of attacking Germany.(5) Our policy seemed to be to promoterevolution in France and her colonies0This could only bring both Empires to ruin.(4) The attack on Dakar had been answered bya bombardment of Gibraltar.    The french would continue to answer every nevtattack in the same way, and they could make the Mediterranean untenableunless we engaged -(a) to suspend all attack:(b) to renounce propaganda for civil war:(c) not to Impede ships bringingfood supplies.

THE.SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,continuing, said if the War Cabinet considered, thatit was worth while to see if we could reach a modus vivendi   with the Vichy Government, the Departmentsconcerned might be asked to examine the question and suggest to the Cabinet the bones of an agreement which, if approved, might be put to the vichy government.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we should not allow a particular incident to influence our judgement unduly.     Dakar had been unfortunate, andhad chilled and repressed a movement favourable to us,but that incident would not prevent the tides ofopinion asserting themselves.     The mere fact thatM. Baudouin had made the approach mentioned in SirSamuel Hoare&apos;s telegram, showed that the consequences of Dakar had not been so serious.     Strong forces were on our side, if we continued to survive in the battlefor Britain.       Again, we had recognised general de Gaulle and had entered into solemn engagements with him. De Gaulle had not behaved   badly at or after Dakar, and had fallen in with our plans;his people were not discouraged and he was now proceeding to Duala with a view to seeing what hecould do in French Equatorial Africa where it was essential for us to have a favourable french administration.       We should protect him there, and assist in any movement he started.The Prime Minister said that he did not differ from the Foreign Secretary on the principle oftalks with the Vichy Government, which should be encouraged, but only in the emphasis to be laid on them.     He did not consider this a golden opportunityto come to an understanding.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed that our judgment must not be deflected by aparticular incident.    He agreed also that we shouldassist de Gaulle in Equatorial Africa.      But hethought that we might find it easier to get the FrenchColohiesto adopt the attitude we wanted with, rather thanwithout,the assent of the Vichy Government.     he therefore favoured initiating talks,    although theywould have to proceed very cautiously on theeconomic side.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he thought we were assuming too much if we assumed that &quot;the .Vichy Government.had a will.of its own, or thatGermany would allow them to do anything which was opposed to German plans.As, regards the Naval situation, it would nowappear that our position in the Western Mediterraneanwas dependent on the goodwill of Vichy.     What wouldbe the situation if Germany told Vichy to challengeour blockade?

THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE agreed.that it was impossible to prevent ships passing fromAlgiers to Marseilles.    .But he did not agree that theblockade of unoccupied France and North Africa, taken as a single unit, was ineffactive, although there might be some small leakages through Spain.       the atlantic blockade was very effective indeed, and he believed that very little, if any, shipping passedfrom Casablanca to Bordeaux.    He would like anopportunity to make counter suggestions to those contained in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Paper.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies said that he would not have thought that the rigidcontinuance of the West African blockade was incompatible with the Foreign secretary proposals, and suggestedthat it was possible, for the time being, for thetwo policies, namely, continuance of the blockade and discussions with the &quot;Vichy Government,to proceedtogether.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatit had not been possible since Dakar to maintain arigid blockade of West Africa as the necessary naval,forces were not available.     At the same time our blockade in the Mediterranean was having its effect&quot;,as witness the serious food position in the Dodecaneseand the restricted rationing which had been imposed onMetropolitan Italy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it would benecessary for the War Cabinet to decide:-First, whether, if General de Gaulle wanted to make an expedition to some French colonial territory which had not yet declared for him, e.g. Libreville,he should be allowed to do so.Secondly, whether French ships should be stopped proceeding from West Africa to MetropolitanFrance.In regard to the second point, a discussionensued as to the present disposition of the naval forces which had been assembled for Operation &quot;MENACE&quot;.The view was expressed that the Admiralty should take steps to reconstitute a strong Naval force at gibraltar as soon as possible.The question arose whether the BARHAMwhich was proceeding to Gibraltar for repairs, shouldContinue to form part of the Naval force stationed at gibraltar, or should be passed through to the eastern mediterranean.     THE FIRST SEA LORD said that certainrepairs had to be done to the MALAYA.     This matter was reserved for discussion by the Prime Minister withthe First Lord of the Admiralty.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that the message which M. Baudouin had sent to us through the French Ambassador at Madridshould he answered ; on the f following lines:-(l)   We were always.ready to have discussions with representatives of the vichy government:&apos; &apos;.(2)   We were bound by our undertakings toGeneral de Gaulle:(3)   Our main concern was to see that theFrench Colonial Empire, and particularly the ports in French colonial territory,did not fall under German domination:(4)    If the Vichy Government could give ussatisfaction on these three points, weshould be prepared to consider whether we could allow some trade between french colonial territories and unoccupied France.THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE thoughtthat point (4) should be put very tentatively.For his part, he would prefer to say,  in more general terms, that we were prepared to discuss these matters.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR asked whetherthe effect of a message on the lines suggested by theForeign Secretary would not be to sterilise general de Gaulle in the territories in French equaltorial africa which might already have declared for him.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, unlessterritories were very ready to declare for general de Gaulle of their own free will, we should have great difficulty in persuading them to do so.    In his view it would be wrong to assume that the parties inFrance which were opposed to General de Gaulle werenecessarily pro-German.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thoughtthat the troubles and perplexities of France mightwell lead to developments in our favour.    How could we refuse to back up General de Gaulle if he wishedto make an attempt to gain over Libreville?THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIESsaw nothing inconsistent in opening conversations with the Vichy Government and maintaining the pressure by continuing full support for General de.Gaulle...THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the replyto the message given to us by the French ambassador at Madrid should certainly include the following;

(previous reference: &quot;X&quot;W.M.(40) 224thConclusions,Minute 2.)First, that while we made no complaint of -the,action already taken by them againstGibraltar, which Was in retaliation for.the Dakarepisode, we wished the Vichy Government to know that, if they bombed Gibraltar again, we shouldretaliate by attacking Casablanca and sinking the-ships there.-- -Secondly,  as regards Mediterraneantraffic, we should make the point that ships were already passing from Algiers to Marseilles.Thirdly, as regards the French request that merchant - ships proceeding to unoccupied france should be allowed to pass through theStraits of Gibraltar, we should say that we werenot satisfied that merchandise arriving inunoccupied France would not reach Germany,    Theywould, no doubt, reply that they could give guarantees on this point, and an argument might follow.As regards French merchant vesselspassing through the Straits of Gibraltar, thepresent policy was that if these vessels wereescorted they should not be interfered  with,but if unescorted they should be sub j ect to normal contraband control measures, (it was alsocur declared policy to prevent French warshipsproceeding to parts in enemy controlled France).The Prime Minister thought that these orders should stand for the moment, but the WarCabinet must realise that unless these orders were altered, or We reached an arrangement withthe Vichy Government, the result would be to relax our economic pressure on Dakar.The War Cabinet:-(l) Invited the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to draft atelegram to our Ambassador atMadrid in the light of thediscussion in the War Cabinet, andto submit it to the Meeting of theWar Cabinet to be held on the. following day:(2) Agreed that in the meantime no alteration   should be made inthe existing Admiralty orders inregard to French merchant vesselsproceeding through the Straits of gibraltar.    (See &quot;X&apos;.)(3) Took note that General de Gaullewas proceeding to Duala, and thatthe War Cabinet would be consulted before he undertookany further operation.

SI(4)   Agreed that, for the present, no action should &quot;be taken in regard to the proposed!expedition to St. Pierre and Miquelon.(5)    Invited the.Admiralty to take steps toreconstitute an adequate Fleet at gibraltar,Richmond Terrace, S.W, 1,
