The ships&apos; aircraft had now made contact witha French cruiser and another ship - believed to be thePRIMAGUET&quot;with a tanker in company - on a line betweenFreetown and Duala.     Of the West African ports PointeNoire and Duala had declared for General de Gaulle butLibreville still supported the Vichy Government.The First Sea Lord assumed that the ordersalready given held, and that these French ships shouldbe prevented from putting into West African ports.The War Cabinet agreed with t-bJs view, thePrime Minister adding that the PRIMAGUET was the vesselon which disaffection had been reported.^ No doubt an.endeavour would be made to get the ship to come over toGeneral de Gaulle rs forces6THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the RENOWN and six destroyers were west of Gibraltar patrolling offCasablanca.    He asked what action should be taken todeal with French ships which passed through the Straits,THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the right course was that the ships should be interrogated andai ked where they were going.    If they were only goingto Casablanca, they should be allowed to proceed, butwe should endeavour to prevent them from proceeding&quot;beyond that point,(Previous ^Hhis had been the conclusion reached by the reference; War Cabinet on the 11th September,?W. 1.(40) 247th * -Conclusions.Minute &amp; )

.....00^6/18 SeptemberSECRET .:   MESSAGE in from S. 0. Force M. Date   18. 9. *!-0.Received   0756.___;___Ilaval Cypher (D) by W/T. _IAddressed   Admiralty.   Repeated   C. in C, South Atlantic .MOST IMMEDIATE26. From MA.&apos; Your 2352/16.At meeting today De Gaulle (? insisted) upon necessityfor early action at Dakar. (? one) possible alternative approachthrough Jaolacj but we consider this impracticable with shipping available. He considers any considerable effect upon local moraof arrival of cruisers unlikely, but states, impossible to verify-this within reasonable time.He is advised that substantial support for him is   ...likely to be found in Dakar if agents are sent to foster it,action is not unduly deferred and too British a complexion of thoperation avoided.   His agents are ready at Bathurst and have their instructions.De Gaulle now proposes original plan to enter harbourunopposed should go forward but that if this fails free french troops should attempt landing at Rufisque:supported by navaland air action if necessary and thence advance on. Dakar;(British ?) troops only to be landed in support if called uponafter bridgehead had been established.; ..This would circumvent opposition by French warships inthe harbour but owing to boat situation in available troop shipsmust be relatively unopposed on the beaches to offer prospects of success. &apos;Our view is that scuttling1 of POITIERS may possibly.&apos;,indicate stiffening of anti-British attitude, but French seamen&apos;are notoriously anti-British and French troops and civilians notnecessarily affected.This arrangement may also indicate suspicion of our intentions resulting&apos; in reinforcement of p-arrison from Theis as-well as by crews of cruisers but voice of troops at Theis isknown to be pro De Gaulle.   A newly discovered favourable facto.;is that coast defence guns are manned by colonial troops and netby Naval ratings.After careful consideration of all factors we are ofthe opinion that the presence of these three cruisers has not sufficiently increased the risks, which were always accepted,to justify the abandonment of the enterprise.   We accordingly recommend acceptance of De Gaulle&apos;s new proposal and that,v/should.....o.
should he fail,    Landing of British troops should be undertaken to instal him as previously contemplated.   The increased strength in Naval Forces mentioned in Flag Officer Force M&apos;s 1642/16 is however considered essential.The operation could be carried out four days afterdecision of H.M. Government is received. -;Message Ends1st1st2nd3rd4th5thLord,S.L.S oL.Sit&amp; cL.S cL *V.C.N.S..A.C.N.S.A.C.N.S.A.C .N.S.C.S.0. to. 1st S.L.D.O.D.(H).D^OeD. (]D.D.O.D.
