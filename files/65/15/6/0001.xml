(40)  252nd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Oonfidential Annex-(17th September, 1940, 9.0 p.m.)The following telegrams were handed round to the War Cabinet, and collectedon the conclusion of the Meeting:-Telegram to the Prime Minister fromGeneral de Gaulle, dated 17th September,pressing strongly that the operation forthe reconstitution of French West Africa,involving direct action upon Dakar by sea, should be carried out as originallyplanned.      Should the British Governmentmaintain its negative decision, general de Gaulle requested the co-operation ofthe British Naval and Air Forces presentwith him in an alternative plan for operating against Dakar from the interior,proceeding from Kholack via ThiesoTelegram from Major-General Spears to thePrime Minister, :Iated 17th September (intwo parts) supporting General de Gaulle&apos;srepresentations, and arguing that, if general de Gaulle should fall in with theDuala plan, his power to influence eitherWest Africa or any other part of the French Empire would be gone for ever.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that looking at the matter from the naval point of view,we did not want war declared against us bythe Vichy Government.     Further,the proposed operation via Thies involved a navalblockade of Dakar, for which we did not possess adequate forces.     The First sea lord said that the argument which hadweighed with the War Cabinet, when it had decided to cancel Operation &quot;Menace&quot;, &quot; -3.,(he assumed) the general improvement    &quot;-.the morale of the Vichy forces which was likely to have resultarrival of the cruisers from ,vvfighting strength of the cruist. was not great..kt-corn the19    The&quot;:Yi ;w:: lvesTHE PRIME MINISTER agreed that theaccretion of strength resulting from the arrival of six medium-sized warships, wasnot great;    but their arrival might strengthen the determination of the pro-Vichy Forces inDakar.     In particular, the coastalbatteries at Dakar might now be resolutelymanned.      From our own point of view, the

new factor in the situation was that AdmiralCunningham and General Irwin, after the closestudy, of; the plans for Operation &quot;Menace&quot; foi?which the -voyage had given them the opportunity,were anxious: to proceed with the direct- operation against Dakar.   &apos; It must be assumed that they considered themselves to be in a position todeal with the coastal batteries.     Were theWar Cabinet prepared to say to them &quot;If you, the commanders on the spot, are anxious, aftar due consideration, to proceed with the original plan,we will back you.&quot;? -THE SERVICE MINISTERS gave the War Cabinetdetails of the forces taking part in the DakarExpedition..     Our Naval forces included theBARHAM,    the    RESOLUTION     the   ARK ROYAL   andthree 8&quot; cruisers.     The \Land forces in the convoyamounted to some 6,000 men, including royal marines and French Foreign Legionaries.The pJ?o-Vichy forces in Dakar were anuncertain quantity.     The coastal batteries were very strong on paper..     The reference in thefirst part of Major-General Spears&apos; telegram tothe French cruisers &quot;lying helpless in harbourunder awnings&quot; probably merely meant that they &quot;would not be ready to sail for perhaps two hours.     It was clear, therefore, that they didnot apprehend an immediate attack.It was unlikely that the RICHELIEU would turn her guns against us.     They had. never yetbeen fired, arid the vessel was in an incompletestate.THE. FIRST LORD OF&apos; THE ADMIRALTY saidthat it was unfortunate that we:had no reliableagents who could tell us about how the morale of the Vichy forces in Dakar.     Nor did we know whether the cruisers from Toulon had arrived at Dakar with a definite mission.

,       -It had occurred to him as possible thatsome of the larger German vessels now proceedingwestwards down the English Channel might conceivably be under orders to take part in some Africanadventure.THE PRIME MINISTER invited attention to thepolitical aspects of the problem.     Although we didnot desire, a state of war with the Vichy Government,the War Cabinet had so far been prepared to takestrong action against that Government&apos;s warships.They had lived to bless the day on which they had decided upon the &quot;Oran&quot; Operation, and they had beenprepared to force their way by arms into Dakar,should peaceful persuasion fail. Similarly, only.a fewdays previously, they had been prepared for our ships to sink the six warships whicn had sailed from Toulonrather than allow them to enter Dakar.     It was clear, th^efore, that the War Cabinet did not ratehighly tht dangers of any hostile reactions from Vichy.SIR ALEXANDER CADOGAN thought it conceivable that the reactions of- the Vichy authorities to thedestruction of their vessels in Dakar Harbour mightbe more serious than their reactions to the destructionof their vessels on the high seas, in the courseof a naval engagement.LORD LLOYD said that, in his judgment, Frenchopinion had developed considerably during the last fivaor six weeks.     Previously there had always been a danger that both Free Frenchmen and the adherents ofthe Vichy Government would take almost identicalviews of any action which might be construed asa British affront to France.     Today there was amuch clearer line of demarcation between the two groups of Frenchmen.     It did not now follow that all french opinion would be alienated by an attack on the vichy Government*s warships.THE FIRST LORD OF THE. ADMIRALTY said that our naval Attache in, Madrid had reported a very interestingconversation with the French Naval -Attache, wi*o had recently been in France,, and had received orders from&quot;Admiral Darlan to keep in touch privately with him(the British naval attache).     According to this reportthe French spirit remained unquenched,     and Frenchmengenerally wejee much less anti-British than they hadbeen.     There was a feeling abroad in France that itwould be- possible -for1 them, later on, once more tomake common cause with this country.     Paris was practically a city of the dead.     France wassuffering from an. acute shortage of fuel.     The  .Germans had done a great deal to exasperate Frenchopinion against them. . The French did not resent theI^jAi^^V^jattatp^cs on aerodromes in France.THE PRIME1 MINISTER thought that insufficientattention had been pai&amp; to. the moral effects of a failure of operation **Mehatte*&apos;*     if our expeditioncame back with its^ tall-between its legs we could hardly hope that the fact would escape notice, -

Some discussion followed as to the prospects of the alternative operation for which General de gaulle had asked our support, in the event of its &quot;beingde bided   that direct action should not be taken againstDakar, by sea,     This was an entirely new propositionwhich the Chiefs of Staff hr   not yet had anopportunity of examining.     ;j rima facie, however, it did not seem very promising.&apos;    It was thought that it-might be very difficult to get our shipping intoKholack.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR thought thatGeneral de Gaulle had no political future, if he didnot carry out an operation more or less on the linesof &quot;Menace&quot;,,     In all probability the military risks involved in direct action upon Dakar by sea were greater than General de Gaulle had appreciated,,nevertheless he (the Secretary of State) thought thatthe- right course was bold action against Dakar.It was significant that so able and cool acommander as General Irwin should be in favour of proceeding with the operation,,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR agreed.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO assumed thatthe War Cabinet need&apos; not take a final decision thatnighto     On the whole his own view was in favour of going forward with operation &quot;Menace&quot;.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that itwas a question of balancing the risks.     In his.judgment the risk of not going on with the operation was greater than the risk of carding it through.If the operation was abandoned, it seemed to him that nothing could prevent the. disintegration of the free french Forces in West Africa.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that his provisionalview was that we ought to proceed&quot;*with the operation.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that hewas anxious to obtain a direct expression of opinionfrom Admiral Cunningham, before a final decision wastaken..    He proposed to telegraph to Admiral Cumaingharithat night asking urgently for his views.     Hewould say that the point on which the War Cabinet feltdoubt was the morale of the Dakar garrison,     Was it likely to have been improved by the arrival of the..French cruisers?     Would the fire of the coastalbatteries be more effective as a result?The War Cabinet:-(l) Deferred ;-j;al?il the following day c*.final decision regarding operation&quot;Mer.ace&quot;.(2)     Recorded the provisional view that the answer to be returned to the telegramsreceived should be on the following lines:-

That the, reason,   why. the War Cabine4&quot; had decided against proceeding with Operation&quot;Menace&quot;was,   not that they thought that   .   ...the arrival, of 3 cruisers and.3 centre-torpil-leurs would add greatly to the power of resistance of the pro-Vichy Forces in Dakar -hut. that  their arrival mighthave greatly raised the morale of those forces that if the Commanders on the spot -Admiral Cunningham, General Irwin, general de Gaulle - who were in the best position to judge the situation were,   after full consideration, in favour of proceeding withoperation &quot;Menace&quot; in its original form(or in its original form subject to minor modifications), they were authorised by theWar Cabinet to go ahead- If they decidedto go ahead, whatever the result, theycould count on the full support of theWar Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.

This isparticularly essential on account of reactions from Vichywhich threaten to undermine the present favourable attitnadeof great majority in Africa.     It is also of vitalimportance from point of view of morale of Frenchpopulation of Africa who will inevitably get to know of arrival at Freetown both of myself and o12 british forces.     It is of even greater importance from point ofview of general conduct of war which demands in my opinion,that allies should gain control, before enemy do so, ofair naval and military bases of French Africa particularlyin North Africa,     At the very least, should BritishGovernment uphold its new and negative decision concerningdirect action Upon Dakar by sea,-I request immediateco-operation of British navalVsnd air forces here present tosupport and cover an operation which I personally shallconduct with my own troops against Dakar from interiorproceeding from Khslack via Thies.- C,4.
