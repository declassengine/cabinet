(40)  265th CONCLUSIONS. MTNTFPK .g.Confidential Annex.(3rd October, 1940, 11.30 a.m.)63PRANCE.Policytowardsthe vichy government.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 264thConclusions,Minute 6.)THE FIRST SEA LORD said that he did not knowwhether the QUERCY, with 250 French Marines on board,had succeeded in reaching Cayenne from Martinique.The Chiefs of Staff,  had considered the interception of this vessel, and had thought that it might be better not to molest her.   For one thing, molestation might result in the Vichy Government retaliating by furtherbombing attacks on Gibraltar.   Further, the Chiefs ofStaff thought that the chances of Martinique comingover to General de Gaulle would be increased if anypro-Vichy forces left it.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if this policy wasto be followed, the Vichy Government would be free totake such action o.s the/   liked against the french colonies which had declared for General de Gaulle.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat,when the War Cabinet had discussed this mattertwo days earlier, he had understood them to take theview that, provided the French Colonial Empire couldbe made anti-German, it did not much matter whether aparticular colony owed allegiance to General de Gaulleor to the Vichy Government.   He thought that Cayennewas of little importance as compared with reaching an understanding with Vichy.   He hoped that.we mighthave an understanding with them that if french colonies were prepared to declare spontaneously forGeneral de Gaulle5 the Vichy Government must not interfere with them.   In the same way, we should not interfere with Colonies which favoured the Vichyregime.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not thinkthat incidents would prejudice our relations with the vichy Government.   The fact that the Vichy Governmenthad made a demarche after Dakar went to show this .The conditions were such that the normal rules of conduct did not apply to our relations with France atthe present time.   While there was a lot to be said for not sending an expedition to, say, Reunion orMiquelon at the present time, it was quite another matter for the French to send a ship from Martiniqueto Cayenne^ which had shown its willingness to declarefor General de Gaulle.   At the moment, until our naval force had been re-constituted at the Western end ofthe Mediterranean, we could not interfere with.Frenchconvoys. :coming from the African coast under escort.While he did not ask for a decision in that sense that morning,he thought that the time would shortly come when we should have to take this course..

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL expressed general agreementwith the Prime Minister&apos;s view.   He had little faith in the Vichy Government as at present constituted,,which, he thought,, was in the grip   of the germans and had no will of^its own.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed with the PrimeMinister&apos;s view that incidents did not prevent thepossibility of some understanding with the vichy government.   Nevertheless,. he hoped that during thenext few days an endeavour Would be made to see whether an understanking could be reached with the vichy government on the lines suggested.   If the time camewhen we were in a position to interfere with Frenchmerchant ships passing through the Straits of Gibraltar,he thought that it would be advisable to tell the vichy government in advance that, if they tried to send shipsthrough the Straits under escort, we intended to stopthem..The War Cabinet took note of this discussion.   No further decision on policy was called for during the next two or three days, pending the re-constitution of our Naval forces atthe Western end of the Mediterranean.In the meantime it could be seen what -response was made to the telegram sentto our Ambassador at Madrid for commu-communication to the Vichy Government.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
