((^W.M. (kO) 278th. CONCLUSIONS., MINUTE 20Confidential Annex.(28th October, 191+0 - 5 p.m.)GREECE*   .AssistanceagainstItalianinvasion,(previous reference:&apos;//.M.(k1) 277thConclusions,Minute 2,)A preliminary discussion took place on thenew military situation in the Mediterranean created bythe Italian attack on Greece, and on possible methods by which this country might render assistance to greece.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had called aMeeting fbrtS&amp;t -evening, to consider the militarysituation in the Mediterranean.The following points were made in discussion:(l)   Greece had for some time been asking what assistance we could offer her in the eventof her being attacked.   Up to now we hadbeen extremely guarded in our replies, inview of the fact that any offer of militaryhelp to Greece would have mo ant the diversion of forces which were urgently requiredelsewhere and which were,, in many cases,already engaged in active operations againstGermany.(2)    Some weeks previously a proposal had beenunder discussion for detailing h squadrons ofWellingtons to attack Italy in  force^     Thescheme had been that, in addition to abase in Egypt, an advanced base should beprepared in Greece, from which these squadronscould take off to attack objectives in Italy*It had been decided, however, that theWellingtons were better employed in bombingtargets in Germany.   A scheme for theemployment of a bomber for-eo on these lines would now be re-examinedo(3)   A scheme had also been under examinationfor using Malta as a base for bombing raids on Italy.   Consideration of this scheme also had been postponed on the ground that,untilMalta&apos;s air defences had been strengthened,it was dangerous to attract undue attentionto the island.A further scheme was under examinationfor temporarily detaining in Malta a squadron of Wellingtons destined for the Middle East.While in Malta, the squadron might carry outraids against the seat of tho ItalianGovernment in Rome0   It was of coursemost important to avoid bombs falling onthe Vatican City0

(4) A suggestion was made that further air attacks should he carried out on Sicily.(5) Plans were being made for heavier air raids on Milan and Turin, to begin that night,if weather permitted.(6) It was now a primary task of the mediterranean fleet to prevent the landing of italian troops in Creteo     We were about to despatch a battalion which had been earmarked formaltality to Crete.     For the time being Malta would have to go without this reinforcement.(7) It seemed likely that the Italians intendedto occupy Corfu.      If they did, this wouldmake very little difference to us strategically.In any event, Corfu was near Italian air bases, and the area was heavily mined, and itv/as out of the question to send our Fleet tothat area.(8) Staff conversations had hot been held withthe Greek Government, owing to the risk ofleakage. But we had now been informed ofthe dispositions of the Greek Naval forces which comprised light vessels only.The War Cabinet:-(i) Took note that a Meeting was being held that evening, under theChairmanship of the Prime Minister,. to consider the military situationin the Mediterranean.(ii) Invited the Meeting, among othermatters, to consider what answer theForeign Secretary should send   tothe Greek Government in reply totheir request for help.(iii) Agreed that the general line to take with the Press, and in communications to the Dominion Governments, would bethat, notwithstanding the defectionof the French, we were doing all thatwas in our power to help the GreekGovernment.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,28th October, 1940.
