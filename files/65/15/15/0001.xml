It wouldbe useful if the Chiefs of Staff could examine thepossibilities of a German campaign developing,either this winter orin the spring, with the persian gulf or the Sues Canal as their objective.     Hingoingon this was the question whether we should make anyapproaches to the Turks.

In discussion it was pointed out thac thewinter was a good campaigning season in the Balkans,but the spring and autumn were unfavourable.     Theview was expressed that it was still more likely that Germany would attempt to advance to the middle east through Libya.     The British Naval Attache atBelgrade had reported an unconfirmed story to theeffect that two &quot;German Air Divisions&quot; were about toleave for Libya.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY also reported that theattitude of the King of Egypt gave some cause for anxiety.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was forconsideration whether we ought not to remind him that he was under the necessity of obeying our instructions.      It was illogical that Egypt shouldnot have declared war on Italy at a time when theItalians had invaded Egypt.       We had possibly beenremiss in allowing the fiction of Egyptian neutralityto continue.     These matters might be discussed bythe Secretary of State for War with Sir Miles Lampsonand General Wavell on his arrival in Egypt.The War Cabinet: --(l) Approved the proposal that theSecretary of State for War should pay a visit to Egypt, for thepurposes outlined in discussion.(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff toconsider the possibilities andimplications of an advance by theenemy through the Balkans and Syriato the Middle East;    and to reportto the War Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
