It waspossible that a French submarine was in company with her.      In this event, H.M.S. CORNWALL had been ordered to keep at high    speed while the PRIMAGUET was dealtwith by one of the D-Class Cruisers (the other hadbeen ordered back to Freetown).        If a Frenchsubmarine was present and attacked our ships, we should at once respond by using the necessary force.Later in the meeting a telegram was brought in to the First Sea Lord, to the effect that the threeFrench contre-torpilleurs had left Dakar and were proceeding towards Freetown,,      The orders previouslygiven to our ships had been that the French warships   -should be prevented from proceeding South of Dakar,for fear they should try to go to Duala and restore the production-Vichy Government..     These three contre-torpilleurswere probably engaged in reconnaissance, to ascertain the movement of our ships.The view provisionally suggested was thatwe ought to endeavour to intercept the ships at sea;but it was not easy for the AUSTRALIA to deal effectively with three fast contre-torpilleurs, whichmight well scatter if ordered by the AUSTRALIA toadopt a particular course of action.      It was also feltthat it would be undesirable to allow these three ships to return to Dakar.The War Cabinet:-Invited the First Lord and the first sea Lord to draft suitable instructionsto the AUSTRALIA, which was at presentshadowing the three contre-torpilleurs,and submit them to the Prime Ministerlater in the day.FRANCE.Hie French Fleet.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 253rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Richmond Terrace, S*-W. 1
