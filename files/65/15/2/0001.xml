(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT&quot; TTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.COPY NO.   16iMOST SECRETIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.W.M.  (40 )  244th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(Sth September, 1940 - 11.30 a.m.)aircraft production.Creation ofnew capacity in the UnitedStates.(previous reference:lW.Mo(40) 232ndConclusions,Minute 3.)The largerschemeprof eyr-fed.The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Aircraft Production (W.P. (40) 354),in which they were invited to choose between two alternative schemes for creating new aircraft capacity in the United States?(a) A scheme for capacity producing 3,000aircraft per month.(b) A scheme for capacity producing 1,250aircraft per month.The War Cabinet had also before them aMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(WoPo (40) 555), showing that there was no differencebetween the cost of the two schemes up to May, 1941.Unless special steps were taken, the initial cost tous in dollars of either scheme was likely to be the equivalent of  75 millions up to December, 1940, 37-g- millions in January, 1941, and  25 millions ineach immediately succeeding month.     This additional 75 millions up to December made it doubtful inn ether,on our own resources, we could last out the currentcalender year.Financial considerations apart, no doubt was felt but that the scheme for capacity producing3,000 aircraft per month ought to be proceeded with.The arguments which weighed with the War cabinet were as follows:-(1)    Our proposals might not be accepted bythe United States in the form in which we put them forward.   To provide ourselves witha margin   against possible cuts, it would be prudent to peg out the largest area on the&quot;ground floor&quot; of American aircraft production which we could reasonably claim0(2)   The figure of 3,000 aircraft per month tobe obtained from the United States was oneto which some publicity had already been given.(3)   The establishment of aircraft factories on alarge scale in the United States - to meet our requirements together with their own -would bring the Americans great economic advantage.   American finance also must beexpected to rally to this industrial expansion,once it had satisfied itself that the dangerof the United Kingdom being overwhelmed, andof the war being over in 1940, had passed away.No United States Government would dare to calla halt to this great expenditure, once it was,fairly on the way, and to assume responsibilityfor the ensuing economic slump.

pilots.Types of*craft.Strategy for1941.Finance.French goldheld in Canada.In discussion of the financial aspects ofthe proposal the following points were made:-(a) THE LIINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION saidthat he was willing for the scheme for,000 aircraft per month to be reviewed by the War Cabinet when the time camefor the first heavy payments to be made.The dollar situation obtaining at thattime would obviously be an important factor in the review.(b) Our dollar position would be considerablyrelieved if we could obtain possession ofthe French gold now held by the Bank ofCanada.    THE PRIME MINISTER said that theonly answer which he had received to his telegram to Mr.Mackenzie King had beenthat the matter had been referred to aCommittee.   He proposed in a few daysf timeto telegraph again to Mr. Mackenzie Kingpressing for an early decision.(c) There was a reasonable hope that theReconstruction Finance Corporation would put up the capital expenditure, if our programme could be co-ordinated with theAmerican, so as to ensure production ofcommon types of aircraft under a ;jointplan0    If this should be practicable,the United Kingdom share of the capital costs would be amortised and spread overthe contracts.:\\THE VICE chief OP THE AIR STAFF said that theAir Ministry were satisfied of their ability toprovide pilots to man the aircraft produced under thelarger of the alternative schemes.The War Cabinet discussed the extent towhich it would &quot;be expedient to insist on the americans providing us with British types of aircraft,especially &quot;Stirlings&quot;, &quot;Typhoons&quot; and &quot;Tornadoes&quot;^Although we were convinced that o\ir types were&quot;better, we might have to accept the &quot;best types thatthe Americans could &quot;be persuaded to offer.    It mightnot &quot;be consistent with the Reconstruction finance corporation bearing the capital expenditure   if british types  wei?e adopted.     The essential thingwas that we should be in possession next year oflarge numbers of heavy bombers.    The present battlewas largely a battle of fighters, but in 1941 itwould be necessary for us to carry the offensive farand wide into Germany.The flatter had also its political side.Assuming that the relative positions of this countryand Germany had not greatly changed by the coming winter, British public opinion would begin demandingto be told our policy for winning the war.    Ho one could actually foretell how any war was going to bewon;   but the best - perhaps the only immediate -answer to the question was that we meant to win the supremacy of the air, and to use it to bring Germanyto her knees.

(d) It was now fairly widely appreciated inthe United States that there was no prospect of our ever having dollars to repay the colossal sums for which wewere becoming indebted-to them,   Thepresent Administration had shown duringthe recent visit to America of sir frederick Phillips,  of the Treasury,&quot;     that they were well aware of our positionin this respect, although of course theyhad given no undertakings in regard to it.If however Mr, Wilkie should becomePresident., it might take a little time forhis Administration to size up thesituation., &quot;&apos;(e) We had no knowledge of what conditions the United States were likely to atta^.to the credits which we assumed theywere about to extend to us and we had,therefore, grounds for considerable financial anxiety.    We might well have to face another War Debts controversy.    Thefinancial danger, however, was far from being the most serious which we had to face.The War Cabinet -(a) Authorised the Minister of aircraft production to do his best to obtaincapacity in the United Statesproducing 3,000 aircraft per month,(b) Agreed that the scheme should be reviewed when the &apos; first heavy -dollar payments ibaocaae d&quot;j.e,-.(c) Invited the Minister of aircraft production and the Chancellor of theExchequer to keep the finance of thescheme under constant observation, andin particular to take all practicable steps to persuade the United StatesReconstruction Finance corporation to put up the capital expenditure,(d) Took note that every endeavour wouldbe made to persuade the UnitedStates authorities to adopt ourtypes but that this might not be consistent with the United StatesReconstruction Finance Corporationbearing the capital expenditure involved.
