MINUTE 8.Confidential Annex.(11th September, 1940 - 12.30 p.m.)THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the factthat the enemy was continuing to pass convoys of shipswestward down the French coast, although a small number of ships had been successfully attacked offOstend on the previous night.    A powerful armada was thusbeing deployed along the coasts of France opposite thiscountry. The argument of the naval authorities was thatif we were to send our ships to attack these concentrations)of barges and merchant vessels along the French coast,we might well throw away forces which would be invaluableto us if these barges and merchant ships attempted to cross the Channel.He had had a conference the previous nightto discuss our measures for defence against invasionv/ith the First Lord, the Secretary of State for Warand their advisers..Continuing, the Prime Minister said that the vital stretch of coastline was from the North Forelandto Dungeness.    If the enemy should succeed in gettinglodgements of troops ashore on this coast, and couldcapture the guns deployed there, they would have, notonly a bridgehead, but a sheltered passageway commandedby the coast defence guns from both sides of theChannel,,   Various steps were therefore proposed for strengthening this essential strip of coastline;-(l)   The gun positions should be intensivelyfortified.(2)   Consideration   was being given to employingmore highly trained troops in this sector^In particular, he hoped that the SpecialCompanies would be made over to theCommander-in-Chief, Home Forces, and someaf them employed in this sector.     behind the line for immediate counter attack wouldbe the Australian Division, armoured troops andthe London Division,(3) It was also under consideration to deploy30 to 40 Bofors guns in this area for thedefence of the troops against low-flying attack.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that since the conference on the previous night he had seen the Commander-ih-Chief, Home Forces, who pointed outthat the extension of German shipping down the Channelgave him a longer front to defend.     Nevertheless he agreed with the vital need for protecting the north foreland - Dungeness sector.     He was most gratefulthat the Special Companies were to he under his command.He would employ some of them in this sector,-but he did not propose to move the companies now at Ryde andRye.     The Commander-in-Chief was also very anxiousto get a regiment of Bofors guns.       He preferred tokeep the armoured troops and the New Zealand troops inthe Maidstone area, as this point was the best for internal communication to either Dover or Dungeness.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was proposing to visit this area on the following day in company with the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretaryof State for War and their advisers, and theCommander-in-Chief, Home Forces.The Prime Minister said that he understood thatthe First Lord of the Admiralty also agreed that theRODNEY should remain at Rosyth.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR raised thequestion whether the barges and merchant vesselspassing along the French coast could be attacked fromthe air.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF pointed out that inorder to carry out such an attack we should have to concentrate a large number of fighters to protect theattacking bomber force.     At the present time were quired to retain our fighters for defensive workover this country.Reference was also made to the possibility offurther mining measures outside the French ports.    TheFirst Lord of the Admiralty said that the admiralty had this matter under consideration.As regards the likelihood of invasion, THEFOREIGN SECRETARY referred to telegram No.  203 Savingfrom Madrid, in which Sir Samuel Hoare reported astatement from a German source that the real enemyobjective was Egypt.THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought it was by no means impossible that the Germans would in the enddecide not to launch an attack on this country becausethey were unable to obtain the domination over our fighter force.The War Cabinet took note ofthis discussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I. -

SWEDEN.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 222ndConclusions,Minute 9.)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, setting out an exchange of telegrams from His Majesty&apos;minister in Stockholm in regard to certain advances made by Dr. Weissauer, said to be a secret emissaryof Hitler, together with a draft reply to the lasttelegram from Stockholm.The War Cabinet approved the reply proposedby the Foreign Secretary.     The only question which arose was whether there was anything to be gained byplaying for time before sending off the reply.The War Cabinet decided that the reply shouldbe despatched that evening.      There was nothing newin the proposed offer, which, in substance, was thesame as previous offers, namely, that Hitler was prepared to call it off provided he could keep what hehad got.      It was also felt that it would be verydamning to have it on record that we had sent atemporizing reply to an offer of this kind.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Prime Minister proposed that the contents of these offers should be made known to president roosevelt, who should be informed that we had sent a refusal to an offer of peace, made to us at a timewhen the threat of invasion was imminent.It was agreed that the Minister without portfolio, acting for the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, should inform the Dominion high commissioners of the sense of this offer and of the reply sent thereto.The War Cabinet:-(1) Approved the despatch of the draft reply prepared by the foreign secretary.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretaryto inform President Roosevelt ofthe sense of the telegrams whichhad been received, and of the reply sent thereto.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toMOST   SECRET. ensure the secrecy of this document.

Tne Flag Officer,North Atlantic, had been informed.    The question was, what instructions should be given to him.It was pointed out that there were various alternatives^-(l) The French ships after passing throughthe Straits might intend to turn northto German-occupied ports in France:(2) They might turn south for Casablanca, inwhich case their object might be to leaveToulon in anticipation of a german occupation of southern France:(3) Or, again, they might be intending to goto Dakar, with a view to putting a stopto Operation &quot;Menace&quot;,As regards (1) THE FIRST SEA LORD said thatwe had always told the French that if their shipsattempted to&apos;go to German occupied ports we reservedright of action.     Clearly, therefore, we could not agreeto the French ships turning north after leaving Gibraltar.As between alternatives (2) and (3), the viewof the War Cabinet was that in many ways it would bedesirable that these French ships should go toCasablanca0     The question arose, however, whether,if we said that we would let them go to Casablancabut not to Dakar, this would show that we had someinterest in Dakar.     But this would not be materialif the object of the French in sending the ships toDakar was to forestall an operation of which they had obtained knowledge.It was agreed that it would be most undesirable to allow these French ships to go. to Dakar, where their arrival might make all the difference between afavourable and an unfavourable attitude when the&quot;Menace&quot; Expedition arrived.      Further, we couldargue that we had information that Dakar was German-controlled, but that Casablanca was not.

Summing up the discussion, THE PRIME 2&quot;ISJISTERproposed, and the War Cabinet agreed, to authorisethe First Lord to send instructions to the FlagOfficen North Atlantic, on the following lines:-( 1) RENOWN should get in touch with the french ships and ask their destination, making itclear that we could not allow them toproceed to German-occupied ports;(2) If the reply was that they were going south,&apos;we should ask \whether they were going toCasablanca.      If so, they should be informedthat we were prepared to agree to theirproceeding to that port.     The French ships should be shadowed if they went to Casablanca:(3) If the French ships should try to proceedbeyond Casablanca to Dakar, we should saythat we were unable to agree to that course.The First Lord of the Admiralty was also invitedto give directions that two of the Cruisers forming partof Force &quot;IT&quot; should be stationed so as to make sure that tne French ships did not make their wayinto Dakar.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
