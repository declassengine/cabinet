MINUTE 14.Confidential Annex.(2nd September, 1940 - 12 noon).The proposal to send further armoured unitsout of this country as reinforcements for the middle east gave rise to a short discussion as to the likelihood of invasion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he regarded fog,which was more likely in the autumn, as a great allyto an invader, more especially as fog was usuallyaccompanied &quot;by a calm sea.As against this, the FIRST SEA LORD said thatin the winter the use of barges and small fishing craft,in regard to which there had &quot;been so many reports, was outof the question;    or at least such craft could only heused on so few days that they could not form part of anyexpedition which started on a pre-arranged date.It was difficult to give any date after whichthe weather would deteriorate seriously, hut, after theequinoctial gales about 21st September, the weather was uncertain,,THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that, as aresult of the action which had been taken, our forces^were now widely spread.    He referred to the reinforcementssent to the Middle East (including the despatch of aircraft) and to Operation &quot;Menace&quot;.    He thought thatit would be agreed that we had acted with determinationin sending these forces out of the country at thepresent time,THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the indicationspointing to invasion had never been more positive thanthey were at the present time.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that he agreed with this view,THE PRIME MINISTER asked what action was beingtaken to knock, out the German batteries which were beinginstalled on the French coast.    He thought it was clearthat the German High Command would think in terms ofestablishing artillery which could fire across the straits of Dover9 and make   them    impassable to our shipping.

When this had &quot;been done, they would make a greateffort to establish air superiority over the Channel,and win a bridgehead on English soil.     The greatneed of the Germans to stages a successful invasionmust not be overlooked,THE FIRST SEA LORD described the steps which were being taken.    The first stage was that anumber of short-range guns were being established in the neighbourhood of Dover.    These would be effective as coast defence weapons.As a   secxmd s tage, it was proposed to erect certain turrets; which were available frombattleships.As a third stage, there was tine possibilityof erecting still larger guns of, say, 15-inehcalibre.     This, however, would take time.The War Cabinet took note of thisdiscuss ion.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.
