(40) 225thonclusions,inute6.)The War Cabinet had before them a Reportby the Chiefs of Staff (C.0.S.(40)4 (0)), relatingto the situation of the Operation &quot;Menace&quot;, as aresult   of the arrival at Dakar of French warshipreinforcements.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the operation&quot;Scipio&quot; was first conceived on the 4th August whenit was proposed that General de Gaulle should landwith a Free French Force in French West Africa whereit was hoped he would be welcomed.     This plan hadbeen approved in principle by the War Cabinets     Oi.the 7th August, 1940, General de Gaulle prepared anew plan which entailed landing at a West Africanport, giving a revised date for reaching there asabout the 10th September, 1940sOn the 8th August he (the prime Minister)had asked for a plan to be prepared, in which british forces should be included, in order to put general de Gaulle ashore..      In compliance with these instructions Operation &quot;Menace&quot; was planned-    the approximate date of arrival under this plan whichwas approved by the War Cabinet on the 13th August,1940, was 8th September, 1940.       Subsequently, this date was put back to the 12th September, 1940, butthe delay of 24 hours in operation &quot;Hats&quot; postponedit until the 13th.When this plan was submitted to the commanders they decided that it was essential thatthe expedition should go first to Freetown wherecertain refuelling and reloading would take place.This move added six days to the time at which the expedition could reach the rendezvous, i.e., theoperation was then timed to? the 18th September, 1940,This delay had been fatal.     At the time the original&quot;Scipio&quot; expedition had been conceived it had been necessary to take the Poles into our confidence asthey were taking part in it, and gradually word gotback to France, with the result that the vichy government had shown surprising resource and sent a force of warships, which, after refuelling at casablanca and eluding our forces sent to intercept themh a d arrived at Dakar-     This event had altered thewhole situation.     To undertake the operation &quot;Menace&quot;in these circumstances was, in his opinion, out ofthe question, and in view of the fact that the French warships might have troops on board would, ifattempted, end in bloodsheds

The   rime Minister continuing - said that afiasco had undoubtedly occurred, and it was to be hoped that it would not too much engage public attention.     The Chiefs of Staff now advised thatGeneral de Gaulle and his force should proceed atonce to Duala, disembark there, and advance intoChad province.     The British troops which had beensent out for the expedition would be brought back tothis country, with the exception of one battalion of Marines which would remain at Freetown-.The War Cabinet:-(a) Approved the recommendation of theChiefs of Staff that General de gaulle and his force should proceed at once to Duala, disembark there and advance into Chad province.(b) Approved the despatch of the draft telegram to Admiral Cunninghamgiving effect to (a) above.(Appendix )(c) Requested the Chiefs of Staff toconsider how they would dispose ofthe British forces forming part ofthe force for operation &quot;Menace&quot;..Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.

APPENDIX.Presence of French cruisers at Dakar rendersthe execution of Operation &quot;Menace&quot; impracticable^.Alternative Plans have been examined here.    Landing atKonakri does not appear to offer any chance of success in view of difficulty of communications to Bomako, the lack of transport with the force j, and the probability that forces from Dakar would forestall.     Moreover, closeblockade of Dakar from seaward is not possible with .the Naval forces available, and therefore presence of de Gaulle&apos;s force at Boraako would not appreciablyinfluence situation at Dakar.     Best plan appears to befor General de Gaulle&apos;s force to land at Duala with theobject of consolidating the Cameroons, Equatorial africa and Chad, and extending influence of de. Gaulle toLibreville.    The British portion of the force would remain for the present at Freetown.Unless General de Gaulle has any strong objections to. the latter course, it should be put intooperation, forthwith^
