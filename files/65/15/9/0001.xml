(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT,)MOST SECRET,prance.The french fleet,!(previous reference:W.M,(40) 254thConclusions,iflnute 2.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that sr*e.. iai cu: e may be taken to- ensure the secrecy of this oQcumeiQOPY NO.W.M. (40) 255th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(20th September, 1940, - 12 Noon.)THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the FrenchCruiser PRIMAUGUET had been intercepted by theCORNWALL and DELHI, and had agreed to go to Casablanca.She was now being escorted there.    The Captain ofthe PRIMAUGUET had stated that he was quite prepared. to fight, if need be, but that the Germans would bethe only gainers.    The crew had seemed in good order.The Three French Cruisers sighted by theAUSTRALIA had turned out to be the GEORGES LEYGUES,the MONTCALM. and the GLOIRE.     A report had beenreceived that these vessels were going down to french equatorial Africa to restore the position.    Thisreport was supported by the fact that, when signalledto by the AUSTRALIA, one of the French Cruisers had as-Kad what action we should take if they went toPoihte&quot; Noire.The AUSTRALIA had proceeded somewhat inadvance of the Cruisers, in order to be in a positionto cut them off from reaching a destination in french Equatorial Africa,     At 12 noon on the 19ththe AUSTRALIA had been joined by the CUMBERLAND and thetv/o ships had continued to shadow the French Cruisersuntil 6 p. m.    Shortly after this time the FrenchCruisers had turned back to the northward, and had increased their speed from 15 to 31 knots.The AUSTRALIA and the CUMBERLAND had not beenable to close with the three French ships.   At 9 p. m.the GLOIRE had had an engine breakdown, and her speedhad beenieduced to 15 knots.   Her Captain had asked to&quot;be allowed to proceed to Conakri, but had later agreedto return to Casablanoa, escorted by the AUSTRALIA,These two vessels would pass Dakar about midnight that night, and there was a possibility that Frenchsubmarines might then attack the AUSTRALIA.    The captain of the latter had accordingly informed the GLOIRE that ifhe was attacked by submarines, he would at once sink theGLOIRE,The CUMBERLAND had continued to shadow theother two French Cruisers, the GEORGES LEYGUES and theMONTCALM.    At one time, touch had been lost in a heavyrainstorm, and had only been regained at 5-30 a.m, whenthe ships were only 30 miles from Dakar.    The CUMBERLANDhad signalled to the French ships and had endeavoured to get them to stop;   but the French vessels had said thatthey must receive orders from the Admiral at Dakar,

In the result, the two French Cruisers had got -into Dakar without being fired on,    The first sea Lord thought that the return to Dakar of thetwo Cruisers, after being chased in, but without having been fired on, would not have a very-inspiring effect on the morale of the other french ships.    Indeed, he thought the effect on stiffeningthe morale of the pro*-Vichy forces would have beengreater if the two ships had limped into harbourafter having been fired on and with a number ofwounded on board,,THE PRIME&apos; MINISTER said that he thought the result was by no means unsatisfactory,,    Itwas true that two of the three French Cruisers had got back to Dakar, but the PRIMAUGUET was nolonger there.    The French Naval forces were therefore only one ship up on balance,ion &quot;MENACE,&quot; Continuing, the FIRST SEA LORD said thatthe motor transport vessels forming part of operation &quot;Menace&quot; had sailed from Freetown onthe previous night, and the transports were sailingthat morningo    It appeared, therefore,that admiral Cunningham would be able to collect all his forces in time to bring off the operation on Sunday, 22nd September,,   Presumably theAUSTRALIA, after shepherding the GLOIRE some wayto the north &quot;of Dakar, should turn south, so asto be able to take   part in the Operation.THE -MINISTER OF INFORMATION referred tothe recent change which had taken place in Frenchopinion.    He thought that there was a risk of asetback in this change of opinion, if british ships once again had to fire on French ships.Indeed, some French journalists whom he had seen on the previous night, thought that such an action might finish the de Gaulle movement,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the effectmight well be the opposite.    General Catroux, whohad been informed of our intentions, was all infavour of the Operation going forward.Later in the Meeting, a message wasreceived to the effect that, at General de Gaulle&apos;request, Operation &quot;Menace&quot; was being postponed for 24 hours.The War Cabinet took note ofthis statement,,Richmond Terrace, S,W01*
