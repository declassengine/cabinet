(43) 114th&apos; Conclusions,Minute 4).On the 15th August four telegrams had beenreceived from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid(Nob.  1404,  1405,  1406 and 1407).      These telegramsreported that two Italians.  General Castellano, Chiefof General Aubrosio&apos;s Military Office, and Signor,Montanaro, of Consulta, had come officially and with full authority from Marshal Badoglio to put the Italianposition before His Majesty&apos;s Government and to make a specific proposal.      They had presented credentials fromHis Majesty&apos;s&quot;Minister to the Holy See.      They were proceeding to Lisbon under cover of an Italian Mission.The broad upshot of the approach was that thewhole of Italy was in favour of peace, and that feeling against the Germans was intense;    that the ItalianGovernment were prepared to join the Allies and fight against Germany when the Allies landed, but werepowerless until this took place.These telegrams had been repeated to Quebec,together with the comments of the Foreign Secretory.The War Cabinet now had before them telegramFAN 196 of 18th August sent to General Eisenhower bythe Combined Chiefs of Staff, with the approval of thePrime Minister and the President of the United States,directing him to send two staff officers to Lisbon for discussions with these Italian emissaries.      this telegram set out the lines of a communication to be madeby the staff officers to these emissaries.        the communication was to open with an indication that Italy&apos;sunconditional surrender was accepted on the termsstated in the document which was to be handed to him;and the officers were then to hand him the shortarmistice terms set out in telegram CONCRETE 311.s    Itwould then be made clear that these terms did notvisualise Italy&apos;s active assistance in fighting theGermans;     but that the extent to which the terms mightmodified in favour of Italy would depend on how far theItalian Government and people did in fact aid theUnited Nations against Germany during&apos; the remainder ofthe war.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that this telegram made it clear that the president and the Prime Minister were in agreement with the line which the War Cabinet had recommended in connection withthe approaches made by Signor Berio at Tangier.      It was unfortunate that the full armistice terms had not yet beenagreed between the British and United States authorities;for the short terras which these staff officers were tocommunicate to the Italian Emissary at Lisbon would haveto be supplemented later by additional conditionsincluding political,  economic and financial terms.s See W. M. (43) 108th Conclusions.-1-

THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OP STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS said that the Soviet Government had beeninformed of the earlier approach,  and it was desirablethat they should be informed of this approach at theearliest possible moment.      The Prime Minister had alreadybeen ashed whether he agreed that such a communication should be sent at once to the Soviet Government.As regards the supplementation of the shortterms,  the only supplementary document at present available was one which had been prepared by the U. S,authorities.   - This was unsatisfactory in variousrespects.      The Foreign Office were preparing analternative draft which would be sent to Quebec as soonas it was completed.In discussion the question was raised -whetherthis approach could be regarded as reliable.      The rfarCabinet were informed that Marshal Badoglio had sent a written communication to His Majesty&apos;s Minister to the holy See to the effect that this emissary was the authorised representative of the Italian Government.It was true that there was nothing to prevent theItalian Government from repudiating him after the event.They could say that he was not a plenipotentiary,  andthat he had no authority to agree to unconditional surrender.      Nevertheless,  the terms which would be handed to him were fully satisfactory from our pointof view   in the sense that they represented a Unilateralinstrument which was not to be negotiated.In this connection attention was drawn to thefact that paragraph 3 of these terms provided that noprisoners or internees of the United Nations now in Italy&quot;may from the beginning of these negotiations be evacuated to Germany&apos;1.      The use of the term &quot;negotiations&quot;was unfortunate and,  if the terms were subsequentlypublished, might be quoted in support of the contention that this was a negotiated agreement and not an unconditional surrender./The Tar Cabinet took the view that the word&quot;negotiations1&apos; should,  if possible, be deleted from thisparagraph before the document was communicated to theItalian&quot;emissary.      Some discussion followed as to thebest way of meeting this point with the least alteration in the text.      It was eventually agreed that the most convenient course would be to suggest that,  for the phrase &quot; from the beginning of these negotiations&quot; thereshould be substituted &quot;now or at any time&quot;.The War Cabinet(l) Took note of the instructions sent toGeneral Eisenhower in telegram FAN 196.(2) Invited the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to suggest to the PrimeMinister; by telephone,  that paragraph 3of the proposed terms should be amended- in the sense indicated at &quot;X&quot; above.

(3) Subject to obtaining the Prime Minister&apos;concurrence as at (s) above,  asked theForeign Office to telegraph to HisMajesty&apos;a Ambassador at Lisbon to ensurethat this alteration was made in the document before the two staff officershanded it to the Italian emissary.(4) Took note that the Secretary of Statefor dominion Affairs would inform theDominion Prime Ministers of this latestapproach by the Italians and of thesubstance of the instructions containedin telegram FAN 196.NOTE:    Subsequent to the meeting the concurrence ofthe Prime Minister was obtained to thisalteration,  which was notified to his majesty s Ambassador at Lisbon,Offices of the War Cabinet,S. &apos;.&apos;/. 1.
