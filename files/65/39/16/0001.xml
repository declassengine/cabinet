THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR expressed theview that if the military-political Commission wasgiven the functions of advising the Supreme allied commander -in-Chief, the result would be to hamperhis actions.      Moreover, ouch a Commission would tend to duplicate the existing channel of communicationby which General Eisenhower received his instructions on. political matters from the British and american governments through the Combined Chiefs of Staff.On the ether hand, it was pointed out that the&apos;terms of Marshal Stalin&apos;s original proposal,  in whichhe spoke of organising a Commission &quot;with the purposeof considering the questions concerning thenegotiations with the different Governments dissociatingthemselves from Germany&quot;,  certainly seemed to contemplate a much wider scope for the Commission.Such a Commission would however more appropriately be located in London (or in one of the other Capitalsof the United Rations) rather than in Sicily, .At their previous Meeting the Aar Cabinet hadtaken the view that we hod everything to gain byprompt and willing recognition of the principle thatthe chief United Nations should act in co-operation inthese matters.      Although,  therefore. Marshal Stalin&apos;proposal might not seem altogether appropriate in itspresent form,, it was the general view of the WarCabinet that we must at all costs avoid making any suggestion which might seem to show reluctance toaccept his proposal,      Ue should,  however,  endeavourto handle the matter in such a way that the proposed commission,   once established,  could be developed intoa body on the lines which we had in mind,,In this connection it was,  of course,  relevantthat Marshal Stalin (see telegram CONCRETE 569) had proposed a meeting of representatives on the foreign secretary level in the near future,  and that,  in the interim message proposed by the Prime Minister and despatched by the President, we and the United states had signified our acceptance of this suggestion.This meeting would,  now   doubt,  provide a convenient opportunity for the discussion of the future scope ofthe proposed Commission and its locale.The Foreign Secretary circulated to the tfarCabinet conies of a draft reply to WELFARE  44-9,prepared before the Meeting,      This draft, a copy ofwhich is appended to this Annex9 was considered,  andit was agreed that amendments should be made to dealwith the fo11owing points:-(a) Paragraph 1 should be made more general bythe omission of the concluding words&quot;on Italian problems,  as a beginning&quot;.

(b) After per a graph 1, a new paragraph shouldhe inserted,  pointing out that, sincethe proposal for the Commission had first been made, the three Governmentsconcerned had agreed on the armistice terms for Italy, and had authorisedGeneral Eisenhower to sign on their behalf.      Premier Stalin would perhaps-  no longer wish the Commission to meetii: Sicily, where there would be littlework for it to do.      But we should indicate our willingness to the Commissionstarting its work in Sicily,  if premier stalin attached importance to this. .It should,  however, be added that in ourview it would be more appropriate thatthe Commission should meet at Algiers,since this was an established AlliedHeadquarters, rather than in Sicily.(c) This would lead on to a reference to the wider functions which the commission might perform,  o.g.,  in regard to the axis satellites5 and to a suggestionthat its transfer to London,  at a later date,  might be convenient.;,(d) It -was desirable to omit the words &quot;exceptin case of emergency&quot; in paragraph 2 ofthe draft telegram, since in emergencythe Comma nder-i n-Chief would have toact on his own responsibility.(e) The telegram should stress, somewhat more fully than was done in paragraph 5 ofthe draft,  the difficulties which were likely to ensue if the Commission wasto - be given powers in relation tonatters within the jurisdiction of theCommander-in-chief,  on which the latterat present received instructions from the..U. 3.  and U. K.  Governments through the combined Chiefs of Staff.(f) It was thought that the suggestion of adding a representative of the french committee of National Liberation tothe Commission was unlikely to be acceptable to the Americans:  or to theRussians.      It should be stated that inthe V/ar Cabinet&apos;s view this suggestionshould not be pressed, but that representatives of both the french committee and of the minor european allies should be called into consultation,when the Commission dealt with questionsof immediate concern to them.

The war Cabinet -Invited the Foreign Secretary to modify the draft telegram to the Prime minister in the light of the discussion,    &apos; the telegram   would be shown in draft tothe Chiefs of Staff (by virtue of their interest in the present arrangements forissuing instructions to General Eisenhower)and, after approval by the Deputy Prime- Minister, should be despatched to thePrime Minister without further referenceto the War Cabinet. v. o fj ,^__I     L*MMJ  tl*&apos; c4*A $Mil).The War Cabinet were also informed of the latestposition in regard to emissaries from the ItalianGovernment.From telegrams circulated to them,  the WarCabinet were already aware that General Castellanoand Signor Montanara had left Lisbon on their returnto Rome, but so far no communication had been receivedsince their return,  and IL/M,  Minister at the Holy Seehad been asked to find out what had happened.Meanwhile, on the 26th August another ItalianGeneral, by name Zanussi, principal assistant to theChief of the   Army     Staff (General Roata), had arrived by air in Lisbon,  accompanied by General Cartonde Wiart;  who had been released from his prism campand told that he was to accompany to Lisbon an ItalianGeneral who was empowered to discuss armistice terms.General Zanussi knew about General Castellano&apos;mission.      General Carton de Winrt stated thatGeneral Zanussi had been sent owing to GeneralCastellano&apos;s failure to return to Rome.General Zanussi was given, at Lisbon, the comprehensive text of the armistice terms and had proceeded to Algiers.      It was contemplated that hewould return thence to Rome via Sicily.The War Cabinet were informed that a telegram had been received from General Eisenhower to theeffect that he was apprehensive as to the result of the comprehensive text of the armistice terms having beengiven to General Zanussi,  since General Roata was known to be strongly pro-German.        General Eisenhowerfeared that General Zanussi might have been sent by the production-German party to find out the facts about GeneralCas te11ano &apos;s mission.The view was expressed that as General Zanussiwas now at Algiers,   it was for General Eisenhower todecide what action should now be taken in regard tohis onward journey.THE VICE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that there was some reason to think that GeneralCastellano had returned to Rome and might shortly begetting into direct communication with GeneralBis enhower.

The &quot;oar Cabinet were informed that Signor Grandihad arrived in Lisbon in the same aeroplane as general Zanussi, having boarded it at Seville.Signor Grandi purported to ho anxious to establishcontacts with us.,      V/e had,  however, been informedthat the Badoglio Government were not favourably disposed towards Signor Grandi,  and on this andother grounds wo ought not to have any dealings with him.The Y/ar Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to inform the Prime Minister ofthe above views in regard to Signor Grandi,Offices of the War Cabinet,S.

APPENDIX

Draft telegram to the Prime Minister.

Your Welfare No. 449.

The proposal for a Three Power Commission should we think be accepted and every effort made to get it to work at the earliest possible moment on Italian problems as a beginning.



2. In our view members of Commission should be political representatives appointed by the three Governments each reporting to his Government direct. Representatives could have Service advisers. They would be kept informed by their Governments of military and political developments affecting their work and would in their turn inform their Governments of developments locally. They would make joint recommendations to their Governments but would not have power to take final decisions, except in a case of emergency.



3. We think Algiers would probably be a better seat for the Commission than Sicily if only because it is an established Allied Headquarters.



4. We should welcome the addition of a representative of the French Committee of Liberation with the  Commission although if either Americans or Russians are opposed to it we should not wish to press it at this stage. We also think that representatives of minor European Allies might be called into consultation when Commission deals with questions which immediately concern them.



5. There are however a number of matters arising out of the establishment of the Commission on the lines indicated above which require further study and upon which we should make up our own minds. Having done so we should raise them with the Russians at the proposed Three Power meeting. These are: (a) the scope of the Commission. Should it deal in due course with Germany as well as with minor Satellite States? (b) What are the relations of the Commission to be with the Combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington through whom political guidance to Commander-in-Chief is at present transmitted by the two Governments? (c) Where would the permanent domicile of the Commission be? We think it would be an advantage for the Commission to meet in London at some stage. This might be when Italian situation is clearer. London would be better for dealing with Axis satellites.



6. Para. 5 above deals with long term matters which are not capable of immediate decision. Ponding our decision we should proceed on the lines of (2) (3) and (4) above.

Unparaphrased version of a Most SecretCypher Telegram not One Time Table-CONCRETE NO. 665.TOO. 311725Z,TOD. 311855Z.MOST SECRET CYPHER TELEGRAMMOST IMMEDIATEFrom: Air Ministry.To: Quadrant.CONCRETE no 665.     31st August, 1943,Following for Prime Minister from deputy prime Minister and Foreign Secretary.Your WELFARE NO. 449.1. The proposal for a Three-Power commission should we think be accepted and every effort made togot it to work at the earliest possible moment.2, Since Stalin made his proposal he has agreed to tho armistice terms for Italy and authorisedGeneral Eisenhower to sign them on behalf of theSoviet Government, so perhaps he will no longer wishtho Commission to meet in Sicily where there may belittle work for it&apos;to do.    If however he stillattaches importance to it starting its work in Sicily,we should certainly agree so as not to give theimpression that we are trying to make unnecessarydifficulties.    Incidentally we think Algiers wouldprobably be a better seat for the Commission thanSicily, since it is an established Allied headquarters.3. From the wording of Staling message Itis clear that he contemplates that the commission should handle not merely the Italian question butalso questions affecting other Axis satellites whichdissociate themselves from Germany.     In thesecircumstances it would be convenient that the commission should not prolong its stay in Sicily or Algierslonger than is absolutely necessary but should transferitself as soon as possible to London., which would clearly be a better centre from which to carry onits work./4.    In our view

its work./4. In our view members of commission should bo political representatives appointed bythe throe Governments, each reporting to hisGovernment direct.    Representatives&apos; could haveService advisors.    They should be kept informed bytheir Governments of military and political develop- .merits affecting their work and would in their turninform their Governments of developments locally. -They would make joint recommendations to their governments but would not have power to take final decisions.    They would of course not interfere withthe military functions of the Commander-in-Chief,5. Wo are doubtful as to the addition ofa representative of the French Committee of Liberation,as the Americans will certainly not like it and theRussians may suspect that we are trying to upset thebalance of the Commission to their detriment.    Butwe think that representatives of both.the french committee and of minor European allies should becalled into consultation by the Commission whenever the latter deals with questions.which immediatelyconcern&apos;them.    The position of the Dominions, whohave been in on the formulation of the Italian terms,will also have to be considered when the final formof the machinery is being worked out.6. There are a number of matters arisingout of the establishment of the Commission on thelines indicated above which require further study and upon which we. should make up our own minds.Having done so we should raise them with theRussians at the proposed Three Power meeting.These are:(a) The scope of the Commission.Should it deal in due coursewith Germany as well as withminor satellite States?(b) What are the relations of theCommission to -be with the combined Chiefs of Staff in washington through whompolitical guidance to Commander-in-Chief is at present transmitted by the two Governments?/7.
