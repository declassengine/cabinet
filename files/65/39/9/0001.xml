THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;g GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........Sscvy^^DST SECRET. ,38toTRADE disputes and TRADEONIONS ACT,  1987.(previous reference:W^M. (43) 111thConclusions,Minute 3).W.M.(45)  115th CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE confidential Annex(9th August,  1943:    5.30 p.in. )At their Meeting on 4th August, the War cabinet had invited the Secretary of State for Dominion .Affairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle the terms of an agreed communique regarding thedeputation which the Prime Minister had received from three Civil Service Unions.    The War Cabinet tedagreed that,  if the representatives of the unions were willing,  this should include a statement of theconsequences which would ensue if the applicationnow pending for affiliation to the T.U.C.  wasproceeded with;    but that,  in default of agreement,this matter should be dealt with government statement.in a separate the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that therepresentatives of the Unions had not been willing that the communique regarding the deputation should include this warning of the consequences which would follow if a Civil Service Union became affiliated withthe T.U.C. The communiqueconfined to an announcementbeen received.issued had. therefore, beenthat the deputation hadAfter their interview with the Prime minister the representatives of the Unions had seen Sir WalterCitrine and representatives of the Union of PostalWorkers with a view to seeing whether the applicationfor affiliation might not be withdrawn;    but it was understood that this approach had been unsuccessful.In these circumstances it seemed desirable that theGovernment should proceed without further delay toissue the statement regarding the consequences ofaffiliation to the T.U. C.      It was the Government^duty to make the position clear to members of theUnion of Postal Workers.And there was some reasonto think that, if their position was made clear tothem, members of the Union might &apos;bring pressure tobear on the Executive with a view to the withdrawalof the application for affiliation.The position had been made more difficult bythe publication in certain nev/spapers,  on the 8th and August,  of statements indicating that theGovernment were seeking a compromise.      these statements had caused apprehension among members ofthe Conservative Party;    and it was unfortunate thatthe impression should be created that the Governmentwere /proposing to compromise on this issue whileParliament was in recess.

In these circumstances the Chancellor suggested thata Government statement should he issued forthwith (a) making-it clear that further discussion had been ruled out bythe threat implied by the action of the Union of PostalWorkers in seeking affiliation with the T.U.C. .  and that theissue raised in regard to the. amendment of Section 5 couldnot be dealt.with in present circumstances;    and (b)explaining the consequences which would follow if thatapplication were granted.The draft of a statement which the Chancellor had prepared was circulated at the meeting.THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER said that  in his view this statement should be confined to an explanation of theconsequences which would follow if the acolication foraffiliation to the T. U. C.  were granted.    &quot;He had therefore prepared an alternative draft    confined to that point,  copies.of which were also circulated at the meeting.In discussion,  objection was - taken on two grounds tothat part of the Chancellor&apos;s draft which made the point that further discussions could not take place under&quot;a threat to flout the Law -(a) Some Ministers felt that,- if the statementsought to summarise the course of events which had led up to the present position,a much fuller statement should be made, togive a balanced summary of the negotiations.(b) It -was the general vie?/ of the War Cabinet thata statement that the Government were not&apos; prepared to negotiate under a threat might beheld to imply some promise that they wouldhe ready to discuss the position if this threat were withdrawn.      In fact,   the PrimeMinister had informed the deputation that hecoirld net hold out any hope that the Governmentwould find it possible to propose any amendmentof the Act even if the present threat were withdrawn.-   THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that in his view it was most important to correct the impression created bythe recent statements in the newspapers that the PrimeMinister was seeking some compromise solution.      While he did not press the precise wording used in his draft, he felt that the Government announcement should include adefinite statement that the issues raised regarding theamendment of Section 5 of the Act could not be dealt within present circumstances.Various suggestions were mode for amendment of thedraft proposed &quot;by the Deputy Prime Minister with a viewto meeting the point raised by the Chancellor of theExchequer.      It was eventually agreed that this point could best he met. by the immediate issue of a dementito the effect, that there was no foundation for the suggestions made in certain newspapers that the Governmentwere considering a oompromise with regard to the TradeDisputes Act.    If such a dementi were&apos; issued forthwith, .the formal Government statement,  which would be issued

separately,  could be confined to the warning as to theconsequences which would follow if the Union of PostalWorkers were affiliated to the T.U.C., and this warningmight then &quot;be given in the terms proposed in the draftsuggested by the Deputy Prime Minister,      This draftfollowed very closely the wording of the statementprepared,  with the concurrence of the Minister of Labourand National Service,  for the Prime Minister&apos;s,use inreceiving the rece it deputation.      It was felt, however,that in view of his special responsibilities in thismatter, the Minister&apos; of Labour and National Service shouldbe given -an opportunity to comment on the terms of thedraft announcement and on the expediency of issuing it atthis particular moment.      The concurrence of the HomeSecretary should also be obtained.The War Cabinet -(l) Invited the Minister of Information to informthe Press at once that there was nofoundation for the statements published i ncertain newspapers to the effect that theGovernment were considering a compromisewith regard to the Trade Disputes Act.(2) Agreed that,  subject to the concurrence ofthe Minister of Labour and National Serviceand the Home Secretary,  a statement shouldbe issued on &quot;behalf of the Government atthe earliest opportunity in the followingtermss-&quot;The Union of Post Office Workers have madeapplication for affiliation to the TradesUnion Congress. &apos;    It is understood thatthis application will be considered atthe forthcoming conference in September.It is important that Members of the service should realise in advance the position inwhich they would be placed if an association of which they ore members wereaffiliated to the T. U.C.      The effect ofthe law is absolutely clear,      If an association of which established civilservants are members becomes so affiliatedi the result follows that the warningcontemplated by the Act must be given to&apos; every established civil servant who is amember of the association.      If at the endof one month thereafter that establishedcivil servant has not resigned hismembership of the association,  heautomatically becomes disqualified forbeing a member of the Civil Service.Thereupon all his accumulated pension rights ore forfeited.      It is theGovernment&apos;s duty to state this positionclearly and the duty of the Civil Serviceorganisations to bring it to the noticeof their members.&quot;the War Cabinet,
