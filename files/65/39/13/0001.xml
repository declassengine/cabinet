Dissatisfaction hod also been caused by theoriginal proposals for the award of the North Africa Star,From the Canadian point of view it almost looked as though the conditions for this award had been so designed as tc exclivrlo Canadian troops,After hearing these views the Prime Minister had made a conciliatory statement, which had been well received.It wok  evident, however,  that there was considerableresentment in Canada on these matters.Policy in regard to France had next been discussed.While Canadian Ministers were content that the U. K.Government should hold separate discussions with theU.8.   Government regarding their attitude towardsthe French Committee of National Liberation, they claimed that no announcement of policy should be made by theU,K,  Government until Dominion Governments had been ableto consider their policy so that they would be in aposition to make a simultaneous announcement.Canadian Ministers had shown some anxiety&apos; aboutthe post-war position of the Soviet Government.    ThePrime Minister had said that in his view Russian policyafter the war might be dominated by their desire to beadmitted to collaboration on an equal footing withother Governments;    and that this might lead to a profoundchange in the attitude of the Soviet Government, ascompared with their attitude before the war.The meeting had also discussed the question ofcivil aviation.    (The Lord Presidents statement on thismatter,   and the discussion which followed, are recorded in a separate Minute - see W.M.(43) 117th Conclusions,Minute 3).The following were among the points raised in thediscussion which followed the Lord President&apos;s statement(a)    As regards the employment of Canadian Forces,  theSECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR recalled that in the early stages of the war- General McNaughton had been mostinsistent that the Canadian Forces should be engaged asan Army, and not as separate Divisions - with the resultthat it had not been possible to use them at all on active operations.    At a later stage this limitation hadin effect been withdrawn;    and Colonel Ralston had asked that separate Canadian Divisions should be used in active operations.    It had been too late to include them in theforces sent to North Africa;    but two Divisions had beenearmarked for the Moroccan campaign;    and in the end one division had been sent to Sicily0THE LORD PRESIDENT said that Mr.  Mackenzie King&apos;swish was that the Canadian force to be employed   in active operations should be not less than two Divisions with aseparate Army Corps Headquarters.(b)    Every effort had been made, in the past to givedue credit,  in published communiques,  to the military contribution of&quot;the Dominions.    Indeed, we had been criticised in the  oast for giving undue prominence tothe exploits of Dominion troops    to the disadvantage ofBritish forces drawn from the United Kingdom.    It was

recognised., however,   that the earlier communiques whichhad Been criticised cr. this ground were concerned withtroops from Dominions ether than Canada,  as canadian troops were not at that time engaged on active operations,.(c) The view was expressed that we had failed togive sufficient credit in public statements to the outstanding contribution made by Canada in the financialand economic spheres,&apos;    THE LORD PRESIDENT pointed outthat this had not been male   the subject of any complaintby Canadian Ministeas^(d) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat his information had indicated that there had been anunder-current of feeling on these matters in Canada forsome time past;    but- that Canadians had refrained from giving public expression to this feeling so long as thefortunes of war seemed to be going against us..    It wasnot perhaps surprising that these feelings should hovebeen released now that the tide had began to.turn in our favour,THE WAR CABINET 1Took note that the official record ofthe proceedings at this meeting in Quebecw-. eld be circulated to the War cabinet as soon as it -was received in this country.Offices of the War Cabinet;,E,,Wt, 1, .20th August..  1943,
