The following measures would be necessary:-(a)Intake into the Women&apos;s Services would have to bereduced to a minimum.     No more volunteers could beaccepted for these Services, except for certain special posts. ,   No further women would,be con-scripted under the National Service Acts for the&apos; time being;    now classes registered would bedirected into essential industry.     But the numberof those already Subject to tho National service acts who had expressed a preference for the Women&apos;services would exceed those required to meet the reduced allocations of the Services;    and an attemptwould have    to be made to persuade as many aspossible of these to go into the aircraft industryuntil they could be called up for the Service whichthey -desired to join.(b) Women would have to be registered for employment upto the age of -50, instead of 46 as at present.(c) The calling-up for the Services of men on Ministryof Aircraft Production work would have to be severely curtailed.(d) In deciding where the cuts should be made in thelabour force working for the Ministry of Supply much less regard would have to be paid to the needs ofproduction;    the main consideration would have tobe the need for releasing labour in areas where itcould be readily re-absorbed in Ministry of aircraft production factories.      It would also be necessary-1-

that the workers released should,  to the largestpracticable extent-, be mobile women and not, as atpresent, -a cross-section of the total labour force.(e) The local officials of the Ministry of Labour wouldhave to concentrate on filling Ministry of aircraft production vacancies;    and for this purpose tho.Ministryof Aircraft Production should provide monthly returns of unfilled vacancies.      The Ministry of aircraft production should also take all practicable stepsto satisfy themselves that the firms really required the numbers demanded,(if) The R.A.F. mechanics who had not yet been returnedto the .R.A.F. would have to be left in the aircraft industry. .-&apos;The Minister said that, if he were authorised tointroduce all these measures, and if he could bo assured that effective steps would be taken to keep wastage from the aircraft industry within reasonable limits (e*g. by developing personnel management within the industry)  andif he could assume some additional supply of man-power from further reductions in tho Civil Defence Services, hethought it might be possible to increase the labour forcein aircraft production by 100,000 during the last five months of the year?Since the War Cabinet&apos;s last discussion the Ministryof Aircraft Production had received the firms&apos;  estimates of their labour requirements in the second half of theyear.     According to these estimates tho needs of theindustry were only 160,000 for the half year, and, in thelight of past experience, it could be assumed that these estimates were inflatedo      The Minister believed that, bythe administrative measures which he had outlined, the man-power neods of the aircraft industry during this period wouldbe fully met*THE MINISTER OP PRODUCTION said that he could not agree&quot;that in determining the means by which their labour force should be reduced the Ministry of Supply should disregard the needs of production to the extent implied at (d)above, &apos;   He,thought, however, that the objects which theMinister of Labour had in mind could be achieved if theMinistry of Supply, instead of aiming at a purely statisticaltarget of releases totalling a specified figure,  con-centrated rather on releasing labour in areas where itcould readily be absorbed in Ministry of Aircraft Productionfactories,,He also thought it would be helpful if a part of the equipment of some of the aircraft factories which were atpresent under-nannod were transferred into engineering orfilling RoO*Ps. which were now redundant owing to thecontraction&apos; in the Ministry of Supply programme;    these factories would then work on aircraft production^     Thelabour available In the m.a.;p&apos;o factories could be used toman the remaining plant on a two-shift basis;   and doubleshifts could also bo worked on the transferred plant in itsnew site.

Looking further ahead, the&apos; Minister suggested that full valuewas not likely to he obtained from the reductions contemplated inthe labour force working for the Ministry of Supply unless a policyof concentration was applied to the munitions industries on linessomewhat similar to that which had been adopted for the purpose of contract ing civilian Industry.THE PRIME MINISTER said that,   in carrying through this transfer,of effort from Ministry of Supply work to Ministry of aircraft production work.,  the maximum practical effect should be given tothe principle- of bringing the work to the people.     This was clearly the most economical! method of transfer,   since it avoided the humandifficulties and the wastage involved in seeking to transfer labour from one area to another.It was explained that efforts were already being made to ease the man-power problem by transferring production from one area toanother.      And the suggestion made by the Minister of production for the dispersal of Ministry of Aircraft Production work intouf    redundant Ministry of^/A-ir craft Production- factories was itself anapplication of the principle suggested by the Prime Minister.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that the allocationproposed by the Prime Minister had,  of course, received the most careful consideration by the Board.of Admiralty.      The Admiralty&apos;sstatement of their requirements over the calendar year 19U3 hadcontained no allowance for contingencies and had taken, into account the suggestions for economies made in the Prime Minister*s Paper.The First Lord of the Admiralty proceeded to  cite some instances of the economies which had been effected.      Thus, thecomplements of capital ships and cruisers had now been so farreduced that the main armament and the anti-aircraft guns couldnot be manned simultaneously,,      Motor-craft were another example.This force was now manned on the basis of six crews for eightboats,  so as to ensure that no crews were idle while thexv vessels were under repair,      It had already been arranged to pay off throe&quot;R&quot; Class battleships,  two &quot;C&quot; and two i!D&quot; Class cruisers.      Whenaccount was taken of the losses which we must expect to incur inforthcoming operations,  it was not possible to pay off any more ofthe larger ships,      A further instance was that 12,000 men hadbeen combed out from the NaVy as a whole by intense efforts overa long period.&apos; , THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE said that he had so far proceeded on the assumption that the Admiralty would receivein 19h3 the allocation made to them in the War Cabinet&apos;s decisionof 11th December,  19h2n     &quot;This meant an increase of 16,000 over and above the allocation proposed by the Prime Minister.      He had not,however, made any allowance for the further increa.se of h-3,000asked for by the Navy*The view of the War Cabinet, as shown in discussion,  indicatedgeneral agreement with the view that the Navy should notbe cut below the figure allotted to them in the War Cabinet&apos;decision of [December,,  19h2.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that on this basis the Navy would still be U3;000 below their estimated requirements.,)      This figure was made up&apos;of 17,950 for the Navy proper, and 25,250 for manningland lag- craft, \&quot;Dealing with the former figure, this was equivalent to the crews required to man 62 new destroyers or 115 corvettes.      If thepresent decision was adhered to, the Admiralty would be forced to

put new destroyers and corvettes, as they were completed, in reserve,     instead of commissioning then and employing them ontasks for which they were urgently required in fulfilment of theprogramme approved by the War Cabinet - a programme, moreover,which had been framed in relation to essential strategic needs.*H THE PRIME MINISTER said that,  rather than agree to this,  itmight be necessary for the Admiralty to lay up a certain number ofships of other classes,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that we should require allthe ships now - in commission, daring the ensuing six months.as regards the requirement for crews for landing-craft, thf.deficit would mean that the lift for Operation &quot;OVERLO D&quot; would bereduced by one-third,, the reduction in&quot; lift applicable to theBritish forces engaged in that Operation being one-half.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in due course it might benecessary to see whether the Americans could provide a larger pro-portion of our combined landing fleets,      It was clearly impossibleto maintain the allocation which he had proposed for the Army andthe R, A.F. , and at the same time to make available the men askedfor by the Admiralty for manning landing-craft.      He thought thatthe Chiefs of Staff might have to advise on the relative import-ance of these cj/ inis,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that at the last meeting he had undertaken that the Air Ministry would do their best to workto the allocation proposed.      This meant that (assuming the Mo A.P.programme were achieved) the operational strength of the Royal AirForce would be 20% greater than it was now, &apos;-i&amp;^sBr-^hQ^gl^h.(y^7orir^only-have ^ecol-ved &apos;-aa---ij3:Q^.Q-a-se of one-g^^te^arth^-a^^^After allowance had been made for wastage, the Force would only be ,000 larger than it was to-dayc      Indeed,  if no more of the 9,000R.A.F. mechanics lent to MoAoP, were returned,  the Royal Air force would actually be 2,000 men smaller than it was today.In further discussion, THE PRIME MINISTER stiggested that thereshould be an enquiry into the establishment of R.A.F* squadronswith a view to effecting further reductions in the proportion of ground-staff to air-crews..The War Cabinet was Informed that the number of ground staffper squadron varied according to the type of squadron and the con-ditions under which the squadrons operated.It was pointed out that if the total number of men in the RoyalAir Force today,  1,150,000, was divided by the total number of first-line aircraft,  say 6,000,, the result was, a figure of about 200 menper machineo  &apos;  THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the authorities ofthe Royal Air Force should not be content with this figure.     Forhis part, he felt sure that reductions both could and should be made,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that this figure gave anentirely misleading view of the position,  since it took into account the whole of the training, equipment, maintenance and ancillaryorganisations-.     Furthermore, a year ago he had volunteered a cut of 100,000,  and his demands had subsequently been redxiced by afurther 225,000a      This cut had resulted in reduced efficiency, andhe asked that the groat and continuous efforts which had been madeto effect economies in the organisation of the Royal Air force should receive their due recognition.THE PRIME MINISTER said that,  in view of the grave shortage of personnel, he thought it might be necessary to ask that theSecretary of State for Air and two of his Ministerial colleagues should hold an enquiry to see whether further economies in personnel could not be effected.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that on tho PrimeMinister&apos;s allocation he would only receive 25,000 men and 3,000women for the five months August-December, 1943,-,     Since the monthly wastage was about %000,  the result was that the army would start to shrink: almost at oncecBuilding THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE said that,  asLabour,    stated in the Memorandum by the Minister of Production (W.P,(43)31l),  he had undertaken to find another 10,000 men for thebuilding programme for the months of August and September.     TheUnited States authorities should be pressed to bring overadditional Construction Troops as quickly as possible in orderto make about 15s000 additional men available from Octoberonwar ds r.It was generally agreed that no action should be taken atthis stage which would give the impression that we were not taking all possible steps to prepare airfields for the recap-tion   of U^S, aircraftoOther A reduction in this gro\ip from 102,000 to TO,000 was essential contemplated.industrial-ies and The War Cabinet agreed that the Lord President should beServices.invited to settle the allocations within this group0     In doing so he would take into account the question, mentioned in discussion, whether any further reduction should be made in thelabour force employed on road workoCivil The figures given by the Minister of Labour and NationalDefence. Service for the supply of man-power to aircraft productioncontemplated a reduction of 25,000 in Civil Defence.THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITY saidthat he weald wish for an opportunity of stating his views onthis matter.      He was satisfied that it would be impossible,in the circumstances, to effect a reduction of this magnitude.General. THE PAxl&apos;L,STHR GENERAL suggested that it was unwise, whendrawing up a man-power balance sheet,  to budget for a deficit.If the deficit were realised,  it would fall wholly on industry;for the man-power machinery was such that, while the allocations to the Services would be met in full, there could be no suchcertainty that the numbers allotted to industry would be provided.Rather than over-estimate the supply, it would be preferable inhis view to reduce the allocations all round and to budget for a surplus.     He doubted whether the full sxipply of man-powerassumed in these calculations would in practice be forthcoming.At the last man-power review, we had assumed a total supply of1,600,000 during tho eighteen months to the end of 1943.     TheMinister of Labour claimed that 1,130,000 of these had beenobtained up to the end of Marcho      But  of this number 130,000had been supplied to meet expansions in certain essential indus-tries which had not been taken into account la tho crigjxial calculations.To this extent tho supply had not been wholly available for theServices and munitions industries     And there was no certainty that this experience would not be repeated during the second halfof the period,THE LORD PRESIDENT said that,  if the allocations were reduced so that the statistical picture showed a surplus, theresult would be that the Minister of Labour would be withholdingfrom the Services men and women who were available for thoseduties,  without any certainty that they could be placed inemployment in Ministry of Aircraft Production factories or otheress urtial industries.     It might well turn out, at the end ofthe year, that no effective use had been made of tho surplus.A further justification for budgeting for a deficit was that theArmy.o

present calculations were admittedly made on the basisof provisional estimates;   more precise figures wouldbe available shortly,  and a fresh set of calculationswould then be made, as a result of which it might befound that no deficit would in fact mature.THE PRIMS MINISTER thought it would be a mistake   .to suppose that those problems could be solvedpurely by statistical calculations.     This statisticalpresentation of the position should be used merely as a guide on ohe formulation of policy     And hethought that the proposal to budget on.the basis ofa deficit would be of value in stimulating Depart-rnents to exercise their ingenuity in meeting their requirements &quot;with the greatest possible economy inman-powero     Furthermore, the deficit would in fact be met in large part   by a postponement of the elatesby which the full numbers shown in the allocationwere supplied;, rather than by a modification of theprogrammeSoTHE PRIME MINISTER undertook,  in the light ofthe discussion,  to draw up a series of recommendations, which he would submit to theWar Cabinet, to govern the allocation of man-power up till the end of the calendar year 1943.Offices of the War Cabinet, S0W.lc,16th July,  1943.
