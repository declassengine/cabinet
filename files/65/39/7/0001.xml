(43) 101stConclus ions,Minute 4).The War Cabinet had before them thefollowing telegrams:--(i)    Nosu  541 and 342 from President roosevelt to the Prime Minister:(ii)    Nos.  398, 401 and 402 from the PrimeMinister to the President:(iii)    Nos0  1117 and 1118 from the joint staff Mission, Washington.These telegrams dealt with the suggestion(which had been brought to the notice of the _Defence Committee at their Meeting on Monday,s2nd August),  that arrangements should &apos; now be madefor Rome to be declared an open city.      proposals to this effect had been received by the UcSQGovernment    through the Vatican,.      The Presidentin telegram No,  342, stated that he thought thata difficult position would be created if the pleato make Rome an open city were now turned down,,JSM telegram 1118, set out the conditionswhich the UnSc War Department suggested that weshould insist on, before recognising the City of rome as an open city0    These included the removal from Rome of all the agencies concerned in theconduct of th:   war,  and of all armed forces ofItaly or Germany:      The communications system of rome was not to be used for the passage ofmilitary forces, and all use of the airfields in rome and its immediate surroundings was to cease.The War Cabinet was strongly opposed to thesuggestion that we should agree to Rome beingdeclared an open city.    It was pointed out thatthis matter had been carefully considered by theWar Cabinet some seven months earlier.      At thattime the United States Government had not favoured the proposal   and we had also decided against it.Had Rome been declared an open city at thatdate., the removal from the city of the ItalianGovernment would have been a humiliation forMussolini.    On the other hand,  to declare the cityan open city now,  would be regarced as a successfor the Badoglio Government.    It would also seem likely to give rise to an outcry in this  country0ya   D.0.(43) 7th Meeting, Minute 4,-1-W.M. (42) 171Minute 2:  andW.M. (43) 1,Minute 4./
