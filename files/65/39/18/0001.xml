(45) 122ND CONCLUSIONS n , MINUTJP19 o nf i do ntJL .:\1 Annex(3rd September,  1943,  12 Noon),The Vnr Cabinet had hex ore thera the draft ofletter to l,:r.  dc Valera,  prepared -by Mr.  Gray,  theUnited States Minister in Dublin (17, p.(45) 387),This draft had been handed by the President to thePrime hinistor, who had asked that it should beconsidered at once by the 7/ar Cabinet (See telegramWELFARE No,  557).Speaking from the strategical point of view, THEFIRST LORD 0? THE ADMIRALTY said that,   now thatarrangements had been made whereby&apos;,v/o should shortlynave facilities in the Azores, there was  not very muchto be gained, from the Naval point of view,  in gettingbases in Southern Ireland,,THIS CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that,  from theAir point of view,  there would boadvantage in being able to base squadrons on southern ireland,      Not only would this enable our aircraft on patrol- to spend a longer time &apos;over the Bay of Biscay,but it would also enable us to reach a zone outsidethe area in which our aircraft were now subject toharassing, attacks by enemy fighters,,      He did not,however, suggest that the strategical advantagesshould be pressed against substantial -political views.SIR JOHN STEPHENSON said that the dominions office view was that there was much to be said in favourof the despatch of the proposed letter if we could be certain that it would meet with outright rejection.But it seemed more likely that Mr,   de Valera would beable to find passages in the letter on which he couldbase an argument;with which he would seek to drive a wedgebetween British and U.S.   opinion on Irish questions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS referredto a number of detailed points in the letter which hethought would cause some embarrassment.      For example,in one passage it was stated that no protest had beenmade by Southern Ireland when Northern Ireland had boonbombed.      He thought that the people of Northern ireland would have somewhat resented it if a protest had beenmade by Southern Ireland- on this occasion,      Again, hethought that the references to the &quot;open border&quot; betweenSouthern and Northern Ireland would result in questions in Parliament which would be.difficult for him to answer5seeing that he could not state publicly the valuablehelp in espionage matters which wc received from-theSouthern Ireland Government,

9 YjFrom the point of view of public opinion,  hethought that people in this country would not welcome an entry by Southern Ireland into the war at the present stage in order to share the advantages which would accrue to the countries which had taken part in the defeat:f the ,.xis..      Furthermore,  he thought that publicopinion would be resentful if the U. 3.  Government treatedSouthern Ireland as though it were an area of special interest to them.      He also thought that kr,   de Valerawoild reply to the letter by a reference to the partition of Ireland by the United Kingdom Governmentand again would stir up this controversy.      On thewhole,  therefore, while he regarded the draft letteras a brilliant piece of work, he thought that thebalance of advantages was against its despatch.      he felt sure that the Northern Ireland Government wouldbe disturbed by the dispatch of a 1 otter on the lines proposed.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought that public opinion would not welcome the United Statesattempting to get facilities in Southern Ireland which  ;o had not been able to get;    nor ?/ould theyparticularly wish that Southern Ireland, by cominginto the war at this stage, should claim to have achare in the Peace settlement.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that he thought the dispatch of tho letter wouldprobably result in some bitterness between the peopleof the United States and of this country..      Furthermore,from the industrial point of view,  he was veryunwilling that any action should be taken which might cause unrest among the large numbers  of Irish people who were now working in this country, and who at thepresent time felt some bitterness against the peopleof Southern Ireland.THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION drew attentionto the following sentence in paragraph 5:--&quot;While this Government accepts thesuggestion that Your Excellency&apos;sprotest is not made in an, unfriendlyspirit,, but to assert a claim tosovereignty over Northern Ireland ....&quot;He thought that this was a very dangerous sentence,of which use would certainly be made by Mr.   de Valera.VISCOUNT HALIFAX said that the matter must clearlyhie considered from the political point of view, since;he political outweighed the strategic issues.      Hethought the arguments adduced told very strongly againstthe dispatch of the proposed letter.      Whatever answerdo Valera were to give,&quot; he did not see who;    political advantages would ensue from the dispatch of the letter-either to the President in his forthcoming Election,or in strengthening the bonds between the British and american peoples after the war.      The letter itselfconstituted an armoury of arguments, which could always beused if occasion arose, and could probably be used tobetter advantage later on.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXGHEOUER and- THE SECRETARYOF STATE FOR AIR stated that on political grounds theywere a gainst the dispatch of the letter.The &quot;.7ar Cabinet -Invited the Deputy Under Secretary of Statefor Dominions Affairs to prepare a draftt c 1c;p?ara* embo :ly ing . t he p i nt s ma de i nthe discussion, for the Foreign Secretaryto send to the Prime Minister,,      Thedraft should conclude by stating thatthe War Cabinet hoped the President would at least be disposed to postpone thedispatch of the letter until there hadbeen an opportunity for the matter tobe discussed after the Prime Minister&apos; return to this country,.es of the War Cabinet,S.    1.

September, 1943.Following for Prime Ministor from foreign secretary. -Your WELFARE 557 of 2nd. September aboutproposed letter to de Valera. the draft of which wasconsidered by the War Cabinet this morning.The War Cabinet were informed that therewould be considerable advantages in having air bases in Southern Ireland.    Broadly, however, the strategicaladvantages would not, at this stage of the war, appearto be so substantial as to constitute a determining factor..    The matter must therefore be regarded as .mainly a political one.Looked&apos; at from this point of view, the   WarCabinet agreed that the draft letter was well expressedand convincing, although there wore a number of pointsthe wording of which was not happy from our point of view.&apos; We think, however, that public opinion in thiscountry would regard in an unfavourable light any attemptto bring pressure on Southern Ireland to make an eleventhhour entry into   the war, more particularly in response to an American and not a British request.     NorthernIreland, we.feel sure, would take strong exception tosuch an approach.No doubt, if we could be certain that de valera would, refuse the request outright? the despatchof the letter might harden American feeling against him and thus reduce the risk, of American support for post-war Irish demands.     But we think It much more likely that do Valera would make a debating reply and./that the

that the result would be to stir up controversies,e,g. over partition, which would not only prejudiceAnglo-American relations but might also inflame feeling in this country, particularly among the considerable numbers of Southern Irishmen now engaged in vital war production here.     The Minister of Labour attachesgreat importance to this point.Though the American case against southern ireland is very strong, as shown by the draft letter,it is not essential that those arguments should be publicly used now.     Indeed,, we think they could beused with more telling effect later if do Valera hasnot been given the opportunity to reply to them now.Lord Halifax thought that this point would appealespecially to the President.Our representative in Dublin has caJledspecial attention to the danger that, de Valora wouldtake any opportunity of again raising the partitionissue.The above Is a very brief summary of thereasons which led the War Cabinet to tho view thatan approach to de Valera on the lines proposed wouldbe most undesirable at the present stage.     1 do not therefore propose to set out our. detailed points onthe draft letter, since the War Cabinet hope that youwill be able to persuade the President to drop the ideaof sending the letter for themoment.     If, however, heis reluctant to do this, we suggest that you should atany rate ask him to hold up the despatch of the letteruntil your return, when you can go into the wholequestion more fully with the Cabinet.T.O.O. 032030ZCirculation.Deputy Prime Minister.Foreign Secretary.Minister of Labour.Homo Secretary,Lord Halifax.Chancellor of tho Exchequer.First Lord of tho Admiralty.S. of S. for Air.Minister of Aircraft Production.Sir John Stephonson, Dominions office.Sir Edward Bridges,Mr. Pock.Col.

(43)1201Conclusions.Minute 4 ).THE FOREIGN SECRETARY recalled that the views expressed by the War Cabinet on 30th August regardingthe constitution of the politico-military Commissionproposed by Premier Stalin had been communicated tothe Prime Minister in a telegram which he haddespatched on the following day (CONCRETE No.  665).This telegram had in particular expressed the doubtsof the War Cabinet regarding the expediency of adding to the Commission a representative of the french committee of National Liberation.      From telegrams which had since been received from the Prime Minister(WELFARE Nos.   571 and 582V it seemed that the PrimeMinister favoured the inclusion of a french representative and had put this point to PresidentRocsevc.lt, who had not scorned&apos;unsympathetic.      ThePrime Minister was anxious to pursue this proposal.In discussion it was pointed out that the WarCabinet had previously been influenced,  in part, bythe consideration that,  if we proposed the additionof a French representative, the Soviet government might suspect that we were trying to upset the balanceof the Commission to their detriment,      It appeared that this particular apprehension was unfounded;    forPremier Stalin had now indicated that he favoured theaddition of a French representative.      The mainconsideration which the War Cabinet had had in mind,however, was the need for constituting the proposed commission in such a way that it would be a permanentpiece of machinery available to consider armistice&quot;terms, , not only for Italy, but for other powers whichmight dissociate themselves from Germany and possibly,in the end,  for Germany itself.      This was a factor which should he kept prominently in mind in consideringthe composition and location of the proposed Commission,and   also the status of the representatives appointedtoit.      The inclusion of a French representative on such apermanent body might well give  offence to the Governmentsof some European Allies;    and at a later stage might cause difficulties in adapting the Commission to dealwith other countries as well as Italy.The suggestion was mode that a French represerit-ative night be added to the Commission on an ad hocbasis for the purpose only of dealing with the Italiansituation!;    and that the question of the future constitution of a Commission for dealing with countries other than Italy should be left over for discussion atthe forthcoming Anglo-Soviet-American Conference.The War Cabinet -I nv:the Foreign Secretary tPr mie m mistersend a furtbarexplaining intelegramV to thegreater details the views of the War Cabineton this point and putting forward theparticular suggestion outlined at  &apos;X! above.(V3-1-

At their Meeting on 2nd September,  the Y/war cabinet  had asked whether further steps could not betaken to prevent the publication in this country of reports indicating that representatives of the italian and Allied&apos;&quot;Governments had been in touch with a viewto the conclusion of an Armistice.THE DIRECTOR-G-ENERAL OF THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATIONsaid that up to 31st&apos; August he had not been informed ofthe discussions which had been, proceeding withrepresentatives of the Italian Government;    and he hadnot therefore been in a position to give any guidance tothe &quot;Press Censors on this point.      In the last fewweeks there had been a large volume of Press messagesabout the possibility of an Armistice with Italy:    these had seemed for the most part to be based on rumouror speculation,  and many of them were repetitions ofmaterial which had already been published abroad.It would have been impossible to refer all thesemessages to the Foreign Office;    and. without more specific guidance as to the matters in which prematurepublication would be prejudicial,  it would have beenvery difficult for the Press Censors to discriminate between these press messages.      On the 31st August,however.,  when he was told for tho first time about thediscussions which were proceeding,  he had issuedins tract ions that all Press messages which purportedt: describe, discussions; .or terms,  for an armistice with Italy should be referred to the Foreign Office.The YY.r Cabinet, while recognising the difficultiesof the Press Censors,  felt that there was need for a closer liaison in these -matters between the ForeignOffice and the Censorship Division of the Ministry ofI nf or mo. tion.The Y/ar Cabinet -Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrangefor a review of the present arrangementsfor liaison between the Foreign Officeand the Ministry of Information as regardsthe scrutiny of Press messages on mattersof diplomatic importance, with a view to seeing what steps could be taken to improve the present arrangements.ar Cabinet,SAY. 1.

LondonWELFARE NO. 582        3rd September, 1943Prime Minister to Deputy Prime Ministerand Foreign Secretary.1. Not hearing from you I put to the Presidenttoday the idea of the French. National Committee being allowed in on the Anglo-American-Soviet Commission inthe Mediterranean and I showed him my telegram toStalin and Stalin&apos;s favourable reply.    He seemed quiteagreeable&quot;to the idea although questions were raisedabout leakage.&quot;2. My feeling is there will be great advantage in haying four on this Commission.    You must remember that the Americans are arming ten or eleven french divisions which.will certainly bo needed in actionin tho next six or eight months.     I like also youridea of restricting the powers of the Commission.   Itwould be impossible to allow.it to supersede the responsibilities of Governments.     Cadogan is preparing the draft of an answer to Stalin on the Commissionon the basis that the French are in and that it is limited as you propose in your CONCRETE 665.3. I do not see any harm in it beginning in sicily &quot;as you accept-,, but it will be more convenient for it to move to Algiers or Casablanca after it has begun its work.    i would not pross for this Commissionto come to London as wo must keep that for biggergame.4. 1 have also talked to the President aboutthe rendezvous for tho Conference of the three Foreign/Ministers.Unparaphrasod version of a Most SecretCypher Telegram not One Time Table.

 TV.Foroign/Ministers.      Hg is not opposed to a meeting inLondon   but bo is far more favourable to a meeting in Great Britain outside London.     I have myselfsuggested Edinburgh., where perhaps Holyrood might be available,     Anyhow there are other suitableresidences from which the Press can be kept at&apos;a distance.     It is important that the Confbrencoshould not appear to be entirely swamped byLondon .    They would perhaps sit for throe days a week in Edinburgh and come south if they wishedfor tho rest of the time.     I have a feeling theseproposals might also be more acceptable to Stalin.Please let mo know your views at the earliest about it and I will put thorn forward formally to thePresident..5. I see great difficulties In the militarysituation being.discussed at, this Conference,   TheRussians will bring one General who will not beallowed to do anything but bay for a Second Frontimmediately and will express profound dissatisfactionwhen he is told what we intend.     Any discussion ofthese questions should be between the high staffs and the Russian representatives must have the patienceto hear the whole argument put out about the sea,the air. landing cra.it, transportation and the like.Anyhow I should not be prepared to detail a singleBritish General to meet a single American and RussianGeneral as I ami sure that this would very soon peterout into a deadlock.&quot;6. The President discussed with me some ofthe general questions we might put on the Agenda,For instance&quot;; If we win what are we to do withGermany.    Is it to be divided and if so, how.   Nodoubt also the question Maisky posed you aboutwhether there should be spheres of influence orwhether both the Anglo-Americans and the Russiansshould play over the&quot; whole field would bo relevant.I have no doubt what the answer is namely that theRussians and the Anglo Americans: should be entitledto work for their interests in every capital butthe British and Russians having signed a twenty-year treaty would doubtless be always helping eachother.    There would be no question of our dis-interesting ourselves in any part of the world forout of -this might.immediately come tho cause of anew war-.7. In short four or five large Issues should/be proposed

issues should/bo proposed to tho Russians for discussion and theyshould bo invited to suggest others.    There can,however, be no question of such a Conferonce super-scding Cabinet responsibility.    Cadogan is draftinga suggested telegram to Stalin on this point also-which we will send you tomorrow for you to amplify.Meanwhile I shall use this draft as a basis for findingout how far tho United States will go and what theythink.     It may bo that it will be better for us eachto send different drafts rather than to present thoRussians with an agreed plan.     i think matters could easily bo arranged along those lines.8.&apos; Unless something very untoward happens inthe forthcoming battles the Commission should bebrought together as soon as may bo,- i.e. during september,    we also think that the beginning ofOctober Is the latest for the three power Conferenceo.f Foreign Ministers.9.

After my talk with Maisky I have little doubt that Molotov would Toe willing to come to Londonprovided that we could agree in advance with theSoviet Government about the agenda for the meeting.Hull also gave me the impression at Quebec that he did not exclude a visit by himself to London.     Ifhe felt able to come, this would be important initself, as no one in the United States seems tocarry greater weight with the Senate, and hisassociation with any conclusions reached by the  -conference would be a good guarantee of their approval by Congress and public opinion in the UnitedStates.    This would be all the more valuable if oneof tho results of the meeting were the acceptanceof a declaration on the lines of the draft communicatedto us at Quebec engaging the Government of theUnited States to collaborate in the organizationand maintenance of peace and security after the war.Even if Hull could not come to London the UnitedStates Government would bo well represented byWinant.3. It would I presume be out of the question to expect Hull to go to Moscow and I cannot thinkthat Admiral Standley would bo an adequate American/representative.

adequate American/representative.    The President might of coursethink of sending Harry Hopkins and that would bepersonally most agreeable, but I should have thought that Hull&quot;in London would carry moreweight with American opinion than Harry in Moscow.4. It is true that public opinion both here and in the United States is anxious that a throe-power meeting should be held, but it would be a mistake both psychologically and politically forthe United States Government and ourselves to showtoo much eagerness to go to Moscow.    Moreover,Stalin would probably be still at the front whenthe conference took place and we should-be told. -he could not come to Moscow.    Such an anti-climaxwould be avoided if London were chosen as half-wayhouse between Washington and Moscow.T.0.0. 021210Z.(Circulation)Deputy Prime Minister.Foreign Secretary.Mr, Pock,Captain Clifford.
