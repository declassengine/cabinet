(Previous Reference: W.M.(43) 125th Conclusions.

The War Cabinet met at very short notice to consider the following telegram (NAF 365) received from General Smith, at General Eisenhower&apos;s Headquarters at Algiers:-

"The cipher message following has just been received:

&apos;Owing to changes in the situation which has broken down and the existence of German forces in the Rome area, it is no longer possible to accept immediate Armistice since this proves that the Capital would be occupied and the government taken over forcibly by the Germans. Operation GIANT TWO no longer possible because of lack of forces to guarantee airfields. General Taylor ready to return to Sicily, to present views of the government and awaits orders. Communicate means and location you prefer for his return.

(Sgd) BADOGLIO.&apos;

Commander-in-Chief is now in conference with commanders at Advance Command Post and has this information.       Decisions taken will be communicated to you at the earliest possible moment. They probably will be to call off GIANT TWO (this is inevitable) and to go ahead with all other plans.

Question of whether announcement of Armistice should be made as originally scheduled is most important. It might have great effect on Italian resistance and, after all, we have the signed document which was completed  in good faith by an authorised representative of the man who now retracts.

It is possible but non-probable that Ambrosia will leave Rome and go ahead with the original plan for some other location. In any case, we would like to have at the earliest possible moment your thought on whether or not we should proceed with the Armistice announcement for the tactical and deception value it might have. Certainly the Italian Government itself deserves no consideration."

The opinion of the War Cabinet and of the Chiefs of Staff was in favour of the announcement of the Armistice in the course of the afternoon or evening, since this might weaken Italian resistance and help operation  AVALANCHE, which was due to take place early on the following morning.

A short telegram was accordingly drafted, to the effect that the War Cabinet and Chiefs of Staff favoured the announcement of the Armistice before Operation AVALANCHE, but would leave the timing of the announcement to General Eisenhower.



Before,  however, this telegram could be despatched, a further telegram (NAF 387) was received from General Eisenhower in the following terms:-

"I have just completed a conference with the principal Commanders and have determined not to accept the Italian change of attitude. We intend to proceed in accordance with plan for the announcement of the Armistice and with subsequent propaganda and other measures.

Marshal Badoglio is being informed through our direct link that this instrument entered into by his accredited representative with presumed good faith on both sides is considered valid and binding and that we will not recognise any deviation from our original agreement."

The War Cabinet agreed with the conclusion reached by General Eisenhower, and asked that a short telegram should be sent to the Combined Chiefs of Staffs, (and repeated to General Eisenhower), to the effect that they and the Chiefs of Staff entirely agreed with his decision. [See O.Z.27l3].

Reference was also made to telegram NAF 364 from General Eisenhower to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. This contained the text of two statements which it was proposed should be given to newspaper correspondents at  Algiers that evening.

The War Cabinet thought that the following words in the second statement were open to objection:-

"That the Armistice did not necessarily imply recognition of any Italian Government, far less acceptance of Italy as an ally or even as a collaborator".

The War Cabinet asked that a telegram should be sent to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, and repeated to General Eisenhower, to the effect that, in view of the new developments, they thought it better that no comments whatsoever should be made to Press correspondents in Algiers and elsewhere until it could be seen how the situation developed.

The attention of the War Cabinet was also drawn to the fact that the statement which the President and the Prime Minister proposed to make when giving out the text of General Eisenhower&apos;s announcement of the signature of the Armistice also contained the phrase quoted above WELAFARE 658.

The War Cabinet endorsed the view of the Foreign Secretary that it would be an advantage if this phrase were  emitted from the statement.
