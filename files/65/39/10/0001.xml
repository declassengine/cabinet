MINUTE 2Conf idential Annex11th August, 1943,  11,30 a.ra.The War Cabinet were reminded that theattitude of the Russian Government had been difficult for some weeks past;    and that no response had beenreceived from Premier Stalin to the suggestions which had been made some time ago for a meeting between himself,  the Prime Minister and president roosevelt.      Before his departure for Canada,  thePrime Minister had settled the terms of a message to be sent to Premier Stalin as soon as securityconsiderations allowed, informing him of theproposed conference with President Roosevelt and suggesting that an early opportunity should be taken of holding a further meeting at which Premier Stalincould be present.    This message had been despatchedon 7th August4A reply had been received from Premier Stalinon the previous day,  which had been transmitted tothe Prime Minister in telegram CONCRETE No.  81?Premier Stalin agreed that a meeting of the Heads ofthe three Governments was desirable and should bearranged at the first opportunity.    The militarysituation on the Eastern Front was, however,  such that it would not be possible for him to leaveRussia at the present time for such a meeting.    he therefore suggested that,  in order to avoid postponingexamination of the questions of interest to the three countries    there should be an early meeting of the responsible representatives of the three States.    Hesuggested that the place and date of such a meeting should be fixed in the near future;    and that thescope of the questions to be discussed and the drafts of the proposals to be made should beagreed beforehand.The telegram concluded with a message of congratulation on the successful operations in Sicily.THE FOREIGN  SECRETARY said that,   inforwarding this to the Prime minister he had suggested (in Telegram CONCRETE No,  85J that weshould send an immediate reply agreeing in principle-to the meeting proposed,  and indicating that time,place, personnel and agenda should be settled later,It also suggested that the Prime Minister should send to Premier Stalin a message of congratulationabout   the capture of Orel.In discussion,   general -satisfaction was expressed with the tone and content of premier stalin&apos;s message.

Such a meetingmust be realised at the first opportunity, havingarranged with the President the place and the time of thismeeting.At the same time I ought to say that in theexisting situation on the Soviet-German front I  to myregret, have no opportunity to absent myself ana to leavethe front even for one week.   Although recently we havehad severs,! successes on the front,, an extreme strain on   .the strength and exceptional watchfulness are required in;regard to tho now possible actions of the enemy from theSoviet troops and from the Soviet Command just now.   Inconnection with, this l havo to visit the troops on that&apos; orother parts of our front more often than usual.   In thecircumstances at the present time I am not able to visitScapa Flow or any other distant point for a meeting with you and the President./Nevertheless

Nevertheless in order not to postpone an examination of the questions which interest ourcountries, it would be expedient to organize a meetingof the responsible representatives of our States, andwe might come to an understanding in the nearest futureconcerning the place and date of such a meeting.Moreover, it is necessary beforehand to agree on the scope of the questions to be discussed and the drafts of the proposals which have to be accepted.The meeting will hardly give any tangible resultwithout that.(2)   Talcing this opportunity I congratulatethe&apos; British Government and the Anglo-American troops on the occasion of their most successful operations in sicily which have already caused the downfall of mussolini and the break-up of his gang0ENDS.T.0.0. 101S35Z.Circulation.Deputy.

U-^.Cfr^........MOST SECRET. Copy NoJ.*L...W..M. (45)  114th CONCLUSIONS.   MINUTE confidential Annex(11th August,  1943,  11.30 a.m.)ITALY(previous reference:W.M. (43) 113 th conclusions,Minute 2).THE FOREIGN SECRETARY informed the War cabinet of the latest position about the approaches which hadbeen received, purporting to come from the ItalianGovernment.The chief of these approaches had been madeby Signor Berio, Counsellor of Embassy in the ItalianMinistry of Foreign Affairs,  to the Acting british consul-General at Tangier.    (Mr.  Gascoigne was atpresent on leto Tangier),been sent onBritishour Mission atytheCONCRETE No.  20).ave in Madrid, but was shortly returningSignor Berio   had stated that he hada special mission to negotiate withrepresentatives,  since negotiations through&quot;Vatican were impracticable    (seeThe Foreign Secretary mentioned thata on roaches had been made:-two other(a)    In Lisbon by Marquisf T-* ^        T v-i    &quot;Do Tin       nv. n       ViTr   Q-! rv&apos;d&apos;Aieta, and(b) In Barcelona, by Signor Busseti, who claimed to be the bearer of a formal communication on behalf of a number of Italian Parties.It was not, however, felt that either of thesetwo approaches was deserving of consideration,  at anyrote at this stage.Information as to Signor Berio&apos;s approachhad been communicated to the Prime Minister(CONCRETE No. 21).    In this telegram it waspointed out that there could be no question of anynegotiation.    On the other hand, as we believed this to be an official approach from the Badoglio Government,the Foreign Secretary thought that it v/ould be difficultto justify ignoring it altogetherDIt was therefore suggested that our reply shouldbe on the following lines:-(a)    Since, as was well known, we insisted onunconditional surrender,  the BadoglioGovernment must,  as a. first step,  notifyus that Italy surrendered unconditionally.(b)    Subsequently, at a later stage,  if theBadoglio Government were willing to do this,we should inform them of the terms on whichwe were prepared to cease hostilitiesagainst Italy.-1-

In a later telegram to the Prime Minister(GONGgETE No......54;-  the Foreign Secretary had againemphasised the need for insisting expressly onunconditional surrender before we named our terms.The Prime Minister had replied (WELFARE No,  22)suggesting that he would prefer the following Wording:-&quot;Badoglio must state that he is prepared toplace himself unreservedly in the hands ofthe Allied Governments,  who have already made it plain that they desire Italy to have arespectable place in the new Europe,!0The Prime Minister suggested -chat reference should also he made to General Eisenhower&apos;s offer ofthe return of Italian prisoners    of war taken in tunisia and Sicily, providing Allied prisoners arespeedily set free.    The object of this was to convey to the Italian Government the feeling that, while theyhad to make surrender a formal act of submission,  our desire was to treat them with consideration so far as military exigencies allowed^,The Foreign Secretary had replied to this telegram as follows,  in OONGRETE No,.  64ft -&quot;I quite understand your wish to sweeten thepill for the Badoglio Government, but Badogliohaving asked to  &apos;negotiate&apos;  I feel that afterstating so categorically in public that weinsist on Unconditional surrender&apos; we are bound to tell Badoglio&apos;s emissary that we still require this.    In order to make  this as palatable as possible I suggest somethingon the foil, wing lines:-&apos;Badoglio must understand that we cannotnegotiate but require unconditional surrender, which means that the ItalianGovernment should place themselves in thehands of the Allied Governments, who will then state their terms.    These willprovide for an honourable capitulation, 1Badoglio&apos;s emissary should be Reminded at thesame time that you and President have already-stated that we desire that in duo courseItaly should occupy a respected place in theNew Europe when peace has been re-established,and that General Eisenho-wer has announced that italian prisoners taken in Tunisia and Sicilywill be released provided all British and allied prisoners now in Italian hands are released,,2.      I think this draft reply gives the Italiansthe maximum hone without providing them withany opening to entice us first into explanationand then into argument,  which is what I am surethey will try hard to do,3.      I am not repeating this to the President,but no doubt you&quot; will be concerting a replywith him and will let me know what you think&quot;.

In discussion the War Cabinet expressed general agreement with the lino proposed by theForeign Secretary.    In particular,  it was felt that itwas essential that we should continue to use the phrase&quot;unconditional surrender&quot;,  which we had already used.Some doxibts were expressed as to whether this approach was sufficiently substantial to justify a formal reply.    It was generally felt, however.;  thatan approach on these lines was what might be expectedat this stage from the Italian Government, which would seek to entangle us in negotiations,  and that therewas advantage in giving a reply which repeated theposition we had already taken up0The War Cabinet:-Took note with approval of the line ofaction proposed by the Foreign Secretary.THE MINISTER RESIDENT AT ALLIED headquarters in NORTH WEST AFRICA then raised the  question whether,if the Chief of Staff or Commander-in-Chief italian forces , at the end of a battle in which the Axis forces had been defeated,  came to General Eisenhower&apos;s or general Alexander&apos;s headquarters ; the same procedure should be adopted, namely, that we should insist uponunconditional surrender before showing terms of surrender.The War Cabinet agreed that this course was essential,, since otherwise there was a grave risk thatwe should get drawn into negotiations.    The proceduremust therefore be that any Italian Commander must first of all surrender unconditionally or place himself in the hands of the Allied Commander.      He would then be shown terras and called upon to sign them.The Italian Commander might raise questions about the terms.    If so, the position was that theterms drawn up covered all essential points, and thatthe Allied Commander had no discretion to vary them.If any question of the interpretation of the terms was raised,  the Allied Commander-in-Chief should say thatthis point could be taken up when the terms had been .signed.    Any points outside the terms of surrender wouldprima facie not be points of first importance;  and theCommander-in-Chief should accordingly have discretion to deal with them as he thought right, e. g.  questions connected with the honours of war and so forth.The above, of course,  related to the conclusionof an armistice on behalf of the Italian Government.The Commander-in-Chief already had instructions -which dealt with partial surrenders. o-..go by a Commander of theforces in any particular area.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W. 1.

Following is repetition of Tangier telegram 405 reportingthis approach.BEGINS:-&quot;Signer&apos;Berio, Counsellor of Embassy at present employed inthe Italian Ministry,of Foreign Affairs&apos;, arrived to-day fromRome which he left yesterday.     He states that he was &quot;instructed by Marshal Badoglio on the advice of his son, Mario;,Badoglio,Italian Consul General at Tangier, to establish contact withMr. Gascoigne In Tangier in order to discuss possiblenegotiations with the present Italian Government.-2-i-    a similar emissary Marquis -&quot;Lanza. dtAieta, former Chef deCabinet of Ciano, has gone to-Lisbon with a similar mission to.the British or American representative.3.    I was informed during the course of the evening that amember of the Italian -Consulate General wished to see me urgentlyand I agreed with --him to meet the Italian Vice Consul and to accompany him to&quot;.the house, of the Italian Charge d&apos; Affaires,where tt met Signer Berio.4.   Berio states that he has been sent on a special missionby Marshal Badoglio as negotiations through our &quot;mission at the vatican are impracticable.     As a cover-for this he is toassume charge temporarily of the Italian Consulate General here.5.   He is instructed to request me. to inform you that MarshalBadoglio. Is ready to treat &quot;with His Majesty1 s&quot; Government but isquite&apos; unable to do &apos;so openly at present being entirely underthe control of the Germans,.     ,In a few days he will have aconference with Hitler or other German representative and undercompulsion will issue .a further, proclamation that the war willcontinue and that alliance with: Germany cannot be broken.     Theseare of course not his real.sentiments or those of the&quot;ItalianGovernment or the people, but lib is necessary to g^ih time.6.    It is most urgently necessary to help Badoglio to stay inPiower anu.to assist him to maintain internal order.     ShouldBadoglio fall the Germans will, seize Rome - armoured divisions are in waiting for this purpose&apos;- and will&apos;form.a military government, under a Quisling. f   ,

He does- not at presentpropose to establish contact with the American Legation here.9.    lie hopes that a reply may be received at the earliestpossible moment for communication to Marshal Badoglio.10- According to Signor Berio most of the Italian troops, havebeen recalled from France and none from Albania or Greece./&quot;Signer.

I told him that he must first establish hisbona fides and disclose his business.     He then stated thatnig name was Pierino Busseti, had spent most of his time in spain since 1939, address being Velasquez 71 Madrid, that hewas engaged in business, had gone to Rome of June 9th and had returned by aeroplane on.

HUSH - MOST SECRET &apos;   OUT3 -2*   This communication, which is In the form&apos;, of. a manifesto,arid which the bearer had memoris (?group omitted.fed) before leaving Rome and then wrote down here, states that theCommittee is of the opinion that the Government of MarshalBadoglio does not&quot;express the present wishes and desires of theItalian people;    that this Government is attempting to makecompromise peace which is foredoomed to failure;    and thatthe re-institution of repressive measures on the Pacist modelmakes it impossible for the Italian people to regain their freedom without having assistance from outside by the united nations.     This Committee, representing as they do all shades of political opinion in Italy and (sic. ? are) confident thatthe recent declaration of His Majesty&apos;s Government and theUnited States Government still hold (? group omittedj ?s)good and propose to His Majesty&apos;s Government, who would dulycommunicate with the Governments of the Allied Nations, that recognition be given to the Committee as their Allies in the fight against Fascism and Nazism.     If this recognition isgiven the Committee affirms its intention of&quot;taking allpossible measures against the Germans who occupy Italy and ofacting in concert with the Allies to this end..    TheCommittee considers itself a form of provisional governmentand hopes to concert concrete measures with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.3.    Communication ends by stating that the bearer is theiraccredited representative ana that he has been instructedto remain in Spain for the purpose of taking back to Italyany answer you may think fit to give.\4.    Translation by next bag,5,    Please see my immediately following telegram. &quot;33nds.Begins:- &quot;No.257.My immediately preceding telegram.Bearer of communication requested that his name andmission be treated with the utmost secrecy.2.      In the ceurse of conversation he volunteered thestatement that the Italian Communist Party had attempted tojoin this committee of Action but had been more or less coldshouldered, that if the present situation dragged on much longer, conditions in Italy wjuII become chaotic and gravedisorder would ensue, but that the Italian army was stillrespected by the mass of the population which had not beenthe case in 1921 and 1922.     He mentioned that Mussolini wasunder surveillance in the Fort of Boccea near Rome.2.  (sic).    He also stated that for reasons of safety, theCommittee had made no attempt to make contact through HisMajesty&apos;a Minister at the Vatican.3.    He will remain here until further notice.4.   The general impression which I derived from this conversation was that this so-called Committee of Action was prepared to turn out the Badoglio Government and to instigatethe army to turn against the Germans, but was powerless to act,and perhaps too frightened to act without the active supportof the armed forces of the Allies on the mainland of Italy./At ...
At the back of his mind was perhaps the fear that &quot;honourcapitulation&quot; with the possibility of lenient treatmentlonger held good in view of the (? grp.omtd.. ? failure of)the Badoglio Government &quot;to surrender promptly, mixed withhope that the Committee, if it. obtained, recognition&apos;andsupoort from the Allies, would succeed where Badoglio had failed,&quot;, ...Ends.5.

Berio is an Italian professional diplomat. Sir P..Loraine just remembers meeting him as Counsellor of theItalian Embassy .at Angora.    Member of my department: recalls,him as an unassuming pleasant little man.3;     Be^rio&apos;s app.roach is substantially the same as d&apos;Aieta&apos;s,though more definite.   We are entitled -to regard it as an offer by. the Badoglio Government to negotiate on terms...4.     There can of course be no question of any negotiation.On the other hand, we believe this is an official approachfrom the Badoglio Government, and I think It might be,difficult to justify ignoring it altogether. ,..-v&apos;4-   r..5,   : -Should we not then reply that, as is well known, weinsist on unconditional surrender and the Badoglio government must as a&apos; first step notify us that Italy surrendersunconditionally.6.      Subsequently, at a later stage, if the   BadoglioGovernment were to do this, we should then inform them of the terms on which we should be prepared to ceasehostilities against Italy. &apos;7 k     Following are my comments on Barcelona telegrams Nos. -256 and 257.    .8.     Busseti is unknown to us.    Though we had not heard that political parties mentioned had formed themselves intoa committee of -action* we think this quite credible.Further enquiries are being made.   But we doubt whetherCommittee of Action, hastily formed out of Liberal groups which have been suppressed for the past twnnty years andexcluding Communists and.apparently other Left grougs suchas Partite d*Azione, can represent a serious politicalforce.. Committee makes no claim to speak for the italian army,whor, so far as we know,, are still loyal to Badoglioand are perhaps the most powerful factor in the country.Cent. 9.
9.     We conclude that qommitteVs v%.e$M to be able&apos;&apos;&apos;to turn out the; Badogiio Government and Instigatethe Army&apos;to turn against the Germans-should be discounted.   I therefore consider thbt if wouldnot be in our interests to recognise this groupas a provisional governments   Moreover, if we areto try out Badoglio on lines of paragraph 5 above,we do not, at present at He ast,i wish: to-supportany opposition against hii&amp;.10.   At the same time, Committee of Action maybe useful, to us hereafter slxice-they apparentlyrepresent moderate opinion which might eventuallycome into its own.    They should therefore not be -&apos;discouraged.    Busseti might he told that Committee&apos;communication has; been considered, that withoutfurther assurance that they are in a position toreplace existing Government we cannot enter into,any undertakings-with them, bub that in any casethe first step must be -for Italy to surrender*Meanwhile, the best advice we can give is thatall patriots should turn&quot; their efforts towards,bringing about   that surrender and- frustrating Germandesigns on Italy.11.

HUSH MOST SECRET MESSAGE     0022373 August out to: r DATEs 8.3.43FROM: Admiralty.IMMEDIATECONCRETE No.55,Following for Prime Minister from foreign secretary.Following is repetition of Tangier Tel.408..Begins.    My Tel.405 CONCRETE 20vI had further conversation with Signer Berioat his request.     Signer Castronuovo was present.    I told him that I had received no reply to my telegram sent on August 6th at 4.30 a.m. after our previous talkand I asked him whether he had any further instructions from Rome.   He said that he had not and that he supposedthat his Government was waiting for e reply from London,through this or some other channel, indicating whether his Majesty&apos;s Government wishes to initiate some sort of negotiation.2.       Signer Berio produced Tangier Gazette (Frenchedition) of August 7th and he showed me an article headed&quot;La Guerre continue&quot;.     He asked whether this articlecould be considered to be a reply to his demarche.   I told him that from the time of publication and from itslanguage, it was quite clear to me that it was not.   he asked whether such an article was officially inspiredand I replied that, without giving away secrets, he could&quot;be assured that it was based on a telegram received from london but it might be an editorial from the London press and not officially inspired but approved for publicationhere.3. He then asked me to allow him to go throughthe article paragraph by paragraph and to forward hiscomments to the Foreign Office if I thought fit,4.       Paragraph 2 reads &quot;The new Italian Governmenthas sent no official communication to the Allies in replyto the speeches pronounced by Churchill, and president roosevelt, nor to the warnings given by radio to theItalian people In the name of General Eisenhower.&quot;   SignorBerio said that an official communication by speech orwireless would be impossible owing to the immediate effectit would   have on the Germans, but that his communication to me on Thursday was Intended to be official.

errPlease repeat this telegram to Lisbon if you think fit as an unnumbered telegram from me.Ends.I am informing the President through Halifax.For comments see my immediately following Tel.082237BDeputy Prime minister foreign secretary mr. PeckCaptain Clifford5. Paragraph 4 reads &quot;It is difficult to understand what Badoglio hopes to gain by his policy oftemporisation,&quot;   Signer Berio replied to this that marshall 3.1s temporising with the Germans and not with us*   He has decided to make peace but what can he dountil we say what we want.6. In paragraph 5 it is stated &quot;It is asked why he delays so long in accepting the terms proposed bythe Allies.&quot;   What are these terms? asked Signor Berio,7. Paragraph 6 reads &quot;The only conclusion whichthe Allies can draw from the policy at present adoptedby Badoglio is that he and his government have decidedto help the Germans,&quot;   This is absolutely denied.Why should they do so?   Surely the complete suppression of the Fascist party shows that Marshal Badoglio1sGovernment is not prepared to help the Germans any morethan it is compelled to do by circumstances.   Badogliois doing all he can to establish a channel for negotiation with the Allies.    If he continues to givelip service to the Germans that is merely eye-wash fortheir consumption and he is giving them no physicalhelp of any kind and is encouraging every obstruction.8. Signor Berio asked&apos;     to give my personal opinon as to what further reply B(adoglio) could give pendingreceipt of news of the reaction in London to his message.I, said that we must wait but that I thought he mightstate definitely that he is prepared to place himselfunreservedly in the hands of the Allies Commander-in-Chieftrusting in the honourable conditions which have been promised by Eisenhower and by Churchill and that he therefore begs to be informed as to what the terms are.9. Signor 3erio then asked me what I thought was likely to be the nature of those terms and whether theywould include any decision about colonies.   I repliedthat I did not know and that I must await instructionsbefore having such discussions.10. He finally said that he knew that much harmhad been done to us by the Fascist Government but thatit was the work of one man who had now gone.    I said thatthe one man was apparently supported by the majority ofhis countrymen for a very long time and that the evilthey had done could not be put right by a stroke of thepen nor by the mere      ^ouncement that Mussolini had been replaced and his party dissolved.   We parted on veryfriendly terms.I do not propose    to have any . .    ther discussions with the Italians until I receive   your instructions.

You will see that Acting Consul-general in speaking to Berio has already on his own authorityused similar language when he said that he thoughtthat if Badoglio wished to make any further move itmust be to state definitely that he was prepared toplace himself unreservedly in the hands of the AlliedGovernments.2. May I now send reply as suggested above inmy telegram CONCRETE No.21?   I am sure we should insistexpressly on unconditional surrender before we nameour terms.   Apart  vom our public declarations anyother course would inevitably involve us in long andtortuous negotiations.3* I am repeating the foregoing to the President.082240BDeputy Prime minister foreign secretary mr.

The wording I should prefer would he:    Begins:Badoglio must state that he is prepared to place himself unreservedly in the hands of the AlliedGovernments who have already made it plain that they desire Italy to have a respectable place in the newEurope,    Ends,,Reference should also La made  bo General Eisenhower&apos;s offer of the return of Italian prisoners of war taken in Tunisiaand Sicily, providing allied prisoners are speedily set free.2. Tht. object of the above is to convey to the ItalianGovernment the feeling that, while they have to makesurrender formal act of submission, our desire is to treatthem with consideration so far as military exigencies allow.Mere harping on &quot;uriconditional surrender&quot; with no prospects of mercy held cut even as act of grace may well lead tono surrender at alii      The expression &quot;honourable capitulation&quot;has also been officially used by the President and I do notthink it should be omitted from the language (?we are) nowto use.3.

Unparaphrased version of a Most Secret Cypher Telegramnot&apos; One Time TableCONCRETE NO. 84TOO 102012ZTOD 102100ZMOST SECRET CYPHER TELEGRAMIMMEDIATE       -From:-      Air ministry to:-      - QuadrantCONCRETE No. 84    10th. August, 1943.Following for Prime Minister from foreign secretary.    Most Secret and personal.Reference WELFARE No. 22.I   I quite understand your wish to sweeten thepill for&quot;the Badoglio Government, but Badoglio havingasked to &quot;negotiate&quot; I feel that after stating socategorically in public that we insist on &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; we are bound to tell Badogliots emissarythat we still require this.     In order to make this aspalatable as possible I suggest something on thefollowing lines&quot;Badoglio must understand that we cannotnegotiate but require unconditional surrender, which means that the Italian Government should place themselvesin the hands of the Allied Governments, who will thenstate their terms.    These will provide for an honourablecapitulation.&quot;Badoglio?s emissary should be reminded at the -same time that you and President have already statedthat we desire that in due course Italy should occupya respected place in the New Europe when peace has been -re-established, and that General Eisenhower has announcedthat Italian prisoners taken in Tunisia and Sicilywill be released provided all British and Allied prisonersnow in Italian hands are released.2. I think this draft reply gives the Italiansthe maximum hope without providing them with anyopening to entice us first into explanation and then/into argument,

-2-into argument, which is what I am sure they will try-hard to do.3. I am not repeating this to the President,but no doubt you will be concerting a reply withhim and will let me know what you think.Q4, No other important developments on the diplomatic front to-day.T.O.O.-   102012ZCirculation,&quot;Deputy Prime Minister,Foreign Secretary.Mr. Peck.Captain Clifford.
