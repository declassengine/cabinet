Tho War Cabinet hod before them the following telegrams:-(Previous WIULFiJffi No. 402 embodying Marshal Stalin&apos;s reply[Reference: to tho message sent to him on 19th ioigust (WEI^ARE-i.M.(43) 116th No 217) from the Prime Minister and the PresidentConclusions.) of tho United States on the subject of thenegotiations with Italy.CONCRETE Nos. 557 and 558, repeating Moscowtelegrams Nos. 803 and 806 commenting on theproposal mado in Marshal Stalin&apos;s reply.Marshal Stalin suggested in his message the immediateestablishment of a politico-military Commission consisting ofrepresentatives of Groat Britain, the United States and theU.S.S.R., for tho purpose of considering all questions con-cerning tho tarns of surrender to bo imposed on Italy andother countries which might dissociate themselves from Germany.He suggested that hitherto the U.K. and U.S. Governments hadacted in consultation in those matters and had done no morethan inform tho Soviet Government of their conclusions.    Hodid not dosiro this situation to continue.    He therefore asked that tho proposed Commission should be set up at onco, and suggested that it should operate in the first Instance in sicily.THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that the Foreign Office favoured the acceptanceof this proposals-The War Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of staff would raiso n   objection, if it were clear that the appoint-raent of such a Commission would not delay the execution ofmilitary operations already planned.     The War Cabinet took the view that tho appointment of the Commission need not involve any such delay, and that it would not be allowed to function in such a way as to impede military operations.It appeared to bo contemplated that this commission would continue as a standing body, and the question was raised whether it would not be more appropriately located in thiscountry than in Sicily.     On the other hand, it seemed thatthe Commission was to be primarily a military body, and thorewas no reason why it should not function in Sicily, in thefirst instance.     This would havo the advantage that thoRussians would thereby be publicly associated with theM g di terrene r. n c amp a i gn .In his telegram Marshal Stalin had made it a matter of complaint that the message sent him by the Prime Minister andC\, tho President had reached him in an incomplete form;    and hesuggested on this account that he had not been fully informed of the negotiations with Italy.The War Cabinet wore informed that, in consequence-of errors in transmission, tho message had reachod moscow in an incomplete stato.       It was most unfortunate that thesemistakes should have occurred;    but, as soon as they had been

discovered, imraediate     stops had been taken to remedy thorn and Marshal Stalin had by now receivedthe full text of the message.The War Cabinet -(l) agreed to recommend the Prime Ministerand the President of the ^United states to accept Marshal Stalin1s proposal forthe appointment of an Anglo-Soviot-Amoricah Commission to examine theterms of surrender for Italy and othercountries dissociating themselves fromGermanyo(2) Invited the Deputy Prime Minister toinform tho Prime Minister of the WarCabinet&apos;s views on this proposal.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,if See Telegram CONCRETE No.  570of 2oth August,  1943.
