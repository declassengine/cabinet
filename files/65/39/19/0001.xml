The Wor Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows-:-.(l) The &quot;-Foreign Secretary was invited to send atele gram to the Prime Minister on thefollowing linos:-(a) We thought it unlikely that the germans would use gas against the Italians.(b) Nevertheless wo thought that thebalance of advantage lay in giving a warning to the Germans,  as soonas the Armistice with Italy had been announced,  that if they used gasagainst Italy we should retaliate.(c) Before this warning was given,  however,it would be desirable that theRussian Government should be consulted,  since the outbreak of gaswarfare would probably be to the disadvantage of the Russian offensive.(d) In view of tho fact that canadian troops were engaged in South Italy,Mr&apos;. MaeRonzio King should be told that we proposed to issue thiswarning,  and it should be left tohim to suggest that the canadian government should be associated withthe declaration,  if he so desired,,(2) The   -ther Dominion Governments should notbe informed at this stage,  but should beinformed of the warning shortly before itwas issued,      l   ,   ;Offices of the War Cabinet,

Following Military information receivedfrom General Z.    Information dated up to 24 August.&quot;2. Gorman order of battle in Italy, -(a). Following Divisions in Genoa-Livorno area,.305 Infantry, 94 Infantry, 76 Infantry,- 65 Infantrywith 44 Infantry moving down from Norm.Comment, 65 Infantry Division may be error for71 as General Z first gave number as 61. ^ previous report from General C gave 55 (probably 65) inRavenna area. Seems probable however that both 71and 65 Divisions are in Italy though exact locationunknown.&apos; All wore good Divisions partly motorisedbut not all up to strength.(b). One SS Division (probably Adolph Hitler)/and 21

Adolph Hitler/and 21 Panzer Division in Roggio Noll Emilia area,SS Division Rolen was moving into same area fromGermany.    Divisions wore up to strength.Comment.   21 Panzor Division may bo a mistakefor 24 panzer Division but General Z was emphaticthat number was 21. ,(c).   Throe Panzer Grenadier Division and TwoFlieger Division respectively North and South of Rome.Former had attached troops which made it equivalent of Vk Divisions and had some 50 to 60 tanks.    TwoFlieger Division had boon reinforced by some tanks and heavy artillery.    Those Divisions constitutedthe German throat to Rome and were not believed tohave any Coastal defence roles.    Divisions werehinged onto 5th Italian Army but in reality wereKesselring&apos;s body guard and would act under his orders.(d).   15 Panzer Grenadier, Hermann Goering and16 Panzer Divisions wore located in area Gaeta-Naples-Salerno.     26 Panzer Division was in Castrovillari-Catanzaro area a;nd 29 Panzor Grenadier Division inToe.    One Flieger Division was practically nonexistent.     16 and 26 Panzer Divisions were excellentDivisions a,nd must be presumed up to strength.   On24 August the 3 Divisions in Sicily were equivalent in strength to 1 good Division.     15 Panzer Grenadierand Hermann Goering Division had very few tanks.All 3 Divisions were being reformed with troops whichwere moving South through &quot;Rome    This traffic howeverseemed to be -greater than that needed to bring Divisionsup to strength.Comment.   One Flieger Division Is believed to be stronger than thought by General Z and we estimate it to be equivalent of 5 to 6 Battalions.(e).     General Z stated of 16 Divisions atpresent In Italy, 12 were up to strength and although some Divisions lacked various types of equipment theforce as a whole was up to strength.3. German Strategy.(a)      Germany&apos;s first task is directed towardsbuilding up her forces in the North and making the/lino Genoa-Rimini

making the/lino Genoa-Rimini firm.     when General Z loft on25 August, Germans were considering a move forward to line of River ,.rno.     As their forces becomestronger they would then move further South to theline Grosseto-Amlata-perugif-Ancona.     This provided a strong line with tho high ground on either sideof Lake Trasimcno.     It was oven possible they wouldpush forward to a lino Gaota-Xsornio-Vasta on which some fortifications wore already being prepared.These moves were dependent on Allies,&quot;   If we showedstrength, Germans would remain in North and withdrawslowly their forces in South.     If Allies revealedweakness Germans would fight in South.(b).     All linos vfore naturally strong wherecommunications Northwards could be easily blockedand whore hilly terrain necessitated tho employmentof specially trained Infantry. f(c).     Germany has disposed her forces in locksin areas where landings were likely to take placei.e. Gonoa-Spozia, Gacta-Naplcs-Salorno and Calabria.Id). Finally Gormanv would do everything in her power to keep the Allies as far from her&apos;vitals as possible4. Command of Forces.(a).     In theory Gorman Troops wore under GeneralRoatta as Chief of Italian Army staff but in practice the observation intervened whenever thoy saw fit and Germanscarried on as they desired.(b).    Rommel commands German Troops in theNorth and those in South care under 10 Army,     Italiansrefused to allow thoir 4 and 8 Armies to be undercommand of Rommel.     Germans have asked that Rommelshould ta^cc over German and Italian sectors as hoadvances,5. Italian Formations,General Z was not very forthcoming ooh-cerning Italian order of battle.    Ho said a 2ndInfantry Division is to be moved Into Heel of Italy.Ho was uncertain regarding the movements of 4th/Army from

of 4th/Army from Franco but thought that 2 or 3 Divisionsmight remain in Franco.    Italian dispositions wereespecially strong on tho French and Jugoslav bordersand at Rome.     One Division.  wa,s being&apos;moved toSpozia and possibly a second might go there.    BetweenSpezia and Rome, forces were very weak.6. Italian policy regarding Rome.Rome would be dofended at all costs ifGermans tried to take control.     For this purpose5 to 6 Italian Divisions -wore disposed round Rome.No orders to this effect had gone out in writing butsoldiers understood what was required of thorn oversince fell of Mussolini.7, Gorman-Russian Armistice.General Z dwelt at some length on this and is convinced that Hitler rather than surrenderwould throw himself onto Russie,n mercy.    Z is convinced that Gorman strategic moves arc made withview to gaining time for a. Russian rapprochement sothat Germany can turn her attention to West.8. Use of Gas,Italians arc nervous that Germany will usegas against them.    As General Z pointed out hitler had once said gas was meant for traitors.    he therefore urged- that in event of Italian surrender,we should inform Germans that use of gas againstthe Italians would result in the United Nationsusing it against Germany,Comment,   The possible use of gas by germany is no doubt being held over the Italians as a threat,9. Evacuation from Sicily.Some 40,000 German and 75,000 italian troops were evacuated from Sicily.10. Genoral.(a). General Z was not so impressive as general C. He appeared genuine however and as chief of Biauuzto (?) Roatta had evidently given/thought to

evidently given/thought to the many problems confronting Italy.   Hecould bo described as mediocre Staff Officer witha sound but stolid outlook on strategy.    Ho gavefollowing views which are of interest.(b). Ho had considered 5 aspects of thepresent situation, 1 if Germany took initiative and 4 if Allies did.    Those woro:-(1),   German case.     This considered most urgent as they might attack Italy at any momentunder conditions which would oblige Italy to resist.This was no case for Allies to pull Italian chest-nuts out of fire but in order to avoid return ofFascism or Communism there- must be coordinatedplan with Allies,(2).   First Allied case.    Attack on Germanythrough Italy.    This considered (rather naturally)most unfavourable action, requiring some 15 to 20Divisions.    There must however be coordinated plangiving Italy specific roles.(3).   Second Allied case.    If Allied  .landing was to bo in Balkans, Italy must be given special role..(4).   Third Allied case.     In event of   &quot;attack on Sardinia or Corsica, essential thatItalians on Islands should not be asked to assistbut instructed to offer minimum resistance toAllies.     Italian assistance to Allies would merelylead to Germany taking over Italy.(5).   Fourth Allied Case.     Attack byAllies elsewhere outside tho barrier of the Alpsmight mean the withdrawal of some Gorman divisions from Italy.    Although this ca.se would result in italy fighting Germany unaided and this she was prepared to do.(c).   Z made no objections whatever to ouractual terms. Military, political, or economic.He considered that strong objection would be takenby Badoglio to tho phrasing used in part of thecomplete surrender terms (longer document).    The;wording of the Preamble of this document he described as ;jBrutalH.    -Ho considered that a groat effort/would have to

groat effort/would nave to bo made by tho younger Generals whoboliovod in cooperation with tho Allies to overcometho objections of Badoglio arid the King to thedistasteful words &quot;Unconditional surrender&quot; and roperoften that everything the Allies wish could boobtained without imposing this unnecessary indignitywhich might result in the present Government, whichwas sincere and honest, refusing the termse   he stated that the present. Government was brought into being by men who, from the beginning, had deploredan unnatural alliance and word determined that thebrand of Germany should not be imposed on tho italy of the future even if this meant fighting Germanyalone and he urged us to reconsider what he termed&quot;Unnecessarily brutal phrasing- of our final termsremarking that tho Military victory should bo far more important to us than a political victory.11. Corsica and Sardinia.Details wore givon concerning composition of Gorman and Italian Troops which do not differ to information already in our possession.12. Finally, General z stated that in (event &apos;of Allied attack on Italy without diversions else-where, Germans would send further into Italy, 10to 12 Divisions,(Circulation)Brigadier JacobMr. AttleeForeign secretary sir Alexander CadoganMr. Jebb, Foreign office mr, P,J.

I have discussed with President yoursuggestion for a military political commission ofrepresentatives of our three countries.     The Presidentis sending.you his views.&apos;2. If a formal commission is to be set up make the following suggestions as to its constitution and scope, from which&quot;1 think the President would not dissent, but he is telegraphing separately,3. As to its location, I will agree to Sicilyif you are- sot upon it, but I believe either Tunisor Algiers, which a,re an established Allied Head-quarters, would be more convenient.   . There will bono harm in trying both.4. I suggest members of tho commission shouldbe political representatives appointed by the three governments, each reporting to his Government direct.The commission could not of course supersede .oroverride tho authority of tho Gcvormoirts concerned./The representatives

concerned./The representatives may require to be assisted by military advisors.     Tho political representatives should be kept informed by their Governments ofmilitary and -political developments affectingtheir work, and would in their turn inform theirpments:.     They could3Governments of local devoloimake joint representations to their Governments,but-would not have the power to take final decisions.They would, of course, not interfere with themilitary functions of the Allied Commander-in-chief,5,    .1  . I was glad to find that you agreed that a french member might be added.    The President, towhom I have submitted the idea, also seemed inclined to accept it with certain reservations.    We must remember that before long the French will presumablyhave ten or more fully equipped divisions which will certainly be needed in action..6, There are others, notably Greeks andYugoslavs, who are directly interested, and I suggestwe should devise a procedure for calling them infor consultation when questions of direct concern tothem are under examination.7. As I understand it, the commission would inthe first instance handle tho Italian question only.When other cases arise, experience should haveshown whether.this or some other organ would be thobest medium for co-ordinating our views and plans.8, The President is making to you the differentsuggestion that you might&apos;think it sufficient to sendan officer to General Eisenhower1s H,Q* seeing thatthe commission, if set up, would meet almost con-currently with the conference of Foreign Ministers,it may be that you will agree that the Presidentsplan meets the case,9, In the event of it being decided to establish the commission, I should be grateful to learn; whether you agree with the proposals I have made above.The commission, if it is desired, should be set goincrthis month, but see my immediately following.   ,MDB0.   - To0o0o 050047Z,

Reference   WEfljEARE 604.This is text of Presidents message to Stalin.BEGINS -1. Tho Prime Minister and I are both happy atthe idea of the military, political meeting on theForeign Office level./2. I think it should be held as soon as possible.What would you think of a date about September 25th.3. In regard to location, the Prime Minister has suggested London or somewhere in England and I wouldbe willing to have my representatives go to either ofthese if you also think it best.    However, I am inclined to the thought of a more remote spot wherealso the membership of tho meeting would be lesssurrounded by reporters,    I would be Inclined tosuggest Casablanca or Tunis.     I do not object toSicily but the communications from and to there are more difficult.. .4. The political representatives would, ofcourse, report to their respective Governmentsbecause I do not think we could give plenary powersto them.     They could be advised on militarydevelopments by attaching one or two militaryadvisors to them, though I do not want to have themeeting develop at this stage in a full scale */Combined Staffs&apos; .

full scale/Combined Staffs&apos; Conference.5. If Mr. Molotov comes and Mr. Eden, I would wish to send Mr.-Hull, but I do not believe thatthe latter should make such a long journey and Iwould therefore send the Under Secretary of state,Mr. Welles.-    Mr. Harriman would go with Mr. Wellesbecause he has such good knowledge of all shipping,lend-lease and commercial matters.    For an american military adviser I will try to send somebody from my Joint Staff who is in complete touch with the &apos;work of the Combined Staffs.6. The tenacity and drive of your armies ismagnificent and I congratulate you again.7.        While this coming conference is a very goodthing I still hope that you and Mr. Churchill and Ican meet as soon as possible.     I personally could arrange to meet in a place as far as North Africabetween November 15th and December 15th.    I knowyou will understand that I cannot be away from washington more than about twenty days because, under our Constitution, no one can sign for me when I amaway.8, Turning now to a commission to sit in Sicilyin connection with carrying out of further settlementswith Italy, why net send an officer to Eisenhower&apos;headquarters where he,would join the British and americans who are now working on this very subject.9. I have no objection to adding a Frenchmember to their meetings, because wo are in the midstof. equipping ten7 or eleven of their divisions in north africa.    However, Li-think it would be very unwise to--have tho French take port in discussions relating tothe military occupation of Italy.    If the Italiansgo through with surrender terms already signed i hope the^ will bo able wholeheartedly to assist thooccupation troops.    bn the whole, the Italiansgreatly dislike the French and if we bring the Frenchinto occupation discussions at this time the civil and military elementp in Italy will greatly resent it.10.     .
