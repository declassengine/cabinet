(43)288THE MINISTER OP STATE said that for some time past there had been indications that there might be aserious outbreak of disorder and violence in Palestineas soon as the ?ar ended in Europe, or possibly a fewmonths earlier.      He had discussed the situation withthe Middle Eastern War Council, and he had thought it right to take the opportunity, while he was in thiscountry,  to bring the matter to the notice of the WarCab inet.The Zionist leaders in Palestine were nowcommitted to extremist policies;    and the officialorgans of the movement were openly pledged to the&quot;-Siltmcre Resolutions&quot; which demanded the immediatecreation of a Jewish National State.      During the past few years -the Jewish community in Palestine had been increasingly   regimented on totalitarian lines;    and Jews who openly opposed the Party views were now in personal danger.    &quot;in his Memorandum (W.P, (43) 246) theMinister had indicated the force available to the zionist leaders, both in trained men and arms;    andiiad quoted evidence suggesting that the leaders wouldnot   hesitate to use this force,  not only against theArabs but against the British authorities,  in orderto achieve their political objectives.The Minister of State recommended that, whateverlong-term policy might be adopted in respect of theJewish problem, our short-term policy in palestine should be to restrain the extremists among the Jewishleaders;    and to strengthen the influence of the moreO moderate elements in Jewish opinion.

V7e should also maintain within a reasonable distancea sufficient number of troops to ensure that any outbreakof violence in Palestine could be quickly suppressed;    andwe should take steps to bring the police in Palestine upto strength.He also thought that further action should be takento control the traffic in arms;    and, while there could beno question of any house-to-house search, known caches ofarms should be seised.The following were the main points made in further discussion:-(a) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES endorsed the views expressed by the Minister of Stateregarding the aims of the extremist leaders in Palestine and their readiness to resort toviolence in pursuit of those aims.      There was,however, still a good deal of moderate opinion in Palestine, and also outside Palestine;    andit should certainly be our aim to strengthen the hands of the moderates.      For this purposea Joint Declaration by ourselves and theUnited States Government would be very helpful.The proposal for the issue of such a joint declaration at this stage met with general approval.(b) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA,  however,  thoughtthat the Joint Declaration, the keynote of whichwas a warning against continuance of the presentagitation, should be accompanied by a statementof what we hoped to do for the Jews after thewar, and also a broad reaffirmation of the pledges which we had given to the Arabs.(c) THE .SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR also hoped that action at the present time would go beyond aDeclaration on the lines suggested in W.P.(43) 278,and that some of the suggestions made by theMinister of Aircraft Production in his memorandum (-W. P,(43) 288) would he adopted.(d) THE PRIME MINISTER thought that our chief aim atthe present time should be to keep the situation as quiet as possible and to avoid bringing theJewish-Arab problem into undue prominence.      he strongly favoured a Joint Declaration by ourselves and the United States, but thought that thestatement should not go into too much detail.This view met with general approval.(e) As regards the text of the Declaration, the ,/war cabinet , on the whole, preferred the UnitedStates draft,  subject to the addition of a sentence making it clear that we could not permit or acquiesce in forcible -changes in thestatus of Palestine.      THE FOREIGN SECRETARY,however,  pointed out that the second sentence of paragraph 2 would require further consideration,since it might be read as implying that the&quot;/kite Paper policy no longer held the field.

While many members of the War Cabinet had opposed that settlement and would like to see it modified when opportunity offered,  itwould he undesirable to give any publicindication at this stage that modifications of the White Paper policy were in contemplation.(f ) Immigration. &apos; There was general support for theview that Jewish immigration should be permittedafter the 31st March,  194-4, up to the ./hite. Paper number of 75,000.      The best way of giving effect to this would have to be examined inconsultation with the High Commissioner.(g) On the question of arms. THE PRIME MINISTER saidthat there would be plenty of troops availablefor internal security purposes,  for which onlylight columns would be needed.      There was no need for anxiety on this score.He was glad that the Jews were well armed.      Pierecalled the anxiety which they had shown tofight for us at a time when it had looked as though the enemy would gain control of Syriaand Iraq..In discussion,   it was explained that, while theArabs mostly had their arms in their individualpossession,  it was known that the Jews hadaccumulated large caches of arms,  includingmachine-guns.      It was agreed that there couldbe no question of house-to-house search,  andit therefore followed that any action against cachesx of arms would affect the Jews and not the Arabs.At the present time no active steps were beingtaken to- search for or seize arms in Palestine.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there should be nochange in our policy on this matter Y/ithoutspecific reference to the War Cabinet.(h) FIELD MARSHAL WAVELL gave his views as the resultof his long experience of Palestine.      He had great admiration for the Jews in Palestine,who were of a fine type;    and he thought that,if fighting &quot;&quot;broke out, the Jews in Palestine,left to themselves, and provided there was no interference from outside, would defeat theArabs in Palestine.      It would, of course, bea disaster if we allowed such a situation tocome to pass.      In his opinion, the.pledgeswhich had been given to the Arabs had. created a situation of real difficulty.      At the sametime,  he thought that the present Jewishaspirations in Palestine constituted a danger to&quot;the security of the British Coramonwea1thand Empire.Discussion then turned on long-term policy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that during the last warthe Government - of the day,  for good reasons, had deliberately committed themselves by the balfour declaration to the project of a National Home for theJews in Palestine.      He personally was committed to the

view that the White Paper of 1938 was a breach of thatsolemn undertaking.      No doubt the publication of thepolicy set out in the White Paper had created furtherdifficulties.      But all the lessons of the last two orthroe years went to show that difficult situations couldnot be surmounted except by facing them resolutely.      Atthe proper time it would,  in his view, be our duty to showthat we were not prepared to be driven off solemn under-takings which we had given.      Timing was important, however,end he did not think that the present was a good moment at which to take action which would bring into prominencethe Jew-Arab question.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS,&apos; whileagreeing that it would be inexpedient to re-open at thisstage public controversy about Palestine,  said that hethought it important that we should begin to consider our long-term policy without delay, so that we should be ina position to put it into effect as  soon as the war came to an end.      If extremists on either side got intocontrol .at the end of the.war,  the results might well be disastrous for the future of Jews all over the world.There was general support for the view that itwould be desirable to deal with the long-term policy,  ifpossible,  on a somewhat broader basis than hitherto.There was much to be said for a scheme of partition inPalestine,  if means could be found (e.g. by recoveringTrons-Jordania) to create a Jewish State of a reasonablesize.      Alternatively, or in addition, there might besatellite Jewish settlements in other areas e.g.Cyrenaica,  Tripolitania or Eritrea.      THE foreign secretary said that these latter possibilities were already under co ns i dera t i o n.It was generally agreed that, while there could beno question of any early declaration on this point,  itwas desirable that early consideration should be given tothe formulation of our long-term policy for Palestine.The War Cabinefs conclusions on the points calling for immediate action were as follows-   (l) The first need was for action which would help to damp down the existing agitation and prevent any further aggravation of theposition in Palestine.      For this purpose,a Joint Declaration by ourselves and theUnited States would be most valuable.(2) The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for the Colonieswere asked to settle the terms of the draft declaration.      It was suggested that this might follow the form of the draftsuggested by the United States Government^(amended so as to be a Declaration by thetwo Governments and not by the united nations, a sentence on the following linesbeing substituted for the concludingsentence of that draft:.-st Sub-enclosure to Annex I to W.P.(43) 278.-4-

&quot;In any case, as His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have already stated,  no decision affecting the basic situation. &apos;     in Palestine should be reached withoutfull consultation with all concerned,including both Arabs and Jews;    butthey wish to make it clear that theyhave no intention of permitting oracquiescing in forcible changes of -any kind in the status of Palestine&apos;or the administration of the country.The United States Government are infull accord with this assurance.&quot;(a) The draft Declaration, as amended, shouldbe sent to the High Commissioner forPalestine for his observations before a reply was sent to the United states ambassador.(4-) It was decided in principle that the period during which Jewish immigration should be permitted, up to the White Paper figureof 75,000, should be extended beyond the31st March, 1944.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesundertook to consult the High Commissioneras to the best way of giving effect tothis decision.(This conclusion is not to be taken asprejudicing later decisions by the WarCabinet on immigration policy when theWhite&apos; Paper figure has been attained).(5) No change should be made,  without priorreference to the War Cabinet,  in thepresent approved policy for dealingwith illegal stores of arms, Jewish orArab;    and no measures should be takento disarm the Jews unless or until equalmeasures could be effectively enforcedagainst the Arabs,(6) A Cabinet Committee should be appointedto consider the long-term policy forPalestine.The Prime Minister undertook to nominatethe Ministers who should be asked toserve on this Committee.7th Jvfty. 1943
