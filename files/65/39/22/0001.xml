(43) 122ndConclusions,Minute l).The War Cabinet had before them the following memoranda in regard to Ireland:-(a) By the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,dated 2nd September, covering a draft ofa letter from President Roosevelt toMr.   de Valera (\7;.P. (43) 387).(b) By the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs  (W. P. (43) 402).(c) By the Home Secretary (W. P. (43) 409).(d) By the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsdated 21st September, 1943 (W.P. (43) 408)covering a message from the United StatesGovernment,  communicated by the UnitedStates Ambassador (Annex &quot;Au)j and the revised draft of the proposed message from President Roosevelt to Mr.   de Valera(Annex &quot;B&quot;).The War Cabinet also had before them a copy of telegram WELFARE 620 from the Prime Minister to theForeign Secretary on this matter, dated 5th September,1943.      This telegram was in reply to telegram CONCRETENo.  716,  despatched by the Foreign Secretary after theWar Cabinet had considered the first draft of theletter which President Roosevelt was thinking of sending to Mr.   de Valera (W. P. (43) 387).THE PRIME MINISTER said that Southern Ireland,which had in the past made a valuable contribution tothe work of the British peoples, had now sunk into an ignominious position.      He hoped greatly that this state of affairs would not continue.      In the longrun it was certainly not in the best interests of theBritish Commonwealth and Empire.      He thought that itwas decidedly to our advantage that the United states should raise this matter at the present time.      TheUnited States had a strong interest in the position,seeing that 1% million American soldiers would shortly be crossing the Atlantic.      The fact ofIreland&apos;s neutrality   and the presence.of Axis Legationsin Dublin increased the risks of the passage of the atlantic,  and this gave the United States good ground for raising the matter.      Moreover, this was anopportunity &quot;which would not recur.-1-

The Prime Minister referred to the suggestionthat the sending of this letter by the President mightbe resented by public opinion in this country.      he did not see why this should be so, having regard tothe American interest in the matter.      In any case,,the United States Government were in diplomatic relations with Southern Ireland, and they wereperfectly within their rights in sending a letter tothe Head of the Southern Ireland Government,  just asthey might make representations to Canada orAustralia,The Prime Minister thought that,   if the matter were now to be raised by the United States,this might give us an opportunity for secret discussions withrepresentatives of Northern Ireland, which might well prove the first step in a chain of events leading toa solution of the Irish problem,,      On the other hand,if Mr.   de Valera sent a reply which was a rebuff tothe United States Government,  then the attitude ofthe United States on this matter would be on recordand he did not see that the fact that the approachhad been made and had failed would be to ourdi s a dva nt age.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that Mr.  de Valera, having consistently preachedneutrality for four years, was now powerless to changehis course even if he -wished to do so.      It wascurious too that many Irishmen who were fightinggallantly in the Armed Forces of the Grown, neverthelessbelieved that Mr.  de Valera was right to maintainneutrality.He did not believe that Mr. .de Valera would send a blunt negative to the President&apos;s letter.On the contrary, he would seize the occasion tojustify Ireland&apos;s neutrality bypreference to the partition issue,  and the United States would then getinvolved in a discussion of this issue.      Furthermore,he thought it was an illusion that the Americans were more popular in Ireland than the people of thiscountry;    and he did not like to allow the Americans,by taking this matter up, to acquire some standing Inthe relationships between this&apos; country and one of theDominions.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that he would like to see the Irish questionexplored-    but he doubted whether it was possible tomake any progress with Mr.   de Valera,      He looked foran ultimate solution on Federal lines.      Furthermore,if a letter of the kind was sent by the President toMr.   de Valera, he feared that discussion of the Irishquestion would again become active in this country,At the present moment the Irish people in liverpool and Glasgow were out of sympathy with Southern.Ireland.      This was all to the good, so far as concerned war production.      Finally,  he feared an unfavourable reaction if this issue was raised bythe United States Government rather than by ourselves.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRSdoubted whether there was any chance of an approachby the United States resulting in Ireland coming intothe war on our side.      He was sure that Mr.   de Valerahsanswer to the letter would raise the partition issue,and that opinion in this country would resent it ifthe Americans got involved in discussion of that issue.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the ultimate solution of the Irish question must be one which not onlyprovided for a united Ireland but also for the due-safeguarding of our defence interests.      otherwise there was a risk that a united Ireland with dominion status might not allow us the use of ports either inNorthern or in Southern Ireland, which we required for defence purposes.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA deprecatedthe Irish issue being raised at the present time.. He feared that the result would be to create theimpression tha t the United States and this country were bringing pressure to bear on Ulster.      Thiswould be most unfortunate.THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION was anxiousto see the Irish question raised, but thought that itshould be raised by ourselves and not by the UnitedStates Government.      He thought we should begin withsecret and informal soundings, and if it appeared that negotiations would have any chance of success thematter could be opened up with the Northern ireland government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR expressed himself as in general agreement with the views ofthe Minister of Aircraft Production.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL, Avhile wishing to see asolution of the Irish question,  thought that thepresent approach was not on the right lines.      He thoughtthat the right plan was to allow the present position tocontinue until after the war, by which time the Irishwould have realised that we were not dependent on thembut they were&apos; dependent on us.      When this lesson hadbeen fully learnt,  there was some hope that Mr.   de valera would feel compelled to make an approach to us,and we should then say to him that we were preparedto negotiate if he would produce a plan whichsafeguarded the position of Northern Ireland, and our defence interests.      A solution was more likely to befound if Southern Ireland were forced into a positionin which they had to take the initiative in raising the question.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL and THE foreign secretary drew attention to the fact that the revised draft letter communicated by the United states ambassador (Annex &quot;3&quot; to W.P.(45) 408) differedsubstantially from the earlier draft.      It was truethat the new draft did not contain a number of the passages to which the Thar Cabinet had previously takenexception.      On the other hand, the draft,  taken as awhole, was a much less convincing document.      Further-more,   it  was not now proposed that the letter andMr.   de Valera&apos;s reply&quot;should be published.

ENf)   131The view was expressed that an approach on thelines now suggested was not calculated to bring aboutthe result which the Prime Minister wished to see,namely, of raising the whole Irish question, since thedemand made was limited to asking that the american forces might hove Naval and Air facilities in southern ireland,   if in the event they needed them, for the duration.of the war and six months thereafter.Furthermore,  the document made no reference to northern Ireland,  and seemed to ignore this aspect of the problem.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he felt strongly that the Irish issue should be.raised, and that weshould frame a definite Irish policy.      He did not feel that we could continue to leave matters on theirpresent footing.      For his own part,  he thought thatthe present was the right time to raise the issue.He agreed, however,  that the revised draft set-outin W. P., (45) 408 should be further examined, and hesuggested that the discussion should be resumed ata later Meeting.        &apos; . -The V/ar Cabinet recorded no Conclusion, and agreed that the discussion should be resumed at alater date.
