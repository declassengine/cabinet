IW.M.(43)  107th CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE confidential Annex(29th July,  1943,   5.30 p., rac )TRADE disputes and TRADE   .UNIONS ACT,1927.(previous reference sW.M. (43) 105thConclusions,Minute 2).The War Cabinet resumed discussion of thismatter.      The following were the main points hearing onthe action to he taken to deal with the immediate situation.(a) General agreement was expressed with theview that it was impossible for any action to be takenin regard to amendment of the Act while the threat ofthe pending application for affiliation to the T. U. C.was outstanding.(T?) It was also agreed that the members of theUnion affected were,  generally speaking, probablyunaware of their position under the law if the Union&apos;application for affiliation was accepted.      Theposition sas of course that they would be given amonth&apos;s warning, after which they would have to resignfrom the union or forfeit their position as establishedCivil Serve, nts.(c) The view was expressed that the rank and filewho for the most part showed, no great enthusiasm or interest in this matter, were in danger of being misledby their leaders,  and that a situation might -well arisevery similar to the second Police Strike after thelast war.(d) Accordingly, there was strong support forthe view that a warning should be given before theapplication for affiliation was considered by theT.U. C.  on the 6th September.(e) it was at first suggested that this warning should be given by high officials of the Departmentsconcerned.      Later, however,   it was suggested, and agreed,  that the warning should be given by the PrimeMinister.; who had already undertaken to receive aDeputation from three Unions (the Post office engineering Union,  the Inland Revenue Staff Federation,and the Civil Service Clerical Association).( ) It was urged that one of the outstandingdifficulties of the present position was that it was difficult   to press the Unions to withdraw their threatunless some indication could be given that the position,in regard to amendment of Section 5 of the Act, wasnot closed.      As against this it was felt that, whilethe threat was outstanding, there could be no discussion by members of the Government with the representativesof the Unions, the effect of which would be to hold outhopes of amendment of Section. 5 of the Act.

(g1) The view was also expressed in discussion that,  however much it might he desired to remove a source of grievance and to facilitate the harmoniousco-operation of the Trade Unions in the war effort,   theConservative Ministers in the Government were hardlyin a position to undertake that any amending legislation could he carried through either House of Parliament,The whole matter was one which was likely to give riseto strong partisan feeling,.hh) This risk of arousing antagonism was astrong argument against the suggestion - made in thecourse of discussion - that this matter should be thesubject of a Debate in Parliament after the Recess,In view of the history of this matter,  such a debate would clearly put the Ministers of a National Government&apos;drawn from parties which held strong hut opposingviews - unto a very awkward position,(S) The strong controversial feelings likelyto be aroused by this matter afforded another argument for taking all possible steps to avoid a head-oncollision on this matter arising out of the TradeUnion Congress meeting In the first week in September.The VAar Cabinet -(l)  Invited the Prime Minister to make arrangements to see in the near future the Deputation which he had undertaken to receive from three Civil ServiceUnions (the Post Office engineering union, the Inland Revenue StaffFederation, and the Civil ServiceClerical Association),      The PrimeMinister asked that the Postmaster-General should accompany him on this occasion,(2)  Invited the Lord President of theCouncil to prepare,  in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, the draftof a statement which the Prime minister might make to the Deputation on this occasion.(3) Agreed that this statement (or a summary ofit) would be made public after thedeputation has been received.      Itwould follow the lines generallyindicated in discussion,  and inparticular would set out the consequences which would ensue if the application foraffiliation to the T. U. 0.   now pending was^proceeded with.30th July,  1943.
