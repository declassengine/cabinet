The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 898-904: In the home theatre bad weather had impeded our bomberoperations.In the Middle East the enemy had lost 8 destroyed, 12 probably destroyed and 13 damaged: we liad lost 12.At Malta, which continued to be heavily attacked from the air,the enemy had lost 3 probably destroyed and 10 damaged; we had lost 5 (4 on the ground) and 11 damaged on the ground.In the Dutch East Indies we had lost 50 aircraft (25 on theground) and the enemy 35.In the Dutch East Indies enemy cruisers, destroyers andtransports had been attacked from the air on the 14th February. Itwas thought that at least 3 cruisers and 1 destroyer had been hit and 1 transport sunk. Later reports might show an increase inthese figures.A German cruiser and pocket battleship had been attacked that morning in Norwegian waters by one of our submarines. It was hoped that a hit had been obtained.During the previous week 164,000 tons of shipping had been lost, including marine casualties. Most of our losses had occurred in the Dutch East Indies area and off the American Coast.The Cabinet were informed of the disposition of the Japaneseland forces in the Far East and of the reinforcements due to arrive in the Far East and the Indian Ocean area.Our troops had withdrawn behind the Sittang River after hardfighting. f.In Libya enemy columns had advanced on the 14th February,but had withdrawn two days later.Russian attacks had met with heavier resistance. The onlymarked progress made by the Russians was in the Donets area.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.AustralianTroopMovements.2. The War Cabinet discussed the movements of an australian Division. The discussion and the Conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.aircraft production.Production and repair facilities in India.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 21stConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Minister of Labour and National Service said that thereport prepared by the Minister of Aircraft Production, inaccordance with the request which he had made a week ago, madea strong case against establishing capacity to manufacture aircraft in India at the present moment. The report pointed out, however,that, if the production of aircraft in India was to be increased, itwould be necessary to establish adequate repair facilities, and thiswould probably be the best way in which to use Indian resources.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Air to furnish a reporton this suggestion.[23499] B 2
Repatriation of civilians from italian EastAfrica.Sinking of an italian Tanker.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 57thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The War Cabinet were reminded that we had reached anagreement with the Italian Government that they should provideships, under safe-conduct from us, for the repatriation of civiliansto Italy. Unfortunately, an Italian tanker, fetching oil undersafe-conduct from us as part of this arrangement, had been sunk.The Foreign Secretary said that there were extenuating cir-cumstances. Nevertheless, he thought that we should express ourregret.It was suggested in discussion that, while we should not offer,compensation for the ship which had been sunk, we might undertaketo provide a quantity of fuel oil equivalent to that carried by thistanker.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe First Lord of the Admiralty to settle this matter insuch a way as to ensure that the sinking of this tanker didnot bring to an end the scheme for the repatriation of italian civilians from Italian East Africa.France:Relations withYlchyGovernment.Martinique.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 21stConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Foreign Secretary referredsubmarines had refuelled at Martinique.The War Cabinet-to reports that enemyAgreed that the Foreign Secretary should communicate this information to the United States Government, urgingthem to take strong action.Treatment ofPrisoners at hong Kong.Question of publicity.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 21stConclusions,Minute 9.)6. The War Cabinet had under consideration the question of publicity about the treatment of prisoners at Hong Kong.It was pointed out in discussion that many of the allegationshad not been verified. But it seemed unlikely that we should be ableto verify some of the reports until after the war. How could thematter be kept quiet until then? In any case, the Japanese, by refusing their consent to the visit to Hong Kong of representativesof the International Red Cross Committee or of the protecting power, had laid themselves open to the gravest suspicion thatatrocities had taken place.Some publicity on this matter could not be avoided. Inparticular, the Foreign Secretary said that it would be very difficultto ask the Chinese Government to suppress publicity on this matter,There was also reason to believe that the best way to stopatrocities would be to give them full and early publicity. This hadbeen the line which the Chinese had always taken, e.g., in regard tothe Nanking outrages. It was essential, however, to give prominenceto the ill-treatment of Asiatics as well as Europeans.For these reasons the balance of argument was felt to be infavour of publication. Both General Wavell and the Governor of burma had, however, opposed publication of the atrocities at HongKong. It would therefore be right that they should both heconsulted before a final decision was reached.
125W.M. (23 (12).Accordingly, the War Cabinet Invited the Secretaries of State for War and Burma tosend short telegrams to General Wavell and Sir ReginaldDorman Smith summarisihg the points made in discussion,drawing attention to those in favour of publicity whichhad weighed with the War Cabinet, and inviting an earlyexpression of their views.Home Defence.Scheme for evacuation \of coastal Areas.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 21stConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (42) 91)covering a report by the Civil Defence Committee, proposing certain modifications of the Scheme for the compulsory evacuation ofcertain towns at or near the coast of South-East England if invasionwas imminent.The main point discussed was whether the Brighton group of towns should be included in any scheme for the evacuation of coastaltowns.The serious disadvantages of this course from the civil pointof view were pointed out; in particular, that most of the inhabi-tants of this group of towns would have to be evacuated into central london.The War Cabinet were informed that, if the possibility of evacuating the Brighton group of towns was to be faced, it wouldbe &quot;necessary to carry out a registration scheme in the townsconcerned, and to make the necessary arrangements for billeting invarious London boroughs. This would inevitably involve somepublicity.The War Cabinet were also informed that the French schemefor the evacuation of Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing, containing a population of 800,000 people, had worked satisfactorily in 1940,although its results had been nullified by the German forces gettinground to the-rear of these towns and causing the people who hadbeen evacuated to return.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) Plans for the evacuation of the thirty-one towns should be framed on the basis that the War Cabinet will be askedto authorise evacuation to begin twenty-one days beforethe enemy&apos;s preparations for invasion are likely to becompleted, it being understood that the War cabinet will decide, in the light of all the relevant considerationsat the time, whether to authorise evacuation.(2) A scheme on the same basis should also be prepared for theevacuation of the Brighton group of towns on the under-standing that, when the time came for the War Cabinetto consider whether compulsory evacuation should beeffected, the need for putting into force each section(e.g., the Brighton group of towns) should receiveseparate examination.Home Defence.Role of the CivilPopulation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minute 10.)8. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityreferred to a Motion put down by Lord Mottistone : &quot;To call attention to the status of civilians in the event of invasion inaccordance with the law of the land and the provisions of TheHague Convention of 1907, especially Articles I and II of Conven-tion 4, and to request His Majesty&apos;s Government to issue preciseinstructions; and to move for Papers.&quot; Mr. Lipson also had putdown a Question to the Prime Minister on the same subject.
The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that,in the light of the experience of guerrilla warfare in Russia, hethought that there was a case for examining whether any amend-ment was called for in the previous instructions in this matter,which had been included in the leaflet approved by the War Cabinetin July 1940 (W.P. (G) (40) 197).The War Cabinet Invited the Lord President of the Council to examine, inconsultation with the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security and any other Ministers concerned, thequestion whether the instructions issued on this matterrequired amendment.Great George Street, S. W. 1,February 23, 1942.
