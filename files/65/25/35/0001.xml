The Press. 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Lord(Previous ^President of the Council, as Chairman of the Committee ofReference: Ministers appointed to consider what steps should be taken toW.M. (42) 32nd prevent the publication in this country of articles, or the sendingConclusions, out of this country of messages, calculated to undermine publicMinute 4.) morale at home or to create ill-feeling between the United Nations(W.P. (42) 124).As regards publication in this country, the Committee had advised that action could be taken under Regulation 2d. Theydoubted, however, whether it was realised by Parliament, the Pressor the Public that unwarranted and malignant criticism of those inauthority came within the scope of this Regulation, which was generally regarded rather as an instrument for use against positivepropaganda in opposition to the war or in favour of a negotiatedpeace.The Committee therefore recommended that the HomeSecretary should make a considered statement in answer to a parliamentary Question-, explaining the Governments view of thepublication of such material, and making it clear that it was their intention to act under Regulation 2d against any newspaper whichoffended in the future.In discussion, it was pointed out that, while the course ofaction proposed might arouse opposition in the newspapers, itwould not have the advantages which would follow from positive action.It was pointed out, however, that.it was quite clear, from the debates in Parliament at the time when Regulation 2d had been enacted, that it was contemplated by Parliament that the Regula1-tion would be used to deal with Communist, Fascist or Pacifistanti-war agitation, and not for the purposes now&quot; suggested.Further, there was reason to believe that the Press as a whole tookstrong exception to the systematic publication of articles of the type which had been so frequent in the Daily Mirror, and was unlikely to be critical of an announcement on the. lines proposed.The War Cabinet accordingly favoured the course suggestedin the Lord Presidents Report on the clear understanding that, if further unwarranted and malignant criticism was published in the daily Mirror, immediate action would be taken.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security thenhanded round copies of a draft Question and Answer.The following were the main points in discussion: (a) A sentence should be added to explain the purport of regulation 2d.(b) The   draft  Question  and Answer  might  perhaps  beshortened.(c) It would be desirable to quote from the two recent articles in the Daily Mirror, which were calculated to undermine the confidence of the Army as a whole in their Officers.(d) More emphasis might perhaps be laid on the fact that therehad already been a systematic publication in the DailyMirror of matter &apos;&apos; calculated to foment opposition,&apos;&apos; &amp;c.Discussion then took place as to the additional restrictions which should be placed on incoming and outgoing messages. It wasagreed that the proposal in paragraph 8 of the Memorandum shouldbe widened so as to include information likely to be of value to theenemy. Further, it was important to deal with speculations as to future operations, such as had recently been published not only inthis country, but also in outgoing messages. The conclusions of theCommittee should be amended accordingly.The War Cabinet&apos;s decisions were as follows : -     (1) A statement should be made by the Home Secretary on thefollowing day explaining that, in the view of the
Parliament. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to announceBusiness of      on tne following day that the House would adjourn for the Easterthe House        Recess ori Thursday, the 26th March, and would meet again onMonday, the 13th April.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.&quot;Soharn- , 3. The Foreign Secretary said that, in&apos;connection with thehorsfand Adjournment of the House, the question was likely to be raised&quot; Gneisenau.&quot;    whether the Report by Mr. Justice Bucknill into the circumstancesMovP from of the move* of the German battle cruisers Scharnhorst andBrest to Gneisenau from Brest to German ports could be published.German Ports. It; was clear that the whole Report could not be published.The BucknillWould it be possible for a short statement, giving the gist of theReport Report, to be made or for the House to be given certain passages-p   .  -__from the Report, either in public or in Secret Session ?Reference- As a ainst this&apos; ^ was felt fcnat publication of part of theWMF ?4*n 91 t -RePort&apos; or of a summary based upon it, might well give rise toi  - complications and at the same time faii to satisfy the critics of thoConclusions,      Government. *- Government, systematic publication of irresponsible andmalignant criticism of the kind referred to made a newspaper liable to suppression under Regulation 2d,and that it was their intention to act under this Regula-tion against any newspaper which offended in the future.(2) The Home Secretary was invited to send for the Editor ofthe Daily Mirror and warn him that the paper wouldbe suppressed if the offence was repeated.(3) The Home Secretary was invited to amend the draft reply toa Private Notice Question to be,given on the following day, in the light of the suggestions made in discussion.(4) No corresponding statement should be made in the Lords.(5) The Minister of Information should make a statement inParliament withdrawing the previous assurances whichhad been given to ohe effect that (a) Censorship will be confined to matters affectingmilitary security; and(b) Material already published in this country may becabled abroad without further question;&quot;and giving warning that, in future, stricter control would be exercised with a view to stopping outgoingmessages (i) calculated to give information of value tothe enemy; or (ii) containing speculations as to future operations; or (iii) which might compromise the relations of this country with foreign Powers; or (iv) calculated to create ill-feelings between the United Nations them-selves, or between them, or any one of them, and a neutral country.(6) The Minister of Information should also take steps to warn the Editors that they should not publish in this countryspeculations in regard to future operations. He shouldmake it clear that, if this practice continued, a Regula-tion would be passed to deal with it.(7) Censors should be instructed in future to widen the categories of incoming messages which they report tothe Ministry of Information, with a view to theauthorities persuading the Editors to discard or modifya message before publication here.(8) The Dominion Governments should be informed of theaction taken under Conclusions (5), (6) and (7), witha view to their taking corresponding action.
The general view of the War Cabinet (based on the groundthat it was unprofitable to have a Debate on operations of war when the full facts could not be disclosed) was thatthe Leader of the House should state that it was notpossible to publish the Report, nor was it the Govern-ment&apos;s intention to make a further statement in regard tothis matter.The Far East.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 34thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that lord Addison had put down a Motion proposing that a RoyalCommission should be appointed to enquire into and report on the defences of Singapore.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toendeavour to dissuade Lord Addison from continuingwith this Motion.(2) Agreed that, if this Motion was persisted in, the request should be refused.Free France.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 34thConclusions,Minute 4.)obtaining: a5. The War Cabinet gave further consideration to the dispute between General de Gaulle and Admiral Muselier.The view generally expressed was that Admiral Muselier had put himself in the wrong in this matter, and that General de Gaullemust therefore be supported. The First Lord of the Admiraltythought, however, that there was a risk that a solution which didnot retain the Admiral as Commander-in-Chief would lead to difficulties in the Free French Navy.Great importance was. however,  attached to revision of the present agreement with General de Gauile, including,in particular, the agreement relating to the Free French Navy.The Foreign Secretary suggested that a solution should befound on the&apos; following lines : ;(i) Admiral Muselier remains in the country on sick leave forthe next four weeks,(ii) The post of Commander-in-Chief remains in abeyanceuntil Captain Auboyneau&apos;s return.(iii) Admiral Muselier makes an exceptional recommendation that Captain Auboyneau should be promoted Admiral.(iv) General de Gaulle rescinds his decree declaring Admiral Muselier unattached and in reserve of command,(v) A revised agreement is concluded between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and General de Gaulle covering futureco-operation generally,(iv) Captain Moret goes on leave Until he takes up his newcommand.(vii) General de Gaulle undertakes to offer Admiral Museliereither the post of Inspector-General or some other important command on the termination of his sick leave.The War Cabinets Agreed that a solution on these lines would be satisfactory,and invited the Foreign Secretary and the First Lord ofthe Admiralty to proceed accordingly.
