The Gneisenau and the Scharnhorst were bothback in dry dock.Three enemy merchant ships had been hit, including one tankerof 2,000 tons. An enemy submarine had also probably been hit north of Sidi Barrani.The submarine Unique had attacked an Italian battleship andcruiser, and it was thought that the battleship had been hit. Thesubmarine Upholder had sunk an Italian U-boat off Mersa Matruh.The destroyer Kimberley had been torpedoed north-east of Tobrukand was in tow.During the previous week one merchant ship (2,600 tons) hadbeen sunk by an enemy submarine. Belated reports from the far east brought the total of shipping sunk during the previous week to 23,400 tons. Owing to bad weather and marine casualties,57,000 tons of shipping had been damaged. Up to the 11th January16,567 tons of shipping had been sunk by the enemy, but this totalmight be increased to 25,000 tons.There were indications that enemy submarines were now working in the West Atlantic.There had been no very great changes in the situation in Libya.On the 7th January the enemy had withdrawn from Agedabia. our patrols were now some 25 miles south-east of Agheila. The enemy had received a certain number of supplies from small vessels round the coast, and nine ships had got into Tripoli during the previousweek.  Bad weather was interfering with our operations.Theenemy&apos;s strength was now estimated to be some 36,500 men,partly Germans and partly Italians. Our forces opposed to them were still hampered by maintenance difficulties.On the 7th January General Wavell had arrived at singapore and had flown up to Kuala Lumpur. He had made an examinationof the situation and had decided on new dispositions for our forces.It was thought that Kuala Lumpur had now been evacuated.Details were given of the system of control which had been outlined by General Wavell. He himself would be Supreme Commander,with General Brett as Deputy Supreme Commander and General[23341] b 2
Pownall as Chief of Staff. It was tentatively proposed to set upNaval, Land, Air and Administration Branches under separateheads, together with Intelligence and Publicity Branches, whichwould be under the Chief of Staff.Operational control of Iraq and Persia had now been trans-ferred to the Middle East Command, with the exception of theeastern part of Persia, which would remain under the administra-tive control of India.Russia. During the past week there had been practically no forwardmovement on the part of the Russian forces.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Far East. 2.

The Secretary of State for Foreign &apos; A ffairs gave thefollowing information : The internal difficulties of the Yugoslav Government had come to a head over the week-end. As it was undesirable tointerfere in the domestic affairs of the Yugoslav Government,he had had no alternative but to acquiesce in the arrangementreached whereby the Prime Minister, General Simovitch,resigned, and was succeeded by the present Deputy PrimeMinister. General Mihailovitch was to become Minister ofWar, and General Simovitch would be offered a dignifiedposition.The Vichy Government had now offered terms which gave us little except the right to use the railway and port to evacuateItalian personnel. These terms were unacceptable. TheSecretary of State said that he was telegraphing to the Ministerof State, Cairo, setting out our minimum requirements, and asking him whether he thought there was any likelihood ofsecuring these by negotiation now; if so, he should state his reasons in support of his view.The Netherlands Government were most anxious to berepresented on the joint body in Washington to which general wavell would report. They took the view that they knew far more about conditions in the East Indies than did the UnitedStates Government. The Foreign Secretary said that he had reported this development to the Prime Minister.
St. Pierre andMiquelon.(previous reference:&apos; W.M. (41) 136thConclusions,Minute 5.)The Blockade.Greece.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 2ndConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Lord Privy Seal reminded the War Cabinet that theyhad invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister of Economic Warfare to discuss this matter further witha view to making an agreed recommendation to the War Cabinet.Since then the Prime Minister had received a telegram fromthe Minister of State setting out very forcibly the case in favour ofa concession in the case of Greece.The following were the chief points made in discussion : (a.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Ministerof Economic Warfare said that discussions between their Departments had served to make it clear (i) That it would be impracticable to promote shipments of wheat via Turkey to Greece in a clandestinemanner. If we were to help the Greeks in thismatter, our help would have to be given openly,(ii) That it would be extremely difficult to give this helpwithout giving rise to expectations in othercountries, which might well lead to a wide breachin our whole blockade policy.(6) The First Lord of the A dmiralty referred to a discussion which he had had that day with the Greek Minister anda Greek Admiral. They had given a pitiful account ofthe position in Greece, and had pointed out that Greecehad put a very large quantity of Greek shipping at oiirdisposal, and that they could not see why a number of4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the WarCabinet a telegram (Grey 305) just received from the PrimeMinister setting out the terms on which the United States Government proposed that this matter should be settled.Discussion turned mainly on the proposal in paragraph 1 (iv),which read as follows :  &apos;&apos; The present Administrator shall be withdrawn for theperiod of the war; the appointment of an Administrator shallbe withheld for the same period, and the administration of the islands shall be left in the hands of a consultative Council.&quot;It was not clear whether such a Council was in existence (inwhich case it might be of a Vichy complexion) or would have to be elected. It seemed that the administration of the Islands could onlybe carried on either by an executive Council or by an Administrator.No decision could be taken until this was cleared up.Apart from questions of detail, the general view of the WarCabinet was that the formula contained in the Prime Minister&apos;telegram would come as a bitter blow not only to General de Gaulle,but also to public opinion in this country, which would fail tounderstand how our previous support of the Free French Movementwas compatible with the enforcement of the present terms upon it.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tocommunicate with the Prime Minister, with a view toelucidating the proposals, particularly those relatingto the suggested consultative Council, and explaining thedifficulties which the War Cabinet felt in regard to thematter.(2) On receipt of a reply from the Prime Minister, the foreign secretary was authorised, if he thought fit, to endeavourto persuade General de Gaulle to accept the arrangementproposed.
Greek ships could not be used to take food cargoes to turkey. The attitude of Greek sailors must beconsidered.(c) There was also the consideration that several thousandBritish soldiers were still at large in Greece, and werebeing fed and kept in hiding by Greeks at peril of their lives.(d) The Minister of Economic Warfare said that it was still not clear that the enemy were not taking steps to provide some foodstuffs for Greece. . IIf the War Cabinet decided to promote open ship-ments of foodstuffs to Greece, it was not necessary thatthey should go by way of Turkey. Direct shipments from Egypt to Greece would be easier.(e) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, if itwas decided to send food to Greece, he would, of course,make every endeavour to make sure that the action takenin this case did not lead to concessions to other countries.But he wished it to be on record that he could not feelcertain that all further concessions could be resisted.If a concession was made to Greece it should be confined to wheat, of which he believed there was not ashortage in Germany at the present time.(/) The point has also been made that there was already a leakin the blockade through Vichy France.(g) An argument which could be used to differentiate Greecefrom other enemy occupied countries was that Greecewas not normally self-supporting in foodstuffs.The War Cabinet-(i) Agreed in principle that, in view of the special circum-stances, one cargo of wheat, of up to 8,000 tons, shouldbe sent to Greece,(ii) Recorded the view that this decision did not commit usto send further shipments to Greece or to make any concessions to other enemy-occupied territories.(iii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to telegraph the decision at (i) to the Prime Minister, forhis concurrence, and also to ascertain the views of theUnited States Government on it; and if the PrimeMinister and the United States Government concurred in this decision, to communicate it to the Minister ofState and to request him to make the necessary arrange-ments for shipment.(iv) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tocommunicate the decision at that stage to the Govern-ment of the U.S.S.R.(v) Decided that, for the time being, no publicity should begiven to the concession to Greece; but invited theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to arrange for adraft announcement to be prepared, for use when necessary.Air Raids.Damage and casualties.(previous reference:1   1W.M. (41) 136t!conclusions,,Minute 9.)6. The Home Secretary said that there had been little to reportexcept on the night of Saturday / Sunday, when, in addition to enemy aircraft operating against shipping off the Pembrokeshireand Cornish coasts, some twenty-four had flown inland. Someincidents had been reported from a number of Western and Midlanddistricts. Two people had been killed in Liverpool and a furthertwenty trapped. At Ellesmere Port production at Lobitos Oilfields,Stanlow, had been affected owing to fire and H.E. damage.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
Civil Defence.&quot;Freezing &quot;ofpart-time volunteers in theCivil defence services.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 130thConclusions.)&apos; 7. The War Cabinet had before them a joint Memorandum bythe Home Secretary and Minister for Home Security, Minister ofHealth and Secretary of State for Scotland (W.P. (42) 17).The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that since this memorandum had been submitted the matter had beendiscussed further between the officials of the Departments concerned.An arrangement had now been arrived at which was satisfactory tothe officials of all the Departments affected, although in the time available it had not been practicable to consult all the ministers concerned.Broadly, the arrangement was that a freezing order would be imposed on part-time volunteers in Civil Defence Services, but thatsuch volunteers would be entitled to tender their resignationswithin a fortnight of the imposition of the Order. The date of release of those who resigned would depend on the state of theservice and the particular locality. In some cases they might be released immediately, but in others they would have to wait untilsuitable arrangements had been made to fill their places by meansof trained substitutes. He thought that he ought to broadcast anappeal in order to sustain interest in the work done by part-timersin the Civil Defence Services. He also proposed that the regional commissioners should keep a watch over the working of thisarrangement in order to ensure that it was neither too rigidly nortoo loosely administered.The War Cabinet approved the scheme outlined by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security.Canada.Financialarrangementbetween UnitedKingdom and canada.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 3rdConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a telegram hadbeen sent to the Canadian Government on the lines authorised bythe War Cabinet at their last meeting. From telegrams which hadbeen received; it was clear that the Canadian Government did not accept, and, indeed, did not appear to appreciate at all, our viewthat it was entirely wrong for one Empire Government to askcollateral security from another. They had expressed great disappointment at our reaction, and had said that they could not get agreement to a free contribution of 1,000 million dollars to coverour future expenditure in Canada unless we agreed to givecollateral security for the loan representing our expenditure up todate. Both from the political and from the financial point of view,it was necessary to consider if some compromise could be suggested.We clearly wished to avoid a breakdown in the discussions, for itwould be sure to become known to the public that the Canadian offerhad been made and that we had regarded it as unacceptable.Though our refusal to give collateral security to Canada when wehad given it to the United States while she was a neutral was very fully justified, no doubt the effect on Canadian public opinion of theoffer having been made and refused would be such as we should certainly wish to avoid.From the financial point of view, if the present offer was not accepted, we might very likely be pressed to vest the Canadian dollarsecurities which we were unwilling to pledge as collateral, and, ifwe were not prepared to do so, an awkward situation would arise.The underlying motive on the part of Canadian Ministers very likely was that they did not want us to sell or pledge Canadiandollar securities to the United States. We could meet them on thisby what was often called a &quot;negative pledge,&quot; i.e., an under-taking that Canadian dollar securities owned in this country wouldneither be sold nor pledged except in agreement with the canadian government. Further, we could undertake that, if any securitieswere sold, the proceeds would be applied to reduce the amount ofthe loan.   We could, however, only give a firm undertaking so long
as our Exchange Control Regulations were in force,: and ourpresent powers would lapse after the end of the war. We could not contemplate obtaining special powers from Parliament now,- so thatat the most we could only promise further discussion with theCanadian Government as to the position when our war-timeExchange Control powers had lapsed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that he had discussed the position with the Dominions Secretary, who had asked him tosay that he (the Dominions Secretary) was in entire agreement withhim that our reply should be to propose some kind of negative pledgein a form which would go as far as possible towards meeting theCanadian point of view without constituting the pledge of collateralsecurity in a way which would cast reflection on our credit andexpose us to similar proposals from other Empire countries.The War Cabinet-Approved the line of action proposed and authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Dominions Secretaryto proceed accordingly.Parliament. 9.   The Lord Privy Seal said that the Prime Minister wouldArrangements make a statement in Parliament at a fairly early date after hisfor the Prime return.  It was suggested that the Prime Minister should first makeMinister^ a statement, and that an adjournment motion should then be movedstatement after so that the Prime Minister would be in a position to reply,liis return. General agreement was expressed with this proposal.Suggested The Lord Privy Seal added that the Prime Minister wished toBroadcasting. avoid the strain of making a statement in Parliament and a(Previous broadcast on the same day.   This raised the question whether his reference: statement on this occasion could be recorded and subsequentlyW.M. (40) 120th broadcast.Conclusions, Discussion showed that, while the War Cabinet was determinedMinute 13.) that the Prime Minister ought not to undergo the strain of makinga statement in the House and also broadcasting on the same day, the wisdom of recording the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the house was doubted. There was the difficulty of dealing with possibleinterjections. Again, once a statement in the House had been recorded and broadcast, it would be difficult to refuse the request that other speeches should be broadcast. The broadcasting of, theproceedings of Parliament generally was strongly deprecated.Further, statements in the House were usually longer and of adifferent character from broadcast speeches. It was also felt thatthere was no real reason why the Prime Minister&apos;s broadcast shouldnot be delayed until some days after his return.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to reply in this sense to thePrime Minister.(2) Invited the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury toinform certain leading members of the House that thequestion whether the Prime Ministers statement, on his return from the United States, should be recorded hadbeen considered by the War Cabinet, who had decided against this course.Great George Street, S.W. 1,January 12, 1942. . . :...:
W.M. (42) 4.13th January, l$4g*THE LORD PRIVY SEAL informed the War Cabinet thatthe Prime Minister of Burma, U-saw, had &quot;been in touch withSaw. the Japanese Legation since Japan had come into the war,and that there was clear evidence that he&quot;: had &quot;been guilty of treachery. The evidence, however, being obtained fromsecret sources,  could not be used publicly.Arrangements were being made to prevent U-Saw fromreturning to Burma, and for   him to be detained at Tiberias,after leaving Egypt.   The arrangements for his detentionwere in the hands of the Minister of State.A political difficulty arose from the fact that the parliament in Burma was due to meet that week, although itwas hoped, to make arrangements to postpone the meeting.It would be necessary to form a new Ministry.There was also the   consideration that it would bevery embarrassing to keep U-Saw in custody without bringinghim to trial.   It was of the utmost importance, therefore,to strain every effort to obtain evidence which could beused in public.TOIA. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL informed the Y/ar Cabinet of the gist of telegram GREY 255, in   which he urged the danger of raising Constitutional issues or of making constitutional changes in India at the moment when the enemy was at thefrontier.The Lord Privy Seal also informed the War cabinet of the reply which he had sent to TAUT Wo .444 (NOCOP), tothe effect that we would not raise Indian constitutional questions in   the Prime Minister&apos;s absence,   but that thesubject was very much alive in this country and would beraised in the House before long.
