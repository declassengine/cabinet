Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 9thConclusions,Minute 1.)The middle east.The Far East.1.   The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports :-In the Middle East theatre of operations, General Rommelhad delivered a counter-stroke on the Agheila front, which might beno more than a reconnaissance in force, which had driven ouroutposts in about ten miles.On the Malayan front we had launched attacks to join up withthe forces (one brigade and two battalions) which had been cut off by the enemy&apos;s advance in the neighbourhood of Perit Sulong.Information was given of the progress made in sending air reinforcements to Malaya.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Far Bast. 2.   The War Cabinet was informed that a telegram had beenAllied received from the Prime Minister of Australia (No. 68, Personal,Co-ordination to the Prime Minister) stating that the Australian Government did(Previous not agree with the proposed Far Eastern Council in London andEeference: desired representation on a Pacific War Council to be set up in w.M. (42) 7th Washington.    The Australian Government also  asked if  an conclusions, accredited representative of the Commonwealth Government coujdMinute 5.) have the right to be heard in the War Cabinet in the formulationand direction of policy.The Prime Minister said that these requests had beenconsidered by Ministers on the previous night. It was clear thatthe Australian Government were determined to press the suggestion of obtaining a representation in Washington and that the wisestcourse was not to oppose their wishes. He doubted whether inpractice the Australian Government would find such arrangementssatisfactory.Accordingly, a brief reply had been sent on the previous nightto the following effect: *(1) The  Australian   Government   had   misunderstood   thecharacter of the proposed Far Eastern Council.(2) We agreed to their request that a representative of theCommonwealth Government should have the right to be heard in the War Cabinet in the formulation and direction of policy.&apos; (3) Did the Australian Government intend themselves to bring their proposal for a representation on a Pacific WarCouncil in Washington before the United StatesGovernment, or did they wish us to transmit it on their behalf?The suggestion was made that, as the Australian Governmenthad misunderstood our proposals, it would be desirable to give thema further explanation. The view taken was that it would be wisestto wait, say, two days before sending any further communication.The Foreign Secretary said that he thought the Dutch Govern-ment would be content with the arrangements proposed, providedthat Annex II to the Directive to General Wavell was modified to conform more closely with the terms of the telegrams which thePrime Minister had subsequently despatched to the Governmentsof Australia and New Zealand explaining how the Far EasternCouncil in London would work.[23375] 5 b 2
The Dominions.Arrangementsforconsultationwith DominionGovernments;.NorthernIreland.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 8thConclusions,Minute 1.)St. Pierre andMiquelon.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 9thConclusions,Minute 5.)Egypt.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 96thConclusions,Minute 1.)The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the reply sent by the Prime Minister to the PrimeMinister of Australia.(2) Invited the Dominions Secretary to prepare a statement for despatch to the Prime Minister of New Zealandexplaining how the Far Eastern Council would work,and repeating to him telegram No. 68 from the PrimeMinister of Australia and the Prime Ministers replythereto.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for a revised draftof Annex II to General wavell&apos;s Directive to be pre-pared by officers of his Department in consultation withthe War Cabinet Secretariat.3. The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (42) 29 and 30).The main point in the first Paper was a proposal that, ifAustralia wished to have the right to attend the War Cabinet inLondon on all occasions when questions affecting the war as a whole were being discussed, this right should be granted to her. This hadbeen overtaken by the answer which had already been given,acceding to the request of the Australian Government that anaccredited representative of that Government should have the rightto be heard in the War Cabinet in the formulation and directionof policy (see minute 2).The War Cabinet-Appointed The Minister of Supply,The Minister of Labour and National Service,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for India and Secretary ofState for Burma,as a Committee to examine the proposals contained in w.P. (42) 30 and to frame recommendations for considera-tion at their meeting on Monday, the 26th January.4. A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.5. The Prime Minister said that he had just had a longinterview with General de Gaulle, who had agreed to the issue ofthe proposed communique without the conclusion of any formalprivate agreement.If questions were asked in Parliament as to what Governmentexercised sovereignty in these Islands, it would be necessary to avoid giving a definite answer.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.6. The Foreign Secretary said that some little time ago theEgyptian Foreign Secretary had, at our instigation, requested the representative of the Vichy Government at Cairo to leave thecountry. As a result of this action, he had been severelyreprimanded by King Farouk. Sir Miles Lampson thought thatthis matter should be taken up with the King, who should at thesame time be requested to dismiss certain undesirable elements inhis household. , -
Burma.U Saw.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 8thConclusions,Minute 3.)Fighting and civil defence services.Post-WarCredits.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 110thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for burma to make arrangements that the forthcoming examination of U Sawshould be conducted in such a manner as not to preclude the possi-bility of his being put on trial at a later date.8. The War Cabinet had before them a Report of a WarCabinet Committee (W.P. (42) 26) in which they proposed-(1) That compulsory allotments from the pay of members ofthe Forces claiming allowances for wives or otherdependants should be reduced by 3s. Qd. per week. this had the effect of an increase in pay of 6d. per dayconfined to men with dependants.(2) That all children&apos;s allowances should be increased by Is.per week.(3) That allowances to dependants other than wives andchildren should be increased by Is. per week, with theexception of the case of the &apos;&apos; lone &apos;&apos; dependant alreadyreceiving 25s. per week.(4) That no adjustments should be made in basic pay, in the wife&apos;s allowance, or in the pay or allowances of officers.The War Service Grants Scheme should continue in itspresent form.(5) That an announcement should be made that a post-warnest-egg will be provided for &apos;&apos; other ranks and ratings &apos;&apos;by the crediting of Qd. per day of service from the1st April, 1942, to each individual, the credit to be madeavailable to him after the war; and that this proposal should not prejudice the case for a post-war gratuity onappropriate lines.In discussion, it was pointed out that complaints might beanticipated owing to the fact that persons who had already been discharged from the Services since the outbreak of the war wouldnot benefit from this scheme. But it was agreed that it wasimpossible to make the scheme retrospective to cover such people.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals summarised above, and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to consult with the service ministers as to the detailed measures necessary to giveeffect to them.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss with theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security thedetails of the extension to Civil Defence Services ofthe arrangements proposed for post-war credits andconsequential matters affecting Civil Defence pay. 7,&apos; (3) Agreed that the Prime Minister should state, in reply toa Parliamentary Question, that an announcement of the, : : Governments decision in regard to the matters dealtwith in the Memorandum would be made on a certainThis course was recommended by the authorities on the spot,who thought that the King would fall in with our requests. he himself agreed with it, but he felt that he should warn the Cabinetthat there remained the possibility that trouble might ensue.The War Cabinet-Invited  the  Foreign  Secretary to request  Sir miles lampson to act in the manner proposed.

On the date in question the Chancellor would make an oral state-ment, which would be followed by the issue of a white paper giving details of the scheme.9. The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs hoped that evening to settle the final details regarding the Canadian Governments proposals about this country&apos;s present and future indebtedness to Canada.It was proposed that the Governor-General should make briefreferences to the matter in his Speech from the Throne, and thatMr. Mackenzie King should make a detailed statement in theCanadian House of Commons on Monday next. He suggested thatthe Prime Minister might refer to the generous manner in whichthe Canadian Government had behaved in this matter in his speech on the following Tuesday.The Prime Minister agreed to the Chancellor of theExchequer^ proposal and invited him to supply him with thenecessary particulars. It was for consideration whether the house should be asked to make an appropriate acknowledgment of theCanadian Governments action.Parliament.SuggestedReduction of salaries ofMembers ofParliament and ministers.10. The War Cabinet agreed that a question by Sir WaldronSmithers, M.P., suggesting that the salaries of Members ofParliament be reduced to  300 a year in accordance with the precedent in 1931, and those of Ministers proportionately reducedexcept in cases of real hardship, should be answered by theChancellor of the Exchequer as follows .-That it was not proposed to make any alteration, since thebulk of the Hon. Member&apos;s purpose had been already achieved by the present heavy rates of taxation.Parliament.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 8thConclusions,Minute 2.)11. Reference was made to an unauthorised statement in thePress that morning purporting to give a report of a meeting of the1922 Committee, at which there had been discussion on the questionwhether the Government should put down a Vote of Confidence inthe Debate in the House in the following week.The War Cabinet were informed that there was a certainsection of opinion in the House which, while supporting the Govern-ment, wished to make various criticisms in the Debate, and feared that their action in doing so might be made difficult if a Vote ofConfidence was put down.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was that, while the PrimeMinister should make his first statement on Tuesday on the motion for the Adjournment of the House, he should indicate that a vote of Confidence would be moved later in the Debate. It would bemade clear that the reason for this course was that a Debateextending over three days, in which no doubt a number of criticismswould be voiced, was otherwise apt to give a wholly misleading impression abroad of the degree of support which the Governmentenjoyed in Parliament and in the country; and that this course wasin no way intended to prevent Members, who were supporters of theGovernment, from voicing reasonable criticism.It was also agreed that a Government spokesman should speakearly on the second and third days of the Debate. The choice ofMinisters to speak would, however, have to be left until later.
