The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in.amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 905-911 : In the Home Theatre low cloud and fog had impeded our bomber operations. During the previous seven days we had lost;24 aircraft and the enemy had lost 2.In Libya the enemy had been more active and we had had anumber of machines destroyed, and 26 damaged, on the ground.At Malta, where there had been 50 raids during the previousweek, we had lost 9 machines (5 on the ground) to 5 of the enemy.In the Dutch East Indies we had lost 26 destroyed (15 on theground) and the enemy 19. In this area the Allied air forces had sunk 6 Japanese transports and hit 9 and damaged 1 cruiser.In Burma we had lost 11 machines (5 on the ground) and theenemy had lost 63 machines.Details were given of the successful raid on the German Radio-location post at Bruneval on the night of the 27th/28th February.During the previous week 84,000 tons of shipping had been lost.The total losses for February amounted to 366,000 tons for certain,but this figure might be increased to 525,000 tons.In a naval action off Java on the 27th February 2 Dutchcruisers and 2 of our destroyers had been sunk. The Exeterhad been damaged and the Japanese had since claimed to have sunkher, together with the 2 destroyers acting as escort. The enemy losses were estimated at 1 8-inch cruiser sunk, 1 8-inch cruiserdamaged and 1 destroyer sunk. A number of Japanese transportswere claimed to have been sunk, but exact details had not yet beenreceived.Information regarding the withdrawal of our forces to theSittang River was incomplete, but it seemed that the fighting hadbeen heavy with considerable casualties on both sides.General Wavell had now arrived on this front and had madenew dispositions.Details were given of the administrative position in the eventof the loss of Rangoon. The whole question of communications between India, Burma and China was being examined.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the petrolposition in China was serious and enquiries were being made regarding the possibility of sending supplies of petrol to Chinafrom Russia.Three main Japanese landings had been made on Java on the night of the 28th February/1st March.      ^Details were given of the number of British and australian troops now on the Island.The Minister of Information was invited to warn the press that we could not expect to put up any long resistance in Java.Some discussion took place on the adequacy of our arrange-ments in Libya for the repair of tanks. The Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff was asked to inform the Prime Minister of thecircumstances in which it had become known that a large numberof tanks could be made operative if spare parts were sent out by air.The Russians had. made a forward move south of Leningrad.The German forces in the area of Demyansk were liable to be cutoff. Heavy fighting had taken place east of Smolensk. The twosalients formed in the Donets area denoted a further Russianpenetration of the German defences. In the Crimea heavy fightinghad been going on, but the results were not known.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.[23527]
Ceylon.    &apos; 2.   The War Cabinet were informed that consideration had proposed been given to the appointment of a Military Governor of Ceylon.Appointment of who would have control over the military forces and the Civila Military Administration of the Island. The latter would presumably beGovernor. carried on under the immediate direction of the existing civil authorities subject to the overriding authority vested in the newMilitary Governor.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the appointment of a military governor at Ceylon, as a matter of urgency.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to make thenecessary arrangements in this matter, in consultationwith the&apos; Chiefs of Staff.Hong Kong.Treatment ofPrisoners at.Question of publicity.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 23rdConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The War Cabinet were informed that a telegram had nowbeen received from the Viceroy proposing the publication of a very short statement stressing the fact that Japan had not allowedrepresentatives of the International Red Cross or of the protecting power to visit prisoners&apos; camps in Hong Kong.The Foreign Secretary said that the Argentine Government,who were representing British interest vis-a-vis the Japanese,seemed unlikely to take any effective action to mitigate the present condition of prisoners at Hong Kong pending some authoritativepublic statement as to the deprivations ind sufferings of the prisoners.On the other hand, the view was expressed that it was undesirable to publish a statement until all possible steps had beentaken to verify the allegations made.The War Cabinet-Asked that this matter should again be brought forward for consideration on the following Thursday; and in themeantime invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for thematter to be further discussed inter-departmentally.RegionalUnderstandings-Belgium, TheNetherlands andLuxemburg.4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by ti1Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 99). The BelgianGovernment had recently asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould look with favour upon an agreement between Belgium, theNetherlands and Luxemburg with the object of co-ordinating more closely the foreign, military and economic policies of the three countries. In view of the fact that the Belgians had already expressed the wish to be closely associated with ourselves after thewar and the undesirability of ventilating the idea before the mainlines of Anglo-United States economic policy had been fixed, theForeign Secretary proposed to tell the Belgian Government that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be&apos;disposed to look with favour upon such an agreement, without, however, giving the impression that wewere particularly enthusiastic about the proposal as it stood.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.
Great George Street, S. W. 1,March 2, 1942.* Hansard, col. 314^Entertainments.       5.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by .the(Previous Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (42) 101)Reference: . setting out present policy with regard to entertainments, and askingW.M. (41) 64th whether, in view of the statement by the Lord Privy Seal in theConclusions, House of Commons on the 25th February, * entertainments should be minute 8.) still further restricted.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gavedetails of the progressive measures introduced since the war to&quot;restrict race meetings, &amp;c, and informed the War Cabinet that discussions were in progress for a further reduction.In discussion, it was agreed that recreation was essential for those taking their share in the war effort, and that there must be no interference with due facilities to this end. Further, there shouldbe no discrimination between different forms of sport. It was thought, however, that, without making any such discrimination, itwould be reasonable to restrict greyhound racing to Saturdayafternoons and to general public holidays (e.g., Bank Holidays).On the other hand, it was generally agreed that public opinionhad been shocked by the large gatherings at certain forms of enter-tainment of a somewhat spectacular nature. In particular, publicopinion was offended by the sight of large assemblies of motor carsat sports gatherings. This latter aspect of the question, however,might be disposed of if effect was to be given to the proposal understood to be under consideration by the Petroleum Depart-ment to abolish the basic ration.The War Cabinefs Conclusions were as follows  (1) While no change was called for in the general policyhitherto pursued, the present situation called for some further intensification of that policy, e.g., by reducingstill further the number of race meetings, &amp;c, held.(2) In particular, the Home Secretary should direct actionagainst spectacular displays which gave offence to publicopinion, more especially if these displays gave rise to large assemblies of motor cars.(3) The Home Secretary should be invested with such further powers as might be necessary to carry out this policy,and, in particular, to put a stop to the proposal (referredto in paragraph 16 of his Memorandum) to open a newgreyhound racing track.
