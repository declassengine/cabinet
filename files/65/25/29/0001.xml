Palestine. 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the illegal Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (42) 108) about illegal immigration. immigration into Palestine.  The Colonial Secretary suggested that Previous We ^a(^ to cnoose between (1) standing pat op our present positionReference h a c * refusing to budge, and (2) admitting illegal immigrants so longWM (42) 21st as their numbers were deducted from the annual quota and so long&quot; , . as the quota was not&apos;exceeded.-Conclusions, nMinute 11.) Points made in discussion(1) It was the policy of the Roumanian Government to expelJews from their country. There was, therefore, a grave risk that, if we agreed to admit to Palestine illegal immigrants fleeing from enemy oppression,, even ifsubject to the conditions suggested by the colonial secretary, the influx Would soon reach large proportions.Apart from security reasons, it was very undesirable to weaken the present ban on illegal immigration.(2) The alternative of arranging for J wish refugees from, say,Roumania to be sent to Mauritius presented difficulties,on account of shortage of shipping.(3) We should endeavour to ensure that the wider issues of thepolicy laid down in the White Paper of 1939 were notraised by the difficulties which had arisen from two orthree shiploads of illegal immigrants; more especially since at the moment there was no shipload of immigrantswhich called for a decision,(4) Nevertheless, we should ag^ain be faced with an awkwardissue when the next shipload of illegal immigrants; reached Istanbul, and we were asked whether we would-  agree to the ship proceeding to Palestine.The War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were as fellows : (a) It was undesirable to raise the wider issues of the policy laid down in the White Paper of 1939. Further, weshould endeavour to avoid any general pronouncementon immigration at the present time.(6) All practicable steps should be taken to discourage illegal immigration into Palestine. Any illegal jewish immigrants who, notwithstanding these steps, reachedPalestine should be treated with humanity. Theyshould be kept in internment camps, unless and untilarrangements could be made for them to be shipped off to some other destination;&apos; e.g,, technicians might be sentto Eritrea, where useful employment could be found, forthem; and opportunities might be found to send others to Mauritius.(c) The Colonial Secretary was. invited to bring, the matter again before the War Cabinet on the next occasion when a shipload of refugees from enemy-occupied territoriesreached Istanbul and we were asked whether we would agree to let them into Palestine. But nothing shouldbe said in the meantime to encourage the view that sucha request would be granted. .Free France. 2.   The Foreign Secretary reported that he had had a long(Previous interview with General de Gaulle, who had said that he had reference -. decided to replace Admiral Muselier as National Commissioner for w.M. (41) 97th tne Free French Navy, and Commander-in-Chief of the Free FrenchConclusions Naval Forces, by Admiral Auboyneau. Admiral Muselier had minute 5:)&apos;      resigned from the former post.The War Cabinet were given details by the Foreign secretary and the First Lord of the Admiralty of the course of events whichhad led up to this situation.
Hong Kong.Treatment ofPrisoners. -Question of publicity.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 26thConclusions,Minute 3.)India.(Previous     1Reference:W.M. (42) 29thConclusions,Minute 3.)The - War Cabinet, after considering various alternative courses- , * .Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform General de Gaullethat, while we would not insist upon Admiral Muselierremaining a member of the Free French national committee, we must insist&apos; upon Admiral Muselierretaining his post of Commander-in-Chief of the free french Navy. If General de Gaulle would not agree tothis course himself, we should have to take the necessary action ourselves to make it effective.3. The War Cabinet had before them a draft Question and answer, circulated Dy the Foreign Secretary (W.P. (42) 111).The Parliamentary  Under-Secretary of State for Foreignan Inter-Departmental Meeting, was based on statements fromMiss Harrap, of the Office of the Commissioner of Police at HongKong, and a Lieut.-Colonel of the R.A.M.C.,&apos; who had bothescaped.   There was also some support for the draft Answer in a &apos;report of the Domei Agency, published in Tokyo:Any statement on the subject would cause some anxiety amongthe relations of the prisoners. The views of those present at themeeting had been that, if any statement was made, it should be afull statement giving details as to the outrages, which would shockpublic opinion. Only in this way was there any hope of remedyingthe position.The United States authorities raised ncobjection to Our makinga statement on these lines.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theHigh Commissioners, at their meeting with him that afternoon, hadfavoured a statement on the lines of the draft Answer.The War Cabinet (i) Approved the draft statement and asked the foreign secretary to give it in answer to a parliamentary question on Tuesday, the 10th March,(ii) Agreed that no names of the victims of outrages should beincluded in the statement, [But an amendment mightbe made to make it clear that the statement in the first sentence of the third paragraph did not relate to canadian Officers.]4. The War Cabinet-Invited the India Committee to hold a further Meeting, atwhich consideration should be given to the points raised at the Meeting of Ministers held at 12 noon that day, and&apos; to report to a Special Meeting of the War Cabinet to beheld on Monday, the 9th March, at 12 noon.Great George Street, S.W. 1,March 5, 1942.
