The enemy&apos;s anti-aircraft fire had been heavier than on any earlier occasion.   &apos;The shipping losses during the previous four days amounted toabout 9,000 tons. This included one British vessel of 1,500 tonsand! two United States vessels. The total shipping losses for themonth were estimated, on the basis of the available reports, at215,000 tons. There would be some losses in the Far EasternTheatre to add to this.There had been tank battles in the neighbourhood of Jedabyaon the 28th December and the 30th December. The casualties on both sides were likely to be heavy. Owing to the long line of communications, we could at present only maintain comparatively,small armoured formations at the front, but it was hoped that thesupply facilities would be improved before long.In the frontier area the assault on Bardia had begun theprevious morning.The situation of Manila appeared to be grave. There was little change in Malaya. On the East Coast of Malaya a small party of japanese had penetrated southwards towards Kuan tan, where theyW re being engaged. On the West Coast we were in contact withthe enemy south of Ipoh. i;. We had little news beyond press reports. The Russian offen-sive in the Crimea appeared to be developing satisfactorily.

Sir Earle Page said that the Australian Government1 werenotprepared to say unconditionally that they would&apos; withdraw their troops on the arrival of the Portuguese. Could 700 Portuguese beregarded as an adequate garrison in all contingencies ? The Ghiefof the Imperial General Staff said that it would take some time for australian and Dutch forces to get back to Dilli, once they had been withdrawn. oca\\The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs said that We were planning to recall the British Ambassador in Lisbon for consUlta-tions in London. At the same time, the Portuguese were planning to recall their Ambassador in this country for consultations inLisbon. Both Ambassadors should not be absent from their postssimultaneously; he had therefore instructed Sir Ronald Campbellonly to come home if Dr. Monteiro&apos;s visit to Lisbon were put off.The Foreign Secretary added that he doubted whether theAustralian Government had fully appreciated the practicaldisadvantages which we should incur if there were a rupture of relations between ourselves and Portugal. It might be desirableto send a communication to the Australian Government on thispoint.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,Sir Earle Page and a representative of the Foreign Officeto confer on this aspect of the situation.U.S.S.R.Visit of theSecretary ofState forForeign affairs to Moscow.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a state-ment on his visit to Moscow. A record of this statement is containedin the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.U.S.S.R. 5.   The Minister of Labour and National Service raised theSupply of question of the order of priority to be given to certain orders forElectrical heavy electrical equipment, which had been placed with the tradeEquipment. by the Soviet Trade Delegation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that this.matter had been raised at the Allied Supplies Committee on the previous day. The order involved some 10,000 tons of steel and might meancutting down the allocations of steel made to our own supplyprogrammes. The Ministry of Supply had been asked as a first stepto explain to the Soviet Trade Delegation the difficulties ofproviding the material involved.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service todiscuss the matter with Colonel Llewellin.tlon &quot; for Lease-Lend Aid.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 81stConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Minister without Portfolio reminded the War cabinet of the position in this matter. The United States Government didnot intend to ask for payment for articles passing to us under the lease-Lend Procedure. They proposed, however, that Article VIIof the proposed Lease-Lend Agreement should provide that theterms and conditions upon which this country received Lease-Lendaid from the United States of America should include provision foragreed action to promote advantageous economic relations betweenthe two countries and for the betterment of world-wide economic
relations. The United States Grovernment wished the form of wordsused in this respect to include a provision against discriminatorytreatment in international commerce and had made it clear that bythat phrase they intended that we should commit ourselves to the eventual abolition of Imperial Preference.This matter had, of course, been touched on in Article IV ofthe Atlantic Charter. The words there used had, however, beensafeguarded by &quot; due respect for .... existing obligations.&quot;The revised draft of Article VII of the proposed Lease-LendAgreement handed to our Ambassador at Washington on the2nd December referred to &apos;&apos; the elimination of all forms of discrimination -natory treatment in international commerce&apos;&apos; and to &apos;&apos; thereduction of tariffs and other trade barriers.&apos;&quot;&apos;This matter had been discussed on the 23rd December at ameeting of the Committee on Economic Aspects of EeconstructionProblems.* The Committee had also had before them certaintelegrams explaining in some detail the interpretation which theUnited States authorities placed on the revised draft ofArticle VII. At this meeting Ministers had agreed that a telegram should be sent to our Ambassador in Washington to the effect that difficulties were seen in accepting the revised draft of Article VII;but that the case might be different if an agreed interpretation ofthe article could be arrived at which could be made public if theneed arose. It had been suggested that our Ambassador should discuss with the Prime Minister the practicability of securing suchan agreed interpretation.A further telegram had now been received from Washington(No. 6105 of the 29th December, 1941) indicating that the PrimeMinister had not been able to deal with the matter, owing to the pressure of other business. This telegram also reported thatMr. Hull had asked when we should be able to reply, since he wouldbe obliged to make a statement on the matter before Congress not later than mid-January, when it was proposed to ask Congress to vote further Lease-Lend appropriations.The Minister without Portfolio said that a further meeting ofMinisters had been held at short notice on the previous night. after some discussion, it had been decided to telegraph to the Ambassador,for his private information, that after careful discussion herebetween Ministers it was felt that this matter, on which divergentviews were held, must await the Prime Ministers return beforefurther instructions could be sent to him (Lord Halifax).The War Cabinet-Agreed that a telegram should be despatched on these lines.Great George Street, S.W. 1,January 1, 1942.E.R.P. (41) 4th Meeting.
