The First Lord of the Admiralty raised the questionwhether the Debate on the shipping situation which was due totake place on Wednesday, the 11th February, should take place in secret Session.The War Cabinet-Decided that, as it was impossible to deal with the matteradequately in public Session, the Debate should take placein secret; and authorised the Joint parliamentary secretary to the Treasury to arrange for the Debate to takeplace in Secret Session.agricultural prices.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 291stConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the lord president of the Council and by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (W.P. (42) 41 and 49).After a discussion, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions, the War cabinet decided as follows : (1) The total price increases considered necessary to fulfil theGovernment&apos;s pledge should not exceed  20 million.1. The War Cabinet had before them a further Report(W.P. (42) 60) from the Committee on Post-War Credits, which had met to consider the suggestions : (a) That the post-war credit proposals should be amended by making the amount to be set aside Is. per day of service,instead of 6^.;(6) That the credit should accrue as from the same date as theincome-tax concession, to which it was analogous; and(c) That the credit should be alternative and not additional toany war gratuity that might be decided upon, theindividual having the option of drawing whichever was more favourable to him.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Committee had considered these suggestions. He summarised the reasons (set outin the Report) why they had come to the conclusion that theproposals as originally approved by the War Cabinet should be adhered to, subject to the adoption of the 1st January, 1942, as thedate from which the post-war credit should accumulate.The War Cabinet-(a) Agreed that the amount to be set aside should be 6d. a day(4d. in the case of women) as previously approved bythe War Cabinet.(b) Agreed that post-war credits should begin to accumulate asfrom the 1st January, 1942.(c) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to add a sentenceto the statement which it was proposed should be madein the House of Commons, to make it clear that the post-war credits would be separate from any gratuities whichmight be authorised for members of the Forces afterthe war.
(2) This decision took no account of the allocation of this sumbetween the various commodities, a question which hadnot yet been fully considered.[Some Ministers expressed the view that the alloca-tion of this sum involved questions of high policy.](3) Paragraph 8 of the Memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (setting out various matters which shouldbe communicated to the farmers&apos; representatives) was endorsed.Great George Street, S.W. 1,February 4, 1942.
