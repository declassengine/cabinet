Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 19thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Far East.1. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a telegramfrom General Wavell, of the 11th February (0820Z), reporting theposition in Singapore.Naval Situation.In the course of the Meeting the War Cabinet was informed bythe First Lord of the Admiralty, and later by the Chief of the AirStaff, that the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had left Brest and weresteaming up-Channel, surrounded by a number of vessels believed tobe E-Boats and destroyers. - -The War Cabinet were informed in outline of the plans madefor air attacks on the enemy ships.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The Far East.The Far EastWar Council.Command inthe A.B.D.A.Area.China.2. The Prime Minister said that the question had been raised whether China should have a representative ori the Pacific WarCouncil, which had now been established in London and had heldits first meeting on Tuesday, the 10th February. He had how heard that the United States Government saw no objection to this course.He proposed to send a telegram to General Chiang Kai-shek sayingthat we hoped that the Generalissimo would appoint a representa-tive of China to sit on the Council.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of this course.The Prime Minister said that the President had asked whether,in view of the possibly unfavourable effect on the United Statespublic of an announcement that the Naval Command was passingfrom the United States to the Dutch, the public announcement ofthe appointment of Air Marshal Peirse as Commander, of the combined A.B.D.A. Air Force could be postponed.The War Cabinet-Agreed that, in all the circumstances, an announcement ofthis appointment should be postponed for the present.The Prime Minister said that he had received a telegram from field-Marshal Dill enclosing the draft of a message of encourage-ment which it was suggested that he (the Prime Minister) should send to General Chiang Kai-shek.The War Cabinet-   &apos;Decided that the present time was not propitious for a message of this kind, and that its terms were not altogetherappropriate and would require redrafting before it was despatched.France.Relations withthe vichy government.(previous reference:W.M.  (42) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2).3. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he hadreceived a persona! telegram from the President of the UnitedStates informing him of instructions sent to the United states representative at Vichy to make the strongest representations to marshal Petain in regard to the fact that food supplies and truckshad been shipped from France in French vessels to Tunis for the useof Axis forces in North Africa.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hopedthat it might be possible for the War Cabinet on Monday to consider what action the Admiralty should take, now that French ships were[23463]b 2
being used to provide transport and supplies to Tunis for delivery to the enemy forces in Libya. In the meantime, he suggested thatthe Minister of Information should be asked to give guidance to thePress in the sense that it was undesirable to give great prominenceto this matter at the present time. To do so might involve us in difficulties unless we were, in fact, able to take effective action toput a stop to this traffic.The War Cabinet agreed with this suggestion.Considerationunder Lease-Lend.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 17thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a PersonalDespatch which he had received from the President of the UnitedStates in regard to Article 7 of the Interim Lease-Lend Agreement.The Presidents despatch showed a full appreciation of the objec-tions which we had felt to signing the proposed Agreement. In his view, Article 7 contained no commitment in advance to abolishEmpire Preference, which should be excluded from our discussions.An exchange of notes would, however, seem very cautious. he hoped we would see our way to sign the Agreement without an exchange of Notes on the assurances now given.The War Cabinet-Expressed satisfaction at the terms of this document, butdeferred a final decision until the Ministers concerned had had time to give further consideration to the, matter.Note. Subsequent to the Meeting, and after consultationwith the Ministers concerned, the Prime Minister sent a telegram to President Roosevelt, in which he announced that, subject, to theconsent of the Dominions, we would sign the proposed Agreement,without a formal interchange of letters. If asked, he (the PrimeMinister) would state his view of the public document from his ownstandpoint, but would not quote from the Presidents personaldespatch.-Agricultural -Prices. .(previous reference:W.M. (42) 15thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Minute to the PrimeMinister from the Lord President of the Council, to which was appended a Schedule of Price Increases showing the proposed allocation of the sum of  20 millions, which the War Cabinet had decided was the amount necessary to fulfil the Governments pledge(W.P. (42) 75).The Lord President of the Council explained that, in his view,the schedule represented the best distribution which could be made,if regard was paid both to the interests of agricultural policy andto the priorities of food production to which the Minister of Foodattached importance. He gave explanations, on the lines set out inhis Minute, about the prices on which there had been some difference of opinion, with the reasons which had influenced him in reachinghis conclusions.The Minister of Food said that, while he accepted the PriceSchedule, he wished it, to be on record that he thought he wouldhave to ask for some further inducement, in order to ensure that asufficient number of eggs were sent to packing&apos; stations. failing this, he feared that he would not be able to ensure a satisfactorydistribution of the available eggs.The Minister of Agriculture and. Fisheries aaid that, subject tothe points on which there had been differences of opinion, and whichwere set out in the Lord Presidents Minute, he accepted.-thedistribution as the: best which couM /be effected within the limit
:,v; 105 W.M. 20 (412).fixed by the War Cabinet. He was ready to put the schedule to the farmers&apos; representatives with all the emphasis at his command, as representing the War Cabinet&apos;s decision as to what constituted afair schedule of price increases in present circumstances. He would do all in his power to obtain acceptance of these increases. he assumed, however, that, if the farmers&apos; representatives producedan overwhelmingly strong case on any particular item, he couldreport their representations to the War Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that the Government must, of course,retain discretion to consider any new facts brought to their notice.It must, however, be clearly understood that nothing should be said which implied that there was any likelihood that the Governmentwould be willing to consider a schedule of price increases which involved a larger total sum than the aggregate price increases recommended by the Lord President of the Council, namely, 20-314millions.*The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, from the point ofview of the Exchequer, this was most important. The sum now inquestion was considerably larger than he thought oughtto beaccepted, on the merits of the case.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he accepted the,price schedule. He hoped that it would be possible to obtain-an7agreed settlement on this basis. The one point on which he feltuneasy was that no price increase was proposed for eggs. So faras mixed farmers were concerned, it could be argued that they wereobtaining increases on other commodities. But it would bedifficult to persuade the egg specialists that the pledge had beenfulfilled in their case if there was no increase in the price of eggs.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the Schedule of Price Increases appended to theLord President&apos;s Minute, and authorised the ministers in charge of the Agricultural Departments to make thenecessary communications to the farmers&apos; representa-tives on this basis. (It was understood that, in regardto milk, no immediate announcement would be made,owing to a possible change in the method of payment.)(2) In putting the Schedule of Price Increases to the farmers&apos;representatives, regard should be had to the various points summarised in paragraph 8 of the lord presidents Memorandum (W.P. (42) 41).6. The War Cabinet gave preliminary consideration to a draft telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy aboutthe alternative draft statement which the Secretary of State forIndia had been asked to prepare at the Meeting held on the5th February. The object of this telegram was to ascertain the, , , views of the Viceroy on the general line of a proposed statement by conclusions, tne Prime Minister.Minute 3.) The War Cabinet-Agreed that, while the text would require further con-sideration, a draft telegram on the lines proposed shouldbe despatched without further reference to them.Great George Street, S.W. 1,February IS, 1942.* This figure should read  20&apos;323.millions, the price increase of 5s. per cwt.of fat cattle amounting to  2775 millions instead of  2766 millions.India.constitutional questions.(previous reference:

COPY EMBASSY OP THE UNITED STATESOF AMERICA.SECRET.12th February, 1942.My dear Mr. Churchill,I have the honour to transmit to you thefollowing despatch received from the President this date:No. 105.      &quot;For the Former Naval Person andWinant from the President in regard to the proposed exchange of notes relating to article seven of the InterimLend-Lease Agreement, referred to in your message No. 25,I want to make it perfectly clear to you that it is thefurthest thing from my mind that we are attempting in anyway to ask you to trade the principle of imperial preference as a consideration for Lend-Lease.     Further-more, I understand something of the nice relationshipsyour Constitution requires of your Home Government indealing with the Dominions.      Obviously the Dominionsmust not only be consulted but I assume you must have their!approval on any affirmative changes in existing arrangements;which might be developed in the broad discussions which you and I both contemplate.     It seems to me the proposednote leaves a clear implication that Empire Preference and,say, Agreements between ourselves and the Philippinesare excluded before we sit down at the table.     All I amurging is an understanding with you that we are going tohave a bold, forthright, and comprehensive discussionlooking forward to the construction of what you so aptlycall *a free, fertile economic policy for the post-war world&apos;.     It seems perfectly clear to me that nothing should now be excluded from those discussions.     None of us know how those discussions will turn out, although, asI told you when you were here last, I have greatconfidence that we can organise a different kind of worldwhere men shall really be free economically as well aspolitically.     The idea of attaching notes to this interimagreement would seem to ine to give an impression to our enemies that we were overly cautious.     I believe the peoples not only of our two countries but the peoples of all the world will be heartened to know that we are going to try together and with them for the organisationof a democratic post-war world and gladly accept yourintimation that we might get going at once with our economic discussion.     What seems to be bothering theCabinet is the thought that we want a commitment inadvance that Empire Preference will be abolished.     We areasking for no such commitment, and I can say that articleseven does not contain any such commitment.     I realise that that would be a commitment which your Governmentcould not give now if it wanted to.     And I am very sure that I could not, on my part, make any commitment relative to a vital revision of our t ariff policy.     I am equallysure that both of us are going to face in this realisticworld adjustments looking forward to your ?free andfertile economic policy for the post-war world1, andthat things which neither of us now dreams of will besubjects of the most serious consideration in the not toodistant future.     So nothing should be excluded from thediscussions.     Can we not, therefore, avoid the exchangeof notes which, as I have said, seems to dilute ourstatement of^urpose with cautious reservations, and sign the agreement on the assurances which I here give in reference to the matter that seems to be the stumblingblock.     I feel very strongly that this would demonstrate

to the world the unity of the American and british people.     In regard to coming to a meeting of minds with you at an early date, I only need to say to you thatthere are very important considerations here which make an early understanding desirable.     In saying this, I want again to tell you that I am not uaomindful of yourproblem.     We have tried to approach the whole matterof Lend-Lease in a manner that will not lead us intothe terrible pitfalls of the last war.&quot;Very respectfully yours,CSgdo )    H. FREEMAN MATTHEWS.
