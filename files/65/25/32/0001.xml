(42) 26thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.Shipping Losses.The Par East.MilitaryOperations.Burma.J ava.Libya.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the main events of the past week.Heavy night-bombing attacks had been carried out on theRenault works outside Paris on the night of the 3rd/4th March,and on Essen on the night of the 8th/9th March.Overseas operations included the landing of air reinforcements in Malta (where the enemy continued to deliver heavy air attacks),the sinking of two vessels in Palei&apos;mo Harbour and the landing ofair reinforcements in Ceylon.Allied shipping losses in the preceding seven days totalledabout 140,000 tons.The Allies had lost a number of warships in the A.B.D.A. area during the seven days. These included 2 British, 1 American and2 Dutch Cruisers.The Rangoon demolition scheme had been put into effect onthe 7th March, and the withdrawal of our troops from Rangoonhad followed. Our main forces from Rangoon were withdrawingin the direction of Prome. An enemy force, which had blocked theroad had been dislodged after heavy fighting.All communication with the Allied forces in Java had ceasedon the 7th March.There was little change in the Libyan theatre.No big changes had taken place on the Russian front. TheGerman forces encircled in the neighbourhood of Staraya Russawere estimated to amount to several divisions; they were still holding out, and were probably receiving supplies by air. Therewere favourable developments on the Smolensk front. The Russiansappeared to be attempting to broaden the base of the Donetssalient.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Pacific. 2.   The War Cabinet discussed the situation in the Pacific,The position of with special reference to the position of Australia. A record of theAustralia. discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.Disclosure of 3.   Reference was made to a recent speech which disclosedInformation.      information which might be of value to the enemy.The First Lord of the Admiralty was invited to examine thematter and to report to the Prime Minister.The Press.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 115thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The view was strongly expressed that the attitude ofcertain organs of the Press was gravely prejudicial to the nationalmorale. In particular, certain sections of the Press, by persistentattacks on officers holding high rank appointments, were under-mining the morale of the Army.It was also pointed out that messages were frequently sent overseas by Press Correspondents in this country which werecalculated to arouse ill feeling between this country and certain ofthe Dominions or of our Allies.Criticism was also made of the fact that it was not possible under the existing regulations to stop publication here of a messagecontaining matter which had already been published overseas. Thetime had come when Parliament should be asked for the necessary powers in order to deal with the situation.[23560-2] b 2
The War Cabinet-(i) Agreed in principle that effective control should be estab-lished to prevent the publication in this country ofarticles, or the sending out of this country of messages,calculated to undermine public morale at home, or tocreate ill feeling between the United Nations,(ii) Appointed a Committee comprising rThe Lord President (Chairman),The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Minister of Labour and National Service,The   Home   Secretary  and  Minister  of  home security,The Minister of Information, andThe Attorney-General,to examine the methods of giving effect to this decision and to report in a week&apos;s time.Hong Kong.Treatment ofPrisoners.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 29thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that further information had now been received which indicated thatour prisoners at Hong Kong were receiving rather better treatment.He had therefore considered whether it was still desirable to makethe statement in Parliament on the following day which had beenapproved by the War Cabinet on the 5th March. He had reachedthe conclusion that, while the statement should be made, a sentence should be added to the effect that there was some reason to believethat our prisoners were now receiving somewhat better treatment,but that, until the Japanese would allow representatives of the protecting Power to go to Hong Kong, we should have reason to fear the worst.The War Cabinet approved this suggestion.France- 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded theEelations with War Cabinet that it had agreed that the consent of the Unitedthe Vichy States Government should be obtained before the Note appended toGovernment. W.P. (42) 86, setting out the action which we proposed to take in(Previous retaliation for the use of French shipping for supplying Axis forcesReference: in Libya, was communicated to the Vichy Government.    TheW.M. (42) 2lst United States Government had now expressed the wish that weConclusions, should refrain from taking the action proposed for the present.Minute 4.) He (the Foreign Secretary) felt that we ought to defer to UnitedStates wishes in this matter.The War Cabinet concurred in this view.Free Prance. 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a copy of a letter from(Previous General de Gaulle to the Foreign Secretary regarding the positionReference:       of Admiral Muselier (W.P. (42) 117).W.M. (42) 29th rrrj.      v        - a -     -.Conclusions lhe Forez9n Secretary reported that, since this matter had minute 2) &apos; last been discussed in the War Cabinet, he had had several inter-views with General de Gaulle. The latter had taken the attitude that he was not prepared to acquiesce in our request that Admiral Muselier should retain his post of Commander-in-Chief of the free french Navy. It would seem that in this attitude he had thegeneral support of the Free French National Committee.
China.Supplies of petrol.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 26thConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 113) about thepossibility of sending supplies of petrol to China from Russia, and suggesting (a) that he should urge upon the Soviet Ambassador theimportance of the Soviet Government facilitating thedevelopment of supply routes to China, especially forthe carriage of petrol;(b) steps should be taken by the British Military Mission atChungking to ascertain how much petrol was containedin the accumulation dumps on the Burma Road.The War Cabinet approved the action proposed by the foreign secretary.Great Georae Street, S.W. 1,March 9, 1942.In discussion, the First Lord of the Admiralty emphasised theimportance of maintaining good discipline in the Free french navy, which was now the most powerful branch of the Free Frenchmovement. Admiral Muselier had not resigned the post of commander-in-Ghief, and the Admiralty saw no possible&apos;successorto him.After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed that the foreign secretary should take the following line with General de Gaulle : (a) We adhered to our view - that Admiral Muselier should retain his post of Commander-in-Chief of the free french Navy. We made this request speaking as oneAlly to another.(&amp;) If, however, this request was refused, we should have no alternative but to review our agreement with general de Gaulle as leader of the Free French Movement.
