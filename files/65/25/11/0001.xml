Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 10thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations :Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.Libya.1.   The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Eoom Records Nos. 870-876 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 19th January : Home Theatre Enemy 3 destroyed.2 probable.Our Own 13 bombers (out of 292 sorties).1 fighter.1 Coastal Command aircraft.Middle East Enemy 110 destroyed.8 probable.29 damaged.Our Own 26 destroyed.12 damaged.Malaya (total since beginning of operations) Enemy 99 destroyed.Our Own 103 destroyed.Burma -Enemy 101 destroyed.Our Own &apos;20 destroyed.In the Mediterranean R.A.F. machines, in co-operation withthe Fleet Air Arm, had attacked an enemy convoy on the 23rd and24th January, and had sunk one liner and probably hit two merchantvessels (although they had reached their destination) and onewarship.  One enemy destroyer had been torpedoed.The Chief of the Air Staff reported on the organisation of theGerman Air Force in the Middle East compared with our own. ThePrime Minister asked that the detailed figures might be submitted in writing.During the previous seven days 128,000 tons of shipping hadbeen lost: 78,000 tons by enemy action and 50,000 by marinecasualties.A German destroyer had been mined off Calais and one U-boatdestroyed.On the 21st January Axis Forces had advanced in some strength in two columns (a) along the Coast Road to Agedabia;(b) parallel and 20 miles inland.andOur advance forces had withdrawn and had lost a number of guns and lorries in the process. On the 22nd January one enemycolumn had wheeled south-east on Saunnu and another column had gone north. On the 24th January the enemy column at Saunnu had withdrawn south-west pursued by our armoured-car patrols.According to the latest reports, an enemy column at Antelat wasbeing engaged by the Second Armoured Brigade. The enemyclaimed to have put out of action 143 of our tanks. There had beenreports of a large enemy concentration about 60 miles due south ofMsus moving north-east. There was no indication that the enemy&apos;seffort was yet spent.[23387-1] b 2
Malaya.Burma.Philippines.Russia.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had hada discussion with General Martel, who had just returned from theMiddle East. General Martel stated that our tanks were not:inferior to the German tanks in armour, but that they were out-gunned. The Germans had mounted a 4^-pdr. in their tanks, whichhad a longer range than our 2-pdr. In consequence, our tanks werebeing hit by the German tanks while the latter was still out of range of our guns.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reminded the WarCabinet that the policy which had been adopted had been to develop a 6-pdr. gun to replace the present 2-pdr., in order to ensure thatour next tank gun would be at least comparable in power and rangewith the German gun. Unfortunately, the development of the 6-pdr.had been very slow.The Minister of Supply said that whatever might have beenthe position as regards the earlier stages of development, the outputof 6-pdr. guns in the last three or four months had been in excessof the forecast. He would like an opportunity of discussing thematter with officers of the General Staff.The Prime Minister said that he had sent a telegram to general auchinleck saying that he was somewhat disturbed at the situation,and had received a reply from General Blarney (General Auchinleckbeing at Advanced Headquarters) which was somewhat reassuring,but admitted that we had suffered a tactical reverse.During the previous week our forces had withdrawn about50 miles from a line on the River Muar to the line Mersin-Kluang-Bata Pahat. During this withdrawal two Australian battalions and one Indian brigade had been cut off near Muar on the coast.They had fought their way back to within a few miles of the main body and some 600 Australians and a number of Indian troops had now rejoined. Details were given of the reinforcements which had arrived and were shortly expected at Singapore. The Chief of theAir Staff gave details of air reinforcements expected.The Chiefs of Staff were invited to examine and report upon the possibility of sending further air reinforcements to Malaya from the Middle East.In the period the 15th-18th January the Japanese had advanced in two columns, from the south on Mergui and Tavoi, andfrom the east on Moulmein. The two first-named places had been evacuated by our forces, and we were now withdrawing westwardon Moulmein. Chinese troops had started to concentrate in theSouthern Shan States, and the Fifth Chinese Army was on the burma Road just north of the Burma-China frontier.Details were given of the air reinforcements expected to reachBurma in the near future.The Chief of the Air Staff added that we were making effortsthrough the appropriate channels to prevent the withdrawal from burma of the United States Volunteer Air Squadron.The Prime Minister said that, if the Chiefs of Staff did not obtain a satisfactory answer within two days, they should report tohim, and he would use his influence to prevent their withdrawal.The United States losses amounted to 35 per cent, of their original strength.The news from Russia continued to be satisfactory, and con-siderable progress had been made south of Leningrad and west of moscow. The Russians had also succeeded in making an advancesouth of Kharkov. In the Crimea German counter-attacks had beenreported.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
Turkey.Supply ofTechnicians.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 79thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (42)28) relating tothe supply of technicians to Turkey, and agreed that the Ministerof Supply should be authorised to inform the heads of undertakings in which suitable volunteers could be found that the War Cabinetregarded the finding of the men as of the very first importance.The Far East. 3.   A discussion took place, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;sAustralia: Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.StrategicalRequirements.The Far East.allied co-ordination.ProposedFar EasternCouncil.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 10thConclusions,Minute 2.)(W.M. (42) 10thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. In connection with the discussion on the previous item,reference was made to the proposal to establish a Far EasternCouncil in London. The Australian Government had now stated(telegram No. 74 of the 25th January) that they would be glad ifthe Prime Minister would communicate to the President their desire for representation on a Pacific War Council to be set up in washington.A telegram had also been received from the New zealand government (No. 45 of the 26th January) proposing the establish-ment of a Far Eastern Council in Washington, on which all theA.B.D.A. Powers would be represented on the Governmental plane.A telegram had accordingly been prepared for despatch to washington communicating these views to the President.The Prime Minister said that, in the course of his speech onthe following day, he proposed to indicate that, under the organisa-tion which had at first been proposed, it had been intended to setup a Far Eastern Council in London, but that the Australian andNew Zealand Governments preferred representation on a Councilin Washington.In discussion, the view was expressed that there was stillconsiderable misunderstanding both in Australia and New Zealandas to the practical working of the proposed Far Eastern Councilin London. Those Governments might well be assuming that themain strategic planning of the war would now be conducted in washington. It did not follow that this would happen, moreespecially since those working in London had behind them the wholemachinery of the Chiefs of Staff organisation an organisation towhich there was no parallel in the United States.Further, the view was very generally expressed that the needsof the Dominions would be better served by a Far Eastern Councilin London than by the establishment of such a Council in washington.Sir Earle Page said that this was certainly his own view, andhe was not without hope that the Australian Government would come round to it, provided that some time could be given for furtherconsideration and that a fuller explanation could be sent to them not only as to the practical advantages of the proposed Far EasternCouncil in London, but also of the arrangements which he under-stood were under consideration for improving the means of consultation in London with the Dominion Governments.The Prime Minister said that he wished to avoid forcing uponthe Dominion Governments a view which they were unwilling toadopt on a matter on which they felt strongly, more especially seeing
that we might have to face a very serious situation in the Pacific.Nevertheless, while he was under an obligation to transmit the viewsof the Australian and New Zealand Governments to Washingtonwithout delay, he would consider whether he could avoid making any&apos;;very specific reference to the matter in his speech on the following day, thus affording time for further explanations to be given.The War Cabinet took note of this discussion.The Dominions. 5. The Prime Minister said that, in his speech in the HouseEepresentation on the following day, he proposed to say that the Australian Govern-in London. ment had stated that they desired that an accredited representativeof the Commonwealth Government should have the right to be heard in the War Cabinet in the formulation and the direction ofpolicy; and that they had been informed that we agreed to this request. New Zealand had asked for, and would be granted, thesame privilege. Representatives of Canada and the Union of SouthAfrica would also be welcomed here on the same terms.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that afurther telegram (No. 81) had been received from the australian government asking that the Australian representative should have full membership of the United Kingdom War Cabinet unless anduntil an Imperial War Cabinet was constituted.It was pointed out that this request seemed to be based on a misunderstanding of the position, since it would clearly be inappropriate that a representative of one of the Dominions shouldclaim the right to attend discussions in the War Cabinet on mattersof purely domestic interest.&apos; The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The Allies.Co-ordination ofWar Effort.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 9thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Prime Minister said that a reply to the telegram whichhe had sent to the President was on the way.In his speech on the following day he proposed to make ageneral statement to the effect that we had established a vast commonpool of weapons, munitions, raw materials and supply, an outline of which was set out in three documents which would shortly bepublished.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.NorthernIreland.(previous reference:W..M. (42) 10thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The War Cabinet were informed that a statement wasbeing published that evening in the Press by the United states authorities announcing the arrival of United States troops inNorthern Ireland.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Far East.AustralianGovernmenfsMessage toSir RobertBrooke-Popham.8.   The War Cabinet had before them-(1) A telegram, dated the 22nd November, from the australian government to the Dominions Office, which included thatGovernmenfs message to Sir Robert Brooke-Popham onhis vacating the post of Commander-in-Chief in the far east (W.P.(42)37).)
(2) An exchange of telegrams in which the Australian Govern-ment withheld their agreement to publication of this message, on the ground that it was purely personal andvaledictory in character (W.P. (42) 35).The Prime Minister said that he regretted that the australian government did not feel able to agree to this message being published, in justice to Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, in view of theviolent and unjustified attacks being made upon him. In thecircumstances, he would not, of course, use the message himself.Sir Earle Page said that, in present circumstances, he hopedthat the message would not be published, since to do so mightembitter controversy.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Great George Street, S.W. 1,January 26, 1942.

George Street, S.V7.1.- MOST SECRET - NO CTRCUIiATTOW.W M . (42 )  II th 0ON0LUS TONS . -26th January - 1948.TTRPITZ.        In answer to a question by the Prime Minister,THE FIRST SEA LORD and THE CHIEF OP THE AIR STAFF saidthat the possibility of attacking the TIRPITZ, now inTrondjhera Fiord, had been exhaustively examined, andit was hoped that an attack would be made as soon asweather conditions were favourable.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was of the utmost importance strategically that the TIRPITZ should, ifpossible, be disabled or sunk.
