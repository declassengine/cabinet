Reference:W.M. (42) 29thConclusions,Minute 4.)The War Cabinet gave further consideration to the Indian)sition in the light of the following : (a) Telegram No. 539 S.^ dated the 6th March, from theViceroy, reporting the views of the Commander-in-Chief. . t(&amp;) Telegrams Nos. 540 S., 545 S. and 549 S. from the Viceroy.(c) A speech by Jawaharlal Nehru, reported in that morning Vnewspapers, to the effect that any promise of reforms atthe end of the war was mere quibbling, and that in theimmediate present a Provisional National Governmentshould be formed, responsible to the Indian people, andnot to the Viceroy or to the British Government.After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows :  (1) The India Committee was&apos; invited to prepare a furtherrevise of the draft Declaration.This revision should be carried out on the basis that the Declaration represented His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s considered scheme for settling India&apos;s constitu-tional position, and irrespective of (a) whether the Declaration was to be issued at once or its issue deferred until after an improvement inthe military situation;(b) whether  soundings  should  be  taken  of   indian political leaders before the Declaration was issued.(2) The draft Declaration, so revised, should be submitted forconsideration by the Special Meeting of the WarCabinet to be held at 12 noon on Monday, the 9th March.(3) A further Meeting of all Ministers of Cabinet rank wouldbe held on Tuesday, the 10th March, at 12 noon.Great George Street, S.W. 1,March 7, 1942.

Your telegram no.270? Following is brief summary of Commander In Chief&apos;s views: present percentage of composition of Indian Armies- Hindu 41, Moslem?, Sikh 10,?  Gorkha 8?, others 5?. The Punjab supplies 60? of whole.

2. (a). Taken by itself knowledge future right to secede would probably have no immediate effect if properly put cut: but? , declaration of local option would have immediate effect of great unsettlement which will probably become dangerous as communal struggle over these proposals develops. Local option will be interpreted as acceptance of Pakistan and effect will be particularly had on Punjab. Moslems of all ranks from provinces not likely to accede will ask how nor-accession provinces will be governed; will they have army of their own,  and if not how will they defend themselves against rest of India or against own minorities ??? In result the minds of all will definitely be taken ? task of fighting our enemies as a sequel resruitment wi1l be gravely imperilled.

(b) General tendency would be to discourage martial races, but bring forward large numbers from non-martial classes who would be worthless against external enemies and only desire to be armed against internal enemies.

(c) any case if as seems probable, widespread communal disturbances develop in india, task of suppressing them indian troops will be impossible- A possibility of communal warfare in Indian Amy cannot be excluded.

(c)? Probable effect on States forces not clear.

(d) Serving Gurkhas unlikely to be ?

(e)  Effect on British officer is likely to be dispiriting while his difficulties are increased. Number of volunteers for indian Army from England is likely to diminish?

? up commander in Chief considers that generally effect of contempleted announcement on fighting services would be disastrous. He is quite certain contemplated announcement will take soldier&apos;s mind sooner or later off fighting our enemies and start him looking ever his shoulder. Finally present time when things are going wrong,  would be particularly unhappy for such announcement-


Prom     ...     viceroy to Secretary ox Stats for IndiaDespatched     10.01 hours, 6th March, 1942,MOST IMMEDIATE540-SMy telegram 518-S of March 3rd.   You will, receive by direct repetition views of Cunningham, Glancy and Hallett on points referred to in my telegram 518,2.        In order to allow them to see these specific points in perspective-I had to give them the whole picture, namely the full text of draft declaration as it then stood, withvariations given in your telegram 3852 dated March 1st.   Inso doing I permitted them to offer personally to me any comments they wished to make on scheme as a whole;   Hallettand Glancy have offered general comments but these will nothave been repeated to you.3,        Hallett is not unduly alarmed though he isapprehensive of intensifying Congress agrarian agitation inconsequence.   However, in view of Commander-in-Chief&apos;sreactions (separately telegraphed), I should be doingwrong in keeping from you Glancy&apos;s, which are briefly -(a) contemplated declaration will dumbfound Indian elementswho have hitherto helped, in war and. they will cease to co-operate; (b) nothing will convince Moslems that framing a constitution as contemplated in proposed declaration willnot amount to betrayal; (c) effect on Services will be serious; (d) Sikenclar will probably resign.4.     I cannot disregard Governor of the Punjab and onmandex-.in-Chlet4b- vLews and something must be done tomeet them,
5.        I am not suggesting that His Majesty&apos;s Government can at this stage abandon the essentials of their elan, and I need hardly say it is tar from my desire to mobilise opinionagainst it.   But I -do earnestly request you to see. at least^that pledge to minorities is reiterated as an integral partof our new declaration, as suggested in paragraph 2 of my telegram 504-3 of March 2nd,  ,6.        A promise of local option by itself is no comfort tominority of Moslems in United Provinces and Bihar, and mustrouse gravest apprehensions and bitterest feelings amongstSikhs in the Punjab unless accompanied by specific renewal of our pledge.7.        I do not pretend that the mere incorporation of thispledge would solve the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s difficulties.Nothing short of the removal of local option (which involves(omission)ing ourselves as guarantors of all the minoritiesin the unification of British India) would do that.    If localoption remains the incorporation of minority pledge may (inhis view) at the best   prove   temporary palliative to such an extent as it might reassure civil opinion amongst -the   4minorities affected.   But within the framework of H.M.G.*splan this&apos;is the best that I can suggest,8.        The method of insertion that I have proposed is neitherobstructive nor offensive, and is consistent with the basicpolicy of throwing on Indians the responsibility of solvingI their own problem.    It is the only hope I can see ofmitigating the effect of communal apprehensions withoutdestroying the basis of the present declaration.9.        In view of the Governors&apos; reactions, I an very glad tosee that the word &quot;independence&quot; is not in the latest draft,though I myself had suggested it.   Clearly it-ought to be avoided.&apos;
