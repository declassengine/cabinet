The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 891-897 :--In the home theatre the enemy had lost 19 aircraft, 8 probableand 22 damaged; we had lost 51.In the Middle East the enemy had lost 43 destroyed, 12 probably destroyed and 28 damaged; we had lost 23 with 16 damaged.Malta had been heavily attacked from the air. The few fightersthat had been left at Singapore had been withdrawn, first toPalembang in Sumatra, and later to Java.A Liberator machine with four officers returning to this country from the Middle East had been shot down in error. A Court of inquiry was being held.During the previous week 63,000 tons of shipping had been lost,including marine casualties. This figure did not include the possibleloss of the Normandie or ships which must have been sunk whilstendeavouring to get out of Singapore.Albacores had made a successful attack that morning on enemywarships in the Mediterranean and claimed to have hit two Italian!cruisers.The latest attempt to run a convoy into Malta had been unsuccessful. The position was under examination by the Chiefsof Staff.In Burma, on the Southern Front, our forward troops were about 10 miles North-West of Martaban. The Japanese had attacked from Paan and also from Thaton.Palembang Town and aerodrome had been captured by theJapanese on the 15th February. The Japanese were nowthreatening the islands on the east side of Java.The Axis Forces in Libya were in two main groups, one in theMartuba-Tmimi area and the other about Mekili.There had been no forward movement on the Russian frontduring the previous week and German counter-attacks had been successfully resisted by the Russians. Deep snow and thaw hadaffected the operations.The Prime Minister said that, in reply to a congratulatorytelegram from himself on the success of the Red Armies, M. stalin had said that, in spite of present difficulties, he was confident thatthe common enemy would be broken.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Far East(previous reference:W.M.

A general discussion took place on the military situation asa whole, with particular reference to the fall of Singapore and tothe probability of further Japanese successes.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chiefs of Staff to prepare an appreciation ofthe military situation in the light of recent events.aircraft production.Production inIndia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 241stConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Minister of Labour and National Service suggestedthat the possibility of building fighter aircraft in India should bere-examined. This would probably involve the transfer of plant;but, when the factory was in production, considerable economies in shipping would result.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Aircraft Production to furnish areport on this matter.[23479]b 2
Franoe.Relations withthe vichy government.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 20thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (42) 86) containing a draftnotification to the Vichy Government in regard to the use of french ships for supplying Axis forces in Libya.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft notification, subject to (a) the omission of the first paragraph and the word&quot; now &quot; in the second paragraph;(6) the agreement of the United States Government being obtained before the notification was despatched.The Blockade. 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theGreece. Minister of Economic Warfare (W.P. (42) 80)  proposing  that(Previous further shipments of wheat to Greece should be made in neutralReference: ships, not under Allied charter it was hoped to obtain SwedishW.M. (42) 4th ships now in the Baltic -and subject to specified conditions set outConclusions,      in the Annex to his Paper.Minute 5.) jn discussion, the First Lord of the Admiralty asked that itshould be recorded that, in his view, it was not practicable to arrangesafe-conduct for individual ships, taking into account the conditions under which our submarines operate in the Mediterranean, and thatthe matter would be better dealt with by unescorted convoys ofpreferably six, or at least not less than three, ships at a time.After discussion, the War Cabinet Gave general approval in principle to the proposals in theMinister of Economic Warfare&apos;s Memorandum, subject to agreement being reached between the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Minister as to the exactconditions which should be imposed. (In the foreign secretary&apos;s view, unless some of the conditions were lessstrictly drafted, the scheme was unlikely to be accepted.)Turkey. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the steel Supplies.   Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 73) as to whethercertain improvements to the steel works at Karabuk should be met from this country.The War Cabinet was informed that, since this paper had been circulated, the Chairman of the Allied Supplies Executive had with-drawn his objections to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals.The War Cabinet accordingly approved the proposalsummarised in paragraph 5 of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper.Air Transport. 7.   The Prime Minister referred to three Memoranda whichAllocation of had Deen circulated to the War Cabinet&apos;on the allocation of airAir Passages.     passages and transport facilities (W.P. (42) 50, 77 and 79).At the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion, the War Cabinet Invited the Lord President of the Council to examine thismatter in consultation with the Ministers concerned, andto determine whether alterations were called for in thepresent system of allocating air transport facilities.
Japan. 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theProposed Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 81) as to the replyReciprocal to be sent to a proposal, made by the Japanese to the United StatesExchange of and ourselves, for an &quot;exchange at Lourencp Marques, of certain british and categories of persons. The question at issue was whether we shouldJapanese agree to an exchange on the basis of the categories of persons set outOfficials. in paragraph 4 of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum (namely,British Officials and other Nationals in Indo-China, Siam and the philippines, as well as Japan), or whether, as proposed by theColonial Office, we should ask for the inclusion of officials and othernationals in the British territories lately captured by the Japanese.In the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view, a proposal to include officials in British territories overrun by Japan would weight the scheme asa whole so greatly in our favour that there would be no chance ofits acceptance.After a short discussion, the War cabinet authorised the Foreign Secretary to reply to the Japaneseproposals on the lines set out in paragraph 4 of his memorandum (subject to there being no incompatibilitywith the United States arrangements); and to arrange forthe problem of colonial officials and communities to betaken up through the International Red Cross and theArgentine Government, on the lines proposed in para-graph 10 of his Memorandum.Hong Kong. 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a series of telegramsTreatment of (W.P. (42) 82) and a letter from the Office of the High CommissionerPrisoners. for Canada (W.P. (42) 83) on the question of publicity about theQuestion of treatment of prisoners at Hong Kong.Publicity: The War Cabinet decided as follows :-(1) It was undesirable to give immediate publicity to thismatter. The question should be brought up in a week&apos;s time.(2) The Minister of Information was invited to explain to thePress that publicity at the present moment on thisquestion would have a bad effect on morale in the far east, and would cause great distress to the relations Ofthose concerned; that no official statement ;as to theposition had yet been obtained; and that on balance,therefore, it was undesirable that prominence should begiven to this matter for the present.(3) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was invited toinform the Dominion Governments of the decision reached.Gas Masks. 10.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the carrying by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (42) 76), to public. which was attached a Report by the Home Defence Committee. TheMemorandum proposed that, subject to suitable safeguards, thepublic should be advised that in present circumstances they neednot carry their gas-masks at all times, but should leave them at their place of residence, where they could be reached easily in case of need.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security emphasised-sised that the instructions to the civil population should be in line with the orders issued to the Armed Forces in regard to the carryingof respirators. Further, if gas-masks were carried by the general public, the resulting wear and tear involved more frequentreplacement.
After a short discussion, the War Cabinet--(1) Decided that the present moment was inappropriate lora relaxation of the existing injunctions as to the carryingof gas-masks by the Civil population.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to consider whetherthe instructions issued as to the carrying of respiratorsin the Army was consistent with the decision at (1).Palestine.illegal immigration.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 297thConclusions,Minute 4.)11. The War Cabinet referred to their decision of the27th November, 1940, that, with the exception of illegal immigrantssaved from S.S. Patria, who should be allowed to remain in Palestineon the usual conditions, in future all other illegal immigrantsattempting to enter Palestine should be diverted to Mauritius or elsewhere.Owing to the absence of shipping to take them to Mauritius, anumber of illegal immigrants, brought to Palestine in the Darien,had now been detained in an internment camp in Palestine foreleven months.The Prime Minister raised the question whether these interneesshould not now be released. At the time when the War cabinet considered this matter in November 1940 it had looked as though we might be subjected to a wave of illegal immigration. But now that the whole of South-Eastern Europe was in German hands this risk must be greatly diminished.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that this risk couldnot be ignored. He referred to a ship of 200 tons with 600 or 700would-be immigrants which had sailed from Constansa and had recently arrived at Istanbul on the way to Palestine. On security grounds alone, any relaxation of the War Cabinet decision on thismatter was open to strong objection. Further, any weakening of our attitude in this matter would afford encouragement to the very-undesirable trade in illegal immigration into Palestine.The War Cabinet-Deferred a decision on this matter until the Secretary ofState for the Colonies had ascertained the views of theMinister of State.Parliament.Statement bythe PrimeMinister on tuesday, the17th February.Scharnhorst,Gneisenau andPrinz Eugen.12. The Prime Minister said it was unfortunate that we hadnot succeeded in sinking either the Scharnhorst, the Gneisenau orthe Prinz Eugen, although it was believed that they had sufferedconsiderable damage. But the picture of the incident, as presented by the British Press, showed complete ignorance of the position. if at any time during the last ten and a half months these vessels could have been repaired, they would have been able to break out directlyon to the Atlantic trade routes. But, owing to efforts of the R. A.F.,it had not been possible to render these ships ready for sea at Brest.On balance, the position was eased by their removal from Brest to german ports.Discussion followed on the question of procedure, namely,whether the statement which the Prime Minister intended to make on this matter on the following day should or should not be madeon a Motion for the Adjournment. vThe War Cabinet was informed that in certain quarters it was believed that the Prime Minister would make a statement on thefollowing day, to be followed by a Debate about the fall of singapore.The Prime Minister said that, as it was only a fortnight sincethe last Debate on the general war situation, which had covered the
situation in the Far East, and as a full report as to the events at singapore had not yet been received, a Debate on the matter on thefollowing day would not serve any useful purpose. He proposed tomake clear to the House the reasons why, in his view, it was undesirable to have a Debate on either of these matters on thefollowing day.The War Cabinet-Agreed that it was undesirable that there should be a debate on either of these questions on the following day.At the same time, it would be better that a Motion forthe Adjournment should be moved by the Prime minister or the Chief Whip, rather than that matters should be leftso that the Adjournment of the House might be moved bysome other Member.Great George Street, S. W. 1,February 16, 1942.

- MOST1 SECRET - NO CIRCULATION.W.M. (42) 21, MINUTE 2.February,THE FAR EAST. Points made in discussion on this item.No report had yet been received giving detailsas to the happenings at Singapore immediately prior tothe fall of the fortress .   We did not know whether anytroops had got away, but this seemed to be unlikely.It was clear now that Japan was a most formidableand dangerous antagonist.   The Japanese were formidablealike as fighters and s.s tacticians .   Our militaryperformance in Malaya had left much to be desired.Reference was made to   a report submitted byGeneral. Percival appraising Japanese strategy and fighting qualities.   This report also pointed out thatthe Japanese relied on mechanical transport much lessthan we did.In retrospect, it now seemed, a pity that we had.sent the 18th Division to Singapore.   When we had done so, we had thought that by doing so we should enablethe defence of the fortress to be continued for   atleast a month.Reference was made to   the fact that the AustralianPrime Minister had represented that failure to attemptto defend Singapore to the utmost would be an inexcusablebetrayal.   But it was now clear that these troops wouldhave been better employed elsewhere.The same question had now to be faced as regardsSumatra and Java.   The maintenance of our line of communications with China by the Burma Road, was of theutmost importance.   We should have to consider whether we ought not to divert to Burma and to Australiareinforcements now on their way to the Far Easterntheatre, which might otherwise be employed to stiffenresistance in Sumatra and Java-   This issue would, haveto be considered by the Pacific War Council s.t their meeting in London on the following day.
