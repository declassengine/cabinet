1.   The War Cabinet had before them -(a) A further revise of the draft declaration prepared by theCommittee on India (W.P. (42) 115).(6) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India,covering a draft telegram to the Viceroy (W.P. (42) 116).The. War Cabinet first considered the revise of the draft declaration, which was approved.The timing of. its issue was next considered. The PrimeMinister said that events had shown that the immediate issue ofthe Declaration, without any preliminary sounding of publicopinion in India, would be most unwise. This course would probablylead to the rejection of the Declaration by Congress, and wouldgive rise to divisions of opinion here. In the circumstances, hethought that the right course was to accept the very generous offer made by the Lord Privy Seal to visit India and discuss matters withthe leaders of the main Indian political parties. The whole WarCabinet were greatly indebted to the Lord Privy Seal for this offer,and he would go with the fullest confidence of all of them. TheLord Privy Seal would take with him the draft Declaration as theplan which he would discuss with the leaders of Indian opinion,with a view to seeing whether it met with the measure of acceptancevital to its success.The next question concerned the date of the announcement ofthe Lord Privy Seal&apos;s mission.   In discussion, Wednesday, the: 11th March, was regarded as the most appropriate day.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a first draft ofthe statement which he proposed should be made.This met with general approval.Importance was attached to this statement making it-clear thatthe Lord Privy Seal was taking out to India a specific scheme approved by the War Cabinet. Otherwise it would be said that hewas going out to negotiate.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the revised draft Declaration (W.P. (42) 115),and agreed that it should be circulated forthwith to all ministers of Cabinet rank, who had been invited toattend a further Meeting at 12 noon on the following day.(2) Approved the proposal that the Lord Privy Seal should visit India, with authority to discuss the schemeembodied in the Declaration with the leaders of indian opinion, in order to see whether it met with the measureof acceptance vital to its success.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for India to send a telegram to the Viceroy informing him of this decision.(4) Agreed that an announcement of the decision in (2) shouldbe made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons* on Wednesday, the 11th March, a correspondingannouncement being made in the House of Lords.(5) Invited the Committee on India to consider the draft telegram to the Viceroy, prepared by the Secretary ofState for India (W.P. (42) 116), which would requirerecasting in the light of the decision in (2).India.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 30thConclusions.)
Major-general sir A.Cunningham.Question offurtherEmployment.. 3. The War Cabinet considered whether Sir A. Cunninghamshould be offered employment as Chairman of a Committee to review the transport establishments of field force units.The War Cabinet were reminded that Sir A. Cunningham hadbeen relieved of his Command of the 8th Army on the25th November, when General Auchinleck had lost confidence inhis determination to press the offensive.The War Cabinet were informed that there was no questionof giving Sir A. Cunningham any further operational or field forcecommand. The question at issue was whether he should be con-sidered for further employment in an administrative role.The War Cabinet decided &apos;(1) That Sir A. Cunningham should -not be appointed chairman of the Committee in question.(2) That the reply to any Parliamentary Question should beto the effect that at present no suitable employment was available for him.Great George Street, S.W.1,March 9, 1942.Production. 2.   The Prime Minister said that he thought the War cabinet minister in charge of Production matters should bear the title&quot; Minister of Production.&quot;It was for consideration whether a revised White Paper,defining the Minister&apos;s duties, should be issued, or whether he (thePrime Minister) should make a statement in the House on thematter. He favoured the latter course, and hoped that a statement could be made not later than Thursday. He had asked the lord president of the Council to co-operate with the Minister of state in preparing this statement. He thought that the House was likelyto demand a debate on Production in the following week.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
