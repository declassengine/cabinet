The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a number of telegrams about the appointment of Mr. Casey as Minister of State.Further public discussion of the matter would not be in the publicinterest and should be avoided.3. The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to convene a meeting to enquire into and reporton the state of our civilian gas preparations.Production.Joint War Pro-duction Staff.4. The War Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (42) 132) proposing the setting up ofa Joint War Production Staff. The terms of reference and the composition of the Joint Staff were set out in paragraph 3 of theMemorandum.[23609]b 2
Points made in discussion : -(1) It was suggested that the Joint War Production staff should include a representative to advise on researchproblems.It was stated that the Minister could obtain theinformation he required from the Defence Panel of the scientific Advisory Committee, which had ready meansof access to the Heads of the Research Departments ofeach of the three Services.(2) Sir Earle Page asked that, in his forthcoming speech, theMinister of Production would emphasise that steps would be taken to establish machinery in London toensure the best possible use of productive capacitythroughout the Empire.(3) The Minister of Production said that the Controller ofMerchant Shipbuilding would attend Meetings of theJoint War Production Staff when required.(4) The Minister of Aircraft Production said that it had beenagreed that the Supply Ministers should be entitled toattend Meetings of the Joint War Production Staff when matters of sufficient importance were being discussed.The War Cabinet-Approved the setting up of a Joint War Production Staff,with the composition and Terms of Reference set out inparagraph 3 of W.P. (42) 132, subject to points (3) and(4) above.Indian Army.Provision ofBritish Officers.5. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theSecretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (42) 125 and 130) about the supply of British Officers for theIndian Army, and their pay.The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council to examine thequestions dealt with in these papers, and to make recom-mendations to the War Cabinet.Man-Power.Suggestedcancellation ofan enlistmentnotice.6. The Minister of Labour and National Service gave the WarCabinet particulars of a case in which he had been asked to cancelan enlistment notice which had been issued. The man in question was a journalist. To agree to the action proposed would be entirelycontrary to the normal procedure, and was much to be deprecated.The War Cabinet :-Agreed that the normal procedure should take its course.Parliament.ProductionDebate.7. The War Cabinet discussed the arrangements for theforthcoming Debate on Production.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Minister of Production should open the debate, and that the Acting Leader of the House should consult with the Minister of Production and the Ministerof Supply as to which of them should wind up the Debate,according as to whether the Debate was more concernedwith the organisation of production generally, or withdepartmental matters.
173HJT.M. 36 (42).The Press.(previous reference:W.M. (42)conclusions minute 1.)8. The War Cabinet considered the course to be followed ifthere was a demand for a Debate arising out of the statement madeby the Home Secretary on Thursday, 19th March.35th        A motion hadjbeen put down for discussion of this matter inthe House of Lords, but it was hoped that it would be withdrawn.I The general view of the War Cabinet was that the demand fora debate seemed to be dying down. It was in any case undesirable that this matter should be debated on the Adjournment, and, so faras possible, steps should be taken to secure that this did not happen.If, contrary to expectation, there was substantial demand for a debate, the Government should agree, but on condition that a Motionwas tabled, and the matter carried to a Division. In this event the debate should be on Thursday, 26th March, and the House should adjourn on Friday, 27th March.Home Defence..Role of the CivilPopulation.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 43rdConclusions,Minute 7.)9. The Lord President of the Council informed the War-Cabinet that some of his colleagues had been giving. furtherconsideration to this question, which was to be the subject of debate in the House of Lords on the following day, and of a parliamentary question in the House of Commons.The previous instructions on the matter had been revised, thebalance of the statement being so altered as to give more encourage-ment to those members of the public who helped in resisting theinvader.The War Cabinet took note that, subject to the approvalof the text by the Prime Minister, statements on these lines would be made in both Houses of Parliament on thefollowing day.Great George Street, S.WMarch 23, 1942.1,

CHEMICAL WARFARE AND CIVILIAN ANTI-GASPREPARATIONS.W.M. (43) 56, Minute 5.THE PRIME MINISTER   informed the War Cabinet thatin   a telegram which he had sent to M. Stalin (No .T .431/2)he had referred to the possible use of gas by the Germanson the Russian Front.   He had assured M. Stalin   thatwe would treat any use of poison gas by the enemy against russia exactly as if it was directed against ourselves.He had added that at a suitable moment we should have toconsider whether we should give a public warning to this effect, as this might deter the enemy.   He had askedM. Stalin&apos;s views on this point, and whether there was sufficient evidence of German preparations to justify a warning.   Before issuing such a warning we should, ofcourse, want ample time to bring all our anti-gaspreparations to extreme readiness.In discussion, THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERALSTAFF said that the Chiefs of Staff were considering whether the reserves of gas which we were accumulatingwere adequate.   We wanted to be in a position that ifwe started to use this weapon we could continue at fullintensity.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS was invited to convene a Meeting to inquire into anrireport on the state of our civilian^gai-^preparations .This report should cover the following points(l) The existing state of preparedness of ouranti-gas preparations:(2) What is necessary to bring these prepara-tions up to date:(3) How long will it take to do so.It should be an instruction that no refer-ence to this inquiry is to be allowed to appear in the Press.The inquiry might also deal with thequestion whether the existing instru*s-tions as tomodified.
