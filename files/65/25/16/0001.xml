If they took this view, itcould be pointed out that the present proposal went no further than the arrangements made for the Imperial War Cabinets of1917 and 1918.The War Cabinet-Decided that the proposal outlined by the Secretary ofState&apos;s Paper should be agreed to, and that the Govern-&apos;.&quot;.\&apos; ment of India should be invited to send a representative to attend the War Cabinet, on the same general terms asin the invitation issued to Australia and other Dominions.India.The; Governor-General&apos;sExecutiveCouncil.(previous reference: .W.M.

(42) 43).(b) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India,setting out his views on the Indian political situation(W.P. (42) 42).The upshot of this Memorandum was that theSecretary of State agreed with the Viceroy&apos;s conclusion(set out in his telegram) that there was no furtherinterim constitutional advance which we could make;that we had in the present Central Executive and national Defence Council as representative and asefficient an instrument for associating India with thewar effort as we were likely to get at this juncturewithout aggravating her internal discords: and thatwe should do all we could to make the most of thisinstrument, not Only in matters of Imperial and international status, but in the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment towards it. ;!(c) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India; (W.P.

India &apos;sWar Effort.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 131stConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 54), setting out themeasures taken to expand India&apos;s war effort, and the steps stillrequired to ensure that those measures achieved success.X&quot;The particular points in which help was required in regardto personnel were : (a) Officers and other British Military personnel for theMilitary forces, and(6) Managers and Foremen for the Ordnance factories.The Secretary of State for India asked that, with theapproval of the War Cabinet, he should have the full support and assistance of both his colleagues concerned in these two matters.He laid particular emphasis on the importance of getting officersof good quality. He hoped that the Army Authorities in theMiddle East, would find it possible to allow a certain number ofmen, who. were fit for Commissions, but for whom commissions werenot available in, the Army in the Middle East, to be posted to Indiato be granted commissions. .  &apos;      ,(d) A Memorandum by the Lord; Privy&apos;Seal, (W.P. (42) 59). i   urging that a renewed effort should be made to get theleaders of the Indian political parties to unite; that,,: \ .  delay would only make the problem harder; and that a: &apos;  representative, with powers to negotiate within wide,:   limits,  should be&apos; sent  to  India  now,  a  CabinetCommittee being appointed to draw up  terms of&apos;    reference and powers. r &apos;The&apos; following were the  main points in  a  preliminary discussion: (1) It was argued that it was dangerous to stand on thepresent position without making every effort to see whether some way out of the present Constitutionaldeadlock could not be found. We ought not to be content to take the view that we could make no further advance and that the next move was with Congress.(2) The whole position in Asia might change very rapidly.We should not exclude the possibility of a Pan-Asiaticmovement. But our rule in India had influencedIndian opinions and ideals, and if we took the rightline we should be able to maintain the ties between india and this country.(3) On the other hand, it was difficult to see what further stepwe could take by the way of any interim constitutional advance which would not prejudice the ultimateposition. It was clearly impossible to attempt any final settlement of the Constitutional position at the pi&apos;esentmoment.After further general discussion, the War Cabinet agreed asfollows : (a) The proposed answer to Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru shouldbe deferred.(6) The Secretary of State for India was invited to prepare an alternative draft statement on the basis of thediscussion.

(42) 48) dealing withcertain points arising out of his conversations with M. Stalin in moscow.The main issue discussed was whether we should transmit tothe United States Government, without comments, the points raised by M. Stalin, or whether we should at the same time give an indication of the views we took in regard to these points.After a preliminary discussion, the War Cabinet .Agreed that this matter should be considered at a special meeting of the War Cabinet to be held early in thefollowing week.Great George Street, S. W. 1,February 5, 1942.At the suggestion of the Prime Minister, the War Cabinet Gave general approval to the proposal summarised at&quot; X &quot;; and asked that the Ministers concerned should do all that they could to assist the Secretary of State for indian these matters.
