(42) 102) setting out the steps(Previous ., which could be taken to mitigate the effects on food production in reference: this country of the loss of wheat offals by the raising of the rateW.M.

If 87,000 tons of maize could be made available to agriculture during this period, the milling ratio could be increasedwithout any adverse...effectu,.oa,.homfi..-.production during the sameperiod.The short point at issue was whether the prospects of importingthis 87,000 tons of maize were sufficiently good to justify us in notgiving to the producers concerned any warning that there might bea shortage of feeding-stuffs.The view taken was that, since at the present moment we shouldassign a very high priority to the importation of this quality of maize, we were justified in not giving any such warning.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries suggested that the raising of the milling ratio to 85 per cent, should not be regardedas a permanent measure. If the shipping situation improved, he hoped that we might return to the 75 per cent, ratio.The view expressed was that the shipping situation was unlikely to improve to the extent that would permit of this measure; but it would always be open to the Minister to raise thepoint if, in his view, the situation warranted this course.The War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were accordingly as follows : (1) The Minister of Food was authorised to take the necessary action to raise the milling ratio to 85 per cent, on ort.   .  about the 1st April.(2) The Agricultural Departments should proceed on theassumption that the consequent loss of wheat offalswould be met, during the period up to the end ofSeptember, by adding 87,000 tons of maize to the cerealfeeding-stuffs available for distribution under the rationing scheme.(3) This maize could be drawn in the early summer months from the maize reserve held by the Ministry of Food,on the understanding that very high priority would be assigned to the importation of maize towards the endNof the summer, with a view to restoring the reserve toits present level by the end of September.2. In connection with the preceding Minute, the PrimeMinister reported to the War Cabinet that he had sent a telegram to President Roosevelt dealing with ;(a) Shipping required for troop movements, and(b) The extent to which the shipping capacity available to us for the United Kingdom Import Programme would beincreased in the latter half of 1942 out of the UnitedStates Programme of Merchant Shipbuilding.The Prime Minister also mentioned that a large number ofships which had left Singapore were now considerably overdue.  Itwas to be feared that we had suffered considerable shipping losses in that area. .The War Cabinet Invited the Minister of War Transport-1(a) To submit to the Prime Minister proposals wherebycertain ships of suitable speed at present used for importing purposes would be converted to carrytroops; the loss to our importing capacity beingmade good by further American tonnage being placed at our disposal.

The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs, covering a revised draft of theDeclaration to be made by His Majesty&apos;,s Government (W.P. (42)The War Cabinet were informed-that the Cabinet Committeeon India had considered whether any amendment should be madeto the draft Declaration to make clear that the Declaration repre-sented finality and that we were not prepared to bargain in regardto it.  The view taken had been that this point should be dealt within an introductory paragraph prefixed to the draft Declaration.This would be better than to insert words in the opening paragraphof the Declaration, since this paragraph did not cover the questionof responsibility for carrying on the Government during the war.The War Cabinefs,conclusions were as follows : (1) Approval was given to the terms of the revised draft declaration as amended, and it was agreed that it shouldbe circulated to all Ministers of Cabinet rank, who shouldbe invited to attend a Meeting on this matter at *12 noon on the following day.(2) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was invitedto communicate copies of the draft Declaration to theDominion Prime Ministers, for their personal informa-tion.(3) Great importance, was attached to.a period of, say, two orthree days elapsing after the Declaration had been published, during which time the Declaration should beleft to make its effect on public opinion, both here andin India., During this period, public statementsexplanatory of the Declaration should be avoided. TheHouse of Commons should be informed that it was undesirable that the matter should be debated until theIndian reaction to the Declaration was known.4. The Prime Minister said that the normal times for meetings of the War Cabinet for the present would be as follows : Monday, 5 - 30 p.m.Wednesday, 12 noon.Thursday, 12 noon.The Meetings on Monday would be attended by War cabinet ministers and other Ministers who normally attend this Meeting,together with the Chiefs of Staff. The Meetings on Wednesday and.Thursday would be attended by War Cabinet Ministers only, exceptin so far as other Ministers might be invited to attend for particular items. -A Meeting of the Pacific War Council would normally takeplace on Tuesday at 6 p.m., and there would normally be a Meetingof the Defence Committee on Wednesday night.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.5. The War Cabinet invited the Lord Privy Seal to consult with the Joint Parliamentary Secretary of the Treasury, on aproposal that Parliament should normally sit from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m.as from about the date when double-summer-time is introduced; andto report whether this change would be generally acceptable.*Great Greorge Street, S.
