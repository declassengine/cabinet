1. The Prime Minister said that a telegram had been receivedfrom the Rear-Admiral, Malaya, suggesting that a military governor should now be appointed at Singapore. This suggestion had been made at an earlier date, but at that time the supreme commander had regarded it as unnecessary. The matter was underconsideration by the Ministers concerned.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Fighting and civil defence services.Post-WarCredits.(previous reference:W.M.

He thought that this leakage was so serious that an inquiry should be held into it.On the suggestion of the Prime Minister, the War Cabinet Invited the Lord President of the Council to inquire intothe leakage which had taken place.France.Relations withVichyGovernment.St. Pierre andMiquelon.(previous reference: ,W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 672 of the 5th February from our Ambassador atWashington reporting an interview with the United states secretary of State. Mr. Hull, who had shown himself undulysusceptible to the diplomatic pressure which had been brought tobear on him by the Vichy Government, had taken the view that theterms of the communique about St. Pierre and Miquelon would be unacceptable to the Vichy Government. Further, he feared that itwould destroy the locus standi which the United States Governmenthad hitherto had to press the Vichy Government to maintain thestatus quo against Germany. Mr. Hull had also suggested that circumstances might arise in which it would be necessary for theUnited States Observers to be withdrawn from North Africa.Lord Halifax had urged him strongly not to adopt this course.The Foreign Secretary said that, in his view, it was of theutmost importance that the United States Government should notyield to the Vichy Government. It was the United States whichwas in a position to exercise pressure on the Vichy Government, andnot vice versa, and there were a number of ways in which this couldbe done, e.g,, by means of the Vichy French shipping in the UnitedStates. He proposed, if the War Cabinet agreed, to send a telegram to Lord Halifax instructing him to speak on these lines to theUnited States authorities.The War Cabinet-Invited   the   Foreign   Secretary  to  telegraph  to  our ambassador at Washington on the lines proposed.Consideration 4.   The War Cabinet had before them the following Papers : under Lease- (a) A   draft   telegram   to   Washington,  prepared   by  the Lend. Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the lines suggested in(Previous the last discussion of this matter at the War cabinet reference: (W.P. (42) 63).W.M. (42) 14th ip) A draft telegram to Washington, prepared by the ForeignConclusions, Secretary, to which was appended a draft of an agreedMinute 8.)&apos; interpretation of Article VII (W.P. (42) 62).This draft was based on the suggestions made byLord Halifax in his telegram of the 29th December last(No. 6106), but with certain modifications.[23449] b 2
(c) A further draft telegram prepared by the Foreign Secretaryvin the light of certain further information Obtained from washington, which made him doubtful whether the drafts in (6) would be accepted by the United States(W.P. (42) 66).The Prime &quot;Minister read to the War Cabinet a personal telegram which he. had received from the President on the previous day, expressing strong hope that we could agree promptly to thepresent draft of the interim Lend-Lease Agreement, together withthe terms of a draft of a Personal reply which he had prepared.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was preparedto accept the first draft proposed by the Foreign Secretary(W.P. (42) 62).General agreement was expressed with the terms of this draft.The Foreign Secretary indicated that he rather doubted whether this draft would be accepted, and it was therefore forconsideration whether both his draft telegrams (W.P. (42) 62 and 66)should be sent to Lord Halifax, with instructions that he shoulddeliver the telegram and draft note in the former memorandum, andshould endeavour to obtain acceptance on this basis; and should atthe same time forward to us his comments on the alternativeexchange of Notes proposed in the latter Memorandum.This course was supported on the grounds that it was mostimportant to avoid any impairment of relations with the UnitedStates at this moment. Moreover, it would be unfortunate if troublearose in Congress over this issue.Discussion showed that the general view of the War cabinet was that the right course was to despatch the telegram and notecontained in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s first Memorandum only(W.P. (42) 62). The point of view to which most importance was attached by the War Cabinet was that we should not put ourselves in the position of appearing to give undertakings in regard to our system of Imperial Preference in exchange for benefits received under the Lease-Lend Act. If we were to alter our system ofImperial Preference, this should be done as part of negotiations for economic concessions from other countries. It was pointed out that since 1898 we had always maintained our right, without infringingthe most-favoured-nation clause, to afford preferential treatment toEmpire countries. In the interests of good relations between thiscountry and the United States, it was important that we shouldmake clear to them what strong feelings would be aroused if itappeared that the United States was pressing us to sign an agree-ment which involved interference between Empire countries.The position of the Dominion Governments was referred to.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs explained that theDominion Governments had been kept fully informed of the negotia-tions on this matter, but that their views had not been asked. Wehad reason to believe, however, that the present Governments in theDominions were prepared to accept the revised draft of Article VII.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that preferencein the Colonies was of less importance than in the Dominions.There was, however, the danger that conditions might change in theUnited States, either by the return of a high tariff party or by the adherence of &apos;&apos; like-minded &apos;&apos; countries which might, by their lowercost of production, make effective Colonial competition impossible.Ifysuch a situation should arise and the proposed policy were to be abandoned by the United States, it would be impossible for GreatBritain to re-establish Colonial preferences. Many of the Legisla-tures took little interest in the subject, e.g., the Ceylon Government
U.S.S.R. 5.   The War Cabinet had a further discussion on the Memo-(Previous randum submitted by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsReference: (W.P. (42) 48).W.M. (42) 16th        &quot;j^g discussion and conclusions reached are recorded in theConclusions, Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Minute 5.)Great George Street, S.W. 1,February 6, 1942.were averse from giving any concessions to British exports, beingquite indifferent to the planters&apos; interests in the Empire teapreference.The War Cabinet decided as follows : (1) The Foreign Secretary was invited to despatch to our ambassador at Washington the draft telegrams set outin Paper W.P. (42) 62.(2) These telegrams should be repeated to the DominionGovernments, who should be informed of the actionwhich we were taking.(3) The Prime Minister undertook to revise his draft telegram to President Roosevelt and to despatch it.(4) It was emphasised that the point to which we attached mostimportance was that we should not be asked to give any undertaking in regard to our system of imperial preference in exchange for benefits received under the lease-Lend Act.
