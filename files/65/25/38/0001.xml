The Chiefs of Staff reported the main events of the past week. Bomber Command had carried out five day attacks against targets in Northern France, and had made two heavy attacks onEssen and one on Lubeck, the latter being particularly successful.Forty-five bombers had been lost.During the past seven days Fighter Command had lost22 aircraft (6 pilots safe). Total enemy losses in the home theatreamounted to 37 destroyed, 11 probably, and 32 damaged.The scale of enemy air attacks on Malta was diminishing.In the Far East the Japanese had lost 22 aircraft destroyed,9 probably, 7 damaged, as against 6 machines lost by American and australian Forces.Full details were not yet available regarding the enemy attack against the convoy proceeding to Murmansk. Three ships hadbeen bombed and the enemy had claimed that one had been sunk.One enemy destroyer had been sunk.Aerial photographs showed that the lock gates at St. Nazairehad been completely destroyed.Allied shipping losses during the previous week had totalled112,000 tons.General Alexander had visited Chungking and had met theGeneralissimo, whom he had found most friendly and co-operative.The Generalissimo had placed all Chinese Forces in Burma under General Alexander&apos;s command.Details were given of the course of fighting and of troopdispositions.There was little to report in Russia, where a thaw had set inon the Moscow front.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Japan. 2.   The Permanent  Undersecretary of State for ForeignRepresentation Affairs said that last year we had asked the Argentine Governmentof British to take charge of our interests in Japan.   The United StatesInterests. Government had at first concurred in this course, but later haddemurred on the grounds that it might afford the argentine government further reason for not breaking with the Axis powers at the Rio de Janeiro Conference. Thereupon we had sounded theArgentine Government as to whether they were willing to make achange, but they had been disinclined to this course. We had thengiven an undertaking to the United States Government that, while we would not make a change until after the Rio Conference, wewould do so later on.We were now being pressed by the United States Governmenton the matter. The Foreign Secretary, although not anxious tomake a change, thought that we must fulfil our undertaking, andthat we should ask the Swiss Government to take charge of our interests in Japan..      The War Cabinet-Agreed with this course, and invited the Foreign Secretaryto proceed accordingly. ,[23628]

The Prime Minister informed- the War Cabinet that hehad received a telegram from the Lord Privy Seal reporting thaithere was a considerable amount of information available in india as to what had happened at Singapore before and at the time of itsfall; and suggesting that enquiry should be made by takingevidence which could be sent home. The Viceroy was willing tohave an enquiry made. , .The Prime Minister said that he had replied, - agreeing that information about Singapore should be collected, if possible by anOfficer of the Intelligence Staff, but without involving the Viceroy.The Prime Minister also referred to the following Motionwhich had been put down : &quot;Singapore, That in the Opinion of this House a special commission should be appointed to enquire into the prepara-tions made for the defence and the operations resulting in theloss of Malaya and Singapore, and the report of the Commis1-sion, when completed, should be presented to both Houses ofParliament.&quot; ;General Wavell could, of course, be asked to submit a report,but the Prime Minister felt that it would be a mistake to troublehim to do so at the present time. While it would be right that theGovernment should take.such steps as were open to them to collectinformation on the matter, anything in the nature of a formalenquiry, such as that proposed in the Motion, was out of thequestion at the present time.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.India.    , 4.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he(Previous had received a telegram from Sir Stafford Cripps on SundayReference: morning proposing an alteration to paragraph (e) of the draft&apos;W.M. (42) 31st Declaration (W.P. (42) 114). There had been no time to convene theConclusions, War Cabinet or the India Committee, and he had taken the minute 1.)        responsibility of approving the proposed amendment.^ The amend-ment had later been endorsed by the members of the india committee.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Far East. 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the civilians Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (42) 135) coveringevacuated a Report prepared by representatives of the various Departmentsfrom the concerned, dealing with the present position of civilians who hadFar East to       been evacuated from the Far East and were now in certain of the qrn^ons,        Dominions or in India.   The representatives of the departments and India.        concerned, other than the India Office, recommended that a policyof &quot; stay put &quot; should be adopted as regards all refugees from,.V Colonies and other places occupied or threatened by the enemy andas regards persons now resident in those territories for whom theUnited Kingdom Government or a Colonial Government was responsible:       - *. .l?hje.)Secfiepf[$y o,fs$taie fox the. Colonies said that this recom-mendation went^ far beyond, the immediate problem, namely, 2,000civilians evacuated from Hong Kong and 9,000 from Malaya. Thepolicy of &quot;stay put,&quot; as set out in paragraph 5 (i) of theMemorandum, would make it impossible for a Colonial officialtransferred from, say, West Africa to the West Indies to take his family with him. /
The Secretary of State for India pointed out the difficulties with which India would be faced if the refugees who had reached that country from Burma and the Far East were to remain in thatcountry. .The general view of the War Cabinet was that, to the extent that facilities were available, British civilians evacuated from theFar East should not be debarred from returning to this country,where this was the course which they would naturally follow(e,g., in cases where they had homes or family connections here).The War Cabinet were informed that hitherto the rule hadbeen that, if any appreciable number of passengers were carried inreturning troopships, the ships must be escorted. The present practice whereby these ships returned without escort would have tocontinue, even if they carried refugees from the Far East.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) The determining factor in this matter must be the extentto which transport facilities could be made availablewithout appreciable interference with the war effort.(2) &apos;Subject to (1), arrangements should be made to facilitate the return to this country of British civilians evacuated from the Far East in cases in which this was the naturalcourse, e.g.. those who had homes or family connectionshere.(3) The existing rules in regard to the number of civilianpassengers allowed in returning troopships should be modified so as to permit of the gradual return to thiscountry of those covered by (2).(4) It should be made clear to those offered passages that the returning troopships would proceed unescorted.(5) The facilities should not be used, without further authority,to bring to the United Kingdom any foreigners or any british subjects who had no connections with, orreasonable claim to be brought to, this country.(6) The Secretary of State for the Colonies was asked toarrange for a meeting of representatives of the Depart-ments concerned, to draw up a revised scheme fordealing with the matter on the basis of the above decisions.Great George Street, S.W.1,March 30, 1942:
