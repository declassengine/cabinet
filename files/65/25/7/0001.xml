The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury stated thatcertain Members of Parliament had expressed a desire for a debate on aerodrome defence. If the Cabinet acceded to this request,Thursday, the 22nd January, might be allotted for the purpose. Hethought Members might wish to discuss not merely the new organi-sation proposed for aerodrome defence (which could be discussed in public), but also the methods of defending aerodromes. In thi$latter case a Secret Session would probably be necessary. IThe War Cabinet-Invited the Parliametary Secretary to the Treasury tomake further enquiries regarding the matters which it was desired to discuss in Debate, and to report to the WarCabinet on the following Monday.4. The War Cabinet were informed by the Lord Privy Sealand the Foreign Secretary of further discussions on this subject,the record of which is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.5. The Lord Privy Seal said that late on the previous nighta further telegram had been received from the Prime Minister onthis matter (Grey 340). It was clear that there had been some misunderstanding, and he had accordingly sent a message to theeffect that, as now explained, he (the Lord Privy Seal) was inagreement with the scheme proposed by the Prime Minister, andthat he understood that he (the Prime Minister) was informing theGovernments concerned.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.6. The War Cabinet were informed that enquiries which hadbeen made at the Ministry of Information showed that the state-ment as to troop movements published in a newspaper on the13th January had consisted of a quotation from an Australiannewspaper. Further, it appeared that there was no provision under existing procedure to deal with the publication here of extracts from newspapers published in the Dominions.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Information to enquire into thismatter and to report to them at their meeting on thefollowing Monday.7. The Minister of Labour and National Service said that hehad noticed, several recent criticisms to the effect that insufficientattention had been, and was being, paid by the authorities here to production in Australia. First, it was alleged that Australia hadbeen encouraged to set up facilities for the production of 25-pounderguns, of which an ample supply was now available,1 Secondly, that more should have been done to stimulate production of aircraft inAustralia.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service, as chairman of the Production Executive, to ascertain thefacts and report on the position generally.
