The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet a general account of his visit to the United States, He, the Minister ofSupply and the Chiefs of Staff had been received throughout withthe greatest kindness. He had lived on the closest personal terms with the President. The United States Administration weretackling war problems with the greatest vigour, and were clearlyresolved not to be diverted from using all the resources of theircountry to the utmost to crush Hitler, our major enemy.The Prime Minister gave an account of the general course ofthe discussions which had taken place. Among the most importantresults had been the decision to set up (1) a Combined RawMaterials Board, and (2) two Committees, one in London and one in Washington, to deal with munition assignments; (3) Anglo-American Shipping Adjustment Boards both in Washington andin London. The idea underlying all these bodies was that theresources of Great Britain and the United States were regarded asa common pool to be used for the prosecution of the war. A paper setting out particulars of these bodies would be circulated to theCabinet for consideration at their meeting on Monday. It had beenagreed that for the present no public announcement would be madein regard to these bodies, which would be subject to review in, say,a month&apos;s time, in the light of experience gained of their working.There had been virtually no discussion in regard to thequestion of consideration under the Lease-Lend Agreement.The Prime Minister said that he had taken the line that thisquestion need not be settled as a matter of urgency, and that he hadnot been pressed on the point.The War Cabinet was given some information as to theAmerican attitude towards strategic problems. This is recorded inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Parliament. 2.   The Prime Minister suggested that at the meeting of the(Previous House on Tuesday, the 20th January, he should say that he wouldDeference: like further time to prepare his statement to the House, and that.M. (42) 4th he hoped he would not be pressed to make a statement until Tuesday,Conclusions, the 27th January.   There might then, he thought, be a debate of,Minute 9.) say, two days&apos; duration on the war situation.The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury said thatthere might be some demand for a statement by the Prime Ministerat an earlier date, but that this demand would probably be satisfiedif a debate, extending for three days, was offered. This suggestionmet with general approval.The War Cabinet agreed with the course proposed and authorised the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury to make arrangements on this basis, with latitudeas to the form which the debate should take.Burma. 3.   The War Cabinet were informed of the circumstancesU Saw. which had led to the detention of U Saw in Palestine.   The termsof the draft announcement which it was proposed should be madewere read out.The War Cabinet authorised the Secretary of State for burma to arrange for an announcement in the terms proposed to be issued on Monday morning as fromNo. 10 Downing Street.
Military 4.   The War  Cabinet were  informed  that Halfaya had operations. surrendered and 5,500 prisoners had been captured. Altogether,Libya. 14,000 prisoners had been taken in Bardia, Sollum and Halfaya at very slight loss to ourselves.The Prime Minister asked that no comparative statement ofthe total casualties on both sides, since our offensive in the western desert had been started on the 18th November, should be published in advance of his statement on the 27th January.Great George Street, S.W. 1,January 17, 1942.

They were not above learning from us,provided   that we did not set out to teach them.The State Department was apt to be somewhat jumpy,and had. been very much upset over the action taken byGeneral de Gaulle at St. Pierre and Miquelon.The Americans were setting about the war with greatvigour.   Lord Beaverbrook had. performed   the most valuable

service in getting them to extend greatly the production programmes which they had in mind.   The fact that these programmes had now been published would provide a stimulus to their fulfilment.The Prime Minister, in referring to   the threeinstruments which had been prepared (dealing with munitionsassignments, shipping and raw materials), said that thePresident had said that he did not much mind what appearedon paper, since he (the President), the Prime Minister,Mr Harry Hopkins and Lord Beaverbrook would, be able tocompose any difficulties which might arise.The Prime Minister said that these Agreements were,in his view, wholly favourable to us.    In practice, as wewere already fully engaged in the war, our resources wouldnot be drawn upon.    In assessing the value of these instru-ments, regard should be had. to the personalities behind them as regards the appointment of a Supreme commander in the Par East, the Prime Minister said, that at first hehad been against this proposal,   which nad been strongly urged by General Marshall, who had made a great impression on him in   a talk on the matter which had lasted for an hourThe suggestion that General Wavell should, be appointed as supreme Commander came from the Americans .   The beneficialresults of this appointment had already been seen.   GeneralWavell1 s telegrams since his arrival in Batavia had giventhe greatest.confidence.On   the suggestion that an Australian Minister should,have a seat in the War Cabinet, the Prime Minister saidthat he thought before this was considered, the Australiansought to lay aside their Party feud and set up a national government.Incidental reference was made to the request of Mr R.Stokes, M.P., to visit Turkey.    In view of Mr Stokes&apos;attitude, the view taken was that this request should be refused.Great George Street, S.W.I.
