Far Bast 2.   The Lord Privy Seal reminded the War Cabinet thatAllied Annex II of the Directive issued to General Wavell (as approvedCo-ordination. by the Prime Minister and the President) had laid down the(Previous procedure whereby hevwould be responsible to the A.B.D.A. Govern-w ivrence: ments. On all important military matters not within the jurisdic-ConoiuJ^138th tion of the Supreme Commander, the United States Chiefs of StaffMinute^T anc* rePresentatives in Washington of the British Chiefs of staff would constitute an agency for developing and submitting recom-mendations for decisions by the President of the United States andthe British Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Since,however, London had machinery for consulting the DominionGovernments, and since the Dutch Government was in London, theBritish Government would be responsible for obtaining their views and agreements and including these in the final telegrams to washington,St. Pierre and 1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to theMiguelon. two telegrams which had been sent to the Prime Minister (Taut 499(Previous and 502) about the proposals in telegram Grey 305.w m&quot;TIsi 4+1 ^e nad since sPoken to tne Prime Minister on the telephone.W.M. (42) 4tn   Copies were handed round of a reply which had just been receivedttSSnT&apos;      from the Prime Minister (Grey 330).&quot;  [Lord Halifax&apos;s telegramNo. 244, referred to in Grey 330, had not yet been received.]In discussion, the following points were made : (i) The general view of the War Cabinet was that, althoughAdmiral Muselier appeared satisfied with the existingCouncil, on the whole it was desirable that new elections for a new Council should be held as proposed inGrey 330.(ii) Strong objection was seen to action by the United states to enforce a settlement and to appoint a Trustee if general de Gaulle did not consent to the terms suggestedThis would produce a thoroughly bad impression inCanada and in the West Indies.(iii) The Foreign Secretary, when he saw General de Gaulle,should take the line that the Free French were being given the substance of their requirements, viz., an administration in St. Pierre and Miquelon which wouldbe thoroughly sympathetic to the Free French cause. Itwould be a grave error for- them to hold out for the shadow and to reject the substance.(iv) It would be. wrong to impose a settlement on general de Gaulle until everything possible had been done by themethod of friendly discussion. If the General putforward any reasonable proposals, they should beconsidered.(v) Although   it   had   been   stated   in   Grey   305   thatMr. Mackenzie King was prepared to accept any solution which commended itself to the Prime Ministerand President Roosevelt, there should be further formalconsultation with the Canadian Government on theterms of settlement.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to see general de Gaulle and to endeavour to persuade him toaccept the arrangement set out in telegrams Grey 305and Grey 330, subject to the points made in discussion.(6) Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to settle in consultation the terms of the reply to be sent to Grey 330, bearing in mind (v) above.
The importance of consultations with these Governments takingplace in London had been emphasised in several later telegrams from the Prime Minister (Grey 258, 275 and 313).This matter was linked up with the question of closer -operation in London with the Dominion Governments which he(the Lord Privy Seal) and the Dominions Secretary had discussedseveral times with Sir Earle Page. As a result of these discussions,a telegram had been sent to the Prime Minister (Taut No. 503)1copies of which had been circulated to the War Cabinet. this telegram provided for a system of Dominion Liaison Officers,comparable in status to the Joint Planning Staff, who would beadmitted to consultations with that Staff at early stages of consideration of plans, in order that they might be kept fully informed as to progress and could call attention to points of specialDominion interest from the outset.The Prime Minister had referred to this telegram in a telegram received late the previous night (Grey 325) proposing the formationin London of a Council of the Far East on the Ministerial plane.The Lord Privy Seal said that he and the Dominions secretary had discussed the matter on the previous night and had come to theconclusion that, while there was an advantage in setting up a body which could be described as a Far Eastern Defence Council, it was important that in substance this Council should be the existingDefence Committee, with the addition of representatives ofAustralia, New Zealand and the Dutch on the Ministerial plane.The advisers to this Committee would be the Chiefs of Staff, andit was important to avoid having at meetings of this Committee orCouncil a multiplicity of technical advisers of varying status. Inview of the need for speed, a telegram (Taut No. 522) embodyingthese essential points had been despatched early that morning.After discussion, the War Cabinet 1Expressed their agreement with the telegrams which hadbeen despatched and endorsed the action taken.Discussion ensued as to whether the proposed Dominion liaison officers ought to be not merely in a position to consult with the joint planning Staff, but closely and integrally associated with that Staff.It was urged that, from the point of view of the DominionGovernments, the latter arrangement was very desirable. On theother hand, it was pointed out by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs that Sir Earle Page had not asked, for more thanthe appointment of Dominion Liaison Officers. It was also of theutmost importance that nothing should be done to impede the swiftworking of the Joint Planning Staff. In any event, it was agreedthat it would be premature to consider this aspect of the matteruntil further information had been received about the PrimeMinister&apos;s discussion in Washington as to the co-ordination of theAllied war effort generally.Air Raids.Damage and casualties.^previous reference:W.M. (42) 4thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityreported &quot;tip-and-run&quot; raids by single aircraft on the13th January at Eedcar, where bombs had been dropped on DormanLong&apos;s ironworks, and in the shopping centre of Lowestoft. Thelatest report as to the casualties was Detained m   SlightlyBedcarLowestoftKilled.1027Hospital.635Injured.1040The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested that,in the interests of maintaining steel productioa, enquiry should be
made as to whether any improvement was called for in the active and passive air defences on the North-East coast, more particularly to ensure a state of readiness to meet attacks at short notice.The War Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of home security and the Secretary of State for Air to look intothis matter.The Press. 4.   Reference was made to a statement published in thePublication of Daily Express of the 13th January referring to certain possiblePossible Troop troop movements. This statement took the form of a quotation fromMovements.      a report that had been published in an Australian newspaper.  Thequestion of how this information had come to be published inAustralia had already been taken up.There remained the question of why this information had been allowed to be published in this country.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security undertook to make enquiries of the Ministry of Information on this point.Great George Street, S.
