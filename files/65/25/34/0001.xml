The Foreign Secretary gave the War Cabinet the latest information as to discussions with the U.S.S.R., including an interview which he had had with M. Maisky.3. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to reports in thepress of statements made by Major-General Gordon Bennett, whohad commanded the Australians in Malaya. One of these to theeffect that he was sure that Australian prisoners would be welltreated by the Japanese had already been used for propaganda purposes by the enemy. Another, reported in that evening&apos;s paper,reflected&apos;on the Imperial authorities. Such statements were clearlyundesirable and should be stopped.The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs to bring this matter to the notice of the Prime minister with the suggestion that he should send a message to Mr. Curtin.;.    4.   The First Lord of the Admiralty reported the latestdevelopment of the dispute between General de Gaulle and Admiral Muselier.   He feared that, unless the matter was firmly handled,W.M. (42) 32nd ^ne Free French Movement might be split from top to bottom.Conclusions, The Foreign Secretary thought that we should have to chooseMinute 7.) Detween-(i) Continuing; to insist upon Admiral Muselier retaining hispost as Commander-in-Chief of&apos; the Free French Navy.He thought that the Admiral had put himself in the wrong and that we were unlikely to secure this, except at the cost of General de Gaulle throwing in his hand.Free France.(previous reference:1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the main events of the past week. -Essen, Kiel, Emden and Cologne had been bombed. Eighteenof our bombers were missing. Tn the Home Theatre we had destroyed 25 enemy aircraft for certain, 9 probable and 9 damagedfor the loss of 10 fighter aircraft. In addition, 14 Spitfires hadcrashed owing to bad weather when returning from an operation,two pilots being killed.There were indications that the Germans might resume nightbombing on this country. The Chief of the Air Staff undertook tokeep the Home Secretary informed on this point.Heavy air attacks on Malta continued.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to inform the Ministerof Labour and National Service of the arrangements made forservicing aircraft on the Burma front.Allied shipping losses in the preceding seven days totalled205,000 tons. The Defence Committee were examining that weekfurther counter-measures against U-boats.Details were given of operations and troop dispositions in the pacific, in Burma arid in Libya.Although there had been heavy fighting on the Russian front,not much progress had been made. There seemed no doubt that theRussian attacks were impeding German attempts to withdraw their forces in order to re-equip them for a Spring offensive. eThe War Cabinet took note of these statements.
5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChairman of the Wireless Telegraphy Board (W.P. (42) 121).The Postmaster-General explained that it must be assumed that no security attached to messages sent by radio-telephone,notwithstanding the various devices introduced. Further, phrasesused casually in telephone conversations might, if pieced togetherby an enemy Intelligence Service, be of much greater value to theenemy than would appear from the context.One way in which the radio-telephone could be used safely andto advantage was to telegraph in cypher a memorandum in short,numbered paragraphs, and then to conduct the conversation by reference to those paragraphs.The War Cabinet-Instructed the Secretary to arrange for the contents of theMemorandum to be brought to the attention of all ministers who had occasion to make use of radio-telephony,with a request that they should also bring it to the noticeof those members of their staffs who had occasion to useradio-telephony.6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (42) 123),In discussion, agreement was expressed with the view that itwas desirable to avoid action which might foster the growth of an extreme Welsh Nationalist movement.It was pointed out that the Ministry of Labour and NationalService and :the Fighting Services went to great trouble to ensurethat Welsh-speaking men were posted to Welsh-speaking units., The general view was that, while it was right, when setting upCommittees or similar bodies, that consideration should be given tothe question whether a Welsh man or woman should be included,this principle could not be pressed too far, and no hard-and-fastrule could be laid down.The War Cabinet-Agreed that a suitable reminder on these lines should besent to all Departments. &apos; ;(ii) Negotiating a new agreement with General de Gaulle,whereby we should obtain a more satisfactory generalarrangement in regard to the Free French national committee and also a better control over the free french Navy. Under this alternative a command wouldbe found elsewhere for Admiral Muselier.The War Cabinet- .(1) Postponed a decision pending the result of the interview- which Admiral  Dickens was having with general de Gaulle.(2) Asked the First Lord of the Admiralty to arrange that admiral Muselier should, for the present, stay away from London.
