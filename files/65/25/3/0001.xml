A discussion took place on this matter, which is recordedRelations with   in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.the vichy government.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 57thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (W.P. (41) 260) in regard to the bombing of certain factories in occupied France known to be engaged in themanufacture of munitions supplies for the enemy.In discussion, the Secretary of State for Air said that the factthat we had refrained from bombing these factories was regardedas weakness on our part by many French people. The HomeSecretary had drawn his attention to the importance of the aircraft which carried out these operations also dropping some leaflets.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed with the view set out in the memorandum that steps should now be taken to bogp these factories.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to convey this view to thePrime Minister and to ask him, if he agreed with it, toarrange for the United States Government to be notified.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Air to settle, in consultation, the warning to begiven, in general terms, to French workers, to the effectthat French factories engaged on the production ofmunitions of war for the enemy would be bombed.Ubemarle 1.Aircraft.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (42) 14) setting out certain proposals, submitted informally on behalf of the Canadian Govern-ment, as to this country&apos;s present and future indebtedness to canada.It was explained in the Memorandum that the Canadian offer details of which were given was a very generous one. One feature of it, however, presented difficulty, namely, the suggestion that theUnited Kingdom Government should give collateral security inrespect of a loan to us by another Empire Government.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that such % prc^cedure was without precedent in relations between any BritishEmpire Governments; its adoption would, moreover, be likelyinvolve us in serious practical difficulties. &apos;    &apos;..The Chancellor proposed that he and the Dominions Secretary^should send a telegram to. Canada, making clear our objection,, tathis particular feature of these proposals, but leaving no doubt ofour appreciation of the generosity of the offer.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs to send a telegram on thelines proposed.german atrocities.(previous reference:W.M.. (42) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3.)5.   The War Cabinet-Took note of a proposed Allied declaration on German;Atrocities (W.P. (42) 13) to be adopted at the Meeting at;St. James&apos;s Palace on the 13th January, and agreed that1its terms were unobjectionable.Civilian 6.   The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said&quot;&apos;Respirators. that a request for 500,000 civilian respirators had been received^Demands from from the Dominion of Canada, and another request for the same &apos;Overseas. number from Singapore.   (A request from Australia for 1 millioncontainers had already been agreed to, a,s there was a surplus ofcontainers.)   We had reserves of 16 million respirators in this ;country.  This was none too many in the event of serious gas attack;ion this country.   Current production was at the rate of 200,000 aweek, but might be affected by the rubber position.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) We should not dissipate our reserves of civilian respiratorsuntil the total demands likely to be made on them hadbeen ascertained and their priority assessed. (Possibledemands from Burma and the Netherlands East Indieswere referred to in this connection.)(2) The l%me Secretary and Minister of Home Security was authorised to arrange for the despatch of 500,000civilian respirators to Singapore, since this demandobviously took very high priority, subject to his being satisfied that the full number was required.(3) The Canadian demand stood in a far lower priority.Nevertheless, in view of Canada&apos;s generous attitude inother respects, there might be advantage in making a token issue.Great George Street, S.W. 1,January 8, 1942.
