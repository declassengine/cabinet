Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 1stConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.Shipping LossesMilitaryOperations.Far East.Libya.Bussia.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.[23315]1.   The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 852-855: Summary of aircraft losses since the 2nd January, 1942Home Theatre Enemy 3 destroyed.Our Own 4 destroyed.Middle East Enemy 10 destroyed.3 probable.16 possible.Our Own 18 destroyed (7 on the ground).Far East-Enemy 9 destroyed (6 on the ground).Our Own 6 destroyed.The first convoy of reinforcements had reached Singapore onthe 3rd January.The December shipping losses to date, including the Pacific(120,000 tons), amounted to 239,000 tons. It might be necessary to add some 18,000-20,000 tons to this total.On the west coast of Malaya we had withdrawn 15 to 20 miles to meet sea-borne threats to our communications. In the philippines, Manila had been occupied by the enemy. UnitedStates forces were to the west of the town. In Burma we hadreoccupied Bokpyn.At Agedabia our forces, which were operating some 400 to500 miles in front of their rail-heads, were severely limited by thesupply problem. The ports of Tobruk, Derna and Benghazi were now being operated, but so far only on a small scale. Our losses in the action at Agedabia amounted to 50 officers, 350 other ranks and 60 tanks. In Bardia we had captured 7,468 prisoners(including 1,000 Germans) and 1,150 of our own prisoners had beenrecovered.On the night of the 30th/31st December Special Air ServiceTroops had operated with the Long-Range Desert Group and had destroyed twenty-seven enemy aircraft on Temed landing ground and two more at Nofilia.The Russian advances north and south of Moscow showedtendency towards an enveloping movement. The German &quot; militaryspokesman &quot; on the previous day had stated that the shortenedGerman winter line had been formed and would be held. At theeastern end of the Crimea, Russian army, navy and air forces hadco-operated in a successful attack on the Kerch Peninsula, and thearea east of Feodosia was now clear of the enemy.
Air Policy.Enemy-occupied territory.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 104thConclusions,Minute 2.)Foreign Affairs.(PreviousKeference:W.M. (42) 1stConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The War Cabinet agreed that the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (W.P. (41) 260) on attacks on factories in occupied France should be considered at an early meeting of theWar Cabinet.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 106thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing information : Timor. Sir R. Campbell had arrived in this country andwould stay until a reply had been received to the telegram sentto the Australian Government asking for their assent to theplan that the Australian-Dutch contingent should be with-drawn on the arrival of the Portuguese reinforcements.The Foreign Secretary said that reflection confirmed him in the view that our force would have to be withdrawn on the arrival of Portuguese reinforcements. It was, however, pro-posed to couple with this the suggestion that we should at oncehave Staff talks with the Portuguese as to the action to betaken if they required our assistance in Timor.German Atrocities Proposed Declaration. The foreign secretary recalled that on the 27th October, 1941, the WarCabinet had decided that, in view of the Statements made bythe Prime Minister and President Roosevelt, it was unnecessary to proceed with a joint declaration, but that we need not objectif the Allies wished to issue a statement on their own account.It was proposed that the declaration should be signed at st.. James&apos;s Palace. The United States, the U.S.S.R., theDominions and ourselves would be represented, but would notsign the declaration, which he thought was not open to serious objection. The Allies were anxious that the meeting should beheld at an early date.  The 13th January was proposed.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate the draft AlliedStatement to the War Cabinet, and agreed that arrange-ments should proceed for the meeting to be held at st.. James&apos;s Palace on the 13th January.diplomatic service.Question ofAdmittingWomen.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wasbeing pressed to make a statement as regards the entry of womeninto the Diplomatic Service. He proposed, if his colleagues agreed,to say that, as all regular entry into the Service was suspendedduring the war, there could be no question of admitting women intothe Diplomatic or Consular Services now. Changes in these services would, however, have to come into operation after the war,and the matter could then be further considered. In the meantime,a war-time measure, he was prepared to consider applicationsasfrom women, as well as from men, for temporary posts of theadministrative grade in the Foreign Office when vacancies occurred.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to make a statement onthe above lines.
Egypt.egyptian government&apos;sGold Reserve.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 104thConclusions,Minute 7.)The Blockade.Greece.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 134thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 6) proposing thathis Department should be authorised to concert with the Ministryof Economic Warfare as to the best method of promoting shipments of wheat from Turkey to Greece, on the general understanding thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government had no connection with such shipmentsand were involved only to the extent of a private undertaking to theTurkish Government to replace the grain so shipped.Discussion turned mainly on the question whether a concession could be made in the case of Greece without creating a wide breachin our whole blockade policy.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister of Economic Warfare to discuss the matter further, with a view to making an agreed recommendation to the War Cabinet.Royal Navy. 7.   The War Cabinet had before them Auxiliary air- (a) A Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiraltycraft carriers. (W.P. (41) 308) drawing attention to the results obtained by the use of auxiliary carriers of the Audacity type asescorts to convoys; and proposing that eight further fastvessels should be converted to auxiliary carriers. these would be capable of operating aircraft by night. *(b) A Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport(W.P. (42) 1) drawing attention to the difficulty ofsparing vessels of the types for which the First lord was asking without endangering our import pro-gramme.The Minister of War Transport said that only four large fastvessels of the required type and delivery dates were now under construction in this country. Of these, two were being fitted asrefrigerated ships, of which we stood badly in need. It was alsodifficult to decide this matter until we had further details of thedecisions now being reached in Washington on large issues, any ofwhich might materially affect the shipping position. The Ministeralso suggested that the Admiralty should press the United states authorities to make available the vessels which they required.The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to the cuts- already made in the naval shipbuilding programme.  Again, owingto the absence of auxiliary carriers, Fleet aircraft-carriers had oftenhad to be employed in transporting aircraft to foreign stationsinstead of fulfilling a fighting role.The War Cabinet-Invited the Defence Committee (Operations) to report onthis matter, after taking into account other likely demands on our shipping resources.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W-P- (42) 5) recommending that His Majesty&apos;s Government should facilitate the removal ofthe Egyptian Governments gold reserve by giving a guarantee against its loss in transit.The War Cabinet-(i) Agreed that there was no objection in principle to theremoval of the gold at this juncture,(ii) Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs togive the required guarantee on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and to instruct Sir Miles Lampson tocomplete the necessary arrangements, subject to the availability of a proper escort, as to which advice shouldbe obtained from the Naval Staff.
Production.Management ofFillingFactories.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 133rdConclusions,-Minute 9.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply (W.P. (42) 4).This Memorandum set out the revised arrangements proposed withthe two firms chosen for the management of the two new filling factories most nearly at the point of going into production. Theagreements with the firms had been modified so as to provide thatthey would manage the factories on behalf of the Ministry ofSupply for an initial period of six months. The Ministry would thus be able to absorb the factories completely into the R.O.F.organisation as soon as they were satisfied that the factories were running concerns.It was stated in discussion that it was proposed to makeagreements on the same lines in regard to three other filling factoriesnow approaching completion. One of the firms previouslyapproached was likely to drop out, and it was proposed to ask theCo-operative Wholesale Society to take its place.The War Cabinet-Approved the arrangements proposed in W.P. (42) 4, and agreed that similar arrangements should be made in regardto three other filling factories now approaching completion.disabled persons.Rehabilitation,training andemployment.9. The War Cabinet-Approved the terms of a draft announcement (in the formof a Question and Answer in the House) in regard to the rehabilitation, training and employment of disabled persons, set out in a Memorandum bv the Minister ofLabour and National Service (W.P. (G&apos;) (41) 160).Parliament.Arrangementsfor the Recess.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 128thConclusions,Minute 3.)Arrangementsfor Debate on8tli January.10. The War Cabinet discussed the statement to be made bythe Lord Privy Seal at the meeting of Parliament on the8th January.The War Cabinet agreed that the Lord Privy Seal should makea statement in Secret Session to the effect that Parliament wouldreassemble on the date previously suggested and proceed with theordinary business of the House. The date in question should not bemade public at this stage.The War Cabinet agreed that the Lord Privy Seal should makea general statement, putting in perspective the various events which had taken place, but deprecating any detailed discussion ofthe decisions reached in the United States pending the PrimeMinisters return. The Lord Privy Seal would deal incidentally inhis speech with the question of the protection of aerodromes. TheForeign Secretary would wind up the Debate, and either theSecretary of State for Air or the Secretary of State for War wouldbe ready to deal with any questions which might be raised in regardto aerodrome defence arising out of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;sstatement.ConsiderationunderLease-Lend.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 1stConclusions,Minute 6.)11.   The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister without Portfolio and the Chancellorof the Exchequer to submit memoranda on this subject,but deferred a decision as to future procedure.Great George Street, S.W. 1,January 5, 1942.
