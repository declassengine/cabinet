The Western 1.   The Prime Minister said that the War Cabinet would haveFront. seen the Minutes of the Meeting held in the Admiralty Upper WarProgress of Room, at 8-15 p.m. the previous evening (D.O. (40) 4th Meeting),operations. These Minutes contained the text of the letter received from(Previous General Dill, and of the message which the Chief of the ImperialReference:        General Staff had taken to Lord Gort.W.M. (40) 130th        The Prime Minister said that he had spoken to General IronsideConclusions,      on the telephone that morning.   The latter had given the WarMinute 1.)        Cabinefs message to Lord Gort.   Everything possible would bedone to help the Belgian Army which would have to conform to^the British movements.The Prime Minister had also had a message from GeneralSwayne at General Georges&apos; headquarters, who had been very glad to hear of the British decision. It was not clear what ordersGeneral Georges had intended to give as regards the movement ofthe B.E.F. It was possible that the matter had been left in thehands of General Billotte, who was in command of the French left,but with whom Lord Gort did not appear to be in touch at themoment. Lord Gort was moving three divisions down to the Lensarea, but anticipated that it would take 48 hours to complete the move.   The roads were very badly congested with refugees.The Secretary of State for War said that Lord Gort had informed the War Office that German mechanised units wereadvancing on Arras, which was held by the partially trained23rd Division. The B.E.F. were holding the line of the Scheldtfrom Oudenard to St. Amand. It appeared probable that a german attack would be made during the course of the afternoon. TheBritish troops were tired, but in very good heart.The War Office felt that there was very little chance of theBelgian Army being able to conform to the movements of the B.E.F.Their communications were very bad and they were withoutmechanical transport. The Chief of the Imperial General staff would probably return to this country that night; and it was pro-posed that General Dill should also return. It would be valuableto obtain his view of the situation. He could go back to France on the following day, if necessary.The Assistant Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that lord Gort would be faced with considerable maintenance difficultiesowing to the fact that the Germans had broken our communicationson the line Amiens-Albert-Bapaume. Moreover, as a result of the capture of Bapaume, an important ammunition depot in the forward area had been lost. Maintenance had been shifted to a line further north; and a number of small vessels with stores were being held at48 hours&apos; notice in case it became necessary to supply the troops through the Channel ports. Base organisation at these ports wouldhave to be improvised.In reply to a question, he said that the French forces wereforming a defensive front along the River Aisne towards Peronne,but had not yet assembled sufficiently strong forces for a counter-attack. It appeared certain that the main German thrust was inthe direction of Arras.General Evans, the Commander of the Armoured Division now on its way to France, had landed at Havre with his staff. He had reported that he was not yet in touch with the High Command inFrance. The convoy with the first units of the Armoured division hand been diverted to Cherbourg. They would presumably be takenforward to the battle area by train.The First Lord of the Admiralty added that Havre had been subjected to intense air attack. Many fires had been started in thetown and the docks had been seriously damaged. All traffic onthe river between Rouen and the coast was held up owing tomagnetic mines.[21309] b 2Britisharmoureddivision.
The Prime Minister thought that as a precautionary measure the Admiralty should assemble a large number of small vessels in readiness to proceed to ports and inlets on the French coast.The Lord President of the Council asked whether the blockingof Ostend and Zeebrugge should now be carried out.The Chief of Naval Staff said that personnel could beembarked at Zeebrugge but not at Ostend, after the blockingoperations.Air operations. The Chief of the Air Staff said that in the previous day&apos;s air fighting we had shot down 26 German aircraft and possibly 8 more,with a loss of 12 Hurricanes.A number of bombing operations had been carried out on theprevious night against the following targets : (i) Road  and Rail  targets at Hal,  Nivelles,  Roux  andGembloux.(ii) The Ardennes Forest area.(iii) Hydrogenation plants in the Ruhr.(iv) Oil Refineries at Salzbergen.Two of our aircraft were missing.The Advanced Air Striking Force had attacked enemy con-concentrations between the Rivers Serre and Aisne.Owing to the congestion on aerodromes in France, some of theair component squadrons had been withdrawn to operate from Kent.During the previous 24 hours our total losses of bombers and fightersin combat amounted to 23 aircraft. It must be remembered,however, that in addition to machines shot down there was alwaysa considerable number damaged in combat or on the ground. the wastage rate was extremely high. As an indication of the extentof wastage, only 10 or 12 fighters out of the 48 recently sent toFrance were at present in action. Whenever possible, damagedaircraft were flown back to this country.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Blocking ofOstend andZeebrugge.The Western 2.

There had been trouble with the crew of S.S. Royal Ulsterman,Narvik carrying ammunition to Narvik.   They had refused to sail withoutoperations. more anti-aircraft escort, and when they had been assured that thiswould be provided, they had still refused on the ground that the shipcontained ammunition. The crew had been removed under arrestand the ship had now sailed manned by naval ratings.The Prime Minister expressed disappointment with the progressof operations at Narvik, which were causing a heavy drain on our resources in equipment and shipping. In his view, the operations were not being pressed hard enough, and the War Cabinet should perhaps consider the despatch of a direct order to Lord Cork to takeNarvik by assault.The First Lord of the Admiralty read a signal which had been dispatched to Lord Cork the previous day giving him a strongindication of the urgency of clearing up Narvik at the earliestpossible moment. He suggested that the reply to this signal shouldbe awaited before any decision was taken to send a direct orderto Lord Cork.The Secretary of State for War said that the slowness of theoperations was due to weather conditions. Three feet of meltingsnow handicapped all movement. The Germans, who were holdingdefensive positions, were less impeded by this than assaultingtroops.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the PrimeMinister suggested that the Chiefs of Staff should now consider carefully whether we were likely to get a dividend out of our occupation of Narvik, even after we had succeeded in capturing it.It was clear that the troops, ships and equipment occupied in theoperation were urgently needed elsewhere.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the whole problem was now under examination by the Chiefs of Staff.Air operations. Following a report that 200  aircraft had  been  seen  atVaernes aerodrome (Trondhjem), machine-gun attacks had beenmade during the day and bombing attacks at night. Details ofthese attacks were not yet available.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Spain. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the(Previous Spanish situation was moving rapidly.   With the approval of the reference: Prime Minister, he had informed Sir Samuel Hoare that the soonerW.M. (40) 127th he reached Madrid the better.

Communist discontent[21309] B 3
was directed against the inefficiency of the food and similaradministrations, which were in the hands of the Falangists who,as a body, were reaping the discredit. Neither was the Duke ofAlba anxious regarding the possibility of a part of the Armyrevolting against General Franco&apos;s administration.German The Duke of Alba had added that General Franco was keepingactivities in a close watch on possible Fifth Column activities on the part of spain. the Germans in Spain.  The Foreign Secretary had told the SpanishAmbassador that we thought the number of Germans in Spain wasexcessive, and that we hoped that a close watch would continueto be kept over their activities.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the contraband Master of the Rolls would arrive in Rome the following night tocontrol. start discussions on contraband control.    Sir Wilfrid  Greene(Previous realised the difficulties and dangers which he was incurring, but was reference:        prepared to face them.   If Italy came into the war the ForeignW.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 589 DIPP, dated the 19th May, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome : There was a rumour that if the Germans took Paris,Herr Hitler would then announce the terms on which he wouldconclude peace, and of which he would demand the unconditional acceptance. Signor Mussolini might announcehis entry into the war on Germany&apos;s side if Herr Hitler&apos;s peace terms were rejected. This last was a mere conjecture on thepart of Sir Percy Loraine who thought it was the kind ofblackmailing operation which would appeal to the Duce.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Germany. 8.

This telegram gave information from a reliable sourceattacks. of reports received from Germany on the following points : (i) R.A.F. raids on Germany on the 13th-14th May.(ii) Belief in diplomatic circles in Berlin that there would bea peace offer after the military successes in the low countries and before the &quot; decisive attack &quot; on England.(iii) An appreciation by the German High Command of thegeneral military situation.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
United States ofAmerica.Prospects ofobtainingsupplies of aircraft, &amp;c.(previous reference erences:W.M. (40) 129thConclusions,Minute 8,and 130thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 131, PURCO, dated the 18th May, 1940, fromMr. Purvis, Chairman of the Anglo-French Purchasing Board inthe United States, to M. Monnet, Chairman of the Anglo-french -ordinating Committee, reporting that President Roosevelt hadalready received direct requests regarding certain of the classesof equipment asked for : Stocks of aircraft in the armament of the United states army which the Anglo-French experts felt would be of valuewere limited; they consisted of 150 Curtiss P. 36 Pursuitaircraft and 144 A. 17 A. Northrup bombers. The Army had advised the President that the former represented the onlyplanes available for training purposes, and that their releaseto the Allies would delay the pilot training programme by aperiod of from 4 to 6 months.The release of naval equipment asked for would almost certainly involve Congressional action, for which public opinion in the United States was not yet ripe, though moving rapidly in that direction.The Foreign Secretary added that in his opinion the only chanceof obtaining the equipment we required was through a direct approach fi&apos;om the Prime Minister to President Roosevelt.The War Cabinet-Agreed that a further approach should be made in regardto the supply of aircraft from the United States, and invited the Secretary of State for Air to provide thePrime Minister with a note on the position.Air Defence ofGreat Britain.Despatch of fighter aircraft to France.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 126thConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The War Cabinet had under consideration the Air Defenceof Great Britain generally, with particular reference to the questionof the despatch of fighter aircraft to France. A record of thediscussion, and of the conclusions reached, is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Diversion ofShipping.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 116thConclusions,Minute 1 (e).)11. The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled that at their meeting on the 9th May, the War Cabinet had agreed that &apos;&apos; arrange-ments for the diversion of shipping to the West Coast should beplaced in a state of immediate readiness.&quot;The despatch to the Port Emergency Committees of the codetelegrams authorising them to put the diversion scheme intooperation required the specific authority of the War Cabinet. Timemight not permit of a reference to the War Cabinet and he thought the procedure should be modified to enable a decision to be taken at very short notice.After consulting the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster andthe Minister of Transport, he suggested that the initiative in thematter of raising the question of putting the scheme into force should rest with the First Lord of the Admiralty, who would advise the Minister of Transport when the time had come to take animmediate decision. The Minister of Transport would, if he agreed,despatch the pre-arranged telegrams to the Port emergency committees and the action taken would be reported immediately tothe War Cabinet.
The Prime Minister suggested that it might not be necessaryto order a wholesale diversion of shipping at once. For example,it might be possible to use ports on the East Coast north of theWash, while shipping was diverted from ports on the South-east coast.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster agreed, and saidthat the diversion scheme was exceedingly flexible and could beapplied to groups of ports or a single port as the situation required.The Lord President of the Council thought that the ministers concerned should consult the War Cabinet, if there was time, beforethe action was taken, though he would not object to the procedure proposed by the First Lord of the Admiralty in circumstances of extreme urgency.The War Cabinet agreed : (a) That the initiative in raising the question of putting intooperation the scheme for diversion of shipping should rest with the First Lord of the Admiralty, who would consult the Minister of Transport as soon as he considered that a decision should be taken to introduce the diversion scheme.(6) That if the Minister of Transport agreed that the time had come for the despatch of the pre-arranged telegrams to port Emergency authorities, the Ministers concerned should either (i) seek a decision from the War Cabinet for the intro-duction of the scheme; or(ii) if, in their judgment, time did not permit of a reference to the War Cabinet, themselvesauthorise the despatch of the telegrams, and make an immediate report to the War Cabinet of theaction taken.The netherlands and Belgium.Beception of dutch and belgian WarRefugees.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 128thConclusions,Minute 3.)12. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary on Dutch and Belgian War Refugees (W.P. (G.) (40) 132).The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security explained that the original plans for the reception of not more than 300,000 Dutch and Belgian refugees hadbeen approved before the dangers of parachute warfare and &apos;&apos; fifth column &quot; activities had been fully apparent. The Foreign Officeconsidered that we were now deeply committed to taking not lessthan 200,000 refugees to assist the French. Such a large additionto our alien population would, however, raise serious problems forour security organisation. In any case, we could not deal with more than 10,000 refugees a day without running grave securityrisks.In discussion, it was strongly urged that recent militarydevelopments had created an entirely new situation. No furtherrefugees should be admitted to this country until the militarysituation became clearer. Assistance, both in money and in food,might be given to the French, but all available shipping must bekept in readiness to deal with urgent calls that might be made on it.It was important too that refugees should be moved away fromthe French Ports where they were causing congestion.
The western front.Position of theB.E.F.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 131stConclusions,Minute 1.)13. At the close of the Meeting, the Secretary of State forWar reported a conversation which he had just had with the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff on the position of the B.E.F.A record of the Secretary of State for War&apos;s statement is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S.W.May 20, 1940.1,The War Cabinet agreed : (a) That no further refugees should be admitted to this countryuntil the military situation had become clearer.(b) That our attitude to the French Government in this matter should be as follows : (i) we did not repudiate our undertaking to take200,000 refugees;(ii) recent military developments had created a new situation, in which it was essential that shipping should be kept ready to meet urgent military needs. This made the admission of furtherrefugees impossible for the present;(iii) we were ready to give financial and material assistance to the French in dealing with therefugee problem within the limits of the totalnumber of refugees, which we had undertaken toreceive (200,000).(c) That, if pressure from the French made it necessary tomodify this attitude, the matter should be referred tothe War Cabinet.(d) That in the meantime the Secretary of State for the home department and other Departments concerned shouldcontinue preparations in this country for the reception of refugees on the scale at present contemplated.
