The Air 1.   The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff said that during the nightSituation. a large number of enemy aircraft, apparently engaged in mine-previous laying, approached the coast at various points from Kinnaird&apos;reference:        Head to Beachy Head.   One aircraft flew over Manston.W.M. (40) 111th        Searchlights and anti-aircraft guns came to action off NorthConclusions,      Foreland and Dover, but fog prevented the despatch of fighters.Minute 1.) Further enemy aircraft approached in the early hours of theEnemy activity, morning.   One fighter was sent up to investigate, but had crashedon Canvey Island.  The pilot was not injured.E.A.F. activity. A photographic reconnaissance towards the Friesian IslandsReports of and the German coast had disclosed one large ship and one smallenemy shipping, g^ip near Borkum, and six ships near Norderney.   Cloud prevented the reconnaissance from penetrating further East.A Hudson, on reconnaissance in the Heligoland Bight, hadsighted a large merchant vessel West of Borkum, steering West.The Hudson was engaged by three Messerschmitts 109, one of whichwas shot down.   The rear gunner of the Hudson was killed, andtwo others of the crew were wounded.Mine-laying Ten Hampdens carried out mine-laying operations during theoperations.        night, of which five successfully reached- their objectives at Oslo.Kiel, and the Belts.   All the aircraft returned safely.   These par-ticular mine-laying operations had now been almost completed.Escort of the One Sunderland, five Hudsons, and six Blenheim Fighters hadconvoy from been sent early that morning to provide escort against air attackNamsos. for the force evacuated from Namsos, which should then be about200 miles North of the Shetlands.   They would be followed by otherpatrols.There were no engagements in France, but French dayreconnaissances reported great railway activity in the areaFreiburg-Basle.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval 2.

This would materially strengthenMediterranean:   that squadron vis-a-vis the Italian reconstructed capital ships.H.M.S.Warspite.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 107thConclusions,Minute 5.)Coastal traffic. Traffic was moving up and down the coast in spite of enemymine-laying, since the war channels were being kept open. Sixmagnetic mines had been exploded, one of which was known to havebeen dropped as long ago as the 16th September.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 111thConclusions,Minute 3.)The air attackon the Namsosconvoy: loss ofthe Frenchdestroyer Bisonand of H.M.S.afridi.3.   The War Cabinet were given the following information : (1) The convoy with the troops evacuated from Namsos hadbeen continuously and skilfully attacked by about 50 aircraft fromthe time in the early morning of the day before when it reachedthe open sea, and throughout the day the enemy had. shown con-siderable efficiency in shadowing the ships. H.M.S. Carlisle, whichhad been heavily engaged during the previous day at Namsos, hadrun out of ammunition and the Commander-in-Chief had sentH.M.S. Southampton and three destroyers to reinforce the convoy,but they had not been able to reach them during the day.The French destroyer Bison had been hit by a bomb, hermagazines had blown up and she had sunk. Forty survivors had[21255] b 2
Evacuation ofAndalsnes: air attacks onH.M.S. Calcuttaon 1st May.Britishcasualties in norway.Narvik.Air reinforce-ment of the narvik area.The coast southof Narvik.been picked up. Later H.M.S. A fridi was struck by a bomb, and sank in fifty minutes. It was not known how many survivors hadbeen rescued. The convoy had steered all day North-West beforeturning at dusk on to its course for Scapa. No air protection hadbeen possible, since it was out of range of fighter aircraft fromthis country, but, as reported by the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff,there would be protection throughout to-day.(2) Details of the air attacks on H.M.S. Calcutta off Andalsneson the 1st May had now been received. Forty attacks had beenmade, and 156 bombs dropped. There had been no hits, and no casualties. Two enemy aircraft were shot down, and seen to crash.Two more were shot down, and two or three so damaged that their return must be very doubtful.H.M.S. Glasgow, with evacuated troops and 23 tons of goldbullion on board, was on passage to the Clyde.(3) General Paget had reported that there had been about 1,800casualties in the forces evacuated from Andalsnes, but this was thought to include all the casualties which had previously been evacuated, and the 800 walking wounded embarked on the firstnight of evacuation. There might have been some troop casulties on H.M.S. A fridi, but taking all things into consideration, theevacuation of Andalsnes and Namsos had been achieved withremarkably little loss.Later in the meeting the Secretary of State for War statedthat no firm estimate of the casualties sustained by the Allied forces was yet available. He had received some provisional figures showingthe numbers originally disembarked, as compared with the numbersevacuated, from which it was gathered that General Pagefscasualties amounted to about 1,800 including sick and slightlywounded. It would be remembered that General Morgan&apos;s Brigadehad at one time been reported as reduced in fighting strength to400 men, but stragglers had apparently come in as it seemed that700 men of his Brigade had been re-embarked.(4) The First Lord said that, as announced in the War Officecommunique the previous night, our troops were gradually closingin on Narvik, and there had been some fighting. It was very desirable that matters should be brought to a definite conclusion inthat region, and Lord Cork intended to seek a decision in thecoming week. The First Lord thought that he was wise to do so,and that his proposed action should be supported whatever the outcome.Intensive enemy air attack was now likely in the Narvik area,and although work on the anti-aircraft defences was being pressed on relentlessly, there would be no fighter aircraft operating on land in the Narvik area for a week or ten days. A certain numberof anti-aircraft guns were available on the spot and more were onthe way, and the troops were well dispersed so that the damage from air attack should not be great.(5) The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said that, according to arrangements made by the Air Ministry and the Admiralty, two aircrafts carriers would sail on the 8th and the 9th May, with one squadron of Hurricanes, and one squadron of Gladiators. Theyshould arrive on or before the 12th May by which time the aerodromes would be defended by guns, and would be provided withstores. Meanwhile, the Ark Royal was sailing to-day to provideair support. The reports showed that the Bardo aerodrome wassuitable for Gladiators, and might be suitable for Hurricanes.(6) Bodo had been occupied by a Company from the forces inthe Narvik area and Mosjoen by 100 Chasseurs Alpins. IndependentCompanies from this country had left or were leaving to relievethese forces and also to occupy Mo and other points on the coast.
The War Cabinet Took note of this information.(i)(ii)Approved the proposal of the First Lord of the Admiraltythat Lord Cork should be assured that, whatever the outcome, he would have the full support of the WarCabinet in any action he might think fit to take to bringmatters to a conclusion in the Narvik area.Operations in norway.Effect on theNavy of german air superiority in Norway.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 109thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he felt some uneasiness about one of the arguments which had been mentioned in the War Cabinet as justifying our withdrawal from central Norway. The argument which he had in mind wassummarised in the Confidential Annex in the following way : &quot; The maintenance of such a force through ports over which the enemy had great air superiority would have imposed a strain on the Navy, and thereby impaired its mobility to an extent which would only have been justified if great results could have been obtained.&quot;This seemed to be an argument which ought to be used with thegreatest caution. If it were injudiciously employed in public, theeffect on public opinion, both here and abroad, which at presentattributed our withdrawal from Central Norway to Germany&apos;s air superiority on the spot, might be to create the impression that theRoyal Navy was no longer the powerful instrument of war whichthey had always believed it to be.Careful handling of this point would also be required in the debates which were to take place in the House of Commons on tuesday, the 7th. May, and in the House of Lords on Wednesday, the8th May.In discussion, the view was put forward that the new factorwith which we had had to reckon in Central Norway was not somuch the effect on the Navy of enemy air superiority as its effecton military bases and military movements in the field.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he could not agreewith the above view, and that it was for this very reason that theAdmiralty had asked that the wording originally used in the confidential Annex under discussion might be amended in the sensequoted by the Foreign Secretary. The development of the airweapon had undoubtedly affected the mobility of the Fleet, whichit was essential to retain.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that great caution would have to be exercised inany public references to the effect on the Navy of the air superiority which the enemy had enjoyed in CentralNorway, and that the emphasis should be laid on the almost insuperable difficulty of conducting land opera-tions in a country where the enemy had superiority inthe air.(2) Took note that the passages dealing with this matter inthe speech to be made by the Prime Minister in theHouse of Commons on Tuesday, the 7th May, 1940,would be agreed with the First Lord of the Admiralty,and that drafts of the speech would be supplied as soonas practicable to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the First Lord and the Minister without portfolio.[21255]b 3
publicity, &amp;c,arrangements.Operations in 5.   Some discussion took place as to the arrangements for theNorway. return of the troops from Norway to this country, and as to theReturn of troops publicity which was likely to result.to this country: pjie pjrst Lord 0f the Admiralty said that, whatever criticismmight be directed against the Government for the strategy andconduct of the operations, no blame could be attached to the troops,and the Press ought to take the line that they should be regardedas heroes, and should give them a fine and encouraging reception ontheir return. The Press might also be reminded that we mustlearn courageously to endure reverses and not to react to them insuch a way as to give the enemy encouragement at a critical stage of the struggle. It was difficult, in any case, to have to debate theconduct of the campaign in the House of Commons, but it wouldbe almost impossible for the Government adequately to state their case without giving the enemy information as to the reasons for ouractions, &amp;c. It would be intolerable that the House of Commons orthe Press should make the task of the Government more difficult by insisting on revelations of a kind which would assist the enemy and by making defamatory statements which were eagerly utilisedby the enemy. If the position were properly explained to the Press,he was sure that the Press would respond well, and would realise that thejr had their part to play in helping us to achieve victory.He suggested that the returning troops should not be allowedto come into contact with troops about to embark for further operations, e.g., it would be a pity if the French, returning fromNamsos were to mix with the French Division now waiting in the clyde.The Lord Privy Seal also gave it as his opinion that the Presswould be ready to help if they were given the right lead.The Secretary of State for War said that, while it was notpossible to prevent the returning troops coming into contact withthe public and the Press, he would discuss with the Lord Priv)&apos; Sealhow best to avoid publicity of an undesirable kind. It had been planned that part of the returning troops should be landed in the clyde, and he would consider whether it was possible to divert themto-other destinations where it would be easier to make satisfactory arrangements.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs urged that, if anytroops were to arrive in the Clyde, a direct approach should be madeto enlist the good offices of the Lord Provost of Glasgow.The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for War to consider whetherit would be practicable to disembark as many as possible of the troops now returning from Norway at ports otherthan those ports like the Clyde, where fresh troops about to leave for Norway were located.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theSecretary of State for War, to take steps to securepublicity of a satisfactory kind in connection with thereturn of our troops from the Norwegian operations.(3) Eequested the Secretary of State for Home Affairs toconsider how best the Lord Provost of Glasgow mightbe approached, so that his good offices might be enlistedin connection with the disembarkation in the Clyde ofany troops returning from Norway.
9 0Norway and sweden.Attitude ofPresidentHambro.Attitude of theSwedishGovernment.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 111thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams : Stockholm telegram No. 456 DIPP. reporting PresidentHambro as having said that there would be great bitternessin Norway over the manner of our leaving Namsos. TheNorwegian Colonel commanding about 6,000 troops there (whowere since said to have surrendered) had, it was alleged, beengiven no warning of our intentions, and had not been left evena single cartridge to defend himself with. The norwegian government were secretly at Tromso, but President Hambrohad heard rumours that His Majesty&apos;s Government had advisedthem to make the best terms possible with the Germans. he wished to know what was the truth.1,000 Norwegian troops, who had been putting up a stoutfight south of Roros, had been ordered by President Hambro to cross the Swedish Frontier in plain clothes and to find their waynorth.   They could not go on fighting for lack of ammunition.Stockholm telegram No. 459, dated the 3rd May, reportedthat President Hambro had that day held a meeting in stockholm of the Norwegian Parliament, including four members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. They had decidedunanimously to telegraph to the Norwegian Government recom-mending that the struggle be continued, but only provided thatthe Allies did not intend to abandon Narvik and North Norway..Could President Hambro be given an assurance to that effect?Stockholm telegram No. 457, dated the 3rd May, reportedM. Boheman as having said that Sweden&apos;s situation was nowdesperate. She was completely cut off and could only tradewith Germany and Russia. No hope seemed to exist that weshould open up Trondhjem and he doubted whether we could hold Narvik against air attacks.In discussion, the view was expressed that these telegrams con-stituted yet another revelation of Scandinavian futility andweakness. It seemed likely that Sweden, having failed to come tothe assistance first of Finland and then of Norway, might be con-contemplating purchasing immunity from German aggression byexporting to Germany even larger quantities of iron-ore. Any such development would be intolerable.The Secretary of State for War said that he had no con-firmation of the report of the surrender at Namsos of 6,000Norwegian troops.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to convey to the Norwegian Government the assurance requested by President Hambro, namely, that the Allies did not intend to abandon Narvik and North Norway.TheNetherlands.Preparations tomeet possibleGermanaggression.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 111thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto The Hague telegram No. 132 DIPP, dated the 3rd May, inwhich Sir Nevile Bland referred to his earlier telegram No. 118DIPP. As regards defensive preparations in Friesland, the DutchMinister for Foreign Affairs had certainly not intended to exclude the possibility of asking for British help. As regards Limburg, ithad just been reported to a member of the staff of His Majesty&apos;sLegation by the sister (well known to them) of a Dutch officer thatgreat progress had recently been made with the local defences,&quot; since last Thursday with the assistance of the Belgians.&quot; If that were true, it probably meant that it was intended to put up 100 percent, resistance in Limburg, which Avould inevitably bring in the
whole of Holland. In such a case, it would be unthinkable thatthe Dutch should not welcome, if not seek, our assistance.Sir Nevil Bland added that he intended to take an early-opportunity of seeing the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, whenhe would endeavour to clarify the position.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) tilthConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams : Rome telegram No. 454 DIPP, dated the 3rd May,reporting the Secretary of the United States Embassy in Romeas having said, in the strictest confidence, that his embassy had most reliable information from a certain source aboutSignor Mussolini&apos;s present policy, which was to come into thewar as soon as he was convinced that Germany was about towin it. Signor Mussolini, however, was said to realise that italy could not last for more than from four to six months.Vatican City telegram No. 52 DIPP, dated the 3rd May,reporting Mr. Myron Taylor&apos;s impressions of signor mussolini&apos;s oral reply to President Roosevelt&apos;s message,delivered through the United States Ambassador in Rome.The most important point was that the reply opened the wayto further communication from the President, if he desired tomake one. Apparently, Signor Mussolini had dealt with thewhole war from the broadest point of view, attributing theresponsibility for it, as well as for the Norwegian campaign, tothe Allied Governments. The implication would seem to bethat, not only Signor Mussolini himself, but also Hitler, couldbe bought off at a price. Mr. Osborne, however, could not vouchfor this inference.As regards Italian policy, and Italian demands oraspirations in the Mediterranean, it appeared that the latter were more moderate than might have been expected from recentItalian utterances. The question of Gibraltar played a large part; satisfaction was demanded in regard to Italian liberty of passage at both Gibraltar and Suez, and it was understoodthat some form of internationalization was suggested. It was mr. Taylor&apos;s belief that financial facilities might play a partin any settlement with Italy.Mr. Osborne reported that no information was available as tothe nature or reception of the Pope&apos;s communication to signor mussolini.   The communication had been duly made.Addis Ababa telegram No. 40, dated the 2nd May,reporting that the Viceroy of Abyssinia, who had only just returned from Rome, was preparing to leave again for Italyat once, in order to attend the opening of the Naples OverseasExhibition on the 9th May.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Roumania.Incident onM. SurhVsjourney throughBucharest.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Bucharest telegram No. 46, dated the 27th April, describing anincident which had taken place at the Bucharest Railway stationwhile M. Suritz&apos;s train had been in the station. The police hadbeen at some pains to keep at a distance from M. Suritz&apos;s compart-ment a group of persons who, in the eyes of the police, looked rather
Germany. 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionAlleged shooting to Stockholm telegram No. 44, dated the 30th April, reportingof Herr President Hambro as having stated that Herr Heidrich had beenHimmler sent to Stockholm by the Gestapo because Herr Himmler, who hadbeen intended for this mission, had been shot through both cheeksand had not yet sufficiently recovered.Mr. Mallet added that he had heard this story from anothersource, but could not vouch for its authenticity.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Supply of 11.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he might wishMilitary to raise at an early date the possibility of purchasing some riflesEquipment. of Belgian manufacture, some of which were now in Belgium and proposed pur- the rest in Germany, and also some Oerlikon guns and anti-tankchase of supplies rifles at present in Estonia. The Ministry of Supply were making of German enquiries into the quality of these supplies, and, if the result of origin. these enquiries was satisfactory, he would wish to urge most strongly that&quot;&quot; the transaction should not be ruled out because itmight result in an addition to Germany&apos;s foreign exchange resources. The Estonians were said to have made satisfactory arrangements for the transit of the supplies in question throughRussian territory, nominally en route for China.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 4, 1940.suspicious. It had eventually been established that they were members of the Soviet Legation in Bucharest, and the necessaryapologies were tendered.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
