The western front and air operations.Progress of theoperations onthe western front.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 131stConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, who had just returned from Flanders, would give theWar Cabinet his appreciation of the present state of affairs on theWestern Front. General Ironside had had a narrow escape the previous night when his hotel at Calais had received a direct hitfrom a German bomb.The Prime Minister said that the situation was more favourable than certain of the more obvious symptoms would indicate. Themost dangerous of these symptoms was that a German armouredcolumn, which had been reported in strength at Amiens, had nowentered Abbeville, and held that town. Another armoured columnhad been seen passing Frevent. It was probably making forBoulogne. Two battalions of Guards were being sent to Boulognein destroyers in order to hold that town against the German column.Our forces still enjoyed an overwhelming superiority of numbers in this theatre of operations. We must now be ready tofight hard under open warfare conditions.The Germans had probably left very small forces, if any, behindto hold the towns through which they had passed. Cambrai was believed to be practically empty of Germans. We had held Arras,although German armoured fighting vehicles were reported on allthe roads round the town. Two British divisions were now operating in this theatre to the south and west of Arras; it was hoped that a third division would join them that day.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff had found GeneralBillotte, who was in command of the French left, in a state ofindecision, but had galvanised him into giving orders for a counter-attack southwards from the Douai-Valenciennes area, in which hehad some eight French divisions at his disposal. There seemed noreason why the counter-attack should not result in retakingCambrai. General Weygand was visiting Flanders that day andwould see both Lord Gort and General Billotte.The Secretary of State for War read an exchange of telegramswith Lord Gort.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in the course of a.statement reporting the results of his visit to Flanders, brought outthe following points : (i) Indecision had reigned in the French High Command inthe north until the arrival of General Weygand and himself. General Billotte was expressing the gloomiestforebodings, but was doing nothing. He had failed tocarry out his duties of co-ordination for the last eight days, and appeared to have no plans. He (general ironside) had complained on the telephone to general weygand, who had spoken sharply to General Billotte.(ii) He believed that there was nothing wrong with the french troops themselves in Flanders. The British Expedi-tionary Force were in very good heart, and ready for the fight. They had seen practically no fighting so far andtheir total casualties in the field were only of the orderof 500. On one occasion our men had dealt veryeffectively with a low-flying attack by German aircraft;they had brought down nine of the enemy with theirBren guns, and the low-flying attack had thereuponceased.On the whole, our own High Command werestanding up well to the situation, although one or twochanges had been made among the corps and divisionalcommanders.(iii) One of our principal difficulties was the state of our linesof communication. These were crossed by French linesof communication.   In any event, all the roads on both[21320] &apos; b 2
lines were filled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Belgium and the northern French towns.The crowds on the roads included some stragglers fromthe Dutch Army. The worst feature was the confusionin the towns through which these roads passed,(iv) The first thing to be done, in order to get a grip on thesituation south and west of Arras, was to clear the towns of refugees, to block entrances to the towns andto hold them with our troops. Once we had occupied inthis way such nodal points as Doullens, Frevent, St. Pol,Albert and Bapaume, we should have gone a long way towards settling the problem of the German armouredcolumns which had taken us in the rear. Some of the towns he had mentioned were not, strictly speaking, inthe B.E.F. sector, but this was no time for standing onceremony.(v) The next step would be to deal with the German armouredcolumns themselves. Very quick action would benecessary; otherwise the Germans would receive con-siderable reinforcements by parachute and by troop-carrying aircraft. A British force, consisting of botharmoured fighting vehicles and infantry would have tobe collected at once. The Armoured Division, whichwas on the way to the scene of operations, might formthe nucleus of such a force. General Evans, itsCommander, had landed at Havre with his staff, but thefirst units of the Division had had to be diverted toCherbourg, owing to the recent air attack on Havre.(vi) The German armoured columns probably consisted of medium tanks and motorised infantry. One of them had been observed passing a given point in about25 minutes, and was estimated to comprise some 5,000or 6,000 troops.(vii) There were a certain number of troops in towns on the. .   lines   of   communication,   such   as   Abbeville,   butconsiderable forces were needed to hold up armouredcolumns. Nevertheless, anti-tank guns were being sent out of the line to these forces in order that they mightestablish blocks at the main road junctions,(viii) In the confused fighting that would be going on it wasvery probable that General Georges would not haveup-to-date information of the enemy&apos;s movements. Thenormal liaison channels through Headquarters, british air Forces in France might not suffice to call up air support quickly against profitable targets for bombingby our air forces in the Amiens-Arras area.The Prime Minister expressed the gratitude of the WarCabinet to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff for dealing sopromptly and vigorously with the situation in France. Hesuggested that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and theChief of the Air Staff should concert together arrangements for ensuring that prompt and adequate air support could be provided tothe operations of our forces in the Amiens-Arras area.Air operations The Chief of the Air Staff reported that a force of Blenheimsover France and had carried out attacks on columns of armoured vehicles in theBelgium. area Arras-Cambrai on the morning of the 20th May.   Villagespacked with troops had been bombed and several bursts had been observed on columns of troops on the roads.In the afternoon 23 aircraft, heavily escorted by fighters, had attacked enemy columns in the area Arras-Bapaume. OneHurricane had been lost, but one enemy aircraft had been shot down,and possibly another as well. Various successful attacks had beenmade against transport and troops.
91 bombers had been operating last night. Enemy concentra-tions in the Cambrai-Le Cateau-Hirson-Vervins-St. Quentin area had been attacked. The following places had been reported as full of troops : Valenciennes, Foret de Mormal, Vis, Foret de Nouvion.No movement had been seen west and north of Aubigny. A petrolconvoy seemed to have been hit near Nouvion, since high flames andmany explosions had been seen.  A train had been hit near Hirson.18 Blenheims had attacked columns in the area Audenarde-Grammont-Hal. One column a mile and a half long had been attacked.No reports had been received from the Air Component or the advanced Air Striking Force owing to the interruptions of communications with France.Early on the morning of the 21st, an enemy column on theAmiens-Abbeville road had been attacked.   A squadron of fighterswas operating from Kent over the Lens area.Air attacks on A Hudson had bombed an enemy patrol vessel 100 miles westenemy ships. of the Horns Reef and obtained a direct hit, leaving the ship ina sinking condition. A force of 8 enemy motor torpedo boats46 miles north of the Hook had also been attacked. A laterreconnaissance had reported only 7 boats visible, and it seemed likely that one had been sunk by our aircraft. More aircraft had gone to try and make a further attack on this force. One of our aircraft was missing.Six aircraft had carried out mine-laying operations.The oil tanks at Rotterdam, which had been left undestroyedand were believed to contain 11,000 tons of aviation spirit, hadbeen successfully attacked during the night. Large fires and explosions were seen.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Invited the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and theChief of the Air Staff to ensure that adequate arrange-ments were made for quickly answering calls for air support in the area of the British Expeditionary Force.2.   The First Sea Lord reported that the cables between theEast Coast and Borkum and Norderney had all been cut.The blockships for the Belgian ports were at 30 minutes&apos; notice.The Swedish ship Erik Frisell (5,066 tons) had been sunk byW M (40) 131st gunfire by a U-boat 35 miles south-west of St. Kilda on the morningConclusions,        of tne 19til May.Minute 1) &apos; French destroyer and two oilers had been sunk off Dunkerquein the raid during the previous night. There had been several air attacks on shipping in the Downs and the Channel, but little damagehad resulted.Details were given of the air raid on Havre the previous night and of the damage caused.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference erence:Norway.Operations at narvik.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 131stConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Chief of Naval Staff said that a petrol carrier at narvik had been bombed and destroyed by fire.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to thepolitical aspects of a failure to take Narvik. Telegrams had beensent to His Majesty&apos;s representatives in Norway and Sweden to theeffect that there was no need for them to discuss any further the

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the netherland Foreign Minister had called on him that morning andhad asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would approve theestablishment of the Netherland Government in London, where theyhad obtained suitable office accommodation. The Foreign secretary had expressed his agreement with this proposal, subject to theapproval of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to confirm the provisional approval which he had given to the Netherland Govern-ment to establish themselves in London.Italy.Possible attackon Yugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 231 DIPP, dated the 20th May,&apos; from His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Paris, reporting that the French government considered inopportune the declaration which we had suggested should be made in the event of an Italian attack on Yugoslavia. it did not seem possible to pursue the matter further at the presentmoment otherwise than by asking the Turkish Government for theirviews.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Italy.possible intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 131stConclusions,Minutes and 7.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that sir Percy Loraine was to see Count Ciano that day, but that he hadno further information as to the intentions of the Italian Govern-ment. We had, however, now heard that the Italians were anxiousto proceed with the proposed discussions on contraband policy.The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that he hadbeen proposing to make a statement that afternoon in the House ofCommons on our policy in regard to Italy. In the light of thesituation as it had developed, and in particular the Duce&apos;s reply tohis personal message, he much doubted whether a statement on thelines proposed would serve any useful purpose, while it might wellinvolve us in an unprofitable exchange.There was general agreement with this view.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that there was some reason to believe that the Italian Ambassador in Paris hadbeen told that such a statement was to be made. He thought,however, that we should have no difficulty in answering any question as to why we had changed our-minds on the matter.
U.S.S.R. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said, with theSu^ested des-   Minister for Economic Warfare, he had now seen Sir Staffordpatch of a        Cripps, and that the latter had agreed to undertake the suggestedspecial Envoy to Mission to Moscow on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Moscow. He had also seen M.

The Chief of Naval Staff referred to the report that anPossible plan for Italian aircraft carrier of 5,000 tons was shortly leaving Tobruk,blocking the would pass through the Suez Canal on the 25th May and wouldSuez Canal. reach Massawa on the 27th May. It was not at all clear what(Previous purpose this movement would serve, and it was necessary toEef erence: consider the possibility that the aircraft carrier would be a veryW.M.

Also, thatarrangements should be made to enable the Canal to be temporarilyblocked at short notice if we wanted to play for time in regard tothe passage of this aircraft-carrier.The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Chief of Naval Staff to endeavour to obtain further details, through the Naval Attache in Rome, inregard to the movements of this vessel,(ii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to instruct the senior Naval Officer in the Canal Zone to get into touchwith the local officials of the Suez Canal Company, witha view to arranging for a temporary blockage of the canal, if it should be required,(iii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toexplain the position to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atRome, and to ascertain if he favoured a direct approach to the Italian Government on this matter.
Netherland east indies.Japanese policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 127thConclusions,Minute 6.)10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 795 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo,reporting as follows : A member of the Embassy Staff had been told in Japaneseofficial quarters that the question of the Netherland east indies could now be regarded as settled, and that, unless someother Power intervened, the Japanese fleet would not movesouth.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Demolitions inNorthern French ports and in belgium.Calais andBoulogne.Ghent andBruges.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 118thConclusions,Minute 4.)11. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said thatduring the last few days plans had been worked Out and prepara-tions made for carrying out demolitions in Northern French ports.In view of the menacing situation with regard to Calais andBoulogne, Naval demolition parties had been organised and wouldbe ready to sail during the course of the afternoon.The Prime Minister thought that there was no immediate riskof the Germans occupying the French ports in strength.The Secretary of State for War said that two battalions werebeing sent to Boulogne to deal with any German advanced forces which might manage to reach the port.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he had no information as to whether demolitions at Ghent and Bruges hadbeen or would be carried out. These demolitions had been a responsibility of the French authorities, but the French troops hadbeen withdrawn from northern Belgium.The Prime Minister suggested that the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster should get into touch with Admiral Keyes and invitehim to do everything possible to ensure that the demolitions were affected.The War Cabinet agreed :  (1) That the demolition parties should proceed to Calais andBoulogne forthwith.(2) That the officer in command of the parties should have authority to destroy any stores of petrol in these twoports, if this course was necessary to deny them to theGermans.(3) That save as in (2), no demolitions should be effectedwithout instructions from the Admiralty.Invasion ofGreat Britain.Possibility ofseaborne andairborne attack.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 116thConclusions,Minute 1.)12. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff Committee,^in collaboration with the Ministry of home security, on Seaborne and Airborne attack on the UnitedKingdom (W.P. (40) 153).The Prime Minister suggested that the War Cabinet should give the Report their general approval. He did not feel, however,that every aspect of the problem had been covered and he thoughtthat further consideration should be given to the matter in thefollowing week in the light of an appreciation which was being prepared by officers of the three Services of the possibilities of attack looked at from the enemy&apos;s point of view.
11 d  (previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 127thConclusions,Minute 16.)(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) Con-clusions 119 A,Minute 4.)Supply of fire-arms.In discussion, the following points were raised : Fortifications.(1) The Lord Privy Seal referred to the absence of fortificationsinside this country.   It might be desirable to establishstrong points at a number of places to form centres of resistance against troops landed from the air, until. mobile troops could be concentrated to destroy them.The Secretary of State for War undertook to follow up this suggestion.Arming of Police.(2) In reply to a question, the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs and Minister of Home Security said that theCommissioner of Metropolitan Police, after full discussion with his Chief Superintendents, was opposedto the arming of the Police. Only a small proportion ofthe Police had been trained in the use of fire-arms, andin the Commissioner^ view, provided that there wasno shortage of personnel who could be armed, the police should be kept for civil police work, of which there wouldbe plenty, while the available arms were issued to other-personnel.(3) The Prime Minister was reluctant to accept the view thatthe police should not be armed. In many instances,foreign police forces carried arms; and he thought thatthe matter should be further examined before any finaldecision was reached.Supply of fire-arms.(4) The Secretary of State for War said that, at the moment,there were not sufficient rifles and pistols to arm all themen who had volunteered. It was suggested that thequestion of obtaining further supplies of pistols andshotguns, by withdrawal from private persons, shouldbe considered.Supreme authority in event of invasion.(5) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked whetherit was quite clear that, in the event of seaborne or air-borne invasion, supreme authority devolved on themilitary authorities.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs and minister of Home Security said that Regional Com-missioners were in the closest touch with the Militaryauthorities and it was quite clear that, in the event of invasion, the Military authorities took command.Defence of aerodromes and aircraft factories.(6) The Ijord President of the Council thought that first priority should be given to the defence of aerodromes and aircraft factories, more especially the two vitalfactories producing engines for our fighters.The War Cabinet-(i) Gave general approval to the report of the Chiefs of Staff(W.P. (40) 153), and in particular gave coveringapproval to the setting up of a Home Defence Executive,(ii) Took note that the problem of Defence against seaborneand airborne attack was being made the subject offurther intensive study, and that &quot;it would again bebrought before Ministers in about a week&apos;s time.[21320] &apos; c
Aircraft 13.   The Lord Privy Seal reported to the War Cabinet that production. agreement had been reached on two out of the three points which(Previous were remitted to him for arbitration at the meeting held on reference: Saturday, the 18th May. On the third point, relating to the supplyW.M. (40) 127th of aircraft to Canada, the War Cabinet had before them MemorandaConclusions by the Minister for Aircraft Production and by the Secretary of minute 14.)&apos;      State for Air (W.P. (40) 160 and 161).The proposal was to withhold the despatch to Canada of Ansonand Battle aircraft to be used for the training of pilots, observersand air gunners. It was a question of weighing the advantage ofan immediate addition to our air strength in medium bombers,against the prospective provision of pilots as a long-term policy.There was no evidence that other aircraft were available to take theplace of the machines proposed to be withheld. The attitude of theDominion Governments was likely to be unfavourable to a cessation,and it was important to maintain a continuous supply of trainedflying personnel. In these circumstances, he had reached the con-clusion that the comparatively small addition to our air strengthrepresented by the aircraft being despatched to Canada was insufficient to justify at present the withholding of the delivery ofthese machines.The following were the main points made in the discussion :  (1) The Minister for Aircraft Production stated that he had that morning received an undertaking from Messrs. BryanAllen that they could produce 100 Lycoming engines amonth which were suitable for fitting to Battles andAnson aircraft. He suggested, therefore, that the Rolls-Merlin and Cheetah engines now fitted to these airframesshould be taken out and fitted into airframes now in reserve, but for which no engines were immediately available.The Secretary of State for Air suggested that thiswas a new proposal which he would gladly discuss withthe Minister.(2) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointed outthat the Air Training Scheme had been agreed with theDominion Governments of Australia, New Zealand and canada. Elementary training was carried out inAustralia and New Zealand, and more advanced trainingin Canada. If there was to be any gap in the supplyof aircraft for training, we might have to ask theDominion Governments to accept a modification of the agreed scheme.(iii) Asked that certain aspects of the problem should befurther examined as below : (a) The Secretary of State for War was asked to investi-gate what arrangements were being made for theestablishment of strong points in the areas whereairborne invasion was most likely to be attempted.(ft) The Secretary of State for Home Affairs and theMinister of Home Security was asked to consider further, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for War, whether the police should be armed.(c) The Secretary of State for Home Affairs was askedto investigate the possibility of supplementing the stocks of small arms available to the authorities by collecting shotguns and pistols from private persons.
The Netherlands 14. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heand Belgium. had received an urgent message from M. Corbin in regard to theEeeeption of assistance which we had undertaken to give the French in dealingwar refugees. with the refugee problem. The French Government were anxious(Previous that we should designate one person with whom they could establishReference: contact and who would be responsible for co-ordinating the dutiesW.M. (40) 131st Qf all Departments in this matter. The Foreign Secretary proposedConclusions, that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should undertakeMinute 12.)&apos;      these duties.The War Cabinet agreed to this proposal.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,May 21, 1940.(3) The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that there were already 700 aircraft of the types in question in store,for which equipment would have to be found before theAnsons and Battles, due for despatch to Canada, couldbe readapted for operational use. It was suggested thatthe provision, for the Battles and Ansons due for despatch to Canada, of the items of equipment whichwere in short supply, was likely to interfere with theprovision of equipment for more modern types.(4) The Prime Minister said that Battle aircraft were being used on the front to-day, and that they were likely to be increasingly useful in the course of the next two months,if the enemy were to establish bases closer to the UnitedKingdom, and were to obtain a foothold on the french coast. The types of aircraft now in question were notthose of the first efficiency, but if we ran short of the better types it would be unwise to deprive ourselves ofthe second-best in the life-and-death struggle which we might have to face in the next few weeks. Although, thenumber of machines involved was inconsiderable, hethought that it would be dangerous to send away fromthe country even a small number of aircraft, if they couldbe used for operational purposes in the near future.The supply of pilots, though of immense value, wasremote in comparison with the needs of the moment,when the enemy appeared to be staking everything on reaching a quick decision. He was therefore inclined to suspend the despatch of these aircraft until after theimmediate crisis, and felt confident that the dominions would understand the position.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Air to re-examine theposition in consultation with the Minister of aircraft production, with particular reference, to (a) the proposal that Battle and Anson airframes onlyshould be sent over, and Lycoming engines fitted inCanada;(b) the question whether operational equipment could bemade available for the aircraft in question, withoutinterfering with the supply of equipment to more modern types.The Ministers were invited to inform the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs of the conclusions reached.
