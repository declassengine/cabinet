The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council recording the results of the Ministerof Health&apos;s second visit to Mr. de Valera, and setting out thealternative possibilities (W.P. (40) 223). The Memorandumsuggested that a written communication should be made toW.M. (40) 173rd Mr. de Valera asking him what would be the attitude of his Govern-Conclusions, ment to a specific plan to which we would be willing to do our best to obtain the assent of the Ulster Government. The maininducement included in the plan was the suggestion that certainequipment should be made available, provided that the scheme as a whole was adopted.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals set out in the Lord Presidentof the Council&apos;s Memorandum, and invited the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs to draw up a communica-tion on the lines proposed.(2) Invited the Minister of Health to take the communication to Dublin himself, and there await the reply of the eire government.(3) Agreed that, while the proposed communication did not go beyond asking Mr. de Valera what his attitude wouldbe to the plan suggested, it was liable to be represented as an offer. Accordingly, the Lord President of theCouncil was invited to write to Lord Craigavoninformally, indicating to him in broad outline the natureof the communication being made to Mr. de Valera.France.The french fleet.(previous reference erence:W.M.

The War Cabinet were infoimied that the Richelieu had sailed from Dakar at 2-15 p.m. that afternoon.The conclusion as to the action to be taken by the Admiraltyis recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.3. The War Cabinet were informed that four merchant shipsbelonging to an outgoing convoy had been sunk in the western approaches. In these circumstances, it became necessary to considerwhether the operation to cut out merchant ships from the Gironde(originally planned to take place that night, but which could not181st now fcake place until the ensuing night) should be put into operation,or whether the Destroyers required for the operation should beemployed on convoy duties.The Wrar Cabinet-Decided that the cutting out operation should stand, onthe basis already approved, viz., it should cover the allied and neutral shipping, but not French merchant shippingwithin territorial waters. It would not include thecontre-torpilleur.France.French troopsin the middle east.4. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a telegramfrom General Wavell, despatched at 3-25 that afternoon, containing the following sentence : Consider immediate statement should be made by BritishGovernment to Algiers, Syria and DJibuti, either that newFrench Government is being formed to continue war orauthorising French forces to join British Navy, Army andAir Force.&quot;
The War Cabinet-Agreed that a statement should be drafted on the linesthat we were not at present in a position to say whethera new French Government was being formed, but thatwe should welcome French forces serving with the british navy, Army and Air Force. The terms of this communica-tion should be agreed between the three Service Depart-ments and the Foreign Office, who should be consulted asto the manner in which the proposed statement shouldbe issued.Richmond Terrace.
