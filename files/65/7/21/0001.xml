The western front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 125th-Conclusions.)The PrimeMinister&apos;s visit to Paris.1. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet an account ofhis visit to France on the previous day.He had found M. Daladier and General Gamelin depressed,but M. Reynaud in rather better heart. There was no doubt that the9th French Army had sustained a heavy defeat. Their smalleranti-tank guns were unable to stop the German tanks and theGerman tanks&apos; flame-throwing gun was effective to a range of about300 yards, even against block houses. Some of the French troops,however, had retreated without sufficient cause.The Germans bad some 30 to 40 divisions massed behind the gap.It was now plain why the Allied troops had not been bombed in their advance into Belgium; the Germans had wanted to get us intoforward positions in order to effect a break through and turn ourflanks.The German advance had now slowed down, probably to re-formand re-fuel. French divisions were being brought up from Alsace,and down from the North. General Giraud had been put in command of the 9th Army, the commander of which had beensuperseded.The Prime Minister had also seen General Swayne who had reported that General Georges was dealing calmly with thesituation.The Prime Minister said that he had made it clear to theFrench that, unless they made a supreme effort, we would not feel justified in accepting the grave risk to the safety of this country which would be entailed by the despatch of more fighters to France.If the French would fight their hardest, we would do everything possible to help them.He had also seen Air Vice-Marshal Evill, who had g given amost encouraging account of the air fighting, in which the Germanlosses had been four or five times as great as our own. The total german losses had been so heavy that there was little doubt that the disparity between the Allied and German air strength had now beenappreciably lessened. The Germans, however, escorted theirbombing attacks with such heavy fighter protection that it was difficult for our fighters to get at the German bombers.He felt that the War Cabinet had been faced with the gravestdecision that a British Cabinet had ever had to take. On receivingtheir decision (telegram No. 159) he had at once visited M. Reynaudand General Gamelin. He had first of all shown them&apos; the telegram(No. 206 DIPP), which had been before the War Cabinet at their meeting the previous evening. He had then shown them the&apos; War; &apos; Cabinefs reply which had heartened them to a very considerabledegree.He had told Air Marshal Joubert de la Ferte to remain with air Marshal Barratt, who was very tired and must obtain some rest.Both Air Marshals were at General Georges&apos; headquarters. Hehad told them that they must make supreme efforts to settle &apos;&apos; The... Battle of the Bulge &quot; &quot; la Poche &quot; on which the fate of Europedepended. With the arrangements which had now been made, hethought that we should be able to dominate the air over the Bulge.There was a reasonable hope that, with a four or five days&apos; respitefrom air attack, the French Army would be able to rally andre-establish the position.The situation on the rest of the front seemed fairly satisfactory.A plan had been prepared for the withdrawal of the British Armyin stages, if necessary, but he felt that we ought not to yield an inchof ground without- fighting.He had been told that the French had sustained Very1 heavy losses in fighter aircraft and that only one-quarter of the force with which they had started the campaign remained serviceable.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theFrench had been surprised by the direction and weight of the[21297] b 2
German attack, by the strength of the new German tank, and by thedevastating combination of air attack and armoured vehicles. Therewas no doubt, however, that some of the French troops had notfought well. The French were depressed at the lack of successof their light tanks of which they had lost two-thirds. Their heavytanks had had a great success to start with, but they had lost halfof them. They were now faced with the possibility of attack bynine German armoured divisions against which they could onlymuster three. Moreover, the German armoured divisions werestronger than their French equivalents.Some comfort might be taken, however, from the fact that theflower of the French Army was in the North and not in the part ofthe line where the blow had fallen.The Lord President of the Council said that the War Cabinet,at their Meeting on the previous evening, had been most disturbed at the situation revealed in the Prime Ministers telegram. Theyhad realised that the battle might be decisive for France. Theyhad felt that they must respond to the Prime Ministers courageousleadership and had decided that everything possible must be done to give the French a chance to rally.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The western front (con-tinued).Despatch of fighter aircraft to France.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 125thConclusions.)Projectedbomberoperations.Air operations on night of16th/17th May./british expeditionary force.2. The Chief of the Air Staff said that six of the eight fighterflights, which it had previously been decided to send, had reachedFrance at dusk on the previous day; the other two would arrivethat morning. A number of fresh fighter pilots had also been sent.The arrangements to enable six further squadrons of Hurricanes to operate in France would be on the lines described to the War Cabinetthe previous night. Three of the squadrons were now operating in France. The other three had been held up by fog, but would almost certainly be ready to operate that afternoon.The bomber force would be concentrated on the Bulge that night.The Chief of the Air Staff said that attacks had been madeby heavy bombers during the previous night, the 16th-7th May,on (i) enemy  road  and  rail  communications at  Maastricht,Aachen and Munchen-Gladbach;(ii) the coking plant at Hamborn;(iii) docks and marshalling yards at Dusseldorf;(iv) the railway sidings at Hamburg;(v) the aerodrome at Duisburg.Successful attacks had also been made on the hydrogenation plantsat Gelsenkirchen and at Castrop Rauxel. Only one of the heavy bombers sent out had failed to return.Early that morning 12 Blenheims had taken off at 4-50 a.m.to attack objectives at Gembloux. They had run into 15 Messer-schmitts before reaching the target. One of the Blenheims had been shot down in flames and news of the remainder was up to that moment lacking.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theB.E.F. had withdrawn to the line of the canal running throughBrussels. Their position was satisfactory except on the right flankwhere the German armoured vehicles had penetrated the line. Astrong counter-attack was being made. Our troops were distributed in great depth. The danger spots were the flanks. The Belgian Army on our left flank had not yet been attacked.
Extent of The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the latestGerman information received that morning was that the German advanceadvance. had reached the area Laon-Soissons on the direct road to Paris.The Chief of the Air Staff also reported that he had just heard* from Air Marshal Evill that the situation was very serious. TheGermans had made a considerable advance during the night and had reached the line Laon-Soissons. The necessary withdrawal of theair component was considerably hampered by lack of transport, andAir Marshal Evill had asked for troop-carriers to be provided. Thesituation with regard to the air component in the North was more satisfactory. The position of the Advanced Air Striking Force,however, was precarious. As a result of the rapid German advance,the large number of damaged aircraft, and the partial breakdown of communications, the Advanced Air Striking Force must be con-sidered virttially out of action until it could be re-formed.Information for The Minister of Information suggested that more should bePress and done to inform the general public of the seriousness of the situation,general public,   about which most people were in complete ignorance.The Prime Minister agreed. The French communiques andcommentaries were framed with this in view. The public in thiscountry should likewise be made to realise that the British andFrench Armies were engaged in a most critical battle which was approaching its climax.The Secretary of State for War said that the Vice-Chief of theImperial General Staff was seeing the Military correspondents that afternoon. He thought that General Dill, without taking adespondent view, should give a frank account of the position.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had sent a &apos;&apos; Most Secret and Personal &apos;&apos; telegram to the DominionPremiers on the previous evening, informing them of the seriousness of the situation and the steps which were being taken to meet it.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Information to take the necessary steps to bring home to the general public the seriousness ofthe present situation.AircraftSupplies.Replacement of casulties.Purchase of aircraft from united States.(Previous &apos;Reference:W.M. (40) 124thConclusions,Minute 12.)3. The Prime Minister drew attention to the urgent need forreplacing the heavy losses which the Royal Air Force had sustained,particularly in respect of Fighter aircraft. Could another12 Squadrons of Fighters be raised within the next month ?The Chief of the Air Staff explained that special steps werebeing taken to bring existing Fighter squadrons up to strength, andto form new squadrons. These steps included the salvage of allserviceable material and instruments from crashed and damagedaircraft. Despite this, he considered that it would be impossibleto form as many as 12 new squadrons within a month. He would prefer that the War Cabinet should not, at the moment, take adecision to withdraw the Fighter Squadrons covering Scapa.The Secretary of State for Air agreed that our resources wouldnot allow of 12 new Fighter Squadrons being formed within amonth. Enquiries were being made as to the possibility of accelerating and increasing the supply of aircraft from the UnitedStates of America. He drew attention.to the encouraging referenceswhich had been made on this point by President Roosevelt in his speech on the previous evening. If available, such aircraft might perhaps be brought over in an aircraft-carrier.
The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister for Air Production to attend ameeting of the War Cabinet on the following day toexplain what steps could be taken to effect an immediateacceleration of aircraft production, particularly infighters.(2) Agreed that, if the enquiries now being made resulted in further aircraft being obtained from the U.S.A., theAdmiralty should be consulted as to the possibility ofshipping such aircraft from North America in an aircraft-carrier.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 124thConclusions,Minute 4.)Norway.Progress of operations at narvik.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 124thConclusions,Minute 5.)Bearing situation on western Front.4. The Chief of Naval Staff said that there were two shipsmissing in the South Atlantic, and that mines had been laid off CapeAgulhas. It looked, therefore, as though there was a raider in theSouth Atlantic.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.5. The Prime Minister suggested that consideration shouldbe given to the bearing of the new situation in France on our operations at Narvik. On the one hand, we knew that the germans had a complete Geschwader in Norway, which was a welcomediversion. On the other hand, we should consider whether Narvikwas eating up what we needed for our own defence, particularly indestroyers, anti-aircraft guns and Fighters.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Chiefsof Staff had already reviewed our operations at Narvik in the largersetting mentioned by the Prime Minister. As a result, a telegram had been sent to Lord Cork, informing him that he must deal withthe situation with the forces at his disposal and that he could expect no more, and asking for his views. Meanwhile, the situationin Northern Norway appeared to be satisfactory. A number ofGerman prisoners had been taken, with comparatively few casualties among the British forces, and it seemed likely that Narvik wouldbe captured at any moment.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Invasion ofGreat Britain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 15.)Troops available&apos;in this country.Local defence volunteers.6.The War Cabinet gave consideration to the need for main-taining sufficient troops in this country to deal with the possibilityof air-borne invasion. ;&apos;The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there was noshortage in numbers, but that quality was lacking in certain cases.He had spoken to the Commanders-in-Chief on this point and had given them definite instructions that they must imbue the troopswith the spirit that they must at all costs fight. Among the goodmaterial in this country was the London Division, the 15th brigade and the Canadians. In addition, the Regular Cavalry were being formed into armoured units. The possession of mobile artillerywas a reassuring factor.The Secretary of State for War said that there had been a goodresponse to the appeal for volunteers to deal with parachutists. Ahitch, however, had occurred over the question of their compensation in the event of injury, the Treasury taking the view that they shouldbe regarded as civilians, whereas he (the Secretary of State for War)considered emphatically that they should be treated as soldiers, since they would be in uniform.
Italy. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that on thePossible latest evidence he was inclined to think that Signor Mussolini hadintentions.        very nearly reached the point of bringing Italy into the war.( TPrP VIOLISReference - ^he Chief of Naval Staff and the Chief of the ImperialWM (40) 124th General Staff gave a short account of the action which it was conclusions       proposed that our forces should take in that event.Minute 7.)Crete. The Lord President of the Council said that the Meeting over(Previous which he had presided on the previous evening had agreed uponReference: instructions which should be sent to the three Commanders-in-ChiefW.M. (40) 124th in the Mediterranean, giving them an appreciation of the positionConclusions, and authorising them to consult with General Weygand and the minute 11.) senior French Naval Officer in the Mediterranean, in regard to theposition of Crete, and to concert preparatory measures with them.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Minute 7.)ItaIV- 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePossible attack Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 157), suggestingon Yugoslavia. a iine 0f action intermediate between a declaration of war and a(Previous completely negative attitude, which we might take if Italy were to reference:        attack Yugoslavia and it were decided on military grounds to tryW.M. (40) 124th to avoid being involved in war with Italy.Conclusions,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegramNo. 218 DIPP, dated the 16th May, 1940, from the British Ministerat Belgrade to Sir Alexander Cadogan, reporting information whichhe had received from a confidential Yugoslav source. According tothis information, Count Ciano had assured the Yugoslav minister in Rome that Italy had no intention of attacking Yugoslavia, andthat when she did enter the war she would do so &quot; by the frontdoor.&quot; The Yugoslav General Staff were also now of the opinionthat Italian action would not be directed in the near future againstYugoslavia (telegram No. 211, dated the 15th May, 1940, from theBritish Minister at Belgrade). It seemed unlikely therefore, thatthe contingency referred to in his Paper would actually arise; buthe had tried in his Memorandum to suggest a course of action whichwe could take if it did. It was not a very satisfactory proposal,but he was not able to suggest anything that would suit the circum-stances better. It must also be recognised that a statement on theselines would have a profoundly depressing effect on the Balkans.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to consult with the French and Turkish Governments, witha view to securing their agreement to the proposal that, inthe event of an Italian attack on Yugoslavia, the Britishand French Governments should issue a statement on thelines proposed in W.P. (40) 157.United States ofAmerica.Personalniessage to thePrime minister from president roosevelt.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 9.)9. The Prime Minister read to his colleagues a communication which he had received from President Roosevelt in reply to his personal message.The War Cabinet took note of the Statement by the PrimeMinister.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 17, 1940.
