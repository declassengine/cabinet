b v JThe Naval 1.   The Chief of Naval Staff said that the Germans claimedSituation. to have sunk H.M.S. Glorious and one destroyer, also the S.S. Orama(Previous (an empty transport on passage from the Narvik area).  An enemyReference:        battleship, two destroyers and a seaplane had been reported to bew.m. (40) 158th attacking a transport at 9 a.m., the 8th June, but this report had notConclusions,      been received at the Admiralty until the morning of the 9th June.Minute 3.)        (This delay was believed to be due to the fact that the report had come from a hospital ship which was not entitled to use its wirelessto send messages of this description.)   No confirmation of theGerman claim had yet been received, although a corrupt wirelesssignal from Glorious referring to two pocket battleships had beenpicked up at 5-20 p.m. the 8th June.   This message had referredto an earlier message (not received, timed 4-15 p.m.).Extensive air reconnaissances of the whole area were beingcarried out that afternoon, and the Chief of Naval Staff described the operations now on foot to intercept the German units which he believed to be the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisnau, and not the pocket battleships. He also outlined the dispositions in capital ships that had been made to escort the convoys returning from the narvik area, to cover the coasts of Iceland and the British Isles, andto shadow the two ships reported off Iceland on the 5th June.The Prime Minister said that, if the German claim to have sunk the Glorious proved to be justified, it would be a grievous loss,which would involve a heavy loss of life; but it would not materiallyaffect the balance of naval power.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 158thConclusions,Minute 1.)fighter command.Enemy activity.bomber command.2. The Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet thatthere had been considerable air fighting on the previous day, inparticular over the Abbeville area. In these engagements we had lost three fighters and had shot down ten of the enemy.Enemy air activity over this country had been much less on theprevious day. There had been a few minelaying raids, and fiveenemy aircraft had been reported over East Anglia.Our bombing operations over France had been particularlysuccessful. Areas opposite the 51st Division had been attacked, and numerous direct hits had been observed on enemy armoured fighting vehicles and other transport, reports stating that these had, in somecases, caused the utmost confusion. In these operations we had lostfour bombers and had shot down one Messerschmitt 109.One hundred and eight heavy bombers had been sent out duringthe previous night. All of these, with the exception of five, whichhad been employed on minelaying in the Ymuiden area, had been directed against targets chosen by the French. These targets hadincluded ammunition and petrol dumps in two woods south ofAbbeville, where numerous explosions had been observed; railwayjunctions at Hirson, Charleville and Avesnes; and the Northernentrances to Amiens. Thirty-four aircraft had attacked thecrossings over the Somme. Attacks had also been made onmarshalling yards at Reydt and Essen. Numerous fires, suggestingpetrol dumps, had been observed in the Fbret de Chimay. Only oneheavy bomber had been lost, as a result of crashing on return to thiscountry.[21394] b 2
3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that a battlewas in progress along the whole Western Front, from the coastthrough Soissons into the Argonne; and that the French hadparticularly asked that they should be given air support. On thewest of this line the French were falling back, but new Frencharmies were being formed in the Seine area.Air reconnaissance showed that the bridges over the Seine hadbeen blown, including the bridges at Rouen, although there were stilla considerable number of French troops north of the Seine.General Beauman&apos;s force and the British Armoured Divisionwere just south of the Seine at Rouen. The 51st Division was north of the Seine with its left on the coast. A British Officer had beensent over to get in touch with General Fortune and to ascertain thesituation of the 51st Division. He had been instructed to inform general Fortune that, if he had not received orders from the French9th Corps (under whose command General Fortune was), he shouldretire on the axis Rouen-Dieppe. It was important to avoid anyuncertainty in this matter, as a report had been received that theFrench Admiral commanding at Havre was pressing for evacuation from Havre.The Secretary of State for War explained that there had been considerable ambiguity about the origin of the order which was alleged to have been given by the French Admiral at Havre, and that enquiries from General Howard Vyse had shown that the french high Military Command had no knowledge of such an order, and,moreover, that it was General Weygand&apos;s intention that the troopsnorth of the Seine should withdraw southwards and not westwards.Interview with The Prime Minister described a conversation which he had hadGeneral de that afternoon with General de Gaulle, who had recently beenGaulle. appointed to an important position on General Weygand&apos;s Staff.He had given the Prime Minister a more favourable impression ofFrench morale and determination. He had said that with the personnel withdrawn from Dunkirk and arriving from other sourcesThe western front.Progress of operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 158thConclusions,Minute 2.)The Advanced Air Striking Force in France had been engagedin air fights, but details had as yet not been received. Some enemy aircraft had been shot down, but, on balance, it was believed thatwe had lost.A large number of reconnaissance aircraft had been sent out insearch of the Scharnhorst and the Gneisnau; and a squadron of bombers was standing by (see Minute 1).Forty-eight bombers had been despatched to attack enemy concentrations and movements in France. Three of these weremissing.Fog had hampered the activities of Fighter Command, but12 squadrons had been operating. Fighter escorts had been providedfor bombers, and fighters had also been sent to protect transportsover the Cherbourg area.Suspicious There had been a recrudescence of reports of suspicious activi-activities round ties round aerodromes, including alleged signals by lights.   Thereaerodromes.      was a widespread belief that there was real foundation for them.As a result &quot; parashooters &quot; had been ordered out.The Prime Minister alluded to a case which had come to hisnotice of an Air Force Officer having been insulted by troops atDover. He requested the Chief of the Imperial General Staff tocarry out a vigorous campaign, which should include propaganda,in all units to ensure that the gallantry and heroism shown by theRoyal Air Force in recent operations were known and appreciated.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
9   *13 new armoured divisions would be formed, ready to go into action by the 12th June, and thereafter 6 or 7 new divisions would be built up to increase the French reserves. He had urged that the furtherBritish divisions which were being moved to France should be sentas rapidly as possible. The Prime Minister had outlined our plans and had told him that General Weygand would be receiving adefinite programme through the normal liaison channels. He had also explained to General de Gaulle why we could not engage thewhole of our Air Force in the battle in France, and the latter had said that, speaking for himself, he agreed with our policy.The Prime Minister also read to the War Cabinet telegramNo. 373 DIPP, which had just been received from His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Paris, conveying a personal message fromM. Reynaud. This was in a more cheerful tone than some of hisearlier messages; but its main burden was to request the despatchof our divisions as rapidly as possible and to offer to provide themwith artillery and anti-tank guns.The Secretary of State for War, who had also seen general de Gaulle, said that it was important not only to give the Frencha definite programme of the troops that we were planning to send to France, but also that the British and French Ministers of supply should keep in close touch, so as to ensure the fullest co-operation inthe provision of the necessary equipment.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that general de Gaulle had paid a visit to our Armoured Division and had expressed the opinion that our tanks were not heavily enougharmoured. The French &quot;&apos; Char B &quot; had proved itself to be very good, but production would be affected by the loss of the industrial areas which had been overrun.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Invited the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to arrangefor the French High Command to receive a definitestatement and time-table of our plans for sending furtherdivisions to France.Royal marine operation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Prime Minister referred to a photograph which he had seen, which clearly showed that the barrage on the Rhine had been broken by the fluvial mines. The report stated that the river traffichad been completely stopped between Karlsruhe and Mainz.Meanwhile, the French had suggested that we should withdrawAdmiral FitzGerald&apos;s party. In reply, he had drafted a telegram,which he read to the War Cabinet, pointing out the success whichhad attended this manoeuvre and strongly urging that yet further operations of this nature should be undertaken. The Prime Ministerhanded the draft to the Chief of the Air Staff, and requested himto despatch it after making any amendments on points of detail, inconsultation with the Fifth Sea Lord.The War Cabinet took note of this statement, and agreedthat this operation should continue.
Aircraft 5    The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the figuresProduction. showing the large increase in the number of fighter aircraft on the(Previous strength of operational units as compared with the previous week,Reference: and the large numbers of fully equipped aircraft now ready for w.M. (40) 137th service in the Aircraft Storage units.   These figures represented a conclusions, remarkable achievement on the part of the Minister of AircraftMinute 2.) Production, and he thought that the War Cabinet would wish toplace on record their appreciation of it.The War Cabinet-Recorded their appreciation of the success achieved by theMinister of Aircraft Production in increasing the outputof fully equipped aircraft of operational types.Italy. 6.   The Permanent  Under-Secretary of State for ForeignProbable Affairs drew attention to a number of telegrams giving conflictingintentions. reports as to the probable intentions of the Italian Government.(Previous He referred in particular to telegrams No. 872 and No. 880 DIPPReference: from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome, dated the 8th June, theW.M. (40) 157th former suggesting &quot; that everything depended on the issue of theConclusions, battle now raging in France &quot; and the latter conveying a reportMinute 6) &apos; that Signor Mussolini would make his long-deferred speech on the12th or 15th June.He also read out a telegram No. 875 DIPP reporting from anapparently reliable source that, when Italy entered the war,Germany would send 800 to 1,000 aircraft to be manned by Italianpilots; and that the Italians would certainly attack Corsica and malta; that Spain would enter the war if the French were defeatedand that the Italian army was to be at its war stations by the15th June. After the defeat of France, the Italian Navy was toco-operate with the Germans in the invasion of this country.In answer to a question, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff said that he did not think it likely that the Italians would find it practicable to conduct an attack on the Sudan from Libya.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 156thConclusions,Minute 5.)Mowinckelplan.Supply of arms to Norwegians.withdrawal from Narvik:issue ofcommunique.7. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs read a telegram from Stockholm (No. 671 DIPP) reporting that the German Government did not intend to reply to the Swedishplan for the neutralisation of Northern Norway as they hadreceived information that the evacuation of Narvik was beingcarried out.The Secretary of State for War very much regretted that, asthe signal countermanding the order to evacuate all rifles andammunition had not been received in time by Lord Cork, no riflesor small arms ammunition had been left behind for the Norwegians.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked whether it was nowproposed to publish a communique on the evacuation from Narvik.He understood that the War Office did not wish to have anythingmade public until the convoys had reached this country, but had prepared a long statement for eventual publication. He thought the statement, when published, should be short and read to theWar Cabinet a draft that he had prepared.
405 W.M. 159 (40)The War Cabinet agreed that no statement should be issueduntil the returning convoys had reached port, and that, whenpublished, the statement should be on the general lines of thatprepared by the Admiralty.Further discussion in regard to operations in Scandinavia is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Con-clusions.United States of 8. The Prime Minister referred to circular telegram No. 237America. to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions.   Paragraph 4 of this attitude to the   telegram read as follows :-Allies. &quot; United States public opinion towards willingness tohelp Allies, together with counteracting doubts and fears inU.S.A. as regards possibility of involvement in totalitarianwar, has led us to consider launching a judicious campaigndesigned to show that it is neither to our interests nor ourwish that U.S.A. should become involved in totalitarianwarfare. By depriving isolationists of their main argument,it is hoped that Congress would thus be able to move fasterover measures designed to help us.&quot;General Smuts had telegraphed to say that he was seriouslyperturbed at this paragraph. He thought that as events were nowmoving any day anything might happen to precipitate the UnitedStates into the war. Why should we arrest this process of conversion by logic of events?The Prime Minister said that he entirely agreed with the view expressed by General Smuts. A telegram had been sent to correct the impression created by paragraph 4 of the circular telegramreferred to.The Permanent Undersecretary of State for Foreign affairs referred to telegrams Nos. 931 and 932 from our Ambassador atWashington. The latter dealt with the alarm felt in the UnitedStates as to what would happen if the British Navy was destroyed or captured. Public opinion in the United States was coming tosee that it was a primary interest of the United States to keepBritain unconquered and her Fleet and bases intact. Unfortunately,many Americans seemed to believe that, whatever happened to therest of our Empire, the United States would get the British Fleet.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the text of atelegram which he had drafted dealing with the points made inthese telegrams.The War Cabinet-Took note of the above statements and agreed to thedespatch to our Ambassador at Washington of a telegram on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 9, 1940.
