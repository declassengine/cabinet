The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 156thConclusions,Minute 1.)Is The Chief of the Air Staff said that 168 enemy aircraft hadbeen plotted over the United Kingdom and along our coasts between10 p.m. and 3 a.m. on the previous night. A considerable numberof bombs had been dropped, but the damage had been negligible and casualties very few. Police and Observer Corps reports of flaresbeing fired from the ground while the raids were in progress werebeing investigated, but these might refer to parachute flares dropped by the aircraft. The object of these raids by the enemy might befor training purposes or in order to interfere with our bombing operations against Germany.The R.D.F. station on Fair Island had been machine-gunnedfrom the air this morning.One hundred and sixty-three fighter sorties had been flownduring the previous twenty-four hours. Forty-three Hurricaneshad been sent as escorts to bombing raids in the Somme area, inwhich 38 Blenheims had been engaged. Direct hits had been madeon columns, road and rail crossings and the Somme bridges. FiveBlenheims had failed to return. Our own casualties in fightersamounted to 2 missing and 2 forced landed, as against 4 enemy aircraft confirmed and 4 unconfirmed.Heavy bombers had attacked the enemy&apos;s communications and oil targets during the night; also marshalling yards in the Ruhr.Visibility had not been good and the bombers which had attacked in the Abbeville-Amiens-Arras area could not find any troop movements, but they had bombed the railway bridge at Abbeville.The Hirson railway junction had also been attacked and thebuildings set on fire. The marshalling yards at Wedau and Durenappeared to have been successfully attacked. Reports of other attacks were not yet available.Mining operations had been carried out in the enemy&apos;s waters.Blenheim bombers despatched to attack a force of 21 enemy motortorpedo boa,ts reported off Terschelling had failed to find their objective.In addition to the usual anti-invasion patrols, anti-submarine patrols and convoy escorts, a special search had been made for enemy vessels in the neighbourhood of the Faroe Islands, without result.At dusk on the previous evening a Hudson had bombed whatwas thought to be an enemy submarine in an unrestricted area. Itlater appeared that this vessel was H.M. Submarine Swordfish, but she had sustained no damage.Details were given of the operations of the British Air Forcesin France during the last two days, in which operations had beencarried out against road communications and movements on the somme front. Our total casualties for the two days amounted toone Hurricane lost, compared with 7 enemy aircraft confirmed (one by ground defences) and 6 unconfirmed.The Secretary of State for Air said that the production andfitting of the AT. apparatus to Blenheims was being pressed forward with all possible speed.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The western front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 156thConclusions,Minute 2.)[21392]. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that 5 enemy armoured divisions had been identified as taking part in the Germanthrust to the east of Amiens. These had sustained considerablecasualties from the French defence, but the French were unable tosupply the infantry posts in the forward areas, which were still holding out behind the enemy tanks, and might have to withdrawthem. The Montdidier area was very favourable to the enemy&apos;stank operations.   Further to the east, along the Aisne, the Frenchb 2
had a very strong line which should be able to hold out. They wereactively forming reserves, but it would be some time before theimprovised formations of mechanised units were ready for action.On the extreme left of the front the 51st Division were being very hard pressed, and the situation gave cause for considerable anxiety. A line in rear was being occupied by improvisedformations of base details and Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corpsin order to cover Rouen. The danger was that the 51st Divisionmight be forced back into the Havre peninsula, and it had been impressed on the Commander that, if he had to fall back, it shouldbe in the direction of Rouen. The Admiralty were sending2 destroyers to give artillery support to the left flank of the51st Division. General Pownall, who had gone over to see general george, would be returning shortly and would be able to report thesituation on this part of the front and the reasons why the FrenchTenth Army had been unable to give any further support to the51st Division, who were strung out on a very wide front (nearly20 miles).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that a Committeeof officers from the British Expeditionary Force had been formed toexamine the lessons to be learnt from the recent fighting in France.Their report would be produced as quickly as possible. Any infor-mation which might emerge as to the best method of dealing withtanks would be passed on to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces.Some discussion took place on the provision of further assistance to the French, a record of which is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 156thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The First Sea Lord said that the armed merchant cruiserCarinthia, which had been torpedoed 80 miles west of BloodyForeland, was now in tow by a minesweeper with 2 destroyersescorting her.Two magnetic mines ha.d been exploded by &quot; L &quot; sweeps whenthe channel was being swept for the passage of H.M.S. Nelson fromPortsmouth.S.S. Harcola, which had been mined off the North Goodwins,had now been beached. S.S. Eros, bound from Montreal to Liverpoolwith a general cargo and 4 Hurricane aircraft on board, was reported sinking off the north-west of Ireland, probably as a resultof torpedo attack.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.Merchant shipspassing throughthe Suez Canal.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 155thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the admiralty had been informed that recently a special charge of  E. 190 had been imposed by the Canal Company on certain Italian ships passing-through the Canal in respect of tugs which the Canal Companyinsisted should follow them up. British armed guards were alsoplaced on these ships. This charge had caused a great deal of localcomplaint by the Italians, and he suggested that the charge should in future be waived and previous charges reimbursed.In discussion, it was generally agreed that, since the charge was made in order to protect the property of the Canal Company, itshould properly be met by the Company and not by the BritishGovernment. The sum involved, however, was small, and, in orderto put an end to any friction as quickly as possible, it would bedesirable to adjust the matter immediately with the Italian shipping companies and to take up the question of reimbursement and futureincidence of the charge with the Canal Company later.
391 W.M. 1S7 (40).Contraband The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that one or two ofcontrol. the Italian ships which it had been desired to intercept had slipped(Previousthrough the Straits of Gibraltar before they could be picked up.Reference:        Three ships, however, had been brought into Gibraltar the previous.M. (40) 156th night,exclusions, Tbe War Cabinet-(i) Agreed that, as an interim measure, any special chargesimposed on Italian ships passing through the Suez Canal(e.g., in respect of tugs sent to accompany them on security grounds) should be met, in the first instance, bythe British Government from Navy votes, and that italian shipping companies should be reimbursed inrespect of charges already levied,(ii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to open negotia-tions with the Suez Canal Company with a view to theirwaiving such charges in future and repaying any sumsalready disbursed by the British Government inaccordance with (i) above.France.Recognition ofFrench efforts.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of Ministers to the importance of making suitablereference to the French achievements, as well as to British forces,in public speaking or broadcasting.In this connexion there was some discussion as to the award ofdecorations to General Blanchard and Admiral Abrial.The War Cabinet-(i) Invited Ministers to bear in mind the advisability ofmaking suitable references to French achievements in public speeches or broadcasts,(ii) Took note that the Prime Minister would submit animmediate recommendation to His Majesty The King inregard to the award of suitable decorations to general blanchard and Admiral Abrial.Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 154thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome (No. 831,dated the 5th June), from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo(No. 459, dated the 6th June), and from the British Minister at athens (No. 395, dated the 5th June), all of which supported theview that Signor Mussolini had decided to bring Italy into the war at an early date.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Italian Consulat Newcastle had instructed all Italian ships to sail at once, andthat appropriate action was being taken to delay their departure.The War Cabinet took note of this information.The Balkans,SuggestedmobilisationGreece and yugoslavia.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that wehad now heard that the Turkish Government had receivedby discouraging replies from the Greek and Yugoslav Governments totheir suggestion that the two latter should mobilise at the same time as Turkey, in the event of war breaking out with Italy. It mightbe possible to pursue the matter further at a later date, but therewas no hope of securing their immediate agreement with theTurkish suggestion (telegram No. 486 DIPP, from His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Ankara, dated the 5th June, 1940).
8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the atten-tion of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 8, dated the 5th June, fromHis Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Barcelona, reporting that he hadreceived an unsigned letter purporting to be from an anti-NaziGerman political official. This conveyed the warning that theGerman &quot; Secret Weapon &quot; consisted of aeroplanes of British andFrench type which were in mass production in Germany, andpainted with Allied colours, and would be used to launch a massattack upon the Allied Fleets.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that this report hadalready been brought to the notice of Naval Commanders-in-Chief.The Chief of the Air Staff did not think that it would be practicable for the Germans to produce a large number of aeroplanes of Alliedtypes. Arrangements were also in force which would in any casemake it difficult for German aircraft to carry out such an operation as was suggested without being suspected.The War Cabinet took note of this information.Germany.Suggested useof aeroplanes ofAllied types.Belgium.His Majesty&apos;ambassador.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that news had now been received, through the United States Embassy inGermany, that Sir Lancelot Oliphant was a prisoner in Berlin.Representations would be made that, as a Member of the diplomatic corps, he was entitled to be released.No news had yet been received as to our Military Attache in brussels.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.German Oil 10.
