It was thought that not more than 60,000 British troops were nowleft behind the line of perimeter defence which ran from a pointbetween Gravelines and Dunkirk to Nieuport. Practically all our troops were now behind this line; small rear guards might havebeen cut off, but it was not thought that many troops had been lost in this way.The position in regard to the French was that one French Corpshad withdrawn within the perimeter defence. The other french divisions had said that they were too tired to continue the march to the coast, and must be regarded as cut off. It was clear that if our troops had waited any longer for the French they would have suffered the same fate.The perimeter defence was, of course, being held to enableFrench troops as well as our own, to be withdrawn. There had beena conference on the matter with the French authorities on theprevious day, and the beaches west of Dunkirk had been allotted to the French. Later, owing to the French troops near Gravelineshaving been driven back, these beaches had come under shell-fire,and a third of the beaches east of Dunkirk had been allotted to theFrench. The French troops on the beaches were not in formedbodies. At one time the position in regard to the embarkation ofFrench troops had threatened serious trouble; but matters had beeneased.The troops first evacuated had consisted mainly of line ofcommunication troops, but a considerable number of fighting troops had now been successfully embarked. It was, of course, necessaryto leave good troops to hold the perimeter line, since, if this was forced, further evacuation would be impossible. It was thoughtthat the perimeter line might be held for, say, another two or three days. After that time the enemy would probably bring up artillery,and the beaches would be under fire.The Lord President of the Council recalled that on the19th May, Lord Gort had proposed to fall back and make a bridge-head round the Channel Ports. This suggestion had not, at thattime, been accepted, and the view had been taken that the right course was to make a push to the South, in order to join up with theFrench Armies South of the Somme (W.M. (40) 130th Conclusions,Minute 1, Confidential Annex). This move had proved impossible.He supposed that the withdrawal was now being carried out undermuch more difficult conditions than if Lord Gorfs suggestion hadbeen adopted in the first instance.In the discussion which ensued, it was pointed out that the move to the South to close the gap had undoubtedly offered theonly hope of saving the Armies of the North as complete units,with their equipment. This move had proved impossible from twocauses : first, that the French forces South of the Somme had been unable to make an effective push in time. This had been due in part to the bombing of the French railway communications; which haddelayed the concentration of units South of the Somme; secondly,the pressure of the German forces on the Armies of the North had prevented those Armies from disengaging sufficient forces to makea push to the South.The position at The Lord President of the Council referred to the statementCalais. in the Press that morning that Calais was still holding out.
It was not believed that there was any justification for this statement, but the Secretary of State for War agreed that a furtheraerial reconnaissance should be carried out.Future German In reply to questions, the Chief of the Imperial General Staffintentions. said that he doubted whether there was any truth in the reports inthe Press that parachutists had been landed near Paris. Thesuggestion in Rome telegram No. 726 that the next German movewas likely to be an attack on Paris launched east of Amiens, was,he thought, in accordance with probabilities.The War Cabinet considered the instructions which should besent to Lord Gort, and approved the text of a telegram to be sentto him.&apos;(fcrj?y oM^cL^LJThe War Cabinet took note of this statement.communication to Lord.

Reynauddrawing attention to the number of encouraging features in thesituation.  The following were mentioned : (1) The very great successes achieved by the R.A.F. on the29th May. The enemy losses had been 70 aircraft (con-firmed) shot doAvn, against a loss of 14 of our machines.Thirty-seven aircraft had been shot down by a singlesquadron of Defiants, without loss.(2) The encouraging figures of production of aircraft enginesfrom the Rolls-Rovce factory.(3) Telegram No. 269 DIPP from Belgrade, which reportedthat an important Yugoslav, who had just returned fromGermany, said that conditions there were terribly bad,and that Austria was croAvded with wounded, which was having a serious effect on the morale of the people.(4) Telegram No. 707 from Rome reporting that a German,before leaving for Germany, had stated that, althoughGermany was winning the war easily, her losses were soheavy that she could not continue for long at such a rate.The War Cabinet agreed That the Prime Minister should send an encouragingmessage to M.

It seemed that theI.R.A. forces were by themselves almost strong enoughto over-run the weak Eire forces. We must thereforebe ready to send forces to Southern Ireland.(3) The Foreign Secretary enquired whether good progress wasbeing made with defence works and preparations fordemolitions in this country.
