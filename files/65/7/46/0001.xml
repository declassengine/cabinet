The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff Committee regarding proposals for affording military support to Afghanistan (W.P. (40) 179).The Chief of the Air Staff recalled that in accordance with theconclusions of the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 5th Aprilan assurance had been conveyed to the Afghan Government that,in the event of action by Soviet forces, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be prepared to give them all the assistance in their power.This assurance did not, however, cover an undertaking to defend the Afghan northern frontier. The Government of India, in their appreciation, had recommended that land support to the Afghanscould best be achieved by a simultaneous advance (i) by the NorthernLine to support the Afghan Government in the Kabul area, and(ii) by the Southern Line to the Kandahar area. The forces required for this purpose were set out in paragraph 6 of the Chiefsof Staff Report, from which it would be seen that, whilst theGovernment of India could raise and equip the additional infantry battalions and ancillary units by May 1941, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were asked to provide 14 R.A.F. Squadrons and certain anti-aircraft units and equipment.It was clear that, in present circumstances, it was impracticable to afford the assistance desired by the Government of India to implement the plan. The Chiefs of Staff had accordingly recom-mended that the Commander-in-Chief in India should prepare an interim plan which could be put into effect with existing resources at his disposal. In addition, it was recommended that the Govern-ment of India should not be released from their obligations toprovide forces for Iran/Iraq and that everything possible shouldbe done to enlist the sympathy of the tribesmen on both sides of thefrontier.The Secretary of State for India said that the difficulty ofproviding the air squadrons and anti-aircraft equipment was fully realised and that the Government of India would have to accept theposition. Meanwhile, plans were proceeding at full pressure forthe raising of the additional troops in India, part of which, at anyrate, would be available for operations, not only in Afghanistan,but elsewhere if required.He fully concurred with the recommendation regarding theattitude of the tribes, which was reported to be favourable at thepresent time. He was in communication with the Viceroy, with aview to the appointment of special officers for the furtherance ofthis object.The Government of India would accordingly have to make thebest plan possible for the support of the Afghan Government inthe Kabul area and this, he thought, might take the form of thedespatch of a Military Mission and technical units or personnel.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff, asset out in paragraph 16 of their Report.(b) Invited the Secretary of State for India to inform theGovernment of India accordingly, and to request themto forward proposals for an interim plan based on resources at present available in India.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India regarding the enactment in anemergency of the draft Revolutionary Movements Ordinance(W.P. (G.) (40) 142).The Secretary of State for India said that the draft of thisOrdinance had been approved in principle in October 1937, subject[21368]
to the condition that it should not be enacted without specificCabinet authority. The Viceroy would continue his policy of conciliation up to the last possible moment, but he must have in reserve the power to act at once in the event of this policy provingunsuccessful. The powers to be conferred on the Central Govern-ment were less drastic than those at present in operation in theUnited Kingdom.General agreement was expressed with the view that theViceroy should have full authority, subject to consultation with theSecretary of State for India, to assume all the powers which he required for dealing with a revolutionary movement.The War Cabinet :-Authorised the Secretary of State for India, withoutfurther reference to the War Cabinet, to permit theViceroy to enact the Revolutionary Movements Ordinancein any emergency in which he satisfied the Secretary ofState for India that the necessity for it had arisen.Supreme War 3.   The Prime Minister gave an account of the Meeting of theCouncil: Supreme War Council held on the previous day.   The French10th Meeting. Government had been represented by M. Reynaud, Marshal Petainand General Weygand. Considering how critical the situation was,the results of the Meeting had been very satisfactory. He read overthe Resolutions which had been agreed after the Meeting.(The Resolutions of the Supreme War Council are being circulated as W.P. (40) 188.)Evacuation of A satisfactory agreement had been reached on the policy for allied Forces     the evacuation of the Allied forces from Dunkirk,from Dunkirk.Norway.Future british assistance toFrance.Plans for air offensive againstItalianindustries.The French had accepted in full our proposals regarding thefuture of operations in Norway.The French expected a further attack on the French Armies inthe west very shortly and had made an urgent plea that we shoulddespatch reinforcements of land and air forces as early as possible.They had emphasised that their formations were only able to hold the present line very thinly. The Prime Minister&apos;s own view wasthat, now that we had got off such a large proportion of the british expeditionary Force, we should send some additional troops toFrance, complete with the necessary air component. every endeavour should also be made to reopen our long-range air attacks on German industry.M. Reynaud had been told that we would send down some heavy bomber squadrons to assist the French in attacking Italianindustries, and that servicing units were already proceeding.Reference was also made to naval plans.The Prime Minister thought that it would be necessary for the vice--Chief of the Air Staff and a member of the Naval Staff to goover to Paris and concert the plans in detail with the french authorities.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the WarCabinet a communication which he had received from Sir percy loraine on this subject, which could be summarised as follows : -It was very doubtful whether the Italian Air Force was ina position to defend their aircraft industries since, the italian aircraft were of inferior types, their reserves were inadequate,and there were no proper arrangements for anti-aicraft andpassive defence in the industrial area. Nevertheless, Mussolinimight feel that the losses which the British Air Forces had
9tqJL -w&apos;&apos;Crete.(previous reference erence  :W.M. (40) 148thConclusions,Minute 8.)Tangier.sustained in recent operations would be sufficient to offset thesedisadvantages. Accordingly, in Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s view, thedespatch of a British bomber force to southern France wouldmake a very deep impression on the Italian Government. Hesuggested that he should be permitted to inform Count Cianothat we had every intention of taking immediate action withour bomber forces against Italian industry in the north, if italy chose to go to war with us. He would like also to saythat Air Commodore West, the Air Attache in Rome, wouldbe in command of the force, since the Italians would realise that his intimate knowledge of the disposition of the air forces and of the targets which were particularly vulnerable in NorthItaly would be applied to the best advantage.The Chief of the Air Staff said that a complete plan had been worked out for air attack on the Italian industries. He fully agreedthat it was most important to hit Italy a very hard blow right atthe outset of the war. But, if bomber squadrons were now sent to thesouth of France, they might be immobilised there for a considerable period if the entry of Italy into the war was long delayed. As soonas the servicing units were established in southern France the bombers could fly down direct and start operations at once. In themeantime, the bomber squadrons could be kept at home for operations against Germany. He could not agree that the presentAir Attache in Rome should be given command of the bomber force,which would be under the orders of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Bomber Command, but Air Commodore WesCs services could,of course, be placed at the disposal of the Commander in order thathis intimate knowledge of the area might be used to the best advantage.The Lord President of the Council suggested that it would besufficient if the Italians were informed that we had made all pre-reparations to start air attacks on their industry immediately afterthe outbreak of war. The despatch of the servicing units to southernFrance would be an earnest of these intentions.The Prime Minister thought that a very much deeperimpression would be made on Mussolini if the bomber squadronsthemselves were sent. He might not otherwise believe that we werein earnest. Moreover, if the squadrons were already there, the firstblow could be struck within an hour or so of the opening ofhostilities.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, referring to theFrench suggestion for seizing Crete immediately any act of hostilityagainst the Allies by Italy occurred, irrespective of whether Greekterritory had been violated or not, recalled that the Chiefs of staff had advised against this proposal, since, if we occupied Crete,Greece would inevitably be involved in hostilities with Italy, andthis would result in additional commitments which we were unwilling to undertake at the outset of hostilities.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that negotiations had been going on with the French with a view topersuading them to make a friendly gesture to Franco by offeringhim further representation in the control of Tangier. The french had been opposed to the idea, but, if the French now wanted to turna blind eye to a Spanish occupation of Tangier, it would be worthwhile reopening the question.  He undertook to do this.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the Resolutions of the 10th Meeting of theSupreme War Council,(ii) Agreed that representatives of the Naval and Air staffs should proceed to France as early as possible in order to
concert plans with the French High Command for actionagainst Italian industry in the event of Italy entering the war against us.*(iii) Approved the proposal of Sir Percy Loraine that he shouldbe authorised to inform Count Ciano that we had everyintention of taking immediate action with our bomberforces against Italian industry if Italy went to warwith us; and invited the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, in consultation with the Secretary of State forAir, to draft the necessary instructions to Sir percy loraine.(iv) Agreed that the Foreign Office, in consultation with theChiefs of Staff, should examine the desirability ofseizing Crete immediately after any act of hostilityagainst the Allies by Italy, irrespective of whether Greekterritory had been violated, as a preliminary to further consultation with the French Government on thisproposal.(v) Took note that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs would reopen negotiations with the French Government,with a view to persuading them to make a friendlygesture to General Franco by offering him furtherrepresentation in the control of Tangier.The Western 4.   The Secretary of State for War said that Lord Gort hadFront. arrived in England that morning and had reported that the shellingWithdrawal of and bombing of the beaches had been extremely severe, and that theB.E.F. front had been contracted, a shorter &apos;&quot;&apos; Corunna &quot; line being now(Previous held.   General Alexander, whom he had left in command, was reference:        finding it very difficult to continue to hold this line and to deal with.M. (40) 149th German infiltrations.   He was also made anxious by the fact that conclusions,      the French seemed to take the view that the position could be heldMinute l.)        for several more days.  Lord Gort thought that we should impress on the French that this was impossible, and that the maximumefforts must be made to get as many troops off as possible that night.On the previous day, owing to the shelling of the beaches allocated to the British, more French troops than British had been evacuated.They consisted largely of units which General Weygand hadparticularly asked to have evacuated.   General Blanchard had not come away with Lord Gort.A message had also been received from the French high command shortly before midnight to the effect that they were verydisturbed that we were trying to complete our evacuation that night.He had replied to this to the effect that we were making themaximum possible effort to evacuate that night and that we hoped for the full co-operation of the French on a fifty-fifty basis.The Prime Minister explained that, in the discussions theprevious day at the Supreme War Council in Paris, the French hadbeen told that the Germans could not be held off for more than 24or at the very most 48 hours. They had accepted the fact that theremains of General Blanchard&apos;s army, which was still nearArmentieres, was now definitely cut off by the German forces in theneighbourhood of Cassel; but they had thought that other french troops, which were believed to be between Cassel and the perimeter,ought to be given a chance to enter the perimeter and to join the iforces that were being evacuated. It had therefore been agreed inParis to send instructions to Admiral Abrial at Dunkirk that theforces within the perimeter should embark as soon as there were no more troops outside who could make their way inside; on thesuggestion of the British representatives, a sentence had been addedto the effect that the British were to form a rearguard for theoperation of embarkation.  He (the Prime Minister) was now clear* This conclusion was amended on the following day (see W.M. (40) 152ndConclusions, Minute 3).
Press announce-ment regardingLord Gorfsreturn.The Air 5.   The Chief of the Air Staff reported that 92 aircraft hadSituation. been operating in daylight the previous day and had carried out(Previous many successful attacks on German columns and concentrations on reference: tne roads in the Ypres-Dixmude-St. Omer-Cassel area. Only oneW.M. (40) 149th bomber had been lost during these operations. The reasons whyConclusions, our losses had been so very much less in daylight operations thanMinute 2.)        earlier in the battle were probably : (a) the withdrawal of German A.A. units to the southern front;(&amp;) the general confusion in the area, which resulted in anti-aircraft fire from the German columns being illco-ordinated;d (c) the provision of fighter escorts to the bombers;(d) the fact that our bombers were not penetrating so deepbehind the German front line.The weather had been unfavourable for the heavy bombers,which had not been able to attack targets in Germany the previous night. Thirty-three bombers had attacked targets in the Nieuportarea and south of St. Omer.  Two of these bombers had been lost.Over Dunkirk there had been very heavy fighting during theprevious evening, in which large German formations had beenthat the embarkation must be finished that night and that there wasno hope for any French troops that were still outside the perimeter.The Chief of Naval Staff said that on naval grounds it was essential to complete the evacuation that night. Nearly all the destroyers engaged in these operations had now suffered damage.Many of the smaller craft also had been sunk or wrecked, and theGermans now had guns in position to shell the only channel by which shipping could approach Dunkirk in the day time. The hundredfishing vessels which the French had offered had not appeared andC&apos; the steamers on which they were evacuating troops were being sentto Le Havre, instead of making the short journey to the Englishcoast so as to be available for further trips. He asked that theFrench should be urged to give the maximum amount of help that night, and also that they should accept the responsibility for the subsequent evacuation of the garrison which the French proposed tomaintain in Dunkirk itself.The Prim,e Minister urged that we should bear in mind thatwe were in fact finding it possible to evacuate to this country avery high proportion of the British troops engaged in the Flandersoperations, while the number of French troops lost would be verymuch greater than our own.In the light of this discussion the Secretary of State for Warasked the authority of the War Cabinet for the Chief of theImperial General Staff to despatch the following telegram to theFrench Military Authorities : &quot; All evidence, naval and military, shows that every effort must be made to complete evacuation to-night. Strongly urge that Admiral Abrial be instructed to co-operate in this effort inthe interests of our two Armies.Only remaining channel now coming under fire of Germanguns which will put an end to all evacuation by day definitely.&quot;The War Cabinet approved the despatch of this telegram.The Secretary of State for War read to the War Cabinet a draft announcement to be issued to the Press explaining that owing tothe small number-^of British troops now remaining in FranceLord Gort had been instructed to return to this country, leaving a less senior military officer in command.   This was approved.
encountered, including one squadron of the new Heinkel 113, a veryfast and efficient fighter. It was believed that only one squadron of this type existed. It seemed as if the Germans had arrangeda system of observation posts on the coast which warned theirbombers when our fighters were coming over. The bombers thenwithdrew, and after the battle between the opposing fighters haddied down the bombers returned to their task. The fighting theprevious day had been particularly fierce, possibly due to the publicity which we had given to the successful action of the Defiants,which had stung the Germans into increased efforts. Twenty of our fighters had been lost, but some of the pilots had been picked upby the ships which were evacuating the B.E.F. In all 42 german aircraft (certain) had been shot down, of which 18 were bombers and 24 were fighters. The unconfirmed German losses amounted to7 bombers and 7 fighters. Heavy fighting was again going on overDunkirk that morning, in which we had lost 6 fighters. The Germanlosses so far were thought to be 14 certain and 5 unconfirmed.Other operations carried out by the Royal Air Force on theprevious day included attacks on oil tanks at Bergen and Rotterdam,both of which were believed to have been demolished completely.One German motor torpedo boat had been sunk and some mine-laying had been carried out. Three aircraft had been lost in these operations.The total losses for the 31st May amounted to : German : 42 confirmed.14 unconfirmed.British : 26.The Prime Minister said that the operations for the evacuation of the Allied forces from Dunkirk had been the first real trial of strength between the British and German Air Forces. The germans had a perfect target in the masses of ships and men at Dunkirk,which the)r would certainly have made every effort possible to destroy. Nevertheless, they had failed conspicuously in the attemptand had suffered losses far heavier than our own. We had achievedour purpose and saved our Army, and there could be no doubt thatthis constituted a signal victory for the Royal Air Force, which gave cause for high hopes of our success in the future. The wholeoperation reflected the very highest credit on the Air Ministry andon the Royal Air Force, and he hoped that a special Order of theDay would be issued to the Royal Air Force, impressing upon allpersonnel the great success which had been achieved and the severity of the blow which they had struck at the enemy.The War Cabinet (1) Took note of the above statements.(2) Expressed their high appreciation of the magnificentachievement of the Royal Air Force in successfullycovering the evacuation of the Allied forces from dunkirk.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 149thConclusions,Minute 3.)German attacks on shipping.6. The Chief of Naval Staff reported the following casualties to HM. ships taking part in the evacuation during the previous24 hours: H.M.S.

It appearedprobable that the bomb had been placed on board either at london or Antwerp.The War Cabinet were given details of movements of the fastAustralian and New Zealand convoy. There had been a consider-able amount of sickness amongst the troops and it had been foundnecessary to delay the convoy at Capetown. It was expected,however, that most of the lost time would be made up.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Norway.BBC.Announcement.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 150thConclusions.)regard to7. The First Sea Lord read a message from Lord Cork ina B.B.C. announcement as to the position in Norway.Lord Cork regarded this announcement as most indiscreet, and suggested that disciplinary action should be taken against those responsible for it.The Admiralty had investigated the matter and it appeared that the B.B.C. statement had been an extract from an announce-ment by the Norwegian High Command, reporting that the Allieddefences had been driven back and that Bodo had been evacuated.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Germany.Reported new types of aircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 59thConclusions,Minute 1.)Modification ofmagnetic mines.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs drew attentionto telegram No. 352 DIPP, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Athens,stating that the Greek Air Ministry Intelligence reported two new types of German aircraft under construction.   These were :  (1) Heinkel 177 four-engined bomber (speed, 480 kilometresper hour; range, 2,000 kilometres; load, one 1,000 or1,500-kilogram bomb or four mines or one torpedo).(2) Type T.U. 90 under construction at the aviation factory,capable of carrying a light tank.These aircraft were destined for parachute divisions.It was also reported from the same source that the magneticmine had been modified in such a way as to make degaussingineffective.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Chief of the Air Staff to submit a Memo-randum on the two new types of aircraft reported to be under construction in Germany.United States ofAmerica.Suggestedappeal by AlliedGovernments.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 145thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 874 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington,reporting that he had consulted the Under-Secretary of State that morning about the joint appeal to the United States which it hadbeen proposed that the British and French Governments shouldmake. Mr. Welles had said that the President had already con-sidered this proposal and had telegraphed to the United states ambassador at Paris strongly advising against it, on the groundthat any such appeal would only put difficulties in the way of hisown efforts to get materials over to the Allies as quickly as possible,and would hinder the evolution of American opinion. The Under-Secretary of State had, however, thought that a broadcast by thePrime Minister addressed to the Empire would be very helpful.[21368] c
Although not directed to the United States, such a broadcast wouldbe heard by all Americans. Lord Lothian added that he would be making a short speech which would be broadcast throughout theUnited States on Tuesday next.The Prime M inister said that he proposed to broadcast a speech on the lines suggested in this telegram on the evening of Wednesday next.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.United States of 10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heAmerica. had recently discussed with the United States Ambassador theSupply of prospects of our obtaining destroyers from the United States,destroyers.

Legislation might be necessary, but he thought that in theConclusions, new atmosphere now developing this would not present difficulties.Minute 4.) The Secretary of State suggested that the Prime minister might consider, in the light of the record of this conversation,whether he himself could usefully take any action in the samedirection.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.France.Supply of coal from thiscountry.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 113thConclusions,Minute 11.)11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that discussions had been taking place between the Departments con-cerned about the supply of coal to France from this country. Therewere many factors involved and he thought that it would be ofadvantage if the Minister without Portfolio could be invited totake the matter up with a view to reaching an early decision.The War Cabinet: &apos;Invited the Minister without Portfolio to consider as amatter of urgency, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, the question of the supply of coal to Francefrom this country.Invasion of 12.   The Lord President of the Council said that the RegionalGreat Britain. Commissioner for the Eastern Counties had reported that there wasNeed for a considerable apprehension amongst the public in that part of thereassuring country regarding the possibility of an early invasion.   He (thestatement. Lord President) suggested that a broadcast statement designed to(Previous calm these fears should be made at an early date.   If the WarReference: Cabinet agreed, the terms of the statement might be discussed byW.M (40) 148th fiim with the Minister of Information.Conclusions, Secretary of State for War suggested that the HomeMinute 10) Defence Executive should also be consulted.The War Cabinet agreed : To invite the Lord President of the Council, in consul-tation with the Minister of Information and the HomeDefence Executive, to arrange for a reassuring statement to be broadcast about the possibility of invasion of thiscountry.

Thg Lord pres^ent 0j tjie Council said that he thought that(Previous the War Cabinet would be in general agreement with the ReportEef erence: of the chiefs of Staff, but he asked whether, in the light of theW.M. (40) 147th iatest information, some further action should not be taken immediately, as, for example, the provision of means for ensuringinstant communication with Eire in the event of the normal meansof communication being cut. Again, we ought to be ready to sendover forces immediately, if the Germans attempted to seize places in Eire, so as to dislodge them before they had established them-selves.The Chief of the A ir Staff said that measures to meet thesetwo points were ah^eady in hand.In further discussion, the view was expressed that, the moment the Geimtans attempted to land troops in Eire, the country wouldrally to our side, but that in present circumstances we could not hope that the Eire Government would allow us to co-operate openlyin the defence of Eire, until Eire was attacked.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 183).(2) Took note that the Lord President of the Council would consult with the Chiefs of Staff Committee in regard toany further measures which it might be necessary totake to guard against a German attack on Eire.Lord Gort.14.   The War Cabinet then received Lord Gort.Account of theoperations of theB.E.F.,Mav 1940.After the War Cabinet had greeted LordGort, the PrimeMinister congratulated the Commander-in-Chief on havingsucceeded in extricating the B.E.F. from a position of great dangerunder the most harassing conditions, and on the firm front whichthe force had shown. Lord Gort had shown the greatest skill and determination in his leadership, and the troops under his command had maintained steadfast composure under the most trying con-ditions. While they had necessarily lost their heavy stores, the way in which the men had come away, in disciplined bodies, with their full equipment, was most praiseworthy.The manner in which Lord Gort had conducted these most difficult operations was most highly commended by the WarCabinet. He had no doubt that Parliament and the country wouldexpress the same view.Lord Gort thanked the Prime Minister for what he had said.At the Prime Minister&apos;s invitation, he gave the War Cabinet an account of the recent operations in Belgium. He said that, so faras concerned the advance into Belgium, things had gone according to plan. The B.E.F. had arrived on the Dyle well up to schedule.They had not been assisted, however, by the King of the Belgians&apos;request that they should not go through the centre of Brussels.When they had reached the Dyle line they had found that the belgians had not carried out the work which they had undertaken to. There had been no continuous anti-tank obstacles in theGembloux gap. The de Cointet obstacle had been moved forward to a line running through Perwez, and there were large gaps in itin front of the British sector. None of the other river lines backto the Escaut had been organised for defence.General Gamelin had not had the temps utile on the Dyle towhich he had looked forward, as the resistance of the Belgian forcesopposite the Maestricht peninsula had collapsed almost at once.The speed of the German advance had coincided almost exactly withthe estimate of the G.H.Q. Intelligence Staff.[21368] &quot; c 2
The next trouble he had had to face had been that the french army on his right under General Blanchard had not had the powersof resistance anticipated. It had comprised a number of units of native troops which had been shattered by the effect of dive-bombing and tanks. The same thing had happened in the case of the troopsholding Dinant, who had retreated as soon as they were attacked by dive-bombing.General Blanchard was of the professorial type. He had noinitiative, no drive and no determination, and some of hissubordinate Commanders had no confidence in him. Again, therehad been a lack of any real co-ordination. The British had alwaysurged that they should have French troops on their left, but this had not been fulfilled, and they had found themselves with the belgians on their left and the French on their right. The time takenin effecting co-ordination with the armies of two different allies had added to his difficulties.General Billotte, who had been appointed to be the GrandCo-coordinator of the Allied Armies of the North, had been a great disappointment. In person a big, impressive man, he was in factcompletely flabby. During the four days on the Dyle Lord Gortsaid he had received only one order from General Billotte, and that had been given to him as a result of pressure which he had himselfbrought to bear on General Billotte. General Billotte had ordereda stand on the Antwerp-Wavre-Charleroi line, but at the time this order had been given the French were already requesting our AirForce to bomb Charleroi. In other words, the order had been outof date at the time when it had been given.Lord Gort said that it had become obvious that we should haveto retire from the Dyle line. A plan of retirement had been arranged with the French, but the latter had begun to retire before the houragreed upon. It was no uncommon occurrence to agree with theFrench to retire at, say, 9 p.m., and to find that the French troops on the line had, in fact, begun to go back at 4.Lord Gort said that the next step which he had taken had been to interview the King of the Belgians. He had had a talk with him at Antwerp and had found the King in a very nervous condition.His Chief of Staff, General von Overstraeten, who was a courtierand not a soldier, had been in an even worse condition. It had beena pity we had not known earlier the type of man we had to deal with.The King had been in tears and General von Overstraeten almoststunned. No real direction had been given to the Belgian Army, andthe resistance of the Belgian troops on the Albert line had by this time collapsed.Lord Gort said that, when he had said that it was impossibleto continue to hold the line in front of Brussels, the King andGeneral von Overstraeten had accepted this view. When the Britishtroops had retired, he had blown up the bridges in front of their part of the line. The French, unfortunately, had not done so, andas a result German tanks had been able to get through.Lord Gort said that the other cardinal mistake which had beenmade had been the action of the French in sending General Giraud&apos;s army into Holland. There was only one line of approach intosouthern Holland, namely, through Antwerp. There there was asingle bridge and a tunnel which depended for its ventilation on two ventilation plants. One of these had been knocked out by aGerman bomb, and the safety of the whole of General Giraud&apos;s army had depended on the other plant l^emaining intact.This French army had done no good in Holland. When theFrench had found there was a big gap in their line and that theyhad no reserves to fill it, they had at once given orders to general giraud&apos;s&apos;s army to retire. The result had been that almost all ofGeneral Giraud&apos;s army had withdrawn across the lines of communi-cation of the British forces.  This had given rise to great confusion.
The next stage in the battle had been the Escaut line. Thiswas a difficult line to hold, but the Belgians had been keen to holdit in order to secure Ghent. Our part of the line had been moredifficult to hold by the reported action of the French in turning onthe water to flood their part of the line, and thereby decreasing theamount of water in front of our sector. The 44th Division holdingthe line in front of Oudenarde had been driven in by heavy german attacks. Lord Gort said that he had seen the King of the Belgiansand had told him that he thought it was necessary to retire to theline of the Lys. The King of the Belgians had agreed to do so,although he had said that, in his view, the line of the Lys was nota good line to hold. Lord Gort had offered to ease matters by extending our front up to Courtrai in order to help the Belgians;but he had stipulated that the Belgians must maintain contact between their right flank and our left flank. He had also stipulated that they should start flooding the line of the Yser from Dixmudeto Nieuport.   This the King of the Belgians had undertaken to do.When they had got back to the line of the frontier defences, theFrench had had a large number of Divisions occupying a relatively short front on the line from Conde through Valenciennes towardsBethune. The French had said that their men were extremelyexhausted and could do no more. It had been irritating to see theFrench sitting doing nothing, and saying that they were incapable of movement, although they had done less than our army, who had fought all day long and marched all night.At this point, it had been suggested that the B.E.F. should makea push to the south, to meet a French thrust northwards from southof the Somme. Lord Gort said that he had never had very muchfaith in this French thrust. Nevertheless, he had spoken to theChief of the Imperial General Staff, who was visiting GeneralBillotte, and had said that he would put in an attack with two divisions towards Arras on the line of the Scarpe. It had been understood from General Weygand that the French would make anattack at the same time from the direction of Peronne. Lord Gortsaid that he had then gone to see General Blanchard and had urgedhim to capture Cambrai. General Blanchard had been unwilling toattempt this. He (Lord Gort) had said that General Blanchardmight at least send out a force to see whether there were any large forces of Germans in Cambrai. General Blanchard had agreed to doso. Next day he had said that his troops had advanced to Cambrai,but that they had been attacked by dive-bombing, and, as the Britishfighters had not come to their help, they had had to retire. general blanchard had said that his troops were epuise and could do no more. General de la Laurencie had been extremely dissatisfied withthe French Command and had wished to come under his (LordGorfs) Command, but he had explained that this was a matter forthe French and British Governments.The next morning General Billotte had come to see him at 1 a.m.and had said that he wished to show Lord Gort a map. This maphad shown the gap in the line as occupied by eight Panzer Divisions,and with the heads of some 16 other Infantry Divisions followingthem. General Billotte had said : &apos;&apos; What can I do ? &quot; and had indicated that an attack was to be made the following afternoon bysome &quot; divisions cuirassees &quot; from the south. After that, the effort would be finished.  He had been terribly depressed.Lord Gort said that he had then gone to see the King of the belgians, who had again assured him that steps had been taken toflood the Yser line. Although he had made three requests on thismatter, he believed that proper steps were never taken by the belgians to flood the Yser.Lord Gort said that the next day he had gone to see general blanchard at Dunkirk, and had found the General with the AdmiralNord and General Fagalde in a concrete fort. The Admiral andGeneral Fagalde had been in this fort for some days, almost without
leaving it, and, therefore, took a somewhat detached view of theposition.  Nevertheless, they had been thoroughly depressed.At Dunkirk at about 11 p.m. he had also seen General Koeltz,who had said to him : &apos;&apos; Do you realise that the King of the Belgiansis asking for an armistice at midnight ? &quot; He (Lord Gort) had saidthat this was news to him. The Belgian Staff had told him that theywere retiring to the north, and he had protested at their failure tomaintain contact with his left flank. The immediate task had been to fill the gap between ourselves and the Belgians. The 12th Lancershad used their armoured cars as mobile pillboxes, and he had pushedin other troops to occupy the line of the Ypres-Comines Canal.They had had a piece of good fortune, however, in that aGerman Staff Officer, who had been killed, had had amongst hispapers plans for the various German thrusts; these included anattack by a German corps on the Ypres-Comines Canal. Lord Gortsaid that he had turned all the medium and heavy artillery ofI Corps on to meet this attack, and he thought that they had giventhe Germans a great deal more than they cared for.At one moment the B.E.F. had been holding some 80 miles offront. On the line Douai-St. Omer they had blown up every bridge and they had put in small forces to guard the line. The french troops, when they saw the Germans advancing, were apt to retire.This had happened at Carvin, but a territorial battalion of theNorthumberland Fusiliers had counter-attacked and driven the- Germans back.The next day General Blanchard had come to see him. He(Lord Gort) had told him that his orders were to withdraw to thecoast with a view to embarkation. General Blanchard had said thathis army could move no further, that his troops were exhausted, andthat General Prioux and General Altmayer were determined to fightmatters out where they stood. He (Lord Gort) had said that while there was life there was hope. He had told the French that he would hold the line Cassel-Ypres, and that they should come back on tothat line. The French had said that, if the British occupied this position, they would expose the French flank. He had replied thathe could not under his orders stay where he was and sacrifice theB.E.F. General Blanchard had then gone off, heavy of heart,apparently resigned to do nothing. General de la Laurencie, whenhe heard what had passed, had gone to General Blanchard and askedleave to take his corps to join Lord Gort. General Blanchard hadallowed him to do so. General de la Laurencie had abandoned histransport, and had marched his men to the north and had come intothe Dunkirk perimeter with over 5,000 men. Lord Gort had pressed strongly that arrangements should be made to ship General de laLaurencie&apos;s men back to England, and he hoped that this had beendone. It was also worthy of note that, notwithstanding what hadbeen said about fighting it out where they stood, General Altmayerhad also turned up at Dunkirk the day before.Lord Gort said that he had pressed General Blanchard to returnto England with him, since he was no longer in command of any bodyof troops.   General Blanchard, however, had not received instruc-tions from General Weygand to leave.General Lord Gort said that the German generalship had been extremelycomments on good, and the junior leadership had also been first-rate. Their staff the position. work, he thought, was no better than ours. The individual Germanleadership was, however, remarkable. He saw some signs that theGerman bombers had begun to lose their nerve. It was not unusualto see them break away from formation and drop their bombsanywhere in the fields.It was the German tactics to feel for the soft spot and, havingfound it, to press hard. They made great use of trench mortars anddive-bombing, both of which frightened the French troops. Hethought that we should make more use of trench mortars, which wereeasy to move about.   The French &quot; Char-B &quot; had been useful, but
their Hotchkiss tanks had not been a success and had suffered veryheavily.Asked by the Lord President of the Council whether ourequipment had been satisfactory, Lord Gort said that our equipmenthad done extremely well. Both our 2-pdr. anti-tank gun and ourBofors gun (although without the predictor) had been a great success. Our &quot; I &quot; tanks had succeeded in covering great distances.They had gone up to 40 miles a day, whereas they were not supposed to go more than 10 miles a day, but they had suffered rather severelyfrom mechanical defects towards the end. Perhaps our main defectwas the absence of a tank with a gun. It was better to have a gunin an armoured car than a tank without a gun in it.Lord Gort then described the position at Dunkirk. He thoughtthat it would probably be possible to hold the line until the night ofthe lst/2nd June, but it might be a near thing. It had already been necessary to close in the perimeter defence line to the frontier.There had been some danger at Bergues earlier, but the flooding had now made this area safer. He was certain that no time should be wasted, and that every effort should be made to finish the evacuationon the night the 1st/2nd June. It might well be that there were more French than British troops in the perimeter, but he doubted if there were many French troops of real fighting quality left inDunkirk.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 1, 1940.
