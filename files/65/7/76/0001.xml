France. 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the contraband Minister of Economic Warfare on the contraband control of goodscontrol of goods destined for France (W.P. (40) 221).destined for The minister jor Economic Warfare said that there were three points on which he would be glad to have the approval of the WarCabinet for the line which he proposed to take :  (i) He proposed that contraband control should be exercised,so far as possible, in respect of all ships destined forany port in the area occupied by Germany, that is, anyport in the Channel or on the Atlantic seaboard.(ii) Some practical difficulties were involved, e.g., in connec-tion with arranging patrols for Contraband Controlpurposes. He proposed that these questions should beurgently considered by the Admiralty, in conjunctionwith the Ministry of Economic Warfare and with otherDepartments concerned,(iii) He proposed to accept the recommendations of the contraband Committee that goods for unoccupied france should be treated in exactly the same way asthose for the occupied territory, since the Germanarmistice terms made it perfectly plain that any goodspassing to Marseilles would, in effect, be under Germancontrol. France would be treated as being in effect, andas a whole, territory which was in the occupation ofor under the control of the enemy.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Italian armistice terms would probably affect the definitions of &apos;&apos; occupied &apos;&apos; and&apos;&apos; unoccupied &apos;&apos; France.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he found himself in general agreement with the manner in which the minister proposed to treat goods destined for France. Nevertheless, therewere obvious reasons for refraining, as far as possible, from givingpublicity at this stage to the action we were taking. He trustedthat nothing would be done under (iii) above which would causeany setback in our relations with Japan. We had enoughdifficulties in that quarter without creating fresh trouble. Forexample, the Committee might think fit to decide that we should refrain from seizing any cargoes shipped from Japan to unoccupied france earlier than the date of the French collapse, which mightbe defined as the date on which the French Government had informed the Germans that they were prepared to negotiate. Ifthe War Cabinet gave a general approval to the Minister&apos;sproposals, he would send the Minister a note in regard to this,and any other points to which he attached importance. these points /could then be settled interdepartmentally. This wasagreed to.The War Cabinet :-(i) Gave general approval to the proposals contained in w.P. (40) 221.(ii) Invited  the  Foreign  Secretary  and  the  Minister  for economic Warfare to settle interdepartmentally any points affecting their Departments, including thequestion of Japanese exports to France.Economic help from the americas.2.   The War Cabinet had before them : Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio,W.P. (40) 214.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,W.P. (40) 218.[21446a] b 2
The Minister without Portfolio said that on the assumptionthat we intended to press the United States Administration toextend to us all practicable help, and that the Administration wouldbe willing to do so, the measures which we should want them toadopt were those set out in paragraph 3 (1) to (4) of his Memo-randum. As regards paragraph 3 (5) he wished to substitute an expanded draft as a result of consultation with the Minister for economic Warfare. The problems involved in the conversion ofthe internal economy of the United States from a peace to a warbasis were so great that he thought it would be of value to sendan Economic Mission to the United States, provided that theAdministration were agreeable. We should work towards theestablishment of what would amount to a full economic alliance between the United States (and the Central and South american states), Canada, and ourselves. Thus world supplies of aluminiumwere so short that they could not be used to full advantage unless there was an agreed allocation between the United States, canada and ourselves.The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the War cabinet particulars of the rate at which we were incurring liabilities in dollars and other hard currencies, and indicated the period forwhich we should be able to continue such expenditure before our gold and other assets were exhausted. The United states ambassador took the view that we should be unwise to ask forfurther financial assistance at the present moment, since theAdministration knew that we still had certain assets at our disposal. When we had to obtain credits in the United States, weshould want credits from the United States Government, since weshould not be likely to secure large loans from the market on ourown credit. The proposal in paragraph (3) 2 of the Minister&apos;sMemorandum was important. The United States should realiseas soon as possible the magnitude of the effort which they must makeif their aid was to be of real value.The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs said that he was inagreement with the proposals of the Minister without Portfolio,provided that adequate discretion was left to Lord Lothian as tothe way in which the proposed communication should be made tothe United States Administration. Whether we could usefully send the Mission would depend on President Roosevelt&apos;s reaction.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that as soon as thenew Defence Bill had been passed, the Administration wouldpossess all necessary powers to control exports through licensing.The United States had, at our request, blocked the balances of thecountries which had been overrun by Germany, but they had so far been unwilling to block German or Italian balances.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should address a communication to His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Washington (a) Inviting him to make a communication to the UnitedStates Administration, in such a manner as he might consider most appropriate, on the lines ofparagraph 3 (1) to (5) of W.P. (40) 214 (Revise).(b) Inviting his observations on the suggestion that anEconomic Mission should be despatched to theUnited States.(2) Invited the Minister without Portfolio, in consultationwith the Ministers concerned, to prepare a draft of the telegram to be addressed to Lord Lothian under conclusion (1) above.
1 g gEvacuation 3.  on  President of the Council said that, at the from East Coast meeting referred to in the margin, the War Cabinet had remittedTowns. to a meeting of Ministers and Chiefs of Staff the question of the(Previous evacuation of the civil population from certain East Coast towns.Reference:        That meeting had authorised an investigation to be made by localW.M. (40) 138th authorities of the nineteen towns from which an evacuation of conclusions,      population was to be carried out, with a view to determining the minute 10.)       various categories of persons who should be evacuated or directed to remain.    This investigation was to be undertaken withoutprejudice to the ultimate decision whether such evacuation shouldtake place.It had been assumed that the Chiefs of Staff would tenderadvice as to the date when evacuation should start. If theoperation were to proceed smoothly, and if we were to avoid thedistressing experiences encountered in connection with the refugeesin France and Belgium, and the paralysing effect on militaryoperations of the blocking of roads by crowds of civilians, it was essential that evacuation should take place well in advance of an invasion.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff couldnot undertake to give the three days&apos; notice for which they had beenasked, nor could they fix a date before which invasion was unlikely.From the military point of view, chaos would result unless theoperation were carried out in advance of invasion. As it wasimpossible to predict when invasion was likely to be attempted, theChiefs of Staff would recommend that evacuation should take place as soon as possible.The Commander-in-Chief&apos;, Home Forces, confirmed that itwould be desirable, from the military point of view, to carry outevacuation forthwith.The Secretary of State for the Home Department said thatactive steps were being taken by the local authorities to classifythe classes of people who should be evacuated. In certain areas,however, it had been found that the numbers earmarked for removalwould amount to considerably more than 65 per cent, of the popula-tion; in some towns the percentage might be as high as 90 per cent.He understood that the area selected under the present scheme,which included towns on the East coast between Sheringham andFolkestone, had been chosen because this was the area most likelyto be attacked by an enemy seeking to capture London. If there was any idea of extending the scheme to the more populous cities and towns on the South coast, such as Brighton and Hove, the difficultiesof organising an evacuation would be immensely increased by theshortage of billets in reception areas.He (the Home Secretary) hoped that it would be possible to beready for evacuation the following Monday, but he could not givea firm undertaking that this would be the case until a full report had been received; this was expected to be available on the following-Thursday.In discussion, some anxiety was expressed as to the largeproportion of the population in these East Coast towns whichit was now proposed should be evacuated. In the first instance,this scheme had been limited to children, pregnant woman and old people and other bouches inuiiles.The Minister without Portfolio said that, in certain East coast towns, there were factory workers engaged on war production. Heinstanced Great Yarmouth, tie hoped that steps would be takento ensure that, in addition to personnel required for maintainingpublic utilities, police and fire brigade services, all workers engaged on war production remained at their posts[21446a] b 3
The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security said that the intention was to define the classesof people who were ordered to leave and that the Regional Com-missioners would exercise control over the local committees who were preparing lists of persons scheduled for evacuation. Some regardmust, however, be paid to local opinion, subject to the overridingneed for maintaining output for war industries. Any workers insuch industries who voluntarily left their posts would, of course,have no claim to the billeting and maintenance allowances whichwould have to be given to those whose evacuation was approved.The War Cabinet (1) Approved, in principle, that the evacuation of &apos;&apos; uselessmouths &quot; from the 19 East Coast towns betweenSheringham and Folkestone should start on the following monday, the 1st July, or as soon thereafter as possible.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to report to the War Cabineton the following Thursday (i) the date on which it would be possible to startevacuation;(ii) in general terms the classes and approximate numberof persons covered by the scheme.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to consider, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for War and the Ministerof Information, the form of the announcement to beissued to the public, when the time came for putting the scheme into operation.U.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 178thConclusions,Minute 10.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of the War Cabinet to telegrams No. 166 DEPP conveyingthe text of a personal message from the Prime Minister which itwas suggested that Sir Stafford Cripps should deliver to M. Stalin.His general instructions were that, if he were given &apos;an audienceby M. Stalin, he was to use the opportunity to explore the groundas thoroughly as possible.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Middle 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read out aEast. telegraphic report received by the War Office from General WavellEffect of recent on the nrst ten days&apos; fighting against the Italians in the Middlemilitarv East theatre.   This report brought out very clearly the superiorityoperations 0^ our troops and he wished to urge that, though such actions as hadbeen undertaken might not be very important from the strictly military point of view, their effect on opinion in the Middle east was of the utmost importance. He hoped, therefore, that this point would be made clear in the instructions given to General Wavell.The Secretary of State for War said that General Wavell hadalready been instructed to continue on the lines already begun andthat it had been made clear to him that successful operations onthese lines would be extremely valuable at the present time.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested thatGeneral wavell&apos;s report should be communicated to General Smuts.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of this statement.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toGeneral WaveiTs report to General Smuts.
Sweden.Seizure ofSwedishdestroyers.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 179thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said, that he had.seen the Swedish Minister on the previous evening and told him of the decision to return their destroyers. Without making it adefinite condition, he had made it plain that we expected theSwedish Government to do all that they could to transfer theirAmerican aircraft contracts to us, and the Swedish Minister had undertaken to do his utmost to persuade his Government to accept this proposal.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.JaPan- 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that we(Previous had not yet heard from Sir R. Craigie of any formal communicationReference: from the Japanese Government in regard to the three demandsW.M. (40) 178th which we were expecting thern to make of us (the closing of theConclusions, Hong Kong frontier, the removal of our troops from Shanghai, and minute 11.) the closing of the Burma-China frontier). The Hong Kong frontierwas already in effect closed by Japanese action, but a demand forthe closing of the Burma frontier would raise very difficult issues.The Secretary of State for War asked whether the foreign secretary was still opposed to the proposal that white women andchildren should be evacuated from Hong Kong. Apart from the direct military advantages, he suggested that action of this kind,showing that we meant to defend our interests in the Far East,would have a steadying effect on Japanese policy.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor War to consider this proposal again in the light ofthe latest developments, and to report oh it.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 178thConclusions,Minute 1.)bomber command.Synthetic oil plant at Leuna.coastal command.8. The Chief of the Air Staff said that during the previous day there had been little activity by enemy aircraft near this country.After dark, however, raids had taken place over a considerablearea of the country by some 50 to 70 aircraft. Bombs were reportedto have been dropped at a number of places in the Midlands, east anglia and at Bristol. The raids seemed to have been directed against our aerodromes and aero-engine factories, but no damageof any importance had been caused. Three persons had been killed and seven injured in Bristol where a brewery had been wrecked.Cloudy conditions had interfered with searchlight operations and no interceptions had been made by the fighters which had been set up. An unconfirmed report had been received that one enemybomber had come down.Attacks by 107 heavy bombers had been carried out againstaircraft factories and oil plants in North-Western Germany. all aircraft were reported to have returned.The attacks on aluminium plants carried out on the night ofthe 23rd-24th June appeared to have been most successful. AtKoln, 28 direct hits on the target had been observed.In reply to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff said that thehours of darkness were at present insufficient for attacks to becarried out on the synthetic oil plant at Leuna. The plant hadbeen bombed on one occasion, but owing to French susceptibilitiesno report had been made. The French aircraft which had bombedBerlin was also reported to have dropped bombs on Leuna.Two Coastal Command aircraft had failed to return fromreconnaissance flights to Stavanger and Trondhjem. An Anson onreconnaissance in the Channel had shot down a Messerschmitt.Mine-laying operations had been continued.
Air reinforce- The Chief of the Air Staff said that, owing to unfortunatements for the     circumstances, it appeared probable that a number of the aircraftMiddle East.     which had been despatched to reinforce the Middle East had been lost.  A Court of Enquiry into the matter was being held in Malta.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 178thConclusions,Minute 2.)Army training.9. The Prime Minister referred to the visit he was to make to one of the military commands on the following day. He believedthat large numbers of troops were still engaged on work which couldequally well be done by civilian labour. He had been told that only57,000 civilian workers were employed on work of a military nature.He hoped that full use was being made of the powers to requisitionlabour for digging trenches, &amp;c, and that the troops were employedon military training. Our object must be to train a fighting army as soon as possible. Parade drill played an important part in building up discipline and esprit de corps.The Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, agreed that drill was of great importance. With regard to the Prime Ministers visit,the command selected was composed entirely, as it happened, of territorial divisions. They were engaged in completing the coastalworks which they were required to man. The number of civiliansemployed would be doubled, if not trebled, in the ensuing week.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that divisions inthe forward area were on their action posts, and that at present itwas not easy to give them training, except one battalion at a time.As more holding battalions and home defence battalions wereformed, it would be possible to release greater numbers for training.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that aMemorandum had been widely circulated emphasising the need forinstilling the offensive spirit into all ranks. The morale of the army had inevitably suffered as a result of the series of retreats whichhad been forced upon them through no fault of their own, and everyeffort was being made to bring morale up to the highest possible level.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 178thConclusions,Minute 3.)Evacuation oftroops from France.Emile Bertinand Beam.Arrival of Polish and czech troops in thiscountry.10. The Chief of Naval Staff said that the Arandora Starwith 3,000 Polish Army and Air Force personnel, and a few Britishrefugees, and also the Ettrick with 1,100 British refugees and 300Poles, were on their way back under escort to the United Kingdom.Reports from Port Vendres had stated that there were 3,000Polish Troops awaiting evacuation and that the authorities were notallowing the evacuation of any French Forces.Reports had been received from H.M.S. Keppel that 3,000Czechs had been embarked from Cette and that no more ships were required.No further news had been received about the French shipsEmile Bertin and Beam except that Emile Bertin had passed southof Bermuda.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that Polish andCzech Troops were arriving in this country in large numbers andthat he would prepare a statement showing the numbers actuallylanded. Polish Troops appeared to be of good quality and wouldbe rearmed where necessary with rifles to be received from theUnited States. The Czech Troops were not of such high quality and would have to be carefully sorted out before rearming. Theultimate disposal of unsuitable elements might prove difficult.
The departure of two battalions of the French Foreign Legionhad been further delayed, and the precaution had been taken of keeping their ammunition under our control.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Prance. 11.   The Chief of Naval Staff asked whether steps should nowFrench oil De taken to destroy the oil stocks at Marseilles and in the Cette area,supplies. &apos;He        warned H.M.S.

In view of the negotiations beingcarried out in North Africa and of the important issues at stake,action against French territory by gunfire should be avoided at thisstage.The War Cabinet therefore decided against taking action at this stage to destroy oil stocks in the Marseilles andBordeaux areas.France.French shipping and shipping in french ports.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 179thConclusions,Minute 4.)12. The Chief of Naval Staff said that information had beenreceived of the presence at Le Verdon of an uncompleted Frenchtorpilleur which would be of considerable value to us and wouldcertainly be made use of by the Germans for coast protection duty.He asked for permission to include this vessel among those to be cut out that night.The War Cabinet took the view that this torpilleur mustbe treated as a unit of the French Fleet. It would therefore be subject to the decisions already madeconcerning units of the Fleet, and it should not be includedin the cutting-out operation.France. 13.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that aPosition in number of telegrams had  been received  from North AfricanFrench Colonial Territories, but they were conflicting and added little to our infor-territories. mation as to what was likely to happen there.The Secretary of State for War said that, according to atelegram received in the War Office, General Mittelhauser hadassembled all the senior officers of the Beirut garrison and had made it clear that under no circumstances would the flag be lowered, andthat he would accept no orders from the Bordeaux Government.His speech had been loudly applauded.
The Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, said if French Controlwere removed, and the officers left their regiments, the ForeignLegionaries and native troops in North Africa would break up intobands and the whole country would probably flare up into rebellion.It would then take years to clear up the position.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.15. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 416 DIPP fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid reporting that M. reynaud had been offered the post of Ambassador in Washington and thathe would probably accept it.The Foreign Secretary then read aloud a statement in whichthe Bordeaux Government presented the French case to the UnitedStates of America as follows : The Bordeaux Government, while admitting the plight inwhich France now found herself, emphasised its intention to restore the fortunes of the country by hard work. It regretted the criticalattitude adopted by the British Government and, in a survey ofevents, drew attention to British failure to mobilise men and resources and to despatch to France the full 26 Divisions that hadbeen promised. A delegation from the French press had visitedEngland and had reported on the unsatisfactory state of war production. It was obvious that Britain had believed more in theblockade than in the provision of material assistance to her Ally.The Prime Minister, when on his last visit to France, had been expected to attend a meeting of the Council, who had awaitedtwo hours for his arrival and, in the end, had been disappointed.The British Government had been asked what action they wouldtake if France found herself unable to continue the struggle andfelt obliged to ask for peace. In reply, the British Governmenthad expressed its intention of continuing the struggle but wouldnot reproach France for her default. Subsequently, due to inter-vention by M. Mandel and others, the British Government had adopted quite a different attitude.The Prime Minister said that this statement was false frombeginning to end. He indicated various points which he proposedto make in his speech in the Blouse of Commons that afternoon toexplain what had transpired between himself and M. Reynaud onhis last visit to France. He also proposed to explain that, in our future relations with the Bordeaux Government, we would takewhat action we thought necessary to ensure our own security andthe successful prosecution of the war.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.  -France.M.
