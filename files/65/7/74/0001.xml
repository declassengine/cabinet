1. The War Cabinet resumed consideration of this question,which had been deferred at the morning&apos;s Meeting.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the four Swedishdestroyers, when repaired, would be of considerable value to us for convoy purposes. The ships of the Swedish Navy that might fall into German hands were : 3- 11-in. Coastal Protection Vessels.1 -Modern 6-in. Cruiser.9 Destroyers.8 Submarines.On the previous day he had opposed a reversal of the decision onthe grounds that, first, the surrender of these ships would be inter-preted as a sign of weakness, particularly by those concerned intheir capture, and secondly, he had thought it unlikely that germany would deliver an ultimatum to Sweden in view of the effect thiswould have on the Russian attitude. The Naval Staff had, however,from the beginning taken the view that the value to us of thefour destroyers would be unlikely to compensate for the repercussions-sions following our action in seizing them. In view of the difficultiesanticipated by the Foreign Secretary, and his anxiety to avoidprovoking a German demarche to Sweden, the Admiralty wereprepared to see the destroyers released on the pretext that recent information from Sweden had thrown a fresh light on the whole matter. The Swedes should be asked to give an undertaking tothe British Government- that rather than allow these destroyers to fall into German hands they would cause them to be scuttled.The War Cabinet expressed general agreement with the view taken by the First Lord.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that if therelease of the destroyers were to be authorised, the swedish government would be informed that we were not taking this actionin reliance on German assurances of safe passage, and would therefore demand from Sweden the assurances suggested by theFirst Lord. We would explain that our decision had been madein the light of the new information furnished by the swedish government, which showed that they had believed that we hadbeen fully acquainted with the plan for ensuring that the shipsreached Sweden. In return for the destroyers, the swedish government should be pressed to suspend their contract for aircraft with the United States of America. He would try to make this a condition of their release and if successful, the transaction wouldbe considerably to our benefit.The Minister of Information asked if all mention of this incident should be kept out of the press.The Prime Minister said that there was nothing really unusualin holding ships pending investigation and that, in releasing thesedestroyers, it would be quite easy to say that enquiries had shownthat there were insufficient grounds for retaining them in view ofthe appeal made by the Swedish Government. There would be no need to make any public announcement, but our action could be explained to the officers and men concerned in the seizure of theships.The Chief of Naval Staff drew attention to the criticismcontained in telegrams from Stockholm of the action of the Swedishcaptain in allowing the destroyers to be seized by us. It mightsave this officer from punishment if, in our reply to the swedish government, reference was made to the fact that he had taken allthe steps he could to resist capture in the face of a very superiorforce.[21440b] b 2Sweden.Seizure ofSwedishdestroyers.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wouldmake that point quite clear.The War Cabinet (1) Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs totell the Swedish Government that, as a result of the freshinformation furnished by them, the destroyers would be released.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to use the release of these destroyers as a lever to obtain the suspension of the Swedish contract for aircraft from theUnited States of America.(3) Invited the Minister of Information to ensure that thismatter was not mentioned in the Press.France.Reply byPresidentLebrun to HisMajesty TheKing&apos;s Message.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the WarCabinet the reply whidh had been received from President Lebrunto The King&apos;s message.

(40) 178thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. After a short discussion, the War Cabinet agreed asfollows : (1) French shipping should not be allowed to sail from any british port.(2) All French ships on the high seas should be diverted into british ports.(3) Discretion should be given to the Naval authorities to allowFrench ships to sail in exceptional cases, provided thatthe Commanders of H.M. Ships were satisfied that the, vessels were in a position to complete their voyage insafety; for example, shipping might be allowed toproceed to Indo-China, where the loyalty of the localGovernment to the Allied cause was above suspicion.(4) Ships of any flag should be stopped from proceeding to german-occupied ports in France.(5) The expedition to Le Verdon to cut out merchant vessels should proceed, subject to the proviso that French ships should not be taken if within the three mile limit.There was, of course, no objection to such vessels beingseized if outside the three-mile limit.
France. 5.   The Secretary of State for War said that there were someArmed forces in 21,000 members of the French armed forces in this country. this the United figure included some 9,000 Naval personnel. The rest consistedKingdom. mainly of Chasseurs Alpins, and two battalions of the Foreign(Previous Legion.   The French Government at Bordeaux had ordered theirEef erence- Service personnel to return to France, and many of the men wereWM (40) 178th asking to be allowed to obey this order.Conclusions, Tn discussion it was suggested that it might be desirable that minute 8.) the Secretary of State for War should mention this matter toGeneral de Gaulle. Further, any really first-class troops, such asthe Foreign Legion, should, if possible, be induced to stay and fight for us, although the usefulness of these troops would be greatlydiminished if they did not volunteer as complete units. The restwere of no use to us, and had better be sent home at the first opportunity. They could not, of course, be permitted to take their equipment with them.As regards transport, they should sail in French ships.   Ifpossible ships should be sent from France to fetch them.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War to deal with thematter on the ab we general lines.France. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heFrench oil had been in communication with the Chancellor of the Duchy ofsupplies. Lancaster in regard to the oil installations in France which hadnot yet beeen destroyed.   The difficulties of effecting this were explained shortly.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chiefs of Staff to obtain from the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster the information in his possessionregarding the oil installations in France which had not yetbeen destroyed, and to report what action they recom-mended should be taken.Franco-Italian 7    jn ^he course of the Meeting a message was received toArmistice. the effect that a Franco-Italian armistice had been signed.  No newswas available as to its provisions.The War Cabinet took note of this information.France.Permits for french citizensto leave the united kingdom.8. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat he had that morning taken steps to suspend the issue to Frenchcitizens of permits to leave this country. He did not propose tomake exceptions in favour of members of the various french military Missions or the French Purchasing Missions now in thiscountry.The War Cabinet approved the course proposed.France.communication of information to theDominions.9. The view was expressed that it would be premature tomake any communication at this stage to the Dominion governments as to the position of Anglo-French relations.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointed out thatCanadian and South African representatives were accredited tothe French Government. France also had representatives in canada and South Africa.   For this reason it was most necessary that
these two Dominions should be given early information if any breach of diplomatic relations was about to take place between thiscountry and France.The Prime Minister said that he had received a cordial telegramfrom Mr. Mackenzie King, referring among other matters, to thepossibility that the British Fleet might be sent to North Americaif the situation deteriorated.The Prime Minister read his draft reply, in which he expressed his confidence as to the final outcome of the war and that there wasno reason to fear chat the Royal Navy would have to be transferredto American waters.The War Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to telegraph to Mr. mackenzie king on the lines suggested.Telegram toMr. mackenzie king.France. 10.

Corbin had been unwilling to charge himself with delivering it.

APPENDIX.Communication from the French Government.(Minute 10.)M. CAMBON called this afternoon to make the following communicationson behalf of the French Government. He explained, in confidence, that M. Corbin,who was unlikely to remain Ambassador much longer, was unwilling to chargehimself with these communications, and had commissioned M. Cambon to deliverthem. M. Cambon doubted whether, if there were many such communications to make, he would be able to continue to come to us with them.1. The French Government wished to point out that General de gaulle had been recalled to France for disciplinary reasons. In view of this fact, theaction of His Majesty&apos;s Government in permitting the services of the B.B.C.to be placed at General de Gaulle&apos;s disposal for an appeal to the public overthe head of the French Government was quite irregular, and had created amost painful impression in France.2. The French Government had been informed that His Majesty&apos;s consular representatives at Rabat, Algiers and Tunis, on instructions from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, had made communication to the effect that, France having been obliged to sign an armistice, the French Government no longer had any powers in territory occupied by the enemy, and, consequently, His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment appealed to all French territories overseas to abandon the French Govern-ment and to continue the struggle with Great Britain. (I told M. Cambon thatI did not think this was an accurate summary. He suggested that we mightpoint this out in any reply we made.) The French Government wished to saythat they thought that these communications were quite inadmissible, and seemedto show that His Majesty&apos;s Government intended not to continue their relationswith the French Government. The French Government could not believe thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would assume such a responsibility, and they askedLord Halifax to let them have an expression of his opinion on this subject.3. In view of the above, the French Government asked that the Consuls-General at Rabat, Tunis and Algiers should be recalled. (M. Cambon suggestedthat one solution might be to let them go on leave.)4. Finally, M. Cambon said that the French Government wished to make certain observations upon recent statements by the Prime Minister. These had created a very painful impression in France, and the French Government felt bound to protest against certain statements which were in complete conflict withthe facts. The situation had been clearly explained to the Prime Minister onthe 11th June.The French Government had been compelled to withdraw from the struggleby circumstances which were well-known in London, and the French Govern-ment had never for a moment lost sight of the bonds which united them to HisMajesty&apos;s Government. Their main preoccupation was not to agree to any condi-tion which would be likely to make France, or any aspect of French activity,an instrument Which might be directly used against Great Britain. In the viewof the French Government none of the clauses of the Armistice implied thatthis preoccupation had been set aside. In particular, the French government thought it certain that the French Fleet could not in any event be used against great Britain. Formal assurances to this effect had been given on several occasions to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador. The President of the Council and theMinistry for Foreign Affairs had renewed these assurances a few days ago toLord Lloyd and Mr. Alexander.The attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the remarks of the PrimeMinister, had given the impression that the solemn declarations of the FrenchGovernment had not been received in London with the complete confidence whichthey deserved. Whatever difficulties might be caused by the present situationin France, these difficulties ought not to be allowed to break the moral andpolitical front which the two Governments had maintained hitherto. The FrenchGovernment were firmly convinced of this, and it was in this sense they would continue to influence public opinion in France.   If the terms used by the Prime
Minister were any guide, the Prime Minister seemed to regard the present Frenchgovernment as not accurately representing French public opinion, or as repre-senting only part of it. It was important to emphasise that there was no&quot; Government of Bordeaux.&quot; There was only the Government of France, whichinterpreted the feelings of Frenchmen and was fully supported by them. TheFrench Government hoped, more particularly, that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould see to it that the departure of Sir R. Campbell and the staff of theBritish Embassy should not be wrongly interpreted.I told M. Cambon that I would report what he had said, and would abstain from any comment on his representations.Speaking personally, M. Cambon warned us not to overlook the passage inthe foregoing communication about the desire of the French Government notto break the common front. Unless this point was properly dealt with in anyreply we sent, the French Government were quite likely to pretend that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had rejected the hand of friendship offered by the FrenchGovernment.He said, further, that he hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not say anything which made it necessary for the French Government to recall the embassy from London. This Embassy was the.sole link now existing betweenthe two Governments, and it would be disastrous if that link were broken. Itwas important to gain time. The French Government were in a curious stateof mind at the moment. In a few weeks&apos; time, when the French people had further experience of German occupation, it might be possible to do somethingwith them.W. STRANGJune 24, 1940.
