The western front.Despatch ofFighterAircraft toFrance.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 124thConclusions,Minute 1.)The War Cabinet were informed that, according to reports received from various sources, the situation in France appeared tobe less critical than it had been in the afternoon.The War Cabinet then discussed a message received from thePrime Minister in Paris (Paris telegram No. 206, DIPP), in whichhe urged that 6 more squadrons of fighters should be sent to france in addition to the 4 already promised in answer to the last Frenchrequest, and that a larger part of our heavy bombers should beemployed on the following nights upon the German masses crossing the Meuse into the bulge in the French line. They were informedthat of the 4 squadrons already promised 2 had left during theday and the other 2 were leaving at dawn. If 6 more were sent,we should be down to 29 squadrons in all in the United Kingdom.Everything was being done to make up fighter aircraft receivedfrom production with the necessary accessories, which were beingstripped from aircraft which had been damaged in action.The Chief of the Air Staff said that there would be no difficultyin putting heavy bombers on to the Meuse crossings. The provisionof the additional fighter squadrons was more difficult. We had atpresent 7 fighter squadrons operating in the north of France and3 in the south, but the latter had moved- their bases and were some-what disorganised. The bases in the north could not receive 6 moresquadrons; 3 was the most they could take. There remained in theUnited Kingdom at the present time only 6 complete Hurricanesquadrons. He proposed to move all these down to aerodromes in kent, and to send servicing parties over to the aerodromes innorthern France used by the Air Component. Three of the 6squadrons to be sent to Kent would, work in France from dawnuntil noon, and then return to Kent, being relieved by the other3 for the afternoon. The effect would be the same as if the wholeof the 6 squadrons were sent to work from French aerodromes, butthey would be in less danger of attack on the ground in Kent andthe crews would have better facilities for rest. The timings of the move would have to be worked out, and it would not be possible toget them all down to Kent to-morrow, since some squadrons wouldhave to move in from distant parts.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that, excluding the4 squadrons promised to the French in the morning, we had already10 fighter squadrons operating in France. By sending 6 moresquadrons in addition to the 4 promised this morning we should bedoubling our present strength of fighters in France. The totalnumber of fighter squadrons to operate over the Bulge would haveto be settled by the Air Officer Commanding-in-chief. Some fighter squadrons would have to be kept in the B.E.F. area, but there wasno technical reason why the Kent squadrons should not operate overthe Bulge after refuelling and re-arming at the aerodromes in thenorth. Alternatively they might take the place of some of thefighters already based on the northern aerodromes.The War Cabinet (i) Instructed the Chief of the Air Staff-(a) To put in hand immediate arrangements, on thelines which he had proposed, for making available6 Hurricane squadrons for operations in france as early as possible.(b) To arrange for heavy bombers to attack the Meusecrossings on the night 17th-18th May, andfollowing nights.
(ii) Instructed the Secretary to arrange for this decision to betelephoned forthwith to Paris and confirmed by telegram in the terms agreed at the meeting.** Copy attached to these Conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May    , 1940.ANNEX.Arranging for Bombers as you propose. Will make the sixadditional fighter squadrons available with all speed for operations in France. C.A.S. will telephone detailed times and arrangementsearly to-morrow, Friday.
