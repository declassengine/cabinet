The Air 1.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that, owing to bad weather,Situation. there had been very little air activity on either side.   An enemy(Previous aircraft had been plotted  proceeding  towards  Ireland.    this reference: brought the total of German aircraft believed to have been flownW.M. (40) 168th to Ireland to six. The Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsConclusions, said that Mr. de Valera was kept fully informed of these GermanMinute 7.)        activities.Middle East. Some further Italian petrol dumps had been destroyed in air operations in the Middle East.More raids had been carried out on Malta, but no casualties or damage had been reported.British Air The British Air Forces in the South of France had been&quot;Force in France, ordered to evacuate. The aircraft could be flown back to thiscountry. The more formidable question was the evacuation of some,500 maintenance personnel with a number of A.A. guns. air marshal Barratt had been instructed to concert the best means of evacuation with the Senior Naval Officer. The alternatives were from Toulon to North Africa or from Bordeaux.The Chief of Naval Staff said that evacuation from Toulonwould require six destroyers to escort the transports. The onlyships available were patrolling the Straits of Gibraltar.The Prime Minister was reluctant to see the plans for con-tinuing air attack on North Italy abandoned and thought that orders for evacuating the Air Force from the South of france should be held up until the matter had been investigated further.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Note. Later in the meeting, when the news was received thatthe French Armies had ceased fire, the Secretary of Statefor Air was authorised to proceed with the evacuation ofthe British Air Forces from the South of France.The MilitarySituation.The western front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 168thConclusions,Minute 9.)2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that GeneralBrooke was now at Redon. Evacuation had been started fromNantes and Cherbourg. 51,000 men had been withdrawn from thelines of communication and 6,500 from Cherbourg. Some 50,000remained to be withdrawn.General Marshall-Cornwall had been ordered to hold on withthe French 10th Army at all costs. His force now comprised theBeauman force, one infantry brigade of 52nd Division, one armoured brigade (strength reduced to about one regiment), a totalof about 5,000 men. He was falling back on his lines of communi-cation to Cherbourg. The War Office were not in communicationwith General Marshall-Cornwall, but General Brooke had reportedthat the French 10th Army were disintegrating. One battalionwith anti-tank guns was covering the Cherbourg Peninsula.There was general agreement that, now that the FrenchGovernment under Marshal Petain were suing for an armistice,we would be sacrificing our men to no purpose if we told them tofight on. The French would no doubt reproach us for evacuatingour troops while fighting was still in progress, but further sacrificewould serve no useful purpose and would not prevent the french from blaming us in any case.There was some discussion whether General Brooke should remain in France, either at Nantes or Cherbourg, or return to thiscountry.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, felt that no useful purpose would be served by General Brooke &apos;s remaining in France.The Prime Minister hoped that the War Office would not recallGeneral Brooke so long as his presence in France could be of value to the difficult withdrawal with which our troops were faced.[21425] b 2
The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 168thConclusions,Minute 8.)Arrival of australian andNew Zealandconvoy.Attacks on trade.Enemy miningactivities.3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had met theAustralian and New Zealand troop convoy on its arrival in the clyde on the previous afternoon and had found the troops in very good heart. He had also had some talk with the party of naval ratings who had arrived with the convoy, including a considerableNew Zealand contingent, and had met the officers of the Canadiandestroyers who had formed part of the escort on the last stages ofthe voyage.The Chief of Naval Staff said that the Empress of Australiahad arrived at Reykjavik with 1,000 Canadian troops.The Prench aircraft carrier Beam and the cruiser Jeanne d&apos;Archad sailed from Halifax early on the previous day. So far as was known, they were intending to make for North African ports orfor Marseilles.The following losses by enemy submarine attacks had occurred on the previous day :  S.S.   Wellington  Star  (11,400   tons)   torpedoed   about500 miles west of Vigo;Norwegian Tanker James Stove (8,215 tons); and norwegian ship Bralanta (9,608 tons) sunk by submarine off Aden.The entrances to the Loire and St. Nazaire were open todemagnetised ships. Caen was closed and the Gironde, Portland,Weymouth and Brest were temporarily closed. We had to providethe ships and gear for the sweeping up of magnetic mines in French ports.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.France.Formationof new government.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 434 from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Bordeaux, which had been received at-50 a.m. that morning, reporting that the chief members of thenew French Government./&apos; following on the resignation ofM. Reynaud, were as follows :  M. Chautemps : Vice-President of the Council.General Weygand : Minister of National Defence.General Colsom : Minister for War.Admiral Darlan : Minister of Marine.General Pujot: Minister for Air.M. Bauclouin : Minister for Foreign Affairs.M. Bouthillier : Minister of Finance.M. Pomaret: Minister of Interior.M. Frossard : Minister of Public Works.It would be noticed that M. Flandin, M. Laval, and M. Bonne^were not included.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed that General Marshall-Cornwall should be toldforthwith to withdraw his force to the coast.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to give furtherconsideration to the question whether General Brookeshould now be recalled, in the light of the views expressed by the Prime Minister.
495 W.M. 170 (40).He also referred to telegram No. 435 DIPP reporting a con-versation between Sir R. Campbell and Admiral Darlan in regardto the French fleet, during which the latter had said : &quot;So long asI can issue orders to it you have nothing to fear.&quot;He had telegraphed to our Ambassadors at Washington andMadrid in order to keep them in touch with the situation.The Prime Minister said that he had had a telephone conversa-tion with General Spears, who was returning to England, as he didnot think he could perform any useful service in the presentsituation. General de Gaulle was also coming back with him, as hehad apparently been warned that, as things were developing, itmight be as well for him to leave France.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that, according to an american broadcast service from Berlin, the German Governmentwould not make any armistice with the French Government, but would proceed to destroy or put out of action all their armed forces.In further discussion, it was pointed out that, so far as sir R. Campbells telegrams showed, our only communication withthe French Government had been Sir R. Campbells interview withM. Baudouin (reported in telegram No. 433).Reference was made to the telegram which had been despatched to M. Reynaud on the previous day (No. 368 DIPP), in which itwas stated that the sailing of the French Fleet for British harbourswas a condition of our assenting to the French enquiring as to theterms of an armistice for France. This telegram had been delivered to M. Reynaud, but he had then been asked to suspend action on it,and it was not certain whether he had shown it to the other membersof the French Government. Sir R. Campbell had therefore been instructed to deliver the telegram to Marshal Petain.The Prime Minister suggested that a further telegram shouldbe sent, pointing out that, if the French Government sought an armistice without fulfilling this condition, our consent would not be forthcoming.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to send atelegram in this sense.Evacuation of 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theBelgian Military Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs had told our Charge d&apos;AffairesPersonnel.        that the Belgian Government wished to be entirely associated withHis Majesty&apos;s Government.   He had asked if facilities could begiven for the evacuation of some 900 Belgian Officers and 30 to 35thousand troops, including 7,000 at Brest.The Prime Minister suggested that a reply should be sent tothe Belgians as follows : (1) Their troops should be told to proceed to the ports, andwe would do our best to continue evacuation as long aspossible.(2) They should be informed as to the ports from which theycould most conveniently be taken off.(The Admiralty would advise the Foreign Office onthis point.)(3) The Belgians should be asked to inform us as early aspossible as to the number of their troops likely to reacheach port.The War Cabinet invited the Foreign Secretary to reply tothe Belgian Government on the above lines.British consent to the Frenchseeking an armistice.
6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad no information of importance about the Russian designs inthe Baltic States. It was clear that there had been a considerableextension of the Russian sphere of influence in Lithuania, and theyseemed to have similar designs with regard to Estonia. He hadno information of the rumours that Russia was concentrating forces for an attack on Bessarabia.There could be little doubt that the intention behind Russia&apos;smoves was to strengthen her position against Germany, whosemilitary successes were not to her liking.Eoumania. The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Egypt. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his(Previous colleagues would now have seen his telegram of the previous eveningReference:        (No. 468 DIPP to Cairo) in which he had authorised Sir miles.M. (40) 166th Lampson to tell King Parouk that in time of war the worst policyConclusions,      was one 0$ uncertainty, and that the vacillation of Ali Maher was minute 9.) &apos;      nQf in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty, nor representativeof the feelings of the Egyptian people, nor conducive to Egypt&apos;sultimate interests.  It was, therefore, necessary for another Govern-ment to be formed, under another Prime Minister.He regretted that there had not been time to consult the WarCabinet before this telegram was despatched, but he had had no alternative but to take action quickly. He had received reports which had convinced him that the general situation in that country had been going from bad to worse. It remained to be seen howKing Farouk would receive this message. On the whole he thoughtthat the King might be expected to come into line, although he might at first give a certain amount of trouble. One satisfactoryfeature in the situation was the improved attitude of Nahas Pashaand the Wafd.   No serious difficulties were expected with them.The War Cabinet took note with approval of the above statement.U.S.S.R.Action in theBaltic States.(previous erence:W.M. (39) 31stConclusions,Minute 3.)Rumours ofconcentrationJapan.Relations withthe U.S.A.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 38thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs drew theattention of the War Cabinet to Tokyo telegram No. 996, dated the13th June. This telegram showed that the United states ambassador in Tokyo had been urging on his Government thedesirability of not allowing American and Japanese relations tocrystallise into a state of deadlock. Mr. Grew had recently had an interview with the Japanese Foreign Minister and it appeared thata measure of improvement in the relations between the two Govern-ments had resulted.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Defence againstInvasion.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 164thConclusions,Minute 12.)State of readiness-ness of theArmy and theLocal defence volunteers.9. In view of the probability that within the next few weeksthis country would be faced with an attempted German invasion,whether on a larger or a smaller scale, a discussion took place onthe state of readiness of the British Army and of the Local defence volunteers. The principal points which were raised were asfollows : 
Strength of the (1) The strength of the Army was much greater than wasArmy. commonly   realised.     We   now   had   approximately-1 million men under arms in this country. There weredeficiencies in their offensive equipment, but all of them had rifles. It was desirable to give publicity to this fact, which ought both to hearten our own people andto give the Germans food for reflection.The Secretary of State for War undertook to check these facts and figures in order that the Prime Minister might include some reference to them in his speech in the House of Commons on thefollowing day.(2) Our forces in the United Kingdom would shortly be strengthened by the return of the remainder of theB.E.P., and by the arrival of our Regular battalionsfrom India, and of reinforcements from Canada and australia.(3) Voluntary enlistment into the Army was continuing on aconsiderable scale, above the age groups which were liable for compulsory military service. There was nothing to prevent a fit man between the ages of 30 and50 from volunteering, and about 1,000 a day were doing so. Thus, of the intake into the Army during the lastmonth, which had been about 165,000, about 30,000 hadbeen volunteers.(4) Our forces at home were being organised, drilled, trained and equipped as rapidly as possible; and from now onwards they would be permeated with a leaven of menwho had seen active service. Nevertheless, some seriousdefects in the Army had now come to light.(a) There was a shortage of good officers. Many of theTerritorial officers who had joined in peace-time were not really suitable men.The Prime Minister strongly urged the selection and rapid promotion of men who had made their mark in action.(&amp;) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theretreats and withdrawals which we had recentlybeen compelled to carry out must necessarily have left their mark on the psychology of our troops.We must once and for all cast behind us the spiritof &quot;looking over one shoulder,&quot; and of looking for a position to fall back on.(c) We had always in the past aimed at training our whole Army to reach a uniformly high level. this method had on occasions resulted in a certain lackof enterprise among the rank and file. This was rather marked at the present time. The Germans,on the other hand, had even in the last war madea distinction between the Storm Troops who led the way and the dull solid mass who consolidatedthe position after the Storm Troopers had wonit. In the present war this differentiation hadbeen much more marked in the German Army.The young Nazi hot-heads who filled the armoured divisions had suffered very heavy losses, but hadbeen responsible for a shattering series of Germanvictories. We should have to take a leaf out ofthe Germans&apos; book and to organise specialsquadrons of Storm Troopers (see also at (7)below).
(5) There had been a good deal of criticism both in the press and among Members of Parliament of the lack ofThe Local organisation and discipline among the L.D.V&apos;s.   It wasDefence no doubt difficult to reach a very high standard with menVolunteers. who gave part-time service only, on an unpaid basis.On the other hand, the L.D.V&apos;s. were now some 500,000strong and most of them were very keen.There was also a very widespread demand from menof all ages to be allowed to serve in the armed forces or at least to be given weapons in order to defend their homes.   This demand could not be ignored.The Secretary of State for War described certain steps whichhe was taking to meet this situation. The organisation of theL.D.V&apos;s. had now become too heavy a task to impose on the existingstaffs of the Home Defence Forces. It was proposed to reorganisethem under separate Central and Local Commanders of their own.The whole organisation would, however, remain under the orders ofGeneral Ironside. In order to assist in training, full-timepermanent instructors would be taken on. Further assistance intraining would be given by drawing on the Officers&apos; EmergencyReserve. (This had originally consisted of 11,000 ex-Officers, ofwhom some 3,000 had not yet been found posts.)(6) The Secretary of State said that the L.D.V&apos;s. were at themoment largely a &quot;broomstick&quot; Army. Rifles werebeing provided for them as quickly as possible. &quot;We hada supply of rifles which had been kept in store sincethe last war, and which were now being reconditioned.Another 500,000 rifles were ready to leave the UnitedStates. According to the original intention, these wouldhave been divided equally between this country andFrance, but arrangements were now being made whichwould ensure that the whole consignment came to us.The Prime Minister emphasised the importance of getting theserifles shipped at the earliest possible moment. Nothing must beleft undone to get these rifles as quickly as possible.(7) Steps were also being taken to organise sections of StormTroopers on a full-time basis, as part of the L.D.V&apos;s.Tough and determined characters would be selected.Some of these would be armed with &quot; Tommy &quot; guns.Some 2,000 of these weapons were on order, of which some 200 had already arrived.The Press. (8) The press were no doubt doing their best to keep up thepublic morale, and to a great extent they were succeeding.The mass of our population remained remarkablycheerful under adversity. But the press could notrefrain from indulging in one &quot; stunt&quot; after another.These stunts sometimes created a lack of confidence.Again, even the most reputable newspapers treated the guidance which they were given in a rather cavalierspirit. In tJhe last resort the only remedy in the handsof the Government was to order prosecutions, and it seemed undesirable to adopt this remedy at the present justice.The War Cabinet :-(1) Approved generally the steps proposed by the Secretary ofState for War for the re-organisation and training ofthe L.D.V&apos;s.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to take action onthe following lines to improve the training and to instilan offensive spirit into the Army        whole :Rifles from theUnited States ofAmerica.
(a) The Storm Troop element should be introduced intothe Army.(b) All leaders who should prove themselves lackingin drive and initiation should be rutJhlesslyeliminated and replaced by others who had shown themselves active and ardent spirits in battle.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for War, in conjunction withthe Minister of Supply, to take all possible steps to expedite the supply of rifles, automatic weapons andammunition from the United States, and to report theposition as soon as possible.French request for an armistice.Our require-ments from theFrench.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 168thConclusions,Minute 1.)French colonial empire andMandatedTerritories.[21425]10. The War Cabinet had before them an Aide-Memoireprepared by the Chiefs of Staff in consultation with the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C.O.S. (40) 466).The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster pointed out that thepaper was a policy of perfection, but it was hoped that we mightbe able to obtain some of our requirements. The difficulties were very considerable owing to the state of disorganisation in France.Nevertheless, consignments of machine tools and the German pilotprisoners were arriving at the ports, and everything possible wasbeing done to get them away. It was hoped to evacuate 250 tonsof Belgian gold now at Bordeaux. A somewhat disturbing piece of news had just come in, to the effect that one of our demolitionparties at Dinard had been prevented by the French from carryingout their task. If this was done on orders from above, it would besymptomatic of the policy of the new French Government. if France made terms with the enemy, we must expect that largequantities of oil would fall into German hands.Some discussion followed on what steps could be taken to implement the recommendations in the Aide-Memoire, which hadbeen originally prepared with a view to its discussion by a british delegation with the French Government. It was recognised thatthe security of the French Fleet was the most important item. Theinclusion of Admiral Darlan in the new Government was perhaps a hopeful sign.The War Cabinet then considered a further Report by theChiefs of Staff relating to the French Colonial Empire and mandated Territories (W.P. (40) 207), and a Memorandum by theMinister of Economic Warfare (W.P. (G.) (40) 156).The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, if the Frenchcollapsed altogether, there was the possibility that the germans would take over the French West African troops and employ themto attack our West African Colonies by land.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs supported the view expressed by the Minister of Economic Warfare in his Memo-randum, that economic inducements might be offered to the Frenchadministrative officers in the Colonies in order &apos; to obtain their co-operation. Such co-operation was most important, and it wouldbe worth offering substantial amounts if necessary. We could notrely on the French Government sending a secret message to theirColonial authorities urging them to continue the struggle. he asked the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to consider this possibility.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the Aide-Memoire of the Chiefs of Staff (C.O.S.(40) 466).(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster toproceed, in collaboration with the other ministers concerned, with his arrangements to oarry out, so farc
as possible, the recommendations contained in the Aide-Memoire, and to report what further action, if any,could be taken to obtain our requirements from theFrench.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tocommunicate to Sir Ronald Campbell the more important points in the Chiefs of Staff Aide-Memoire.(4) Approved the Report of the Chiefs of Staff on the actionwhich should be taken in respect of the French colonial empire and Mandated Territories (W.P. (40) 207).Evacuation of 11.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChildren from Minister of Home Security covering the Report of an Interdepart-Great Britain mental Committee under the Chairmanship of the ParliamentaryOverseas. Under-Secretary of State, Dominions Office, on the arrangementsfor enabling children to be sent to places of greater safety overseas(W.P. (G.) (40) 152).The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security explained that the Report of the Committee, forwhich he and his colleagues were greatly indebted to Mr. Shake-speare, set out a plan for organising the evacuation of school children to the Dominions and to the United States of America. Many offersto take children for the duration of the war had been received fromthe overseas Dominions with the approval of the Governmentsconcerned, and similar offers had been received from privateorganisations in the United States of America. The action to betaken was set out on pages 10 and 11 of the Report, which, if theWar Cabinet approved, should be brought into operation forthwith.The Minister without Portfolio said that, while it was nodoubt repugnant to wide sections of public opinion to break uphomes in this way, he recognised that, if this country were tobecome an &quot; island fortress,&quot; it would be desirable to have fewermouths to feed.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs supported theproposals, the success of which would depend upon the work of theproposed Children&apos;s Overseas Reception Board, who would be theexecutive committee for the scheme.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Dominions Office,said that the Report had been drafted in a form suitable for publication. If the War Cabinet approved the proposals, it was intended to announce the scheme in Parliament in reply to aquestion on the following Wednesday.The War Cabinet (a) Approved the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee set out in the Report circulated with.P. (G.) (40) 152.(6) Agreed that the scheme should be announced in answer toa Parliamentary question the following Wednesday, andthat thereafter the Report of the Committee should bepublished.French 12.   At this point in the Meeting a message was brought inProposals for an reporting that the French troops had ceased fire at 12 - 40, andArmistice.        giving an account of Marshal Petain&apos;s speech on the wireless at12 Noon.  The Marshal was reported as having said  &apos;&apos; It is with a broken heart that I tell you to-day thatfighting must cease.  I addressed myself last night to the enemy,
3c 3to ask him if he is prepared to seek with me, as between soldiersafter an honourable fight, the means of putting an end tohostilities.&quot;Prime Minister&apos;sStatement inParliament.SuggestedBroadcasting.13. The Minister of Information raised the question whetherthe Prime Minister&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on Tuesday,the 18th June, should be broadcast.Before this could be done, it would be necessary that aResolution should be passed by the House agreeing to the course proposed.It was pointed out that the Speaker had been closely associatedwith the previous discussions which had taken place between theLeaders of the Political Parties in regard to the broadcasting of proceedings of the House, and it would clearly be necessary that the speaker should be consulted before any arrangements were made for broadcasting the speech.If arrangements were made for the speech to be broadcast, itwas suggested that the House of Lords should not meet until afterthe Prime Minister&apos;s speech had been delivered.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Information to consult the speaker in regard to the proposal that the Prime Minister&apos;sspeech in the House of Commons on the following day should be broadcast.Note. It was eventually decided not to adopt this suggestion.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 17, 1940.
