Secret Session.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 163rdConclusions,Minute 8.)After a short discussion, the War Cabinet agreed That arrangements should be made for the postponed secret session to be held on Thursday, the 20th June, in bothHouses of Parliament.Use of Belgian 2.   The   Minister   without   Portfolio   said   that   telegramand French No. 387 DIPP from our Ambassador in Prance showed that the skilled Labour French were evacuating machine-tools from the Paris region asin this Country, quickly as possible. Matters were moving rapidly, and it was clear(Previous that any action on our part must be taken at once if it was to be reference: effective.W.M. (40) 162nd As arranged at the meeting of the War Cabinet on the previousConclusions, day, an inter-Departmental Conference had been held that morning.Minute 9.) So far as concerned Belgian skilled labour, the Minister of aircraft production had given precise details and was asking for 600 skilled workers. The Minister of Supply hoped to be able to give detailslater in the day. He (the Minister without Portfolio) asked forimmediate authority to telegraph to France, saying that we wereprepared to take a limited number of skilled workers of specifiedtypes, and also machine-tools. If this was done at once, further details could be telegraphed later.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster strongly supported this suggestion.The Minister of Home Security said that it was important thatthe categories of skilled workers should be clearly specified, andthat the French should be asked to make as effective as possibletheir scrutiny of these men before they left France. It was clearthat such scrutiny as could be carried out on this side could notbe wholly effective, and a certain security risk was thus involved.The Minister without Portfolio said that the Belgian trades union had undertaken to assist in this scrutiny.The War Cabinet Authorised the Minister without Portfolio in conjunctionwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (a) To arrange for the immediate despatch of a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in France saying thatwe were prepared to receive in this country a limited number of Belgian skilled workers of specified types,and also spare machine-tools.(b) To arrange that the detailed requirements of theMinister of Supply and the Minister of aircraft production in regard to skilled workers and machine-tools should be communicated to france as soon as possible; specifying in each case types and numbers.Visit to France 3.   The Lord President of the Council said that the Primeof the Prime Minister had received a message from France late on the previousMinister and night. It would be remembered that M. Reynaud had given athe Secretary of specific undertaking that, if any new phase in the situation should state for intervene  calling  for  an   important  decision  by  the   french foreign Affairs.  Government, they would give us an opportunity of consultationbefore any final decisions were reached.    The Prime Minister,accompanied by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, had[21411a] b 2
accordingly left by aeroplane that morning. The Prime Ministerhoped that he would be able to return that evening, in which eventthere would probably be a further Meeting of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 163rdConclusions,Minute 1.)fighter command.Enemy activity.bomber command.4. The Chief of the Air Staff said that 181 Hurricane sortieshad been carried out the previous day over Normandy but no enemy aircraft had been seen.British AirForce inFrance.Attacks onNorwegiancoast.Middle East.Some air raid warnings had been issued the previous night onaccount of enemy aircraft. One aircraft had approachedPortsmouth, where it was engaged by anti-aircraft fire.Forty-eight Blenheim sorties had been made, mostly over thearea south of the Seine near Les Andelys, where the woods and enemy columns had been attacked. Three Blenheims had been lost in these operations.Thirty-two heavy bombers had attacked targets on the Germancommunications in France, and 5 aircraft had laid mines at thesouthern end of the Little Belt. One of our aircraft fouled a ballooncable at Harwich on its return and was wrecked. There were noother casualties.Further information had been received concerning bomberoperations on the night 11th/12th June. The attack on the woodsin the Fumay-Hirson area appeared to be most successful. Manyfires were started and explosions observed. Many hits on road and rail junctions and marshalling yards had been obtained. A seriesof explosions followed an attack made at Ligramont. The gasworksat Cologne had been hit.Of the 36 Whitley aircraft which had been directed againstNorthern Italy, only one had now failed to return. 21 of theaircraft had dropped their bombs.Reports of operations by the British Air Force in France onthe 11th June showed that numerous bomber sorties had been made against German communications in the vicinity of the lower Seine;fighter patrols had also been carried out. No enemy aircraft hadbeen encountered in these Operations. Details of the previous day&apos;operations by the British Air Force in France were not yet available,other than a report that one Hurricane patrol had shot down thewhole of an enemy formation of 5 aircraft.Attacks had been made by Coastal Command aircraft and fleet air Arm Skuas on Bergen and Trondhjem; also the aerodrome atVaernes, near Trondhjem.The First Sea Lord said that the attack by the Skuas on theships at Trondhjem had been made early that morning. The R.A.F.aircraft had co-operated by bombing the aerodrome to keep down the enemy fighters and to escort the Skuas back. The Commander-in-Chief had decided not to send in the Swordfish torpedo bombers.From reports received the Skuas had scored one hit on a battle-cruiser, but had suffered considerable casualties from anti-aircraft fire.The Chief of the Air Staff said that aircraft operating fromAden had dropped 4 tons of bombs on Assab and done considerable damage. Two Italian fighters had tried to intercept them, without success. No anti-aircraft fire had been encountered. Three tonsof bombs had been dropped on Diredawa, where an ammunition
445 W.M. 164(40).dump had been hit. No fighters but slight anti-aircraft fire Kad been met. There had been a light enemy raid on Aden, which had doneno damage.A squadron from Egypt bad again attacked El Adam success-fully. Thirty-six Blenheims had also attacked the harbour atTobruk. They had met with considerable opposition, but one largeship had been set on fire and was seen to have been beached. Thenaval pier with another ship alongside was also seen to be burning.Aircraft from the Sudan had attacked and hit fuel storage and hangars at Massawa. They bad encountered considerable anti-aircraft fire.South African aircraft operating from Kenya had bombedMoyale without opposition, and scored hits on transport lines.The latest information about the raids on Malta on the11th June showed that about 25 civilians had been killed and125 wounded, in addition to a few casualties among service personnel. On the morning of the 12th June an enemyreconnaissance aircraft was brought down by gunfire off Malta.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.5.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theGerman attack was spreading eastward to the Meuse.   There were large enemy concentrations near Sedan.   The thrust here had notyet developed, but would probably drive down towards Verdun.W.M. (40) 163rd        Rheims was being cut off to the east by the advance of theConclusions,      enemy across the Marne at Chalons, where armoured formationsMinute 2.)        were being employed, and to the west by the enemy crossing theriver at Chateau Thierry.To the west of this area the French line still ran throughSenlis, and thence along the Oise. There seemed to be no heavy pressure towards Paris from the north. The capital would beencircled by the two main thrusts coming in from the east and thewest. The Germans claimed to be within 12 miles of Paris already.There was an. enemy armoured division well to the south of Rouenat Evreux.The arrival of the 1st brigade of the 52nd Division had had avery good moral effect on the French on the extreme left. Thisbrigade was filling a large gap in the front of the FrenchIII Corps. It had no artillery, but its bearing had been veryfavourably commented upon by the French. A French division wasbeing put in on its left and an improvised light mechanised division was making contact on its right. The remaining brigades of the52nd Division would not be able to reach the front that day, butthe remnants of Beauman&apos;s Division and an armoured division were still fighting well. General Brooke had arrived in France andwould be seeing General Weygand that day.The Secretary of State for War said that a message had just been received from the Howard-Vyse Mission. General Swayne,who had visited this part of the front on the previous day, had found the French in much better heart, and thought that the arrival of the troops of the 52nd Division might make all the difference tothem. The French Commander had expressed great appreciation of the work of the British armoured division, and there had been no atmosphere of recrimination.The First Sea Lord said that it had not yet been possible toascertain the number of troops which had been evacuated fromHavre.   It was believed that 11,000 British troops had been takenoff and disembarked at Cherbourg.    Some of the transports,[21411a] b 3The western front.(previous reference:
however, were still at sea and some had proceeded to Southampton.Between 1,000 and 1,500 troops taken off from the St. Valery area had been landed in the United Kingdom.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 162ndConclusions,Minute 3.)Enemy attacks on trade.Italianmerchantships.Mediterranean.6. The First Sea Lord said that there had been some increasein the activities of the enemy&apos;s submarines. The following ships had been attacked : June 11 S.S. Atholl Prince (8,782 tons), torpedoed 150 miles west of Finisterre; now making for Falmouth.June 12 S.S. EarVs Park (5,250 tons), torpedoed in the same position.June 12 S.S.  Willowbank (5,041 tons), in the homeward-boundSierra Leone convoy, torpedoed and sinking slowly.The destroyers working on the Western Approaches had been greatly reduced during recent operations and were now again beingstrengthened.The armed merchant cruiser Scotstoun had been torpedoed80 miles west of the Hebrides. Destroyers and aircraft were proceeding to assist.S.S. Princess Juliana (300 tons) was mined and sunk in the entrance to Poole harbour on the 12th June, and S.S. Baron Saltoun(3.404 tons) was mined and sunk in Cherbourg during the night thellth-12th.The Italian ship Alabama, (6,725 tons) was boarded by a Frenchauxiliary cruiser and beached on the coast of Venezuela aftertrying .to scuttle herself. H.M.A.S. Manoora had intercepted theItalian ship Romolo (9,780 tons) off north-east Australia, but she had scuttled herself.   The passengers and crew had been rescued.H.M. submarine Orpheus had sighted three Italian cruisers and six destroyers steering north-north-west 70 miles north-east of malta at noon on the 12th June. The attack on a submarine offMalta by H.M.S. Diamond, previously reported, was now thought to have been successful. The French had attacked a U-boat north of Algiers.Mines had been found off Alexandria.A motor torpedo boat, working in conjunction with aircraft,removed British troops from a wreck off Dunkirk on the 12th June.The FHrst Lord of the Admiralty reported that two explosionshad occurred in a ship loading tinned meat at Buenos Aires.Sabotage was suspected.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Turkey. 7.

Italy might lend herselfto such a scheme on the short view, though on a long view it would clearly be to her disadvantage to have Russia established in theStraits.The Lord President of the Council thought that the Italiansmight induce the Turks to limit their action to breaking offdiplomatic relations by pointing out that they did not intend totake any hostile action against Turkey, and were purely concernedwith helping Germany to defeat us. There did not, however,appear to be any further step which we could usefully take for themoment.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Egypt. 8.

The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff Committee recommending that, by means of a direct approach to Turkey, we should do everything we could to induceGreece and Yugoslavia to intervene on our side, and form a commonBalkan front (W.P. (40) 200).It was suggested that it would be inappropriate to discuss thePaper until the policy of Turkey had been clearly revealed. In the meanwhile, the Foreign Office would no doubt bear in mind therecommendations by the Chiefs of Staff, as an opportunity might still arise for action to be taken on the lines suggested.The War Cabinet agreed to defer consideration of theReport to a later date.10. The Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that no confirmation had yet been received of the statement which had appeared in the Press that the Spanish Government had announced its &quot;non-belligerency&quot; and not its neutrality. If thisnews were confirmed, it could not be regarded as very satisfactory.He also referred to telegram No. 316, dated the 11th June, 1940,from Sir Samuel Hoare, describing an interview which he had had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on that date.

prejudicial against Spanish neutrality during the last ten days.We survived that storm mainly owing to General Franco&apos;attitude. My arrival seems also to have encouraged anti-warparties, but Italian entry into the war has re-started warintrigue. In my considered view, we should take nothing for granted and spare no effort to increase immediately our influence with friends in or out of Government. This I amtrying to do.&quot;The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Japan. 11.

He understood that on thisn u last point it was now the intention of the Commander-in-Chief,Home Forces, not to use the wireless for giving orders.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that Section Iwas not inconsistent with the present policy in regard to voluntaryevacuation. This Section was also consistent with whatever decision was ultimately reached as to 60 per cent, evacuation from certain coastal towns.The War Cabinet approved the issue of the leaflet &quot; If theInvader Comes &quot; as set out in W.P.

Minister of Information, proposing that he  should be  givenAnnouncements, authority to co-ordinate and, if necessary, edit and generally control the issue of all official announcements intended to be broadcast,subject to certain specified conditions (W.P. (G.) (40) 144).In discussion it was urged that in case of disagreement thearrangement suggested might make for delay. It was necessary todeal as quickly as possible with announcements on Service matters,especially where German broadcasts had to be countered.Some doubt was also expressed as to the precise interpretation of paragraph 6 (iii), which laid down that if Service operations were the subject-matter of the announcement, the decision should rest with the responsible Department. The Minister&apos;&apos;of Informa-tion explained that the intention of this sub-paragraph was that,
2 $9V t? .\JSupply of Irish 14. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, in labour. consequence of the restrictions which had recently been imposed ontravel between Eire and this country, several hundred agricultural workers, who are accustomed at this time of the year to migrate toGreat Britain to engage in farming operations, mainly in connec-tion with the early potato crop in Scotland, were now held up in dublin and were demonstrating at the United Kingdom permitoffice. He (the Dominion Secretary) understood that these workers were essential to the agricultural life of this country. Sir JohnMaffey had represented that, if permits were withheld, there wouldbe a grave risk of disorder with adverse effects on good relationswith the Irish Government. He hoped therefore that, subject to appropriate measures of control by local authorities in Scotland,who were accustomed to handling this type of worker, steps wouldbe taken at once to reach a decision as to the grant of permits.The Secretary of State for the Home Department said that,while he agreed that these workers were needed for agriculture, thequestion arose of the risk to security, since some of the Irishmenwho were seeking to come to this country might have been in touchwith the German Legation in Dublin, and might be in a positionto do mischief. The position had been examined by the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office, in his capacity as chairman of the Overseas Travel Committee, who had presented aMemorandum suggesting the introduction of a scheme for allowing the agricultural workers to enter this country, subject to certainsafeguards. This Memorandum was being circulated asW.P. (G.) (40) 147. It was important that a decision should begiven on the scheme in the course of the day.The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council to examine thescheme suggested in W.P. (G.) (40) 147, and to give thenecessary directions on their behalf.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,June 13, 1940.in the event of disagreement between his Department and a service Department on an announcement of which the subject-matter was Service operations, the final decision should rest withthe responsible Department.Some discussion also ensued in regard to the wording ofparagraph 9. It was suggested that this paragraph as nowdrafted was perhaps somewhat wider in its scope than was intended.The Lord President of the Council said that he would be glad of an opportunity of discussing this matter further with theMinister of Information and the Service Ministers.The &quot;War Cabinet agreed to this course.
