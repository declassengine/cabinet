The following figures were given of the numbers evacuatedup to 12 noon, the 2nd June :-British FitCasualtiesAllied-FitCasualtiesTotal: 276,030.202,60512,764215,36959,86679560,661The War Cabinet were informed that the evacuation, whichhad had to be discontinued during the day, would start again at   p.M. that evening. The enemy were still being held at the wallsof Dunkirk. The French had taken over the defence of the perimeter.The Prime Minister said that he had received a visit from theFrench Ambassador, who had delivered a message asking that air action should be taken to cover the evacuation of the remainingFrench troops who were due to be withdrawn that night and thenext day. It had been explained to M. Corbin that, if Dunkirkcould hold out until the following night, air action would becontinued and that all facilities would be available for the with-drawal of the French troops.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it was proposed to telegraph to General Alexander to this effect, adding that any withdrawal must be effected with the concurrence of admiral Abrial.Broadcast The Secretary of State for War said that he had been asked bystatement. the Minister of Information to broadcast that evening. He wouldhave to say something as to the extent to which we had succeeded in bringing the British Expeditionary Force home. &apos; He invited theviews of the War Cabinet as to the extent to which it was desirableto give precise details.In discussion, the following points were made : (i) The result achieved should be expressed in the form of thepercentage evacuated out of the total number of troops which had been north of the Somme.(ii) Care should be taken not to give the impression that thepercentage of British troops evacuated was disproportionately-disproportionately higher than that of the French troops; and reference should be made to the fact that the number ofFrench troops which we had evacuated was additional to those embarked by the French themselves and takento French ports.The War Cabinet :-(1) Took note of the above discussion.(2) Agreed that the Secretary of State for War should framehis announcement on the wireless that evening in thelight of the discussion recorded above.[21370]

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the discussion on the previous day regarding the plans for possible air action against Italian industries, and, in particular,to the suggestion that Sir Percy Loraine should be authorised toinform Count Ciano of our intention to take immediate action withour bomber force against Italian industries if Italy came into thewar against us. He had understood that this suggestion had notbeen definitely approved by the War Cabinet, but was to be further discussed at a meeting of the Defence Committee. He had not,therefore, taken any action on the Cabinet conclusion as drafted.The Prime Minister agreed, and said that it would he unfairon the pilots of our bomber aircraft to give the Italians precise information of the targets at which we should aim. preparations were already in hand in the South of France to allow the operationof bomber aircraft from those advanced bases. Once these baseswere established, our bombers could fly out to them, given goodweather conditions, within a few hours. Information that we were preparing these advanced bases would quickly reach the Italians.After some further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed :  That Conclusion (iii) to the Minute referred to in the margin should be amended co read as follows  (iii) Agreed : (a) That all preparations should continue to enable our bombers to operate against North Italy from aero-dromes in the South of France.(b) That news of these preparations should be allowed toleak out; but that(c) Sir Percy Loraine should not mention these prepara-tions to Count Ciano.Italy. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that every-Probable thing pointed to Italy having decided to come into the war againstintentions. us.

In Rome, the Italian authorities were discussing with conclusions Sir Percy Loraine the arrangements for placing a train at his minute 7.) &apos; disposal to enable him to leave the country.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had received atelegram from the Naval Attache in Rome stating that he hadreceived a report to the effect that the Italians proposed to enter the war between the 10th and 20th June, but that if the nextGerman attack failed to be decisive, the entry of Italy into the war might be further postponed.
Contraband The Minister of Economic Warfare said that there were control. number of Italian ships now on the high seas with provocativecargoes on board. Of these ships, the most important were thefollowing :  S.S. Fortunata due at Gibraltar on the 9th June, 1940,with a cargo of 3,700 tons of toluol.S.S. Barbarigo due at Gibraltar on the 9th June, 1940,with a cargo of 1,500 tons of copper and 2,200 tons oflubricating oil.S.S. Savoia due at Aden on the 3rd June, 1940, with3,000 tons of manganese ore.S.S. India due at Aden on the 8th June, 1940, with a cargo of 2,500 tons of manganese ore.S.S. Burma due at Gibraltar on the 3rd June, 1940, witha cargo of 5,000 tons of copper.All these cargoes were key war materials, and the amounts inquestion were far in excess of Italian pre-war requirements, andof the amount permitted under any defensible system of rationing.He asked for authority for these and similar ships to be intercepted.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that wehad told the French Government that we did not intend at present to intercept Italian ships, and proposed for our part to carry onon the basis of the deal negotiated by the Master of the Rolls.By various administrative methods we were, however, in fact,taking steps to slow down the clearance of Italian ships fromBritish ports. He agreed that we ought to take action in regard tothese ships. There were, however, two considerations which would need to be weighed : (a) The effect on the Italian Government.Signor Mussolini would no doubt protest, but, if he hadnot made up his mind to fight us, it was unlikely that the detention of these ships would make him change his mind;while, if he had already decided to enter the war, no harmwould be done.(6) The effect on the French Government.It was important that we should do nothing which theFrench Government might represent as action deliberatelycalculated to bring Italy into the war.The Foreign Secretary proposed to inform the French Govern-ment of the position by telegraph, and to state that we regarded theItalian action as intolerable, and that we accordingly intended toput a stop to it. He understood from the Minister for economic warfare that, if definite instructions to intercept such ships were issued on Tuesday, the 4th June, 1940, there would still be time to intercept the most important of the vessels concerned.The Prime Minister said that the case for intercepting theships was overwhelming, but he agreed that it would be well to warn the French in advance of what we proposed to do.  Personally,he thought that the bringing in of these ships was more likely tofife do good than harm, since it would show the Duce that we werenot frightened of him, and were prepared to take up any challengehe might offer.The War Cabinet agreed (1) That, subject to (2) below, Italian ships carrying provo-cative cargoes of key war materials to Italy should beintercepted and made subject to contraband control.(2) That, before effect was given to this decision, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should explain the positionto the French Government and inform them of the action
we proposed to take. In making the communication, theForeign Secretary would make it clear that we intendedto take action after a very short delay.Tangier. 5.

The Prime Minister said that he hoped that the GeneralDefeating Staff was giving the most intensive study to the problem of tanks. defeating tanks.   It was of the utmost urgency that solutions tothis problem should be devised. On the one hand, there was thepossibility of adapting special weapons for this purpose, while, onthe other hand, it should be possible to devise some system forharrying and pursuing tanks. It should be possible to cut off tankcrews from supplies of food, water and petrol.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that all these problems were being intensively examined.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Invasion ofGreat Britain.(previous reference:W.M.

The Lord Privy Seal said that he hoped that it would bepossible for the War Cabinet to be furnished with a report on theprogress so far achieved in the preparations against invasion.The Secretary of State for War suggested that the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, should be invited to attend an early meetingof the War Cabinet to report on this subject.The War Cabinet agreed That arrangements should be made for the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, to make a report on this subject at the meeting of the War Cabinet to be held on Tuesday,the 4th June, 1940.Norway. 8.

TELEGRAM PROM GENERAL SPEARS TRANSMITTED by sub-.LT.- S.  McKENZIE,RECEIVED BY COMMANDER COLLARD AT1515&quot;W   &quot;&quot;&quot; JUNE. 19UO.Duty Captain Assistant Speaking - Following message fromGeneral Spears for Mr. Winston Churchill.       Begins.(Translation begins)     Message from M. Paul Reynaud toMr. Winston Churchill.The &quot;battle about to begin on our Front is of a character so paramount to the common cause that I desireonce more to draw your attention to the necessity for thetwo-fold assistance of the British army and air forces.As regards the army, General Weygand points out thatthe B. E.F. was at the present time to have been increasedto iLf. divisions.      It may therefore be deduced that three &apos;divisions should be available and ready for embarkation.I may add that the 19l4-,000 men which you have just recovered from the northern Front ought, it appears, to make it possibleto follow up the early despatch of the   three !  availabledivisions with reconstituted units of a tested fighting value.As to air forces, we are in need of the assistance ofboth &quot;bomber and fighter - units.      We ask that the Britishbomber forces should, both before and during the battle about to begin, give assistance to at least as high a degree asthey did during the battle in the North.      It would appearthat this assistance could be given without basing yourbomber aircraft in France.As to fighters, whose role will be decisive since the outcome of the battle would be compromised if the enemy was left with the command of the air, I ask that you should give us assistance to a still greater extent than duringthe battle in the North.     No doubt British fighters couldnot operate from bases in England.      It is, therefore,necessary that you should take a decision to the effectthat for the duration of the battle, the British fighterstrength shall operate from bases in France.      Orders havealready &quot;been given to pur our own aerodromes at the disposalof the British fighter forces.     We are constructing newaerodromes for our ovm. aircraft.     A note on this subject,with a map, were handed this morning to General Spearsfor immediate transmittal.The efficacy of the British assistance on land andin the air will to a great extent depend upon the speedwith which it can be furnished.      We have indications ofan early attack at several points on the Front.Message ends.

If British aviation remains based on Great Britian to fighteventual German attack, French armies will have to support alonthe weight of battle.3.    It is essential that the maximum of British aviation, bothFighters and Bombers,  should continue to make maximum effort inforthcoming land battle on which future of Britain will dpeendas much as that of Prance.U.    With this end in view,  it is necessary that numerous air squadrons, particularly Fighters, should immediately be based in France so as to act in intimate liaison with our forces against the front and the immediate back areas of the enemy.5. If the French Armies are destroyed by bombardments and tankthis would also be the fate of the British armies in turn.Signed WEYGAND.Time of Origin:--   1935 hours /1Reed o130 hrs Shown M.0.7-Distribution:-   S.  of he /^w   GvX\^-*^*.C.

VuilleminCommander in Chief of AirForcestoThe General Commander in Chief,Chief of General Staff for national Defence of combinedtheatres of operations.1. The enemy is in a position to launch at short noticea fresh attack on our front, prepared and assisted by theirbombers;    interception of these bombers by a powerful force of fighter aircraft is bound to have a decisive influence on theresult of the battle.II. French Fighter aircraft, of which at the present only 350 are available, would soon be overwhelmed, if they areno^ heavily re-inforced right from the start of the enemy attack by British Fighter aircraft.    Such reinforcements,although produced tardily and in insufficient numbers at thetime of the battle which started on 10th May, proved however to be of value.    If we succeed in concentrating French andBritish fighters against the German bombers, we will be ableto inflict losses of crews on the German bombers which theywill be unable to replace for a considerable time;    this willbe for England the finest protection against air attacks.III. British Fighter aircraft will not be able to intervene from English bases unless the German attack islaunched against the lower Somme.    It is necessary that theBritish High Command should take every necessary measure sothat at least half, and if possible all, the Fighter aircraftbased in England   (620 aircraft)  could intervene in thiseventuali ty.Moreover in anticipation of attacks on other points of our front, it is necessary that the intervention ofBritish fighter units based in FRANCE should be prepared,that is to say:-A.    that

A*    that these units should he nominated by the british command;    it would be necessary that 20 Squadrons (320aircraft from the 620 based in ENGLAND) should be able to operate from bases situated in PRANCE.B. that their Order of Battle should be prepared.Only a restricted Order of Battle (3 bases) in thearea of the Lower SEINE has been in operation hitherto;    thedisposal of the 20 Squadrons provided for above could beprepared with advantage in the zone of the present ADVANCEDAIR STRIKING FORCE, a well situated zone from the tacticalpoint of view, and where the English units would findservices already installed.C. that the O.C. charged with bringing into operationthese units of re-re-inforcement in conjunction with the french command, should be appointed;    this officer should be theAir Marshal Commander in Chief of the British Air Forcesin France.IV. I have the honour to beg of you to intervene withthe British High Command in the most forceful manner inorder that they should make a decision as early as possiblein conformity with the suggestions of this notice;    it is,for the French Army, and in consequence, for both countries,a question of life or death.General Commander in Chief of theAir Forces.(3gd.)
