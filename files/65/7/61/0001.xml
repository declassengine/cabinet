The Air 1.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that in the previous day&apos;sSituation. fighting our aircraft had shot down 5 enemy fighters without loss,(Previous and that successful results had been achieved by our bombers on reference: targets behind the battle area. During the day operations, 4 of w.M. (40) 165th our medium bombers were lost, and during the night operation onlyConclusions, i heavy bomber, out of 163 operating, had failed to return.Minute 2.)Enemy activity.Four large unidentified aircraft had been reported flying overthe Penzance area at 11-25 p.m. the previous night, and the Germanmeteorological machine was said to be operating 375 miles west ofthe Lizard. The Eire Government had been informed of the flightsof enemy aircraft to Ireland.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to see that such flightswere brought to the immediate notice of the Eire Government bythe Air Ministry.Details of an intended operation are contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The western front.Progress of operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 165thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that therewas not much change to report in the situation in the Paris area,but that there were indications that the blow delivered in theChalons sector was turning eastwards towards Verdun with a viewto outflanking the Maginot Line. There was no great pressure onour own front where the second and third Brigades of the52nd Division were moving up. The 2nd Brigade Group of theCanadian Division were landing that day.It was not anticipated that the enemy movement in the Rouenarea would develop against Paris, but that the German armoured division in that area would strike south-west towards our communications at Le Mans and Nantes.Particulars in regard to future dispositions of the B.E.F. inFrance are contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 165thConclusions,Minute 4.)Enemy attacks on shipping.TheMediterranean.Movements ofBritish andItalian Fleets.3. The Chief of Naval Staff gave the War Cabinet particulars of the various troop convoys which were on the seas.Thirty-seven survivors from H.M.S. Glorious and H.M.S.Acasta had been landed in the Faroe Islands by a merchant ship.The Armed Merchant Cruiser Scotstoun had been torpedoed and sunk on the morning of the 13th.Enemy attacks on shipping had included: The British tanker British Inventor (7,101 tons) mined and beached off Portland on the 13th.The Norwegian tanker Orkanger (8,029 tons) torpedoed and sunk off Alexandria.The Greek steamer Mount Hymmetus (5,820 tons)torpedoed 150 miles West of Finisterre, on the 11th.The Finnish steamer Margareta (1,860 tons) torpedoed and sunk off the North-West coast of Spain on the 9th.The Submarine Grampus had laid a minefield to block the entrance of Port Augusta, Sicily.Dealing with the general situation in the Mediterranean, theChief of Naval Staff said that at the time our Fleet had beenSouth of Cape Matapan, the Italian fleet comprising the Cesariand other ships, had been 15 miles West of Kephalonia. It was evident that the Italians had been aware of the position of ourFleet, which indicated that they had not been prepared to engage[21412]b 2
it. The British Fleet, on the other hand, had been in ignorance of the position of the Italians. The Chief of Naval Staff pointedout that this was an advantage which was constantly enjoyed bythe Italians through their preponderance of shore-based aircraft,by contrast with the very limited facilities for air reconnaissanceenjoyed by the British Fleets.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Battalions forIndia.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 129thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet of the present position and probable date of arrival of the 8 Regular Battalions now on their way to this country from India.He suggested that there might be advantage in delaying the departure of the 12 Battalions which, under present arrangements,would shortly leave this country to take their place.After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed -(1) That the departure of the 12 Battalions which were dueto leave this country for India should be delayed for atleast a fortnight.(2) That the ships which had been earmarked to take these troops to India should first be used for the transporta-tion of internees to Canada.(3) To invite the First Lord of the Admiralty to take such steps as might be possible to hasten the passage of the 8 Battalions on their way from India.France.M. Eeynaud&apos;s appeal toPresidentRoosevelt.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 165thConclusions,Minute 1.)A&quot;5. The Prime Minister said that a message had now beenreceived from the American Ambassador to say that president roosevelt was unwilling that his message of the 13th June, in answer to M. Reynaud&apos;s appeal, should be published. Mr. Kennedyhad asked whether he (the Prime Minister) would explain theposition to M. Reynaud. Fie had declined to do so, and had stressedstrongly that, if President Roosevelt appeared now to be holdingback, this would have a disastrous effect on French resistance.Reference was made to telegram No. 405 from Sir R. Campbell,referring to pernicious reports that Britain would liberate Francefrom her engagements if America should not declare war. Thequestion was discussed whether it was necessary to take steps to deny these rumours. The Prime Minister suggested that theForeign Secretary should send a message to Sir R. Campbellpointing out that, in our view, President Roosevelt&apos;s message of the13th June gave M. Reynaud the assurance of further support which he considered essential.&apos; In this telegram reference might also be made to these rumours, and an opportunity taken ofdenying them.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also reported a conversation which he had had on the previous evening with theFrench Ambassador. The latter had urged that it was all very well to say that we were doing our utmost to help France, but wasnot something more dramatic required ? Were we, for example,concerting plans for helping the French to defend some last corner of their country or for them to help us in the defence of these islands? He had also suggested that this country ought to receivetwo or three millions of the six or seven millions of war refugeesnow in southern France, and had not taken kindly to the reply that,from the blockade point of view, it was more advantageous to us
that these millions should be where they were. Altogether, it hadbeen a confused and not very satisfactory conversation.The War Cabinet took note of these statements and invited the Foreign Secretary to despatch a telegram to Sir R.Campbell on the lines suggested at &quot;A.&quot;9 Piel URome.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad received a note from the Apostolic Delegate asking whether wewould undertake not to bomb Rome, on account of its sacredcharacter.After discussion, the War Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to send a reply in thefollowing terms : That we should on no account molest the Vatican City,but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian Governmentobserved the rules of war.Turkey.Action inconsequence of italian declaration-tion of war.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 164thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to thefollowing telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angora,dated the 13th June, 1940 :--Telegram No. 540 reporting the conviction of the TurkishGovernment &quot; that the pure and simple application ofArticle 2 of the Tripartite Treaty would be likely to drawTurkey into an armed conflict with the U.S.S.R. They have in consequence decided to refer to the dispositions ofProtocol 2 of the Treaty.&quot;Telegrams Nos. 541 and 544 reporting conversations withthe Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to hisGovernments decision.Telegram No. 545 giving the text of a declaration to bemade by the Turkish Prime Minister to the effect that &quot; theGovernment of the Turkish Republic had decided in agreementwith the Allied Governments to adopt an attitude of non-belligerency.&quot;These telegrams showed that Turkey was not intending to fulfilher obligations under her Treaty with us. The probable explana-tion was that the Soviet Government, under pressure from germany in association with Italy, was adopting a threatening attitude inorder to give the Turks an opportunity of appealing to Protocol 2of the Treaty as an excuse for taking no action. No doubt thecourse of affairs in France had also weighed heavily with theTurkish Government.The Foreign Secretary could see no remedy for thisunfortunate situation; he proposed, however, to press the TurkishGovernment at any rate to recall their Ambassador from Rome, tomake clear that we could not accept the proposed declaration thatthey were acting in agreement with the Allies in adopting an attitude of non-belligerency, and to say that, if the TurkishGovernment persisted in their attitude, we should have to reserveour own liberty of action.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of this information.(ii) Approved the line which the Foreign Secretary proposedto take in communicating with the Turkish Government.
Tangier.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 152ndConclusions,Minute 5.)Entry of spanish troops.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that according to a telegram received that morningfrom Tangier, Spanish troops were at that moment about to occupy the Tangier territory. It had been contemplated all along thatwe and the French should invite the Spanish Government to occupyTangier in the event of war with Italy and it was very likely thatsome indication of this had reached the Spaniards from the French.He proposed that in any press announcement the line should betaken that the Spaniards had been invited by the French to occupy the city.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Egypt.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 164thConclusions,Minute 8.)9. The Prime Minister drew the attention of the War Cabinetto telegram 473, dated the 12th June, from His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Cairo reporting that urgent action was needed to stop a rot from spreading in the Egyptian Army.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that so farwe had had reason to conclude that events were not working outtoo badly from our point of view in Egypt. Presumably theItalians would have to carry out some attacks on Egyptian territorybefore long which would leave the Egyptian Government no opportunity for delaying a decision to declare war on Italy.The War Cabinet took note of this discussion.Plans to meet aCertainEventuality.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 162ndConclusions,Minute 9.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum prepared by the Chiefs of Staff, for use as an Aide-memoire by HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington (W.P. (40) 203).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadone or two minor drafting amendments to suggest.The War Cabinet Approved the despatch of this Memorandum for use as an aide-memoire by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington, subject to such minor amendments as mightbe found necessary.CompulsoryCensorship.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 153rdConclusions,Minute 9.)11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Information on Compulsory Censorship (W.P. (G.)(40) 145).On the suggestion of the Minister of Information the WarCabinet agreed that the proposals relating to compulsory censorshipmade by the Minister of Information in his Memorandum (W.P.(G.) (40) 145), should be referred to a Committee constituted asfollows : The Lord President of the Council (Chairman);The Minister of Information;together with :The First Lord of the Admiralty;The Secretary of State for War;The Secretary of State for Air;The Minister of Home Security;or their representatives.
