The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the lord president of the Council covering a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary on the dispersal of persons resident in the immediateneighbourhood of specific targets (W.P. (G.) (40) 130).The Lord President of the Council drew attention to the firstrecommendation, namely, that no attempt should be made to arrangefor voluntary dispersal of population until there had been such air attack on this country as would bring home clearly to people the dangers to which they were exposed. Events on the Continent mighthave a rapid and considerable effect upon public opinion in thisrespect.The Prime Minister thought that the Germans would not adopta policy of indiscriminate bombing. Their action in Norway and poland could not be taken as a guide. In attacking this countrythey would find it far more profitable to concentrate on specificmilitary targets.The Home Secretary said that he had arranged for public feeling to be continuously tested and for persuasion to be appliedboth by school-teachers and by civil defence officials.

(40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 15.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary on &quot; Invasion of Great Britain: possibleco-operation of a Fifth Column&quot; (W.P. (G.) (40) 131).The Home Secretary explained the steps which had alreadybeen taken in regard to enemy aliens.In the discussion which ensued on the various further measuresof internment dealt with in the Memorandum, the following points were made : (1) The task of picking up and sorting out aliens imposed avery heavy burden on the Police, who must not be askedto carry too heavy a burden at any given moment.
(2) In this connection, the Police already had a very heavytask on hand in dealing with 100,000 refugees who were on their way to this country, mostly from Belgium. TheHome Secretary regretted that we had already under-taken to receive another 100,000 refugees, but he hopedthat this number might be cut down. Any Germansfound in the batches of refugees reaching this country would at once be interned on arrival.(3) If war broke out with Italy, it was proposed to intern allmale Italians who had been less than 20 years in thiscountry and such British Italians as were members ofthe Fascist Party.(4) The Home Secretary thought that, if it was felt to bedesirable to impose some further restrictions on enemy aliens, this should take the form of imposing further restrictions on exempted enemy aliens who lived outsidethe special military zone, subject to exceptions inparticular cases. If this course were adopted, the samerestrictions should also be imposed on non-enemy alienswho had been here for less than five years.(5) The extent of the danger to be apprehended from womenrefugees was open to argument. The Home secretary was, however, prepared to intern all women enemy aliensin category B as soon as the necessary organisation hadbeen established to cope with them.(6) The question was raised whether the upper age limit of 60was appropriate, seeing that men above this age mightwell be actively engaged in organising enemy activities.(7) In regard to British Fascists, the Home Secretary explainedat length the difficulty of taking any effective action inthe absence of evidence which indicated that theorganisation as such was engaged in disloyal activities.(8) The view was expressed that the position in Eire was a very dangerous one. The difficulty was to see how to dealwith it, failing some easement of the relations betweenthe North and South.The Prime Minister summed up the discussion by saying that hethought the general view of the War Cabinet was that it would bedesirable to stiffen up the measures already taken.The Home Secretary was invited to review the matter inconsultation with the Lord Privy Seal and the minister without Portfolio, in the light of the above discussion, andto report again to the War Cabinet within a week&apos;s time.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 18, 1940.
