The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the finalmeasure of evacuation of French troops from Dunkirk had beencarried out during the preceding night, and that no further opera-tions had taken place. The total numbers of evacuated troopsentrained in Great Britain up to midnight the previous night hadbeen as follows : British FitCasualtiesA Hied FitCasualties211,25813,05384,6751,230Total310,216It was hoped that a considerable further number of French troops would have been landed after midnight.The total British casualties were between 33,000 and 34,000.Deducting the wounded brought to this country, about 20,700remained unaccounted for. Most of these must have been killed ortaken prisoner. It was possible, however, that a certain number ofmen might be trying to make their way back independently in a south-westerly direction, since the Germans did not hold a con-tinuous line.The First Sea Lord said that the Navy were keeping a look-out for individual British soldiers who might reach the French coast.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Germansstill retained the bridgeheads on the Somme. The French, however,were attacking at Abbeville that day and hoped to seize this bridge-head. One brigade of the 51st Division was taking part in the attack.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there could now be no doubt that the Germans were preparing an offensive against the French. German concentrations had been observed nearHirson, Amiens and Abbeville. It might be hoped that the attackat Abbeville would interfere with the German plans in that partof the line. It appeared most likely that the brunt of the attack would fall on the Amiens sector, in which case the German objective was Paris. The concentration near Hirson was probably intendedto protect the German left flank.The German attack might be expected to begin in four or five days&apos; time, or even earlier.There were also indications that the enemy&apos;s formations of armoured fighting vehicles were being reconstituted, which mightpoint to some further attempt against our communications, or thoseof the French. The German plan might be to cut us off from theremaining Channel ports west of the Somme.There had been no recent indications of any German offensivethrough Switzerland.[21379]b 2
Evacuation of The Lord President of the Council recalled that in order tothe B.E.F.: comply with the wishes of the French it had been decided not to publication of make any public announcement of the actual numbers of troopsnumbers evacuated from Dunkirk. The Secretary of State for War in hisevacuated. broadcast address on the 2nd June had therefore spoken of four-previous fifths of the force as having been evacuated. In a talk given laterReference: in the same broadcast programme, the figure 250,000 had been givenW.M.

(40) 153rdConclusions,Minute 3.)bomber command.fighter command.coastal command.British AirForces inFrance.3. The Chief of the Air Staff said that 142 sorties had beenmade during the night. One of our heavy bombers was missing;two had crashed on return, one of these having collided with aballoon cable at Felixstowe.Attacks had been directed against oil objectives in the Ruhr,with marshalling yards as alternative targets. Reports so farreceived indicated that the most successful attack had been on the refinery at Monheim, at which a fire had been started which couldbe seen 30 miles away. Many aircraft had reported that they hadnot been able to identify their primary targets, and had thereforebombed marshalling yards, which had been clearly seen, in par-ticular that at Essen, which had shown signs of much activity.Twelve Wellingtons had attacked in the neighbourhood ofBergues, and batteries between Gravelines and Dunkirk had alsobeen attacked successfully.Only two enemy raids had been plotted during the day oneoff the North Foreland, and one off Peterhead, which had latercrossed the coast.At night a number of low flying raids had been recorded offthe South Coast, between Dungeness and the Isle of Wight.On the French coast, sixteen daylight raids had been plottedbetween Zeebrugge and the mouth of the Somme. Dusk raids hadbeen plotted over the mouth of the Seine. At night a number ofcoast raids had proceeded as far south as Dieppe.Early on Monday morning our Fighter Patrols over Dunkirkhad engaged two enemy bombers without success. One of our air-craft was missing, and another had crashed on landing. Duringthe night a standing patrol of one Blenheim fighter had been maintained, and at 4 a.m. that morning 48 aircraft had been dispatched.   Reports were not yet available.During the day, attacks had been made on various surfacevessels, and on two U-boats, but no successful results had beenreported.During the previous night, oil tanks at Rotterdam and Ghenthad been attacked.   One of our Ansons had failed to return.During the night 2nd-3rd June, Battle squadrons had success-fully attacked communications in the Givet and Conz areas.Nineteen Fighter sorties had been made on the 3rd June.Casualties -missing.British 2 Hurricanes-11 Hurricane lost, pilot savedEnemy 2 Me. 110.
The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 153rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Blocking of dunkirk.4. The First Sea Lord said that, when the third blockship wasbeing sunk in Dunkirk harbour, the detonating of the charges hadbeen accompanied by a very big explosion which was believed tohave been due to a magnetic mine. As the channel in which theblockship had been sunk had been constantly used by our ships,this provided another instance of the effectiveness of our degaussingapparatus.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Norway. 5.   The War Cabinet were given certain further information(Previous as to operations in Norway.   This is recorded in the Secretary&apos;reference:        Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.W.M. (40) 153rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Italy.contraband control.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 152ndConclusions,Minute 4.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 124thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Chief of Naval Staff referred to the War cabinet decision that, subject to consultation with the French Government,Italian ships carrying provocative cargoes of key war materials toItaly should be intercepted and made subject to contraband control.He asked what orders should be given to the Admiral at Gibraltarif any of these ships were escorted by Italian war vessels. It hadbeen decided on an earlier occasion to leave alone any Italian ships that might be escorted in this way, but the circumstances now were rather different. A battleship and a cruiser had been ordered to gibraltar so that they might be available in case of need. If bigships were required, the natural course would be to ask the Frenchfor assistance, but, in view of their general policy of taking no action that might annoy Italy, it was doubtful if they would agree.He did not, however, think it likely that the Italians would, in fact,be willing to send any of their capital ships into the western mediterranean, where they would run the risk of being cut off bythe French when hostilities broke out.       ..The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it wasvery difficult to suggest what instructions should be given to dealwith this eventuality, more particularly as the French Governmenthad not yet given their views on our proposal to intercept these ships.   No reply had yet been received from the French Govern-ment, and he would in any case like a little time to consider theW.M. (40) 153rd matter.   If we did decide to hold up the ships, he thought that conclusions,      this could be fully justified by the present attitude of the ItalianGovernment and that it would therefore fit in reasonably well withthe general line that M. Reynaud was proposing to take in hisbroadcast speech on the question of Italy (telegram No. 322 DIPP,dated the 3rd June, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris).The Master of the Rolls had, however, given it as his opinion thatwe were acting unwisely in proposing to intercept these ships at all.[21379] ..B 3(previous reference:Minute 6.)Norway. During the period 1800 hours, the 2nd June, to 1800 hours, the3rd June, 18 fighter sorties had been made, but there had been nointerceptions.Enemy activity. The bombs reported as having been dropped in Ashdown Foreston the previous day had now turned out to have been magnetic mines.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
The Lord President of the Council urged that we should in no circumstances allow these very valuable cargoes to reach Italy.The War Cabinet Deferred a decision on the point raised by the Chief ofthe Naval Staff.italy - 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionProbable to a report passed on by the French Government as received from aintentions. secret and reliable source in Rome to the effect that, following a(Previous meeting of the Council of Ministers on the 5th June, the ItalianEef erence: Government would present the Allies with an ultimatum demandingW.M. (40) 152nd very substantial concessions in the Mediterranean. The Allies were conclusions, to be given 24 or 48 hours in which to decide whether to accept the minute 4.)        Italian terms.   If they refused, Italy would make war on them;if they accepted, she would offer to act as an intermediary withGermany for negotiating an honourable peace.The Prime Minister suggested that, if such an ultimatum were received, our rejection should take the form of an air attack onItalian industrial centres, without waiting for the expiry of atime limit. It would, of course, be necessary to secure the agree-ment of the French Government to this course.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Belgium.proposed statement bythe BelgianGovernment.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 144thConclusions,Minute 1.)United States ofAmerica.Supply of destroyers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 151stConclusions,Minute 10.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theBelgian Ambassador had called on him that morning to make astatement on behalf of the Belgian Government. They were quite clear that they were constitutionally correct in declaring that theKing was incapable of reigning, in view of his surrendering to theGermans, but they were having some difficulty in deciding how to handle the matter for the purposes of a public pronouncement.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that theUnited States Ambassador had told him that he had again raised with his Government two days before the question of the possi-bility of the Allies obtaining destroyers from the United States.He had been encouraged by the fact that he had at any rate not received a negative answer, and in the meantime the reconditioningof the destroyers was proceeding. He (the Foreign Secretary)thought that President Roosevelt was probably waiting for italy to enter the war before taking any definite action in this and similar matters.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Invasion ofGreat Britain.defence measures.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 152ndConclusions,Minute 7.)10. The Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, gave the WarCabinet a brief description of the preparations being made for defence against invasion. A big advance had been made in the last four or five days. All the Divisions were now being organised onthe basis of mobile brigade groups, the policy being to hold thereserve in readiness to move to certain places.The Commander-in-Chief then gave details of the preparations for defence, particulars of which are given in a Memorandum whichis being circulated separately.Among the points raised in discussion were the following : (a) Road Blocks. The policy was to keep the main roads freefor the movement of our own troops, possible enemy
Invasion ofGreat Britain.Campaign toprepare publicopinion for thepossibility of invasion.11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinistry of Information summarising a scheme for a campaign to warn and rouse the public against the imminent danger of invasion (W.P. (40) 190).The Minister of Information said that the position had changedsomewhat since this scheme had been prepared. Public opinion was now fully alive to the risks of invasion. Further, to start a campaign now might give colour to the opinion that we were turningour attention away from France and concentrating on the defenceof this country. He was therefore against launching the proposedcampaign at the present time.movements being prevented by troops with artillery.Obstacles were being provided on side roads to hold upenemy vehicles, and strong points were being made invillages.The Lord President of the Council said that themovement of refugees on roads required for militaryuse might hamper our own troops. While people mightbe warned to stay in their houses, there would always be a certain number of refugees from places which werebeing bombed. He suggested that it might be desirableto put up notices indicating which roads would berequired for military purposes, in order that refugeesmight avoid them.The Commander-in-Chief undertook to examine this question.(b) Armoured   Vehicles. Particulars   were   given   of   theprogress made with fitting out &quot; Ironsides,&quot; i.e., motorcars fitted with bullet-proof plating and mounting aBren gun. 150 would be ready by the end of the week,and 600 to 700 by the end of the month.(c) Eire. The   Commander-in-Chief  said  that,  while   thepresence of the B.E.F. should ensure that we should beable to deal effectively with parachute troops, he was less satisfied with the position in Ireland.(d) Suspected and Disaffected Persons. The Secretary  ofState for Home Affairs said that in the last few days the Police had been given very wide powers to detainsuspects. Persons could now be held on reasonable grounds of suspicion by Police Constables for 24 hours,by Police Inspectors for 48 hours, and by chief constables for 5 days. The 350 local officials of theBritish Union of Fascists were being arrested. Further,all aliens were being excluded from- a defined coastalstrip. He hoped that these steps would give a measureof reassurance to public opinion. -(e) Naval Measures. The First Lord of the Admiralty outlined the steps that he was taking to deal with attack bymotor torpedo-boats.The War Cabinet (1) Took note of the above statements.(2) Invited the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, to examinethe desirability of indicating by notices which roadswould be required for military purposes in the event of invasion.
The War Cabinet Agreed that the proposed campaign should not be launchedimmediately, but should be held in readiness for operation at a later date.Session ofParliament.Invasion of 12.   The Lord Privy Seal said that a request had been madeGreat Britain. for a Secret Session of Parliament to discuss the defence of this proposed Secret country against invasion.In discussion it was pointed out that there was not much whichthe Government spokesman could say on this matter in a secret session which could not also be said in public. On the other hand,Members of Parliament felt the need of an occasion on which theycould state openly their views as to the situation of this countryin regard to defence against invasion, and to point out whatappeared to them to be weaknesses, without at the same timedisclosing information to the enemy. It was generally felt that theadvantages of a Secret Session on this matter outweighed the disadvantages. It was thought that the date for the Secret sessions should be, not the 6th June, as proposed, but Tuesday, the11th June.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to make the necessary arrangements with the authorities of the House for a secret session of Parliament to be held on Tuesday, the 11th June,to discuss home defence.Timber. 13.   The AVar Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theDevelopment of Minister of Supply (W.P. (G.) (40) 143).production inGreat Britainand France.The Minister of Supply explained that, to meet the very difficult situation arising from the lack of shipping and the disappearance of important sources of supply of foreign timber, measures must betaken to develop supplies of home timber both in France and theUnited Kingdom. A plan to set up a special Allied Committee forthis purpose had been drawn up by the Anglo-French Co-co-ordinating committee, and had been accepted by the French Government. the limiting factor was labour, both skilled and unskilled, and it would clearly be necessary to import skilled labour from Canada or else-where.The following points were made in discussion : (1) Further consideration should be given to the possibility ofobtaining timber from Russia. It was suggested thatit might be easier to arrange this by the Ministry ofSupply giving orders through trade channels rather thanby raising the matter through diplomatic channels, whichmight lead to arguments. It was pointed out, however,that the list of commodities covered by Sir stafford cripps&apos;s prospective negotiations included timber.(2) No further timbermen would be available from Newfound-land.(3) The scheme contemplated bringing large numbers of skilledlumbermen from Canada. This might affect the con-stitution of the 3rd and 4th Canadian Divisions, andmight also conflict with the War Office requirements inrespect of Canadian railway transport workers. Thequestion of priorities would therefore have to be con-sidered.
(4) The Canadian Government had already agreed in principle to form forestry units on special financial conditions, andthe Dominions Office were awaiting precise information from the War Office in regard to their particular require-ments. These requirements represented, however, onlya very small proportion of the labour contemplated underthe proposals in the scheme before the War Cabinet.(5) It would help matters if part of the labour required couldbe obtained from Finland or Norway.(6) Again, it might be possible to make arrangements fortraining unskilled workers in the United Kingdom, tomeet some of the requirements of skilled labour in thiscountry.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Minister of Supply as setforth in (W.P. (G.) (40) 143) subject to further considera-tion of the points raised in discussion, and in particular : (a) The Ministry of Supply should make enquiries throughtrade channels as to the possibility of obtainingtimber from Russia.(6) The Minister of Supply, after consultation with theSecretary of State for War, should notify to theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs a figurerepresenting a minimum requirement of Canadianlumbermen, in order that an immediate start couldbe made with recruiting a number of specialCanadian forestry units.(c) Consideration should be given by the Secretary of Statefor War and the Minister of Supply in consultation,to the effect of the full proposals, set out in thelatter&apos;s paper for the recruitment of Canadianlumbermen, on the constitution of the 3rd and 4thCanadian Divisions and on the War Office require-ments of railway personnel.id) The Foreign Secretary should enquire into thepossibility of obtaining skilled labour from finland and Norway.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 4, 1940.
