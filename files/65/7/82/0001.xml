Syria.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 184thConclusions,Minute 8.)proposed declaration byHis Majesty&apos;sGovernment.1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 231) proposing that, now that General Mittelhauser had declared that hostilities had ceased in Syria, a declaration should be issued by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. The object of this declaration was to hold the position,without entering into far-reaching commitments. The terms suggested were as follows : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomunderstand that General Mittelhauser, the Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in the Levant, has stated thathostilities have ceased in Syria. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentassume that this does not mean that, if Germany or Italysought [were to demand the right] to occupy Syria or the lebanon and were to try to do so in the face of British command of the sea, no attempt would be made by the French forces to oppose them. In order, however, to set at rest doubts whichmay be felt in any quarter, His Majesty&apos;s Government declare that they could not allow Syria or the Lebanon to be occupiedby any hostile Power or to be used as a base for attacks upon those countries in the Middle East which they are pledged todefend, or to become the scene of such disorder as to constitute a danger to those countries. They therefore hold themselvesfree to take whatever measures they may in such circumstancesconsider necessary in their own interests. Any action whichthey may hereafter be obliged to take in fulfilment of this declaration will be entirely without prejudice to the future status of the territories now under French mandate.&quot;The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was fully in agreement with the proposed declaration.The War Cabinet-Approved the issue of the declaration in the terms setout above, subject to the incorporation of the words under-lined and to the omission of the words in square brackets,and subject to consultation with His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Angora.Norway.Future of theRoYal House.2.
