The Air 1.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that during the previousSituation. day the only raids plotted near the British Isles had been recon-(Previous naissance   and   meteorological   flights.    Cloud   conditions   had reference:        prevented interceptions.W.M. (40) 174thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air raids on During the night of the 21st-22nd June, enemy aircraftGreat Britain, estimated at approximately 100, had crossed the East and south coast of England and had dropped bombs in parts of Yorkshire,Lincolnshire, and East Anglia. There had also been reports ofexplosions at Tilbury and Dagenham. Bombing had appeared to&apos;be directed against aerodromes and R.D.F. stations, but had beenvery inaccurate and, according to reports so far received, very little damage had been done. The enemy aircraft had come over at agreat height and although Fighter Patrols had been sent up, hazeand moderate visibility had prevented more than one (unsuccessful)&apos;interception being made.Reconnaissances had been carried out over the aerodromes in north-East France the previous evening, but no enemy aircraft had been seen either on the ground or in the air. Nine aircraft,escorted by fighters, had carried out dive-bombing attacks on thenew gun emplacements near Calais. Four direct hits had beenclaimed and we had lost one Roc, shot down by A.A. fire.During the previous day medium bombers had been sent toattack oil plants and marshalling yards in North-West Germany,but lack of cloud cover had prevented most of these attacks takingplace. Hits had been secured on aerodromes and on barges in the scheldt Canal. It had not been possible to Carry out a recon-naissance over the Dortmund-Ems aqueduct, but a further attempt was being made that morning.   All our aircraft had returned.During the night of the 21st-22nd June, 111 of our heavy bombers had been over Germany. The main attack had been directed against air store depots and aircraft factories, as it was now our object to reduce the scale of enemy air attack on thiscountry. Secondary targets had been oil plants and marshalling yards. No reports were yet available, but two of our aircraft hadbeen reported missing.Attacks on The Scharnhorst and six destroyers had been sighted steamingenemy ships. southwards during the previous morning and had been shadowedand subsequently attacked by nine Beauforts and six Hudsons.Three direct hits and two near misses had been obtained on the scharnhorst, but three Beauforts had been lost. One Messerschmitthad been shot down in flames.   (See also Minute 3 below.)Various attacks had been carried out against enemy merchantshipping, in which one merchant vessel and one transport had been sunk, and several direct hits obtained on barges. A hit had alsobeen obtained on an enemy destroyer. Two Me. 109&apos;s had been shot down during these operations.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Attacks onNorthernPrance.Attacks on germany.The MilitarySituation.evacuation from Prance.(previous reference:W.M.

reported that 2,500 French Air Pilots and some 20 wireless expertswould reach Bayonne shortly. 8,000 Czech troops were reportedto be moving from Marseilles to Cette.The Chief of Naval Staff, in reply to a question, said thatthere would be a good chance of getting these Czechs and any other allied troops away, if news of their whereabouts could be received in time.Home Defence. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had received a visit from Admiral Dreyer who had been very anxious about theundefended state of some of the beaches on our South-East Coast.He had mentioned a stretch of 8 miles where there was a very big rise and fall in tide. An invasion might begin any day now and there seemed to be a shortage of labour for digging and wiring.Admiral Dreyer had suggested that more civilians should beemployed.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that 100,000civilians were already employed on coastal defence works. He hadalready sent the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, some notes on the part of the coast to which the First Lord had referred.The Lord President of the Council pointed out that the Govern-ment had full poAvers to requisition any labour, materials andtransport that were required. The military commanders had onlyto ask for what they wanted.The War Cabinet-Took note of  the above  statements, and  invited theSecretary of State for War to ensure that full use wasmade, wherever necessary, of the powers of requisitioning.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 174thConclusions,Minute 4.)the scharnhorst.TheMediterraneanFleet.Enemy attacks on shipping.3. The Chief of Naval Staff said that air reconnaissance onthe previous day had reported the Scharnhorst to be off the SogneFjord, steering South, escorted by destroyers. She had been attacked in the afternoon by aircraft of Coastal Command (as reported in Minute 1 above), and her subsequent positions showed that she had lost speed as the result of having been hit. The lastreport from aircraft gave the position of the Scharnhorst 40 miles south-West of Haugesund (near Stavanger) at 7-30 p.m. two enemy cruisers and five destroyers had been 35 miles North-west of her. By midnight, the 21st-22nd, British Naval forces were disposed more or less surrounding the Scharnhorst. Enemy aircraft had been observing them continuously, and it was accordingly decided that our ships should carry out a final sweep to the North-ward. The result of this sweep seemed to show that the Scharnhorsthad probably entered Stavanger, or had escaped to the South. at-23 a.m. our forces, which were still being shadowed by enemy aircraft, had been ordered to withdraw.Particulars were given of an impending operation by theMediterranean Fleet.Enemy attacks on shipping had included : 20th June :The Swedish ship Tillia Gorthon (1,776 tons), torpedoed and sunk 100 miles South-West of Land&apos;s End..21st June :R.F.A. Prunella (2,500 tons), torpedoed 120 miles WestSouth-West of Land&apos;s End.The British ship Alrawda (3,540 tons), attacked by aU-boat 60 miles West of Hartland Point.
The British tanker Yarraville (8,627 tons), torpedoed and sunk 120 miles South-West of Cape Roca (near Lisbon).Lifeboats from the French ship Ville de Namur (7,463 tons)had been picked up in the Bay of Biscay and it must be presumed that she had sunk.The French ship A ragaz (5,009 tons) had been gunned bya submarine in the middle of the Bay of Biscay.The Belgian ship Luxemburg (5,809 tons) had been sunk60 miles South of Ushant.22nd June :At 1 a.m. S.S. Ash Crest (5,652 tons) had been attacked by a submarine in the Mediterranean 5 miles South of CapeNao (Spain).   No further particulars were known.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.France.(previous kef erence:W.M.

(40) 174thConclusions,Minute 4.)French warships in the eastern mediterranean.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams received from Sir Ronald Campbell:  Bordeaux telegram No. 497. Reporting General deMarancourt as having stated that all military aircraft at twoair stations were being ordered to proceed to Andover,refuelling at Jersey.Bordeaux telegram No. 501. Cancelling telegram No. 497.Bordeaux telegram No. 496 DIPP. Stating that the french minister for Foreign Affairs had given an assurance that hisGovernment would exchange views with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment as soon as the armistice conditions were known.Bordeaux telegram No. 498 DIPP. The French Govern-menfs move to Perpignan having been cancelled, Sir RonaldCampbell feared that the next thing might be the abandonment of the idea of sending the President of the Republic and the nucleus of the Government overseas. A number of parlia-mentarians had been put on board ship at Bordeaux; the ship was now hung up somewhere at the mouth of the Garonne.Unfortunately those of board were, in the main, men who stoodfor resistance. The defeatist element, including M. Laval, were still active in Bordeaux.Morale was still high in certain parts of the French colonial empire, where the military authorities appeared determined tocontinue the struggle.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that Admiral odend&apos;hal&apos;hal,who Avas at Portsmouth, had received orders from Admiral Darlanthat the French warships which were now in British ports were toleave for Africa. It was understood that they were to sail forDakar.The War Cabinet agreed that it Avas not desirable to run therisk of upsetting Admiral Darlan by making difficulties about theFrench warships leaving British ports.The First Lord informed the War Cabinet that the French warships in the Eastern Mediterranean were still in company withthe British Mediterranean Fleet.
Further message to the FrenchGovernment.&quot;XArmisticeconditionsdemanded byGermany.The Foreign Secretary was called away for a few minutes inorder to speak on the telephone to the Prime Minister, who was at chequers. On returning, the Foreign Secretary said that the PrimeMinister was anxious to send a further message to the FrenchGovernment reminding them that His Majesty&apos;s Government were entitled to be taken fully into their confidence at this criticaljuncture. His Majesty&apos;s Government had not released France fromthe solemn obligations which she had undertaken. It would not be consistent with French honour to permit their resources to be used against us by Germany.At a later stage in the meeting the Foreign Secretary read to the War Cabinet Bordeaux telegram No. 511 DIPP. this telegram, which had been despatched at 4-0 a.m. that morning,reported that the German conditions had now been received inBordeaux. They filled nine pages of type, and it was impossibleto telegraph the verbatim text. These included conditionsregarding the French Fleet, which would be telegraphed separately.No Italian representatives had been present at the meeting atCompiegne and the Germans had declined to disclose what theItalian terms were. The Franco-German Armistice would comeinto force as soon as the French Government had concluded an armistice with Italy. The cessation of hostilities would take placesix hours after the Italian Government had announced to theGerman Government the conclusion of the Franco-Italian armistice.The German Government would notify the French Government of&quot; cease fire &quot; by wireless.The War Cabinet :-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Invited the Foreign Secretary to transmit a  further message to the French Government on the lines proposedby the Prime Minister, and summarised at &quot; X &quot; above.FrenchShipping.Control ofFrenchmerchantshipping.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 174thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the french authorities were becoming apprehensive about our treatment ofFrench shipping. It was for consideration whether we were notpressing them too hard in this matter. The present day-to-daypolicy was that we were allowing French ships to sail for french colonial ports (outside the Mediterranean), but refusing thempermission to sail to neutral ports. He had explained the positionto the French Ambassador on the previous day; it had been agreedthat the Ambassador should give us particulars of the cargoes anddestinations of such ships as the French authorities might wish tobe exempted from our ruling.In discussion the following points were raised : -(i) The French had little cause for complaint, in view ofthe danger to the Allied cause constituted by the largecollection of French shipping which had failed to sailfrom French Atlantic ports.(ii) It was imperative that we should endeavour to conservefor the Allied oause as much as possible of the Frenchshipping which remained out of Germany&apos;s reach.(iii) We had no guarantee that French ships sailing under present conditions might not fall into the hands of theenemy; we were justified in taking all possible stepsto prevent this.(iv) It was considered permissible, on humanitarian grounds,to allow French ships carrying food to sail to French ports not occupied by the enemy,(v) The danger of allowing French ships to sail to neutral ports lay in the fact that, if France herself becameneutral, these ships would eventually be lost to us.
9 fThe EmileBertin.(previous reference erence  :W.M. (40) 174thConclusions,Minute 7.)Nevertheless, it was felt that a distinction could, with reasonable safety, be drawn between French ships sailingto the United States of America, and even to SouthAmerica, and those sailing to neutral ports in Europe.The War Cabinet agreed That until further orders, the Admiralty should exercise control over French shipping as follows : (a) French ships should continue to be allowed to sail for french Colonial ports, other than those in theMediterranean.(b) French ships carrying food should be allowed to sail to french ports not in occupation of the enemy.(c) No French ships other than those carrying food (see (6)above) should be allowed to proceed to any ports inFrance.(d) French ships carrying general cargo should be allowed toproceed to ports in the United States of America, and toports in South America, but to no other neutral ports.The First Sea Lord said that the French cruiser Emile Bertinhad left Halifax with a cargo of gold. She was stated to be goingto Martinique, and the French Admiral at that place was expectingher. She was being shadowed, in accordance with instructions, byH.M.S. Devonshire.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the PrimeMinister had spoken to him on the telephone when he had been discussing this matter with the French Ambassador. At that timethe Emile Bertin had not actually sailed, but the Prime Ministersinclination had been to let her proceed, in view of the Ambassador&apos;srepresentations. The Prime Minister had not, however, been satisfied about the bona pies of the message instructing the EmileBertin to sail to Martinique, and it was on that account that theDevonshire had been ordered to shadow her.The Foreign Secretary said that the Chancellor of theExchequer also had been in communication with him regarding theEmile Bertin.The War Cabinet Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to issue instruc-tions for the withdrawal of H.M.S. Devonshire fromshadowing the Emile Bertin, which should be allowed toproceed to Martinique.U.S.S.R.Baltic States.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 170thConclusions,Minute 6.)Anglo-soviet relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 171stConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, sofar as he could judge, the concentration of Russian forces in theBaltic States was a defensive measure. He did not credit the theorythat the Russians intended to launch an attack on East Prussia.There was no doubt, however, that Moscow was alarmed at the rapidmilitary progress which Germany had made in the west.The Foreign Secretary said that Sir Stafford Cripps, having had his first interview with M. Molotoff, was about to present hiscredentials to M. Stalin. It had been arranged that he should present a personal message from the Prime Minister to M. Stalin.In discussion, it was suggested that Anglo-Soviet relationsmight be further eased if the Prime Minister could find time for an interview with the Soviet Ambassador in London.
Spain. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention(Previous to Madrid telegram No. 384 DIPP of the 20th June, in which reference: Sir Samuel Hoare referred to certain measures which he had takenW.M. (40) 172nd to prevent the further deterioration of relations between this conclusions, country and Spain. If anything, the situation appeared to be a minute 7.)        little easier.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Portugal. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, if the visit to Lisbon  Duke of Kent was to carry out his engagement to attend theof H.R.H. the    Portuguese National Celebrations, he would have to leave forDuke of Kent.    Lisbon on the following Tuesday, the 25th June.   He was to travelby flying boat.   The arrangements for the visit had been approvedby His Majesty The King.The War Cabinet ought to be aware, however, of a message which had been received from His Majesty&apos;.s Ambassador in Lisbon(Lisbon telegram No. 293, dated the 21st June).Dr. Salazar had said to Sir Walford Selby that, greatly as thePortuguese Government were looking forward to the Duke&apos;s arrival,they would prefer the visit to be postponed until a more propitiousmoment rather than expose His Royal Highness to any risk asregards the journey. Dr. Salazar had made it clear that he had inmind only the Duke&apos;s safety. A later message received fromSir Walford Selby had referred to the likelihood of Lisbon being-filled with British refugees, which might possibly be an embarrass-ment to the Duke.In discussion, the view was expressed that the keeping of the engagement in such unpropitious circumstances might do much tostrengthen our position in Portugal. The greater the difficultiesin the way of keeping an engagement, the greater was usually thegratification of one&apos;s hosts.The War Cabinet-(i) Were of the opinion, on the facts before them, that it wouldbe desirable to proceed with the arrangements for the duke of Kenfs visit to Portugal,(ii) Left it to the discretion of the Foreign Secretary to makeany further submissions to His Majesty The King thatmight be required.Egypt.(previous reference erences:W.M. (40) 173rdConclusions,Minute 8, andW.M. (40) 174thConclusions,Minute 12.)9. The Foreign Secretary said that he had sent instructionsto Sir Miles Lampson on the lines approved by the War cabinet at the former of the two meetings referred to in the margin(telegrams to Cairo, Nos. 483 DIPP and 485 DIPP). several important telegrams had since been received from the Ambassador.Cairo telegram No. 571 reported that the italian ambassador still declined to leave, as no reply had beenreceived from Rome authorising him to do so. It was evidentthat he had no intention of departing. It was clear also thatthe present Government of Egypt would not only bring no serious pressure to bear on him to leave, but would also do their best to avoid placing a cordon around the Italian Legation.Cairo telegram No. 573 DIPP reported that Ali Maherwas still in office. Ahmed Maher (who thoroughly disapprovedof his brother&apos;s policy) had stated that King Faroukthreatened to abdicate rather than remove Ali M.aher. In themeantime, the whole of Egypt were aware that the BritishGovernment had demanded the Prime Ministers dismissal.
Every hour of delay in replacing him weakened our position,,and the number of those who still retained faith in us was rapidly decreasing. For example, Prince Mohamed Ali wastalking of leaving Egypt.Cairo telegram No. 574 contained Sir Miles Lampson&apos;srecommendations as to the course of action to be followed.This involved three stages : (a) The first stage would be once more to press king farouk to dismiss Ali Maher, and to accept a constitutional Government ready to carry out theTreaty. If he were willing to do so, the crisiswould pass without the necessity for the use of force. Sir Miles Lampson was taking this first step-forthwith.(b) Secondly, if King Farouk were obdurate, Nahas Pashashould be invited to form a Government. He wouldhave to be promised our full support, including, ifnecessary, the declaration and enforcement of martial law.(c) Thirdly, if Nahas Pasha declined to form a Govern-ment, or declined to hold office under martial law,we should have to administer the country ourselvesunder martial law, with the assistance of anyfriendly elements who were willing to collaborate with us.Cairo telegram No. 574a, reported that Sir Miles Lampsonwas informing Ali Maher that an effective cordon must be;imposed immediately, and maintained until the Italians left.If the Egyptian Government refused, the cordon would be1imposed by British troops. The Ambassador asked for authority to eject the Italians from Egypt if they still refusedto leave.In discussion the following points were raised : (1) King Farouk might be given one more chance, in the formof a 24 hours&apos; time limit, within which Ali Maher mustbe dismissed.On the other hand, it was pointed out that thesituation in Egypt was slipping, and delay had become very dangerous.It was noted from Cairo telegram No. 549 DIPP,that Prince Mohamed Ali had hinted that, in the eventof King Farouk&apos;.s abdication, he himself might be a candidate for the throne. A successor to King Faroukwas thus available on the spot; if he would not complywith our demands, we ought to insist on his abdication.In any event we ought without delay to invite nahas pasha to form a Government.(2) If King Farouk abdicated there would be no question ofhis being free to go where he wished. In particular, hecould not be allowed to proceed to Italy. We did not want to see a puppet Egyptian Government established in that country.(3) It would be desirable to invoke, as the justification for ourinterference in the internal affairs of Egypt, Article 5of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which laid it down that neither of the High Contracting Parties would adopt an attitude towards foreign countries . which was inconsistent with the Alliance.(4) It was essential that Sir Miles Lampson, in suggesting toNahas Pasha that he should assume office, should makeit clear that he would be expected to expel the Italian
Minister and his staff forthwith. If he failed to do so,or failed to form a Government, the British authorities would have to expel them.(5) If Nahas Pasha failed us, we should be at the third stagecontemplated in Cairo telegram No. 574, in which weshould administer Egypt under martial law.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo to take actionimmediately in the light of the above discussion. Theprincipal points on which action was to be taken were : (a) King Farouk must either fall in with our wishes orvacate the throne.   The latter alternative would be welcome to us.(6) Ali Maher must cease to be Prime Minister. If nahas pasha were unwilling to form a Government, onthe conditions which we thought essential, theBritish authorities would have to govern Egyptunder martial law.(c) The immediate expulsion of the Italian Ministerand his staff was also essential.The Middle 10.   The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatEast. General Wavell had suggested that he should be authorised to getSuggested in touch with the Commander-in-Chief of the East India station,evacuation of regarding the possible evacuation of British women and childrenBritish women from Egypt.   His provisional plan was that they should be sentand children to South Africa via the Red Sea.   It was not known whetherfrom Egypt. General Wavell also contemplated the evacuation of British women and children from Palestine.In discussion the following points were made :  (i) An undue proportion of the smaller vessels in the Navywere already away from their proper duties, on convoywork. It would not be safe to detach any more vesselsfor this duty.(ii) It was very doubtful Whether the plan was feasible on other grounds. The dangers of a passage through theRed Sea were probably at least as great as the dangers of remaining in Egypt.The War Cabinet agreed that women and children shouldnot at present be evacuated from the Middle East.The Par East.Evacuation ofwomen andchildren from hong Kong.11.. The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatwhen, on the 19th June, instructions had been issued forprecautionary measures to be taken in Hong Kong, the GeneralOfficer Commanding had recommended that the maximum numberof white women and children should be evacuated forthwith toManila. The numbers involved were considerable, and it had been thought better that no action should be taken until the ForeignOffice had been consulted. Meanwhile the Governor of Hong Konghad himself taken the view that all the necessary preparations should be made short of actual evacuation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the viewof our Ambassador in China had been that all defence measures should be taken, but that evacuation should not be ordered. Thewhole situation hinged on the attitude of the Japanese. He (theForeign Secretary) had talked to the&quot; Japanese Ambassador on the
previous day and had shown him the report of the interview whichhad taken place between a member of the Japanese General staff and our Military Attache in Tokyo. The Japanese ambassador had been inclined to minimise the importance of this interview, buthe (the Foreign Secretary) had made it clear that we had no option but to accept a message coming from that quarter as a responsiblestatement.Dealing with the general question of Japanese intentions, theForeign Secretary felt that we could not hope for any definitecommitment on the part of the United States as to the help whichthey would give us in the event of hostilities with Japan. Theywould certainly give us no answer to the flat question of whetherthey would be prepared to go to war.In discussion, it was suggested, as an alternative to puttinga direct question to Washington, that we might inform them thatwe had it in mind to withdraw our land forces from Shanghai inthe near future. If the United States Government saw objectionto this course, the onus of asking us to modify our plans would rest with them.The War Cabinet (i) Decided that no evacuation of the civil white population should be made from Hong Kong for the present.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for War to instruct theGeneral Officer Commanding, Hong Kong, to make thenecessary preparations, including the provision ofshipping for the evacuation to Manila of the wives andchildren of Service personnel in the event of evacuationbeing ordered at a later date.Deportation of 12.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatInternees. he had now received answers from Australia and Newfoundland(Previous to the questions which the War Cabinet had asked him on the reference: previous day to put to them.   The Commonwealth Government had.M. (40) 174th replied that they were willing to accept as many internees or conclusions, prisoners as we were in a position to send  to  them.    the minute 8.) Newfoundland Government had replied that they were willing toaccept internees or prisoners up to a total of 1,000.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Japanese inten-tions and thepolicy of theU.S.A.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 173rdConclusions,Minute 7.)Evacuation ofChildren from great Britain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 174thConclusions,Minute 9.)13. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled thatsome uneasiness had been expressed at the meeting of the WarCabinet on the previous day as to the way in which the schemefor evacuating children overseas was proceeding. In actual fact,the official announcement on this subject had been on a distinctlycautious note. It was being brought home to parents that therewas a risk involved in sending their children overseas, which hadto be measured against the risk of allowing them to remain in thiscountry.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
