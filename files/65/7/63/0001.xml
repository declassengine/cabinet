Plans to meet a        1.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a proposalCertain received from the French Government (telegram No. 420 DIPP fromEventuality. Sir R. Campbell).(Previous a. long discussion ensued, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;reference: Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.W.M. (40) 167thConclusions, The main conclusions reached were embodied in telegramsMinute 6.) Nos. 368 and 369 DIPP to Sir R. Campbell.Suggested 2.   In the course of the Meeting two messages were receivedVisit of the      from Sir R. Campbell, supported by another from General Spears,Prime Minister   indicating that M. Reynaud would welcome a meeting with theto France.        Prime Minister in France that afternoon.   The reply sent was thata message was on its way from the Prime Minister to M. Reynaud(see Minute 1) and that the question of a meeting could be consideredlater.Replies toTelegramsReceived fromthe Dominions.3. The Prime Minister referred to telegrams which had beenreceived from each of the Dominions expressing their staunchsupport of the Mother Country in her determination to continuethe struggle. He read out the replies* which had been sent, which met with the warm approval of the War Cabinet.The Dominions.Supply ofmilitaryinformation.(previous references:W.M. (40) 155thConclusions,Minute 7,and 139thConclusions,Minute 3.)Defence ofIreland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 151stConclusions,Minute 13.)4. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs referred torequests made by Mr. Menzies for more detailed information on defence matters. A full reply had now been prepared in response to this request. He felt doubtful, however, whether it would be wise to communicate detailed figures of aircraft losses or production.The War Cabinet agreed : That figures of aircraft losses or production should not becommunicated to the Dominion Prime Ministers.5. The Prime Minister referred to the suggestion containedin General Smuts&apos; telegramt that the Irish Atlantic ports shouldbe occupied at once, even in the face of Irish opposition, in orderto prevent them suffering the same fate as the Norwegian ports.The Lord President of the Council said that he had beenpursuing the question of the security of Ireland for some time. Hehad recently received a report from Sir Charles Tegart which gave a very alarming picture of German preparations in southern ireland, and made it clear that a body of some 2,000 German troops could probably capture the whole country. He had therefore written to Mr. de Valera referring to this information which made it clearthat Ireland was in grave peril. He had suggested that personalconversations between himself and Mr. de Valera were now vitally important and had invited him to come to London for the purpose.He had pointed out that the security of the whole of Ireland was now at stake and that he would arrange, if possible, for lord Craigavon to be present at the interview, as well as theSecretary of State for Dominions.* To New Zealand, No. 154. To Australia, No. 179.To South Africa, No. 218. To Canada, No. 1310.jf No. 304, from United Kingdom High Commissioner in South Africa.[21424a] b 2
He had seen Lord Craigavon some 10 days before and badpointed out to him how difficult it would be to separate questionsof defence from the burning question of partition, and had invited him to consider what conciliatory gesture the people of NorthernIreland would be prepared to make. Lord Craigavon had said thathe would seriously consider this matter, but so far no reply from him had been received. He had since written reproachingLord Craigavon with not replying to his request; informing him of the letter which had been sent to Mr. de Valera; and adding thatif Mr. de Valera accepted the invitation to come to London it was essential that Lord Craigavon should be present.The Lord President went on to explain that he had arranged for his letter to Mr. de Valera to be handed to him personally bySir John Maffey. The latter had reported that de Valera&apos;s firstreaction had been unfavourable. A full report had now beenreceived from which it appeared that Mr. de Valera, when pressed to accept the invitation to go to London, had pointed out the grave difficulties that stood in his way. The visit could not be kept secret,and people would associate it either with matters of defence or withthe question of partition. If matters- of defence were believed tobe under discussion, then suspicions would probably arise, andthe present friendly staff discussions between the two countries mighthave to be broken off. If the question of partition were thought tobe involved, then nothing but the complete disappearance of partition would satisfy the Irish and the ensuing disappointmentwould probably cause the visit to do more harm than good.The Lord President said that he had considered going toIreland himself, but he could not hope to travel unrecognised, andhis visit would cause the same publicity and have the same dis-advantages as a visit by Mr. de Valera to London. He had,therefore, after consulting the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, decided to ask Mr. Malcolm MacDonald to go to Dublin.Mr. MacDonald might hope to pass unrecognised and was on veryfriendly terms with Mr. de Valera. The visit had been arranged,Mr. MacDonald would see Sir Charles Tegart and would fly overto Ireland the next day. He had explained the matter very fully to Mr. MacDonald. It was most important that Mr. de Valerashould be told frankly of the arrangements that the Germans had made. He must realise that it Avould be too late to do anythingafter the invasion had started, when bridges would be blown up toimpede troop movements, and Mr. de Valera himself probably shot.The whole thing might be over in a matter of hours. Adequatedefence precautions must be taken beforehand. What we should like would be if Mr. de Valera would throw neutrality aside and invite British troops to assist in the defence of Ireland; but wecould hardly hope to get his agreement to this. Mr. MacDonaldshould, however, insist on the rounding up of the I.R.A. and the internment of Germans. If this precipitated a rebellion, as itwell might, so much the better. The Eire army would then befighting the I.R.A. and upsetting the German arrangements.At some time during the interview Mr. de Valera would be sureto raise the question of partition. When he did, Mr. MacDonaldwould suggest that a Council for the defence of all Ireland shouldbe set up, which would not only consider matters of defence, but would form a bridge for eventual discussions on partition. if mr. de Valera could be persuaded to accept this proposition, thenMr. MacDonald was to go on and see Lord Craigavon and persuade him to accept it also.The suggestion of sending French or Polish troops to Eire couldbe put to Mr. de^ Valera by Mr. MacDonald, but there was not much chance of him agreeing to it.The Lord President added that unless the Admiralty wantedinstant action with regard to the Atlantic ports, he was most
Public Opinion 6.   The Secretary of State for War said that he had seen aand the Press, report prepared for the Ministry of Information on the state ofpublic opinion up and down the country. This report was notvery encouraging. Bearing in mind the stern times ahead of us,he would like to have seen a firmer note of resolution in the peopleof this country.In the discussion which ensued, reference was made to theattitude of the Press. While on the whole the attitude of the press had been helpful, it was unfortunate that there was a certaintendency to encourage inquests rather than to concentrate on the tasks ahead. It was important that steps should be taken to makethe Press realise that demands for inquests could only engender&quot; A&quot; a spirit of doubt as to our strength, and that such demands oughttherefore to be sternly discouraged.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he intendedto make a statement in the House on Tuesday, which he would follow up by a broadcast on Tuesday night.The War Cabinet-Invited the attention of the Minister of Information to theviews indicated at &quot; A &quot; above.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 167thConclusions,Minute 7.)Air attack onBergen.7. The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff said that there had been little fighter activity on the previous day on either side. Nocontacts had been made. Projected bomber operations had been abandoned owing to the weather.Twelve Wellingtons had been despatched from an aerodromein South France to attack Turin, but owing to bad weather onlyone aircraft had reached the objective. No report had yet beenreceived.Two direct hits had been obtained by a Coastal command aircraft on a U-boat off Cape Wrath.Shipping, docks and a rail-head had been bombed at Bergen.An ammunition dump had been destroyed, but other results weredoubtful.Three Hudson aircraft which had been despatched to attackStavanger Aerodrome had failed to return.One of our aircraft which had been engaged in operations overTrondhjem was missing.anxious to give Mr. de Valera a chance of agreeing to the settingup of the proposed Council. Action against the Atlantic portsnow might well force Mr. de Valera&apos;s army into co-operation withthe I.R.A.The Prime Minister welcomed Mr. MacDonald&apos;s proposed visit to Mr. de Valera and agreed that, although as a last resort weshould not hesitate to secure the ports by force, it would be unwiseat this moment to take any action that might compromise ourposition with the United States of America, in view of the presentdelicate developments.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the arrangements made by the Lord Presidentof the Council for the visit to Ireland of Mr. Malcolm Macdonald.(b) Agreed that no action should be taken in regard to theoccupation of the Irish Atlantic Ports, pending theresults of this visit.
The squadrons of Battles which had formed part of the british air Force in France had returned &quot;from France on the previous afternoon. The Fighters would remain as long as possible in orderto protect the evacuation. Refuelling arrangements had been madein the Channel Islands.The Belgian Prime Minister and fifty members of his staff hadbeen brought to this country by air from Nantes.Operations in Italian aircraft had bombed Aden aerodrome without causingMiddle East.      any loss.   An Italian raid on Malta dockyard had caused little damage.Bombers of the South African Air Force had successfully attacked an Italian aerodrome and obtained hits on a barracks.The aircraft used in this raid were Junkers 86.In reply to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff confirmed that,in his view, any available Hurricanes should be sent to Alexandria,rather than to Malta, where there would be no adequate facilitiesfor maintaining them.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Naval 8.   The Chief of Naval Staff said that H.M. armed merchantSituation. cruiser Andania had been torpedoed and sunk on the previous night(Previous on the northern patrol.Reference:W.M. (40) 167thConclusions,Minute 4.)Arrival of The Australian and New Zealand convoy would arrive duringAustralian and the course of the day. One thousand Canadians would also reachNew Zealand    Reykjavik (Iceland).convoy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 151stConclusions,Minute 6.)Attacks on Two Greek ships had been sunk by submarines off Spain.   Antrade. Italian submarine was thought to be operating in this area, inaddition to a German U-boat.Attacks on There had been several successful or hopeful attacks on ItalianItalian submarines.  On the 13th June H.M. Australian Destroyer Voyagersubmarines. had sunk an Italian submarine off Alexandria; on the 14th Junethree destroyers had attacked another submarine off Alexandriawith hopeful results; a third submarine had been sunk off Malta;and a damaged submarine had been reported alongside a pier atCeuta-this was probably the submarine which had been attackedafter firing a torpedo at one of our destroyers.The Prime Minister suggested that the Admiralty should announce that we had sunk a number of Italian submarines.The Chief of Naval Staff said that the Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, had reported that, although one Italian aircraft had been sighted, no attempt appeared to have been made to shadowthe Mediterranean fleet in its recent sweep. It had been reported from Malta that Italian aircraft had sheered off as soon as ourGladiators were sighted.
9 \ 3The MilitarySituation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 167thConclusions,Minute 3.)The western front;tVisit of general de Gaulle.Evacuation of the B.E.F. from the base ports was proceedingwell. One regiment of artillery (24 guns) had already beenembarked with their equipment at Cherbourg. Two more regimentswere in process of being embarked. Every effort would be made tobring off as much ammunition as possible, but, owing to the widedispersal of the ammunition dumps, it was unlikely that any verylarge quantity could be brought off.The Secretary of State for War reported that he had seenGeneral de Gaulle, who had passed through Britanny in order toexamine the possibility of holding a bridgehead there. It had been explained to General de Gaulle that both General Weygand andGeneral Georges did not regard the project as feasible. In anycase, it did not cover Nantes, and at least 10 divisions would berequired to hold it. These troops were not available. General de gaulle had been informed that it had been arranged with GeneralBrooke to evacuate from Cherbourg any French troops who wouldbe willing to come away with ours.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,June 16, 1940.9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there appeared to be little pressure on the Allied forces West of Paris.Our troops were conforming to the retirement of the French10th Army. The German drive to the East of Paris appeared tohave reached as far as Dijon and Alencon, which showed that matters were developing very rapidly in this area.
