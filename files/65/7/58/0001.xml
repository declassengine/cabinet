435 W.M.163 (40).The Air 1.   The Chief of the Air Staff summarised the informationSituation. concerning Air Operations given to the War Cabinet that morning.(Previous V Whitley bombers had succeeded in attacking the Fiat works atEeference: Turin, and 3 had attacked targets at Genoa. It had now been.M.

Reynaud and general weygand had agreed to the air operation being carried out against targets in Northern Italy by R.A.F aircraft starting from aero-dromes in France, as well as from aerodromes in this country.Nevertheless, General Vuillemin had, on his own initiative, stoppedthe Wellingtons in France from getting off the aerodrome.Evidently the French feared Italian reprisals. It was also reportedthat the French and Italian troops were fraternising at the Col deLarche. It was clear that any further air attacks on Italy wouldhave to be carried out from aerodromes in this country. As soonas the scattered aircraft had returned to this country, we shouldrepeat the operation, and it would be wise to do this without delay.The Chief of the Air Staff explained that attacks on northern italy from this country could not be carried out with regularity.The War Cabinet agreed : (1) That the Secretary of State for Air should report to theWar Cabinet when he was in a position to repeat theair attack on targets in North Italy.(2) That the press reports of the attack carried out on theprevious-night should make it clear that the attack hadbeen carried out from aerodromes in this country.The western front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 162ndConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff described thesituation on the Western Front. He had, with the consent of thePrime Minister, agreed to General Weygand&apos;s request that British reinforcements as they became available should be put into the battlebrigade by brigade and should not wait until a whole division hadbeen concentrated. He had, however, pressed General Weygandto do everything possible to constitute a British force under GeneralBrooke as quickly as possible. The 52nd Division had now arrived in France and the first echelon of the Canadian Division would begin to arrive that night. It would take about three days before the firstbrigade of the Canadians could be concentrated.The First Sea Lord said that it had not been possible to getships in to take off the 51st Division the previous night owing tofog. There were still ships lying off the coast, however, to evacuateany men who might still be able to get away.The Prime Minister said that the British Command-ers in theHavre peninsula must not accept any further orders from theFrench, who had let us down badly- They had not allowed the51st Division to retire on Rouen, and had then kept it waiting until it was no longer possible for it to reach Havre; finally, they hadcompelled it to capitulate with their own troops. Any remainingtroops must be evacuated from Havre that night without fail.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to ensurethat this was made clear to the Commanders concerned.[21407b]b 2
Supreme War 3.   The Prime Minister then gave the War Cabinet a reportCouncil. of nis meeting with M. Reynaud, Marshal Petain and General(Previous Weygand.   They had been studiously polite and dignified, but itEeference: was clear that Prance was near the end of organised resistance.C^nciustons161St        General Weygand had first made his report and this had been minute 11 &apos;      later corroborated by General Georges in almost identical terms,nu e .)        ^e main p0ints of General Weygand&apos;s report had been asfollows : (i) The French armies had been fighting for six days, night and day, and were now almost completely exhausted.In some places two divisions were holding 120 kilometresof front and some divisions had been reduced to a strength of two battalions. The enemy seemed to haveovermatched and outwitted them altogether. TheFrench had some 65 divisions in all, of which 40 hadtaken the brunt of the enemy&apos;s attack, into which hehad put some 120 divisions in addition to armoured forces.(ii) The enemy&apos;s armoured forces had caused great disorganisation-tion among the headquarters of the Higher formations.General Weygand, himself, had been at Tenth ArmyHeadquarters when, after receiving reports of the closeapproach of the enemy, the headquarters had suddenlycome under shell fire. These large formation head-quarters were very unwieldy to move and when on the move could not exercise any proper control over lowerformations.(iii) The French army was now on its last line, which hadalready been penetrated, but not decisively, in two orthree places. If the French had twenty fresh divisionsavailable for a counter-attack they might turn the scale,since the enemy forward troops were at the end of theirtether, too. But the Germans had fresh formationsfollowing on behind, whereas the Allies had no reservesat all.(iv) General Weygand expressed the opinion that the allies had entered upon the war very lightly without makingthe necessary preparations. No proper estimate hadbeen made of the enormous strength of the enemy, whohad added some 55 divisions and 3,000 to 4,000 tanks tohis forces since the outbreak of war.(v) The present position of the French forces was the last onwhich he would attempt to - offer an organised andco-ordinated resistance. If it collapsed, he would notbe responsible for any attempt to carry on the struggle,but would be willing to serve under any other officer if required.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that General de Gaulle,who was sitting with M. Reynaud, was all in favour of carrying ona guerrilla warfare. He was young and energetic and had made avery favourable impression. He did not believe in a &quot; war offronts &quot; and thought that new methods must be adopted. It seemed probable that, if the present line collapsed, M. Reynaud would turn to General de Gaulle to take command.M. Reynaud had said that Marshal Petain had quite made up his mind that peace must be made with the Germans. His view wasthat all France was being systematically destroyed by the germans and that it was his duty to save the rest of the country from thisfate. He had gone so far as to write a memorandum on the subject,which he had shown to M. Reynaud, but had not left it with him.There could be no doubt that Marshal Petain was a dangerous manat this juncture; he had always been a defeatist, even in the last war.
The Prime Minister said that he had put certain questions tothe French as follows : -(a) Would not the large built-up area of Paris form a goodcentre of resistance to the advance of the enemy&apos;s tanks,like Madrid?General Weygand had replied that he had already informed the Paris deputies that the city would be declared an open townand that no attempt at resistance would be made in it. It was full of defenceless people and he could not see it destroyed by Germanbombardment.(b) Was there not a chance of making a counter-attack acrossthe Lower Seine to cut in on to the German communica-tions leading towards Paris? We might be able togather together some eight or nine divisions within aweek or so, if we put in the French Chasseurs Alpinsand the British troops from Narvik, the 52nd Division,the Canadian Division and the 3rd Division, whichwould be ready in this country about the 20th. Therewere also two French Divisions which were beingreconstituted in the area.General Weygand had replied that the conception was soundstrategically, but the question was whether they could hold out long enough to collect the reserves for this counter-attack. He evidentlyhad not thought so himself and it was on these grounds that theChief of the Imperial General Staff had been authorised to agreeto put in the British reinforcements piece-meal by brigades as theyarrived.(c) If the period of co-ordinated defence came to an end, would it not be possible to carry on a &quot; war of columns &apos;&apos; ?This would force the Germans to expend a very largenumber of troops in combating these tactics, and might enable the French to hold out until the United Statescame into the war on our side.General Weygand had replied that he did not himself feel thatit would be possible for the French to hold out so long, but he had repeated that he would be willing to serve under any other general who would undertake the task of command.The Prime Minister. said that M. Reynaud seemed quitedetermined to fight on, and Admiral Darlan had declaredemphatically that he would never surrender the French Navy to theenemy. In the last resort, he would send it over to Canada.Nevertheless, there was, of course, the danger that he might beoverruled by the politicians.The Prime Minister had emphasised to the French that, ifthere was any grave deterioration in the situation on which they felt they had to take decisions of great moment, we must beinformed immediately and given an opportunity to consult withthem before such decisions were taken.Some discussion then took place as to how the Germansmanaged to keep such a tremendous offensive effort going withoutrelaxation.The Prime Minister said that for six years they had beenpreparing their offensive war, and the whole Army was imbued withthe spirit to press forward at all costs.The Secretary of State for War said that the French had explained to him that, whereas in the last war an advance wascarried out behind a barrage to a certain depth, and then there hadto be a halt while the artillery was moved forward, in this war theaction of the dive-bombers and the tanks together enabled the momentum of the attack to be continuously sustained. It was thiswhich had thrown into confusion the defensive plans of the French.
The effect of the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to the French Govern-ment had been remarkable; and, whereas they had at first appearedas men who had abandoned hope, they were now inspired to bendtheir minds to see what could be done if their line were broken.The chief danger to the continuance of French resistance was thefact that, apart from Marshal Petain, whose attitude was defeatist,there was no personality in M. Reynaud&apos;s Cabinet. Thus theFrench politicians in favour of coming to an understanding withthe Germans might find themselves strong enough to overthrowM. Reynaud. Although no reproaches had been levelled at ourheads, the French showed clearly that they regarded our military effort as small, and remarked that wre had only put one-quarter toone-third of our Fighter Force into the battle. Out of such thoughtsan anti-British feeling might easily be worked up. On the otherhand, General Howard Vyse was firmly of the opinion that theFrench would fight on. Nevertheless, he (the Secretary of State)thought that the one factor which might decide the French tocontinue to fight would be some decisive step by the United Statesof America, such as the breaking off of diplomatic relations withGermany.  M. Reynaud had emphasised the importance of this.The Prime Minister said that he had promised to send afurther message to the President of the United States, placingbefore him clearly the present situation.Continuing, the Secretary of State for War said that theFrench would shortly be having a decisive Cabinet meeting, atwhich M. Reynaud&apos;s hand would be greatly strengthened if he could say that he had an assurance from the British War Cabinet that,however the war might develop, we would continue to stand by france; that we should never desert her, and would go to theuttermost to recover all that France had lost.Discussion then turned upon the part played by the air in thebattles in France. The Lord President of the Council enquire whether, if we had thrown in the whole of our fighter resourcesregardless of our own safety, the battle would thereby have beenwon. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was emphatic thatthis was not so. The disparity in numbers after the loss of the armies of the North, and the efforts of the German armoured divisions, would still have been too much for the French. Therewas undoubtedly a feeling in the French Army that we had not given them adequate support, though a good deal of this feeling was in the nature of an excuse to cover themselves. It might,however, be easily worked up.The Secretary of State for War quoted extracts from thediscussion which had taken place at the meeting in France, in which m. Reynaud and General Weygand had emphasised the decisiveeffect of air power, and had expressed the view that a great attack by the Allied air forces which was the only reserve left to theAllied Governments might even now turn the scale.The Prime Minister said that he could not believe that thiswas so, but he had nevertheless promised that the War cabinet would earnestly consider what air support we could give, and wouldcertainly not in any way lessen the amount which had hitherto beengiven.The Secretary of State for War enquired whether a consider-able psychological effect might not be achieved if the Royal AirForce in some way could make their presence visible to the french troops on extensive areas of the front.The Prime Minister thought that this could at any rate be doneby action on the Lower Seine, from which the most dangerous attack was developing, and where it would be worth while making ourgreatest effort.  Summing up the position, he thought that a chapter
The channel islands.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 162ndConclusions,Minute 10.)4. The Secretary of State for war said that the War cabinet had been informed at their meeting that morning that the Chiefsof Staff were making arrangements to send two battalions for thedefence of the Channel Islands. He would like to reconsider thematter in the light of the new situation, and would put his views before the War Cabinet.in the war was now closing. The French might continue thestruggle; there might even be two French Governments, one which made peace, and one which organised resistance in the colonies and with the Fleet, and carried on a guerilla warfare it was too early yet to tell; but effective resistance as a great land Power was coming to an end. We must now concentrate everything on thedefence of this island, though for a period we might still have tosend a measure of support to France. He viewed the new phasewith confidence. A declaration that we were firmly resolved tocontinue the war in all circumstances would prove the best invitation to the United States of America to lend us their support. We should maintain the blockade, and win through, though at the cost of ruinand starvation throughout Europe. In the meanwhile, the flow ofour forces to France must continue, and the Air Staff must consider how great an effort we could put in during the following two orthree days to support the battle.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs enquired whether he should reveal the situation in full to the Dominion high commissioners that evening. Some of them were inclined to regardevents from a pessimistic angle, but we could correct any impressionthey might convey to their Governments by means of our ownmessages to the Dominion Prime Ministers through our high commissioners in the Dominions.It was generally agreed that in such important matters it was essential to make the Dominions realise that we were taking themfully into our confidence, and that the situation should thereforebe frankly communicated to the High Commissioners.The War Cabinet :-(i) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to reinforce, through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in France,the request made by the Prime Minister to M. Reynaud,and accepted by him; namely, that if there were a gravedeterioration in the situation and before the FrenchGovernment took any decisive action, they would informus, so that frank and full consultation could take place,(ii) Invited the Prime Minister to send a message to president roosevelt, giving him a full picture of the presentsituation and possible developments.(iii) Took note that the Prime Minister would draft a messagefor despatch to the French Government, designed to sustain their determination, and to assure them of ourunwavering support in all circumstances.(iv) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to examine theextent of air support which could be given to the land battle in the ensuing days, and to inform the PrimeMinister who would communicate this information tothe French Government-(v) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform the Dominion High Commissioners forthwith ofthe situation, and of possible developments,(vi) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to take steps tosecure the transfer of German air crews captured by theFrench to safe custody in the United Kingdom.
Turkey. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was asked if heAction in had any further information as to Turkey.   He said that on the consequence of previous day he had seen the Turkish Ambassador who had saidItalian that Turkey would do what was right, but would act with a certaindeclaration of prudence. He had gathered that this meant that Turkey intendedwar. to enquire of Bulgaria whether she would maintain neutrality; and(Previous would then consult Yugoslavia and Greece as to their attitude.  the reference:        Foreign Secretary had pointed out that these enquiries might takeW.M.

It was explained that opinion in the House had seemedrather divided on the question whether a Secret Session should beheld in the ensuing week. While there was some demand for sucha Session, other Members were opposed to it.The Prime Minister thought that for the next day or so no definite reply should be given to enquiries whether a Secret sessions should be held on, say, Thursday, the 20th June. Soundings couldbe made and a definite answer given in two or three days&apos; time.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 12, 1940.
