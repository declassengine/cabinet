377W.M. 15S (40).1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theFrench Government had now replied to the inquiry which we had addressed to them on this matter. They had agreed that we shouldtake action to stop Italian ships carrying provocative cargoes of key war materials. They had added that they would prefer thatwe should base our action on Italy&apos;s unilateral interruption of conversations on blockade matters, which compelled us to resumeour belligerent rights, rather than on the indications we had received that Italy was about to enter the war.The Foreign Secretary said that the conclusion reached by theWar Cabinet on this matter on the 2nd June had not perhaps made it clear on which of these two grounds we intended to act. he understood that the Minister of Economic Warfare was ratherdisposed to take the view that we should base our action on Italy&apos;declaration of her intention to enter the war. The Foreign office were, on the whole, disposed to think that it would be better that weshould base our action on a resumption of belligerent rights of contraband control, for the following reasons : First, the view takenby the French Government which he had already reported; secondly,that we wanted to be sure that, if we got into war with Italy,Turkey came into the war on our side. If it could be argued that war between this country and Italy had arisen as the result of someact of aggression on our part, this might give Turkey an excuse to stand aside.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that, provided action was taken to stop all the ships in the list which he had sent to theForeign Office and to the Admiralty, he was not concerned with thepretext used to justify stopping them. He wished, however, to put it on record that he was advised that, apart altogether fromcontraband control, we should be justified in stopping these ships asa measure of restraint, in view of Italy&apos;s declared hostile intentions.Looking at the matter from the point of view of contraband control,he was prepared to deploy a statistical argument to show that italy had already imported more than her normal annual import require-riients of the articles in question in the previous five months.In further discussion, the following points were made : (1) Two of the ships were carrying manganese ore, which were quired for our own purposes.(2) The proper course was that orders should be given to pickup these ships and bring them into port for contraband control purposes. The procedure in regard to contraband control could, no doubt, be spun out. It was clear,however, that, if we continued to bring into port forcontraband control purposes all the ships on this list, wewere almost certain to find ourselves in trouble with italy.(3) If and when the Italian Government asked us why we werestopping these ships, we should explain that we had hadto revert to our previous contraband control procedureon account of what had happened in the interval sincethe new procedure had been proposed.(4) Italy might not stop at strong protests if we stopped allthe ships on the list submitted by the Minister ofEconomic Warfare. She might decide to start escortingher merchantmen with warships. If she adopted thiscourse, we should have to make it quite plain that wewere determined to exei^cise our belligerent rights of contraband control. The Italian Government had no right to escort merchantmen with warships. If theyused force to prevent us exercising our belligerent rightsof contraband control, they would be the aggressors, andwe should use what force was necessary to exercise ourrights.[21386]&apos; B 2Contrabandcontrol.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 154thConclusions,Minute 6.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 152ndConclusions,Minute 4.)
(5) The right course was that the necessary instructions shouldbe given to bring in the ships concerned for contraband control, but that no preliminary warning should be givento the Italian Government.The War Cabinet agreed (a) That Italian merchant ships carrying provocative cargoes of key war materials to Italy, as shown on the listsubmitted to the Foreign Office and the Admiralty bythe Minister of Economic Warfare, should be interceptedand made subject to contraband control.(b) That this action should be based on the exercise of ourbelligerent rights of contraband control, and not on the indications received that Italy was likely to enter the war.(c) that no prior warning should be given to the Italian Govern-ment of the action proposed.(d) That the Admiralty should give instructions that themerchantmen and tankers on the list in question shouldbe intercepted and made subject to contraband control,even if escorted by Italian war vessels.italy- 2.   The  Secretary  of  State  for  Fo reign  A ffairs  referredTiie case of the to telegram No. 440 from Cairo, reporting that an ItalianS.S. Vmbria. merchantman, the S.S. Umbria, had arrived at Port Said, southwardbound, with an alleged cargo of 5,000 tons ;of bombs, 15 tons ofdetonators, and 1,750 tons of cement. This telegram had also reported that it was intended to arrange matters so that the Canalwould be blocked for 48 hours.A later telegram, however, had been received from Cairo(No. 446) reporting that at 10 p.m. on the previous night the ship had been near Kantara. It was possible that she had been detainedat Suez. Assuming, however, as seemed probable, that the S.S.Umbria had passed through the. Canal, the question remainedwhether she should be intercepted before reaching Massawa.In discussion the following points were raised :- (1) The Foreign Secretary said that contraband control couldnot be invoked in regard to this ship. Any attempt to detain this ship was a direct act of war against Italy.(2) The Minister for Economic Warfare said he was advised that the detention of this ship, could be justified in inter-national law as a measure of restraint in self-defence,falling short of an act of war.(3) It was obviously undesirable to let this cargo reachMassawa, seeing that Italy might any day enter the war against us.(4) It might be argued that Signor Mussolini would come intothe war at whatever moment best suited his own plans,and that the seizure of this ship was not likely to exercise&apos;a determining influence one way or the other on his decision.(5) It was felt, however, that the real issue in this case was whether, on balance, it was better to let this ship through,or to give Signor Mussolini the pretext, for which he wasno doubt looking, of coming into the war on the groundthat we had committed an unprovoked act of aggression against him. He would, no doubt, argue that it wasintolerable that a ship should be stopped by the Britishwhen proceeding from Italy to the Italian Empire; andthis might enable him to whip up Italian public opinionagainst us.   Again, it was undesirable that the French
should be able to say that we had given Signor Mussolinia pretext for coming into the war. Finally, from thepoint of view of American public opinion, it was important that Italy&apos;s entry into the war should be clearly shown in its true light with no redeemingcircumstance.(6) The Chief of Air Staff, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, and the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff in reply to questions expressed the view that the balance ofadvantage was against stopping this ship at the present justice.The War Cabinet agreed : (a) That at present no instructions should be issued to stop the S.S. Umbria.(b) That the Admiralty should  issue orders for the  S.S.Umbria to be discreetly shadowed in her voyage down the Red Sea, and for a suitable warship to be availableto intercept her.(c) That the position in regard to the S.S. Umbria should be reviewed from day to day, in the light of the indications of Italy&apos;s probable intentions.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 154thConclusions,Minute 3.)Air operations,4th/5th June.Air attack onParis, 3rd June.3. The Chief of the Air Staff said that we had lost one aircraft and brought down one enemy aircraft on the previous day.Bomber Command had carried out a number of night attacks againstoil targets in Germany. Full reports had not been received, butconsiderable successes had been reported..In reply to a question by the Lord President of the Council, theChief of the Air Staff said that he saw no reason to regard theGerman air attack on Paris two days before as having achieved anygreater accuracy of bombing than we should hope to achieve undersimilar conditions. While most of the attacks had been carried out from a high altitude, some of the attacks had come in at a considerably lower level.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The western front.Frenchdispositions.(previous reference:W.M.

The Prime Minister said that he had received a letter fromGeneral Spears reporting on the French dispositions and on theFrench organisation for meeting tank attacks. The number ofFrench Divisions on the Somme-Aisne front was now considerablylarger than trie number previously reported to us.In regard to anti-tank weapons, reference was made to a Frenchrequest for British anti-tank rifles, which the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff undertook to investigate.The French had made further requests for air help. The PrimeMinister said that he was examining these requests with the Chiefsof Staff.News had been received that a German attack had been launched that morning on a 70-mile front, extending from Amiensto the Laon-Soissons road.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that this attacklooked like a drive towards Paris. The thrust towards Rheims,which the French had expected, had not materialised at present.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that an attack had been carried out south of Abbeville on the previous day, with
Calais.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 147thConclusions,Minute .1.)The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M.

The attack, inwhich -a British brigade had taken part, had met with some initialsuccess. Later, there had been a German counter-attack, and someof the ground gained had been lost. The French had had heavy tanklosses owing to mines and anti-tank guns. There was no sign of aGerman attack west of Amiens that morning.A further reconnaissance had been made of Calais, but no sign of life had been seen in the Citadel.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.5. The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said that there was still anumber of small craft in the channel. Air reconnaissance was beingcarried out, and a number of small vessels had been brought in.Seven Dutch submarines were now operating with our Fleet.Attacks had been carried out on 2 U-boats north of Kinnaird&apos;sHead.  It was believed that one hit had been scored.A magnetic mine of a new type, which might represent a massproduction compromise between two existing types, had been dropped on the French coast and removed for examination.U-13 had been located off Orfordness. Divers were being sentdown.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Norway. 6.   A further discussion took place on the situation in Norway.(Previous A record of the discussion, and of the conclusions reached, isReference: contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet.M.

The War Cabinet had before them a Paper by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (40) 192) which may besummarised as follows :  (i) General approval was asked to the principle that dominion Governments should be given continuously thefullest possible information which would enable them torealise the general situation as it existed at the time andthe future probabilities so far as they could be gauged,(ii) This need could be met if, whenever any paper on themilitary aspects of the war was brought before the WarCabinet, dealing with a subject of general interest to theDominions, or of interest to some particular Dominion,the substance were communicated to the Prime ministers of the Dominions for their secret and personal information.How much of any such paper should be communicatedshould be settled by the Military Liaison Officer of theDominions Office and the War Cabinet Secretariat, whowould consult the Departments concerned in any case of doubt.In short discussion, emphasis was laid on the importance of the&quot; A &quot;     approval of the Service Departments being obtained in all importantcases to the text of any such communications.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, as summarised above, subject to &quot; A.&quot;(iii)Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 5, 1940.
