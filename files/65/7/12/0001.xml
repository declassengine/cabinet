Situation 1.   The Chiefs of Staff in turn gave reports of operationsReports. carried out in the previous 21 hours.   (For details see the summariesof operations prepared by the Service Departments, and the DailySummaries of Information.)Removal of The First Sea Lord said that two of the three ships sent toHollands gold. Holland to load gold from Amsterdam had sailed and should reachthis country that evening. The third ship was now being loaded.The position in regard to the gold at Rotterdam was uncertain. Itwas feared that a pilot steamer, on which it had been attempted to send gold down the river from Rotterdam to the Black Swan,had been sunk by a magnetic mine.Dutch shipping. Attempts were being made by our Naval Attache to get shippingaway from Rotterdam.Operations in The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that two reportsNorway. had been received of parachute troops being dropped by the enemy in Northern Norway.Royal Marine The Prime Minister said that the Royal Marine Operation hadOperation. been started.  The first of the fluvial mines ought to reach Mannheimin the course of that afternoon.TheNetherlands.Asylum for theex-Kaiser.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 113thConclusions,Minute 5.)B.E.F.Proposed move of the firstarmoureddivision toFrance.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hewas consulting The King as to whether we should offer the ex-Kaiserrefuge in this country. Subject to The King&apos;s approval, he was proposing to inform our Minister at The Hague that he might indicate that we should be prepared to offer the ex-Kaiser refugein this country.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that lord Gort was asking that the Armoured Division should be despatched to France. Without this Division, Lord Gort had noforce suitable for a counter-attack. If the Armoured Divisionwent to France, we should still have 160 light tanks in this country.Further, it was proposed to organise 12 troops of tanks of variousdescriptions, which, although not suitable for operations in France,would be very useful to deal with the contingency of invasion ofthis country. The Third Corps, which included the canadian division, were now fit for operations. Two motorised battalions and one motor-cycle battalion would also be kept in this country.It was agreed To authorise the move of the Armoured Division to France.Invasion of 4.   The Prime Minister raised the question whether the PoliceGreat Britain. should be armed.Arming of General Ismay was instructed to take up this point with thePolice. Minister of Home Security and the Secretary of State for War.Internment of The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, in enemy aliens in the light of the possibility of invasion, it was very desirable thatthe Eastern all enemy aliens in counties on the South-East and East (fromcounties. Hampshire to Nairn) should be interned.  No doubt 90 per cent, ofsuch aliens were well disposed to this country, but it was impossibleto pick out the small proportion of aliens who probably constituted a dangerous element. In the circumstances, the only course seemedto be that all aliens in this area should be interned for the present.The number was probably 4,000 or 5,000.
The Home Secretary, who had been consulted, said that if thecourse was pressed on military grounds he would agree to it.It was agreed That the Home Secretary should be authorised to issue instructions for the internment of all male enemy aliensaged 16 to 60 in the area mentioned above, and for theimposition of severe restrictions on non-enemy aliens of thesame age. The continuance of this measure should besubject to review when the situation appeared lessthreatening.TheNetherlands.Protection of oil refineries atAruba andCuracao.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 119thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The First Sea Lord said that a telegram had been receivedfrom our Consul at Aruba saying that the Dutch authorities hadthe situation well in hand, and that the despatch of British troopsmight not be well received. The despatch of troops had, therefore,been countermanded.The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs said that on theprevious day he had agreed with the Dutch Minister that we should send troops, and the text of various documents as to the despatchof these troops had been settled. It seemed that there had been some misunderstanding between the Foreign Office and theAdmiralty over this matter, and the Foreign Secretary proposedthat this matter should be taken up between these two Departments.This was agreed to.Air Action. 6.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that thereAnticipated       was reason to anticipate bombing attacks in the near future onbombing attacks towns on the North and North-East Coast, possibly launched fromon towns on the Norway.   Due warning had been given to the Civil Authorities.North and north-East _Coast.Sweden. 7.   The Prime Minister referred to the probable effect on publicopinion in Sweden of the invasion of Holland and Belgium. was it not worth while to try to make Sweden realise that germany had no regard for the interests of small nations ? If Swedencould be induced to come into the war on our side, the whole positionin Scandinavia would be changed.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to put this point forcibly to the Swedish Minister, but without much hopethat it would affect Sweden&apos;s attitude.Next Meeting.8.   It was agreed to meet again at 10 p.m. that night.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 11, 1940.
