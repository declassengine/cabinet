The Secretary of State for Air said that four enemy tracksSituation. had been plotted during the previous day off the British and Dutch(Previous coasts and, during the night, 30 tracks in the areas of the Tyne,Eeferenoe: Tees, the Humber, and near Dunkirk.

The Secretary of State for Air said that a very large numberof our machines had been engaged during the previous 24 hours and all had returned safely.Stavanger There had been two attacks on Stavanger aerodrome during the aerodrome. previous day, each by six Blenheims; neither attack had encounteredenemy opposition. In the first attack bursts had been seen on theedge of the aerodrome, and in the second bombs had been seen toburst on the runway. About 80 enemy aircraft were dispersed on and around the aerodrome, but full reports were not yet available.Six Whitleys had also attacked this aerodrome; three had completed their task, but reports had not yet been received from the others.Two Hudsons of Coastal Command had bombed the same objectiveobserving hits on one of the runways.Fornebu and Six Hampdens had attacked Aalborg aerodrome and fiveAalborg Whitleys had bombed the aerodrome at Fornebu.aerodromes.Mine-laying Nine Hampdens had been engaged in mine-laying operationsoperations.        and four had successfully completed their task.   One had been attacked by enemy aircraft near Terschelling, and one had shot down an enemy seaplane North-West of Norderney.Coastal Patrols by Blenheim fighters had been maintained in the command.        Andalsnes area.   Three Blenheims had attacked a Heinkel and aJunker 88 over Romsdals Fjord, but both enemy aircraft had escaped.Attacks on Several attacks on enemy submarines had been reported.U-boats.Eeports of Aircraft from the Bomber Command had seen a ship of aboutenemy warships 8,000 tons two miles north of Norderney, a, ship of 10,000 to 15,000and shipping.     tons stationary off Schillig, arid a ship of 15,000 tons in the mouth of the Weser.A Hudson engaged on a reconnaissance of the Elbe area, had reported sighting one aircraft carrier, 3 cruisers and 3 destroyers20 miles North of Borkum on an easterly course at 9-55 a.m. ; one large vessel on a southerly course 4 miles East of this force at10-33 a.m.; and two large vessels of about 25,000 tons, one smallervessel, and one escort vessel, in position 5 miles North of Wangeroog,steering West at 10 knots at 10-20 a.m. Bombs had been droppedwithout result. A subsequent reconnaissance had reported other vessels in a position 5 miles North-West of Borkum at 4-8 p.m. onan easterly course; another vessel of about 4,000 tons some 3 milesfurther west on a south-easterly course; and a Swedish tanker about20 miles West of Borkum on an easterly course, but had seen nothing of the aircraft carrier and cruisers reported previously. Patrols tocover the Dutch coast and Ems, Jade and Elbe estuaries had been dispatched at dawn on 2nd May.Some discussion followed as to the inference to be drawn fromthese observations. The vessels which had been seen might bemoving towards the Dutch Islands; or they might be using theNorth Sea route to reach Oslo, following a round-about course inorder to avoid mine-fields in the Belts. There had been someconfusion in the reports received, ships which had been reported as transports having turned out to be, in fact, trawlers; but it waspointed out that it was difficult to believe that our aircraft hadbeen mistaken in their reports of having seen big ships, e.g., of25,000 tons.[21246] b 2
The First Lord of the A dmiralty undertook to make enquires as to exactly what reports had been received in the Admiralty onthe previous day as a result of these air reconnaissances, and what action had been taken.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The naval situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 109thConclusions,Minute 2.)Effects ofBritishmine-laying.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 104thConclusions,Minute 2.)H.M. SubmarineUnity.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that as a result of mine laying by enemy aircraft (see Minute 1), Blyth, the Humberand Dunkirk had been closed to shipping. Harwich had been opened. Not many enemy mines were being exploded, as attention was being concentrated on keeping the war channels clear.The Minister without Portfolio pointed out that these closureswere not complete, as ships which had been degaussed were stillable to proceed.According to a Dutch report, wrecks of two ships, apparentlyGerman merchant ships sunk by mines, had been seen at the entrance to the river Ems.Diving operations had begun on H.M. submarine Unity which,as had been reported on the previous day, had sunk as a resultof a collision off the Fame Islands. The few men remaining in hercould only be saved, however, if they made their own escape by using the Davies apparatus.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Operations in norway.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 109thConclusions,Minute 3.)Narvik area.NorwegianRoyal FamilyandGovernment.Andalsnes area.3.   The War Cabinet were given the following information (i) We were continuing to harass the Germans in Narvik withfire from our ships. Our troops from the AnkanesPeninsula had had some skirmishes with the enemy, andit was hoped that we should soon be able to cross andblock the railway between Narvik and the frontier. our operations had been slowed down in the hopes that weshould in this way be able to cut off the German force from any possibility of retreat.(ii) Naval Base Headquarters at Harstad had been hit by a bomb and two ratings killed. Bombs had also fallenclose to a hospital ship which was lying quite apart, andthere was an uncertain report to the effect that a norwegian hospital ship had also been hit.(iii) The King of Norway and his Government had beentransferred to the Norwegian ship Beimdal in theMalanger Fjord on the previous evening, and it was understood that he intended to remain in the Tromsoarea though not in Tromso itself. It would be for theNorwegian Government to advise what they would liketo be said about his movements, e.g., whether they wouldlike us to deny the German reports that he was coming toEngland and to say that he was remaining in Norway.(iv) Andalsnes had been bombed intermittently during theprevious day, and H.M. ships Calcutta and Aucklandhad had 150 bombs aimed at them without being hit.
NorwegianCommander-in-Chief.Fleet Air Arm.Mosjoen.Namsos area.(v) H.M.S. Wanderer, which had gone ashore on the night of30th April, had been towed off and could still steam25 knots.(vi) At night the remaining troops had been successfullyevacuated from Andalsnes and Molde. The &quot;Primrose&quot;Party had also been successfully brought away fromAlesund, but two seriously wounded, including theBritish Consul at Haugesund, had been left behind.H.M.S. Diana had sailed for Tromso with theNorwegian Commander-in-Chief and thirty of his staff.(vii)It had been found that our aircraft carriers could not operate close enough to the shore to support our troops and they were therefore returning to Scapa to refit, witha view to proceeding to the Narvik area as soon aspossible. The Ark Royal had been heavily bombed but had not been hit, and had shot down one enemy aircraft,(viii) H.M.S. Janus had been prevented by fog from landing herparty at Mosjoen.Discussion then turned on the position in the Namsos area.The Secretary of State for War read a note from General Massyexplaining that the withdrawal had been delayed on account offog. Even if the withdrawal started that night, it could not becompleted until the night of the 3rd/4th May. The main dangeranticipated was concentrated air attack, the risk of which, once the fog lifted, would be greater now that our troops had been with-drawn from Andalsnes. It was therefore of great importance that every effort should be made to provide Fighter protection.It was explained that Namsos was out of range for R.A.F.Fighters operating from this country. It was suggested that thesituation Avould justify considering whether three or four Fightersshould be sent to Namsos under orders to remain there until theirfuel was exhausted.The Chief of the Naval Staff said that an anti-aircraft cruiserwas now off Namsos. The aircraft-carriers Ark Royal and Gloriouswere short of aircraft, but a signal had been sent to the Commander-in-Chief suggesting that they should return at once to Scapa totake on more aircraft. It might be possible&apos; to arrange for these aircraft-carriers to be back off Namsos some time on the following day.The War Cabinet were also informed that a report had beenreceived from General Carton de Wiart to the effect that it wasimpossible for Chasseurs Alpins to proceed along the road fromNamsos to Mosjoen. General Audet considered that to leave a party to fulfil this role would be to lose it. General Carton de Wiarthad been authorised to reach a decision on this point, acting on general Audet&apos;s advice.The Foreign Secretary said that the French Ambassador had called the previous evening to deliver a message from M. Reynaud,asking that the French troops in the Namsos area should not be evacuated. M. Corbin had himself described his visit as a &quot; uselessdemarche.&quot; This request might perhaps be connected with Frenchdomestic politics.In this connection it was thought important that it should bemade clear to General Gamelin that General Audet shared theview that it was impossible to carry out the proposed northwardmovement by land from Namsos to Mosjoen.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he hadalready sent a message to this effect to General Gamelin.The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to send a similarmessage to M. Reynaud, through our Ambassador in Paris.[21246] b 3
The forthcoming Further discussion took place as to the points which shouldDebate in the be made in the Debate in the ensuing week in the House of CommonsHouse of on operations in Norway.The Prime Minister informed his colleagues of a discussion which he had had on the previous day with Sir Archibald Sinclair.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Commons.Italy. 4.   The Secretary of State for foreign Affairs thought thatPossible the situation vis-a-vis Italy was a shade easier than it had been and intentions. that it was unlikely on balance that Italy would make war on us(Previous during, say, the next week or fortnight.  The following information,Reference-        bearing on Italy&apos;s intentions, had come to his notice during theW.M. (40) 109th Previous twenty-four hours-Conclusions, (1) The United  States Ambassador  in  Rome had  visitedMinute 4.) Mussolini on the instructions of President Roosevelt.(Rome telegram No. 441 DIPP, dated 1st May.)Rumour said that Signor Mussolini had assuredMr. Phillips that there would be no change in theexisting situation.(2) The cordial interview between His Majesty&apos;s Minister in rome and Count Ciano.  (Rome telegram No. 444 DIPP;dated 1st May.)(3) Count Ciano&apos;s remark to the French Ambassador in Romethat the Allies need not expect Italy to take any action if things went well for them.   If, however, germany had successes, he &quot;could promise nothing.&quot;    (Paristelegram No. 166.)(4) A lady, on friendly terms with the Italian Ambassador inLondon and his wife, had informed the Foreign office that she had found Signora Bastianirii in tears over theinceasingly bad relations between this country and Italy.The Foreign Secretary thought that the most important factor of all would be the Italian reactions to the results of the Norwegiancampaign. In his judgment, a further warning to Signor Mussolinimight be well timed at the present juncture. He had prepared a brief passage which led up to the following sentence :  &quot; It would be the height of rashness to assume that an act of aggression against any one of the Balkan States would notrapidly lead to a wide extension of the war, with incalculableconsequences to those concerned.&quot;- The Prime Minister said that he had already arranged to mention in his statement that afternoon our fleet dispositions in theMediterranean, and he did not wish to include any additionalwarning in his speech.It was agreed, however, that it might be advantageous if a passage on the lines proposed were to appear in, say, The Times.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Italy.Naval dis-positions in theMediterranean.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 109thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Fleet, whichhe had described on the previous day as being on its way to alexandria, had now passed the danger zone and was level withCrete.Sailings of Italian shipping were being continued normally.The Italians must be aware of the movement of our vessels to alexandria, though they had made no mention of it, and hesuggested that the Prime Minister, in speaking that afternoon,might well include a statement to the effect that we were now able
Suggesteddiversion of australian andNew Zealandtroop convoys.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 107thConclusions,Minute 5.)to revert to our pre-war naval dispositions, and that a considerablefleet was on its way to Alexandria.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to include a passage to this effect in his statement.The Chief of Naval Staff explained that the slow convoycarrying Australian and New Zealand troops was due to arrive atColombo on the following day. If allowed to proceed normally, itwould reach Suez about the 16th May. It was possible to allow the convoy to continue for another five or six days, while still leavingtime to divert it before entering the Red Sea, if the situation wereto deteriorate in the interval.It was generally agreed that this was the right course to adopt.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointed out thatthe fast convoy was now loading in Australia and would, in theordinary way, arrive at Suez about the 31st May. The australian and New Zealand Governments were asking for our views in regardto both these convoys. They had agreed somewhat reluctantly totheir contingents being sent to the United Kingdom, but had askedfor an appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff.The Chief of Naval Staff pointed out that the voyage to thiscountry involved the known dangers of the western approaches,whereas it was still quite uncertain whether any danger would be involved in a voyage through the Red Sea.It was pointed out that the fast convoy, which comprised very big ships, would constitute a specially tempting target.The War Cabinet (i) Agreed that the Australian and New Zealand slow troopconvoy, due at Colombo on the 3rd May, should beallowed to proceed normally, with a view to a decisionbeing taken later on the question whether it should be diverted before entering the Red Sea.(ii) Took note that no immediate decision was called for inregard to the fast convoy.Germany.possible intentions.TheNetherlands.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 109thConclusions,Minute 9.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of the War Cabinet to the following telegrams : Telegram No. 123 DIPP to The Hague, dated the 1st May,instructing His Majesty&apos;s Minister to inquire whether the netherland authorities were aware of the report that aGerman expedition was in readiness to sail at short notice withthe object of seizing the Dutch islands from Texel eastwards(reported in Belgrade telegram No. 178 DIPP, dated the30th April); and, if so, whether they attached any credence toit and were taking any special precautions.Telegram No. 131 DIPP from The Hague, dated the1st May, reporting that the above information had been communicated to the Dutch naval and military authorities.The Dutch naval staff viewed the situation seriously and did not exclude the possibility of a German attack on the islands,particularly in view of increased German naval activity in theEms estuary. Special precautions were being taken accordingly.Whether as a result of this information, or for other reasons,the Dutch authorities were certainly more alarmed than they had
been for some time past.   It was reported that the searchlights ofthe Dutch air defences had been active during the previous night.Air action if the       A record of the subsequent discussion is contained in theNetherlands or   Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Belgium is ^  War Cabinet took note of the above statement.invaded.(previous reference:W.M.

(40) 116), covering a Memorandum by men for the tne Minister of Labour and National Service, and proposing thatArmed Forces, the forthcoming Proclamation for the calling up of men for the,p Armed Forces should cover the next eight age groups, that is, the1 ,    us men born in the years 1911-1904 (both inclusive).liererence: J v &apos;W.M. (39) 119th        The Lord Privy Seal said that the Committee on RecruitmentConclusions,      for the Armed Forces were unanimously of the opinion that the nextMinute 1.)        eight age groups should be covered by the Proclamation.   It wouldalso be necessary to proclaim the 19 age-group in order to ensure the steady call-up of men as they reached the age of 20.The Minister of Labour and National Service expressed hisindebtedness to all the Departments concerned for their very helpfulco-operation.The First Lord of the Admiralty hoped that these proposals would not mean that men would be taken away from important national work and put into the Army only to find that their training, and subsequent incorporation in Field Units, was held upby lack of equipment.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that theprovision of equipment was the limiting factor in the rate at which men were called up.The War Cabinet Approved the proposals of the Lord Privy Seal as set outin his Memorandum (W.P. (G.) (40) 116), &quot;namely : (i) that the forthcoming Proclamation under the NationalService (Armed Forces) Act should cover the nexteight age groups, that is, men born in the years1911-1904 (both inclusive);(ii) that it should also cover the 19 age group for registra-tion purposes only.Norway.Food supplies.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 105thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Chairmanof the Committee on Co-ordination of Departmental Action,covering the Report of a Sub-Committee on the possibility of supplying food to Norway (W.P. (G.) (40) 117).The conclusions of the Sub-Committee were as follows : (a) No food-supplies from this country would be allowed toenter Southern Norway or any part of the country nowunder enemy control.(&amp;) Transport of food-stuffs to the Narvik area and norththereof would jjrima facie be practicable,(c) In so far as facilities for land transport and landing areavailable, food-stuffs of suitable kinds can be supplied from United Kingdom sources.
(d) The simplest method of sending food supplies would beby the despatch to Northern Norway of Norwegian ships,containing suitable cargoes, at present sheltering inBritish ports.The Minister of Food said that there would be no difficulty in providing the necessary food-stuffs since the quantities involved were small.Reference was made to the problem of distribution. The view was expressed that, while our military authorities might be of some assistance in the districts under our control, the problems of distri-bution as whole would have to be handled by the Norwegian localauthorities.The Minister of Shipping said that the arrangements had beenfully discussed between his Department and the Norwegian naval attache. If the Report of the Sub-Committee was approved, action could be taken as soon as authority was received from the admiralty for the ships to sail.The Chancellor of the Exchequer hoped that it would be made clear to the Norwegian Minister that his Government would bedebited with the cost of any food-stuffs supplied to them, pending a settlement of financial relations with Norway.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved the proposals for the supply of food-stuffs to norway as set out in W.P. (G.) (40) 117, as summarised above.(ii) Invited the Minister of Shipping, in consultation with theFirst Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Food,to concert with the Norwegian Naval Attache thenecessary action for the despatch of food-stuffs to norway and their distribution on arrival.(iii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in com-communicating these arrangements officially to theNorwegian Minister, to make it clear that his Govern-ment would be debited with the cost of food-stuffssupplied from United Kingdom sources, pending asettlement of financial relations with Norway.Priorityarrangements.(previous reference erence:R.D.F. 9.   The Minister without Portfolio referred to the decision ofthe War Cabinet referred to in the margin, by which he had beengiven authority to review the system of priorities in respect ofR.D.F.   An immediate decision was now required in the case ofsteel and machine tools.
