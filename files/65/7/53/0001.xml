2 ti 3The air situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 157thConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy activity.E.A.F. activity.1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that a considerable numberof German raids on this country had been recorded from Yorkshireto the Thames. Bombs had been dropped near four aerodromes,but in no instance had serious damage been reported. No reportsof casualties had yet been received.One German aircraft carrying mines had crashed in Suffolk.The R.D.F. Station at Fair Island (between the Orkneys andShetlands) had been machine-gunned by a German aircraft, but no damage had been caused.Many reports had been made to the Police of lights or flaresbeing shown, and it was not easy to sift useful information fromthe mass.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs and Minister for home Security said that the Home Security Organisation was taking steps to filter the mass of reports which were coming in.Continuing, the Chief of the Air Staff said that in the air fighting in France on the previous day we had lost 11 Hurricanesand 4 other Hurricanes had been rendered unserviceable. TheGerman losses were 17 aircraft confirmed, and 5 unconfirmed.The Operations of the Bomber Command had included high-altitude reconnaissances and a number of sorties on enemy concen-trations and communications behind the battle line. In addition,night operations had taken place against the rail-head at Hirsonand oil targets at Hanover and Salzbergen. In this connectiongood explosions were reported by the bomber forces which had attacked the forest of Chimay, where a concentration of tanks was said to be assembled. This target had been indicated by FrenchG.Q.G. In these operations we had lost one Blenheim, and hadshot down one enemy aircraft.The Advanced Air Striking Force had carried out night operations at St. Valery, Abbeville and places east of Amiens, andhad attacked Guise aerodrome.The Prime Minister read out to the War Cabinet the telegramNo. 308 DIPP to Paris, which he had sent to M. Beynaud theprevious night, informing the French of the increased airassistance which we were providing.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the two additional fighter squadrons which we had offered in this telegram to base in france in the Advanced Air Striking Force area had left for Le Mans.On the other hand, it had been necessary to evacuate the Boosaerodrome, near Rouen, owing to the advance of enemy A.F.Vs.to Formerie and Forges.   (See Minute 2.)The Prime Minister suggested that a telegram should be sentto the French informing them of the extent of our air losses inFrance on the previous day.   This was agreed to.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The Western ,Front.Progress of operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 157thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, with one important exception, the situation was generally more favour-able. The French were fighting well and holding the german attacks. They had withdrawn in good order to the line of theAisne, and the line now ran through Noyon-Ailly-Poix to theBresle.The exception was that there had been a break in the line between Poix and Liomer, through which the enemy had pushedtwo armoured divisions in a thrust for Rouen. Enemy armouredunits had been reported at Formerie, Forges and Neufchatel. Thisthrust bore an unpleasant resemblance to the previous break-throughby German armoured divisions.[21393] b 2
Our 51st Division had had a quiet day on the line of theBresle.The line of the Bethune was held only by improvised formationsof Base details from the British troops in the Rouen-Le Havrearea. There was, however, a report that the French had isolated and were dealing systematically with the enemy tanks at Formerie.General Weygand had paid a personal visit to this sector on theprevious day, and regarded the threat to Rouen as serious. As aresult of his visit, the rest of the British Armoured Division hadbeen despatched to assist the improvised British units already referred to.It was explained that the first units of the second Division now on its way to France were now landing at Brest and Cherbourg,but it might be two or three days before the transport and the artillery could be unloaded and moved forward to the area of operations. Cherbourg had been bombed, but little damage had resulted. It was proposed, if the French agreed, to strengthen theA.A. defences by the despatch of mobile equipment from Havre.The General Officer Commanding the British Division on theBresle had been instructed to avoid being trapped in the Le Havrepeninsula. A telegram had been sent to General Weygand asking that this Division should be instructed, if forced to withdraw, towithdraw on the Rouen line; but no reply to this telegram had beenreceived.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 157thConclusions,Minute 3.)German attacks on trade.Operations insupport of.E.F offlie Treport.3. The Chief of Naval Staff said that H.M. Armed merchant cruiser Carinthia had sunk on the evening of the 7th June afterthe remainder of the crew had been taken off. S.S. Eros had beenbeached on Tory Island off N.W. Ireland on the evening of the7th June.   Salvage arrangements were being made.S.S. Frances Massey (4,212 tons), with ore from Newfoundland,had been sunk off N.W. Ireland at midnight the 6th/7th June andS.S. Stancor (798 tons) had been sunk by gunfire from a U-boat off the Faroe Islands on the evening of the 5th June.H.M. destroyer Wanderer had bombarded targets on the enemyflank near Le Treport that morning. A cruiser, with spottingaircraft, was being sent to assist in this bombardment.The movement of shipping, from Havre to Rouen had been stopped and the unloading of ships at Rouen was being expedited;but so far only empty ships were being evacuated from that port.To avoid congestion of shipping, further sailings for Havre hadbeen stopped.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Iceland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 153rdConclusions,Minute 12.)4. The Chief of Naval Staff said that, following the sightingof two unknown ships between Norway and Iceland on the 5th June,rumours had been received of the landing of a strong German force on the East Coast of Iceland in the fjord next to that occupied byone of our detachments. Reconnaissance had been carried out onthe east coast area and reports had been received that there was no sign of enemy activity and that the district was impossible fortroop movement. The Commanding Officer in charge of the opera-tions on the east coast had reported that no German landings hadbeen made.A report had been received early on the 7th June that two large ships had been seen off Reykjavik, steering west. The Chiefof Naval Staff described the naval dispositions taken to deal withan enemy attack on Iceland.   No enemy forces had been sighted.
Italy.S.S. TJmbria.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 155thConclusions,minute.)5. The Prime Minister read a telegram that had been receivedfrom Egypt the previous day, reporting that it was believed thatthe Master and crew of the S.S. Umbria hoped that the ship wouldbe detained as they had no wish to be involved in war when they reached Massawa. In consequence, the Admiralty had been instructed to arrange for the ship to be brought into Port Sudan andto be detained there at least temporarily. It was hoped to make suitable arrangements to secure that the ship did not reachMassawa.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Italy. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a. tele-Contraband gram (No. 844) from Sir Percy Loraine. The latter said that in control. tns conversation with Count Ciano on the 28th May, he had made(Previous it quite clear that Signor Mussolini&apos;s decision to veto continuanceReference: of conversations had automatically restored to us our full libertyW.M. (40) 157th of action in the matter of Contraband Control. Count Ciano had said that this could not be denied.Sir Percy Loraine had suggested that this simple and straight-forward statement would be more convincing ground on which tojustify our action in the event of Italian protests than an argumentbased on the-degree of imminence of Italy&apos;s intention to enter the war.The Chief of Naval Staff said that four Italian ships had nowbeen detained at Gibraltar.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Conclusions;Minute 4.)Egypt.Attitude in theevent of warwith Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 103rdConclusions,Minute- 5.)7. The Prime Minister drew attention to Cairo telegramNo. 447 DIPP recording an.interview between Sir Miles Lampsonand the Egyptian Prime Minister. Sir Miles Lampson thoughtthat there was now considerable doubt as to Egypt&apos;s attitude in theevent of war between Great Britain and Italy. A theory ofabstention and even of the possibility of neutrality was spreadingin Cairo. Sir Miles&apos; had judged it necessary to speak to theEgyptian Prime Minister with brutal straightness.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he also had&apos;spoken:very frankly to the Egyptian Ambassador in London,who realised that Egypt could not possibly remain neutral in theevent of Italy entering the war. The Foreign Secretary doubted whether the Egyptian situation was seriously deteriorating. the egyptians had taken such necessary precautionary steps as theremoval of Italians from key posts in industry, &amp;c. Whatdeterioration there was must be largely attributed to the mischievousactivities of the Egyptian Minister in Rome.In discussion it was agreed that any theory of Egyptianneutrality in the event of Anglo-Italian hostilities was completelyuntenable and must break down the moment we began militaryoperations based on Egypt. Sir Miles Lampson certainly appearedalarmed at the position.   It would be as well to telegraph to him,The Chief of the Air Staff said that a reconnaissance had beencarried out off the east coast of Iceland, but had seen nothing.In reply to a question, the Secretary of State for DominionA fairs said that Canada was making active preparations to send a force to Iceland. He undertook to impress on the Canadians theneed for despatching this force as soon as possible.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
saying that His Majesty&apos;s Government fully approved the firmlanguage which he had used, and that if the situation should&quot; A &quot; I demand it, he was authorised to speak in even starker terms, andto make it clear that in times like the present we should allownothing to stand in the way of our military security.The War Cabinet took note of these statements and invited the Foreign Secretary to send a telegram to Sir miles lampson on the lines suggested at &quot;A.&quot;Germany. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionReported new to two telegrams containing reports of alleged new German weapons,weapons. viz. :  Washington Telegram No. 172; Purco, Lima TelegramNo. 55.Discussion ensued as to various new devices on which theefforts of our scientists were now being concentrated.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Home Defence. 9.   The Foreign Secretary mentioned a letter he had receivedProtection of about the vulnerability of British coal mines, suggesting that the collieries pitheads should be protected day and night by armed militaryguards.The Secretary of State for War undertook to give furtherconsideration to this matter, but pointed out that the mounting ofmilitary guards at a large number of  dispersed points wasincompatible with the maintenance of adequate mobile reserves.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.british expeditionary force.reorganisation of divisionsconsequent onthe withdrawal from Flanders.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 153rdConclusions,Minute 10.)10. The Secretary of State for War outlined the scheme whichhad been prepared to deal with the 12 Divisions evacuated from france.The Prime Minister said that his first reactions to the scheme were very favourable; but he thought that the War Cabinet shouldhave an opportunity to study the scheme on paper, before givingfinal approval to it.He suggested that the Secretary of State to circulate amemorandum for consideration on Monday, the 10th June.It would be helpful if this memorandum could show how itwas proposed to fit into the military machine at home: the 16 British battalions which were being sent home from india;the Australian troops now on their way to this country;the 2nd Canadian Division.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War to circulate amemorandum for consideration on Monday, the 10th June.German oil supplies.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 157thConclusions,Minute 10.)11. The War Cabinet discussed the question of German oil supplies in the light of the conclusions reached at their meeting onthe previous day.A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 8, 1940.
