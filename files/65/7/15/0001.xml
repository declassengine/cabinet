1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave the WarCabinet the latest details of the situation on the Western Front,which can be summarised as follows :  Front Givet-Namur and Ardennes. French light forceswithdrawn behind the Meuse from Givet to Namur, all bridgesbeing blown. The bridge at Huy also destroyed. Germanmechanised forces moving Southward from Neufchateau andArlon.Front Namur- Wavre. The French in position, with light forces in advance of the line.  Not in touch with the Germans.Front Wavre-Louvain. B.E.F. in position. Front some-what restricted owing to presence of Belgians holding Louvain.Belgians holding from Louvain to Antwerp.Front North of Antwerp. French light forces fallingback in front of German mechanised columns advancing fromBreda and Tilburg. The French intend to hold a position fromAntwerp to Bergen op Zoom.The general situation on the whole front showed strong Germanmechanised forces advancing in a number of directions, but as yet no signs of infantry columns. The French were not yet certain whether the main German effort was directed through Luxemburgagainst the left of the Maginot Line, or through Maastricht. Thefirst phase of the movement of the French and British armies wouldbe complete by 7 o&apos;clock the following morning, and they would been gaged in consolidating their positions. The Belgian army didnot appear to be putting up a strong resistance, and Liege was probably isolated.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the only occurrence ofparticular interest during the day had been an attack by bombersfrom the Advanced Air Striking Force against a Germanmechanised column which was advancing South from Breda, andwhich the French had asked us urgently to attack. The bombers had carried out their task, and blocked the road with the debris of a factory.The fighters of the Advanced Air Striking Force and the air component were engaged in continuous action against waves of enemy bombers, and they reported that they had shot down in combat since the beginning of the operations 108 aircraft confirmed,and 50 unconfirmed.The First Sea Lord said that destroyers had answered a numberof calls for assistance off the Dutch coast. One which had gonein to try and bombard the causewray across the mouth of the ZuyderZee, and which had taken on a Dutch pilot at The Helder, had notbeen able to get within 12 miles of the causeway.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that reports from holland showed that the situation in Fortress Holland was veryprecarious, and that the Germans were landing more and moretroops in the Rotterdam area. The battalion of Guards which had landed at The Hook of Holland was moving forward to see whetherit could assist in clearing up parachute troops.The Secretary of State for War said that General Gamelinhad now wired to say that, in view of the situation in Holland,he did not think any good purpose would be served by moving theLight Division now at Brest to assist the Dutch. He (the Secretaryof State) would like to be given discretion to withdraw the British battalion from The Hook if, after consultation with the Admiralty,it appeared desirable to do so.The Prime Minister hoped that the battalion would not be withdrawn, if it were successfully providing a nucleus to rallyDutch resistance. He agreed, however, that the matter should be-left to the discretion of the Secretary of State for War.[21284] . b 2The western front.Progress of operations.Situation in holland.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a recentmessage received from The Hague indicated that the Legation&apos;staff would be leaving that evening. The British Military Mission,however, proposed to remain. This, it was hoped, was an indication that the Dutch resistance might continue for some little time.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that orders had been sentto the destroyers and demolition parties at Rotterdam that, unless they received contrary orders before 8 p.m., they should proceedwith the destruction of the oil supplies at Rotterdam. The royal engineers party at Amsterdam, where the situation was easier,had everything prepared for demolition, and would act as thesituation demanded. The Dutch objections to the destruction of the oil at Rotterdam had not yet been removed. It had been suggestedthat the burning of this vast quantity of oil would create such apall of smoke over the area as seriously to hinder air and seanavigation.The Chief of the Air Staff said that he did not think thatthis would be detrimental to the operations of the Royal Air Force.There was general agreement that the present opportunity of destroying the oil should not be lost, though it would be advisable for the Officers on the spot, if they could safely do so, to informthe local Dutch authorities of their intentions.The Prime Minister said that the picture which had beenplaced before the War Cabinet of the present situation showed thatthere were two alternatives. The Germans might either be launchingtheir great land attack with the object of trying to defeat the franco-British armies, or they might content themselves withmaking contact along the line which the Allied armies had taken up in Belgium, and with consolidating their position in Hollandpreparatory to their great attack on this country.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff agreed with this viewof the situation, but thought that the extent to which the germans had committed their air and mechanised resources indicated thatthe land battle was beginning. Once the penetrations made by theGerman mechanised forces had been widened, the advance of their main columns might be expected to begin.The War Cabinet (i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Authorised the Secretary of  State  for War,  at his discretion, to withdraw the battalion which had been landed at The Hook of Holland.(iii) Approved the orders which had been issued  to the demolition parties for the destruction of the Dutch oil supplies at Rotterdam.Air Policy.Action to betaken by thelong-range bombers.(previous reference:W.M. (40), Oon-2. The War Cabinet had under consideration the action tobe taken in existing circumstances by the long-range bombers.A record of the discussion, and of the conclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.
Invasion ofGreat Britain.Action to betaken againstGermanparachutists.(previous reference erences:W.M. (40) 119thConclusions,Minute 4,and Con- .elusions 119 B,Minute 3.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that further considera-tion had been given to the methods to be employed for dealing withparachute attacks.  The following were proposed : (1) That additional rifles and small arm ammunition shouldbe issued to A.A. units.(2) That a corps of local defence volunteers should be formed.This Corps would be placed under the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces.(3) The third measure for which authority was asked, wasthat if parachutists were landed in this country, theCommander-in-Chief, Home Forces, should be authorisedto instruct the B.B.C. to broadcast instructions to troops.This involved some departure from the previous decision that the B.B.C. should not broadcast at times when air attack was being made against this country.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathis Department, which was collaborating with the War Office in thismatter, was in agreement with the Secretary of State for War&apos;sproposals. In particular, he was anxious that he should be consulted in regard to the proposed broadcast to be made by theSecretary of State on the 14th May calling for volunteers to handin their names at their local Police Stations. He was also anxious that this appeal should not result in numbers of part-time civil defence personnel abandoning their existing tasks for what mightbe regarded as a more spectacular job.The Chief of the Air Staff said that he understood it was proposed that youths of 18 and 19 should be recruited to act as additional guards on aerodromes. He felt some doubt whether theseyouths were the right type to deal with parachute troops.The War Cabinet Approved the Secretary of State for War&apos;s proposals,subject to further consideration being given to the points raised in discussion.Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 118thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 509 DIPP from Italy.There had been a fresh outburst of Italian animosity, evenmore bitter than the last. It seemed that Signor Mussolini waseither trying to give the utmost assistance to Germany without going to war, or was trying to make Italy war-minded beforedriving her into war.Sir P. Loraine thought that Hitler&apos;s manoeuvre was to provoke the Allies into declaring war on Italy, and that theright course for us was to wait for Signor Mussolini to attackor declare war on us.If the Germans developed their grand attack on theWestern Front and things went well for them, signor mussolini&apos;s decision might be taken in the present week.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States ambassador in Rome had told his colleague in London that he did not think that signor Mussolini was going to war.The Foreign Secretary, subject to all reservations, was still ofthe same opinion, but with less confidence than before.The Chief of the Naval Staff gave various information bearing on Italy&apos;s probable attitude. There were a number of facts whichpointed towards warlike preparations. It would be interesting tosee whether the Conte di Savoia had sailed that day from Genoafor the United States.

At the endprotection of of that period, however, a number of tankers would reach Suez andBritish . it would, be necessary to decide whether they should be allowedshipping. through the Mediterranean.   The only immediate step which he(Previous wished to take was to order tankers south-bound to Gibraltar to reference:        proceed to Curacao to load, instead of going through the Medi-W.M.

If it proved impossible to send ore shipsMinute 3.)        into the Mediterranean, we should have to buy steel from the UnitedStates.   The French, however, did not contemplate a position inwhich we should not be able to send ships into the western mediterranean.The War Cabinet :-(1) Took note of the above statements, and invited the foreign secretary to ascertain the views of the French Govern-ment as to the probable intentions of the ItalianGovernment.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Shipping should order tankersat present proceeding south-bound to Gibraltar toproceed to Curacao to load, instead of passing throughthe Mediterranean to Abadan.5. In connection with the preceding Minute, the Lord privy seal referred to the position in Spain. An informant, whose fore-casts had on a previous occasion been justified to the hilt, hadprophesied that Spain would attack the Allies within 48 hours andthis would be the signal for Italy to come into the war.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said there were rumours thatthere was a group of falangists who, with the aid of the largenumber of Germans in Spain, would attempt to come into the war against the Allies and thus involve Italy in the war.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theSpanish Ambassador, whom he had seen the day before, had beenemphatic that General Franco was determined not to get involvedin the war. The Spanish Ambassador had minimised the risk ofinternal disturbances in Spain.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Spain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 108thConclusions,Minute 7.)United States ofAmerica.Proposedpersonalmessage fromthe PrimeMinister toPresidentRoosevelt.6. The Prime Minister said that, if his colleagues approved,,he proposed to send a personal message to President Roosevelt,informing him of the seriousness of the situation.This suggestion met with approval.Discussion ensued as to what action President Roosevelt could take to help the Allies.
Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,May 13, 1940.Supply of Reference was made to a suggestion which had been putaircraft. forward at a Meeting of Ministers held at the Admiralty on(Previous Saturday, the 11th May, that we should ask the United States to reference:        let us have aircraft at once from their own supplies.   Later, theseW.M. (40), Con- supplies would be replaced from the orders which we had alreadyelusions 119 B,   placed in the United States.   This suggestion had already been minute 4.)        taken up with the Anglo-French Purchasing Commission in theUnited States.   Mr. Kennedy, however, had said that&apos;, if anythingeffective was to be done, it was essential that the matter should betaken out of the ordinary official channels.In this connection, the United States Ambassador had also saidthat he understood that there were some aircraft in the UnitedStates which had been ordered by the Swedish Government and notyet shipped. This, again, was a matter which might be raised direct with President Roosevelt.There was also the possibility that the Admiralty and the WarOffice might be especially anxious to obtain certain war material from the United States.The War Cabinet-Invited the three Service Ministers and the Minister ofSupply to communicate at once to the Prime Ministerany suggestion they might wish to put forward for inclusion in the Prime Minister&apos;s proposed personal message to President Roosevelt as to particular types ofwar material which they were especially anxious to obtain from the United States.In their communication the Air Ministry should deal withthe question of aircraft ordered by Sweden and not yetshipped from the United States.
