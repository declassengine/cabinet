(40) 145) making certain recommendations on the assumption that Germany had decided to seek a decision in 1940.The War Cabinet considered seriatim the recommendations setout in paragraph 3 of the Report.(a) That every possible step should be taken to hasten the productionof anti-aircraft equipment, particularly Bofors guns, bomber and fighter aircraft and fully trained crews, even at thetemporary expense of our long-term programme.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Bofors gun situation was very serious, and the Chiefs of Staff had put up a special report on the subject to the Military Co-ordination Committee(M.C. (40) 95).In discussion, it was explained that the Military Co-co-ordination committee had recently examined the situation with the Ministerof Supply. The factory at Nottingham was working at full capacity. At Coventry, however, owing to labour difficulties, afull night-shift was not employed, and it was suggested that furtherendeavours should be made to improve the labour situation atCoventry. Another difficulty was the weakness of the NuffieldOrganisation.The Prime Minister referred to the statement that some of theBofors guns sent to Norway had lacked predictors. The Secretaryof State for War explained that this was not so, but that, owingto difficulties in unloading, certain guns might have been unloadedwithout their predictors.Reference was also made to reports from officers returning from norway that the predictor made the working of the Bofors guntoo slow. The Secretary of State for War said that this point would be dealt with in reports of operations in Norway.In regard to the part of this recommendation which dealt with fighter aircraft, the Secretary of State for Air said that he hadbeen examining what steps could be taken to improve output duringthe next few months without interfering with our long-term programme. He would submit a Report to the War Cabinet onthis matter in the near future.(b) That every endeavour should be made to induce the dutch government to give the assurance for which -they have beenasked that they will make immediate preparations for the demolition of their aerodromes in the event of invasion.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Dutch Governmentwere believed to have taken certain steps in preparation for the demolition of their aerodromes in the event of invasion. He wastrying to get further information through the Air Attache.(c) That the plan,s already prepared for dealing with invasion ofthis country should be reviewed forthwith and requirementsmet. In this respect the Ministry- of Home Security shouldbe instructed to maintain the closest touch with the service departments.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff Com-mittee were engaged in a full examination of this problem, and.[21271] b 2
had discussed the matter with the Commander-in-Chief, home forces. They would be reporting shortly to the Military Co-ordina-tion Committee.The Minister of Home Security said that the regional organisation was in very close touch with the Service authorities,but the new appreciation which extended the area for raids to theNorth of Scotland, and envisaged the possibility of invasionanywhere between the Wash and Newhaven, would involve theworking out of plans on a broader basis than before.The Secretary of State for War questioned whether any partof the South coast of England could be regarded as a likely area for invasion. If areas in which attack was unlikely were includedin the scheme, one result would be to detract from the strength ofthe forces available to protect more vulnerable areas.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that theproposal made in debate by Lord Mottistone that local levies armed with rifles might be found from among the older men to guardisolated places of importance, was worth consideration.The Chief of the Air Staff said that all these matters would be fully studied by the Chiefs of Staff. -The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the first essentialof a successful defence against invasion was the holding of compactmobile forces composed of good troops, armed with complete and up-to-date equipment, ready to strike any force landing in thecountry.The Secretary of State for War said that Armoured Divisionsrepresented the best type of troops for this purpose. When the1st Armoured Division went to France which it would shortly be doing it was proposed to bring back the rest of the 5th Division,so that there would be a complete Regular formation in this country.Passive defence (d) That active steps should be taken to editcate public opinion tothe reality of the air threat and to develop to the highestpitch of efficiency our passive defence measures.The Minister of Home Security strongly supported this recom-mendation. He was anxious about the apathetic attitude displayedby the general public towards civil defence, in spite of efforts to stimulate them. Many people seemed to think that air attack wouldnot take place, or, if it did, would be easily dealt with. This ideahad been to some extent fostered by the cutting down of permanentA.R.P. personnel. If the general public, from whom civil defence volunteers were drawn, were apathetic, it was difficult to arouseenthusiasm in the volunteers. He thought that much could be donein the course of speeches by Ministers, and in talks to the Press,to draw attention to the danger of air attack.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that he would deprecatea regular campaign at this stage as to the danger of air attack.He thought the right policy was to perfect the organisation to dealwith air attack, and to rely on the falling of the first bombs tobring people to their senses.The Prime Minister agreed. If a fresh campaign to arousepublic opinion on this point were now undertaken, and if no bombingtook place in the course of the next month or so, the campaign wouldnot only lose its effect, but would cause a renewed onset of publicapathy. It would be right, however, that an occasional warning should be made by Ministers in their speeches.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that a circular tolocal authorities drawing attention to recent events in Norwaymight serve the purpose of warning the country of the type of danger to be expected.measures.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 121stConclusions,Minute 2.)
Diversion ofshipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 93rdConclusions.,Minute 15.)Reduction ofnon-essential imports.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 56thConclusions,Minute 2.)financial considerations.The Prime Minister thought this suggestion worth followingup. He undertook to draw the attention of the Minister of Informa-tion to the need for counteracting apathy without causing alarm.(e) That arrangements for the diversion of shipping to West coast ports should be placed in a state of immediate readiness, Thisshould be combined with urgent measures drastically to restrict non-essential imports.The Minister without Portfolio said that in the course of theprevious few days he had overhauled the arrangements for the diversion of shipping to West coast ports. All the recommendationsof Lord Chatfield&apos;s Report had been carried out. Steps had beentaken to ensure that there was no congestion at the West coast ports.In fact, at the present moment, there were less goods in the Westcoast ports than at any time for years past.The First Lord of the Admiralty enquired whether there was an executive officer, who, if the emergency arose, could over-rideGovernment Departments, and ensure the successful execution of diversion plans.The Minister without Portfolio said that the whole arrange-ments were centred in the Ministry of Transport, where the port and Transit Committee dealt daily with all movements of shipping in a most efficient manner. He reminded the War Cabinet thathe had been invited to act as the referee to whom departmental ministers could come for help in any case of difficulty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had recentlyexamined the question of cutting down non-essential imports. a drastic reduction had already been made, and he was satisfied that non-essential goods would not be imported.(f) In vietv of the seriousness of the situation we submit that, inputting these recommendations into effect&apos;, financial con-siderations should not be allowed to stand in the way.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff Com-mittee had put forward this recommendation with diffidence, as theyappreciated the great financial difficulties; but they hoped that, ifthere were any financial restrictions which were holding upproduction, or the execution of contracts, they would speedily beremoved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he in no way objected to this recommendation. He had examined the Report to see whether any of the measures recommended were being held up for financial reasons, and he was glad to find that they were not. Thedifficulties of production rather than of payment were the governing-factors.The War Cabinet (1) Took note of the Review by the Chiefs of Staff of the strategical situation on the assumption that germany has decided to seek a decision in 1940 (W.P. (40) 145),and gave general approval to the recommendations con-tained in paragraph 3.(2) Took note of the points made in discussion in regard tothese recommendations, and agreed that the following action should be taken : (a) Production of anti-aircraft equipment, particularlyBofors guns.That the Military Co-ordination Committeeshould keep a close watch on the production of anti-[21271] b 3
aircraft equipment, especially Bofors guns. Thepossibility of increasing the production of theNuffield Factory at Coventry, by working a fullnight-shift, should be examined.(b) Passive defence measures:That, while it would be undesirable to institutean intensive campaign, steps should be taken to remind public opinion of the reality of the airthreat, and of the need for bringing our passivedefence measures to a high state of efficiency. Inthis connection (i) The Prime Minister undertook to consult withthe Minister of Information as to the steps which should be taken to counteract publicapathy :(ii) The Minister of Home Security undertook toconsider the issue of a Circular Letter toLocal Authorities, drawing attention, in thelight of the campaign in Norway, to the dangers which must be guarded against:(iii) Ministers would no doubt take the opportunityof drawing attention to this matter from timeto time in their speeches.NetherlandWest Indies.Protection of oil refineries inAruba andCuracao in theevent of aGermaninvasion of holland.2. The &quot;War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff Committee (W.P. (40) 148).The First Sea Lord said that it was of vital. importance toprevent interference with the oil refineries in Aruba and Curacao.The greatest danger was that of sabotage. There were sevenGerman ships now in Curacao and one at Aruba, and many Germanresidents in the Islands. A scheme for the despatch of troops to the islands had been agreed with the French, and the Commander-in-Chief, America and West Indies Stations, had been instructed tomake all arrangements for the transport of three companies ofBritish troops from Jamaica to Curacao, and a detachment ofFrench troops from Martinique to Aruba. The Chiefs of Staffproposed that the Admiralty should be responsible for giving theexecutive order for these moves immediately a German invasion of Holland began.In answer to a question by the Prime Minister, he said thatthe Dutch, who seemed to realise the danger of sabotage and also thepossibility of the Venezuelans trying to occupy the Islands them-selves, had already increased their precautions.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs deprecated theproposal in paragraph 4 of the Report to warn the Dutch Govern-ment now to be on their guard. The Dutch showed clearly thatthey did not wish to be involved with us in any way in taking-precautions against enemy action. Moreover, such a move would run counter to our present policy, which we had followed in the caseof Iceland, of having no preliminary consultations before landingforces in the outlying possessions of countries overrun by Germany.All the necessary arrangements had been made by the Foreign office for inviting the United States Government to share in the controlof the Islands, though we should be careful not to use the word&quot;occupation&quot; when the approach was made. We should makeit clear that the despatch of troops was a purely temporary measureso long as the danger lasted. The texts of the communications tobe made to the United States Government had been agreed with lord Lothian in Washington, who was in favour of the proposalsof the Chiefs of Staff to send troops to the Islands and to invite
the United States to share in their control. Drafts of these com-munications had been given to the French; they were suggestingsome amendments which had not yet been received.The Minister without Portfolio suggested that, if a formalapproach to the Dutch Government was not to be made, the british consul should be instructed to make an informal approach to theDutch authorities in the Islands as to the danger of sabotage.The Secretary of State for War said that he had spoken toMr. Rogers, the Canadian Minister of Defence, on the matter, andhad suggested that it would be of great assistance to us if the troopswithdrawn from Jamaica could be replaced by Canadians.Mr. Rogers had undertaken to mention the matter to Mr. mackenzie king, without stating the destination of the troops to be withdrawnfrom Jamaica. He was hopeful that the Canadian Governmentwould supply the necessary troops.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought that itwould be better to take Mr. Mackenzie King completely into our confidence.The War Cabinet (i) Approved the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staffcontained in paragraph 12 of W.P. (40) 148, subjectto the proviso that no official approach should be madeto the Dutch Government in regard to precautions against sabotage in Aruba and Curacao.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toconsider the desirability of instructing the british consul in the Islands to make an informal approach tothe local Dutch authorities on the subject of anti-sabotage precautions.Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tocommunicate with Mr. Mackenzie King :(a) informing him of the action proposed; and(b) asking him to agree that, if British troops were withdrawn from Jamaica, they might be replaced by Canadian troops.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 115thConclusions,Minute 2.)(in)3. The Secretary of State for Air said that the only enemy activity reported in the neighbourhood of our coast had been the approach of two aircraft to the south coast early on the morning of the 9th May.No operations had been carried out by the Bomber Commandon the previous night on account of the bad weather.The Coastal Command had carried out reconnaissances of the heligoland Bight and of the Norwegian Coast. At Stavanger only12 aircraft had been seen on the aerodrome and two aircraft mooredin the adjacent anchorage.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Naval 4.   The First Lord of the A dmiralty described certain naval situation. movements which were being made to meet the contingency of a(Previous German invasion of Holland.Reference:W.M. (40) 115thConclusions,Minute 3.)Submarine H.M. submarine Taku had reported that she had attacked two operations.        transports escorted by two destroyers 100 miles north-north-west
of Horns Reef on the afternoon of the 8th May and believed thatshe had made three hits. She had subsequently been attacked bydepth charges and had retired to westward to repair her damage.An enemy submarine was suspected in the Dogger Bank area and a suspicious surface craft, which might have been mine-laying,had been reported off Newcastle. The Tyne was&apos;now closed pendingsearch, but, generally speaking, traffic was proceeding almostnormally in spite of the recent enemy mine-laying activities.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 115thConclusions,Minute 4.)Kirkenes area.Narvik area.5.   The War Cabinet were given the following information (1) The cruiser Devonshire had sailed from Scapa for Kirkenesto forestall any landing of Germans there.Bodo andMosjoen.(2) Lord Cork had reported certain operations which he wasplanning in order to improve the position of his troops.He had explained that he was committed to these operations, but that he would prepare at the same timefor a more direct attack.(3) The arrival of H.M.S. Ark Royal had had a marked effecton the air situation for 24 hours, but bombing had begunagain, all anchorages having been attacked on the8th May, as well as ships off Narvik.(4) Lord Cork had visited Skaanland aerodi-ome and reportedthat at least 9 days would be required before it couldbe used. He stressed the importance of securing the arrival of Hurricane aircraft at the earliest possible date, as these were the only aircraft capable of dealingwith Heinkels.The Chief of the Air Staff pointed out that, whileit was no doubt important to expedite the arrival of theHurricanes, Gladiators were in fact of considerable use against Heinkels. Skuas had also had some successagainst Heinkels in the Trondhjem area.(5) In answer to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff said thatthere were rumours from Sweden that the Germans had established new aerodromes in Norway, but that this information had not been confirmed.(6) The destroyer I sis had hit submerged wreckage in BallengerFjord close to Narvik and was being towed to SkjelFjord after landing her troops. Penelope, which hadbeen effecting repairs at Skjel Fjord, had been due toleave on the night of the 8th-9th May. Aurora had reported some casualties and one turret out of action;the cause of the damage was not yet known, but waspresumed to have been a bomb. A convoy with fuel and stores was due to arrive on the evening of the 9th May.Arrangements had been made to man a British destroyerwith the crew of the Polish destroyer Grom, which hadbeen sunk a few days previously. Lord Cork had described the crew as &quot; excellent material.&quot;(7) Fog had prevented the proposed landing of troops at Bodo,but troops had been disembarked at Mosjoen and theFrench troops embarked from there. The Frenchreported 2 German battalions 25 miles to the South.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatthis information need not necessarily be accepted as.
altogether accurate. The force which had been landedunder Lieut.-Colonel Gubbins was specially equipped for guerrilla tactics, and might be expected effectively to harass the enemy.Casualties in (8) The Secretary of State for War said that definite informa-the Trondhjem tion was not yet available as to casualties incurred byarea. our   troops  in   the   fighting   North   and   South  ofTrondhjem, but it was thought that they would probablyamount to 1,700 or 1,800 in all. Brigadier Phillips&apos;sBrigade, which had been described by American press correspondents as having been seriously cut up, had, infact, suffered some 200 casualties in all.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Italy.Navaldispositionsin theMediterranean.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 115thConclusions,Minute 3.)Diversion of australian andNew Zealandtroop convoy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 111thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The First Lord of the A dmiralty informed the War Cabinetthat H.M.S. Warspite had now passed through the danger zone andwould shortly join the rest of the Fleet at Alexandria.The First Sea Lord said that the slow convoy with australian and New Zealand troops was now approaching Aden and that itwould soon be too late to divert it from going through the Red Sea.The convoy consisted of five ships and would be escorted by H.M.S.Ramillies, one cruiser and two destroyers. This escort could beregarded as adequate against any possible sea attack but could not,of course, provide complete protection against air action in the dangerous stretch of 500 miles immediately after passing Aden.In answer to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff explainedthat some protection could be provided by fighter aircraft fromAden and again when the convoy would be approaching Suez, butnot in between.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadno information which would suggest that the position was becoming more serious and that the convoy ought to be diverted.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theAustralian Government were ready to accept our proposals in regardto the convoy, but that they assumed that sufficient protection wouldbe provided against sea and air attack.It was generally agreed that while it was impossible to give an assurance that the convoy was provided with &quot; sufficient pro-tection&quot; against all possible air attack, it was neverthelessreasonable in the circumstances that the convoy should be allowedto proceed. In the ordinary way it would reach Suez about the15th May.The War Cabinet agreed That the slow convoy with Australian and New Zealandtroops then approaching Aden should proceed on its voyageto Suez, as originally planned.
