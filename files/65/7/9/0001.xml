TheNetherlands andBelgium.Invasion byGermany.(PreviousKeference:W.M. (40) 116thConclusions,Minute 7.)Employment ofthe Britishheavy bomber force.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 115thConclusions,Minute 6.)The War Cabinet was given the information which had beenreceived since the first news at 5-30 a.m. that the Germans hadinvaded Holland. Parachute troops had been dropped betweenLeyden and The Hague, and in the Rotterdam area. TheLuxemburg frontier had been crossed by German troops. TheGermans were said to have dropped bombs on Nancy, and twoof our aerodromes in northern France had been bombed, but missed.One bomb was said to have fallen in Brussels.H.M.S. Birmingham and 8 destroyers had had a brush with german mine-laying and motor torpedo boats off the Belgian coast.H.M.S. Kelly had been hit by a torpedo, but was being towed home.Magnetic mines had been dropped in the Scheldt, and the admiralty was sending sweeping gear to clear channels in order that dutch and Belgian shipping might get out. H.M. submarines had been ordered to sink all German ships off the Dutch and Belgian coastswithout warning. A message received from Headquarters, B.A.F.F.,stated that 5 German aircraft had been shot down. The Head-quarters had been bombed, but with no serious results.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had rung upM. Corbin at 6 a.m. and asked him to find out from the FrenchGovernment if the armies would move into Belgium on the informa-tion which had been received up to that hour, namely, that the attack was on Holland alone. He had replied at 6-20 that Belgiumhad already been invaded, and had asked for help. The wholeplan for the advance of the Allied forces into the Low countries had been set in motion. The troops were not at the highest stateof readiness, but would certainly be on the move quickly. TheRoyal Marine Operation was at 24 hours&apos; notice and would be set in motion.The Dutch Government had appealed for Allied assistance.The discussion then turned on the action to be taken by ourheavy bomber force.The Chief of the Air Staff said that there were, broadly speaking, two main courses open to us : (i) To start bombing operations on targets in the Ruhr withour heavy bombers.(ii) To hold them all back to intervene in a critical situationin the land battle.From the point of view of the possible German retaliationhe did not think there was any difference between bombing the marshalling yards in the Ruhr or bombing the coke ovens and oil refineries. His own view was that it would be unsound to put thewhole of our heavy bomber forces on to targets west of the Rhinesuch as Munchen-Gladbach. He thought we should put somesquadrons on to these targets, but keep the remainder in hand forattacks on the Ruhr. A decision would, however, be required later in the day as to whether we were to carry out attacks on the Ruhr.He emphasised that it would be possible up till the last moment to stop squadrons attacking any particular objective, but not to switchthem from one objective to another.The Secretary of State for Air read a message from the air officer Commanding-in-Chief, British Air Forces in France,reporting a conversation with the American Ambassador in Paristhe previous day. Mr. Bullitt had said that he hoped the allies would act with vigour if the Germans invaded the Low Countries.American public opinion would accept a very broad interpretation of &quot; military &quot; targets for air attack.The War Cabinet agreed that it would be preferable not to begin bombing operations in the Ruhr until we had definite newsthat the Germans had attacked targets in the Low Countries or[21276] B 2
Despatch ofHurricanefightersquadrons toFrance.Home forces.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 116thConclusions,Minute 1.)Denial of dutch and Belgianresources toGermany.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 114thConclusions,Minute 1.)Protection of oil refineries atAruba andCuracao.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 116thConclusions,Minute 2.)Air RaidPrecautions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 116thConclusions,Minute 1.)France, which would cause casualties to civilians, but that the AirForce should be authorised to bomb targets west of the Rhine suchas Munchen-Gladbach that night in any case, in order to impede the advance of the German armies.The Chief of the Air Staff said that bombing operations by the advanced Air Striking Force would be under the direction of theFrench High Command, since they would be in direct support ofthe land operations. According to a message received from theAir Officer Commanding-in-Chief, British Air Forces in France,General Vuillemin had not yet ordered any bombing by the French air forces. It was agreed that it would be desirable to clear upthe French attitude.Continuing, the Chief of the Air Staff referred to the plan which had been agreed with the French for the despatch of fourHurricane fighter squadrons to France, if the situation in thiscountry permitted it. Two of these squadrons had already been ordered to move. Another of the four squadrons earmarked hadbeen packed up and embarked en route for Narvik. The fourthsquadron had also been packed up for Narvik, but had. not yetbeen embarked. He asked to be given discretion to divert this lastsquadron to France if the situation in France demanded it and thesituation here permitted it. There would be no interference withthe Gladiator squadron now en route to Narvik, which would thusget two squadrons of fighters.It was agreed that this matter should be left to the discretion of the Chief of the Air Staff.The Secretary of State for War said that the coast defences and home forces were being put at immediate readiness. Thiswould involve considerable expenditure in the case of the home forces, but he assumed that no objection would be raised to this.This was agreed to.The Minister without Portfolio said that the plan for theprevention of Dutch and Belgian resources falling into the handsof the Germans, had automatically been set in motion. HisMajesty&apos;s Ministers at Brussels and The Hague would already have approached the Belgian and Dutch Governments offering themour co-operation.The First Sea Lord said that the 4 destroyers taking ourdemolition parties across would sail at 10 a.m.Instructions had now been given to take the precautions againstsabotage in Aruba and Curacao which the War Cabinet had approved the previous day.The First Sea Lord undertook to keep the Foreign Officeinformed of developments, and, in particular, to let the ForeignOffice know as soon as troops left for Aruba and Curacao, in orderthat the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs might make any necessary communications to the Dutch and United States Govern -ments.In a short discussion the view was very generally expressed that steps should be taken, having regard to the increasedprobability of air attack against the United Kingdom, to bring theAir Raid Precautions organisation into a state of instant readiness.The War Cabinet-(i) Authorised the Air Staff to carry out air attacks on military targets west of the Rhine that night with a portion of the heavy bomber force,(ii) Agreed that other squadrons of the heavy bomber force should be made ready to attack marshalling yards, oil
refineries and coke ovens in the Ruhr that night, butthat these operations should not begin without a furtherdecision by the War Cabinet, to be taken in the lightof information received during the day as to the actionof the German Air Force in France and the low countries.(iii) Gave the Chief of the Air Staff discretion to divert toFrance one Hurricane squadron which had been packedup for despatch to Narvik, if in his view the situationso demanded in France and conditions in this countrypermitted.(iv) Authorised Plan XD, for the denial of Dutch and Belgianresources to the Germans, and Plan Lyster (preparatorymeasures for the blocking of the Belgian ports) to beput into full effect forthwith.(v) Invited the Minister for Home Security to issue any instructions necessary to ensure that the Civil defence organisation was immediately placed at the highest stateof readiness.(vi) Invited the Minister for Home Security to issue, in con-sultation with the Minister of Information, anycommuniques or public warnings that might be required.In particular, the public might be warned to look to thestate of their gas masks.(vii) Took note that the War Office were placing the coast defences and home forces at the highest state of readiness.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 10, 1940.
