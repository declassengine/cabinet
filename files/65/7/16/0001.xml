The western front.Progress of operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 120thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a Summary of the maindevelopments in the naval, military and air situation which hadtaken place during the past twenty-four hours. The following information was given to them in amplification of this Summary : In the north the situation was somewhat clearer; the french had withdrawn and were holding the line from the Antwerp fortsto Bergen-op-Zoom. They were opposed by the German 9thArmoured Division and a motorised division. The Germans had occupied the island of Tholen.The Belgians were withdrawing to the Antwerp line, and onthis front there were 3 German armoured divisions, 2 infantry divisions and 2 motorised divisions. Fighting had not been heavyexcept just to the north of Namur.The most serious thrust of the Germans was further to thesouth on the Namur-Sedan front, where 3 German armoured divisions and 12 infantry divisions had been identified, togetherwith some mechanised units. The axis of the German advance wasthrough Dinant, where they had crossed the Meuse, but were being-counter-attacked. They had penetrated the forward defences atSedan, but the French defences in this area were very strong anda great deal of work had been done on them recently.News received from Lord Gort that morning showed that theposition of the British Expeditionary Force was satisfactory. TheI and II Corps were in position; the II Corps was holdingLouvain, but was somewhat crowded by the Belgians on their left.The remainder of the British Expeditionary Force was moving upin depth behind the leading corps. The French mechanised divisionon the right of the B.E.F. had had a good day, and their tanks had proved much better than those of the Germans. There had been some trouble with parachutists in the Forest of Soignies and atWavre, but these had been dealt with.Movement of The Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs said that theB.E.F. through Belgian Ambassador had complained to him the previous night that,Brussels. in spite of representations, British troops were continuing to movethrough Brussels, which the Belgian Government had declared tobe an open town. He had replied that he would pass on these repre-sentations, but that the military necessities of the situation must bethe deciding factor.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that troops werenot passing through the centre of Brussels, but only through the outskirts. He undertook to supply the Foreign Secretary with thematerial for a reply to the Belgian Ambassador in order that theBelgian Government might make a public announcement of the exactsituation in this respect.Air operations. Air attacks had been made during the night on Eindhoven andAachen, but troop movements had not been able to be observed owing-to bad visibility. Similar conditions had prevailed over Maastrichtand the railway bridge crossing Hollandschdiet between Breda andDordrecht, both of which had been bombed. Enemy columns hadbeen bombed on the Breda-Rosendal and Rijsbergen roads, both ofwhich had been successfully blocked. A total of certainly 15 enemy aircraft, and probably 2 more, had been shot down in the areas ofthe B.E.F. and Rheims. There had been German air attacks on our aerodromes made by waves of 40 aircraft at a time, escorted by fighters, but comparatively little damage had been done.That morning an S.O.S. had been received from the Frenchfor air support in the Dinant-Sedan area.   Our aircraft sent in response had destroyed one bridge at Dinant and damaged another.Royal Marine Reconnaissance showed that the Rhine Barrage near KarlsruheOperation.        had been partially destroyed by the Royal Marine Operation.Activities of Reference was made to the performance of Defiant aircraft,Defiant which were 2-man fighters equipped with a power-operated turret.Fighters. They had had a successful day on the 12th May, but on the[21285] b 2
N aval operationsoff the Dutch-coast.Demolitionoil tanks.of13th May, out of a flight of 6 which had engaged enemy aircraft,only one had returned to its base. One was known to have been forced to land in Belgium, and probably a second. The other threewere missing.The destroyers which were to embark the Guards battalion from the Hook were at present fog-bound. The question ofembarking some of the Dutch army was being examined by the WarOffice and Admiralty. The importance of getting off as many aspossible was recognised (see also Minute 3 below).The 3 motor torpedo boats in the Zuyder Zee were to be reinforced by 5 60-foot boats, leaving Harwich that morning,weather permitting. These had been warned not to allow themselvesto be cut off.The Rotterdam oil tanks had been fired by demolition partiesat 4 p.m. on the 13th May and were now burning. No news hadbeen received of what was happening in this respect at Amsterdam.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Norway.Progress of operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) Con-clusions 119 C,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that a successful combined operation had been carried out at 0100 hours, the 13th May, inwhich 2 battalions of the Foreign Legion had been landed atBjervik. These should be able to join hands with the ChasseursAlpins, and it should then be possible to mop up all the germans in that particular area. There had been no determined oppositionto the landing, and casualties had probably been few.The Scots Guards had landed at Mo. A small force was holding up the advance of the Germans landed at Hemnes, who hadbeen shelled from the sea by our naval forces.No confirmation had yet been received of the presence of aGerman division at Murmansk. A cruiser would be retained innorthern waters to watch this part of the coast.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.TheNetherlands.Militarysituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 120thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad been approached that morning by the French Ambassador, whohad told him that the French Government were very disturbed bya message sent by Queen Wilhelmina to the French President, whichthey interpreted as indicating that the Netherland government might be contemplating negotiations with the Germans. He (theForeign Secretary) had told the French Ambassador that he inter-preted the message and the fact that the Netherland Governmentwere leaving the country in precisely the opposite sense, and he had subsequently seen the Netherland Foreign Minister, who had given him the same impression. The military situation was extremelydifficult, but the attitude of the Government was quite unyielding.The Netherland Foreign Minister had telegraphed to M. Gafencuin Roumania informing him that all Dutch barges on the Danubewere requisitioned by the Government and withdrawn from Germanservice.The Prime Minister pointed out that, if the Dutch resistancewas being continued, it was very important that the GuardsBattalion, which had been landed at the Hook of Holland, shouldnot be withdrawn too hastily, though it must be left to the Secretaryof State for War to decide as to the actual time of withdrawal inthe light of events.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the french ambassador had also told him that M. Reynaud was very anxious that as much of the Dutch Army as possible should be removed by sea in order to take their part in further operations in France.The War Cabinet took note of this statement, and invited the Secretary of State for War to see that all possible steps were taken to enable Dutch troops to be withdrawn from holland with our forces.Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 120thConclusions,Minute 4.)Movements of italian liners.Advice of HisMajesty&apos;ambassador atRome.Movement of australian andNew Zealandtroop convoy.4. The First Sea Lord said that the Conte cli Savoia had leftGenoa for Naples on the 13th May, and was due to return to Genoabefore sailing thence for America on the 15th May.The Chief of the Air Staff said that he had just received a french secret report, through the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,British Air Force in France, to the effect that Italian merchant ships were to be accompanied by a warship, and that from this itwas possible that Italy was seeking an excuse for entering the war against us.The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs drew the attentionof the War Cabinet to telegram No. 517 DIPP from His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Rome, dated the 14th May, in which he advised that &quot; we should not regard any verbal provocation from Italy asso intolerable as to drive us into a declaration of war.&quot; As a resultof a conversation with Count Ciano, he concluded, &quot;unless signor mussolini has already decided to take the plunge, there are three or four weeks left for him to make up his mind on militaryperformance whether to come in or not.&quot; In the meantime thecommercial talks were not going badly. He (the Foreign Secretary)concluded that we could only watch the situation from day to day and continue our preparations.The I^ord President of the Council raised the question of theaction which should be taken if, in the meantime, an&apos;Italian shipescorted by an Italian warship tried to evade our contraband control at Gibraltar.The Prime Minister said that in the first instance, at any rate,we should leave such a ship alone.The First Sea Lord said that 2 flotillas of destroyers had beenmade up and were leaving for the Mediterranean that day.The First Sea Lord said that the slow convoy from Australiawas due to arrive at Suez on the morning of the 16th Maj^. Thisconvoy had about 7,000 troops, but was already passing out of themost dangerous zone in the Red Sea. The fast convoy of big linershad left Fremantle, and if it was to be diverted round the Capea decision would have to be taken within 48 hours. It would bepossible, however, for the convoy to proceed to Colombo and be diverted from there. If it took the normal route it would not bedue to reach Suez till the 31st May.The Prime Minister hoped that the troops in this convoy wouldbe brought to the United Kingdom. The ships would be very useful for the transport of any Territorial units which it might be decidedto send out to India.The War Cabinet: (i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Agreed that unless Italy&apos;s attitude completely changed, itwould be quite unjustifiable to send the fast convoythrough the Red Sea.
Japan.Question of theDutch Bast and west Indies.(previous references:W.M. (40) 96thConclusions,Minute 5,and Con-elusions 119 A,Minute 5.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that some difficulty had arisen over the week-end as a result of our action in sending forces to the Dutch West Indies. This difficulty had been satisfactorily dealt with by the issue of a press communique to theeffect that we had no intention of changing the status quo in theDutch colonies. But on the previous day the Dutch Minister forForeign Affairs had informed him that the Japanese Governmentwere anxious lest their oil supplies from the Netherlands east indies might be cut off and he (the Foreign Secretary) had thereforeagreed to the proposal of the Dutch Minister for Foreign affairs that he should assure the Japanese Government that they need fearnothing of this kind. He had sent a similar message direct to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo, from whom he had now heard thatthe Japanese Government were satisfied with the position. TheJapanese Ambassador in London had expressed the same opinion.The Foreign Secretary undertook to make enquiries into aB.B.C. report that a meeting of Japanese Ministers had expressedthe view that the sending of Allied forces to the Dutch West Indiesconstituted a most undesirable precedent and that a violent press campaing was being stirred up against the Allies on these lines.The War Cabinet took note of this information.Eire. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked whetherPossible any thought was being given to the possibility that the GermansGerman action,   might land parachute troops in Eire.The First Lord of the A dmiralty referred to Naval IntelligenceReports which suggested German activities of various kinds going on in that country, suggestive of a &quot;fifth column.&quot;The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there was a division available in Northern Ireland which could operate againstthe Germans in Eire if necessary, but that no preparations had beenmade for the despatch of troops from this country to Eire.In the course of discussion the view was expressed that weshould at all costs avoid swinging Irish opinion against us by taking the initiative in the infringement of their neutrality, e.g.,by the seizure of ports. It was possible that the Germans werespreading rumours with the idea of tempting us into such action;but no harm could come from passing on to the Government of Eirethe information we had received.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (whenappointed) to draw the attention of the Government of eire to the possibility of a German air-borne invasion.In this connection the First Lord of the Admiralty was invited to communicate to the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs the information obtained from NavalIntelligence sources in regard to German activities in Eire.U.S.S.R.trade negotiations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 113thConclusions,Minute 12.)7. In reply to a question from the Lord President of theCouncil, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that on the7th May he had handed a Note to the Soviet Ambassador in regardto possible trade negotiations with the Soviet Government inaccordance with the decision made at the meeting referred to inthe margin. This Note had attempted to relate such negotiations tothe framework of our contraband control system. M. Maisky&apos;s immediate reaction had been to say that it would make a thoroughly
bad impression on his Government. The Soviet reply was thereforelikely to be unfriendly. The Foreign Secretary could only suggestthat the reply, when received, should be examined in the light of thegeneral political situation. The only possibility which he could at the moment envisage was that we might perhaps be able tonegotiate a purely barter agreement, not related in any way toour contraband control arrangements. It was very desirable toavoid protracted negotiations and delays, for which the SovietGovernment would hold us responsible.The War Cabinet took note of this information.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 14, 1940.
