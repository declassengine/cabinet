TheNetherlands andBelgium.German air action.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 118thConclusions,Minute 2.)Communicationwith the french high Command.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 102ndConclusions^Minute 1.)B.A.P.operations.Militarysituation.1. The War Cabinet considered a Report by the joint intelligence Sub-Committee, giving the names of a large number of places in Holland, Belgium, France and Switzerland in which german bombs were reported to have fallen. Five incendiary bombs had dropped in Kent.The Chief of the Air Staff said that he had just been speaking to the Chief of Staff to the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,British Air Forces in France, who had said that it was very difficultto get accurate information, but there was no definite indication that the Germans had departed from their policy of bombingmilitary objectives, though, of course, the interpretation of the latterterm was wide, and civilian casualties had been caused. there appeared to be no deliberate attack on the civilian population.There were reports of a few bombs being dropped at factories atClermont Ferrand.General Ismay said that, on the instructions of the First Lordof the Admiralty, he had sent a message to General Gamelin, by his staff officer in Paris. The latter had said to General Gamelin that having regard to the conclusion reached at the 8th Meeting of theSupreme War Council, and in the light of that day&apos;s events, HisMajesty&apos;s Government were inclined to put into operation the plan which had been explained at the Supreme War Council for bombingtargets in the Ruhr, including marshalling yards and oil refineries.He had then asked General Gamelin whether he agreed that thisshould be done.General Gamelin had clearly stated that it had been decided atthe Supreme War Council that we were free to carry out this plan,and that he agreed now that we should do it.The Chief of the Air Staff then gave the War Cabinet such information as was known about the air operations which were inprogress.The bombers of the Advanced Air Striking Force were operating on military objectives in accordance with the Militaryplan.The fighters had been heavily engaged during the morning, andaccording to the latest reports they had shot down about 20 enemy aircraft, but were believed to have lost 8 Hurricanes.It had been learned that Rotterdam aerodrome had been seizedby the Germans, who were landing troop-carrying aircraft on it.Fighters and bombers had accordingly been sent over to engage theenemy. The bombers were not yet back. Six Blenheim fighters hadbeen sent, of which one had so far returned. The pilot of this aircraft reported that he had found troop-carriers landing, and hadshot down two. He had then encountered a squadron ofMesserschmitts 110, but had made his escape. It was feared thatthe other 5 Blenheims might have been shot down by theMesserschmitts, though they would probably have done considerable damage to the troop-carrying aircraft.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, up to thepresent, the advance of our troops were going according to plan. Asto the enemy&apos;s progress, it appeared that although parachutists hadbeen dropped at a large number of places in Belgium, there was as yet no rush of armoured Divisions across the frontier; and, in fact,it was doubtful whether an invasion of Belgium in strength was actually taking place. It might be that the German advance wouldtake place that night, but it might also be that they had miscalculatedour reaction to their advance on Holland and Belgium, and had not expected us to advance rapidly into Belgium. In any case, itappeared that we had got a good start, and our leading troops shouldby now be on the line of the Dyle. It would take some 48 hours forthe main bodies to reach that line.[21278]b 2
Employment ofthe Britishheavy bomber force.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 113thConclusions,Minute 2.)Discussion then ensued as to the employment of the heavy bomber force during the coming night.The War Cabinet were informed that it had in any case beenarranged for those bottle-necks West of the Rhine, through whichthe main German forces must pass, to be attacked by a proportion ofthe heavy bombers during the night. It remained to decide whetherother squadrons of the heavy bomber force should be launchedagainst the marshalling yards and oil refineries in the Ruhr, orwhether they should be held back for the present, until the situation was more clearly defined.The arguments in favour of an immediate attack on military objectives in the Ruhr were stated by the Chief of the Air staff as follows : (a) The psychological effect of an immediate blow at theenemy&apos;s most vulnerable spot would be very greatthroughout the world.(b) Every day which passed made it more difficult for us to engage these targets, since the Germans would gaindepth to their defence.(c) In view of our inferiority in numbers, it had not been to our advantage to open up the air war so long as theGermans had not gone into Holland. If, however, theGermans were allowed to establish themselves in Hollandbefore we struck at their vitals, they would be able to open the air war when they were ready, and in the most favourable situation.On the other hand, the risk attaching to a decision to attack the Ruhr was that, if a critical phase shortly developed in the land battle, we might have to divert our effort in order to throw thewhole strength of our bomber force into the fight, before we had achieved any decisive result in the Ruhr.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the allied armies were now advancing into Belgium. The Germans would haveto answer by a similar advance. The Belgians would thus act asan advanced guard for the Allied armies. The latter would be ina very dangerous position until they had established themselves onthe Antwerp-Namur line. The Germans would do all in their power to delay our advance, and to overthrow the Belgian Army.Hence much would depend upon our power to hold up the german advance.The Commander-in-Chief was strongly of the opinion thatattacks on targets East of the Rhine would have no effect on the land battle. Furthermore, there was a danger that, if we startedattacking the Ruhr, and then had to switch to attacking the german army, we might end by achieving nothing decisive against eitherobjective. Fie was, therefore, in favour of holding back the attackon the Ruhr, for a short time, until it was seen how the land battlewould develop. If we succeeded in establishing ourselves on theDyle, we should have shortened the line, and saved the Belgian Army.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that it would be wise to wait for 24 hours before attacking the targets in the Ruhr.There was no doubt that we should shortly have to attack the oil refineries, and we had full justification for doing so. Nevertheless,the effect of a 24-hour delay could not make any appreciabledifference to the difficulty or danger of the attack, but it might enable a clearer view to be obtained of the situation on land.The Secretary of Slate for Air said he was much impressed with the psychological argument that if we did not strike Germanyhard and immediately, world opinion would be very critical of us.
There were a great number of instances in history of the postpone-ment of a decision leading to its never being taken. He was most anxious that we should get our blow in before the Germans got into their stride. Again, the effect of a postponement from day to dayof a hazardous operation on the crews of the bomber aircraft, whowere constantly being brought up to the pitch of enterprise, onlyto find their orders countermanded, should be fully realised. he therefore supported the Chief of the Air Staff in his contention thatthe targets in the Ruhr should be engaged forthwith.The First Sea Lord also expressed the view that the immediateopportunity to strike should not be missed.In reply to an enquiry by the First Lord of the Admiralty, theChief of the Air Staff said that if a decision were taken to attack the Ruhr, about 40 heavy bombers would take part in the attackon the first night. The attack would be sustained each night bya similar number until results were achieved.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that if we delayedour attack and the Germans bombed our bomber aerodromes that night, they would not have a much better target than they wouldhave if these 40 bombers had been despatched. He therefore feltthat this was a risk which would be present each night, and mustbe accepted.The Prime Minister said that after hearing the arguments, hewas in favour of postponing an attack on objectives East of the rhine, at any rate for 24 hours.It was agreed That  no  air  attack  should  be  made  on  the  night^lOth-llth May on objectives East of the Rhine, but thatthe matter should be further considered the following day in the light of the military situation.TheNetherlands.Interviewbetween theSecretary ofState forForeign affairs and the DutchForeignMinister.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 118thConclusions,Minute 3.)Protection of oil refineries inAruba andCuracao.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 117thConclusions.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad that afternoon seen the Dutch Foreign Minister, who, with theDutch Minister for the Colonies had come to this country in orderto provide the nucleus of a Dutch Government in the event of holland being completely over-run. If, however, conditionspermitted, they intended to return to Holland. The Dutch ForeignMinister had said that the Dutch now regarded themselves as oneof the Allies. His latest information before leaving Holland hadbeen that the Eastern Front was holding. The aerodrome at TheHague had changed hands twice, while the aerodome at Amsterdamhad been destroyed. No decision had been reached as to whether the queen of the Netherlands should come to this country.Other information given by the Dutch Foreign minister concerned territorial waters, the sowing of magnetic mines, trading with the enemy, and the Dutch stock of gold. This last information had been passed on to the Admiralty.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had broached thesubject of our proposed action at Curacao and Aruba. The DutchForeign Minister had taken a favourable view, though he had shown some concern as to how the matter would be presented to the world.Agreement had been reached that this should take the form of an exchange of Notes, the text of which was being drafted at theForeign Office.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
Belgium.Progress ofGermaninvasion.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 118thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a report whichhad just been received at the War Office from the Military Attache,Brussels. This stated that general mass air attacks had begun onBelgian aerodromes in the early hours of that morning, and that german parachutists had landed at various points behind theBelgian defences. Some of these parachutists had carried dummiesdressed in khaki, and one such had been brought to G.H.Q.The advance elements of the German Army, including infantry and tanks, had, at 1100 hours, been across the Belgian frontier east of Liege, but had not yet reached the Belgian line of defences.Demolitions had been carried out on the Maas and all bridgeshad been destroyed except the main railway bridge.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Invasion ofGreat Britain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 117thConclusions.)Action to betaken againstGermanparachutists.Move of pioneer corps: Germanrefugee unit.4. On a point raised by the Secretary of State for War, theWar Cabinet-(a) Took note that the Connnander-in-Chief, Home Forces,would issue a warning giving instructions to troopsabout the action which they should take againstparachutists attempting to land in this country.(b) Invited the Minister for Home Security to issue comple-mentary instructions to the Civil Defence authorities.On a point raised by the Minister for Home Security, the WarCabinet Invited the Secretary of State for War to move the unit of the Pioneer Corps now in the Dpver-Richborough area,and which comprised German refugees in British uniform,to a more suitable area.The WarCabinet.Resignation ofthe PrimeMinister.5. The Prime Minister said that, as his colleagues were aware,the Labour Party had been asked whether they would consider inprinciple co-operating in the Government (a) under the present prime Minister, or (b) under some other Prime Minister. TheLabour Party&apos;s answer had now been received. Their reply to thefirst question was in the negative and to the second question was asfollows : &quot; The Labour Party are prepared to take their share ofresponsibility as a full partner in a new Government, under anew Prime Minister, which would command the confidence ofthe nation.&quot;The Prime Minister said that, in the light of this answer, hehad reached the conclusion that the right course was that he should at once tender his resignation to The King. He proposed to do sothat evening. He thought it would be convenient that the newPrime Minister should be authorised to assume that all members ofthe War Cabinet placed their resignations at the disposal of thenew Prime Minister, when sent for by The King, and that therewas no necessity for this to be confirmed in writing. In the mean-time, of course, Ministers remained in office and would continue todischarge their functions until a new Administration had beenformed.The War Cabinet agreed to the course suggested.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,May 10, 1940.
