Evacuation ofCivil population from East andSouth-east coast Towns.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 181stConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Minister of Home Security described the present stateof the plan for the evacuation of the civil population from Eastand South-East coast towns.The following is a summary of the main points in his statement and the discussion which ensued : (i) The scheme had originated in a recommendation from theChiefs of Staff for the evacuation of children, pregnantwomen and old persons.(ii) It had grown into a scheme for the compulsory evacuation of all but essential people, based, not on the safety ofthe people concerned, but on the military need of avoiding the congestion of roads by refugees in theevent of invasion.(iii) It had not been intended to put into operation the com-pulsory part of the scheme until invasion was clearlyimminent, but it had been stipulated that three days&apos;notice was necessary, i.e., 24 hours before the move could being and 48 hours to carry it out. The Chiefs of staff had been unable to guarantee any warning, and it had therefore been proposed that plans should be made whichwould enable the compulsory scheme to be put into opera-tion forthwith.(iv) The compulsory scheme was now ready to be put into effecton Monday next, the 1st July.(v) Whereas, however, it had been assumed that these planswould affect some 60 per cent, of the population of the towns concerned, the scheme which had been worked out would result in the evacuation of 90 per cent. This hadbeen due, in part to the insistence of Departments thatthe evacuation should cover the removal of workers engaged on the production of war material.(vi) The preparation of plans for compulsory evacuation had produced a large voluntary evacuation, reaching 40 percent, in the South-East coast towns, and not less than25 per cent, in East Anglia; and this would probably be worked up to something not far short of 60 per cent.(vii) The complete scheme would involve the evacuation of250,000 to 300,000 persons, and would entail compulsorybilleting on a scale never before contemplated. So heavy a burden could be justified in the face of an obviousmilitary necessity, but not as a purely precautionarymeasure.(viii) That invasion would probably not affect the whole coast-line but only two or three points. It would thereforebe unreasonable to denude the whole coast unless military considerations made this imperative,(ix) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and theCommander-in-Chief\ Home Forces, said that from themilitary point of view complete evacuation of this coastalstrip would undoubtedly help, but was not essential.Arrangements had been made to allot roads for the useof refugees, and most of the remaining population couldbe moved if and when necessary, by &quot;tactical&quot; trains.By a further tightening-up of these and similar arrange-ments it should be possible to meet the situation withoutcompulsory evacuation, provided that voluntaryevacuation was stimulated.The War Cabinet agreed (1) That the scheme for the compulsory evacuation of all butessential people from the nineteen East Coast townsbetween Great Yarmouth and Folkestone should not be[21467] b 2
The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 183rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy activity.bomber command.2. The Chief of the Air Staff gave the following information to supplement that contained in Cabinet War Room RecordNo. 298 :-Enemy raiders on the night 26th-27th June had come in on four main lines of approach between the Isle of Wight and Scotland,at heights varying from 3,000 to 10,000 feet. Bombing had beenvery sporadic, and in many cases it was difficult to understand what targets the enemy had been aiming at. In general, however,attacks had been directed against aerodromes and industrial estab-lishments. It was known that many of the German bomber unitshad been sent back to rest and reorganise, and it must be expectedthat the previous night&apos;s scale of attack would be greatly exceededlater. We had brought down two enemy aircraft for certain, andone probable.A standing fighter patrol was now maintained by the enemyover the Boulogne-Calais area, and R.D.F. reported a permanentecho at 6,000 feet which might indicate a balloon barrage. Thiswould be investigated.Reports of night bombing operations on the night25th-26th June had now been received. Weather had hamperedthe work of our aircraft, but successful attacks had been made onBorkum, Bremen and Hamburg, and many German aerodromes.Lack of cloud cover had hampered day bombing on the26th June, but the oil plant at Gelsenkirchen had been successfullybombed. Schipol aerodrome and the Soest marshalling yard had also been bombed.One hundred and one heavy bombers had been despatched onthe night 26th-27th June against aluminium works in the Ruhr,aerodromes and railway targets.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 183rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Middle East.Raids on theenemy coast.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that fivemen and one armoured car of the 11th Hussars patrol, who hadbeen missing after penetrating into Libya, had returned. TheSollum ridge had been shelled by an enemy warship.The raids reported in the Press of the previous day on thecoast of France occupied by the enemy had been small operationsonly, carried out by parties of about 100 men.It was generally felt that the publicity given to raids on sucha small scale was most unfortunate, and would render other opera-tions more difficult. An enquiry into the circumstances in whichthis wide publicity had been given was being carried out in theAdmiralty and War Office.put into operation for the present. A scheme on thescale now proposed should not be carried out except asa military necessity, in the face of invasion or imminentinvasion.(2) That the plans for compulsory evacuation should, however,be held in readiness, so that the scheme could be putinto effect at short notice.(3) That in the meantime, the Minister of Home Securityshould take steps to stimulate the voluntary evacuation of the civil population&apos; from these towns so far aspracticable up to the level of, say, 60 per cent, of thepopulation.
The naval situation.(PreviousIlef erence:W.M. (40) 183rdConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The First Sea Lord gave the following information to supplement that contained in Cabinet War Room Record No. 298.The &quot;cutting out&quot; expedition to round up ships in the Girondehad found only French ships there.A report had been received that S.S. British Monarch, bound for Glasgow with iron ore, had been torpedoed. It would be possibleto strengthen the anti-submarine patrols operating in the western approaches, now that the heavy calls on destroyers made duringthe evacuation period were over.The Italian warships in the Red Sea consisted of one oldcruiser and 8 destroyers, 4 of which were modern ships. These sofar as we knew were in the harbour at Massawa. Owing to theposition of Massawa it would be very difficult to attack these shipswhile in harbour except from the air.The submarine Grampus, operating in the Mediterranean, wasoverdue and must be considered lost. The submarine Odin had failed to answer wireless signals and was also overdue.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.France.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 183rdConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The War Cabinet were given the latest information as&apos;regards the French Fleet.A record of the discussion, and of the conclusions reached, is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.France.The SmileBertin.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 183rdConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The First Sea Lord said that a report had been receivedfrom the senior naval officer at Martinique that the French Admiralintended to land the bullion in Emile Bertin for safe custody inMartinique. He had given assurances that it would not be allowedto fall into the hands of Germany. The senior naval officer had been told to find out whether the Polish gold was on board Emile Bertinor not. The whereabouts of the Manager of the Bank of poland was not known, but it was possible that he might be on board theaircraft carrier Beam, which had been thought to be bound forMartinique but had not yet been located. The Emile Bertin wouldnot be allowed to leave Martinique.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.France.Evacuation offoreign troops.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 181stConclusions,Minute 10.)7. The First Sea Lord said that the total number of Polesevacuated from France amounted probably to over 20,000.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to informthe Prime Minister of the details, by numbers and categories, of theforeign troops which had been evacuated from France.
8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that GeneralDillon had reported that there was now no hope of any french resistance in North Africa. General Nogues had informed him that the senior officers in the Air Force were not willing to resist,and with the attitude of the French Fleet so uncertain he could do nothing.   General Nogues had now left for Rabat.Information had been received from our Mission in Syria thatGeneral Mittelhauser also had given up hope. His attitude wasthat North Africa was the key to the situation, and that with all hope gone of setting up a French Government in North Africathere was nothing more that he could do. The British Missionemphasised the importance of getting out a scheme immediately to deal with those elements in the French Army in Syria who wereprepared to fight on our side. Arrangements would also have to bemade to move the Polish brigade now in Syria into Palestine.The Prime Minister said that it looked as though there was little chance now of any resistance in the French African Colonies.The Minister of Information had telegraphed to him that he hadnot been permitted to see the French ex-Ministers at Rabat, whowere being treated almost as prisoners.The War Cabinet Took note of the above statements, and invited the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff to submit to the PrimeMinister later in the day a draft of the telegram to besent to General Wavell, as to the arrangements proposed for dealing with the French elements in Syria who were willing to continue to fight with us, and as to the polish troops in Syria.France.French armed forces in the united kingdom.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 183rdConclusions,Minute 10.)9. Discussion took place as to the action to be taken in regardto French forces now in this country.The PHms Minister suggested that before these troops were told that they could leave this country, General de Gaulle shouldbe given an opportunity of addressing them, and inviting those who wished to continue to fight to be formed into French units underFrench officers. It would probably be desirable to give them Britishrates of pay.The War Cabinet-Agreed that, if possible, we should avail ourselves of theservices of any reliable elements in the French forces nowin this country, and, in particular, of any complete units.A decision as to the steps to be taken in this matter wasdeferred to a further Meeting to be held later in the day.France.Proposed air attacks onindustrialobjectives in occupied french territory.10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that the Committee which was considering urgentproblems arising out of the collapse of French resistance had urgedthat early action should be taken to bomb certain aircraft andaeroplane engine factories in French territory occupied by theGermans, before anti-aircraft defences could be installed by theenemy.Position in french Colonies.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 183rdConclusions,Minute 7.)
The War Cabinet (i) Expressed general approval of the suggestion.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to prepare plans for action, on the lines proposed. The plans should notbe put into operation without further reference to theWar Cabinet.Ireland.defence negotiations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 182ndConclusions,Minute 1.)11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that in the course of a conversation on the previous day with the United States Ambassador, he had told him the steps which we had been taking in connection with the defence of Ireland.The Ambassador had said that he would inform President Rooseveltand ask him to bring pressure on Mr. de Valera to co-operate with us on the lines proposed.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Japan.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 181stConclusions,Minute 7.)12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hoped to submit a Paper to the War Cabinet&apos;very shortly, suggestinga line of policy to be adopted in our relations with Japan.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W.June 27, 1940.
