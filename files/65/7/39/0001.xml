1. The Prime Minister said that the Belgian Army had ceasedfire at 0400 hours that morning. He invited Admiral Sir RogerKeyes, who had just returned from Belgium, to give the WarCabinet his appreciation of the present position.Sir Roger Keyes said that the Belgian Army had been com-pletely demoralised by incessant bombing from large numbers ofGerman aircraft. The Germans appeared to have maintained a ringof fighter patrols round the battle area and, although our fighters had been seen in many engagements with the German fighters, theyhad been unable to break through the ring in order to attack theGerman bombers, which had circled round at low altitudes, bombingthe Belgian troops with impunity.Sir Roger Keyes commented on the precipitate flight of theBelgian Government. King Leopold had said that he wished to have nothing more to do with them. In his (Sir Roger Keyes&apos;s) view theBelgian Government were entirely responsible for the chaos causedby the evacuation of the civil population, who had been told thatasylum would be found for them in England or France. It hadbeen noticeable that the Local Authorities had in most cases beenthe first to get away.Position of the He had seen Lord Gort on the 26 th May, but had been unableB.E.F. to get in touch with him on the 27th.   Lord Gort&apos;s headquartershad been at Cassel, but they had later been shelled out of the town.Lord Gort, who was in very good heart, had said that any attackto the southward was out of the question. Although Lord Gorthad not said so, Sir Roger Keyes did not think that he rated very high the chances of extricating the B.E.F. from their dangerous situation.Sir Roger Keyes thought, however, that it might be possiblefor the line of the Yser to be held to cover the retirement. Therewere indications that British troops were within 10 miles ofNieuport. The flood waters were rising rapidly and tanks wouldbe unable to move except on the roads. The latter were in good condition, but were crowded with Belgian guns and transport.Referring to the efforts of the British Government to persuade the King of the Belgians to leave the country, Sir Roger Keyesexpressed the view that only the King&apos;s personality had held theBelgian Army together for the last four days. If the King had left when pressed to do so by His Majesty&apos;s Government three days ago, the morale of the Army would have cracked at once. he asked that he might be sent back to Dunkirk where he thought thathis presence might be of value in preventing panic.The Prime Minister expressed the War Cabinefs warm appre-ciation of what Sir Roger Keyes had done in such difficult and dangerous circumstances. He did not think, however, that sir roger Keyes should return to Belgium, at any rate for the moment.(At this point Sir Roger Keyes withdrew.)The Prime Minister said that the King of.the Belgians would now presumably become the puppet of Hitler, and might possiblyobtain better treatment for his people than if he had left thecountry and continued to resist from foreign soil. No doubt historywould criticise the King for having involved us and the French in belgium&apos;s ruin.  But it was not for us to pass judgment on him.Later in the meeting Lieut.-Col. Davy gave the War Cabinetfurther information on the operations of the Belgian Army. Hehad left the King and the Belgian Army at 8 p.m. the previous evening. All credit should be given to the Belgians in any publicannouncements for their loyal co-operation with the B.E.F. through-out the retirement. They had met all our requests for readjust-ments of boundaries, movements of rear guards, &amp;c, without demur.On the line of the Escaut they had successfully counter-attacked[21355a] b 2Capitulation ofthe Belgian Army.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 143rdConclusions.)
the German bridgeheads established across the river. When theyhad reached the line of the Lys, they had pointed out that therewas no other line on which they could retire which had an anti-tank obstacle, except the Yser, which was three days&apos; march away.This was too big a withdrawal to be carried out successfully.It was for this reason that they had decided to fight it out on theline of the Lys. On the first day the Germans had pushed bridge-heads across, but most of these had been driven back by the Belgians.Even when the Belgians had been thrown back five miles behind the Lys, they had again counter-attacked. For the last three daysthey had been subjected to incessant low-flying bombing and machine-gunning. They had had virtually no air support of theirown, and the British fighters had been unable to get through tothem as they had had to expend all their ammunition dealing wuhthe German aircraft further to the seaward. In one counter-attack,which had been staged by the Belgians after an hours artillerybombardment north-west of Ghent, the whole of the artillery hadbeen destroyed by dive-bombers about half an hour after the bombardment had begun. A Belgian battalion which had been sentdown to try and fill the gap between the Belgians and the Britishto the east of Ypres, had been wiped out by a wave of 60 enemy bombers.The King had done all he could, ever since it had become apparent that the British Expeditionary Force might have to fallback on the ports, to support its withdrawal. His artillery hadbeen ordered to remain at their guns until the Germans reachedthem, and then to destroy them. The Belgian losses had probably been very heavy indeed. They had inflicted heavy losses on theGerman infantry, but through lack of aircraft had been able to dovery little against the German guns or aircraft.The Prime Minister thanked Lieut.-Col. Davy for theinformation he had given.(At this point Lieut.-Col. Davy withdrew.)The Prime Minister then read to the War Cabinet the termsof the armistice which the Belgians had agreed with the enemy,as follows : (1) All Belgian troop movements forbidden.   Belgian troopsmust line up on the side of the road to await orders.They must make known their presence by means of whitesigns, flags, &amp;c.(2) Orders must be given forbidding destruction of war material and stores.(3) Geimian troops must be allowed to proceed to the coast.(4) Free passage to Ostend is demanded and no destructionpermitted.^ , . (5) All resistance will be overcome.Belgian overseas &apos;possessions. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had had a visit from the Belgian Ambassador, who had repeated thestatement broadcast by the Belgian Prime Minister that the BelgianGovernment dissociated themselves entirely from the action takenby King Leopold. They were the only legal constitutional Govern-ment of Belgium and they would continue the struggle. He proposedto urge the Belgian Ambassador to ensure that immediate tele-grams were sent to Belgian overseas possessions to inform themthat their Government had not surrendered.The War Cabinet :-(1) Took note of the above discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to ensurethat the Governments of Belgian overseas possessionswere informed without delay that the Belgian Govern-ment had not surrendered.
1 ooI 0 3The western front.Progress of operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 143rdConclusions.)Arrangementsfor withdrawal.Information forthe public.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theGermans were evidently pushing in two main forces, one throughthe Belgians and the other across the canal in the Hazebrouck area.The latter was believed to consist of 5 to 8 armoured divisions,supported by motor divisions. At the bottom of the pocket therewas little pressure by the Germans, and the withdrawal there wasbeing covered by small rear guards only. The 4 British divisions inthe old fortifications would probably fall back to the line of the Lysthat night. We did not know what the state of the roads was inthat area, but they were probably extremely congested. The totalnumber of men in the area encircled by the Germans was probablyabout 200,000. There were another 160,000 in France not engagedin the operations in the north.The First Sea Lord said that the Vice-Admiral, Dover, had reported at 11 a.m. that 11,400 men had arrived the previous night and 2,500 more were in passage across the Channel. There were5 destroyers alongside at Dunkirk, each of which was taking onabout 1,000 men. Considerable numbers of troops were arrivingback at Dunkirk.A later message from Captain Tennant at Dunkirk reportedthat there were 2,000 troops on the beaches and 7,000 among thesand dunes. All these were very badly in need of water, whichthe Army could not supply. Vice-Admiral, Dover, had informed him that a maximum effort would be made that night to send inflat bottomed boats to take these men off the beaches. Embarka-tion by this means was impossible by day owing to machine-gunfire. Destroyers, however, would be taking men off the quaysthroughout the day. Practically all the men arriving at Dunkirkhad their equipment with them, and most of them had their rifles.Many also carried their Bren guns.A message had been received that S.S. Aboukir, which had leftOstend on the night of the 27th May with about 1,000 men onboard, including the British Missions to the Belgians, had been torpedoed, probably by a motor torpedo boat, in the early hours ofthat morning.  Thirty-three survivors had been picked up.S.S. Queen of the Channel, transporting troops, had been bombed and was in a sinking condition, but it was believed that the survivors had been taken off.Dunkirk itself was covered with a pall of smoke, and Vice-Admiral, Dover, had been instructed to use smoke from ships to add to this if needed.The Secretary of State for War said that the troops evacuated from France were being despatched at once from the ports ofdisembarkation to Salisbury Plain and Aldershot Command. Theywould be attached to parent units in these places, who would rationthem and look after them.The Chief of the Air Staff said that he had ordered continuousfighter patrols in strength during daylight hours over Dunkirkand the beaches three miles on either side of the town. The othertasks allotted to Fighter Command were the protection of our. ownbomber sorties and patrols over the B.E.F. area.The Minister of Information read to the War Cabinet a message he had just received from Sir Walter Monckton pressing for a frank statement of the desperate situation of the british expeditionary Force. He feared that, unless this was given out,public confidence would be badly shaken and the civil population would not be ready to accept the assurances of the Government ofthe chances of our ultimate victory. The Minister suggested thathe should make a short statement in the 1 o&apos;clock news of theB.B.C.The Prime Minister said that he would also make a statement in the House of Commons in the afternoon to the effect that the[21355a]b 3
British Expeditionary Force was fighting its way back to the coastunder the protection of the Royal Air Force, and that the Navywas embarking the troops. It would be idle to try to forecast thesuccess of this operation at this stage.Later in the meeting the Minister of Information read outthe terms of the broadcast which he proposed to make.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved the terms of the broadcast by the Minister ofInformation.(ii) Invited the Prime Minister to make a statement in theHouse of Commons that afternoon.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 141stConclusions,Minute 2.)Air fighting onthe 27th May.3. The Chief of the Air Staff said that 50 German aircraft,confirmed, had been destroyed the previous day including 20 bombers,and 29, including 10 bombers, unconfirmed. We had lost 14 fighters,but in addition 40 to 50 fighters had been rendered temporarilyunserviceable. A total of 81 fighters would probably be put into service that day from new production and repair. Large numbersof enemy aircraft had almost certainly been rendered unserviceableas a result of combats. These had not been included in the figuresfor the enemy losses which he had given.The Chief of the Air Staff said that he had issued a specialorder to all Commanders-in-Chief on the previous day emphasising the need for exceptional efforts to support the B.E.F. and the naval forces carrying out the evacuation. He had also ordered the air officer Command ing-in-Chief, Fighter Command, to maintaincontinuous patrols in strength over Dunkirk and the beaches three miles east and west of it; to provi de escorts for bomber sorties, and support to the B.E.F. itself. He had just received a message fromthe Vice-Chief of the Air Staff who reported that the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief was deeply concerned at the effect of this order on the air defence of Great Britain. Our fighter defenceswere almost at cracking point. If this exceptional effort had tobe repeated over Dunkirk on the following day, the situation wouldbe serious. The Chief of the Air Staff said that he could not acceptthe statement that our fighter defences were at cracking point, buthe thought it only right to bring to the notice of the War Cabinetthe view of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief.The Prime Minister observed that the enemy might perhapstake advantage of the situation to send in a heavy attack againstthe United Kingdom. Our fighter defences might have to be re-disposed to meet it, but no doubt the enemy was fully extended likeourselves.The War. Cabinet took note of the above statement.Norway.Progress of operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 141stConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Hurricanes hadflown off H.M.S. Glorious. The Gladiators had shot down some4-engined bombers. A report had been received that there was someshortage of ammunition for our aircraft, and H.M.S. Glorious had turned back to land some. There were 42 tons of ammunition at narvik, but it was possible, of course, that some of this had been destroyed by enemy action.
Invasion of 5.   The Lord President of the Council drew attention to theGreat Britain. various indications recently that a German move from Norway wasPossibility of a impending. There had been reports of troop movements from east german invasion to west in Southern Norway, and neutral missions in Berlin and Oslofrom Norway.    had been stopped from sending cypher messages since the 24th May.The Chiefs of Staff had themselves drawn attention to the need for obtaining all information about possible German expeditions, andhe suggested that special attention might be given at this time to norway. The Germans might perhaps be intending a raid onScotland.The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet of the presentdispositions of our naval forces in home waters. He did not thinka seaborne expedition was practicable, although there was, of course,the chance that, if the Germans were willing to take the risk, itmight slip through in bad visibility. We had submarines watchingfor movement from the Bight, the Skagerrak and the coasts of norway.   Air reconnaissances were also being carried out.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that an air reconnaissanceon the previous day had found nothing in the Norwegian fjordsexcept two ships.The War Cabinet-Instructed the Chiefs of Staff to pay special attention tothe completeness of our reconnaissance arrangements offthe Norwegian coast, and to make a special report on thefollowing day on the likelihood of a German expeditionfrom Norway directed against this country.Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 142ndConclusions.)Approach byPresidentRoosevelt to signor mussolini.Suggested direct approach to signor mussolini.Possible plan forblocking the suez Canal.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 138thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 841, dated the27th May, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington,which read as follows : &apos;&apos; Under-Secretary of State to-day informed me that the response of Signor Mussolini to the Presidents com-munication had been entirely negative. He did not,however, expect action by Italy for the next few days. then said to him that I thought the next and mostimportant point would be Spain and that anything theUnited States Government did to encourage Spain toremain neutral would be of the utmost importance fromthe point of view both of Gibraltar and Portugal. the under-Secretary of State agreed, but said that he did notthink that Spain would abandon her neutrality untilFranco had been got rid of.&quot;In regard to the French suggestions for a direct approach to signor Mussolini, a telegram had been sent to the French Govern-ment on the lines approved by the War Cabinet on the previous evening. M. Corbin had been told of the gist of the message andit seemed that his personal judgment had agreed with our own.The First Sea Lord reported that the Italian aircraft carrierMaraglia had disembarked her aircraft at Benghazi and returnedto Naples. The question of safeguarding the Suez Canal against possible action by this ship therefore did not arise.
 . _____Home Defence.Action to dealwith FifthColumndangers:proposed HomeDefence(Security)Executive.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 141stConclusions,Minute 9 (3).)Home Defence.Constitution ofHome defence executive.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40)-132ndConclusions,Minute 12.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (40) 173) setting out proposals in regard to the constitution and staffing, of the Home defence executive.The Lord President of the Council said that he had already beengiven full powers in this matter by the War Cabinet, but that hehad thought it right to ask for their covering approval for the actionwhich he had taken.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff had under consideration at the moment the question of the actual controlof all the Forces and Services in this country in the event of an invasion. It seemed possible that under the existing plans controlmight still be in the hands of a Committee, which would not be satisfactory. The Chiefs of Staff were not, however, yet in a positionto submit a definite recommendation.The Prime Minister pointed out that it was equally important not to overlook the need for decentralisation of responsibility aswell as for full co-ordination at the centre.The War Cabinet-(1) Gave covering approval to the action by the Lord Presidentof the Council in the matter of the Home defence executive as set out in his Memorandum (W.P. (40) 172).(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to put forward proposals inregard to the control of the Forces and Services in thiscountry in the event of invasion.Diversion ofShipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 131stConclusions,Minute 11.)9. The First L,ord of the Admiralty reminded the WarCabinet that, at the Meeting referred to in the margin, it had beenagreed that the initiative of raising the question of putting intooperation the scheme for the diversion of shipping should rest withhim. Both he and the Minister of Transport considered that thetime had now come to issue the pre-arranged code telegrams(Painstaker Aggravated Generally) to the Port Emergency Com-mittees. This would cause practically no dislocation of the workingof the ports, but would ensure that the preparations were broughtto a high state of readiness and that the arrangements could be putinto force for any of the ports concerned as soon as necessary.The War Cabinet Approved the proposal that telegrams should be sent to port Emergency Committees, as proposed above, in preparation for any diversion of shipping that might benecessary.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council, describing the action which he hadalready taken to deal with the danger of Fifth Column activities(W.P. (40) 172).The Lord President of the Council said that the Home Defence(Security) Executive which was being set up under the Chairman-ship of Lord Swinton as described in his Memorandum was holdingits first meeting that morning, and would take any necessary action.There was nothing further for which he required the authority ofthe War Cabinet.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
1 Q ^1-0:3289W.M. 144 (40),naval construction.Suspension of long-term programme.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 67thConclusions,Minute 8.)10. The First Lord of the Admiralty said it was proposed tosend telegrams ordering an immediate suspension of work on certainships under construction as part of our long-term naval programme in order to concentrate the maximum effort on speeding up theconstruction of vessels that might become available in the nearfuture. The vessels affected by the suspension included the battle-ships Anson, Hoive, Lion, Temeraire and Vanguard; the aircraft carrier Indefatigable; the cruisers of the 1939 Programme; and theFourth Emergency Destroyer Flotilla.The Minister without Portfolio said that the production council were receiving every possible assistance from the admiralty and the other Service Departments in their task of concentratingour productive resources on the most immediate requirements. he wished to emphasise that the suspension of work now ordered wastemporary and would be reconsidered as soon as the presentimmediate crisis was over.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.newspapers.The Press. 11.   The Secretary of State for the Home Department and power to deal Minister of Home Security said that he had been consideringwith subversive whether further powers were needed to deal with newspapers suchas Action and the Daily Worker which were systematically andcontinually fomenting opposition to the successful prosecution ofthe war. He had intended to raise the matter in the Home PolicyCommittee, but the Lord Privy Seal had suggested that the matterought to come before the War Cabinet. Under the present regula-tions, action could only be taken in a number of successive stages,which included a successful prosecution in the Courts. This would necessarily mean some considerable delay. He therefore proposedthat a new Defence Regulation should be made to confer on theExecutive power by Order to prohibit the printing, publication or&quot; X&quot; I distribution of any newspaper which systematically publishedmatter of the kind in question. Power would also be taken to closedown any printing press used in the production of such a news-paper.He proposed that there should be a right of application to theHigh Court for leave to use a printing press closed down in thisway in any case where it could be shown that the use of the press for the production of the offending newspaper had been &quot; due toa mistake.&quot; If the Regulations were made, he would propose,before taking any action in any particular case, to consult the HomeDefence (Security) Executive, which would enable them to share the responsibility with him and would not involve any delay.There was general agreement with the view that the assump-tion of these exceptional powers was fully justified in the presentsituation. At the same time, it would be right that the WarCabinet should be kept informed generally of the use made of the severy wide powers.The War Cabinet agreed : That a Defence Regulation giving the powers proposed at&quot;X&quot; above should be submitted forthwith for theapproval of His Majesty in Council.
