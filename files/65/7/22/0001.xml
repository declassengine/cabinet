(40) 118thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Prime Minister said that on the whole the military-situation in France was better. The French were bringing uptroops, and French artillery had had some success in destroyingGerman tanks. The Royal Air Force had covered themselves withglory.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Frenchline to the south-east of the Bulge appeared to have been con-solidated. A French counter-attack at Laon had met with little opposition and that corner of the Bulge had been cleared up. TheFrench held Maubeuge, but further west the Germans were reportedto have four bridge-heads over the River Sambre at Ribemont,Longchamps, Landrecies, and east of the Forest of Mormal. TheFrench and the B.E.F. were making a second defensive position on the line Valenciennes, Cambrai, Peronne. There was, at present,little activity in the Bulge.The Chief of the Air Staff said that there had been a markeddiminution in German bomber activity on the previous day, both inthe Bulge and near Brussels. Only two of the six fighter formationsworking from Kent had made contact with the enemy, and all theaircraft engaged had returned safely. The relative losses in thefighting in which our fighters had been engaged the previous day hadbeen as follows : British : 7 lost, 6 not yet accounted for.German ; 31 shot down plus 5 unconfirmed.In one of these engagements, 5 Hurricanes had attacked40 Messerschmitts 110. Six Messerschmitts had been shot down, but our total casualties had been only one Hurricane lost, and onedamaged. Moreover, we had lost no pilots. A second formation ofMesserschmitts encountered shortly afterwards had refused combatand turned away.On the other hand 12 Blenheims had been attacked early on theprevious morning by 15 Messerschmitts 109 and only one had returned.132 heavy bombers had carried out operations during theprevious night. Some 50 of these aircraft had attacked targetsselected by the French.Between 40 and 50 bombers had attacked German oil installations. The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, bomber command, had reported that the German oil installations at hamburg and Bremen had been destroyed. Our bombers had met with little opposition and had all returned safely.Bombing attacks had also been carried out on marshalling yards at a number of places.The French had asked for fluvial mines to be laid by aircraft in the Meuse.The Minister of Information said that our air attacks onobjectives in Germany were being hushed up or minimized by theGermans. The inference appeared to be that they were not readyto retaliate.The First Sea Lord said that, in accordance with the PrimeMinister&apos;s orders, the blockships for Zeebrugge and Ostend hadnot carried out their operation the previous night, but would beheld in home waters in immediate readiness. Demolitions atFlushing had been begun on the previous evening.The Prime Minister said that the blocking operations shouldbe postponed from day to day, but that the ships should be readyto carry them out immediately if the situation so demanded. TheFrench should be informed that this task would be our sole respon-sibility.[21298] b 2
Later in the meeting, the First Lord of the Admiralty reportedthat bombing off the Belgian Coast was so heavy that it would notbe possible to continue mine-sweeping operations much longer. If,therefore, the blockships for Ostend and Zeebrugge were not movedat once, they might be mined on the way over. He, therefore,proposed that they should sail that afternoon in order to be putinto position on the following morning.   This was agreed to.The War Cabinet took note of the above statementsThe naval situation.Naval reinforce-ments for theMediterranean.(previous reference erence:W.M.

(40) 124thConclusions,Minute 8.)2. The First Sea Lord reported that the third group of reinforcements for the Mediterranean would all arrive at Gibraltaron the 20th May.It had now been confirmed that there was a German raiderin the southern Atlantic. This vessel, which was an armedmerchantman, had been sighted by a British ship, and appropriatenaval dispositions were being taken to deal with it.The Italian liner Rex, homeward bound from America, hadnot called at Gibraltar, but the Conte di Savoia had called therevoluntarily on her outward voyage.The First Sea Lord gave details of the dispositions of naval forces in the North Sea.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Norway. 3.

The Chief of the Air Staff said that a Messerschmitt 110 hadbeen shot down by Blenheims at Bergen and two further german aircraft had been shot down at Mo.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Iceland. 4.   The First Sea Lord reported that two transports and the arrival of destroyer escort, with 3,800 troops on board, had arrived at british Reyjavik at noon on the 17th May.   Disembarkation of troops hadreinforcements, begun the same afternoon. -(Previous The War QaDinet took note of the akove statement.Kef erence:W.M. (40) 124th __Conclusions,Minute 6.)
United States of 5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadAmerica. been informed by the Ministry of Information that the UnitedPress comments States Press correspondents in London thought that United states in Great Britain, opinion was moving very rapidly in the direction of the Allies.This movement might, however, be seriously compromised if any-public statement were made on it, especially by a member of theGovernment. The Foreign Secretary added that he fully sharedthis view.The Minister of Information said that, at his Press conference the previous morning, he had asked the Press to damp downcomments on the United States attitude; what had been published that morning was very moderate.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Netherland east indies.BeportedJapanesedemands.(PreviousBet erence:W.M. (40) 121stConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 785 of the 16th May, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Tokyo. The Japanese Government had made a communication to the Netherland Government setting out a numberof economic advantages which they wished the Netherland Govern-ment to grant to Japan in the Netherland East Indies. TheForeign Secretary proposed to instruct Sir Robert Craigie, by telegram, to take the matter up with the Japanese Government, ifhe considered that these demands were as sinister as they appearedto be. These telegrams were being repeated to Washington, andhe would inform the United States Government.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 336, dated the 16th May, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;sEgypt.Unidentifiedbomber aircraft  Ambassador, Cairoto be fired on incertaincircumstances.The Rear-Admiral-in-Charge, Alexandria, had enquire whether unidentified formations of bomber aircraft which didnot obey the prohibited area regulations should now be regardedas hostile, and, if so, whether fire might be opened on them withlive ammunition. Sir Miles Lampson said that military and civil aircraft of many nationalities passed through Alexandria,and that the action proposed presented dangers. On the otherhand, the first act of war might be an attack by the Italian AirForce on Alexandria harbour. Sir Miles Lampson suggestedthat, on receipt of a telegram from the Foreign Secretary thatthere was an imminent danger of war with Italy, he should atonce inform the Rear-Admiral-in-Charge, Alexandria, who should be authorised then, but not before, to act as proposed.The Foreign Secretary thought that the action proposedinvolved too great a risk of an incident, and that it would be better to ask the Egyptian Government to issue a public announcement that in future aircraft flying over prohibited areas would be firedat with live ammunition. The draft of a telegram on these lineshad been concurred in by the Air Ministry and had been referredto the Admiralty for their concurrence.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that Admiralty approvalof the telegram had been given that morning.The First Sea Lord said that on two days recently the italians had flown formations of bombers to Italian East Africa; these air-craft had landed at Alexandria en route. He hoped that steps couldbe taken either to stop the landing of such bombers in Egypt or atleast to arrange for them to use some aerodrome not situated nearAlexandria.

(40) 126thConclusions,Minute 7.)signor mussolini&apos;reply to thePrime Minister&apos;message.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that in thelast few days there had been many rumours that large numbers of germans had infiltrated into Spain from Italy, the suggestion being that they intended later to make a move against Portugal. Hehad taken the matter up with the Portuguese Government on several occasions and also with the Spanish Government. He had also mentioned it to the Spanish Ambassador, who had professed to feelno eoncern on the subject. Nevertheless, he (the Foreign Secretary)was not completely reassured.The Duke of Alba had informed him that the feeling in Spainwas becoming more friendly towards us, but less so towards France.He had asked the Foreign Secretary to take up with the French along list of Spanish grievances. The French Government, as wasto be expected, had produced an explanation of every point, and said that all blame rested with Spain. The Foreign secretary thought it was useless to discuss individual grievances, but he proposed to see the Duke of Alba again and to try to bring theFrench and Spanish Governments closer together.The Foreign Secretary added that Sir Samuel Hoare had agreed to head a Special Mission to Spain, and would probablystart the following week. It would be a great advantage to us tohave a representative there who was fully informed of the points which were causing us anxiety.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that steps were beingtaken by the Admiralty to check the accuracy of a recent intelligence report in which it was alleged that increasing use was being madeof Vigo as a German submarine base, and that there were a largenumber of submarines in the port.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto an unnumbered telegram, dated the 17th May, 1940, from theMilitary Attache, Ankara, to the War Office, reporting that theTurkish General Staff had learnt from what they believed was agood source that Italy was mobilising secretly, and that mobilisa-tion would be complete in two days. From a less reliable source, theGeneral Staff had learnt also that German troops, includingarmoured units, had crossed the Brenner Pass.The Foreign Secretary said on the previous day Count Cianohad told Sir Percy Loraine that he had submitted the PrimeMinister&apos;s message to Signor Mussolini, who had read it with close attention; Count Ciano believed that Signor Mussolini would send a reply the following day (the 18th May, 1940).The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that he would look into this question.The War Cabinet :-Took note that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs proposed to telegraph to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Cairo,on the lines indicated in discussion in regard to aircraft which did not obey the prohibited area regulations inEgypt-
10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following reports received in regard to the Italian reaction toour offer to discuss contraband control measures : (a) Sir Percy Loraine had now telegraphed (telegram No. 565)that Count Ciano had stated that morning that signor mussolini&apos;s decision regarding the proposed discussions in Rome was favourable in principle and that SignorPietromarchi was drafting a reply.(b) The previous evening the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs had received a message fromthe Master of the Rolls that we were likely to receive afavourable answer from Signor Mussolini.(c) The previous evening the Foreign Office had been informed by the Marchese Patrizi, of the Italian Embassy, thatour proposals had been favourably received. TheMarchese Patrizi had added that, if later any publicitywere to be given to this matter, we should be careful tomake it clear that&apos; our object in these negotiations was toremove the Italian grievance of being a prisoner in theMediterranean. Strong objection was felt in Rome tothe allegation in the British press that Signor Mussoliniwas sitting on the fence; this was far from representingthe Duce&apos;s motives.The Foreign Secretary said that these reports were difficult to interpret. Signor Mussolini might be seeking to deceive us, or might be apprehensive of the dangers involved in a German victory.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy. 11.   The Minister of Information  said that it was mostFacilities for important at the present time that we should be able to broadcastBritish to Italy.   The Italians jammed broadcasts in Italian from thisbroadcasts.        country; and broadcasts to Italy could now only be made from Cairo.This involved the use of the telephone for a period of about20 minutes every evening. The Service Departments had absolute priority in the use of the telephone facilities, but he hoped that theywould agree to provide a line for this period to the Ministry ofInformation at a regular hour every evening.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the importance ofthis matter, he felt sure that the Service Ministers would be ableto make the necessary arrangements.The War Cabinet:-Approved the proposal submitted by the Minister ofInformation.12.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theFrench Ambassador had informed him that the French Governmenthad received a request from the Belgian Government to be permittedtransfer the seat to establish themselves on French territory. The French Governmentjft   .of Government  na-d expressed the view that the Belgian Government should remain to France.        on Belgian territory as long as possible, but that they had noobjection to the arrival in France of &quot; quelques elements.&quot; A reportin the same sense had been received the previous evening fromSir Ronald Campbell (telegram No. 213 DIPP from Paris).Belgium.Request for permission toContrabandcontrol.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 124thConclusions,Minute 7.)
U.S.S.R.Suggesteddespatch of aspecial envoy tcMoscow.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 13.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 62ndConclusions,Minute 6.)X&quot;13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he felt that the Soviet Government were uneasy at the German advance,and that it might be possible to make some arrangement with them.We should at least find out if this was possible. The position mightbe summarised as follows : When he had handed to M. Maisky our reply on the subjectof trade negotiations the latter had reacted very strongly andhad taken the view that our approach to this problem was entirely mistaken. At that time, he (the Foreign Secretary)had thought that we should take no further action until thereceipt of the Soviet Governments reply. Two days previously(the 16th May), however, M. Maisky had informed Mr. R. A.Butler that he very much doubted whether the Soviet Govern-ment would, in fact, send any reply. M. Maisky had added thatin his view the best way to pursue the negotiations would beby word of mouth rather than by exchange of notes.He (the Foreign Secretary) had had a long conversationwith Sir Stafford Cripps who, it would be recalled, had flownfrom China to Moscow, where he had had long discussions with M. Molotov. Sir Stafford Cripps took the view that wehad been at fault in our handling of the Soviet Governmentand felt convinced that we could reach agreement with them on trade and possibly on political questions. For this purpose,personal discussions were essential. Sir Stafford did not askto be entrusted with this task, but if the Government felt hecould be of service and chose to send him to Moscow to find out what the possibilities were, no harm would be done and theSoviet Government would see that we were in earnest. At the close of the interview Sir Stafford Cripps had confirmed tothe Foreign Secretary that his suggestion was that the foreign secretary should inform M. Maisky that he had been thinkingover his (M. Maisky&apos;s) reaction to our Note, and that, while notadmitting in any way the justice of his reproaches, we proposed,if that were agreeable to the&apos; Soviet Government, to sendSir Stafford Cripps to Moscow by air for the purpose ofexploring the position.After consultation with the Prime Minister, he (theForeign Secretary) had discussed the matter further with theMinister for Economic Warfare the previous afternoon, andhad agreed that it would, be of advantage to invite Sir stafford cripps to undertake this mission, provided it was clearly understood by him that his functions were to ascertain fromthe Soviet Government their attitude on various questions inwhich the Ministry of Economic Warfare and other Depart-ments were interested, and to report as to the possibility ofovercoming the various difficulties which had arisen in regardto these matters.If this proposal commended itself to the War Cabinet, he intended, therefore, to make the necessary arrangements with sir Stafford Cripps, in consultation with the Minister for economic warfare. When the time came to announce that Sir Stafford Crippswas going to Moscow, it might be of advantage, he thought, to statethat it was our intention shortly to send an Ambassador to Moscowonce again. It would be necessary also to consider the probablereactions in France, the United States and Japan. The French werenot likely in the present circumstances to raise objection, while theUnited States and Japan would probably be satisfied by an assurance that our object was to ascertain whether an agreementbetween the two countries was possible, having regard to the war situation.
aircraft production.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 116thConclusions,Minute 1.)14. The Minister for Aircraft Production outlined the steps which he had already taken to increase output. The Nuffield repairshops had been taken over. Up to date only one machine had been completely repaired in these workshops. He hoped to give an outputof 3 aircraft a week from salvaged machines.The aircraft works at Castle Bromwich had been taken over.Finished parts would be transferred to Southampton, the resultbeing that the combined works would deliver 40 Spitfires during thenext month or so, as against none under the existing programme.The provision of extra material which would be provided byAvros should at once increase production of Blenheim aircraft by10 per week.The Minister now asked authority for the following steps : (1) to take over the aircraft storage units from the AirMinistry;(2) to take over the R.A.F. repair depots from the AirMinistry;(3) to withhold delivery from this country of aircraft to canada and raw material to Australia.As regards (1) there were in the aircraft storage units 2,100machines. Of these 1,400 were incomplete. It was hoped that by applying ourselves to the problem we should be able to get a flow of serviceable machines from this source.[21298] cIn the course of subsequent discussion, the following points were raised:  (i) It should be clearly understood, both by the Soviet Govern-rnent and by Sir Stafford Cripps, that the function ofthe latter was to explore the possibility of an agreement and to report to the War Cabinet, but not to attempthimself to reach an agreement.(ii) The despatch of such a Mission would serve to create abetter atmosphere in Moscow. There would be no advantage in existing circumstances in the proposed discussions being carried out with great speed. On thecontrary, it would be of advantage for Sir stafford cripps to make a thorough study of the ground.(iii) It was desirable that at least one experienced advisershould be attached to Sir Stafford Cripps&apos;s suite.(iv) It was important, from the point of view of the Ministryof Economic Warfare, that nothing should be done to prejudice our plans for stricter contraband control ofimports entering the U.S.S.E. at Vladivostok.The Prime Minister said that there was general agreement inthe Cabinet that it would be of advantage to invite Sir stafford cripps to undertake an exploratory mission on the lines suggested.He doubted, however, whether it would be desirable at the sametime to announce our intention of sending an Ambassador to moscow.   This could be left till a later stage.The War Cabinet agreed :  (1) That Sir Stafford Cripps should be invited to proceed to moscow to explore, and to report to the War Cabineton, the possibilities of our reaching agreement with theSoviet Government on outstanding trade and other questions.(2) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should accordingly send for the Soviet Ambassador and makea communication to him on the lines indicated at&quot; X &quot; above.
The Minister hoped that (2) would further stimulate the output,from salvaged aircraft.As to (3), the aircraft destined for Canada were Ansons andBattles. These would be re-equipped and could be used as first-line aircraft. Suitable aircraft for use in the Empire Training scheme in Canada could almost certainly be obtained from the United Statesof America.The Secretary of State for Air said that in discussion on theprevious day he had been in general agreement with the Minister&apos;sproposals, but he had a number of points in regard to the threeproposals outlined by the Minister, which required further con-sideration.In the course of the discussion which ensued, the followingpoints were made : R.A.F. Repair Depots.These were staffed by personnel under the control of theAir Council.Aircraft Storage Units.(i) The same difficulty in regard to personnel arose.(ii) While aircraft were held in storage units, they weremodified in accordance with. the latest operationalexperience and were fitted with items such as self-sealing petrol tanks, and armour plate.(iii) There was a constant flow of aircraft through the storageunits. For example, 100 Hurricanes had recently passedfrom storage into active service.(iv) It was true that the outflow from the storage units to the operational units was now less than the flow of aircraft from the manufacturers to the aircraft storage units.This, however, was mainly due to the shortage of various items of equipment and also to the need for essentialmodification. A great endeavour had been made to accelerate the production of these articles of equipment.While the Air Ministry would welcome the assist-ance of the Minister of Aircraft Production inaccelerating the work carried out in aircraft storageunits, the Air Ministry felt that they must retainresponsibility for the allocation of aircraft passing outof the aircraft storage units.Withholding of delivery of aircraft to Canada.(i) It was explained that importance was attached in canada to maintaining deliveries of aircraft so as to enable theTraining Scheme to function according to schedule.(ii) The importance was emphasised of a proper relation between aircraft production and the training of pilots.At the moment, as regards Fighters we were short of machines, while in regard to Bombers we were short of crews, which required careful training.(iii) The aircraft for delivery to Canada were of a type whichwas regarded as obsolescent and which it was hopedwould pass out of service in the next six months. Wehad good reserves of Battle aircraft.The Battles in question had been rigged for target-towing, and before they could be used in active squadronsthe training equipment would have to be removed andmodern operational components added. It was in regardto components that the shortage was most serious.The Prime Minister said that he thought that it was essentialthat we should concentrate our efforts on ensuring the most effectiveAir force to meet the events of the next few months, even though

The War Cabinet had before them a joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Labour and national Service (W.P. (G.) (40) 129) making certain recommenda-tions for providing the men required for the Auxiliary MilitaryPioneer Corps.The Secretary of State for War said that he and the Ministerof Labour were fully agreed upon the proposals set out in their memorandum and were anxious to secure an early decision upon them. The principal proposal was that the additional men required should be obtained by calling up men under the Armed Forces Actand retaining them in the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps for months before transferring them to combatant units.The War Cabinet Approved the recommendations set out in paragraph 10 of memorandum W.P. (G.) (40) 129.Invasion ofGreat Britain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 126thConclusions,Minute 6.)Measures toprevent landing of aeroplanes onopen spaces.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 119thConclusions,Minute 3.)Proposeddefensive works.16. The Secretary of State for War said that the Militaryand Home Security authorities were carrying out a reconnaissance of open spaces with a view to preventing their use as far as possible by enemy aeroplanes. It was impossible to deal with all possibleopen spaces, but it was proposed to take the necessary action inthe neighbourhood of specially important objectives, such asaerodromes, R.D.F. stations, power stations, &amp;c.He also asked for Cabinet authority for proceeding at once withthe erection of Defensive Works in important situations, e.g., onthe landward sides of defended ports. A list was being drawn upby the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, in conjunction with theMinister of Home Security.   He proposed to circulate for the this might involve some risk to long-term schemes. It was essentialthat every endeavour should be concentrated on ensuring that ourlarge reserves of aircraft were put into a condition in which theycould all be used for active operations as quickly as possible. Itwas clear that the most essential step was to accelerate the pro-duction of the items of equipment in which there were shortages.The points raised in regard to control of aircraft storage units and of R.A.F. repair depots should be further discussed betweenthe two Departments and points of difficulty resolved.In regard to the proposal to withhold delivery of trainingaircraft to Canada, he thought that it would be unwise to take animmediate decision, and that this matter also should be further discussed. He therefore suggested that the two Ministers should meet together that afternoon in order to discuss the questions a tissue, under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal, who would act as arbiter in the event of disagreement.The War Cabinet approved the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal.
information of the War Cabinet a list of priorities showingthe positions which it was considered most important to defend andthe methods which it was proposed to adopt. These would consistpartly of excavations by mechanical diggers, and partly of theerection of obstacles, and would, of course, involve drastic inter-ference with private property.The War Cabinet agreed That the Secretary of State for War should have authorityto proceed with defensive works on the lines set out above.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 18, 1940.
