The western front.Withdrawal ofthe B.E.F.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 144thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Prime Minister said that the latest information fromthe Admiralty was that 40,000 troops from the B.E.F. had so far been landed in this country, and that evacuation was now takingplace at the rate of about 2,000 an hour.The Chief of Naval Staff said that of the 27 destroyersoperating off the beaches at Dunkirk, H.M.S. Wakeful with 630troops on board had been sunk off Nieuport early that day, probably by a submarine, but possibly by a motor torpedo boat. H.M.S.Graf ton, with no troops on board, had gone to her assistance andhad also been torpedoed and sunk. There were many small craftin the vicinity picking up survivors.A number of merchant seamen at Dover had refused to mansome of the smaller craft engaged in the operations off Dunkirk,and over 200 stokers and seamen from Chatham had taken their place. .............In answer to a question, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff said that it was difficult to give any regular priority as regardsembarkation. So far, those taken off consisted mostly of royal army Service Corps and Lines of Communication troops, togetherwith a number of gunners. That day and the following day, how-ever, it was hoped to embark fighting formations. A battalion of welsh Guards (which formed part of the General Headquarterstroops) had also been got away. Troops from General Blanchard&apos;s army had also reached the coast. Lord Gort had been informedthat it was important to get the French, as well as our own troops,away. It would not be possible to evacuate any armed vehicles ortanks.Communications        The Secretary of State for War read a telegram that had beenwith Lord Gort. received from Lord Gort at 6 o&apos;clock the previous evening.   he also read the reply that had been sent to this telegram and a reportthat had been received on the condition of troops as they disembarkedin this country.A record of the discussion that ensued is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Troops south of The Secretary of State for War said that the first prioritythe Somme. was being given to the withdrawal to this country of some 20,000trained reinforcements now on our Lines of Communication southof the Somme. Steps were also being taken to withdraw some50,000 men who were now on the Lines of Communication. stores and equipment were also being brought back to this country, butsufficient was being left in France for five Divisions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Western 2.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs informed tneFront. War Cabinet that Dominion Governments had so far not beenInformation for informed that the British Expeditionary Force was being withdrawnDominion from Northern France and Belgium, although he had sent a &quot; mostGovernments. secret and personal &apos;&apos; message to Dominion Premiers on the evening(Previous of the 26th May informing them that evacuation was probablyReference: inevitable. He asked whether the daily telegraphic summary of w.M. (40) 141st information to Dominion Governments could now include detailsConclusions,      of the progress of the evacuation.Minute l.) He also sought the approval of the War Cabinet to the despatchof an answer to a questionnaire which had been received fromMr. Menzies about a week ago. A further telegram had beenreceived from Mr. Menzies (No. 242), from which it appeared that he assumed that the French were in danger of early collapse.A reply had already been sent to him that this assumption wasaltogether unfounded, but it would be desirable to answer the full[21356] b 2
questionnaire as soon as possible in order not to give the impres-sion that we were withholding information from Dominion Govern-ments.   The answer had already been drafted by the Service Staffs.The War Cabinet--(i) Authorised the communication to Dominion Governmentsof details of the withdrawal of the British ExpeditionaryForce, including the total numbers which had beenembarked up to date,(ii) Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to despatch the reply to Mr. Menzies&apos; questionnaire, subjectto the agreement of the Secretary of State for Warregarding the disclosure of any especially secret information.The western front.ReportedGerman order as to the treat-ment of Frenchprisoners.3. Attention was called to the report in that day&apos;s papersthat, on Field-Marshal Goring&apos;s orders, all prisoners of war of theFrench Air Force were to be shackled immediately on capture and kept in separate camps. Every time the murder of a Germanairman was reported, five French airmen would be shot. When-ever cases were reported of German airmen being fired at whilejumping for their lives with parachutes, fifty French prisonerswould be shot. These measures, it was stated, would not applyto captured British airmen.The Chief of the Air Staff said that he had seen nothing onthis subject apart from the reports in the newspapers. He under-took to make enquiries.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.The air situation.Air fighting on28th May.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 144thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Chief of the Air Staff said that 41 German aircraft,confirmed, had been destroyed the previous day and possibly another8, unconfirmed; we had lost 24. This figure included 19 enemy aircraft shot down over Northern Norway and not previously reported.During the day fighter patrols had been carried out in strengthover the Dunkirk beaches and escorts for bombers had been providedfor the St. Omer and Aire areas. Blenheim aircraft had attackedcolumns of tanks and lorries in the St. Omer area and West ofAire, and road and railway communications East of Menin andYpres. A fighter patrol over Dunkirk had forced a large waveof enemy bombers to turn back.During the night the 28th-29th May, heavy bombers had attacked enemy lines of communication at Givet, Guise, Hirson andNamur, and oil tanks and hangars in the St. Omer area. several of these objectives had been successfully attacked, although visibilityhad been difficult.The Prime Minister said that the Air Force had changed itsmethod of giving protection to the evacuation operations and,instead of continuous patrols over the area, the Air Force was nowproviding occasional patrols of much greater strength. The WarCabinet had asked for the maximum air protection to be given, andhe thought that the Air Staff must be left to provide this in whatevermanner they thought best.

The Chief of Naval Staff reported that a British ship(6,878 tons) bound from Bristol to Jamaica had been mined in the bristol Channel; she had been in the centre of the swept channel.The ship had been &quot; de-gaussed,&quot; but it was not certain that the mine was magnetic.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.6. The Prime Minister said that Narvik had been occupiedby French and Norwegian troops at 10 p.m. the previous evening.Further discussion as to the position in Norway is recorded inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The Chief of the Air Staff said that Skaanland aerodrome in norway had proved unsuitable for the operation of the Hurricanes,which had therefore been transferred to Bardu Foss. FifteenHurricanes remained serviceable out of the 18 sent.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Invasion ofGreat Britain.Likelihood of aGermanexpedition from norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 144thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staffthought that an air-borne expedition based on Norway was onlylikely as part of a full-scale German invasion of the British Isles.A sea-borne expedition from Norway alone was still more improb-able, particularly during the summer months. Arrangements were,however, being made for reconnaissances to be maintained to guard against the possibility of a German expedition being directed from norway against this country.In discussion, several members of the War Cabinet emphasised the importance of building up effective sources of intelligence in norway and Denmark within the shortest possible time.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Invasion ofGreat Britain.Troops availablein Great Britain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 126thConclusions,Minute 6.)The middle east.Troops inPalestine.8. The Secretary of State for War described the steps whichwere being taken to increase the fighting strength of the troops inthis country. A full statement describing the measures taken andin progress would be circulated to the War Cabinet shortly.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.9. In connection with the preceding item, some discussion tookplace on the suggestion that 8 Regular battalions should be with-drawn from Palestine to this country.The Prime Minister said that, in his view, the vital need atthe present time was to protect this country, and that this must take precedence over all other needs.The War Cabinet were informed that the High commissioner of Palestine had expressed the view that if these 8 battalions wereto be withdrawn, he should be given an assurance that either theAustralian troops would be retained in Palestine, or that, if theywere removed, they would be replaced by an equivalent force.[21356]b 3
Italy. 10.   The Foreign Secretary drew attention to Rome telegramProbable No. 714 DIPP, dated the 28th May, reporting a conversationintentions. between Sir Percy Loraine and Count Ciano. The latter had made(Previous it clear that Italy&apos;s entry into the war was now a certainty; thereReference:        remained only doubt about the date.   It might be within a week,W.M. (40) 135th it might be later, but the delay could no longer be reckoned in conclusions,      months.   His promise of fair warning stood.   It was the eve of minute 5.)        great decisions; but the)r had yet to be taken.  Later in the conversa-tion Count Ciano had said that he had told the French ambassador that, even if France came forward with an offer to cede Tunis,Algeria and Morocco, Signor Mussolini would decline to discuss it.Count Ciano had claimed that he had never misled the Ambassadorabout Italy&apos;s position.   Sir Percy Loraine had replied that if Italymade war, war would be met with war.   The responsibility wouldbe Signor MussolinFs and his alone.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.11. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute, the War Cabinet considered what measures should be taken against Italians in this country. The following were the main points dealt with  (i) A number of  Italians occupied positions  in  &apos;&apos; key&apos;&apos;factories, particularly electrical power stations in theEastern Counties, some of which were under Italianmanagement.It was agreed that Italians occupying positions inkey factories should be stood off immediately.(ii) There were 18,000 Italians in this country, many of whom had lived here for many years. If Italy entered the war against us, Italians in large numbers would have to be interned; but at the moment there could be no questionof wholesale internment of Italians.(iii) Among the Italians in this country was a proportion ofdesperate characters who would not hesitate to commitacts of sabotage. These men had been listed, and action could be taken against them at short notice. Theynumbered about 1,000.(iv) The Home Secretary was anxious that, when it was decidedthat action should be taken, all the persons on this list should be dealt with at the same time, and at very short notice. If orders were given late at night, action couldbe taken in the early hours of the following morning.(v) The real question for decision was whether, if orders wereto be given to seize these men, say, on the following morning, this would play into Signor Mussolini&apos;s hands and give him ground for alleging that we had been thefirst to begin hostile action.(vi) One way of avoiding this would be to seize at the sametime a number of British Fascists. It was felt, however,that the anti-Italian character of the action proposedcould not be concealed,(vii) It was accordingly suggested that Sir Percy Lorainemight be authorised to approach Count Ciano on thefollowing lines : that we were grateful to him for hisindication of Italy&apos;s probable action; that we did not wish to intern large numbers of Italians in this country,and that we were therefore ready to send back to ItalyItalians now in England, provided that Italy would actreciprocally. In the meantime the potentially dangerousItalians might be seized and held.Italy.Action againstItalians in the united kingdom.

(40) 145thConclusions,Minute 1.)SuggestedAllied appeal toU.S.A.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 145thConclusions,Minute 2.)12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Paris telegram No. 294 DIPP, dated the 28th May, reporting a conversation between His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and M. Mandel.The latter had said that he was satisfied with the spirit of theFrench Government  IS 9j whole.The Foreign Secretary said that he had had a furtherconversation with the French Ambassador, to whom he had shownSir Percy Loraine&apos;s account of his latest conversation with count ciano (see Minute 10). He had, he hoped, convinced M. Corbinthat nothing was to be gained by a direct approach to signor mussolini.The main subject of the conversation had been M. Reynaud&apos;suggestion that France and Great Britain should make an appealto the U.S.A. for help. He had informed M. Corbin of the enquiries which we were making (telegram No. 938 to Washington).M. Corbin had said that Mr. Bullitt had appeared to be attracted by the suggestion that President Roosevelt might send the UnitedStates Atlantic Fleet to the Mediterranean. The Foreign secretary had done his best to demonstrate that this proposal was fantastic.The first thing was to see whether President Roosevelt was disposed to make any response to an appeal from this side.(viii) It was then pointed out that, if we acted on these lines and war followed, the French Government might saythat we had precipitated war with Italy. We should therefore consult the French before putting thesuggestion to Count Ciano or seizing the dangerouscharacters. A day&apos;s delay was probably not material,since Italy was not likely to come into the war on the morrow.The War Cabinet accordingly agreed : :(1) That the Home Secretary should arrange that Italiansemployed as key men in industry and in electrical power stations should be stood off at once, in accordance withthe arrangements already made.(2) That the Foreign Secretary, after consultation with theMinister for Home Security, should communicate to theFrench Government the suggestion that we should offer to Count Ciano to deport all Italians in this country, in exhange for British subjects in Italy.(3) That, provided the French Government saw no objection,the Foreign Secretary should be authorised to instruct sir Percy Loraine to put this suggestion to the ItalianGovernment.(4) That action should be deferred for the present in regard tothe internment of Italians regarded as dangerouscharacters, and British subjects known to have connec-tions with Italian institutions in this country.
13. The Foreign Secretary said that it was now clear that theSoviet Government wanted a British Ambassador reappointed at moscow. They would be suspicious if no appointment were madeas soon as Sir Stafford Cripps arrived. He had asked the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State to see M. Maisky and to ask ifit would meet his Government&apos;s wishes if, as an interim measure,Sir Stafford Cripps were described as an Ambassador on specialmission.The Foreign Secretary also mentioned Moscow telegramNo. 241a reporting that the Charge d&apos;Affaires said that he hadlearnt from a reliable source that the German Naval Attache had recently expressed the fervent hope that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould in no circumstances transfer themselves to Canada. Such a move, he had said, would lead inevitably to the defeat of Germany.Probably this represented some tortuous piece of German propa-ganda, if so, it would crop up elsewhere.The War Cabinet-Approved the action taken by the Foreign Secretary withregard to the suggested appointment of an ambassador on special mission to Moscow.U.S.A.Construction of aerodromes and naval bases inBritish colonies and Dominions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 141stConclusions,Minute 7.)14. The War Cabinet had before them an Aide-memoire by theChiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 174).The First Lord of the Admiralty demurred to the proposal ofLord Lothian to offer the lease of aerodromes and bases in british territory to the United States of America, more particularly as theproposal for the sale of American destroyers to this country hadbeen rejected by the Americans.The Secretary of State for the Colonies also opposed theproposal. Leases on a large scale in the oilfields of Trinidad, ifonce given to the Americans would amount to a virtual cession of sovereignty. Much American plant and capital would be put intothe island, and the Americans would obtain a controlling interest.The effect of granting the bases proposed would be very bad indeedon the small Colonies throughout the Empire, which were makinggreat contributions towards our war effort. Moreover, in his opinion the only result would be to strengthen the isolationist feeling inAmerica; only fear and respect would bring in the United states on our side. The proposal had not come from the Americans them-selves, and the Republican Party would suspect it as an endeavour toentrap them into intervention.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that the aerodrome in Newfoundland, on which facilities might be given tothe United States, had only just been completed after three years&apos;work, at a cost of some  f million. Negotiations were in progress for the Canadian Government to assume responsibility for it. TheUnited Kingdom Government was at present in the position of atrustee for the people of Newfoundland, and if we handed over the aerodrome to the Americans, our action would be bitterly resentedthere, quite apart from the resentment which would be felt inCanada. We should at least take steps to ascertain the wishes ofthe people of Newfoundland before we did anything in the matter.The Prime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal thought that nofurther steps should be taken in regard to Lord Lothian&apos;s proposalat all.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that we might point out to Lord Lothian the serious political difficultieswhich would have to be overcome, and inform him that the idea(previous reference:W.M.

Home Defence.Conduct of operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 144thConclusions,Minute 8.)15. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff (W.P. (40) 177) submitting proposals for the control of operations and forces in the event of an attempted invasion of thiscountry.The Lord President of the Council expressed full concurrencewith the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff, which were thecomplement to the proposals which he had .put forward for the strengthening of the Home Defence Executive in W.P. (40) 173.The Chiefs of Staff proposals covered the arrangements for active operations, whereas his own only dealt with present conditions. Heenquired whether it was the intention that the Commander-in-Chief should establish himself in the Central War Room now, or should remain at Kneller Hall until active operations began.The Chief of the Air Staff said that it was not intended thatthe Commander-in-Chief should move from Kneller Hall to hisadvanced headquarters until active operations began. The advancedheadquarters should, however, at once be put into full commissionand the additional staff, proposed in the Report, appointed. Untilactive operations began the Home Defence Executive would continueto function as at present.The Minister of Home Security suggested that this should bemade clear in paragraph 7 of the Report, which as at present draftedwas somewhat ambiguous.The Prime Minister observed that there was no reason why theCommander-in-Chief should not have direct access to him beforeoperations began. This would be a matter of convenience, but neednot be formally recorded in the Report.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that theCommander-in-Chief had not yet had an opportunity of seeing theReport, and suggested that its acceptance should be made subjectto his concurrence.could only be considered if, after private consultation with thePresident, he could produce convincing reasons for expectingconcrete results from the proposal.In the discussion which ensued it was urged that : (i) Once the matter had been broached with the President,our hands would be tied if he reacted favourably. we might find it difficult later on to back out if the political objections from our point of view seemed insuperable.(ii) The isolationist party in America would make capital outof any offer which came from our side.(iii) A definite assurance of American assistance should be aprerequisite of any concessions on our part.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toinform Lord Lothian of the sense of the discussion whichhad taken place and of the serious political objections tohis proposal; and to ask him to say what reasons he had for thinking that, if these objections could be overcome,really substantial advantages would accrue to us from theproposed offer to the United States. In the meantime theproposal should not be broached with the President.
The War Cabinet :-Approved the Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40)177), subject to the deletion of the words &quot; not only &quot; in line 1 and &quot;but beforehand&quot; in line 2 of paragraph 7,and to the concurrence of the Commander-in-Chief, home forces, to the proposals contained therein.Excess Profits 16.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the tax. Chancellor of the Exchequer regarding the application of the100 per cent, rate of the Excess Profits Tax (W.P. (40) 176).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had consulted the President of the Board of Trade on the proposal set out in his memorandum. Sir Andrew Duncan had agreed, but had enquire whether undertakings engaged in the export trade could continueto pay 60 per cent.General agreement was expressed with the view that thissuggestion could not be entertained.The Minister of Supply supported the proposal of theChancellor of the Exchequer.The War Cabinet: Approved the proposal of the Chancellor of the exchequer to announce in the House of Commons that afternoon thatthe Government proposed that, with retrospective effect from the 1st April, 1940, the Excess Profits Tax should beraised to 100 per cent, in its application to all undertakings and not merely in its application to &quot; controlled under -takings.&quot;Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 29, 1940.
