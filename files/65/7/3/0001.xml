The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 110thConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy activity.RA.F. activity.stavanger aerodrome.Rye andFornebuaerodromes.Reports of enemy warships and shipping.Mine-laying operations.coastal command.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that during daylighton the previous day three unidentified aircraft had been tracked,two off Ostend and one off Felixstowe. During the very early hours:of that day twelve aircraft had been detected off the Dutch coast,,thence across the Belgian-French frontier to a point near Arras,whence they had returned on the same track. A.A. guns had beenin action in northern France but fighter action had been prevented by weather conditions. At 4-30 a.m. a track had been plotted east of Felixstowe, following the coast to Dungeness and Beachy Head.Reports had been received that H.M.S. Watchful, convoy escort,had been attacked.The R.A.F. had had a good day. No less than sixty-one aircraft had been operating and some effective results had been obtained.No aircraft had been brought down by the enemy. One had crashedon landing, but the crew had been unhurt.Six Blenheims had attacked the aerodrome at Stavanger duringthe day in clear weather conditions and many bomb bursts had been seen on the target. Our aircraft had not been engaged by enemy fighters.  All had returned.A further successful attack had been made on Stavanger duringthe night by five Whitleys.Information had been received which showed that these raids had been very effective.A heavy and successful attack had been launched on Ryeaerodrome during the night by six Blenheims and elevenWellingtons. Fires had been started on the aerodrome and in the surrounding woods. A heavy explosion had been observed as our aircraft were leaving the target.Six Wellingtons had attacked Fornebu aerodrome successfully.Twenty-six Hampdens had taken off for a &quot; G &quot; reconnaissancethe previous night. Fifteen had been successful in locating the target.Security patrols over enemy seaplane bases had been maintained during the night by four Wellingtons. No activity had been seen and no enemy mine-laying aircraft had been reported off our coasts.The following sightings of ships had been made by these air-craft : (i) Three brilliantly lighted ships of about 6,000 tons each,anchored in the West End Bay of Norderney, close to the shore.(ii) A large convoy of fifty ships steaming North in the Syltarea at 22 hours.   No speed had been given.(iii) Nine ships steaming towards Terschelling, showing singlemasted lights, but appearing larger than trawlers.Coastal Command had organised reconnaissances to search forand report on the large convoy observed off Sylt.Our mine-laying aircraft had now laid nearly 150 mines inGerman waters. A report that the mouth of the Ems had been closed pointed to our operations having met with some success.One Hudson had sighted a large merchant vessel, with twocoastal vessels near by, about 10 miles North of Borkum at 8 a.m.The coastal vessels had opened fire and the aircraft had bombed themerchant vessel, but the result of the attack was unknown.Apart from anti-submarine patrols, the main effort of coastal command had been devoted to providing escort against air attackfor the force evacuated from Aandalsnes. This escort had beenprovided by Blenheims and Hudsons, and had lasted throughout thehours of daylight. As far as was known, no enemy aircraft hadbeen encountered.The Secretary of State said that his intention was to send feweraircraft on reconnaissance duties over Norway for the next, say,ten days, in order to conserve our forces, and to give a rest to the crews who had been continuously engaged in operations.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 110thConclusions,Minute 2.)Britishsubmarineactivity.H.M.SubmarineUnity.2. The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that H.M. submarineNarwhal had expended 4 torpedoes on a convoy in the Kattegat on1st May. One possible hit had been scored. She had completedher mining operation, and was now clear of the Kattegat, andreturning to base.Off Bergen, H.M. submarine Trident had made an attack withtorpedo and gunfire the previous day on a northbound enemy supplyship, the Languenuen. The supply ship had been driven ashore,a total loss. Subsequent attacks by depth charges had left Tridentundamaged.At midnight three Norwegian ships loaded with pulp had beenawaiting escort 50 miles off the Norwegian coast. Their destinationwas Kirkwall.It was intended to discontinue attempts to save the four menin H.M. submarine Unity.Four magnetic mines had been exploded in the Humber area,and one in Tees Bay.Sunderland and the Tyne were now open, subject to localroutine instructions. The Humber, Blyth, Dunkirk and Calaiswere closed.A report had been received from Lord Cork that a Germanescape apparatus, number U64. had been recovered in Bogen on30th April.The First L,ord gave the War Cabinet certain confidential information regarding experiments with new fuzes.Movement of The First Lord said that enquiry had been made into theGerman various reports of German shipping movements on a westerly courseshipping on the 1st May, to which reference had been made at the last meetingtowards Holland of the War Cabinet. It appeared that aircraft had sighted theseon 1st May.      vessels at a distance of some 10 miles and a height of 19,000 feet.The Naval Staff therefore felt that their examination had beeninsufficient for positive identification. An aircraft which had been dispatched in the afternoon to confirm the results of this earlierreconnaissance had made a negative report. Nevertheless, a signalhad been sent to our Naval Attache at The Hague warning him ofthese movements. The Dutch Government had been much alarmedby this information, but they had no other reasons for the specialprecautions taken.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Operations In 3.   The War Cabinet were given the following information : Norway. ^ Lord   Cork   reported   that   large-scale   administrative(Previous planning would be necessary before either the harbourEef erence: or the town of Narvik could be of any value to us.  ThereW.M. (40) 110th were about 18 wrecks in the harbour.   Harstad couldConclusions, handle three ships at a time up to 8,000 tons, but wasMmute 3.) still vulnerable from submarine attacks.  There was safeNarvik area. anchorage at Skaanland, and small ships could be handled at Ballangen. Accommodation ashore at both these places was very limited.(2) German attacks on the South Wales Borderers in theAnkenes Peninsula on the 1st May and on the 2nd Mayhad both been repulsed with considerable loss to theenemy. Our own casualties had been very few. german naval guns were reported retiring on the evening of the1st May in Labergdalel and Grattangoeidet. Theoperations which were taking place consisted of closingin on the enemy and driving in his outlying detachmentsas a preliminary to the capture of the town.
4  It)[21247](3) The chief danger which we should have to face at Narvikduring the next few days was that of air attack by aircraft which would use Trondhjem as an advancedbase. Now that the Trondhjem area had been evacuated,the Germans were likely to concentrate all their efforts on Narvik. There were 12 anti-aircraft guns at Narviknow and 36 more were due to arrive on the 6th May.(4) It was very difficult for oar aircraft to find Trondhjemaerodrome at night. The aerodrome was almost at thelimit of their range, and they had no time to search for it. To give indirect protection to Narvik, the R.A.F.would keep up the attack on the German aerodromesrbut experience showed that aerodromes were not a veryprofitable target. The aircraft might be damaged, butthe aerodromes themselves stood up well to bombing.The Germans would probably soon devise methods togive additional protection to their aircraft, either bydispersal or concealment.(5) It was hoped to install fighter aircraft in the Narvik .area by the 12th May, but in the meantime protection wouldbe afforded by aircraft from carriers.Mosjoen. (6) HATS. Janus had refuelled at Skjelfjord on the previous day and had returned to Mosjoen, where she had landedher troops, approximately 128 men, without opposition and apparently unobserved, about midnight.Evacuation of (7) Commander-in-Chief,   Home   Fleet,   had   reported   namsos. 4 o&apos;clock that morning that all ships of the Namsosconvoy were clear of the land and that 6,400 troops hadbeen embarked. General Carton de Wiart was inH.M.S. York. H.M.S. Carlisle had 130 survivors from.M.S. Bittern. The evacuation of Namsos withoutany hitch must be considered as a very successfulmilitary operation.Air attack on (8) The convoy, which was now well out at sea, had beenNamsos convoy. followed by some 40 German aircraft, which were carrying out bombing attacks on them. The convoy wassteering to the west of north, in order to throw off theenemy. It was impossible to give air protection fromthis country, since the scene of operations was out of the range of our fighters. Accordingly, the convoy wouldhave to rely on its anti-aircraft guns and pom-poms.The naval vessels in the convoy consisted of 4 cruisers,including the two mentioned above, 8 British destroyers and 1 French destroyer. There were 3 transports, butthe naval vessels also were probably carrying troops. Sofar as was known, the only hit which the enemy aircraft had so far secured was on the French destroyer.(9) The Germans would shortly broadcast their account of theevacuation of Namsos. It might be well to make our ownannouncement a little later, particularly in view of thepossibility of our suffering losses as a result of the air attack on the convoy.Andalsnes. Ships carrying the troops evacuated from Andalsnes had arrived at Scapa. 2,145 men, including wounded, had beenembarked. H.M.S. Manchester had 8 German prisoners among those on board. H.M.S. Auckland had Brigadiers Hogg andHopwood with the rearguard.The War Cabinet took note of this information.
Sweden.Attitude of theSwedishGovernment.(previous references:W.M. (40) 102ndConclusions,Minute 5,and 109thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 440 DIPP, dated the 1st May, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Stockholm, discussing the measures taken bySweden to maintain her neutrality, and the possibility of herdeparting from that attitude in certain circumstances. AdmiralEvans, who had seen this telegram, entirely agreed withMr. Mallefs appreciation.The Prime Minister said that the picture drawn in this telegram was not encouraging. Further, it had been written beforethe latest developments in Norway had become known. The Swedishreaction to those events had been bad.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference erence:   -W.M. (40) 110thConclusions,Minute 4.)Visit of british air Attache to italian airstations.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams on the probable intentions of the ItalianGovernment: Telegram No. 77 (Saving), dated 25th April, 1940, fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Cairo, reporting a conversation which he had had with the Duke of Aosta, when the latter waspassing through Cairo on his way back to his post. The Dukehad said more than once that Italy did not intend, if she could help it, to get involved in the war, though, in making this state-ment, he had added the qualifying phrase &quot; at present.&quot;Telegram No. 226 (R), dated 2nd May, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Athens. Sir Michael Palairet reportedthat the Greek Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs had informed him that morning that the Greek Government hadno disquieting news either from Italy or from Yugoslavia.Telegram No. 443, dated 1st May, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Rome. Count Ciano (who had enquiredthe reason for our official statement announcing certain pre-cautionary measures in the Mediterranean) had stated that theItalian Government had no warlike intentions, and that therewas not likely to be a change in policy for some time to come.He had refused, however, to specify any given time.Telegram No. 448, dated 2nd May, from His Majesty&apos;minister, Rome. The Greek wife of the German Counsellor,talking in Greek to her compatriots, had said that the italians were capable of aggression against a weak country like greece and might try to seize Corfu, but they would not allow them-selves to be embroiled in war.The Foreign Secretary gave particulars of a report receivedfrom the Military Attache- in Rome, from what was considered tobe a reliable source, containing an account of what had transpiredat the Brenner meeting between Signor Mussolini and Herr Hitler.The Prime Minister drew attention to Rome telegram No. 446,dated 1st May, reporting visits which the British Air Attache hadpaid to two Italian air stations. The Air Attache had been received with the greatest friendliness, and had been given every facility.The visit had confirmed the impression that the Italian Air force had so far made no special preparations for war. The Italianofficers had said that they hoped not to take part in the present war.They had hinted, however, that the British were doing their best,by means of unreasonable and irritating control measures in theMediterranean and Adriatic, to assist German pressure and propaganda in Italy.
State of German One Italian Officer, recently returned from Germany, had saidAir Force after that the German Air Force had suffered very considerable casualtiesrecent as the result of action in the air and on the ground by the R.A.F.,operations.        of action by ship anti-aircraft guns, and of flying accidents.   TheGerman airmen were feeling the strain of operations in Norway.The War Cabinet took note of the above information,which was regarded as generally reassuring.Italy.Naval dis-positions in theMediterranean.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 110thConclusions,Minute 5.)Suggesteddiversion of australian andNew Zealandtroop convoys incertaintsircumstanees.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 110thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. In the course of the discussion recorded in Minute 5 above,the First Lord of the Admiralty observed that we had as yet hadno reaction from the Italian Government as a result of our naval dispositions in the Mediterranean, which must, however, be knownto them. It would in his view be wise at this stage to notify these movements to the Italian Government. We should also make asmuch political capital as possible in Turkey out of the arrival ofthis Fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that thisshould be done.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had now received from the Chiefs of Staff their appreciation (in theform of a draft telegram) as to the possible diversion of theAustralian and New Zealand troop convoys. Their general view was that we should adhere to the present decision, but that if thesituation, which was being watched by the Admiralty&apos; from day today, were to deteriorate, these convoys should be diverted to theUnited Kingdom. The latest date on which a decision could betaken was about 9th May, 1940. The Australian Government were anxious that if a convoy had to be detained, it should be detainedat Colombo, rather than at Aden owing to the heat at this time of year.The First Sea Lord said that he wished to make it clear thatthe appreciation submitted by the Chiefs of Staff was intended tocover not only the slow convoy, but also the fast one.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to make an appropriate notification to the Italian authoritiesregarding the recent fleet movements in the Mediter-ranean.(b) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to sendan appropriate communication to the Turkish Govern-ment regarding the arrival of the Allied fleet in theEastern Mediterranean.(c) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs should communicate to the Australian and New zealand governments the appreciation prepared by the Chiefsof Staff on the subject of the possible diversion of theAustralian and New Zealand troop convoys, subject toany minor changes which might be agreed to by theDominions Office in consultation with the Foreign Office.TheNetherlands.Action in theevent of german aggression.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 110thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. With reference to a suggestion made by the Prime Ministerat the previous meeting of the War Cabinet, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 124 DIPP,which he had sent the previous afternoon to His Majesty&apos;s Minister,The Hague, urging the Netherland Government to take certainaction to deny aerodromes in their country to the Germans in theevent of a German invasion.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
The Dominions. 8. The Prime Minister said that the previous day he and the appreciation for Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs had had a meeting with theDominion High Dominion High Commissioners, at which he had been asked toCommissioners, furnish an appreciation on the future outlook. This he had undertaken to do.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.aircraft production.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 104thConclusions,Minute 5.)9. The Secretary of State for Air said that, in conjunctionwith Sir Charles Craven and his other advisers, he was engaged ina thorough study of our aircraft production policy. When thatstudy had been completed in about a week&apos;s time he wouldprobably have, proposals to lay before the War Cabinet. At themoment, however, discussion on this subject would be premature.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Seizure of enemy Exports.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 94thConclusions,Minute 11.)The operation ofthe control.10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Economic Warfare summarising the operations of theEnemy Exports Control since its institution (W.P. (G.) (40) 112).The Minister of Economic Warfare said that this Memorandumraised no questions for decision, but was submitted to the War&apos;Cabinet for their information. The Press statement which we had had to issue as a result of recent discussions in Washington didnot, in fact, involve any substantial concessions. It was, however,sure to lead to a large crop of claims for exemption of specialconsignments, most of which would be unjustified. He anticipatedthe biggest difficulty with Japan in regard to the consignmentsmentioned on pages 5 and 6 of his Memorandum.On this point, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat his information was that the cargoes of 8 ships mentioned inthe Paper represented the same goods as were described as having an approximate value of some  13,250,000, and not, as the wordingmight suggest, the possibility of even larger consignments. In anycase, there seemed reason to hope that we should be able to make abargain with the Japanese Government by exempting a considerablysmaller quantity of goods. The Japanese Commercial Counsellorhad called at the Foreign Office on the previous day and had askedwhether, in asking for the exemption of the eight cargoes from our control, he was asking for too much. He had, of course, been told that he was.The War Cabinet took note of this Memorandum by theMinister of Economic Warfare.Seizure of 11.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theEnemy Exports. Minister of Economic Warfare in regard to the extension of theApplication of    reprisals policy to any new enemy (W.P. (G.) (40) 119).the reprisals ^Ae Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that thispolicy to a new paper ha(j been prepared to provide for the possibility of Italyenemy. becoming an enemy.The Attorney-General said that it was contemplated that thenew Order-in-Council that would be required if Italy entered thewar should recite the continuance and, indeed, aggravation of theillegalities which were the basis of our policy of reprisals. It would point out that these constituted the settled war policy of Germany,with which Italy had associated herself by joining in the war on germany&apos;s side.
There was general agreement that the policy of reprisals oughtto be applied to any enemy power.The War Cabinet-(i) Agreed that, if Italy or any other power were to becomeengaged in war against us while we were at war withGermany, the reprisals policy should apply to such newenemy power in the same way as to Germany.(ii) Invited the Minister of Economic Warfare, in consultationwith the Foreign Office, to prepare a Draft Order-in-Council accordingly, to be submitted to His Majesty inCouncil should the occasion arise.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 3, 1940.
