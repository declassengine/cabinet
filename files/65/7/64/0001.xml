WAR CABINET 169 (40).SuggestedDeclaration of anglo-FrenchUnity.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 168thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Prime Minister recalled that at the conclusion of themeeting held the previous day, there had been some discussion on a proposal for the issue of some further declaration of close reunion between the countries of France and Great Britain. He had that day seen General de Gaulle who had impressed on him thatsome very dramatic move was essential to give M. Reynaud thesupport which he needed to keep his Government in the war, andhe had suggested that a proclamation of the indissoluble unionof the French and British peoples would serve the purpose. Bothhe and M. Corbin had been concerned at the decision reached bythe War Cabinet that morning and embodied in telegramNo. 368 DIPP to France. He (the Prime Minister) had then heard that a new declaration had been drafted for consideration, andGeneral de Gaulle had telephoned to M. Reynaud. As a result ithad seemed advisable to suspend action for the moment. Accordinglya second telegram had been sent to Sir Ronald Campbell instructing him to suspend action on telegram No. 368 DIPP.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that after the morning meeting of the War Cabinet he had seen Sir robert vansittart, whom he had previously asked to draft some dramaticannouncement which might strengthen M. Reynaud&apos;s hand.Sir Robert Vansittart had been in consultation with General de gaulle, M. Monnet, M. Pleven and Mr. Morton. Between themthey had drafted a proclamation. General de Gaulle had impressed upon him the need for publishing the document as quickly aspossible, and wished to take the draft back with him to Francethat night. He had also suggested that the Prime Minister should meet M. Reynaud next day.The draft proclamation which had been prepared was then read to the War Cabinet (copy attached as Annex I). It was recognisedthat such a proclamation raised some very big questions with whichit was difficult to deal at such short notice. The various clauses of the draft proclamation were then discussed seriatim, asfollows : (i) Common Citizenship.This proposal was felt to be acceptable.(ii) Restoration of War Damage.Both nations would be faced with similar problems after theGermans had turned their whole offensive power on to this country,and there would therefore appear to be no objection to commonresponsibility and pooling of resources.(iii) Customs and Currency.The abolition of customs would raise extremely difficult problems. Not only would the Ottawa Agreements and othercommercial treaties have to be taken into account, but also it mustbe remembered that tariffs were a fundamental part of the economy of several Dominions. A fusion of the two currencies would notbe a practical proposition, and the same result would be achieved by a stabilisation of the rate of exchange. It was agreed that itwould be better to delete any specific reference to these matters inthe proclamation.(iv) System of Government.Although the proclamation might declare that there should bea single War Cabinet during the war, it would in fact be necessaryto maintain the two existing Cabinets with a &quot;&quot;super Cabinet&quot;
in addition. The result would be something very similar to ourpresent arrangements, but the use of the phrase &quot; War Cabinet &quot;instead of &quot; Supreme War Council&quot; would emphasise the closenessof the union. It would not be practicable for the two Parliamentsto legislate as one body, but some arrangement for occasional jointSessions might be worked out. A written Constitution of tJhe Unionproviding for joint organs of defence and economic policies could not doubt be drafted, and provided it was kept on very broad lines would seem to present no insuperable objection.(v) British Army.Objection was taken to the phrase &quot; Britain is raising at once a new army of several million men.&quot; This sentence would requireto be redrafted in more general terms.(vi) Unified Command.This proposal appeared unobjectionable. In present circum-stances, the British would in fact be predominant, more particularly at sea and in the air.The Secretary of State for Air expressed his warm supportof the proposal as a whole. He was all in favour of any means oftightening the union between the two nations.The Minister without Portfolio also supported the proposal.He stressed the need for keeping tJhe proclamation in as simple terms as possible, and making it clear that the Union included the wholeBritish Commonwealth of Nations and the French Empire.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs felt that if theproposal was meant to cover the peace after the war as well asthe period of the war itself, it raised issues which were toostupendous to give any opinion upon at such short notice. Theconstitutional difficulties would be very complex, including, forexample, the position of the Crown, and would take a generationto adjust. He had no idea how the Dominions would view thematter, but they would no doubt assent to any decision which wastaken by the Government of the United Kingdom. He also feared that the proposal might provoke very grave criticism in this country.If, however, the intention was that the document should relate tothe period of the war and the period immediately following it,then he would view it in quite a different light.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that we mustbe prepared to take some risks, but in his view there was nothing in the document which raised really fundamental issues except the phrase that &quot; France and Great Britain shall no longer be twonations but one/&apos;The Prime Minister said that his first instinct had been againstthe idea, but in this grave crisis we must not let ourselves be accused of a lack of imagination. Some dramatic announcement was clearlynecessary to keep the French going. The proposal could not belightly brushed aside, and he was encouraged to find such a bodyof opinion in the War Cabinet in favour of it.[Note. At 3-55 p.m. news was received: (a) That it had been announced on the French wirelessthat the Council of Ministers would meet at 5 p.m.to decide whether further resistance was possible.(6) That General de Gaulle had been informed byM. Reynaud on the telephone that if a favourableanswer on the proposed proclamation of unity wasreceived by 5 p.m. M. Reynaud felt that he wouldbe able to hold the position.][21424b] &quot; b 2
Several amendments to the draft proclamation were thenproposed and discussed in detail.After further discussion, the War Cabinet reached theconclusion that, while the draft declaration was not free fromdifficulty, the draft as amended did not present any insuperable difficulties; and that the right course was to proceed with it, havingregard to the prospect that it undoubtedly offered of enabling theresolute elements in France to hold their own.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft Proclamation of an Anglo-FrenchUnion as finally amended,* and authorised its despatch to M. Reynaud by the hand of General de Gaulle.(2) Authorised a message to be sent by telephone to M. Reynaudinforming him of the above in time for the meeting ofthe Council of Ministers fixed for 5 p.m.(3) Invited the Prime Minister, the Lord Privy Seal and theSecretary of State for Air to meet M. Reynaud at theearliest possible moment to discuss the draft Proclama-tion, and related questions.* Copy attached to these Conclusions as Annex IIRichmond Terrace, S. W. 1,June 16, 1940.
The Declaration of Union.First Draft.AT the most fateful moment in the history of the modern world, theGovernments of the United Kingdom and of the French Republic desire to make this declaration of indissoluble union and unyielding resolution in defence ofliberty and freedom against subjection to a system which reduces mankind to alife of robots and slaves.The two Governments declare that France and Great Britain shall no longer be two nations but one.There will thus be created a Franco-British Union.Every citizen of France will enjoy immediately citizenship of Great Britain;every British subject will become a citizen of France.The devastation of war, wherever it occurs, shall be the common responsi-bility of both countries and the resources of both shall be equally, and as one,applied to its restoration.All customs are abolished between Britain and France.There shall not be two currencies, but one.During the war there shall be one single War Cabinet.
