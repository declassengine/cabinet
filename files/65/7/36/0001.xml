The War Cabinet were informed that 11,000 men wereQuestion of due to sa^ on tne 8th June to the Middle East, as reinforcementsreinforcements. ^or various units. Some of the personnel concerned belonged to technical units, and some to fighting units. It had been suggestedthat it would be better that the reinforcements for fighting units at any rate should be retained in this country and formed intocomposite battalions.The War Cabinet thought that, unless there was strong reasonto the contrary, it was undesirable that these reinforcements shouldbe sent out to the Middle East at this moment, and invited theSecretary of State for War to re-consider the matter.Iceland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 127thConclusions,Minute 4.)Proposed des-patch of further reinforcements.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that recent telegrams from Iceland had contained representations that our forces on the island were not sufficient for its defence, and that further reinforcements were required. If this was so, it was worth considering whether it might not be better for us to remove theexisting force. As a first step, he proposed that the Chiefs of staff committee should be asked to consider the question.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theCanadian Government proposed to send a brigade to Iceland, whichwould enable us to relieve the brigade already there. This reliefwould not, however, strengthen the actual forces in Iceland.In reply to the Lord President of the Council, the First sea lord said that our object in holding Iceland was to prevent it being used as an aircraft base by the Germans. The Chiefs of staff committee had already discussed informally the adequacy of thepresent garrison, and had reached the conclusion that it was sufficient.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chiefs of Staff Committee to report on the size of the garrison which, in their view,tained in Iceland.should be main-U.S.S.R.Despatch ofSpecial mission to Moscow.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 132ndConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that on theprevious evening M. Maisky had told him that his Government hadno objection to Sir Stafford Cripps, or any other representativechosen by His Majesty&apos;s Government, coming to Moscow on aSpecial Mission, but they wished that representative to be a regularAmbassador and not a special envoy. He (the Foreign Secretary)had told M. Maisky that we intended to appoint a new Ambassador,who, however, would not be Sir Stafford. Would this satisfy theSoviet Government ? M. Maisky had not been able to give a definite answer.
172269 W.M. 141 (49).The Foreign Secretary added that he had told M. Maisky that sir Stafford could perhaps be appointed as an Ambassador on aSpecial Mission, but that he would much prefer that we should announce that we intended to appoint an Ambassador beforeSir Stafford reached Moscow.Sir Stafford Cripps, who was leaving that day for Athens by air, had agreed to serve as a Special Ambassador if necessary, butthe Foreign Secretary hoped that the Soviet Government would accept the solution which he had suggested.Ij, The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.certain british possesions.United States of        7.   The Seer eta? &quot;y of State for Foreign A ffairs referred to america. telegram No. 814, dated the 24th&apos; May,. 1940, from Flis Majesty&apos;sSuggested grant Ambassador, Washington : of facilities in .       .Various suggestions had been made that we should cedesome of our possessions in the New World to the United states in part payment of our war debt, but suggestions of this kindhad always been discouraged by President Roosevelt.Lord Lothian thought that we should consider making a formal offer to the United States Government that, while wewere not prepared to discuss any question of sovereignty, wewere prepared to lease to the United States landing grounds on British territory, in view of the importance of such facilities to U.S.A. security.    Lord Lothian mentioned particularlyTrinidad, Newfoundland and Bermuda.Lord Lothian believed that an offer of this kind made byus would make a deep impression in the United States and add to our security.  If we acted quickly, our action would have theadvantage also of spontaneity.   If this proposal were to be pursued, it was very desirable that Congress should vote thenecessary appropriations before its adjournment in early June.The Foreign Secretary thought that this was a proposal whichshould be examined, and suggested that the Chiefs of staff committee should be invited, in the first instance, to consider the strategical implications involved.The Prime Minister said that he would be opposed to a proposal that we should offer such facilities except as part of a deal. TheUnited States had given us practically no help in the war, and now that they saw how great was the danger, their attitude was thatthey wanted to keep everything which would help us for their own defence.The Lord President of the Council thought that the proposal would be open to less objection if the United States government took the lead in asking for these facilities, since, if we made theoffer, we should be playing straight into the hands of theisolationists.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the ideas underlying the present suggestions had been put forward as far back as theNaval Conference of 1930. We must not bargain away facilitiesessential for the defence of our Empire.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he hopedthat in any consideration of these suggestions he might be allowedto report on their probable effect both on Newfoundland, for whichwe were directly responsible, and also on Canada.
The War Cabinet (i) Invited the Chiefs of Staff Committee to examine the strategical implications of the suggestion made by HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, that we shouldlease landing grounds to the United States Governmentin Trinidad, Newfoundland and Bermuda,(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toreport on the probable effect in Newfoundland and canada of a decision to grant such facilities.Belgium.disappearance of His Majesty&apos;ambassador.The King of the belgians.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 138thConclusions,Minute 13.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that nonews had been heard of Sir Lancelot Oliphant, His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Brussels, since Monday, the 20th May, when sir Lancelot had reported that he was going to Le Havre. he proposed to ask the United States Embassy to make enquiries.The War Cabinet were informed that the King of the Belgianswas still with his troops, and was determined to remain with them.It was feared that, if he left, Belgian resistance would crumble.Arrangements had been made to enable the King to leave by air,and it was hoped that he would agree to do so when the time came.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that the Counsellor ofthe Belgian Embassy had called at the Foreign Office the previous evening and had said that the decision of the King of the Belgiansappeared to imply that he considered that the war was lost andwas contemplating a separate peace with Germany. The BelgianCabinet considered that the action of the King was tantamount todividing the nation and delivering it into Herr Hitler&apos;s protection.The Belgian Cabinet was the constitutional Government ofBelgium, and it was for this reason that they had transferredthemselves to foreign soil to continue the struggle.The Prime Minister asked to be supplied with a copy of the record of the interview in order that he might pass it on toSir Roger Keyes.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.British Strategy 9.

APPENDIX.Recommendations by the Chiefs of Staff.(W.P. (40) 168.)(i) We should do our utmost to persuade the United States of America toprovide aircraft, particularly fighters, as soon as possible and in large numbers,including those from stocks now held by the United States Army and Navy.(ii) Measures should be taken to ensure the strictest economy in A.A.ammunition expenditure.(iii) The most ruthless action should be taken to eliminate any chances of&quot; Fifth Column &quot; activities. Internment of all enemy aliens and all membersof subversive organisations, which latter should be proscribed.(iv) Alien refugees are a most dangerous source of subversive activity. Werecommend that the number of refugees admitted to this country should be cutto the minimum, and that those admitted should be kept under the closestsurveillance.(v) In order to ensure the necessary co-operation between Civil and Militaryauthorities, operational control of all Civil Defence Forces, including county andborough police, &amp;c, should be vested in the Ministry of Home Security andexercised through Regional Commissioners.(vi) Any evacuation which the Government intends to carry out in emergency should be carried out now. We recommend that a modification of the schemefor receptions areas, in view of the dangers of invasion, should be carried out.(vii) Immediate steps to be taken to obtain destroyers and M.T.Bs. from theUnited States of America.(viii) Every possible measure should be directed to obtaining the active support of Eire, particularly with a view to the immediate use of Berehaven.(ix) Our intelligence system to be strengthened with a view to getting early warning of German preparations for invasion of this country.(x) Dispersal of stocks of raw materials to free our West Coast ports to dealwith the heavy increase in imports should now be made.(xi) So far as is practicable, distribution of food reserves throughout thecountry with a view to meeting the disorganisation of transport which may occur.(xii) Bunkering facilities and other arrangements necessary to deal with a heavy volume of merchant shipping in West Coast and Irish ports shouldbe organised.(xiii) All unimportant and luxury imports to be cut out.(xiv) Finally we consider that the time had come to inform the public ofthe true dangers that confront us, and to educate them on what they are requiredto do and what not to do if the country is invaded.
