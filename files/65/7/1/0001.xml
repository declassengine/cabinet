The Secretary of State for A ir said that two Blenheims had completed a successful reconnaissance of Rye aerodrome (Denmark)and had returned. Fifty aircraft had been observed on the aerodrome and dispersed in trees. These fifty aircraft had consistedmostly of Junkers 88&apos;s and Heinkels 111&apos;s with what appeared tobe four-engined transports.   There had been no opposition.Six Blenheims had left on the previous afternoon for a dayattack on Stavanger.Two of these had carried out their task successfully, one hadover-shot the target and its bombs had fallen into the sea, and one had been chased by four Messerschmitts 110&apos;s and had not succeeded in dropping its bombs. One of the aircraft after dropping itsbombs had been attacked by a Messerschmitt 109 which had been shot down. About 150 aircraft had been seen on the runways anddispersed round the aerodrome.  Two of our machines were missing.Fourteen Wellingtons had attacked Stavanger &quot;on the previous night. Ten had completed the task, three were missing, and one hadcrashed in Yorkshire on its return. Balloons had been observed at between 6,000 and 7,000 feet, and Messerschmitt 110&apos;s and 109&apos;shad been encountered. One Messerschmitt 109 had been shot downin flames.Unfortunately the timing of this operation had not worked out according to plan. Fog had been forecast, and our aircraft hadbeen anxious to return before the fog descended. One of the two sections of Wellingtons engaged had arrived at its target beforedark with the result that it had suffered casualties. The sectionwhich had arrived after dark had suffered no casualties.A further night attack on Stavanger aerodrome had beencarried out by twelve Whitleys, of which eleven had returned, andone had not yet reported back. Three machines had completed their task and three had failed to attack. Reports from theremainder had not yet been received.A night attack on Aalborg aerodrome had been carried out by three Hampdens, of which one had completed its task, one had failed to find a target, and one had crashed in Norfolk on its return.Ten Whitleys had carried out a night attack on Fornebu. Ninehad returned or were reported on their way home. Preliminaryreports had stated that some aircraft had successfully carried out this attack, but further details were not yet available. One Whitleyhad not yet returned.An attack had also been carried out on Fornebu by fiveHampdens, all of which had returned safely. Four had carried out their task successfully but searchlights had prevented observation.Fires had been started and one hangar had been seen ablaze.These operations were being very carefully watched from thepoint of view of ensuring that undue risks were not taken, or losses sustained, in relation to the results likely to be achieved.Bad visibility had seriously interfered with flying.A section of Blenheim fighters had flown an offensive patrol ofRomsdale Fjord. No enemy aircraft had been seen and there hadbeen no anti-aircraft fire.At Aalesund two oil tanks on the island had been seen burning.At Andalsnes trees had been seen burning on the Northern edge of the hill and a house on fire on the west side of the Fjord.One Sunderland had flown to Namsos with two Army officers the previous evening.That morning three Hudsons had left to bomb stavanger aerodrome and three Blenheims had left for Romsdale Fjord.There had been little enemy activity during the previous day.Two plots had been traced, one off Southwold and one 60 miles outoff Flamborough Head. During the previous night 18 tracks had[21245] B 2
been plotted, one 40 miles east of Scapa, five in the Tyne area, one in the mouth of the Plumber and eleven in the Thames Estuary.These enemy aircraft had probably been engaged in mine-laying. The Tyne, llumber and Thames Estuary anti-aircraft defences had been in action with searchlights. The police had reported that an aircraft had alighted on the water off Margate anda Humber gun station had reported that an enemy aircraft hadopened fire on a searchlight.A Heinkel 111 had crashed in a garden at Clacton, and hadcaught fire. As a result four houses had been demolished and fiftydamaged. Four of the crew of the aircraft had been killed. Onecivilian had been killed and 97 injured, of whom 49 were in hospital.The weather had prevented fighter action. One fighter which hadtaken off from Martlesham had crashed near Lowestoft, the pilotbeing killed.The Home Secretary said that he feared that there were othercasualties besides those mentioned by the Secretary of State for Air.It appeared that there had first been an explosion in the air andafter the machine had crashed further explosions had taken place.Employment of The Secretary of State for Air said that he had mentioned to german bomber the War Cabinet a few days ago that the Air Staff considered that force in 10 per cent, of the German bomber force had been engaged in theScandinavia.      Norwegian operations.   The Air Staff now had reason to believethat about 25 per cent, of the German bomber force was being employed.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Naval 2.   The First Loral of the Admiralty said that the MinesweeperSituation. Dunoon had struck a mine near Smith&apos;s Knoll, North of the Thames(Previous Estuary, at 6-15 the previous day and had sunk.   There had beenEeferenee: 42 survivors, of whom 4 had been seriously injured. The DunoonW.M.

Tapping hadbeen heard at 3 o&apos;clock that morning and divers from Scapa werebeing hurried to the Tyne.The French destroyer Maille-Breze had caught fire at Greenockafter a big explosion the previous afternoon and had sunk later.About 50 casualties had been taken to hospital.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.3.   The War Cabinet were given the following information : (1) The oiler Boardale (8,334 tons) had been damaged bygrounding off Lango Island and had subsequently caughtfire and sunk.(2) The French Chasseurs Alpins had expected to make contact with German troops close to Bjerkvik that day. Britishtroops had occupied Ankanes.(3) Particulars were given of the A.A. gun defences alreadyinstalled in the Narvik area, of further guns in transit,and of the arrangements being made for the despatchof still further guns.(4) H.M.S. Glasgow was expected at Tromso at 8 p.m. that day, having on board the King of Norway and membersEnemy aircraftcrashes atClacton.Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M.

Namsos area.Trondhjem area.Andalsnes area.of his Government. The First Lord of the Admiraltyundertook to examine the question of strengthening theA.A. defences of Tromso.(5) H.M.S. Janus had embarked 100 men and two A.A. gunsthe previous evening at Namsos with a view to occupyingMosjoen. A company of soldiers with stores were to be landed from Ben My Chree at Mo, north of Mosjoen, inorder to prevent enemy landings there.(6) The sloop H.M.S. Bittern had been bombed continuouslythe previous day. At 3 p.m. she had been dive-bombed by waves of 8 Heinkels and had been set on fire. after being abandoned, she had sunk in deep water. the news from the forward area was good.(7) It had been decided to abandon the feint attack on the fortsat the entrance to Trondhjem Fjord, in order to ease the problems which the Commander-in-Chief had to facein connection with the withdrawal from Andalsnes.The blockade of Trondhjem was also being raised, as the destroyers employed in this operation were neededelsewhere.(8) H.M.S. Wanderer had gone ashore near Andalsnes at11-15 p.m. the previous night. She had reported thatshe might be able to move with the next high tide, butthe extent of the damage was not known.(9) There had been no direct communication with Andalsneson the previous day, and no message had been receivedfrom General Paget. Intermittent bombing of the townhad continued. There had been no ship in the port ofAndalsnes from the time H.M.S. Fleetwood had left onthe night of the 29th April until H.M.S. Auckland had arrived there on the evening of the 30th April.(10) 2,200 troops had been embarked the previous night fromAndalsnes, and 120 Royal Marines from Veblunoses.The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet an account of thereport which had been made personally to him .by Major Jefferis.Major Jefferis had been sent out to Andalsnes with instructions toblow up the Western railway in Central Norway. He had accordingly gone down the railway line and joined BrigadierMorgan&apos;s Brigade; but the Norwegians had categorically refusedto allow him to carry out any demolitions. He had been present when Morgan&apos;s Brigade had been engaged by the enemy. TheGermans had attacked with artillery, tanks, and armoured cars,which our own troops had been without. Far more destructivemorale, however, had been the low-flying attacks with bombs and machine guns. Although the casualties had not been so great asfrom shell fire, the moral effect of seeing the aircraft coming, ofbeing unable to take cover, of being able to observe the bombdropping, and of the terrific explosion, had been overwhelming.Major Jefferis had eventually found himself with the Germansbehind him. Picking up a sergeant and two privates, he had succeeded in making his way back to Andalsnes; and on the way hehad managed to blow up the girders of two bridges on the Germanside. He estimated that it would take some three weeks to repairthese. At Andalsnes the conditions of air attack had been such asto make it quite impossible to walk down to the jetty during daylight hours. He had spent a day in a sloop in the harbour, atwhich thirty bombs had been aimed. None had hit, but the immunity of a ship under such conditions could only be, in MajorJefferis&apos;s opinion, a matter of time, and he calculated that its lifewould probably not be more than three days.The general conclusion which he (the Prime Minister) drewfrom Major Jefferis&apos;s account was that it was quite impossible forland forces to withstand complete air superiority of the kind which
the Germans had enjoyed in Norway. This made it all the moreimperative to the success of our operations at Narvik that we should establish air bases in that area, not only for fighters, but also forbombers.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that full account hadbeen taken by the Service Departments of the need for establishingair bases in the Narvik area.Discussion as to the line to be taken by the Prime Minister inhis forthcoming Statement in the House of Commons on operations in Norway is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Italy: probable 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionintentions. to telegram No. 437 DIPP. dated 30th April, 1940, from His(Previous Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires, Rome, reporting that, in a conversationReference: with Lady Abingdon on the 28th April, Count Ciano had seemedW.M (40) 108th anxious to know what effect Italian Press propaganda was havingConclusions, *n tne United Kingdom, and had seemed relieved when he had been minute 8.) &apos; told that it was causing annoyance rather than anger; he had toldAttitude of Lady Abingdon that we should not take this propaganda tooItalian Press. seriously, and had added that he had explained the position toSir Noel Charles and hoped that the British Embassy understood.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.Navaldispositionsin theMediterranean.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 108thConclusions,Minute 10.)Italian linerRex.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 108thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that H.M.S. RoyalSovereign and H.M.S. Malaya, with three French battleships and a destroyer escort, were now on their way to Alexandria and had that morning been reported well east of Malta.The supply ship H.M.S. Resource had been ordered from Malta to Alexandria to assist the French in certain repairs which were needed to their three battleships.The Italian liner Rex had been reported to have sailed for new York.A number of submarines had arrived at the head of the suez canal from the China Station.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.TheMediterranean.Protection ofBritish shipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 106thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Prime Minister read telegram No. 280 from our ambassador in Cairo. He presumed that Sir Miles Lampson&apos;sstatement that the Admiralty were closing the Mediterranean toother than mail steamers was not true, and that the shipment ofmunitions to Egypt had not been cancelled.The Secretary of State for War confirmed that all ships with military stores for the Middle East were continuing to proceedthrough the Mediterranean.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that itmight be wise to balance the statement which had appeared in thePress that morning as to diversion of shipping from the Mediter-ranean, by a further statement on Naval dispositions. This state-ment would say that, owing to heavy German naval losses, thebalance of naval strength between the Allies and Germany had been
greatly altered, and that we were now able to revert to our normalFleet dispositions.The War Cabinet agreed That a statement on these lines should form part of thestatement on the general situation to be made by the PrimeMinister.   [See Minute 3 (Confidential Annex).]U.S.S.R.trade negotiations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 108thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatMr. Attlee had asked whether he could put down a Private notice question that afternoon on the subject of trade negotiations with soviet Russia. He had been told that this was not possible, but arrangements had been made for him to see Mr. R. A. Butler duringthe afternoon. The Soviet proposals were being examined by theDepartment concerned. If possible, a statement would be made inthe House of Commons the following day.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Sweden.Danger ofGermaninvasion.(previous reference erence:8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that at an interview the previous day, M. Colban, the Norwegian Minister,had handed him a Note containing the text of a telegram receivedfrom the Norwegian Minister in Stockholm, reporting the arrival of a considerable number of large German ships in the Oslo Fjord.M. Colban interpreted this as indicating the likelihood of a GermanW.M. (40) 100th attack upon Sweden.Conclusions, xhe First Lord of the Admiralty said that his naval advisersMinute 4.) were opposed to the despatch of surface war ships to the Skagerrak,in view of the risk of air attack. He agreed with this view.Submarines could be operated in this area, but with the full moonsubmarine action had had to be reduced. Personally, he saw no great objection to the Germans tying up considerable military forcesin Norway now that we did not intend to carry out a majorcampaign on that front, provided that they could be prevented fromoccupying Narvik.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the Chief of theImperial General Staff said that even if the Germans forced the swedes to allow them to transport troops northward by rail to attackNarvik or to seize Galivare, the railway facilities were not sufficientto enable an army of any considerable size to be maintained.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Germany:possible intentions.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 108thConclusions,Minute 8.)Belgium.Invasion ofGreat Britain.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 108thConclusions,Minute 4.)9. The Prime Minister drew attention to the following telegrams, which contained warnings as to Germany&apos;s intentions : (a) Telegram No. 440 DIPP, dated the 30th April, 1940, fromtlis Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires, Rome : Sir Noel Charles reported that, according to areliable informant just returned from Berlin, theGermans had made all preparations for an almostimmediate attack on Belgium and Luxemburg. the dates mentioned were the 1st and 2nd May, 1940; theinformation came in the first place from the UnitedStates Military Attache.(6) Telegram No. 341 DIPP, dated the 30th April, 1940, fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara : Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen reported havingbeen informed that, at a recent meeting in Budapest ofHungarian Military Attaches, a statement had beenmade that the Germans were preparing a vast numberof aircraft for dive-bombing and ground attack, and a
large number of small submarines, of which parts werebeing manufactured in different parts of Germany; withthese the Germans intended to make a great combinedattack on the Home Fleet; after this attack they intendedto land 25,000 men in England.(c) Telegram No. 178 DIPP, dated the 30th April, 1940, fromHis Majesty&apos;s Minister, Belgrade : Mr. Campbell reported that the Yugoslav GeneralStaff had that day informed the Assistant to the naval attache that a reliable source had reported that theS.S. Bremen and Europa had been standing byunder steam since the 23rd April at Stade nearHamburg; there were also large troop concentrations atStade; and it was believed that the German object wasto seize the Netherland islands from Texel eastwards.With these reports might also be read the statement in the previous day&apos;s Daily Intelligence Report that between 12 and 18 unidentifiedships and also 7 large ships had been observed at sea.A record of the subsequent discussion and the decision of theWar Cabinet is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by the PrimeMinister.TheNetherlands.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 96thConclusions,Minute 7.)The Balkans.Probable extent and effective-ness of allied assistance to turkey.(previous references:W.M. (40) 61stConclusions,Minute 8, andW.M. (40) 76thConclusions,Minute 6.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 140), in which hesuggested that a German drive into the Balkans, backed up byirresistible air forces, might cause the Balkan front to collapse. he proposed that the Chiefs of Staff should be asked to consider urgently whether, if such a drive took place, we should be ableeffectively to deny the Straits to Germany.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Turkish resistance in Thrace could hardly be compared with that of the Norwegians,which had proved so ineffective, but that, nevertheless, the effect ofuncontested air superiority might again prove decisive.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that, if the situationdeveloped as suggested, we should by that time be engaged in full-scale aerial operations in the West, and it was unlikely thatGermany could sustain a great effort there at the same time as in the balkans.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chiefs of Staff Committee to consider urgentlywhether, in the circumstances set out in the Memorandumby the Foreign Secretary, and on the assumption that italy was hostile, we should be able effectively and successfullyto assist the Turks, within the next few months, to preventthe Germans from reaching Constantinople and theStraits.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 1, 1940.
