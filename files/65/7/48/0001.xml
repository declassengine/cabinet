9^i&apos;V       o&apos;The western front.Evacuation ofthe B.E.F.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 152ndConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that the personnel of the B.E.F. had now been withdrawn to this countrypractically intact, except for their losses through casualties inaction. The French had not made any thing like full use of thefacilities available for the evacuation of their troops on the previous day and night. He proposed therefore to telegraph to M. Reynaud,urging the French to make every effort in co-operation with us to evacuate their men as quickly as possible.As regards the suggestion that the French might continue tohold their present position in Dunkirk more or less indefinitely,the Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that this course, evenif it were feasible, would be disadvantageous to us. The main-tenance of such a force would involve a far greater strain on our resources than its masking would on the enemy.He gave the following figures of numbers evacuated up to 6 a.m.on the 3rd June : British FitCasualtiesA Hies FitCasualties209,56413,004......      ......        69,017............ 795292,380Position at He had been told by General Alexander on his return to thisDunkirk. country that the Germans had not been pressing their attacks onthe perimeter, and had not used any armoured fighting vehicles,though there had been some infiltrations into the Allied line.Further evacuation would be very difficult as the pier and beacheshad now come under German artillery fire. Conditions were soconfused that General Alexander was uncertain how many french troops were left in the bridgehead.French The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadattitude to been warned by the Paris Embassy that General Weygand sawstatements in strong objection at the present stage to the publication of the total the Press. number of troops evacuated from Dunkirk.   He would see evenstronger objection to the publication of the numbers of troops ofdifferent nationalities which composed this total. The embassy had gathered that it was possible that General Weygand might be induced to reconsider his view as to the publication of the grand&apos;total, when evacuation had been completed. But he would probablymaintain his objection to the publication of the figures for thedifferent nationalities.Steps had been taken to warn the British Press accordingly.Suggested The Secretary of State for Air said that the Parliamentarybroadcast Secretary to the Minister of Information had suggested that Lordstatement. Gort, or some other Officer holding high military rank, should makea broadcast that evening to rebut statements put out by the Germans,first, that the French troops in the North-had run away; secondly,that the R.A.F. had not provided adequate air support.In discussion the view was generally expressed that for theCommander-in-Chief or some other Officer of high military rank to broadcast a rebuttal of these statements would attract undueattention to them. It would suffice if a suitable paragraph was included in the B.B.C. commentary, pointing out that these werethe usual German lies.[21376] b 2
Proposedmessage fromThe King toPresidentLebrun.The Foreign Secretary read to the War Cabinet the draft ofa message which, he suggested, His Majesty The King might be advised to send to President Lebrun on the conclusion of theevacuation.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that the draftmight be improved by the inclusion of a reference to the great part played by the Navy and Air Force.The War Cabinet :-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Invited the Foreign Secretary, after further consultationwith the Service Ministers, to submit to The King thedraft of a message from His Majesty to PresidentLebrun.The western front (con-tinued).B.E.F.experiences.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatpreliminary information as to the operations in which our troops had been engaged included the following points of interest : (1) The British troops had not for the most part been subjected to serious tank attacks. The usual German method hadbeen to attack by low-flying aircraft, followed up bytrench-mortar bombardment and then by small infiltra-tions of infantry with sub-machine guns through weakspots in the line. Experienced troops could make a goodstand against such attacks. Our troops had been ableto hold their line against attacks pressed by these methods.(2) The usefulness of the sub-machine gun had been demon-demonstrated. We had ordered a considerable number of thesefrom America some time ago and several hundred hadalready arrived.(3) The Bren gun carrier had proved very reliable, beingfrequently used as, in effect, a light tank. Our lighttanks themselves were not so well spoken of, beingsomewhat vulnerable and also extremely visible to theenemy.(4) Field guns constituted a useful anti-tank weapon only ifthey were supplied with armour-piercing shell. Shellsof this type had been ordered some time ago, but he wasnot certain what quantities were now being produced.There was also the possibility of fitting a special fusecap to ordinary high-explosive shells.The War Cabinet took note of these statements and invited the Secretary of State for War to take up withthe Minister of Supply, as a matter of urgency, theproduction of armour-piercing shells.3. The Chief of the Air Staff said that aircraft from the bomber Command had been engaged on the previous day in opera-tions against enemy batteries between Dunkirk and Gravelines.At night railway communications and troop movements south-W.M.

Dunkirk had been attacked, and reports showed that a conclusions, railway line had been hit.Minute 5.)Bomber Six Hampdens which had been ordered to attack marshallingCommand. yards at Rheydt and Duren had failed to find their targets, and reports were not yet available as to twelve Whitleys which had beensent to attack a hydrogenation plant at Hamburg. Other Whitleyshad bombed marshalling yards at Hamm, Osnabxmck, Duisburg andSoest.   All our machines had returned safely.The air situation.(previous reference:
Aircraft from the Coastal Command had concentrated their main effort in the Southern part of the North Sea. Two armed trawlers and many M.T.B.&apos;s had been attacked (seven near Borkum,three off Flushing, one near The Hook, and another North-West ofTexel). No visible successes had been achieved, but there had been several near misses.In fighting in the Dunkirk area we had inflicted on the enemy23 losses confirmed, and 32 unconfirmed, against 11 machines loston our own side (10 missing and 1 crashed at Margate).In fighting in Norway for the twenty-four hours ended 6 p.m.on the 2nd June the enemy losses were 6 confirmed and 8 uncon-firmed, one of our pilots being missing. Most of the enemy losses had been inflicted by our Gladiators.In answer to a question by the Secretary of State for War asto whether action was being taken to deal with reports of enemytank concentrations in the Hazebrouck area, the Chief of Air staff said that he did not think that any reports had yet been received in a sufficiently definite form to call for action, but that he wouldmake enquiries.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Naval 4.

The previous morning S.S. Polycarp (3,577 tons), bound fromLisbon to Liverpool, had been torpedoed and sunk south of Land&apos;sEnd.   The crew had been rescued by a French steamer.The S.S. Orford (20,043 tons) of the Orient Line had been sunk by bombing in Marseilles harbour the previous morning.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the First sea lord said that, now that the Germans had begun to bomb shipping in ports on the south coast of France, Admiral Darlan had been warned of the danger from dive bombing attacks on French warships.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of this statement.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to arrange for publicity to be given to the deliberate German attacks on hospital carriers.Norway. 5    Further discussion took place in regard to Allied operations(Previous in Norway.

Cadiz, where they would form an expeditionary force which would attempt to seize Ireland. The telegram spoke also of the Italianshaving under preparation an expedition whose objective would bethe seizure of Marseilles. It was difficult to know what degree ofimportance to attach to such reports; on the whole, his judgmentwas the same as Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s, namely, that it would be unwise to ignore them. No doubt the Chiefs of Staff had all these possibilities in view.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he hadalready communicated this information to Mr. de Valera.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Press. 9.   The Lord President of the Council said that on ThursdayCensorship of last Questions had been asked in the House of Commons indicatingletters and tnat certain places in this country were unprotected and wouldarticles. form admirable targets for German aircraft.  In particular, certain important water reservoirs had been mentioned.Steps had been taken to stop the publication of these Questions,and a letter had been addressed privately to Members of Parlia-ment, pointing out the extreme unwisdom of asking Questions whichconveyed information to the enemy.The Lord President said that he had been scandalised to see,in the Saturday issue of the Evening Standard, an article whichreproduced in substance the points dealt with in these Questions.He thought that it was intolerable that articles of this charactershould still continue to be printed.In discussion, it was pointed out that the submission of articlesto the Censor was voluntary. The view was expressed that the time had come when no articles dealing with military matters should bepublished before they had been submitted to the Censor. The samerule should apply to letters to the Press on military questions.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Information to consider what steps could be taken to ensure that no articles or letters on military questions were published in the Press before theyhad been submitted to, and passed by, .the Censor.
Bombardment 11.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePolicy. Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 186) explaining that the opening up ofthe war in the West had compelled us to adopt a wider interpre-tation of the term &quot;military objectives&quot; than was contained inthe instructions issued just before the outbreak of war. Therewould appear to be no advantage in restricting the action of ourCommanders more severely in one theatre than in another. It wastherefore proposed that the existing instructions should be cancelled, and revised instructions substituted therefor.The Lord President of the Council said that the actions takenby Germany on the Western Front provided the fullest justification for the course proposed.The War Cabinet :-Approved the revised instructions set out in Annex II tothe Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 186).Iceland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 141stConclusions,Minute 5.)12. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff as to the size of the garrison to be maintained in Iceland(W.P. (40) 187).The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff were satisfied that it was essential that we should.not only retain forcesin Iceland, but should reinforce them as soon as possible. Arrange-ments were being made whereby the existing Brigade should bereplaced by a Brigade of Canadian troops. The Chiefs of Staffrecommended that this force should be made up without delay to atotal of 5 Battalions, 1 Machine-gun Battalion and the necessaryaircraft, with the addition of a further Battalion in the ensuingwinter.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that thismatter had been informally discussed with the Canadian authori-ties, and that he thought the matter should now be taken up on theofficial plane.The War Cabinet :-(1) Approved the proposals set out in - the Chiefs of staff report.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, afterconsultation with the Service Departments, to make a formal approach to the Canadian Government asking them to assume responsibility for the defence of Icelandon the general lines suggested in the Report.The Western 10.
