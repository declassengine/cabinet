The Senatehad already voted $50 millions for relief of refugees in Prance.He also referred to the Fleet position.The Prime Minister read a draft reply which he had prepared.In this draft he stressed his disappointment that the President hadnot seen his way to agree to publication of the message of the13th June. He pointed out that events were now moving very fast,and that nothing short of a declaration of war by the United states would be likely to sustain the French much longer. The draftalso stressed the importance of our receiving immediate help indestroyers.The following points were made in discussion : (1) The Lord President of the Council thought that the PrimeMinister might stress the moral and psychological effectof an American declaration of war.(2) It was agreed that our need for destroyers should be evenmore strongly pressed.The War Cabinet took note of this statement and agreedthat a reply should be sent on the lines suggested.United States ofAmerica.Germanattempts toinfluenceopinion.Hitler&apos;s inter-view with aTJ.S.A.journalist.2. Arising out of the discussion recorded in the previousMinute the Minister of Information said that German agents inAmerica had undoubtedly reported to Hitler the tremendous swingof American opinion in favour of the Allies. Reports of an interview granted by Hitler to a United States journalist had appeared in the American press, but had not yet been released inthis country. Hitler had been reported as saying that he had nodesigns on the Western Hemisphere, and no intentions of smashingup the British Empire; he only wished to rid it of its presentmisguided leaders. Hitler was obviously alarmed at the prospectof active American participation in the war. It had been reportedthat President Roosevelt had said that Hitler&apos;s statement remindedhim of certain assurances that he heard before, but this state-ment together with German military successes was having someeffect in the United States. A report of this interview was being prepared for release in this country. He would circulate the full text of the interview to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Western 3.   The Prime Minister said that things had gone badly in front. France on the previous day.   A message had been received from(Previous General Brooke, saying that General Weygand had stated that reference:        organised French resistance had come to an end, and that theW.M. (40) 166th French Army, while continuing to fight, was disintegrating intoConclusions,      disconnected groups.  General Brooke had asked permission to sendMinute 2.) &apos;      back two Brigades of the 52nd Division, as they could not at themoment play any useful part in the struggle.   After speaking toGeneral Brooke on the telephone he had agreed to this course, not[21416] b 2
as a matter of policy but as a matter of local military necessity.He had also stopped the further movement to France of theCanadian Division, one Brigade of which had already crossed.The Prime Minister then read the telegrams* which had beensent to M. Reynaud and to General Brooke as the result of decisions taken late the night before.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said it was believedthat, two Brigades of the 52rid Division were being withdrawn toCherbourg. An officer had flown back that morning from GeneralBrooke &apos;s Headquarters, and had said that there were gaps betweenthe French Armies and that concerted control was now impossible.The Beauman Division, 157th Brigade, and a composite ArmouredRegiment, all under General Marshall-Cornwall, remained under control of the 10th French Army. General Marshall-Cornwall^Headquarters were near Chartres. The withdrawal of troops from our lines of communication had begun. Particulars were given ofthe distribution of our troops on the lines of communication,amounting in all (including air force personnel) to 100,000.He then read a telegram received late the previous night fromthe Swayne Military Mission, to the effect that General Georgesconsidered it inevitable that France should demand an armistice,and that every hour&apos;s delay increased the danger that the army would become disorganised. This was said to be the view of all french Military Commanders, and it had been impressed on Swaynethat although the Government had so far taken no decision theywere aware of the military opinion.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff then referred to the message sent to the French informing them that orders had beenissued to General Brooke that he was to act independently of french command, but in co-operation with any French forces in his view.A reply had been received over the telephone from a French StaffOfficer to the effect that the message had not been well received andthat there was no intention of releasing General Brooke from french command.The Prime Minister emphasised that General Brooke, though no longer under French Command, should try to co-operate withany French Forces that were still fighting and should make everyeffort to sustain French resistance. The withdrawal of the two brigades of the 52nd Division should not be taken as a sign thatall British Forces were about to withdraw.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that in the area where the British Forces were operating there was every indication that the French Army were ceasing to fight, and were becoming-disorganised.In discussion it was also pointed out that there was a grave risk that, if the French Army Commanders agreed to an armistice,our troops might find themselves involved and unable to escape, ashad happened at St. Valery.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out thatthe French might, nevertheless, go on fighting elsewhere. If so, our withdrawal might occasion the very political reactions in Francewhich we wished to avert.The Prime Minister said that he had made it clear in his telegram to M. Reynaud the reasons for our withdrawal. Hesuggested that for the time being our troops should remain atCherbourg, so that if a fresh opportunity arose they could be ordered to proceed elsewhere in France.* Annexes I and II.
The naval situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 166thConclusions,Minute 3.)operations against Italianseaboard.Italian U-boats.Enemy attacks on trade.4. The Chief of Naval Staff informed the War Cabinet thata brief message had been received at the Admiralty to say that theFrench Navy had carried out a bombardment of objectives at Genoa,but no details were as yet available.The Prime Minister suggested that now that this operation hadbeen carried out, further consideration should be given to action onthe same lines by the British Navy against Italian objectives.It was pointed out that an attack on the West Coast of italy was a different matter from an attack on the East Coast, both asregards the risks from Italian aircraft, the strength of which hadnot yet been tried, and as regards the dividend to be obtained.Broadly, there were hardly any worth-while targets on the east coast of Italy.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the question of attacking objectives in Italy had been very thoroughly examined by the Admiralty, and he thought that it would be premature todraw deductions from the action taken by the French Fleet againstGenoa until full details had been received.Referring to an enquiry which had been made at a previous meeting, the Chief of Naval Staff said that there were a numberof Italian submarines which would have the range to reach the cape of Good Hope from the Red Sea, and to return, but with very little margin. This, added to the fact that the winter weatheroff the Cape was very bad at this time of the year, made it very unlikely that they would attempt this operation.The S.S. Balmoral Wood (5,834 tons) had been torpedoed off cape Clear.H.M.S. Dorsetshire, after leaving convoy duty, had attacked a U-boat off Gibraltar on the previous afternoon and reported thatit had either destroyed or badly damaged it.The total number of troops evacuated by sea from St. Valerywas now stated to be 2,280.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Spanish Terri- 5.   The Chief of Naval Staff said that on the night of thetorial Waters. 13th-14th June, one of our anti-submarine patrols sighted a submarine on the surface south of Almina Point. As the submarine had been in Spanish territorial waters our patrol had not attackedit. Later the submarine had fired a torpedo, which had missed,and had then sought refuge in Almadrama Bay, near Ceuta. Fromthis and other reports it was clear that Italian vessels were misusingSpanish territorial waters. Not only did this enable them to makeattacks under conditions very disadvantageous to us, but it would the Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that this couldbe done for the time being; but there was considerable risk thatenemy bombing might make the withdrawal of the force laterimpossible if evacuation became necessary.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Approved the instructions issued to General Brooke.(iii) Instructed the Chief of the Imperial General Staff toissue orders to General Brooke that the two Brigadesof the 52nd Division which had been ordered to returnto the ports should not re-embark, but should for thepresent remain in the neighbourhood of the ports,available either to re-embark at short notice or to proceedelsewhere if so ordered.
also enable Italian submarines to make their way to the Atlantic.He asked that permission should be given to our patrolling craft to operate against Italian submarines in Spanish territorial waters.In discussion, the following points were made : (i) Clearly British ships had a right to return the attack ofvessels which attacked them from territorial waters.(ii) The question whether we should authorise our vessels tosweep Spanish territorial waters in search of submarinesmight raise an issue with the Spanish Government. Itwas most desirable to avoid any action which might bring Spain into the war against us.The War Cabinet agreed as follows (1) That the British Ambassador to Madrid should be instructed to inform the Spanish Government of the attack which has been made on one of our vessels fromSpanish territorial waters and to say that in any similarcase we should be obliged at once to retaliate against such attack delivered from Spanish territorial waters.(2) That the Ambassador should be further instructed toinform the Spanish Government that he had reason tobelieve that Italian vessels were using Spanishterritorial waters as a passage to the Atlantic, fromwhich they intended to attack our shipping. It was clearly necessary that we should protect ourselvesagainst such actions. Accordingly we proposed to issue instructions to our Naval Commanders (a) That any attack by enemy submarines delivered fromSpanish territorial waters should at once bereturned.(&amp;) That, when we had reason to believe that enemy submarines were using territorial waters, sweepsfor them should be carried out in those waters.(3) That such sweeps should not be carried out until the reaction of the Spanish Government had been ascertained.(4) That the Admiralty should be authorised to issue instructions on the lines of (1) to our Naval Commanders,but that further action by way of sweeps should notbe undertaken until the reaction of the SpanishGovernment had been ascertained.Plans to meetCertainEventuality.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 166thConclusions,Minute 10.)a 6. Discussion took place on a number of questions arising outof plans to meet a certain eventuality. A record of the points raised, and of the Conclusions reached, is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 166thConclusions,Minute 1.)fighter command.7. The Chief of the Air Staff said that during the previous day 260 fighter patrols had been flown. No enemy aircraft hadbeen intercepted, but one of our Hurricanes had experienced enginetrouble and had landed in enemy territory.
bomber command.tCoastalCommand.British AirForces inFrance.operations against italian forces.Day operations.Sixty sorties had been made by Blenheims during the previous day, of which 36 had been directed against enemy columns in theLower Seine area. Low clouds had interfered with these opera-tions. Twenty-four of the Blenheims had attacked Mervilleaerodrome and bombs had dropped amongst 40 aeroplanes drawnup almost wing tip to wing tip. On the return flight, the bombershad reported an even greater concentration of aircraft at Aire,which they had been unable to attack as they had used all theirbombs.Night operations.Seventy-two Hampdens, Whitleys and Wellingtons had left toattack diverse targets, including railway marshalling yards inGermany, military objectives in the Black Forest area, railwayjunctions and enemy communications in France, and troop con-concentrations immediately behind the German front line. rt W &quot;bombs had also been dropped in the Rhine. No detailed reports had yet been received concerning these operations.The normal anti-submarine, anti-invasion and convoy escortpatrols had been flown.A reconnaissance by 3 Hudsons had revealed 30 or 40 merchant ships in Bergen. A formation of Hudsons and Beauforts had leftto attack this concentration. From preliminary reports it appeared that the shipping had left before the arrival of the attackingformation. A reconnaissance of Trondhjem showed that the 2cruisers previously reported had left, but that the Scharnhorst,which had been successfully attacked by the Fleet Air Arm onThursday, was still in harbour.Ninety-three Battle sorties had been made against enemy concentrations in the Lower Seine, and other areas to the rear ofthe German forces.Frontier of Egypt and Libya.Bombs had been dropped at Sollum, and on an -Italian post atFort Cap Pruzza.A den.Reconnaissances and bomb-raids had been made. It was believed that 7 enemy aircraft had been destroyed on the ground,as the result of an air raid on Assab.Malta.On the 13th June, two air raids had taken place againstKalafrana aerodrome. Two Army personnel had been killed andone wounded.Cloudy weather conditions had enabled the enemy to avoidbeing intercepted by our fighters. On the previous day there hadbeen some damage to civilian property near Valetta harbour as theresult of an air raid.The First I,ord of the Admiralty said that a message hadbeen received from the Governor of Malta asking for additionalfighter protection. He had reported that in spite of fairly frequentraids the population of Malta was maintaining its morale.The Chief of the Air Staff pointed out that Hurricanes couldnot operate effectively in Malta without spares and ground equip-ment, and that it would be folly to send them there in theseconditions.   Gladiators were already available.Sudan-Kenya.No official reports had been received, but it appeared that two small towns in the Sudan had been raided. Practically no damagehad resulted.
9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs again referred       (to the telegrams to which he had drawn the attention of the WarCabinet on the previous day (Angora telegrams Nos. 540, 541, 544and 545).In a discussion of the situation with the Prime Minister onthe previous evening, it had been agreed that the best plan was tomake the best of a bad job.Accordingly he had telegraphed to Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen (Foreign Office telegrams to Ankara Nos. 455 and 456),instructing him to inform the Turkish Government that we were unable to regard the attitude which they had taken up as a fulfil-ment of their undertakings to the Allies. The present decision could only make the most deplorable impression on the world at large. We could not accept their proposed declaration in its present form, but we were prepared to accept it with certain modifications.In particular he desired that the following amendments should be incorporated in the second paragraph : &quot; Following upon the entry of Italy into the war against great Britain and France, the Government of the Republichas decided in agreement with its Allies to adopt for thepresent an attitude of non-belligerency.&quot;It was to be made clear to the Turkish Foreign Minister that the alteration of the words &apos;&apos; the Allied Governments &quot; to &quot;its Allies &apos;&apos;and still more the addition of the words &apos;&apos; for the present&apos;&apos; werein our view essential.The Ambassador had also been instructed to say that we expected the Turkish Government to recall their Ambassador fromRome, and to give the Italian Ambassador in Angora his passports,and also to take the other measures appropriate in the case of a breach of diplomatic relations. Of these, we considered a stoppage of commerce with Italy to be of more importance than the expulsionor internment of Italians. The Turkish Government might welltake measures similar to those which the Egyptian Government hadtaken in the case of Germany and Italy. These included the enforcement of censorship, the enactment of legislation againsttrading with the enemy, and the institution of exchange control.The Prime Minister said that we might well learn a lesson in propaganda methods from the Germans. When at the beginningof the war Italy had refused to come in, the Germans had put it out that they did not desire her participation.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Turkey.Action in conse-quence of italian declara-tion of war.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 166thConclusions,Minute 7.)Switzerland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 7.)10. The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs drew attentionto Angora telegram No. 31, dated the 13th June, which was to theeffect that Polish sources in Switzerland reported that agreement had finally been reached between the Swiss Government and thearmy concerning the free passage of German troops. The swiss government would capitulate to a military coup d&apos;that, and theGermans would be allowed through.Operations 8.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that ouragainst Libya,    land forces had now taken the Italian fort, Cap Pruzza (see minute 7) securing four officer prisoners and one hundred rank and file.   Most of the latter were presumably native troops.Our total casualties so far reported in this attack were threeEgyptian other ranks.   These casualties were due to enemy air action.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
The Foreign Secretary hoped that he was right in regardingthis as rather a wild story. He had telegraphed to Mr. Kelly at berne asking whether he could throw any light upon it (ForeignOffice telegram to Berne No. 152, dated the 14th June).The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.U.S.S.R.Reported troop movements.Possibility of a move bv the11. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in reply to aquestion, said that he had no confirmation of the report that theU.S.S.R. forces had been massed near the frontier of East Prussia.The Foreign Secretary said that, when he saw the american ambassador later in the day, he proposed to ask if the U.S.A. couldUnited States of exert pressure on Russia to&quot; detach her from Germany.  Admittedlyit was far from clear what means of pressure were open to theAmerican Government.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.America.Meeting of 12.   The War Cabinet discussed the desirability of summoningParliament. Parliament earlier than Tuesday, the 18th June, the day on which(Previous it would next meet in the ordinary way.   It was thought that reference: Parliament would certainly expect a statement from the Govern-W.M.

(40) 39thConclusions,Minute 12.)13. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (G.) (40) 149) as tothe reply to be made to an enquiry recently received from the IraqiMinister for Foreign Affairs.The Foreign Secretary outlined the main arguments of his paper, and said that he had thought it right to raise this question in view of the changes in the War Cabinet since the matter had last been discussed.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had always been opposedto the policy of the White Paper. He was not satisfied that it wouldbe desirable to re-affirm that policy publicly at the present moment,in view of the dangerous effects which this might have upon opinion in America.The Minister without Portfolio said that he agreed generally with the Lord Privy Seal. The White Paper policy had alwaysgiven rise to strong divisions of opinion in the House of Commons.An announcement of the kind proposed might have serious reper-cussions on opinion in America, where the influence of the jewish community was out of all proportion to their numbers.At the same time, while regretting that the Government were committed to this policy, he considered that it would be impossibleto go back upon it now and was prepared, though reluctantly, to concur in the issue of the proposed declaration, if the War Cabinetthought this necessary.The Secretary of State for Air associated himself with theposition taken up by the Minister without Portfolio, although[21416] c
he thought that the effect of such a declaration on the Arab worldmight prove to be transient only, and might encourage freshdemands for more immediate action.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he thought itwas impossible to evade the question put by General Nuri. unless some plain reassurance were given regarding our policy in Palestine,there was a risk that the situation in Iraq and the Middle East,which was already unsatisfactory, might flare up dangerously.The Lord President of the Council recalled that on an earlieroccasion, in the lifetime of the previous Government, a compromisehad been found by avoiding any explicit statement of our attitude.It was difficult, however, still to adhere to this course now thatGeneral Nuri had put to us a definite question. He himself feltthat, to a certain extent, the question was academic. Any promisewhich we made must be subject to the uncertainties of the future.It was, however, of great importance to encourage the pro-british element in Iraq, where the situation was by no means satisfactory.He suggested certain drafting amendments in the terms of theproposed reply to General Nuri, which he thought might help tomeet the position of those members of the War Cabinet who had opposed the White Paper policy.   These were : (1) That the first sentence of the suggested answer should read &quot; The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government forPalestine has not been changed from that laid downin the White Paper of May 1939.&quot;(2) That the final sentence should read &quot; But they hope and expect that when the waris ended conditions in Palestine will permit thevarious stages of constitutional development tofollow one another in orderly succession on thelines which the White Paper lays down.&quot;Subject to these amendments he supported the proposals of theForeign Secretary.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretaryof State for the Colonies were prepared to accept these two amend-ments.The Foreign Secretary thought that the broad flow of American opinion was likely to be influenced at the present time by far wider considerations than were involved in our policy towards Palestine.Even Dr. Weizmann and his fellow Zionists must realise that therewould be little hope for them if Germany were not defeated.The Prime Minister, in summing up the discussion, said thathe saw no reason to give an immediate reply to General Nuri&apos;senquiry. Iraq had done nothing to deserve special considerationfrom us, and would be far more likely to be impressed by militarysuccesses achieved against Italy. The present was a most criticalmoment for the development of American opinion. Importantevents might soon take place which would affect our power to carryout any promise we might give.The War Cabinet agreed (1) To defer for consideration in three or four days&apos; time, thequestion of the reply which might be given to GeneralNuri.(2) To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for the Colonies,to watch the situation closely in the meantime, and advise the Prime Minister of any developments whichmight make necessary an immediate decision.
Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 15, 1940.Iraq: Internal 14.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bySecurity. the Chiefs of Staff Committee, suggesting the adoption of certain measures for the improvement of the attitude of the Iraqi Govern-ment and people towards the Allied cause (W.P. (40) 205).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, while notopposing the suggestions made in the Memorandum, he thoughtthat the real difficulty was that few people in Iraq really thoughtthat we would win the war.As regards the specific suggestions in the report, his views were(i as follows : (i) We should continue to press the Iraqi Government to liveup to the Treaty.(ii) He supported the proposal for an increase of propagandaof every kind, particularly the better use of the Baghdadbroadcasting station. The economic condition of thepeople, on which it was suggested that money should be spent would not, in his view, be decisive.(iii) Every encouragement should be given to Ibn Saud to demonstrate his friendship to this country.(iv) If the French could be induced to promise a more liberalconstitution to Syria after the war, this would exercise a substantial effect on the situation. It was, however,optimistic to expect the French, in present circumstances,to co-operate in this matter.(v) He did not disagree with the suggestion of offeringfinancial inducements, but thought that there was some danger of throwing money away.The Secretary of State for the Colonies strongly supported theproposals, and thought that it was essential that money should be spent. The Germans had bought up all the newspapers in Iraq andwere able to influence public opinion by anti-British propaganda.He was certain that the expenditure of funds on political objects inIraq would secure some of the results which were hoped for.The War Cabinet gave general approval to the suggestions made by the Chiefs of Staff Committee in paragraph 3 oftheir Memorandum (W.P. (40) 205).
ANNEX I.(Most Secret.)FOLLOWING from Prime Minister for M. Reynaud :-General Brooke has informed C.I.G.S. that General Weygand has told him that organised French resistance had ceased.In these circumstances, I feel sure you will agree that the Allied Cause would best be served by our stopping the disembarkation of any further British Forcesin France till the situation is more clear. Orders have therefore been issued tothis effect, and also to evacuate the very large L. of C. personnel between Rennesand Nantes.Meanwhile, General Brooke has been ordered to act in conjunction with any French Forces which may be fighting in his vicinity and to retire with the FrenchXth Army upon Le Mans.ANNEX II.To General Brooke,YOU are no longer under French command, but will co-operate with any French Forces which may be fighting in your vicinity. In view of your report received stating that organised resistance has come to an end, you must nowprepare for the withdrawal of your force to the United Kingdom, but this decision can only be taken by agreement between the two Governments. Meanwhile, you have full authority to act in accordance with your plan contained in your telegramNo. 239 of 14/6. All lines of communication troops and available military stores should be evacuated forthwith. Ships are being sent to-night Cherbourg.Brest, St. Nazaire and St. Malo. Report broad outline plan giving ports youintend, to use and approximate numbers to be embarked. Barratt will be instructed to concert arrangements with you for withdrawal and cover.
