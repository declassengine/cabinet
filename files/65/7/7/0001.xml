The Solicitor- 1.   The Prime Minister said that the War Cabinet would be general. grieved to hear that Sir Terence O&apos;Connor had died early that morning.The Prime Minister undertook to send a message of sympathy,on behalf of the War Cabinet, to Lady O&apos; Connor.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 114thConclusions,Minute 2.)bomber command:coastal command.fighter command.2. The Secretary of State for Air said that there had been no operations during the previous day. On the previous night9 Wellingtons had been despatched to attack Stavanger, but owingto the poor visibility only one had located and attacked the target.Only light A.A. fire had been encountered. One Messerschmitt 110had been seen, but had not attacked.Five Wellingtons had been despatched to patrol enemy seaplanebases but had been recalled owing to reports of bad weather conditions. Two aircraft which had failed to receive the recallsignal had seen nothing owing to extremely poor visibility. one aircraft had reported a convoy of about 20 ships about 45 miles west of Terschelling at 10 p.m. No escort had been observed. The vessels had been showing riding lights and some deck lights, and had appeared to be of the small cargo or trawler class.Reconnaissance of the Norwegian coast from Lister Lightnorthwards to Sonje Fjord had revealed nothing of particular interest.As reported on the previous day, 6 Beauforts of No. 22Squadron had taken off about 2-30 a.m. on the morning of the7th May to attack a cruiser of the Leipzig or Nuremberg classreported to be at anchor off Norderney. Only one aircraft hadlocated the target. No hit was claimed. One Beaufort had been attacked by a Messerschmitt 109 and hit, the resulting damagecausing it to crash on landing. One Beaufort was missing.Subsequent reconnaissance of the Norderney area had failed tosight the cruiser.   Visibility had been 20 miles.There had been little enemy activity to report.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The NasalSituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 114thConclusions,Minute 3.)Mine-sweeping.Degaussing ofships.Danish fishing vessels.3. The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that magnetic mineshad been exploded in Blyth (which was now open), Margate roads and Swansea, and a moored mine had been cut 15 miles east of theGoodwins.[21270]It was still the case that no degaussed ship had been mined,except for one vessel which had lost her degaussing apparatus in heavy seas.A number of Danish fishing vessels had been reported about150 miles east of the Yorkshire coast on the morning of the .7th May.Two corvettes had been sent to this position to escort to the Humberany that might be found. (The whaler class had now beenrechristened &quot;corvettes,&quot; an old name revived. They were some-what smaller vessels than sloops.) Two other captured Danishtrawlers were being escorted to Aberdeen.The French destroyer Unison was carrying out a sweep off theDutch and Belgian coasts as far north as Egmond, and was expectedto return to Dunkirk that evening.Mine-laying operation B.S.2 (off Lowestoft) had been com-pleted.b 2
HMS. War spite had made good progress on her passage toMediterranean.   Alexandria and was now some 50 miles west of Malta.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 112thConclusions,Minute 2.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 114thConclusions,Minute 7.)Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 114thConclusions,Minute 4.)Ivirkenes area.Narvik area.Mo area.The Mediterranean had been partially re-opened to shipping.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.4.   The War Cabinet were given the following information : (1) HATS. Devonshire was proceeding to Kirkenes to investigate the position. There was no confirmation ofthe report that there were 200 German sailors at murmansk who intended to move against Kirkenes.(2) HM.S. Ark Royal had been operating in this area since the7th May.The Balzac (the store-ship with A.A. material forNarvik) which had grounded the previous day in theMinches, had now arrived at Stornoway. Her gear wasto be transferred to another ship as soon as possible.The other damaged ship, the Coxwold (with oil supplies for Narvik), was due at Scapa, escorted by another ship.(3) There was no confirmation of reports that German forces had occupied Mo or Mosjoen. So far as was known, the nearest enemy was 100 miles from Mosjoen.Our three independent companies in northern norway had been put under the general command ofLord Cork.  Their distribution was as follows : (a) Mo (200 troops);(b) Bodo (400 troops when the operation is complete);(c) Mosjoen (400 troops and Headquarters due that evening, when the French troops at present therewere to be evacuated).(4) The Prime Minister said that he had been informed by theNorwegian Foreign Minister that the mines atSulitjelma, near Bodo, were iron mines and not coppermines, and were not of great importance.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that a further telegram had been received from Lord Cork as to operations at narvik.A record of the discussion, and of the Conclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Iceland.Arrangementsfor occupation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 113thConclusions,Minute 10.)5. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that two cruisers(H.M. ships Glasgow and Berwick) and two destroyers had sailedfor Iceland that morning. They were expected at Reykjavik at a.m. on Friday, the 10th May.The A.M.C. California had been ordered to patrol off theEastern fjords of Iceland, to forestall any landing of enemy troopsby trawlers or other small craft, especially near Seidis Fjord, wherethe telegraph cables came to land.
The Chief of the Air Staff said that, as instructed by the WarCabinet, the Chiefs of Staff had considered &quot;whether any additionalforces would be required to ensure the protection of Iceland against german attack.&quot;  They thought that one battalion of Royal Marineswould not be a sufficient force for holding the Island, and they hadTerritorial        given instructions that a brigade of Territorials should proceed tobrigade to be     Iceland.  On being relieved by the Territorials, the Marines woulddespatched.       return to this country.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, as soonas the occupation of Iceland was an accomplished fact, he thoughtthat a communique should be issued to the Press and the B.B.C.He read out a draft. This draft was approved, subject to amend-ment of one paragraph.The War Cabinet (i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Agreed that as soon as our forces had landed in Iceland,a communique should be issued on the lines proposed bythe Foreign Secretary.Issue ofcommunique.The netherlands and Belgium.possible german attack.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 110thConclusions,Minute 6.)Air action in theevent of aGerman attackon holland and/or Belgium.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 114thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 137 DIPP from The Hague, dated the 7th May,reporting that an attack on the Low Countries and the western front was to be expected at dawn on the 8th, or shortly afterwards.Subsequent enquiries rather discounted this report, which mightwell be a German feint. The French agreed with this view, andregarded as more serious the rumours of a German offensive throughHungary.The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State forAir said that various precautionary measures had been taken theprevious evening.The Foreign Secretary also referred to telegram No. 113 DIPPfrom our Ambassador at Brussels, who had passed on to M. Spaakthe report that a German attack on the Low Countries was imminent. M. Spaak had been given to understand by the BelgianAmbassador in Berlin that the German authorities were drafting aNote to be presented, at an appropriate moment, to the Netherlandand Belgian Governments : he was not aware whether this wouldbe in the form of an ultimatum.M. Spaak had told the French Ambassador in Brussels that theposition of Belgium vis-a-vis the Allies was the same as they had indicated on the 10th April. M. Spaak had added that, in his own opinion, if attacks were made, the Belgian Government should make an immediate appeal to the Allies.A record of the further discussion on this matter, and of theConclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.
France.Command ofAllied naval forces in theMediterraneanand land forcesin the NearBast,(previous reference:W.M. (40) 98thConclusions,Minute 7.)Action to betaken in theevent of Italyentering thewar.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 108thConclusions,Minute 13.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 106thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Prime Minister drew attention to telegram No. 175DIPP dated the 7th May, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Paris, containing an account of various questions which M. reynaud had that evening informed Sir Ronald Campbell had been underdiscussion in the French War Committee. The first of these related to the question of the command of Allied naval forces in theMediterranean, and the command of the Allied land forces in theNear East. In both cases M. Reynaud had urged that the question should be settled at an early date in favour of France.M. Reynaud had also said that he was disturbed at the inadequacy of the measures which the Allied General Staffs seemedready to contemplate in the event of war with Italy. He remainedconvinced that the right way to deal with the Italians in the eventof war was to hit them hard and at once. The Prime Minister addedthat this latter declaration was in striking contrast with the attitude adopted by M. Reynaud at the 9th Meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs enquired whethersatisfactory progress was being made in the discussions between theBritish and French Air Staffs for the provision of aerodromes forthe Royal Air Force in Southern France in the event of war with italy; and also what progress had been achieved in the discussions which, it had been agreed, should be initiated between British andFrench Staffs for the purpose of preparing an up-to-date statement on the military action which would be open to the Allies to take in the event of their becoming involved in war with Italy. Itwas desirable that this report should be made available as soonas possible, since on it turned the political decisions which weshould have to take and on which we should need to secure theconcurrence of the French and Turkish Governments.The Chief of the Air Staff said that as regards the first ofthese questions, arrangements were proceeding satisfactorily,though General Vuillemin had expressed the view that the FrenchGovernment would not agree to the bombing of targets in theindustrial area of Northern Italy until the Germans had firstbombed France.As regards the second question, the Chiefs of Staff had reached agreement among themselves as to the military action open to theAllies, and the document which they had prepared was now being discussed with the French through the Allied Military Committeein London, tie added that the French Representatives on theCommittee were experiencing great difficulty in obtaining decisionsfrom the French High Command.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.
Malta and gibraltar.Evacuation ofService families.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 106thConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff Committee (W.P. (40) 147) recommending that the transports now being held at Malta and Gibraltar for the possibleevacuation of Service families in accordance with the conclusionof the War Cabinet mentioned in the margin, should now be released, so that, they could be used for the conveyance of reinforce-ments to the Middle East.It was explained that these transports would not be broughtall the way back to the United Kingdom, but would pick up there reinforcements at Marseilles.The War Cabinet Approved the Chiefs of Staff Report, and authorised therelease of the transports now held at Malta and Gibraltar.Food Rationing. 9 The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the sugar. Minister of Food (W.P. (G.) (40) 121) and by the Chancellor of the(Previous Exchequer (W.P. (G.) (40) 123) regarding the proposed purchaseEeferenee:        of additional quantities of foreign sugar to supplement the homeW.M. (39) 106th crop and supplies available from the Empire.Conclusions,Minute 4.) The Minister of Food said that, since his Memorandum hadbeen prepared, the position had deteriorated. The actual allocation to manufacturers on the basis of the agreed percentage of reduction was turning out to be higher than had previously been estimated.The allotment would amount to approximately an additional25,000 tons. Moreover, the prospective shortage in the british west Indies&apos; crop, which had been estimated in paragraph 4 ofhis Memorandum at 60,000 tons, would now, he understood, amountto 70,000 tons. He did not seek authority to replace this 70,000 tonsby purchases of foreign sugar, but he was alarmed at the prospect that stocks at the end of September would fall below the minimumsafety level (250,000 tons). He regarded it as inevitable that the domestic sugar ration should be reduced during the four summer months from 12 ounces to 8 ounces per week, but the first publicreactions to the indications he had given of an impending reductionhad been most unfavourable.Even with this reduction, which was estimated to save some91,000 tons, stocks would fall to the minimum safety level on acalculation which made no allowance for shipping losses or delays.He would welcome authority to purchase the 50,000 tons of foreignsugar for which he had asked. He expected to make a saving of between  150,000 to  200,000 on reduced purchases of foreign eggs and hoped that the exchange position would be improved by thesale in the United States of America of a quantity of surpluscocoa which, it had been stated, would otherwise be destroyed bythe producers. His purchases of sugar in the &quot; difficult &quot; currenciesamounted to only  400,000 as compared with  1,800,000 in the&apos;&apos; easy &apos;&apos; currencies.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had hoped thatthe position might be eased by the possible reduction of the rationto His Majesty&apos;s Forces and by a cut in the allotment to the brewers.He thought that there was some room for saving in the quantityof sugar allotted to the brewing industry, since his budget proposalsenvisaged a reduction in barrelage of some 15 per cent.; this, hethought, would enable the allotment of sugar to this industry, whichwas at present 30 per cent, below the pre-war level, to be reducedstill further.The Minister without Portfolio enquired whether a reducedconsumption of sugar could not be advocated in the interests of
Butter.(Previous&apos; Eef erence:W.M. (39) 63rdConclusions,Minute 10.)health in the course of the propaganda lectures on food valueswhich were now being given.The Minister of Food replied that this argument might beexpected to appeal to people who attended lectures, but would notpenetrate to manual labourers and others who were heavy consumersof sugar.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was bound tomaintain his objection to the use of our limited resources of foreign exchange for the purchase of sugar; he thought that this was oneof the last commodities for which we should use our supplies of&apos;&apos; hard &apos;&apos; currency.The Minister of Food said that in these circumstances hewould defer his proposal, if he might be allowed to raise the matter again at the end of two months, in the light of the situation atthat time; he was willing to take the risk of further deterioration of the position during that period, and was anxious to co-operate in conserving existing foreign exchange resources, if other means could be found to secure that stocks of sugar should not fall to a dangerous level in the autumn. He would now ask the War Cabinetto give him authority to reduce the sugar ration at once. He also asked for approval for the reduction of the domestic butter rationas from the following month.The War Cabinet agreed (1) To authorise the Minister of Food to reduce the domesticsugar ration as soon as possible from 12 ounces per week to 8 ounces per week.(2) To authorise the Minister of Food to reduce the domesticbutter ration from 8 ounces per week to 4 ounces perweek as from the beginning of June.(3) Not to authorise the proposed purchase of 50,000 tons offoreign sugar, it being understood, however, that itshould be open to the Minister of Food to bring thematter again before the War Cabinet, if he thought necessary, in two months&apos; time.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 8, 1940.
