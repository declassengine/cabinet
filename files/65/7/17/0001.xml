The western front.Progress of operations.(previous erence: .W.M. (40) 121stConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a message which he had received over the telephone from M. Reynaud and onwhich he had had some preliminary discussion with the Chiefs ofStaff.  The contents of the message were as follows : &quot; Germany intends to deliver a mortal blow towards Paris.The German Army has broken through our fortified line southof Sedan. The reason is that we cannot resist the combinedattacks of heavy tanks and bomber squadrons. To stop theGerman drive whilst there is still time and to allow ourcounter-attack to succeed, it is necessary to cut off the Germantanks and the bombers supporting them. It can only be doneby an enormous force of fighters. You were kind enough tosend 4 squadrons which is more than you promised, but if weare to win this battle, which might be decisive for the wholewar, it is necessary to send at once, if possible to-day, 10 moresquadrons. Without such support, we cannot be sure of stopping the German advance between Sedan and Paris.Between Sedan and Paris there are no fortifications left to be compared with the line to be re-established at almost any cost.&quot; I am confident that in this crisis English help will not fail us.&quot;Another message had been received by the Chief of the AirStaff from the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, British AirPorces in France. This telegram gave similar information as to the break in the French line, and added that General Gamelin andGeneral Georges took a serious view of the situation and had askedfor the maximum possible assistance. Arrangements had been madefor waves of French and British bombers to attack the roads and bridges leading to that particular part of the Front.It had also been learned that considerable troop-carryingaircraft traffic was taking place from a number of aerodromes inGermany.   The destination of the traffic was not known.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had spoken to General Gamelin on the telephone who had said that hewas much surprised at the rapid progress made by the enemy, and,in particular, at the manner in which they had succeeded in crossing the River Meuse and breaking through the main French positions.He thought it could only have been done with the help of amphibioustanks protected by armour impervious to the fire of the French tanks.He was moving an armoured division up to Rethel during the nightwith a view to delivering a counter-attack. The Chief of theImperial General Staff thought it unlikely that this counter-attackcould be ready by the next morning. The enemy were believed tohave one armoured division and one infantry division through the gap, but it had been thought earlier in the day that 12 german divisions were within a short distance of that front. The congestionon the roads and railways through the very difficult country behind the front of attack must be very great. There appeared, therefore,two requirements which air forces could fulfil. First, they couldcontinually bomb the roads and bridges over which the enemy mustpass to support the momentum of his attack. Secondly, they couldco-operate to give the counter-attack a chance of achieving success.It was for this task that the fighters would be required. Unless theGerman bombers could be kept back, the counter-attack would not get a proper chance to start.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said that he had just beentalking to the Commander-in-Chief, British Air Forces in France,who had said that he had already moved three fighter squadrons of the air component of the British Expeditionary Force down to operate on this front, thus making a total of six fighter squadronsavailable. He had said he was not pressed for fighters, but rather[212881 b 2
for medium bombers, which were all fully employed and which weresustaining heavy casualties. The Germans had built a number ofpontoon bridges across the Meuse, and three of these had alreadybeen broken by our air attack. The congested roads leading to thebridges were also being bombed. Thirty Blenheims from thiscountry had been despatched to continue the attack.In reply to an enquiry by the Secretary of State for War, theChief of the Air Staff said that all the French fighters which wereeffective were being employed. They had lost 83 since the beginningof the operations, the greater part of which had been destroyed onthe ground.The Prime Minister said that M. Reynaud had told him thatthe French were bringing back fighters from North Africa.M. Reynaud had said that his request for fighters had the authorityof Generals Gamelin and Georges. The French naturally had their whole attention fixed on the battle which was taking place on theirfront. He thought, however, that we should hesitate before wedenuded still further the heart of the Empire. A penetration of theline by mechanised units could not be decisive against a large armyunless heavily reinforced from the rear. The columns of motor vehicles would require petrol. The essential point was probably to support the coming counter-attack.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff agreed and said thathe hoped to know that night at what time the counter-attack wouldtake place. If necessary, one of the Chiefs of Staff could go over tosee General Gamelin.The Chief of the Air Staff said that no demand for additionalFighters had reached him through the normal channels. At thesame time, there was no reason to doubt M. Reynaud&apos;s statement that his request for 10 additional fighter squadrons had receivedthe approval of the French High Command, who would, of course,be glad to see this addition to the Allied air forces in France.Thirty-six heavy bombers would be leaving this country that night to bomb targets selected by the French Command, and it wasto be noted that these were in the Northern Sector. The fact thatthe French had not asked that these targets should be changed was perhaps an indication that they did not regard the situation in thesouth as being quite as desperate as was suggested by M. Reynaudin his message to the Prime Minister.Additional fighter squadrons for France could be drawn only from this country; and he was convinced that these squadrons would never return to this country once they were established on the other side of the Channel, as the majority of them would be lost.In the discussion which ensued it was agreed that the situation was too obscure to permit of a decision being taken at once. It wastherefore considered essential that information should be obtained at the earliest possible moment, not only about what had happened,but also regarding the future intentions of the French. assuming that a break through had occurred, it would be impossible for theFrench to mount and deliver a counter-attack on the following day,and there was, therefore, no question of an additional 10 fighter squadrons being required for operations immediately.The War Cabinet agreed (a) That the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should instructGeneral Swayne, Liaison Officer with General Georges,to return by air at the first possible moment that nightto report personally : (i) How the line had been broken.(ii) What was the present situation.(iii) What was the French plan to re-establish thesituation.
Air Policy.Action to betaken by thelong-range bombers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 120thConclusions,Minute 2.)Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 121stConclusions,Minute 14.)2. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute, the War Cabinet, again gave consideration to the actionwhich should be taken, in existing circumstances, by the long-rangebomber force. A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that two telegrams had been received that daythrowing light on the question whether Italy was likely to comeinto the war. The first, from our Naval Attache in Rome, had been dispatched at 5 a.m. that morning. This stated that merchantvessels were being assembled and armed at various ports, and thata boom was being placed across the harbour at Leghorn, and thatmines and net defences were being laid. The second telegram.No. 520 DIPP, was from our Ambassador in Rome, who said thathe had learnt from an entirely reliable source that a personage ofthe highest Fascist standing had quoted Signor Mussolini as havingcategorically declared that Italy would not go to war.The Foreign Secretary had spoken personally to Sir percy loraine over the telephone, who had said that the second telegram had been despatched in full knowledge of the first.Assuming Italy were to invade the Dalmatian Coast, theForeign Secretary was still in some doubt as to whether it wouldbe to our advantage to declare war. He was satisfied that it wouldbe Mussolini&apos;s desire that we should declare war, and we should therefore be playing into his hand if we were to do this. At thesame time there were obvious disadvantages in doing nothing. Hehad been looking for a middle course which might include suchaction as the withdrawal of our Ambassador, the closing of the suez Canal, the stoppage of Italian supplies. It was to beremembered, however, that any action of this character which wouldbe effective would have the result of rallying the Italian peoplebehind Signor Mussolini.The Prime Minister considered that the most prudent coursewould be to wait and see what action the Italians took and to take our decision in that light.The War Cabinet took note of this statement(&amp;) That the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should talk toGeneral Gamelin over the telephone, with a view to obtaining General Gamelin&apos;s appreciation of thesituation; and that, if necessary, a British Staff officers should fly over to Paris to see General Gamelin.(c) That the Chief of the Air Staff should immediately recallan Air Officer from France to report on the air situation.(d) That, meanwhile, the Chief of the Air Staff should take all necessary preparatory steps which would permit of theearly despatch of an additional 10 fighter squadrons toFrance if it should be decided to send further squadrons to. France.
Italy: possible 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked if the hostility. plan for the proposed seizure of an aerodrome and harbour in CreteSuggested Allied was ready.operations forseizure ofpositions inCrete.The Chief of Naval Staff explained that the plan envisageda combined operation by British and French forces. The Frenchproposed that they should supply the troops, and that we should provide the anti-aircraft guns and fighters. Certain misgivingshad been aroused by a report that the French were proposing toassume command of this operation. Our Naval Attache in Parishad, however, seen the French orders. These were drafted on theassumption that the French Admiral would be under the orders of Admiral Cunningham. A conference would be taking place inthe course of the next few days at Alexandria, which would be attended by Marshal Chakmak and by two French Admirals. TheChief of Naval Staff suggested that the Crete operation should bediscussed at this conference. As a preliminary to the conferenceat Alexandria, a telegram might now be despatched to the threeCommanders-in-Chief in the Mediterranean and Middle East,authorising them to go ahead with the planning of the operation.This arrangement would, however, be of no avail if the italians were to declare war against us within the next few days.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 14, 1940.
