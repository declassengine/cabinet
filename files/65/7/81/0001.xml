Ireland.defence negotiations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 182ndConclusions,Minute 1.)X1. The War Cabinet had before them the text of theMemorandum taken by the Minister of Health to Dublin on the26th June, 1940, embodying the proposals made by the lord president of the Council and approved by them on the 25th June.The Ministers discussions with Mr. de Valera, Mr. Lemass andMr. Aiken, on the evening of the 26th June and on the 27th Junewere summarised in telegram No. 65 from the United kingdom representative in Eire.The War Cabinet also had before them the text of a further memorandum which it was proposed should be communicated toMr. de Valera, setting on record certain modifications made in theMemorandum of the 26th June.The Lord President of the Council said that, as agreed at theMeeting of the War Cabinet when this matter had last beendiscussed, he had written to Lord Craigavon, indicating to him thenature of the plan outlined in the Memorandum which had been handed to Mr. de Valera. The reply received had been to the effectthat Lord Craigavon was shocked to learn that negotiations werebeing carried on behind Ulster&apos;s back. Such an accusation was,of course, entirely unjustified. All that the Government had donewas to enquire what would be the attitude of the Government of eire towards a certain plan. It had throughout been made clearthat it would be necessary to obtain the assent thereto of theGovernment of Northern Ireland.It was agreed that a reply should be sent to Lord Craigavonby the Lord President emphasising that Northern Ireland&apos;s position was entirely protected.In discussion, the view was generally expressed that there was little chance that the Eire Government would agree to the present plan, even with the modifications proposed. In theory it was perhaps rather objectionable to modify the scheme to the extentof not requiring a declaration of war by Eire; but in practice thescheme would still secure to us the facilities which we required toguard against a sudden attack. Nevertheless, it was agreed thatit would be right to make the further communication now proposed.The fact that we had been prepared to go so far in the negotiations would put us in a very strong position, e.g., in regard to opinion inthe United States of America.The Minister of Health said that he thought there was a minority in Mr. de Valera&apos;s Cabinet who would be ready for discussions on the basis of the plan outlined. The modificationsnow proposed in the plan would be helpful to this minority, buthe feared that it was unlikely to affect the majority view.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the despatch to Mr. de Valera of the further memorandum circulated to the War Cabinet.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to reply toLord Craigavon on the lines indicated in discussion at&quot;X.&quot;France. 2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatGeneral de General de Gaulle was giving a broadcast that evening. It wasGaulle. proposed that, either before or after his broadcast, a short statement should be made in regard to the recognition by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of General de Gaulle. A draft statement was submitted- by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
The War Cabinet agreed that the following statement should be made : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise General de gaulle as the Leader of all free Frenchmen, wherever they may be, who rally to him in support of the allied cause.&quot;Broadcasts by 3.   The War cabinet ministers.Invited the Lord President of the Council to broadcast on the evening of Sunday, the 30th June; and, subject toany developments in the meantime, invited the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to broadcast on a date a littlela,ter.Future WarCabinetBusiness.Morocco.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 185thConclusions,Minute 10.)Eeeognition ofCzechoslovakNationalCommittee.(previous reference erence:W.M. (39) 111thConclusions,Minute 13.)Propaganda inthe UnitedStates ofAmerica.4.   Reference was made to the following matters :-(1) A preliminary discussion took place on the proposals madeby the Minister of Information arising out of his visit to Morocco (W.P. (40) 226), and it was agreed that thismatter should be considered by the War Cabinet onMonday, the 1st July.(2) Recognition of Czechoslovak National Committee. TheForeign Secretary said that he would bring this question before the War Cabinet early in the ensuing week.(3) The Foreign Secretary said that the arrangements for propaganda in the United States of America had beenunder discussion by his Department and the Ministryof Information. Settlement of various difficulties was now in sight. He undertook to report to the WarCabinet the arrangements proposed.The view was generally expressed that the time had come when more active steps should be taken to make our pointof view more widely known in the United States ofAmerica and to counteract German propaganda.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 28, 1940.
