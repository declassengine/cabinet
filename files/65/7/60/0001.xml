^ \j -3453W.M. 165 (40).The PrimeMinistersMeeting withM. Reynaud,13th June, 1940.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 164thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet an account ofthe Meeting which he and the Foreign Secretary had had withM. Reynaud that afternoon at Tours. There had been considerablesigns of disorganisation, and refugees had been streaming throughthe town.   The Meeting had been held in a room in the prefecture.M. Reynaud had at first seemed very depressed. general weygand had reported to him that the French Armies wereexhausted. Their line was pierced in many places; refugees werepouring through the country; and many of the troops were considerably disordered. He felt that it was necessary to ask foran armistice while there were still enough French troops left tokeep order in the country until peace could be made. M. reynaud had said that the French had suffered as much as they could bearand had done their best as a loyal ally. He now asked whetherGreat Britain would release France from the pledge which she had made not to make a separate peace.In reply, he (the Prime Minister) had said that he felt onrather weak ground as we had so few troops taking part in the battle. We would have had fourteen divisions, but for reversesmet with as a result of applying an agreed strategy in the North.Nevertheless, we were determined to continue to give all the helpin our power, and believed that Hitler could not win the warwithout overcoming us. Our war aim still remained the total defeat of Hitler, and we felt that we could still bring this about. We were,therefore, not in a position to release France from her obligation.Whatever happened, we would level no reproaches or recriminationsat France; but that was a different matter from consenting to release her from her pledge.The discussion had then turned to the American situation.M. Re3maud&apos;s message of the 10th June, in which he had said that france would fight on even if it meant continuing the struggle from french Possessions in America, had just been published, andM. Reynaud was evidently much heartened by the fact that president Roosevelt had consented to this. He (the Prime Minister)said that the French must now send a new demand to president roosevelt, urging him to intervene. This appeal would be backedup from here by a statement of the position and a request forassistance to France. M. Reynaud agreed to do this and proposedto make an appeal for the maximum help which the President could give short of sending an expeditionary force.Matters were finally left that the French would hold on untilthe result of this final appeal was known.The meeting had then ended, and he had gone into anotherroom where he had seen a number of Ministers, including M. Herriotand M. Mandel. The&apos; former had shown himself resolutelydetermined to continue the struggle.Since returning to this country a further remarkable message had been received from President Roosevelt. The Prime Ministerthen read to the War Cabinet this message, a copy of which is appended to these Minutes (Annex I). This message, he said, cameas near as possible to a declaration of war and was probably asmuch as the President could do without Congress. The Presidentcould hardly urge the French to continue the struggle, and to undergo further torture, if he did not intend to enter the war tosupport them. If the President were not disavowed by his country,then it was clear that he would bring them in on our side inthe near future. This message would have been quite sufficient asan answer to M. Reynaud&apos;s final appeal, but it would be observedthat it had come in advance of it, which made the effect even morestriking.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he had little to add to the Prime Minister&apos;s account of the Meeting. Accordingto Sir R. Campbell, M. Reynaud had apparently been in a strongermood earlier in the day, and had recaptured that mood again[21411b] b 2
towards the end of the proceedings. In fact, the Meeting had ended in an atmosphere of resolution, and Sir R. Campbell had beensurprised by M. Herriots attitude. The main impression createdwas that although the French Armies might be nearly finishedfor effective and organised operations, it ought still to be possibleto get the French to play the part of Holland, rather than of denmark. He felt that they could be brought to see that if they made an armistice, they would embark on a slippery slope whichwould lead to the loss of their fleet, and eventually of their liberty.The Minister for Aircraft Production felt that M. reynaud had asked the Prime Minister to come over to relieve him from hisobligation and to agree to France making a separate peace. ThePrime Minister, however, by kindly firmness, had persuaded him toa more resolute course of action. The new message which had just arrived from President Roosevelt was a complete justification for the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister. It was nowinevitable that the United States of America would declare war.M. Reynaud would be content with the very big step forward whichhad already been taken by the President.The Minister for Information said that an awkward situation had arisen over the publication of M. Reynaud&apos;s message of the10th June. The American Press correspondents were anxious toknow what reply had been received to this message and appearedto think that the President&apos;s speech which had been delivered onthe same date should be taken as the reply. He had been unableto give them any information on this point, nor had he been ableto say whether the message had been published with the authorityof the President. If he could say this, the effect would undoubtedly be good and would indicate that the President had received the message favourably.Some discussion took place on this point and the foreign secretary pointed out that M. Reynaud had said that he had leave to publish the message, and was much heartened by that fact. Evenif it could not be said that the President had authorised publication,it could be suggested that the message could not have been publishedwithout the Presidents authority.Later in the meeting the Prime Minister left the room to seethe American Ambassador and on his return informed the WarCabinet that Mr. Kennedy was convinced that the President musthave authorised the publication of the message. The Virginiaspeech could not be taken as being the Presidents answer, since itwas delivered before the President had received the message. TheMinister of Information could therefore make these two facts clear to the Press.Some discussion followed on the precise interpretation whichcould be given to President Roosevelt&apos;s latest message. It waspointed out that he had not stated in terms that the United states would declare war. On the other hand, it was argued that no headof a State could send such a message to France, urging her tocontinue her agony, unless he was certain that his country was coming to her aid. M. Reynaud would surely be entitled to saythat France was going forward with the struggle in the sure andcertain hope of the full support of the United States.It was generally felt that, although the implications of the message might be clear to the Anglo-Saxon mind, they might appear in rather a different light to the French, who would be looking for something more definite. It would be necessary to point out tothem that the message contained two points which were tantamount to a declaration of war first, a promise of all material aid, whichimplied active assistance; and second, a call to go on fighting evenif the Government was driven right out of France.
The Prime Minister suggested that he should say toM. Reynaud that President Roosevelt&apos;s message fulfilled every hopeand could only mean that the United States intended to enter thewar on our side. If the French continued the struggle, Hitler would enter Paris within a day or so, but he would find the capital a mereempty shell. Though he might occupy much of her country, the soulof France would have gone beyond his reach. No doubt he would offer very specious terms to the French, but these we could not permitthem to accept. When Hitler found that he could get no peace inthis way, his only course would be to try and smash this island.He would probably make the attempt very quickly, perhaps withina fortnight; but before that the United States of America wouldbe in the war on our side.The Lord Privy Seal urged that a statement in dramatic terms should be issued to hearten the people of France. It was not enoughmerely to send messages of encouragement to the French Govern-ment.The Prime Minister said that he made it quite clear at themeeting that we should never desert France, and that, if we wonthrough, as we believed we should, the wrongs of France would berighted. We should fight on and never quit the struggle untilFrance had been fully restored.There was general agreement that an announcement in dramaticterms of the solidarity of France and Great Britain should be issued.We might say that &quot; France and Great Britain were one.&quot;Her Majesty the Queen might be invited to include thissentiment in her forthcoming broadcast to the women of France.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs then raised thequestion of the line we should take with Dominion Governments.He stressed that it was not enough to tell them all that had passed.They must be treated as full partners and their assent must not betaken for granted.The Prime Minister proposed tJhat we should communicate tothe Dominions our announcement to the French people on oursolidarity with them, and also the latest message which had beenreceived from President Roosevelt. We should then add that ithad always been our intention to fight on to the bitter end, and suggest that now was the time for Dominion Governments to makea similar declaration.The Prime Minister summarised the immediate action whichshould be taken as follows : (a) He would send a telegram to M. Reynaud making clearthat President roosevelt&apos;s message of the 13th June wasthe answer to M. Reynaud&apos;s appeal of the 10th June,and gave the latter the assurance of further support which he considered essential if France was to continuethe struggle. It was important to make clear toM. Reynaud the full implications of the Presidentsmessage as we understood it.(6) A statement should be issued, in the form of a message totJhe French Government from His Majesty&apos;s Government,proclaiming the indissoluble union of our two peoples and of our two Empires. This statement should be giventhe widest possible publicity,(e) He would send a telegram to President Roosevelt seekinghis consent to the publication of his last message, and supporting the further appeal made by M. Reynaud.(d) A telegram should be sent to the Dominions informing them of the position and asking them publicly to endorseour policy.
The Prime Minister then left the room to speak to the american ambassador. During his absence a summary of M. Reynaud&apos;broadcast appeal to President Roosevelt, as reported on the tape,was brought in and read.On his return, the Prime Minister said that Mr. Kennedy had spoken to the President, who was agreeable to publication of hismessage, but that Mr. Hull was opposed to it. The President had heard that the meeting at Tours had been very successful, and it seemed that he did not realise how critical the situation was.Mr. Kennedy had gone back to the American Embassy in order tocommunicate to the President a full account of the meeting, basedon notes supplied to him by the Prime Minister. He was thenreturning to No. 10, Downing Street.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the drafts ofthe following: (a) A telegram from himself to M. Reynaud.(b) The message to the French Government from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, proclaiming the indissoluble union of our two peoples and our two Empires.(c) A telegram from himself to President Roosevelt.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs read out the draftof a telegram to the Dominions.The texts of these documents were agreed. Copies of (a)and (b) are appended as Annexes II and III to these minutes.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 164thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Chief of the Air Staff said that there was nothing ofparticular interest to report in the day&apos;s operations. 160 bombers were out that night attacking the communications of the german army. There had been a complete change in the French attitudetowards operations against Italy and they had now consented toour operating from French aerodromes. The Servicing Units hadbeen ordered back to the base, but he could stop them and make them return to the aerodromes if the Cabinet would approve thiscourse of action.The War Cabinet agreed That the Royal Air Force Servicing Units should returnto French aerodromes so that air operations against targets in Italy could be resumed.The western front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 164thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that therewas no particular news from France. There were signs that aGerman attack was being planned across the Upper Rhine and it also seemed probable that the Germans would resume their advancesouth-eastwards from Rouen, though the French had some hopes of holding this back. The most dangerous movement appeared tobe the thrust towards Verdun, which, if successful, would turn theMaginot Line. In reply to an enquiry from the Foreign Secretary,he said that, although the enemy had thrown great numbers intothe battle and had lost heavily and were very exhausted, it wouldbe unwise to suppose that they had not got reserves for attackingthis country.
The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 164thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The First Sea Lord said that 15 Skuas had attacked enemy-warships at Trondhjem in the early morning. Unfortunately, foghad come down over the aircraft carrier at the time when theaircraft were returning. The result of this and of the anti-aircraft fire was that 8 Skuas had been lost, though it was possible thatsome of their crews had managed to get ashore. One hit had been observed on a battle cruiser just abaft the funnel, and there mighthave been other hits.H.M.S. Calypso, an old cruiser which had been on patrol north of Crete, had been torpedoed by an Italian submarine while on herway back to Egypt and. one officer and 38 men were missing.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Parliament. 5.   The Lord Privy Seal said that the position must be facedthat Paris might fall at any hour. If that happened, parliament would expect to be summoned, and informed as to the position.The War Cabinet agreed That, if Paris fell during, say, the next twenty-four hours,Parliament should be summoned for a short session on saturday morning.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 13, 1940.ANNEX I.Secret and Personal from the President to M. Reynaud., YOUR message of 10th June has moved me very deeply. As I havealready stated to you and to Mr. Churchill, this Government is doing everything in its power to make available to the Allied Governments the material they sourgently require, and our efforts to do still more are being redoubled. This is sobecause of our faith in and our support of the ideals for which the Allies are fighting.The magnificent resistance of the French and British armies has profoundlyimpressed the American people.I am, personally, particularly impressed by your declaration that France willcontinue to fight on behalf of Democracy, even if it means slow withdrawal, even to North Africa and the Atlantic. It is most important to remember that theFrench and British fleets continue mastery of the Atlantic and other oceans; alsoto remember that vital materials from the outside world are necessary to maintainall armies.I am also greatly heartened by what Prime Minister Churchill said a few daysago about the continued resistance of the British Empire, and that determina-tion would seem to apply equally to the great French Empire all over the world.Naval power in world affairs still carries the lessons of history, as admiral darlan well knows.June 13, 1940.
ANNEX II.Telegram to Tours, No.       (DIPP), June 13, 1940.Prime Minister to M. Reynaiiol.(Most Immediate.)      - 1ON returning here we received copy of President Roosevelt&apos;s answer to yourappeal of 10th June. Cabinet is united in considering this magnificentdocument as decisive in favour of the continued resistance of France inaccordance with your own declaration of 10th June about fighting beforeParis, behind Paris, in a Province or, if necessary, in Africa or across the atlantic. The promise of redoubled material aid is coupled with definite advice and exhortation to France to continue the struggle even under the grievousconditions which you mentioned. If France on this message of president roosevelt&apos;s continues in the field and in the war, we feel that the United states is committed beyond recall to take the only remaining step, namely, becoming a belligerent in form as she already has constituted herself in fact. Constitutionof United States makes it impossible, as you foresaw, for President to declare war himself, but, if you act on his reply now received, we sincerely believe thatthis must inevitably follow. We are asking President to allow publication ofmessage, but, even if he does not agree to this for a day or two, it is on the recordand can afford the basis for your action. I do beg you and your colleagues, whoseresolution we so much admired to-day, not to miss this sovereign opportunityof bringing about the world-wide oceanic and economic coalition which must be fatal to Nazi domination. We see before us a definite plan of campaign, and thelight which you spoke of shines at the end of the tunnel.ANNEX III.Message to the French Government from His Majesty&apos;s Government.IN this solemn hour for the British and French nations and for the causeof freedom and Democracy to which they have vowed themselves, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment desire to pay to the Government of the French Republic the tributewhich is due to the heroic fortitude and constancy of the French armies in battleagainst enormous odds. Their effort is worthy of the most glorious traditions of France and has inflicted deep and long-lasting injury upon the enemy&apos;sstrength. Great Britain will continue to give the utmost aid in her power. we take this opportunity of proclaiming the indissoluble union of our two peoples and of our two Empires. We cannot measure the various forms of tribulationwhich will fall upon our peoples in the near future. We are sure that the ordealby fire will only fuse them together into one unconquerable whole. We renewto the French Republic our pledge and resolve to continue the struggle at all costs in France, in this Island, upon the oceans, and in the air, wherever it may leadus, using all our resources to the utmost limit and sharing together the burdenof repairing the ravages of war. We shall never turn from the conflict untilFrance stands safe and erect in all her grandeur, until the wronged and enslavedStates and peoples have been liberated, and until civilisation is freed from thenightmare of Nazidom. That this day will dawn we are more sure than ever.It may dawn sooner than we now have the right to expect.June 13, 1940.
