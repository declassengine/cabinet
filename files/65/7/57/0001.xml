6 t; 0The western front.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 161stConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave thefollowing information to supplement that contained in the joint intelligence Sub-Committee&apos;s Summary (Special Report No. 23).The situation west of Rouen was very obscure, but two battalions of the 51st Division were known to have crossed the Seine to thesouth, where the Germans were being opposed by a weak brigade ofthe Armoured Division. The remnants of the Beauman Divisionwere also south of the Seine. Enemy pressure south of the riverdid not seem heavy.The situation of the remains of the 51st Division, which by now would comprise probably only two weak infantry brigades anddivisional troops, was critical. A signal which had just beenreceived from the Commander stated that he had been ordered bytlhe Commander of the French IX Corps to cease fire at 8 a.m. Hebad refused to comply until he had satisfied himself that evacuation by boat from the beaches was impossible, but the message endedby saying that he had now ordered the &quot; cease fire.&quot; It was known that the 51st Division had been very short of ammunition, petrol and food yesterday, and the fog last night had prevented evacuation from the St. Valery area.The general picture was certainly not promising. There were signs of a heavy German attack east of Rheirns. The French havingfallen back on to the Marne had opened up a line of advance forthe enemy on to Paris through Rheims and Meaux. There was now no water obstacle covering Paris on this side. Similarly onthe western side the enemy forces between the Seine and the Eurenow had a direct line of approach on to Paris, and his intentionprobably was to make a converging movement on the city. Germanadvanced elements must be expected in the capital within the next24 to 48 hours. The state of the defences of Paris was not known.Information was extremely difficult to obtain from France owing toG.Q.G. and the Government having been on the move. Three lightmechanised divisions of the French had been brought up on the left south of the Seine. The advance of the three other improvisedmechanised divisions which were to move up on to the right had been considerably hampered by bombing. It would take a considerable time for the French to make up further improvised formations fromtroops and equipment drawn from training establishments.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The air situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 161stConclusions,Minute 3.)Enemy activity.fighter command.bomber command.2. The Chief of the Air Staff said that there had been littleenemy activity in the previous twenty-four hours; but a number of enemy aircraft had been reported in the channel during the night,presumably mine laying. A considerable number of raids had beenreported moving down the coast of France.the French coast,formations.   one that morning an enemy bomber had been brought down atHerne Bay.168 sorties had been made by fighters overon offensive patrols, and as escorts for bomberHurricane was missing.  Reports showed that eight enemy aircraft,and possibly another three had been shot down.By day 51 medium bomber sorties had successfully attacked enemy concentrations in the Seine area. Direct hits had beenobtained on armoured fighting vehicles and motor transport columns,which were in some cases also machine gunned. Two enemy fighters were claimed to have been shot down. Three of our aircraft weremissing and two had crashed on landing-100 sorties had been made by heavy bombers during the night.The targets included forests on the Franco-Belgian frontier, road
British AirForces in,France.operations against NorthItaly.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 156thConclusions,Minute 4.)and rail crossings behind the front, and railway marshalling yardsin Germany. In addition, 5 aircraft had been engaged on minelaying. The operation planned against the Black Forest had notbeen carried out in view of bad weather conditions.24 day and 21 night sorties had been made by our bombers inFrance against enemy columns near the River Seine, and in theLaon area, against bridges over the Somme and on Trier aerodrome.Successful results were reported.   One of our aircraft was missing.77 Fighter sorties had been made, but few enemy aircraftencountered. None were shot down and none of ours were missing,though four had crashed without injury to the pilots.It had been arranged that 12 of our bombers should attacktargets in North Italy from the south of France and a further 36from this country. The latter had, as arranged, refuelled at theChannel Islands. When these aircraft were already in the air,Air Marshal Barratt had received a message from GeneralVuillemin asking him to call off the operation on t)he ground thatthe French Government objected. Air Marshal Barratt had repliedthat the operation had been agreed to by the Supreme War Council,that the aircraft were already in the air, and that in view of the lack of warning it would be impossible to comply with the french governments wishes. Air Marshal Barratt (had telephoned to major-General Ismay, and through him had received instructions from the Prime Minister that the operation was to be carried out.A protest had subsequently been received from the FrenchCommanding Officer in the South, and Air Marshal Barratt had again got in touch with Major-General Ismay, and had again received from the Prime Minister instructions to carry outthe operation. The twelve aircraft which should have taken off from French aerodromes had been prevented from doing so, aslorries had been driven across the airfield.The 36 aircraft which had refuelled at the Channel Islandshad been unfortunate, 14 of them had developed engine trouble andhad been forced to land in France, a most unusual occurrence. Inthis case the trouble appeared to have been due to petrol, and thoughit was possible that a bad consignment had been used, there was alsoa possibility of sabotage. The remaining 22 bombers had run intoappalling weather, and only five of them had reached their target,on which they had dropped their bombs, though no report of theresults had yet been received. All but four of the 36 aircraft were now accounted for, and it was not certain that all these four hadbeen lost. The majority were dispersed over France. One aircraft had definitely been lost.The decision of the Supreme War Council on this question was quite clear; while there might well be another explanation, theFrench action suggested that there might be an understanding between them and the Italians not to take offensive action againstone another.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Frenchaction might have been prompted by fear of reprisals.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Italians had carriedout an air raid on Malta at 0500&apos; hours on the 11th June, they had attacked at between 10,000 and 14,000 feet, and their objectivehad been the Dockyard and Hal Far aerodrome. The damage caused in this raid had been negligible; some vehicles on the aerodrome had been damaged. There had been 3 civilian and4 military casualties. In Shis raid one enemy aircraft, possiblytwo, had been brought down by anti-aircraft fire. Other enemy aircraft had flown over Malta during the day, probably onreconnaissance. In the evening, there had been a further raid by25 aircraft. The damage appeared to have been negligible. Oneraider had been brought down by anti-aircraft fire and one by aGladiator.
The Secretary of State for Air said that he had heard that the maltese had behaved with great calmness. The preparations againstparachutists had been excellent.Libya. The Chief of the Air Staff said that on the morning of thef 11th May 3 squadrons of Blenheims had attacked a large concen-tration of enemy aircraft on El Adam aerodrome, and one squadronhad attacked again in the afternoon. Petrol fires had been started and damage done to aircraft and hangars. It had been difficult to assess the damage owing to the dust caused by bursting bombs.Pighter opposition had been ineffectual. Three Blenheims had been lost, one of which had been seen to land at El Adam.Eritrea. Two squadrons of bombers had also attacked Italian aerodromes at Asmara in Eritrea. The attack was a surprise, and aircraft and hangars had been damaged. A squadron had attacked Massawalater in the day. No report had been received. One Wellesley wasmissing.Attack on A bombing attack had been made by 12 Hudsons of the Coastalwarships at Command against enemy warships in Trondhjem harbour. AttacksTrondhjem.       had been made from 15,000 feet, and 3 direct hits with 250-lb. S.A.P.bombs had been made on two enemy cruisers. A merchant ship had also been hit. Two Hudsons had been lost one by fighters, theother by anti-aircraft fire.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had recently seen President Hambro. He would send an account of thisinterview to the Secretary of State for Air. President Hambro saidthat we should not allow the Germans in South Norway to remainundisturbed, as it was probable that they would attempt to organisean invasion of Great Britain from Norway. The Norwegians made no complaint of our raids; indeed, the complaint of the Oslo council was that Oslo was not being bombed enough.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 161stConclusions,Minute 5.)Malta,Narvik convoys.naval co-operation onthe western front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 161stConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The First Sea Lord said that H.M.S. Diamond had attacked a submarine off Malta, but no success had been claimed.An Italian ship had tried to scuttle herself in order to block the harbour at Malta, but the attempt had been unsuccessful and theship had been beached.Nine more Italian ships had been captured, and 7 had scuttledthemselves. Two Italian ships which had left Durban on theprevious day and had tried to scuttle themselves had been beachedsuccessfully.The first echelon from Narvik had reached the Clyde and thesecond echelon was now in the Minches. Lord Cork, with general auchinleck and the Headquarters Staff, were arriving at noon.A Stockholm report stated that the armed merchant cruiserVandyke had been sunk off Harstad on the 10th June. This ship had been sent as an additional transport to pick up Norwegiantroops, but was empty at the time of the attack. She had probably been torpedoed.Destroyers had been co-operating with the 51st Division duringthe morning by bombardment, but these operations would presumably now have been called off if the remnants of the division hand surrendered. HALS. Calcutta had been standing by in Doverto assist in the same operation.In connection with the air attack on targets in North Italy (see minute 2), the First Sea Lord said that it had been agreed that,while we should take on the air bombardment of targets in northern italy, the French were to carry out a plan which they had alreadyprepared for sea attack on targets in the same area.
That morning, however, the French Naval Liaison Officer had informed the Admiralty that the French High Command haddefinitely forbidden the carrying out of the operation by french naval forces.No news had been received of any Italian action against theFleet in the Mediterranean. The Commander-in-Chief had notbroken wireless silence.Details of Fleet dispositions and operations proposed whichwere given to the War Cabinet are contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The UnitedStates ofAmerica.Production of aircraft engines.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 149thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Washington telegram No. 190 PURCO, dated the 11th June,reporting that Mr. Ford had made a proposal to the United states administration to make Rolls-Royce aeroplane engines withoutprofit. He expected to be in production in a month and to achieve a maximum output of 40 per day (working two shifts) in fromtwelve to fourteen months.Mr. Morgenthau had asked that the Allied Governments should immediately join with the United States Administration in placingan order with Mr. Ford for 10,000 Merlin engines. This offer was now under consideration by the Minister for Aircraft Production.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Tokyo telegram No. 975, dated the 11th June, stating that,agreement having now been secured on all points, Sir robert craigie proposed to initial the Tientsin memoranda at 4 p.m(Tokyo time) that day. Sir Robert had gone on to say that it was important, in order that there should be no chance of mistake, thatno announcement of any kind should be made until the date (a weekhence) when covering notes were to be exchanged.So far as it went this news was all to the good. It was satis-factory that the Tientsin agreement should have been arrived atwith the knowledge and consent of the Chungking Government.In addition, the Japanese Ambassador in London had madea favourable impression in a conversation which he (had had theprevious day with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Egypt- 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had telegraphed to His(Previous Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo (No. 443 DIPP) on the lines agreedEef erence:        at the previous day&apos;s meeting of the War Cabinet.   This telegramW.M. (40) 161st had crossed one from Sir Miles Lampson (No. 491 DIPP) sayingConclusions,      that, after a further interview with the Egyptian Prime Minister,Minute 7.)        he was far from happy as to his good faith.   Sir Miles thoughtthat we might have to insist upon the formation of a broaderGovernment under some Prime Minister prepared to stand by usloyally, and to take a definitely strong hand towards Italy.   TheKing would certainly object;, but we should be prepared in case of need to face that, and tell him he must comply or get out.The Foreign Secretary added that he had seen a newspaperreport, which he was not yet in a position to confirm, to the effectthat the Egyptian Parliament had the previous night decided tobreak off relations with Italy.Japan.Settlement ofthe Tientsinquestion.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 79thConclusions,Minute 5.)
7. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to Stockholmtelegram No. 684, dated the 10th June, containing information which was said to come &quot; from an absolutely reliable neutral sourcerecently in Berlin and in touch with official circles there.&quot; It was said that continuous bombing in the Ruhr was having a moral effecton the workers, whose sleep was much curtailed. Five hundredcasualties were rumoured in an ammunition factory. In spite of order for bell ringing last week, there were no signs of publicrejoicing. The absence of news about casualties was causinganxiety. One soldier, returned from the Belgian front, estimated150,000 German dead.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Abyssinia. g    ^he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, athis request, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State had seen the Emperor of Abyssinia on the previous day, partly with theobjept of discovering whether the Emperor could suggest ways inwhich we could make trouble for the Italians in Abyssinia. In replyto a question, the Foreign Secretary said that he doubted whetherit would be wise for the Emperor to return to Abyssinia, since someof the tribesmen regarded him as having let them down.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Plans to meet aCertainEventuality.(previous reference:9. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff Committee recommending that plans should be preparedfor a number of measures to be taken to meet a certain eventuality(W.P. (40) 201).A record of the discussion which took place, and of theW.M. (40) 141st conclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard FileConclusions,      0f War Cabinet Conclusions.Minute 9.)strategic importance ofthe channel islands.10. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff Committee on the strategic importance of the channel islands (W.P. (40) 197).The Chief of the A ir Staff explained that, although the channel islands had no great strategical importance, the Chiefs of Staffconsidered that a certain measure of defence should be provided forthe two main islands, and therefore had taken steps to sendimmediately one battalion to Guernsey and one to Jersey. Theyhad arranged for the Prime Minister to be informed of thisproposal, but there had not been time to get his formal approval.The Chiefs of Staff had, however, acted in anticipation of it.The Minister of Home Security said that he would like toconsider, as suggested in paragraph 17 of the Report, whetherfacilities should be offered for the evacuation of women and children from the islands on a voluntary and free basis. As a first step, hewould consult the Lieutenant-Governors. At first sight he was inclined to think that the true inhabitants of the islands would not take advantage of such an offer, and that the well-to-do settlerscould afford to make their own arrangements to leave if they wishedto do so. If there should be a desire on behalf of the islanders tobe evacuated, the matter was one to be organised by the islandauthorities.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.(2) Gave covering aporoval to the orders already given for thedespatch of ons battalion to Guernsey and one to Jersey.Effect of Britishbombing.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 131stConclusions,Minute 8.)
(3) Agreed that, when these battalions had been established, alltraining establishments should be withdrawn from the islands.(4) Invited the Minister of Home Security, in consultation,as might be necessary, with the Service Departments,to initiate preparations for the destruction of allfacilities in the islands which might be of value to theenemy.(5) Took note that the Minister of Home Security proposed to consult the Lieutenant-Governors as to the provision of facilities for the evacuation of women and children fromthe islands.Invasion of 11.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theGreat Britain. Minister of Information (W.P. (40) 199).Campaign to The  Minister  of  Information  explained  that  the  leafletprepare public attached to the Memorandum had been compiled by his Departmentopinion. in conjunction with the War Office and the Ministry of Home(Previous Security, but that it did not represent complete agreement.   the reference: Ministry of Information would prefer the  deletion of para-W.M. (40) 154th graph VII of the draft, and were also a little doubtful aboutConclusions, paragraph VI.Minute 11.) The following were the main points made in discussion : Rule (1). The wording of this Rule could not finally besettled until it had been decided whether a 60 per cent, evacua-tion should take place from certain coastal towns.In this connexion the War Cabinet were informed that aMemorandum had been prepared in the Home Office, which took the view that the public in certain areas should be told now that, if their presence was not essential, it would not beregarded as unpatriotic if they were to remove themselves. If,on the other hand, they were involved in work of national importance, they should remain until they received orders to evacuate.The wording of the last sentence of the paragraph afterRule (1) should be amplified by specifying the danger to whichpeople would expose themselves if they tried to evacuate when an invasion was taking place.Rules (5), (6) and (7). All these three Rules, to a greater or less degree, raised the question whether the leaflet enjoined,or could be represented as enjoining, on civilians, action whichwould enable the enemy to say that we were encouraging the civilian population to act as francs-francs-tireurs, and thus be usedto justify reprisals.The view generally expressed was that Rule (5) was not open to this objection. There could be nothing wrong incivilians helping to block roads under the orders of the Military.Rule (6). It was pointed out that this Rule enjoinedorganising factories, works, &amp;c, for defence. Was such actionpermissible to civilians?The Minister of Home Security said that he was advised thatthere was a clear distinction between defence measures, taken inadvance of invasion, which were perfectly legitimate, and actionstaken by civilians after the enemy were in effective control of an area, which were not legitimate. He was also advised that action by the civilian population against individual parachutists and members of the Fifth Column was legitimate.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that it might be better that thedirection to organise the defence of factories, works, &amp;c, should begiven individually by the local Commanders to the responsible heads.
of factories and organisations, rather than in a leaflet for thegeneral population.The Minister of Home Security thought that, on balance, it was better that the workers should know that the steps taken to organise the defence of factories and works had the full approval of theGovernment.The Minister without Portfolio pointed out that the sentence :&apos;&apos; If you are a worker, make sure that the organisation is planned and understood,&quot; was not altogether consistent with the previoussentence.It was agreed that this sentence should be amended. It wasalso agreed that the word &quot; now &quot; should be inserted before&apos;&apos; organise &apos;&apos; in Rule (6).The general view of the War Cabinet was in favour of theretention of Rule 6, subject to amendment.Rule (7). The view generally expressed was that this rule should be omitted as unsuitable for incorporation in a document of this character, and that other means should befound for arranging harassing tactics.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Information to prepare a revised draft of the leaflet, in the light of the discussion, and tosubmit it to the War Cabinet.Invasion of 12.   The Lord President of the Council said that some concernGreat Britain. had been expressed as to the danger of damage to reservoirs and to protection of pipe-lines in the country. He would therefore be glad if thereservoirs. question could be brought to the notice of the Commander-in-Chief,Home Forces, with a view to the preparation of a report on the steps which were being taken to guard against such dangers.The Secretary of State for the Home Department said that thiswas part of the problem of vulnerable points which was engagingthe attention of the Home Defence Executive at the present time.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Ministerial 13.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the broadcasts. Minister of Information (W.P. (G.) (40) 146) proposing that theresponsibility for co-ordinating the arrangements for Ministerialbroadcasts should rest with the Minister of Information.The War Cabinet approved the suggestion that theMinister of Information should in future be responsiblefor the co-ordination of the arrangements for Ministerialbroadcasts.Egyptian 14.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that itCotton. was a matter of some urgency to allay the fears of the Egyptian(Previous cotton-growers that, owing to the Mediterranean situation, theyReference: would be unable to sell their cotton, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at\\-M. (40) 62nd Cairo had asked that early action should be taken to counteractConclusions, hostile propaganda which might represent that the economicMmute 2.) difficulties of the cultivators were due to Egypt&apos;s alliance with theBritish.
Discussions had taken place with representatives of theTreasury and of the Ministry of Supply and a suggestion had beenconsidered that a delegation should be sent out from the UnitedKingdom to study the question, with a view to making purchases of the cotton crop, if necessary, so as to ensure to growers in Egypta fair price for their product. It was hoped that it might bepossible to secure the services of Sir Ronald Lindsay, who had dealtwith the matter in the last war. The sum involved in the purchaseof the whole crop would be in the neighbourhood of  25 to 30 million. The first step in any scheme must clearly be for the suggested delegation to go out and report on the situation. TheForeign Secretary suggested that, in the meantime, a telegram should be sent to Sir Miles Lampson in the following terms : &quot; In view of Italy&apos;s entry into the war, you may inform theEgyptian Government that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill take steps to ensure to growers in Egypt a fair price for their cotton and cotton seed, and will, if necessary,make extensive purchases themselves.&quot;It was proposed at the same time to inform His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington, for the information of the UnitedStates Government, of the action proposed, but it was not antici-pated that they would raise any objection, as the cotton produced in America was not in competition with Egyptian cotton.General agreement was expressed with the proposal to telegraph to Sir Miles Lampson in the terms proposed by theForeign Secretary. The President of the Board of Trade suggestedthat a sentence should be added to the telegram asking that the egyptians might be invited to increase their purchase of british goods to replace the goods which had been previously imported from italy.The Minister of Economic Warfare concurred in the proposal.Sir Ronald Lindsay was giving him valuable advice on Americanaffairs, but he would be prepared to release him for this delegation,which he hoped would be of a temporary nature.The War Cabinet-(a) Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to despatch a telegram to Sir Miles Lampson in the terms proposed, with the addition of words to the effectsuggested by the President of the Board of Trade at&quot; A &quot; above.(b) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with other Ministers concerned^(i) to make arrangements for the appointment of theproposed delegation;(ii) to settle their terms of reference.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,June 12, 1940.
