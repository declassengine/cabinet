The Chief of the Air Staff said that there had been noSituation. activity over England or near the English coast until late the(Previous previous evening, when one raid had approached Beachy Head and reference:        passed to the south.   A number of raids had been plotted off theW.M.

In addition it was reported that our fighter squadrons in france had destroyed 2 enemy aircraft.  We had had no casualties.There had been no bomber sorties during the day. During theprevious night, 145 aircraft had attacked oil targets andmarshalling yards in the Ruhr areas and elsewhere in western germany. In addition mines had been laid in the Rhine and in theElbe Estuary. Of the 145 aircraft, 6 had returned early throughengine trouble and 2 had been lost. Detailed results of these attacks had not yet become available, but reports so far received were good.Of the fighter squadrons which had remained in France, it was intended that two should operate from the Channel Islands forpatrols in the Cherbourg area while the other three would operate,if possible, from Nantes until all evacuation had ceased. these aircraft would then be flown back to the United Kingdom and civil aircraft were standing by to bring back the last 150 ground staff.On the night of 16th-17th June, six aircraft operating froma base in France had successfully attacked aircraft factories atMilan and Genoa. Incendiary bombs had been dropped on the targets, and subsequent aircraft reported the wooden buildings ofthe Breda aircraft works at Milan to be burning furiously. Theaircraft carrying out these raids had returned to England, and orders had been issued that stores, ground personnel and anti-aircraft guns were to be loaded in 13 British merchant ships atMarseilles. It was hoped that these ships would be able to worktheir way to Gibraltar through Spanish territorial waters.Eighteen aircraft left at 0800 hours on the 17th June to attackenemy warships at Trondhjem, but weather had prevented the taskbeing completed.  Minelaying had been carried out in the FlushingOne aircraft had attacked 6 stationary destroyers off Nordeneyduring the night the 17th-18th June and had registered one direct hit.There had been several enemy raids on Malta during the16th June with small success. Some of the aircraft were German,but from their behaviour it was thought that the pilots wereItalian.RAP. reinforcements consisting of 20 aircraft had leftEngland the previous day to fly through France for Malta and egypt. It had been decided to take a chance of their gettingthrough.There had been various successful attacks on Tobruk and otherItalian targets in Egypt and the Sudan. On the 16th June, SouthAfrican bomber aircraft from Kenya had attacked ground targetswith considerable success.There had been enemy attacks on bases in Egypt during the16th and the 17th June, when a few Egyptian soldiers had becomecasualties.Weather had prevented air operations over Aden.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention toa statement contained in an Intelligence Report,* dated the17th June, that information was lacking regarding the situation at Stettin and other Baltic ports where seaborne expeditions could* J.I.C, Report No. 42.coastal command.Middle East.[21432]
at present be prepared in complete secrecy, and asked if any steps could be taken to carry out reconnaissance over these ports. Theabsence of such information was very disturbing.The Chief of the Air Staff said that long-range fighters wouldbe sent to obtain photographic information of the situation atStettin and other Baltic ports.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs drew attention toreports that aircraft had flown over this country in the direction ofIreland, and asked whether such aircraft would be detected on their return journey, or whether, in the absence of any definite informa-tion, it could be assumed that they had landed and remained inIreland.The Chief of the Air Staff said that it was by no means certainthat aircraft passing over this country would be detected again onthe return journey.The Lord President of the Council said that he thought thatMr. de Valera should be told that the inference was that the aircraft had landed in Ireland, and that there was no evidence that theyhad returned.The Chief of the Air Staff said that he had received reports from Polish sources that General Sikorski was somewhere in France,probably in the Nancy area. The Poles were very anxious that heshould be brought over to this country. He had accordinglyarranged to send a machine to Bordeaux with General Sikorski&apos;personal adviser on board, with instructions to find the General, ifpossible, and to bring him back to this country.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatevacuation was being carried out from Cherbourg, Brest, St. Maloand St. Nazaire. The numbers so far reported as having arrived in England were as follows :- Fit (mostly base details) ......    41,770Wounded................        732W.M. (40) 170th Guns        ...       ......       ...... 71Conclusions, Vehicles  &apos;...      ...       ...      ...      ...        595Minute 2.) -there were many more troops en route from France, and itwas hoped to continue evacuation from Cherbourg that day andpossibly the following day. All personnel had been cleared fromBrest, where considerable quantities of stores had been left behind.Evacuation had not so far been seriously interfered with except at St. Nazaire, which had been continuously bombed on the17th June.A destroyer had been sent to Nantes to take off General Brookewho had been instructed to go to Brest and arrange, if possible, forthe embarkation of any Chasseurs Alpins, Foreign Legionaries,Poles or Czechs that were willing to come off.The Secretary of State for War said that a letter had beenreceived from M. Benes to the effect that there were 12,000 czech troops in the South of France who wished to be taken out throughMarseilles. This would be difficult to arrange, but he would look into the question with the Admiralty.The western front.Evacuation ofthe B.E.F.(previous reference erence:

The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff informed the War Cabinetthat the First Lord of the Admiralty, accompanied by the Chiefof Naval Staff, had gone to Bordeaux in order to discuss with admiral Darlan, in person, the question of the future of the french fleet.Information had been received that the French Admiral at dakar had expressed his intention of continuing the fight, with theFrench Naval Forces at his disposal, whatever orders he might receive.Enemy attacks on shipping.Mediterranean.The French Admiral in Command at Cherbourg had stated his intention, if need be, of sailing with the ships under his commandto England. It had been hoped that it would be possible to hold the situation at Cherbourg until Friday, but the latest reportsindicated that Allied forces would not be able to remain beyondthe coming night. The harbour could not be blocked, but demolitionparties were present to destroy port equipment, and had orders toremain until they had completed their work, even at the risk ofcapture.   The French here were co-operating well.The position at other French ports was as follows : Saint Nazaire.It was hoped that the embarkation of all troops would becompleted by that afternoon. A good deal of mechanical transport had been taken off.Brest.All British personnel had been embarked on the previous night, but very little mechanical transport had been taken away.Bordeaux.Plenty of shipping was available. A number of parties were being taken off including parties of British, Belgian and polish refugees. These parties consisted of selected personnel,and not haphazard refugees.Le Havre.This was in German hands. The French had refused toallow us to carry out demolitions and had even gone to thelengths of removing the charges, after they had been placed byBritish parties.S.S. Lancastria (16,243 tons) had been bombed and sunk inthe Loire at 4 p.m. on the 17th. She had had 3,000 troops on board at the time, but it had not yet been possible to assess the casualties.Survivors had been transferred to the Oronsay.The Oronsay had herself been bombed and hit previous to this,but had left for Plymouth on the previous evening.H.M.S. Westcott had been in collision with S.S. Nyroca at p.m. on the 17th. She had been holed and could not steam atmore than 8 knots.During the operations, in which, however, she had not been taking part, the French liner Champlain (28,144 tons) had been sunk by a mine or torpedo off the entrance to La Pallice at 9-45 a.m.on the 17th.A report had been received that four enemy light aircraft had been seen North-East of Cyprus at noon on the 17th. forces had been despatched to intercept them, but they might be Frenchvessels.[21432] b 3
H.M.S. Diamond had contacted a submarine off Malta harbourearly on the morning of the 17th and had dropped deptlh charges.It was considered that the attack had been successful.Narvik convoy. The last store convoy from Narvik, consisting of 9 ships withan escort of 7, had arrived in the Clyde.North Sea. An air reconnaissance report received on the previous eveninghad stated that 6 German destroyers had been sighted off Norderney,and another had reported 40 ships South of Borkum. The accuracy of this second report was doubted. Further reconnaissances hadbeen sent out.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Proposed 4.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs informed the seizure of War Cabinet that four Swedish destroyers had left Eire for theSwedish Faroe Islands.  He suggested that consideration should be given toDestroyers. the possibility that they might be seized on their arrival there.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to look into this question.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of the War Cabinet to telegram No.&apos; 351 DIPP fromSir Samuel Hoare at Madrid asking what line he should take ifconfronted with a demand from the Spanish Government at gibraltar. The Foreign Secretary had in mind to reply to theW.M. (40) 164th foll^ing effect:-Conclusions, &quot; (i) If you receive such a demand, you should reply that the minute 10.) matter is one on which you must refer for instructionsto your Government.(ii) The lines on which we should in fact be disposed to take in replying to such a demand would be : (a) for reasons which the Spanish Government willreadily understand, we cannot discuss this matterduring the war;(b) we should be prepared to discuss this or any otherquestion of common interest after the conclusionsof hostilities;(c) this  and other matters  would  be  discussed asprimarily, if not exclusively, concerning ourselves and Spain.(iii) I should be glad of your comments.&quot;It was pointed out in discussion that, although Gibraltar was probably far less valuable than in the past owing to the developmentof air power, it was undesirable to commit ourselves to the discussionof this specific Spanish claim after the war. But there would be ,, no harm in saying that we should be ready after the war to discuss^ any matter of common interest to Spain and ourselves (without,however, referring specifically to Gibraltar).General agreement was expressed with this view.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to sendinstructions to Sir Samuel Hoare on the lines of his draft reply, subject to (ii) (a) and (b) being modified on the lines suggested at &quot;X.&quot;Spain.Question of gibraltar.(previous reference:
U.S.S.R. 6.   The Lord President of the Council drew the attention of(Previous the War Cabinet to telegram No. 335 DIPP of the 18h June from reference:        Sir Stafford Cripps.   Sir Stafford Cripps said that &quot;with everyW.M. (40) 167th hour that passes if is becoming more unlikely that the SovietConclusions,      Government will abandon their present attitude of reluctance to minute 11.)       acquiesce in a German hegemony of Europe.&quot;   He went on to saythat &quot; the one consideration which might induce them to make a stand at this late hour would be some assurance of Americancollaboration.&quot;  These statements did not seem altogether consistent.In any case, he saw no prospect of &quot; drawing the Soviet Union intoa common front against Germany.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wasnot quite clear what was in Sir Stafford Cripps&apos; mind. He had,however, sent a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador titWashington urging him to put before the United States Governmentthe possibility that they might be able to induce the Soviet Govern-ment to take a more positive attitude. Mr. Cordell Hull mightbe asked to drop a hint to the Soviet Ambassador that the UnitedStates Government were very much interested in restoring a stateof equilibrium in Europe. He had also discussed the matter withthe United States Ambassador in London, who had said that thecontrol of the supply of machine tools was the only means thatoccurred to him by which the United States of America could exertpressure on the Soviet Government. The Poreign Secretary hadnot encouraged Mr. Kennedy to pursue this line in view of our ownneed of American machine tools.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Belgium.   , 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to thePolicy of the War Cabinet telegram No. 146 DIPP, which had just been receivediBelgian Govern- from Sir R. Campbell at Bordeaux, reporting that the Belgianment in regard Minister of Public Health had said that the Belgian Governmentto continuing had now decided not to continue the struggle and that he alone hadthe war. opposed this decision.   We should, of course, continue our efforts(Previous to persuade the Belgian Government to come to this country and to reference:        continue the struggle from here.   If it were true that they had.M. (40) 154th decided irrevocably against this course, the matter was of someConclusions,      importance from the point of view of the Belgian Congo.;Minute 8.) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that a message had been received from General Smuts to the effect that hewas anxious in regard to the position in the Congo. It was pointedout, however, that, whatever decision might be reached by theBelgian Government, it was from the military point of view fareasier for us than for the Germans or Italians to control that territory. ........The War Cabinet took note of this statement.United States of        8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to aAmerica. suggestion which had reached him from Geneva that Her MajestySuggested The Queen should address an appeal to the people of the Unitedappeal by Her States for American assistance.   He himself did not recommendMajesty the this suggestion.Queen-    &quot; The War Cabinet-Expressed their agreement with the Foreign Secretary&apos;view on this matter.
9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested thatduring the coming critical forty-eight hours it would be of great assistance to our Ambassador in France, in his dealings with theFrench Government, that he should have the support at Bordeauxof a British Minister who could, if necessary, represent with authority the views of the British War Cabinet. He suggested thatthe First Lord of the Admiralty might remain on at Bordeaux after his interview with Admiral Darlan.The War Cabinet approved this proposal, and invited theAdmiralty to send a signal forthwith to the First Lord ofthe Admiralty at Bordeaux, conveying a request from theWar Cabinet that he should continue to remain at that place in touch with the French Government, until thesituation became more clear.France.Telegram fromthe PrimeMinister to marshal Petain.Suggestedmessage to theFrenchPresident.10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thePrime Minister had decided on the previous evening to send to marshal Petain a strongly-worded message stressing the injurywhich France would do if she handed over her Fleet to Germany(telegram No. 397 to Bordeaux).The Prime Minister had also asked the Foreign Secretary atthe same time to consider whether it would be desirable to proposeto His Majesty The King that he should send a short simplemessage to President Lebrun. He (the Foreign Secretary), havingconsidered the matter, was not in favour of suggesting the despatchof such a message.The War Cabinet agreed with this view.France.Suggestedbroadcast byGeneral de gaulle.11. The Minister of Information said that General de gaulle had communicated to him the text of a broadcast which he wishedto make saying that France was not defeated and inviting all french soldiers to rally to him.*The  War  Cabinet  agreedobjection  to the  substancethat, while there was noof the broadcast, it was undesirable that General de Gaulle, as persona non gratato the present French Government, should broadcast atthe present time, so long as it was still possible that theFrench Government would act in a way conformable to theinterests of the Alliance.France.Shipping bound for France orFrenchColonies.12. The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said that the admiralty had issued instructions to British vessels to inform all Frenchmerchant vessels at sea that they should proceed to the nearestBritish port.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the WarCabinet that, on the authority of the Prime Minister, instructions had been given on the previous evening to detain in British ports,until the situation should become clearer, shipping and suppliesen route to France or the French Colonies. If the presentindeterminate position continued, this might lead to congestion inour ports and other difficulties. He therefore proposed that officials of the Departments primarily concerned should meet as a matterof urgency to ascertain the facts of the position and to report whether there were any questions of policy requiring a decision.* The members of the War Cabinet were subsequently consulted againindividually on this question and it was agreed that General de Gaulle shouldbe allowed to broadcast, which he accordingly did the same evening.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 170thConclusions,Minute 4.)Presence of aBritishMinister atBordeaux.
511 W.M. 171(40).The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toarrange for a meeting of officials to examine the positionresulting from the hold-up of shipping and suppliesen route to France and the French Colonies and to reportany matters requiring decision by the War Cabinet.France. 13.   The Minister of Supply said that the shipment of materialSupplies manu- from this country to France had been stopped. He asked instruc-factured in this tions as to whether his Department should continue the manufacturecountry. of material ordered by the French Government which was notrequired by this country.The War Cabinet agreed That steps should be taken to discontinue the manufactureof supplies ordered by the French Government which we did not require for our own purposes.Scandinavia.Trade withKirkenes andPetsamo.14. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of supply on Trade with Kirkenes and Petsamo (W.P. (G.) (40) 151).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that all he required in regard to trade with Kirkenes was that the matter should be discussed inter-Departmentally. As regards Petsamo, itwas clear that we ought, if possible, to bring away the special steelsavailable at or en route to this port, as well as the Naval and AirForce personnel. The question turned on the ability of theAdmiralty to provide the necessary escort. He asked whether,failing an escort, the ships could be sent by some circuitous route.The Vice-Chief of the Naval Staff said that the enemy wouldhear when these ships sailed, and protection would have to beprovided. Now that the enemy was established in Northern Norwayin considerable force, it would be necessary to send a heavy escort,probably including a capital ship. Further, a good deal would turn on the date on which the escort would be required.The Minister of Supply said that the material in question would be of great value to the Ministry, both intrinsically and to fill a gap until supplies became available from the U.S.A.Clearly, however, the question turned on whether the admiralty could provide an escort.The War Cabinet-Invited the Admiralty  to consider  the feasibility ofproviding a suitable escort for two or three ships fromPetsamo, and to communicate with the Minister of Supply.Abyssinia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 163rdConclusions,Minute 7.)15. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 206).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention tothe recommendations in his Paper, namely, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should -(i) co-operate with the Emperor of Abyssinia and facilitatehis return to that country;(ii) issue a declaration reserving His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsright to full liberty of action in respect of undertakings given by them in the past to the Italian Government
concerning the Mediterranean, North or East Africa,and Middle Eastern areas, but not specifically men-tioning Abyssinia;(iii) take all possible steps to foment anti-Italian action on thepart of the peoples of Abyssinia.The Secretary of State for War said that, although the WarOffice had at first been opposed to the Emperor&apos;s return toAbyssinia, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in the middle east had recommended that facilities should be given for his return.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals contained in the Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as summarised above.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,June 18. 1940.
