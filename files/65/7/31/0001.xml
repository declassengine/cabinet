WAR CABINET 136 (40).The Western The Prime Minister said that he had been giving furtherFront- consideration to the observations made by the Lord Privy Seal that progress of morning on the danger of falling between two stools, and that itoperations. might be best for the B.E.F. to fall back on the Channel Ports. He(Previous had spoken to M. Reynaud and had told him that the position ofReference: the B.E.F. was very difficult. M. Reynaud had replied that theW.M. (40) 135th French operations were continuing. He had then spoken to general conclusions, Weygand at 6 p.m., and General Weygand had also had a conver-Minute 1.)        sation Avith the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.   The gist ofthe latter conversation had been summarised by the Chief of theImperial General Staff as follows : (1) He (General Weygand) had taken Amiens, Albert andPeronne, and the manoeuvre was continuing under goodconditions.(2) He considered that the only solution was to continue themanoeuvre.   The rest was disaster.(3) He Avas quite unmoved when I told him of the weight of theforces moving up on the line Bethune-St. Omer.  He saidthat the German Armoured Divisions were reduced bycasualties.(4) He talked of studying the question of feeding Blanchardfrom the sea. I told him that we knew the difficulties and had little chance of doing much.(5) Weygand was confident.General Weygand had demanded that the operation shouldcontinue. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff had both been of the view thatit was better that the operation should continue, since, if the B.E.F.were to retire on the Channel ports, it was unlikely that more thana small part of the force could be got away.The Secretary of State for War said that he had sent a telegram to Lord Gort reporting the Prime Minister&apos;s conversation withGeneral Weygand. The telegram had stated that we realisedLord Gort&apos;s difficulties, and that, if he found it impossible tocontinue operations in accord with General Weygand &apos;s plan, heshould inform the British Government, so that the French could beinformed, and all possible naval and air steps taken to cover the move to the coast.The Prime Minister said that there had been reports of acatastrophic situation at Boulogne. It had been reported that theGermans had captured one of the forts and were shelling the town.A signal had been sent from the Admiralty ordering the evacuation,and stating that destroyers were being sent to take off the troops.This signal, however, had crossed a signal from the Senior naval officer at Boulogne, stating that the situation was considerablyeasier, and that the British troops Avere holding on, although theywere being fairly heavily bombed. The fact that the Germans werebombing the town was a clear indication that they had not capturedit. The orders to evacuate Boulogne had accordingly been cancelled.There Avas no doubt that our troops were undergoing a great ordealand he would suggest that it might be of the greatest help to them if even a few hundred marines could be landed to reinforce them.The Chief of Naval Staff was invited to find out whether a party of marines Avas available.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to enquire whether the Officer in Command at Boulogne was anxious to receive
a reinforcement. A decision whether to send a reinforcement should depend on his reply, provided trained troops were available.The Prime Minister said that a Tank Regiment haddisembarked at Calais and had been placed under Lord Gort. Theyhad been ordered to clear the route to St. Omer, but had encounteredenemy forces 3 miles out of Calais. No details of the fighting had yet been received. The remainder of the armoured division hadbeen disembarked at Cherbourg and had now reached a point southof Abbeville.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that 250,000rations had been landed at Calais. He was hopeful that meanswould be found to get them through to the army. The ammunitionposition, however, was serious.Summing up the position, the Prime Minister thought that,even regarding the latest news in its most favourable light, therewas as yet little ground for confidence. He felt, however, that wehad no choice in the matter but to do our best to conform to general weygand&apos;s plan. Any other course would wreck the chance ofGeneral Weygand&apos;s plan succeeding.According to a message from Sir Roger Keyes, the King ofthe Belgians had said that he would fully understand if the B.E.F.was being withdrawn, but that it could only have one result for theBelgian Army, i.e., capitulation. So long as we adhered to theplan, the Belgians would conform to it. The Belgian army wouldhave fallen back to the line of the Yser by the following day.Attention was drawn to telegram No. 16 from Geneva. this telegram reported that Herr Burckhardt had seen an official of theGerman Ministry for Foreign Affairs the previous day, who had come straight from Berlin. This official said that popular feeling in Germany was not elated, and that the situation was consideredserious. A very high official in the German Ministry for ForeignAffairs had said that, if the present attack could be held for a fewweeks, there was danger of a complete collapse.The War Cabinet agreed that it would be useful that this telegram should be repeated to our Ambassador in Paris.The Secretary of State for War said that General Dill had hada personal message from Lord Gort earlier in the day, suggesting that the former should fly over to Lord Gort&apos;s headquarters in thecourse of the day, since the situation could not be fully appreciatedexcept by someone on the spot. If necessary, General Dill might perhaps fly over to Lord Gort on the following day.The War Cabinet agreed to a suggestion by the Secretary ofState for War that he should send a personal message to Lord Gortfrom the members of the War Cabinet, expressing their apprecia-tion of his difficulties and of the spirit of fortitude and resourcewith which he was meeting them.The War Cabinet took note of these statements and approved the decisions outlined by the Prime Minister.Richmond Terrace, S.W&apos;. 1,May 23, 1940.
