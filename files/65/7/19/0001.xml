The western front.Despatch ofadditionalfighter aircraft to France.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that an urgent appeal had beenreceived from France for the despatch of additional fighter aircraft.This request must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.After a discussion, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (i) That arrangements should be made for the immediate despatch of the equivalent of 4 fighter squadrons toFrance.(ii) That preparations should be made for the despatch of2 additional fighter squadrons at very short notice, if itwas so decided.(iii) That a decision whether to send the 2 additional squadrons to France should be taken in the light of Air MarshalJoubert de la Ferte&apos;s report later in the day.(iv) That the French should be informed of the decision at (i)only.(Note.-The Chief of the Air Staff informed the Air Staff ofthese decisions at 12 noon.)The western front (con-tinued).Progress of operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that on theWestern Front, starting from the north and going south, theposition appeared to be somewhat as follows : The Germans held the isthmus between South Beveland and the mainland, but not the island of Walcheren. The line held by the belgians then went through the Antwerp forts to a point 6 or7 miles north of Louvain, where it joined the British left flank. Onthe left we still held our line; but our right had fallen back behind the TJyle to the river Lashe, in order to conform with the French.The French line was to the east of Charleroi, and thence toFlorennes. South of this point there had been a break and theposition was obscure. The old line to the north ofHirson had notbeen broken, and the French were holding the northern edge of thistown. Between Hirson and Mezieres, which was still in Frenchhands, the sub-Maginot Line had been broken and enemy mechanisedforces had penetrated as far as Marie and Neufchatel.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff added that there seemed to be no question that the French had been surprised andthat there had not been much fighting. There was no doubt thatthe situation was most critical. The Germans had made this largepenetration with mechanised forces, but it did not appear that the infantry had followed up behind. All now depended on whetherthe French would fight with vigour in the counter-attack which general Gamelin proposed to launch.The Chief of the Air Staff gave particulars of the air operations carried out in the previous 24 hours.The fighter forces of the R.A.F. Component with the B.E.F.had shot down 25 aircraft. Twelve of our fighter aircraft had been lost. The fighter squadrons of the Advanced Air Striking force had shot down 15 enemy aircraft for certain, and perhaps two more.Four of our aircraft were missing and 3 had crashed, but the pilotswere uninjured.His Majesty&apos;s The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadAmbassador in spoken on the telephone on the previous day to Sir LancelotBrussels. Oliphant,  who  had  informed  him  that  he  and  the  french ambassador were on the point of leaving Brussels. He had repliedthat it was impossible to appreciate the local situation from London,and that the two Ambassadors must judge for themselves as to the propriety  of their  leaving  Brussels.    The  point  which  wasAir operations by the british air Forces inFrance.
particularly troubling Sir Lancelot Oliphant was that his relationswith the Belgian Foreign Minister might become difficult if he decided to remain in Brussels at the desire of King Leopold, but against the wishes of the Belgian Government.A further telephone message had been received fromSir Lancelot at midnight, to the effect that he and the french ambassador had decided to stay where they were for the moment.They had informed M. Spaak, without giving any reasons for their decision.   Sir Lancelot Oliphant had burnt his ciphers.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.3. The Secretary of State for Air gave the following detailsin regard to the heavy bomber attack on military objectives inGermany on the previous night.In addition to attacks by 12 Heavy Bombers on objectives west of the Rhine, 93 aircraft had taken part in the main operation andthree had failed to return, but one of these had been accounted forin France.Visibility in some areas had been patchy, but nevertheless about50 per cent, of the aircraft had located their main targets and allbut ten of those aircraft which had failed to do so had bombed theiralternative targets at marshalling yards or coke ovens.The main bulk of the attack had been on the oil objectives and eight of these seemed to have been successfully located and attackedas follows :  Duisburg : Low - temperature carbonisation plant. :Blazing.Bottrop: Hydrogenation plant and power station. Believed, direct hits.Gelsenkirchen : Hydrogenation plant and power station. Flashes seen after bombing.Homberg : Fischer Tropsch plant (synthetic oil plant) and power station. Blew up violently.Ramen and Sterkrade Holten : Both synthetic oil plants. Left burning.Dortmund : Synthetic oil. Tremendous explosion whichshook the aircraft at 10,000 ft.Hamborn : Coking plant. Direct hits.One pilot descending through clouds over his target had found himself in a balloon barrage, but had successfully extricated himself.Another air attack on similar targets but on a smaller scalewould be carried out that night. The Heavy Bomber Force wouldalso attack certain other targets to be selected by the Commander-in-Chief, British Air Forces in France.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The western front (eon-tin ued).Attack on mili-tary objectives in Germany bythe heavy bomber Force.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 2.)The naval situation.Arrival of Dutchnaval vessels.Fmemy attacks on warships and shipping.4. The Chief of the Naval Staff said that a number of Dutchnaval vessels, including 1 Cruiser, 2 Destroyers, 9 Submarines anda small Mine-layer, had reached this country. It was proposed toarrange that all Dutch naval vessels should be based on Falmouth.A number of attacks had been carried out on shipping, all fromthe air. The Italian S.S. Foscola had been sunk. Two greek ships had been attacked off the mouth of the Scheldt. H.M.S.Valentine had been hit off Walcheren and had gone ashore offTerneuzen. H.M.S. Hussar had also been bombed and hit, but had reached port safely.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
Operations in norway.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 3.)S35. The Chief of the Naval Staff reported that the S.S. Chobry,on passage from Narvik to Bodo, had been attacked from the air and hit by a bomb, and had had to be abandoned. There were1,000 survivors, but it was feared that there might be anything upto 1,000 casualties. H.M.S. Somali had also been bombed and damaged, and, after landing survivors, was returning to Scapa.Shore-based aircraft were now on their way to Narvik. It was hoped that they would be in a position to operate from land on the19th May.The Prime Minister read out a telegram from Lord Cork,reporting that the landing at Bjervik had been successfully carriedout; that the German forces had suffered a number of casualties,including 70 prisoners; and that the operations in this area were proceeding satisfactorily.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Iceland. 6.   The Chief of the Naval Staff said that a small force had(Previous been sent up to the North of the Island to occupy the aerodrome.Reference: A Territorial brigade was now on its way to Iceland to relieve theW.M.

In reply to the Foreign Secretary, he said that theConclusions, question of making arrangements for the accommodation of ourMinute 5.)        troops in Iceland during the winter months were being put in hand.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 5.)contraband control.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that therewas little change in the position regarding the possibility of Italycoming into the war against us. There were, however, a number ofindications which threw some light on her attitude : (i) The sailing of the Conte Di Savoia and the homewardjourney of the Rex.(ii) Paris telegram No. 200 DIPP, dated the 15th May, inwhich Mr. Bullitt was reported as stating that president roosevelt had sent a further exceedingly strong message to Signor Mussolini on the evening of the 14th May. Ithad already been delivered. Mr. Bullitt had also toldSir Ronald Campbell that, having heard that steps werebeing taken to transfer Italian marine insurances from london to New York, he had suggested to president roosevelt that not only should any new Italianinsurances be refused, but that existing insurancesshould be cancelled. President Roosevelt had repliedthat he thought he could manage, this.(iii) The United States Ambassador in London had informed the Foreign Secretary that he had spoken on the telephone to the United States Ambassador in Rome,who had said that the position was neither better norworse.(iv) Sir Percy Loraine had reported by telephone that, inaccordance with his instructions, he had told count ciano that we were ready to enter into discussions with the Italian Government with the object ofminimising so far as possible, the annoyances caused bythe present administration of our contraband control.Count Ciano had taken the suggestion in good part, andhad said that discussions of the kind suggested mightbe useful.
(v) On the previous evening the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs had spoken in the. same sense to the Italian Ambassador in London. SignorBastianini, like Count Ciano, had thought that the suggested discussions might be useful at the presentdifficult juncture. He had said that the contraband control dispute was of the highest importance to thefuture of Anglo-Italian relations.(vi) On the general situation, Signor Bastianini had said thatthe Italian Governments attitude would not be entirelygoverned by the issue of the battle on the Meuse.Apparently he did not despair of preserving the peace between the two countries, for he had remarked &quot; Toutn&apos;est pas fini entre nous.&quot; Reflections on the honour ofthe Italian services were the kind of thing that was particularly damaging to Anglo-Italian relations.Signor Bastianini had instanced the action of the british navy in insisting on searching the Conte Di Savoia,although the Captain of that vessel had given his wordof honour that Dr. Schacht was not on board.(vii) Sir Percy Loraine had found that Count Ciano wasaccepting at their face value the German accounts oftheir successes in the battle in the Meuse valley. TheForeign Secretary had thought it essential that count ciano should be given some more reliable military information without delay and, on the previous evening,the Foreign Office had telephoned to Sir Percy Lorainean up-to-date appreciation of the situation which hadbeen prepared in the Offices of the War Cabinet.Sir Percy had already reported that he had found the appreciation very useful and that he would be glad ifa similar appreciation could be sent to him daily duringthe continuance of the battle.(viii) The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to circulatethat day a Memorandum on the courses of action opento us in the event of an Italian aggression againstYugoslavia. Italian aggression in that quarter, ifunaccompanied by an attack against our own interests,would put us into a particularly difficult situation, since we did not want war with Italy, but could not afford the damage which would be caused to our prestige byinaction.He hoped that his colleagues might be able to suggest improve-ments on the line which he had proposed in his Memorandum.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statement.(ii) Agreed that the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee of theChiefs of Staff Committee should furnish the ForeignOffice daily with an appreciation of the militarysituation which should be telephoned to His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Rome.(iii) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum on thepossible courses of action open to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the event of Italian aggression againstYugoslavia should be placed on the Agenda for their meeting on the following day.Possibility of italian aggres-sion againstYugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 108thConclusions,Minute 13.)
8. The First Sea Lord said that five armed merchant cruisersfrom the Northern Patrol had been ordered to patrol the Spanishand Portuguese coasts and to stop Italian ships in the event of warwith Italy.The S.S. Conte di Savoia had sailed from Genoa to New Yorkthe previous day, and was due at Gibraltar at 2 a.m. the following morning. The First Sea Lord asked whether, if S.S. Rex, en route from New York to Genoa, was unescorted by a man-of-war, butshowed no signs of putting into Gibraltar in accordance with the contraband control instructions, we should insist on her compliance with the regulations.The War Cabinet :-(1) Took note of the above statement.(2) Agreed that, in the event of the S.S. Rex disregarding our contraband control instructions at Gibraltar, she shouldnot be interfered with.Italy.Diversion ofshipping fromtheMediterranean.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 120thConclusions,Minute 4.)9. The Minister of Shipping said that, in view of the present state of tension with Italy, the Ministry of Shipping required aCabinet decision on the question whether further ships should beallowed to enter the Mediterranean. It was also a question forconsideration whether ships now in passage through theMediterranean or in Mediterranean ports, particularly in Tunisand East of Algiers, should be told to clear. It would take about five days for ships to reach safety from the middle of theMediterranean. Steps had been taken to thin out the shipping, butthere was still a large number of vessels in British service in theMediterranean and Black Sea.The Director-General, Ministry of Shipping, said that therewere about 120 British ships in the Mediterranean and Black Sea,apart from the French and neutral ships. The Ministry of Shipping-had been in consultation with the Admiralty, and certain steps hadbeen taken to improve the situation such, for example, as instructionsto ships to discharge at Bordeaux instead of Marseilles, and toproceed to West African instead of North African ports. It had also been agreed that ships which had not yet passed Aden should go round the Cape. The decision now required was what shouldbe done to ships now at Port Said.The Lord President of the Council recalled that on the 7th May,the War Cabinet had decided that ships should continue to beallowed to pass through the Mediterranean in both directions, butthat a careful watch should be kept on the position from day to day.The matter had again been before the War Cabinet on the 13thMay, when the Minister of Shipping had said that during the ensuing four days the position in the Mediterranean would improve.He Cthe Lord President) suggested that these arrangements should stand, but that a special watch should be kept on the position inthe Eastern Mediterranean, where the greatest danger lay.The Prims Minister agreed. Reports were so frequent andcontradictory about the intentions of Italy that it was impossibleto do more than watch the situation and continue to thin out theshipping as much as possible.naval dispositions.(previous erence:W.M.

(40) 115thConclusions,Minute 8.)10. The Secretary of State for War sought the authority ofthe War Cabinet to issue immediate instructions for the evacuation of British Service families from Gibraltar and Aden in accordancewith plans which were already in existence. He considered that itwould be too difficult to take similar action in the case of Malta.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the essentialthing was that a compulsory order to leave should be given to thewives and children of British military and official personnel, whosepresence in these garrisons would be most undesirable in the eventof war.The War Cabinet agreed To authorise the Secretary of State for War and theSecretary of State for Air, in consultation with the otherdepartments concerned, to carry out forthwith the evacua-tion schemes for Aden and Gibraltar as previouslyplanned.Italy.Action to betaken withregard to Cretein the event ofwar.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 122ndConclusions,Minute 4.)11. Reference was made to Athens telegram No. 257 DIPP,dated the 15th May, in which Sir Michael Palairet asked what heshould say to the Greek President of the Council as to our measures for denying Crete to the Italians in the event of war with Italy. Hethought that we ought at once to make plans for occupying the island ourselves. Could he warn the President of the Council that,if war with Italy broke out, we should be obliged to do this ? Greececould not hold Crete by herself against a large-scale Italian landing.The British Military Attache in Athens had suggested that the onlymethod of enabling the Greeks themselves to improve the Cretandefences would be to supply them at once with artillery, includinganti-aircraft guns, for use solely in Crete.The following points were made in discussion : -(1) The Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 156) showed that the paramount importance, of denying Crete to theItalians was a matter on which the British and french high Commands were in agreement. The BritishCommanders-in-Chief had been instructed to formulatethe necessary plans in consultation with the FrenchCommanders in the Mediterranean.
(2) It was essential that the British Commanders-in-Chiefshould keep Sir Michael Palairet fully informed of theAnglo-French plans for carrying out this object.(3) The Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, whowas placing a strong submarine patrol off Crete, wouldbe faced with a difficult decision if, before the outbreakof war with Italy, the Italians attempted to land troopsin the island. The two most likely contingencieswere : (a) British   Naval   Commanders   might   see   Italiantransports approaching Crete.(b) They might see Italian transports actually landingtroops on the island.In contingency (b), the British Naval Officer on the spotwould presumably have no option but to open fire on theItalians, thus beginning hostilities.(4) Admiral Darlan&apos;s orders to the Admiral in command of theFrench Naval Forces in the Mediterranean did notappear to provide for sufficiently rapid action in thevarious contingencies which might arise.(5) The French proposals for the occupation of Melos, Salamis,Navarino and Argostoli seemed to be somewhatimprudent.(6) More effective measures against the Italians appeared tobe more ready to our hands; for example, an attack onEast Africa by the South African Brigade, and theincitement of the Abyssinians to revolt.The War Cabinet-Invited the Defence Committee to meet at 6 p.m. that evening to consider generally what action we should take in the event of war with Italy, and in particular what action we should take in regard to Crete. The foreign secretary was invited to send a representative to themeeting.United States of 12.   The Foreign Secretary referred  to telegram No.  118America.

He had mentioned fifty or even one hundred.They dated mostly, he thought, from the end of the last war or soon after, but were still serviceable. They had good guns and there wasplenty of ammunition to go with them.
British 13.   The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff informedExpeditionary the War Cabinet that he had had a conversation over the telephoneForce. that  morning with  the  Chief  of the  General  Staff,  BritishReport by Vice- Expeditionary Force,  regarding  the  situation  of  the  BritishChief of &quot;the Expeditionary Force.   The line had been extremely indistinct, and imperial the conversation had had, perforce, to be conducted in parables.General Staff. So far as he had been able to ascertain from this conversation, theposition was as follows:  On the left, where our troops were in touch with the belgians, there had been no serious pressure. In the centre(First Division) there had been local attacks on Louvain which,however, had not penetrated, and here, again, there had been no serious pressure. On the right the Second Division had been severely attacked but had not given ground. There had beena certain penetration by the enemy over the Dyle on the rightof this Division, which had caused a slight withdrawal on thepart of the French and a consequent readjustment of our line.General Headquarters were not, however, disturbed about thesituation in this area.Further south, however, from the direction of Mezieres,the Germans had made a deep penetration with armoured forces. Hirson had been captured by the Germans, who were reported to be pressing forward to Capelle and were believed to have reached Vervins and might be advancing in the direc-tion of Laon. In view of this situation, orders had been issued,either by General Georges or General Billotte, or both, for a withdrawal that night to a line as follows : Trelon-Marpent thence North-eastwards along theSambre to the Canal junction East of Charleroi thencealong the River Senne to Hal thence through Brussels toMalines and on to the Antwerp defences.One of the main difficulties which the British Expe-ditionary Force was encountering was the manner in which theGerman Air Force dominated the battlefield.The Prime Minister took an extremely grave view of this news.He considered that a withdrawal from our line on account of thepenetration of the French line by a force of some 120 german armoured vehicles was quite unjustifiable and would expose theBritish Army to far more serious risks than if they remained intheir present position and fought. He therefore felt that the orderto withdraw was one which could not possibly be accepted withoutfurther consultation, and he accordingly proposed that he should himself go to France that very afternoon to discuss the matter withthe French.The War Cabinet expressed general agreement with thisview and :  Invited the Prime Minister to proceed that afternoon to France, with a view to ascertaining the positionand representing strong objections to such a with-drawal.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,May 16, 1940.
