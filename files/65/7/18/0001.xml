The western front.Progress of operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 122ndConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that he had had an alarmistmessage from M. Reynaud earlier in the morning. M. Reynaud had said that the Germans had broken through at Sedan, and that theroad to Paris was open. He had made an urgent appeal for Britishhelp. He (the Prime Minister) had refused to accept so gloomy a picture of the situation. He had pointed out that it was impossiblefor us to send any more divisions to France at the present moment;.and even if we had been ready to denude this country of troops,it would be quite impossible to get them quickly to the scene ofaction.He had then spoken to General Georges who had seemed quitecalm. General Georges&apos; view of the position was that in the Norththings were fairly satisfactory; pressure was considerable in thecentre; in the South, the situation was undoubtedly serious. TheGermans had broken through on a fairly wide front, but this was now plugged (&quot; colmate &quot;). General Georges had paid a tribute tothe wonderful assistance of the Royal Air Force. He had made no direct request for further help. He (the Prime Minister) had saidthat we would do everything we could, but we could not denudeEngland of her essential defences.The Prime Minister said that he had also had a telegram fromGeneral Gamelin, who had said that, although the position was serious between Namur and Sedan, he viewed the situation withcalm. He had asked for all possible air assistance.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, althoughinformation was incomplete, it seemed that the German thrust atSedan was blocked for the moment. He thought that the germans had crossed the Meuse by normal methods and not by the use ofamphibian tanks. The answer to tanks was artillery and it was reported that one French &quot; seventy-five &quot; had accounted for no lessthan 13 tanks. It seemed likely, therefore, that the French artilleryin this area had not been properly disposed to meet a tank attack.The French forces in this area also seemed to have fallen back insome disorder.General Georges had sent Out an order that it might benecessary to swing back his left flank to the line Charleroi-Wavre.Namur was in flames and the Germans had crossed the Meuse in several places between Namur and Givet. The French left met theright of the British Army near Wavre. He had had a telephoneconversation with Lord Gort who said that our troops were well established on the line. They were well provided with artillery and anti-tank weapons.The divisional cavalry had withdrawn and joined the reserve.The right flank was our chief anxiety, and Lord Gort had put an additional division into the front line to strengthen the pointof junction with the French left.A French battalion had been cut off at Bergen-op-Zoom andwe had lost the land communications with S. Beveland andWalcheren. The Belgians were holding the line from Antwerp toLouvain.The Prime Minister said that he had received a message from admiral Keyes to the effect that the Belgian Government had notyet decided to evacuate Brussels. The Belgian Army had with-drawn to a new line and he was confident that they could hold their position provided that they obtained strong air co-operation. he anticipated a strong German attack on Antwerp from the North.He suggested that, if practicable, two destroyers should be sentto the mouth of the Scheldt to provide supporting fire.The Chief of Naval Staff pointed out that there was insufficientdepth of water at the mouth of the Scheldt for any vessel larger than a motor torpedo boat.[21294] b 2
Air operations. The Chief of the Air Staff gave the War Cabinet an accountof the air operations which had been carried out on the previous day.During the morning 6 Blenheims had attacked communications in the Breda area. Bursts had been observed on the cross roadsat the Eastern edge of Breda and also on the Breda-Tilburg railway line. All 6 aircraft had returned. In the afternoon 28 Blenheimshad attacked troop movements on the roads in Bouillon, Givonne and around Sedan. 50 250-lb. and 580 40-lb. bombs had been dropped.Direct hits had been observed on traffic, and trees had fallen acrossthe road and caught fire. Twelve bombs had. burst on housesflanking the main road. Bombs from two aircraft had burst onGivonne and a large column of lorries had been bombed near LaChapelle. One of the 28 Blenheims had been shot down near theBelgian border, and 6 were still unaccounted for.There had been 64 sorties by heavy bombers during the night.These had included attacks on Maastricht, Hasselt, Munchen-Gladbach, Breda and Eoosendal. Mines had also been laid,including five in the Kiel Canal. One out of the 64 heavy bombershad failed to return.Six Battles had carried out a dawn attack against pontoonbridges across the Meuse in the region of Sedan. Despite heavy a.A. fire, the attack had been pressed home, and several bridgeshad been destroyed or damaged. Five out of the six aircraft had returned safely, and the sixth had successfully force-landed afterthe pilot had been wounded.Sixty-seven Battles and Blenheims had attacked bridges acrossthe Meuse in the vicinity of Sedan, and columns and concentrations of troops in the area to the north of the river. Extremely satis-factory results had been obtained, two permanent and three pontoonbridges having been destroyed and several others hit. Direct hitshad also been made on columns of tanks in village streets, and theroads had been blocked in several places. Five M.E. 109&apos;s had been shot down. Thirty-six out of the 67 of our aircraft were so farunaccounted for, the majority of losses having been due to very heavy anti-aircraft fire, including fire from guns mounted on lorriesand motor-cycle combinations.Our fighters had shot down ten enemy aircraft and had seriously damaged three others.   Three of our fighters were missing.Strategical reconnaissance by aircraft of the Air Componenthad been carried out, during which two or three of our aircraft had been lost. Fighters of the Air Component had brought down12 enemy aircraft and had seriously damaged 3 others, against a loss of 7 Hurricanes.Fighters from this country had covered the evacuation fromThe Hook.   All our aircraft had returned, reporting that no enemy aircraft had been seen.   No concentrations or large road or railmovements had been observed.(Previous Information about the action of the Defiants on the 13th MayReference:        had now been received from two wounded Pilot Officers who had.M. (40) 121st taken part in this engagement and who, after escaping by parachute,Conclusions,      had arrived on the previous day at Dover.   They stated that the minute l.)        Defiants had been attacked near Dordrecht by ME. 109&apos;s andJ.U. 87&apos;s, of which one M.E. 109 and three J.U. 87&apos;s had beenbrought down.   The other Defiants in this engagement had been shot down in flames.Blenheim fighters of the Coastal Command had patrolledThe Hook from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. No enemy aircraft had been encountered. Fires at oil tanks and refineries had been observedaround The Hook and near The Hague. A number of mines hadbeen laid.The Chief of the Air.Staff said that he had recalled an officerfrom Air Headquarters in France to report on the general state ofour Air Forces there.   This Officer had said that our bombers had
been undergoing a very arduous time, but nevertheless the personnelwere in good heart. Meanwhile, the losses had been extremelysevere. There remained 34 Battles out of 128; 24 Hurricanes outof 48; and 32 Blenheims. The fighter pilots were said to be intremendous fettle, but weary.The Prime Minister reported that air photographs of thebarrier at Karlsruhe showed very considerable damage, which would permit of the passage of mines. Some difficulty had been experienced during the first and second nights in streaming minesW.M. (40) 121st into the tributaries, and the mines were now being streamed directinto the Rhine. At Thionville, leading into the Moselle, 40 mineshad been captured owing to the rapid advance of the enemy&apos;s troops.Steps were to be taken to place mines in the Meuse that night.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Royal marine operation.(previous reference:Conclusions,Minute 1.)Air Policy. 2.   In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding(Previous Minute, the War Cabinet again considered what action should be reference:        taken by the long-range bomber force, and the position in regardW.M.

Bodo wasalso occupied by our troops and a defensive position was being prepared.

(40) 121stConclusions,.Minute 3.)Demolitions.Destruction of oil stocks.4. The Chief of Naval Staff said that our troops had beensafely withdrawn from Holland on the previous night. warships and fast merchant ships had been sent to evacuate the Dutch Army.The order to cease fire had, however, been given by the Dutch high command and only a small number of Dutch troops had, in fact,been evacuated.A French submarine had been sunk off Terschelling.The position in regard to demolitions was as follows : Amsterdam no information.Ymuiden demolitions carried out.The Hook all charges placed. Demolition prevented byDutch authorities.Rotterdam-demolitions carried out south of the river.Demolitions north of the river stopped by Dutch authorities.Flushing effective demolition caused by German bombing.Antwerp no demolitions yet effected.The First Lord of the Admiralty added that all oil stocks atAmsterdam had been destroyed and five-sixths of the total(460,000 tons) at Rotterdam.
Determination The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had of Netherland     received a call that morning from the Netherland Minister, who *Government to   had brought with him the text of the proclamation by Generalcontinue the      Winkelman, the Netherland Commander-in-Chief, announcing thestruggle. surrender of Rotterdam and Utrecht in order to save further uselessloss of life. He (the Foreign Secretary) had said that he had seenthis proclamation in the Press; he could not express any opinionupon it, except that he hoped that there would in no circumstances be any question of the Netherlands either through theirCommander-in-Chief or through the Government-entering uponnegotiations with the Germans. He hoped that the position was merely that the Netherlands had stopped military operations incertain areas, and would remain passive under protest. The Nether-land Minister had confirmed that this was, in fact, the position.Later in the meeting the Foreign Secretary reported that hehad received a message from the Netherland Minister that he had just learnt from the Netherland Minister for Foreign Affairs, whowas in Paris, that he was arranging for a statement to be broadcastthat a contingent of Netherland troops which had retired into belgium was being re-formed in order to serve as the nucleus of the netherland Military Force which was now being organised inEngland by the Netherland Government. The proposed broadcastwould also state that the Netherland Fleet was co-operating withthe Allied Fleet in the North Sea and in the East Indies, and thatthe Governor-General of the East Indies had ample military andother forces at his disposal.The Minister of Information said that it was important tomake an announcement in this country as soon as possible in orderto disabuse the public of the idea that the Netherlands were out ofthe war.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed, and asked that the Minister of Information should co-ordinate his action inthis matter with the Netherland Minister in London.The Prime Minister said that it should be made clear that theaction announced in General Winkelman&apos;s proclamation amountedto no more than a military capitulation in a particular area.The War Cabinet agreed That the Minister of Information, in consultation with the netherland Minister, should arrange for publicity to begiven to the decision of the Netherland Government notto abandon the war.Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 122ndConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that areport had been received by the United States Ambassador inLondon from his colleague in Rome. This report might besummarised as follows : &apos;The United States Ambassador had seen Count Ciano on tuesday, the 14th May, 1940, for the purpose of discussingUnited States-Italian trade questions. Count Ciano had saidthat the situation had become so serious that it would not bepossible for him to give much consideration to these questions.A week ago he had thought that there was an&apos; even chance ofItaly staying out of the war, but now he thought that the oddswere 10 to 1 on her going in with Germany. Count Ciano couldnot give a precise indication of the date of her entry into thewar, but the Ambassador bad gathered that it was very closeat hand.The Ambassador had then raised the question of evacuating United States citizens from Italy.   When a week
ago he had asked the same question, Count Ciano had told himthis was unnecessary, but on the present occasion he had expressed no opinion.Count Ciano said that Signor Mussolini had already made up his mind. He was convinced that the information in regardto military operations which Herr Hitler had given to signor mussolini in the past had always been correct; and the infor-mation which Herr Hitler had sent that day showed a completeGerman victory in Belgium and the Netherlands. The populardemonstrations which were taking place throughout Italyshowed that all but a very small minority of the people were infavour of Italy entering the war.Contraband    &apos; The Foreign Secretary said that the Marchese Patrizi, thecontrol. Special Economic Attache at the Italian Embassy, had, when callingon the Parliamentary Under-Secretary the previous evening, madea communication on the following lines : Anglo-Italian relations had now reached boiling-point, andhe therefore wished to make the following suggestion inregard to British contraband control : Now that Norway, theNetherlands and part of Belgium had fallen under Germancontrol, it should be possible for us to secure our aims bycontrolling supplies at their source instead of through actionin the Mediterranean. He would be very willing to arrange forthis question to be examined by experts if it was desired.The Foreign Secretary did not attach much hope to thesuggestion, but he had given instructions for it to be examined. Theprevious evening he had instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Rome, to tell Count Ciano that, while we had not yet received theItalian Government&apos;s Memorandum on Contraband Control, wewere ready to enter into discussions with the Italian Governmentwith the object of minimising so far as possible the annoyancescaused to the Italian Government by the present administration of contraband control (telegram No. 366 DIPP). He was not hopeful that this step would serve any valuable purpose, except in so far aswe might get publicity for it in Italian business circles opposed tothe entry of their country into the war.Suggested Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that it might be of valuemessage from if the Prime Minister, on assuming office, were to send a communi-fche Prime cation to Signor Mussolini. Perhaps the general heads of theMinister to &apos; message might be communicated to Sir Percy Loraine by telegram,Signor with authority for him to cast the message into the most appropriate-Mussolini, form, having regard to the situation in Rome.The Prime Minister said that he was quite ready to send sucha message, and had already thought of doing so. He would proposeto say that, on assuming the office of Prime Minister, he wished to assure Signor Mussolini of his hope that this country and italy should not be divided by bloodshed; we were finding the war hard,but we were confident of ultimate victory; it would be a disasterof the first magnitude if any irrevocable step were taken, but, ifthis should happen, we should have no choice but to pursue thematter to the end, and this we should do. The Prime Minister saidthat he would draft a message and then consult with the foreign secretary.The War Cabinet took note (a) Of the statement by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.(b) That the Prime Minister proposed to send a personal message to Signor Mussolini on the lines indicated in thediscussion.
Australian and 6.   The Chief of Naval Staff said that the slow Convoy ofNew Zealand Australian and New Zealand troops was due at Suez on theTroop Convoys. 16th May. He asked for a decision as to the destination of the(Previous fast convoy (18 knots) carrying 14.000 Australian and New ZealandReference: troops. If it continued its voyage, it would arrive at Suez on thew.M. (40) 121st 31st May. A decision was required that day if it was to be divertedConclusions, to the Cape without proceeding to Colombo. If diverted that day,Minute 4.) it would reach England on the 15th June; if allowed to proceedto Colombo and then diverted via the Cape, it would arrive inEngland on the 21st June.A minor complication might arise owing to the probable refusal of the Chinese crews of some of the ships to proceed West of the cape. The replacement of the Chinese by British crews mightnot be practicable and the transhipment of the troops to other ships would involve a most undesirable delay.It was agreed that it was out of the question to send the fastconvoy to Suez. Further, these troops, although not fully equipped,might well prove a very valuable addition to the forces in thiscountry.The War Cabinet agreed (a) That the fast Australian and New Zealand troop convoyshould be diverted to England via the Cape forthwith.(b) That the Admiralty should take any steps necessary toensure that the Chinese crews of some of the ships com-pleted the trip to England.Switzerland.Danger ofGermaninvasion.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto an unnumbered telegram, dated 15th May, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Representative, Berne, reporting that His Majesty&apos;sConsulates at Zurich and Basle were both evacuating for the night;they had been unable to tell Mr. Kelly their news on the telephone,but he expected a messenger that evening who would be able toinform him. The French Embassy had informed Mr. Kelly thatthe situation was very bad, and that a German attack onSwitzerland was possible at 3 o&apos;clock that morning.In reply to the Foreign Secretary, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff said that it had always been considered that it wouldbe to the disadvantage of Germany to attack Switzerland, buteverything depended upon the strength of Swiss resistance. If theGermans obtained possession of aerodromes in Switzerland, it wouldbe easier for them to operate their bombers against the south ofFrance.The Prime Minister said that the Swiss were a brave and determined people, and he was confident that they would fight theinvader.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Japan.probable attitude.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 766, dated the 13th May, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Tokyo, reporting an interview that day with theJapanese Minister for Foreign Affairs who had repeated to him the assurance previously given by the Vice-Minister for Foreign affairs that, for her part, Japan intended to hold to her policy of non-involvement. This was satisfactory, in so far as any assurance had any value.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
The UnitedStates ofAmerica.personal message fromthe PrimeMinister toPresidentRoosevelt.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 120thConclusions,Minute 6.)United States ofAmerica.Decision to evacuate UnitedStates citizensfrom the UnitedKingdom andFrance.Interviewbetween lord lothian andPresidentRoosevelt.9. The Prime Minister gave particulars of the personal message which it had been agreed he should send to president roosevelt informing him of the seriousness of the situation.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad been informed by the United States Ambassador that morningthat he had received instructions from Mr. Cordell Hull to urgeUnited States citizens to leave the United Kingdom. the ambassador assumed that similar instructions had been issued to theUnited States Ambassador in Paris. He was not taking any action at the moment, as he wished to co-ordinate his action with that ofhis colleague in Paris. The Ambassador had stated also that theUnited States Government was sending a ship to Bordeaux,presumably to take off United States citizens evacuated from Franceand this country. This would require special legislation to modify the Neutrality Act and this might later be of value to us.The Foreign Secretary drew attention also to telegram No. 718,dated the 13th May, 1940, in which His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Washington, reported an interview at which President Roosevelthad asked him what more the United States could do to help uswithin the limitations imposed by the Neutrality Act and UnitedStates public opinion. Lord Lothian had replied that he thoughtthat the most valuable contribution that the United States could make was to prevent the remaining neutral countries from goingover to Germany.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Portugal.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 113thConclusions,Minute 5.)11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs dealing with the positionin Portugal (W.P. (40) 154).The Foreign Secretary said that the Foreign Office thought that,so long as Italy was non-belligerent and General Franco maintainedhimself in power, the position was secure. Any change in theGovernment in Spain might, however, result in a movement againstthe Salazar regime, assisted by the Germans in Spain and portugal and abetted by the Italians.The Foreign Secretary then referred to the suggestions set outin paragraph 11 of his Memorandum. The proposals in sub-para-graph (5) were now somewhat academic, and those in sub-paragraph(1) had been acted on. He hoped, however, that consideration wouldbe given to the matters dealt with in sub-paragraphs (2), (3) and (4).As regards sub-paragraph (2), the Chief of Naval Staff saidthat two 8-inch Cruisers would shortly be arriving in the north atlantic from South American waters. These might be of use incase it was necessary to take action in the Cape Verde Islands andthe Azores.Reference was also made to the point mentioned in the con-cluding sentence of the Memorandum, that a striking force shouldbe held ready, to proceed to any destination at short notice.- [21294*] c
The Prime Minister thought that the only force which theAllies could readily dispose of, if it should be necessary to sendforces to Portugal, was probably the French Division of Cbasseurs-Alpins now at Brest.The War Cabinet :-(1) Took note of the Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs on the situation in Portugal.(2) Agreed that the Chiefs of Staff should be invited toconsider what action could usefully be taken in regardto paragraph 11 (2). (3) and (4). In particular, theAdmiralty, as the Department principally interested,should be asked to prepare a plan setting out the actionwhich should be taken in the event of it being necessaryfor us to secure strategic points in Cape Verde islands and the Azores, or on the mainland of Portugal.Spain. 12.   In   connection  with   the   discussion  recorded   in   the(Previous preceding Minute, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidlief erence:        that a communication had just been received from Mr. Eccles, theW.M. (40) 120th expert on contraband control matters, who had been visiting Spain.Conclusions       Mr. Eccles thought that the only way in which we could dealMinute 5.) &apos;      effectively with the large numbers of Germans in Spain would beto say to General Franco that, if he would reduce the large numbersof Germans now resident in Spain, we would be prepared to give him economic help.   Mr. Eccles&apos; suggestion was not, however,altogether clear, and it was proposed to await his return to thiscountry on the 17th May before taking the matter up.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been considering whether it would be a good plan that some outstanding figure in public life should be asked to go to Spain in order to maintain ourpi-estige. He had in mind that Sir Samuel Hoare might be invitedto accept this mission.The War Cabinet :-Took note of this statement and approved the foreign secretary&apos;s suggestion.TJ.S.S.R. 13.   The  Loral Privy Seal asked whether the  suggestion(Previous recorded in the preceding Minute, that an important figure in our reference:        public life should be invited to go to Spain, might not with.M. (40) 121st advantage also be adopted in regard to Russia.Conclusions, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that, beforeMinute 7.) deciding this matter, it would be as well to await the Soviet replyto our Note of the 7th May raising the question of resuming trade negotiations. If that reply was very unfavourable, he would not favour the despatch of a special representative. If, however, the reply was hopeful, he thought that this suggestion might well beconsidered.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.China.14. The Prime Minister read extracts from a message fromthe Chinese Ambassador in London reporting a very big victoryby the Chinese forces over the Japanese forces.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by the PrimeMinister.
Invasion ofGreat Britain.Danger fromparachutists andFifth Columnelements.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 120thConclusions,Minute 3.)15. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad received a report from Sir Nevile Bland as to the elaborateorganisation for co-operation between German parachutists andFifth Column elements in the Netherlands. Thus a German woman,who had been employed as a maid servant and had returned toGermany, had been landed by parachute with a party of men withthe express purpose of leading them to a particular house. It was important that the experience in the Netherlands should be broughtto the attention of those responsible in this country for guardingagainst such attack.The Chief of the Air Staff said that there had been severalreports, none of which had been substantiated, about parachutedescents on this country having been seen on the previous night.These in some cases could be traced to balloons which had been struckduring a thunderstorm which had occurred over North London.These rumours were indicative of the nervous state of the public.The Minister of Home Security said that the question of supervision of aliens was the task of the Aliens Co-co-ordination committee. There were a number of very difficult problems, and he hoped that the Prime Minister would agree that in the study ofthese he might be associated with two Members of the War Cabinet.There were various bodies and groups of persons in this country against whom action would need to be taken, but it was importantif the machine was not to be overtaxed, that the most urgent action should be taken first. The groups which he had particularly inmind were : (i) Italians and British subjects of Italian origin.(ii) Czech refugees in this country who were not enemy aliens.(iii) Refugees from the Netherlands and Belgium, some ofwhom might be German agents.(iv) The British Fascists.(v) The Communists in this country.As regards the Fascists and the Communists, he was opposed topremature action- since this might give an opportunity to those whoescaped internment to rebuild their subversive organisation.The Prime Minister said that in existing circumstances hethought it important that there should be a very large round-up of enemy aliens and suspect persons in this country. It was much better that these persons should be behind barbed-wire, and intern-ment would probably be much safer for all German-speaking personsthemselves since, when air attacks developed, public temper in thiscountry would be such that such persons would be in great dangerif at liberty.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the Chief of theImperial General Staff said that between seven and eight hundredenemy parachutist prisoners had been examined. They were men ofall ages ranging from a General of 50 to a boy of 19. Some of themthought that they had landed in England.The Prime Minister said that the matter was urgent, and he invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Minister without Portfolio to collaborate with the Minister of Home Security in the manner suggested. He hoped it would be possible for the War Cabinet toreceive a report on the whole subject in a few days&apos; time.The War Cabinet approved the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 15, 1940.
