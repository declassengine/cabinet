9n oi? ^The western front.Withdrawal ofthe B.E.F. from france.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 147thConclusions,Minute 1.)Situation atDunkirk.1. The Prime Minister said that he had received conflictingaccounts of the numbers of the British Expeditionary Force who hadbeen evacuated. The War Office figure of the numbers evacuated toDover, Ramsgate, Margate and Harwich since the 20th May were as follows : British fitBritish woundedAllies   .......Total ...92,6428,1524,447105,241The Admiralty had given a figure of 86,000.Later in the Meeting the First Lord of the Admiralty said thatthe Admiralty figure for the number landed at all the ports up to12 noon that day was 101,154.The Prime Minister asked that the War Office and theAdmiralty should, in future, collaborate in computing the numbersof British and other troops evacuated from France, with a view tosubmitting an agreed report to the War Cabinet.The Prime Minister read a report from Dunkirk stating thata ship had been sunk there that afternoon under conditions whichsuggested that it might be difficult to continue to use the harbour;that fog was seriously interfering with the evacuation; and that progress was being delayed by the withdrawal of the more moderndestroyers.The Chief of Naval Staff said that he had no knowledge of thisreport and that every available destroyer was being used.Later in the Meeting the Minister of Information read to theWar Cabinet a draft communique as to the operation of withdrawal from France and as to the very successful air fighting on the previous day (see Minute 2).The Secretary of State for War said that Lord Gort had beenplaced in a difficult position owing to the fact that the seniorFrench officers at Dunkirk had received no orders at all aboutevacuation. If the French received clear orders to evacuate as manyof the troops as possible, the British could thin out the troopsholding the perimeter, but in present circumstances Lord Gort feltcompelled to retain local reserves for counter-attack in order notto let the French down. The Secretary of State suggested that atelegram should be sent by the Prime Minister to M. Reynaud asking for the French action to be co-ordinated with that of the British.He read the terms of the proposed telegram to the War Cabinet.After discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to despatch to General Weygand a telegram in the abovesense.*(2) Approved the terms of an official statement to be made tothe Press by the Ministry of Information announcingthat evacuation was in progress, and giving somedescription of the operations which were taking place.The Air 2.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that during the operationsSituation. on the previous day the Royal Air Force had definitely accounted(Previous for 76 enemy aircraft in France and Norway.   The true figureReference: probably amounted to more.   Three of these had been shot down in w.M. (40) 146th Norway and the remainder over Dunkirk.   Against this, our totalConclusions, losses had amounted to 30.   This figure included 16 Fighters and minute 4.) 3 out of 15 heavy Bombers which had been caught by fog on* Copy attached to these Conclusions.
returning from operations on the previous night. The crews of these had been saved by jumping with parachutes. The remaining losses had been among aircraft belonging to the Fleet Air Arm and air component. Bombing operations on the previous day had been directed mainly on enemy road movements south of the british expeditionary Force.The air operations in progress that day were being hampered by fog and low cloud; nevertheless, 47 bombers were at that momentout on various missions. The bad flying weather over France was inour favour in tying the enemy to the ground and preventing him from bombing the beaches from which the British ExpeditionaryForce was evacuating. So far, only one enemy aircraft had beenreported that day over Dunkirk.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.France.Communica-tions with theFrenchGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 147thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The War Cabinet had before them the following infor-mation : (a) A telegram from the Swayne Mission to the War Office inregard to the position on the Oise Canal.(b) Reports to the Prime Minister from General Spears as tothe position of the French Army and French requests forassistance.Discussion ensued as to the extent of the help which we could afford to the French at the present juncture. Details of this discussion are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Prime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal,accompanied by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,should proceed to France on the following day.(2) Gave general approval to the line which the Prime minister proposed to take in his discussions with the FrenchGovernment.United States of        4.   The Permanent  Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAmerica. Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he had just heard that the message from United States Ambassador had asked for an audience with HisPresident Majesty The King m order to present a message from president roosevelt to His Roosevelt. He knew nothing as to the nature of the message.Majesty The The War Cabinet took note of this statement.King.Italy.Suggested direct approach to signor mussolini.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 146thConclusions,Minute 12.)5, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad just received a telephone message from Flis Majesty&apos;ambassador in Paris to the effect that M. Daladier had again raised the question of making a direct communication to Signor Mussolini,and had handed him a document setting out the lines on which he proposed to make such an approach. Sir Ronald Campbell had donehis best to dissuade M. Daladier, but the latter had only returned tothe charge.The Foreign Secretary suggested that it was useless to attemptto restrain the French any longer from making the proposedapproach, but that we must make it quite clear that they should not commit us by anything which they said to Signor Mussolini.The War Cabinet approved the line of action proposed bythe Foreign Secretary.
Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 146thConclusions,Minute 10.)Italy.Action againstItalians in the united kingdom.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 146thConclusions,Minute 11.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 15 (Saving), dated the28th May, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Lisbon reporting that dr. Salazar was said to have expressed the belief that Italy wouldnot enter the war.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.7. The Home Secretary said that the number of desperatecharacters whom he would wish to intern was 1,500 Italians, plus300 British subjects connected with Italian institutions in thiscountry.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that count ciano had raised with Sir Percy Loraine the question of evacuatingBritish subjects from Italy. The Foreign Secretary suggested that,as soon as the French Government had replied to the communication which we had made to them on the previous day, Sir Percy Loraineshould say to Count Ciano that we appreciated the fact that hewas placing no obstacle in the way of British subjects leaving Italy;that we should like to act reciprocally and facilitate the departure of Italians in this country; that the first shipload would be leavingshortly, and that we should be glad to know to which port it shouldbe directed. He (the Foreign Secretary) would be glad if theAdmiralty would at once have a ship prepared for this purpose,so that as soon as we had heard from the French Government thescheme could be put in motion, if so decided.The Foreign Secretary added that we might continue in thepresent position vis-a-vis Italy for some further time; was itnecessary that these 1,800 men should be seized at once ?The Home Secretary said that he had no objection to some further delay, provided that there was no leakage of our intentions.He assumed that the communication made to the French had dealtwith the matter on the basis of a return of the Italians to theircountry on humanitarian grounds.The Foreign Secretary confirmed that our approach had beenmade on these lines.The War Cabinet agreed (i) That no further action should be taken in regard to the internment of Italians until a reply had been receivedfrom the French Government, but that the latter shouldbe asked to expedite their reply,(ii) That in the meantime the First Lord of the admiralty should arrange for a suitable ship to be made available,in which these 1,500 Italians could be deported as soonas practicable after they had been seized,(iii) That the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary, inconsultation, should review from day to day the questionwhether these 1,500 Italians plus the 300 British subjectsconnected with Italian institutions in this country should be seized.Seizure of Cretein the Event ofItalianHostilities.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 126thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff (W.P. (40) 175) setting out the arrangements which hadbeen concerted with the French for the seizure of Crete in theevent of an Italian attack on Greek territory.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Allied forces wouldtake about 48 hours on the voyage. The ships would sail on theorders of local Commanders, without further reference to their homeGovernments,  and  arrangements had  been  made  to  give  the
Commanders as early information as possible of an Italian attack.The plan would not be set in motion unless the Italians attemptedan attack on Greek soil. The Greeks would not be informed of our intention to occupy Crete until the order for the despatch of the expedition had been issued. It might be difficult to hold Creteindefinitely, with the forces proposed, under heavy air attack fromthe Dodecanese, but by dispersing the troops to give them protection against such attack it would probably be possible to deny the useof the aerodrome to the Italians. In the last resort the aerodromecould be mined with delay action mines, before the forces wereevacuated.The War Cabinet-Approved the arrangements made for the despatch of an allied force to seize Crete in the event of an Italian attackon Greek territory, as set out in Paper No. W.P. (40) 175.Norway.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 146thConclusions,Minute 4.)9. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in regard to operations in Norway.A record of the discussion, and of the conclusions reached,is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.Invasion ofGreat Britain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 147thConclusions,Minute 3.)10. The WTar Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff (W.P. (40) 178).The Chief of the A ir Staff said that, in view of recent reportsof the possibility of a sea-borne raid on a large scale by a fleet offast motor boats, combined with air-borne raids, the Chiefs of Stafffelt that the Avhole country should be warned and roused to the imminent danger which confronted us. He drew attention to therecommendations of the Chiefs of Staff contained in paragraph 12of the Paper, (b) and (c) had already been put to the Commander-in-Chief, and he was acting accordingly. As regards (d), additional labour for beach defences would be required on a large scale. Thelength of coast to be covered was very considerable.The Lord President of the Council said that he was holding ameeting of the Ministers concerned on the following morning to dealwith the question of rousing the country. As for the provision ofadditional labour, the Minister of Labour had informed him thatDivisional Controllers had already been instructed to prepare thelabour exchanges to supply whatever was required, but the detailsof the requirements of the War Office had not yet been received.The Minister was prepared to use compulsory powers to obtainthe labour necessary. The Lord President said that he had laterconsulted the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, who fullyconcurred in the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff. He had ordered Commands to proceed immediately with defence works onthe beaches, and to put local Commanders in touch with the labour exchanges to obtain the men they required.Discussion ensued as to the possibility of different methods ofattempted invasion.The Chief of Naval Staff said that there had been definite signsof German activity on the Norwegian coast. There were alsoindications that motor-boats had been collected at Bremen and hamburg. Meanwhile, the Germans were known to have an organised force of ships at Vigo. The dispositions to deal with this latter threat were described. It might also be significant that theGermans had left one particular stretch opposite our coast clear
of mines. The position in this matter had been brought to thenotice of the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces. It was hopedthat the production of anti-tank mines for laying on beaches would start in a week&apos;s time.The Prime Minister doubted whether a raid on a large scalecould be carried out by fast motor-boats. These craft would haveto come over in flotillas, if they were to put ashore any usefulnumber of men at any one point. The Navy would have to make every endeavour to intercept such raids on the high seas.The First Sea Lord said that submarine and trawler patrols were being maintained to get information of such raids, but owingto the speed of the boats and the fact that they might effect thecrossing in darkness, the Navy could not guarantee that destroyerpatrols would be able to intercept them before they reached theshores of this country. A single cruiser finding them might sinksome of the boats, but some would probably get through.In the discussion which followed the principal points madewere :  (i) There was some doubt as to the precise numbers of motorboats which the Germans possessed, but they could be fairly quickly constructed. They would be fitted withthe aeroplane type of engine,(ii) The wake which large fast craft would leave should bevisible to air reconnaissance, but experience had shownthat it was by no means easy to keep track of the Germanmotor torpedo boats which had been operating recentlyoff the Channel ports.(iii) These  craft  could  be  readily  disguised  against  air reconnaissance as barges. Even if suspicious concen-trations were observed in the German or Dutch harbours,it would be difficult to take effective action against themby night bombing.(iv) The coast watching service had been greatly strengthenedrecently, and constant watch was being maintained.Small boat patrols along the coasts had been instituted.The Prime Minister thought that we should not hesitate tocontaminate our beaches with gas if this course would be to our advantage. We had the right to do what we liked with our ownterritory.The War Cabinet :-(i) Approved the Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40)178).(ii) Took note : (a) that the Lord President of the Council had already taken in hand the necessary measures to warnand rouse the country to the imminent danger of invasion;(b) that the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, wasordering the Army at home to a high degree ofalertness, particularly at night, and wasreviewing his dispositions in the light of the newconsiderations put forward in the Chiefs of staff report;(c) that the Ministry of Labour had made all arrange-ments to supply the necessary labour for beachdefences, and that the local military authorities had been instructed to get in touch with theemployment exchanges in order to obtain their requirements.
(iii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to report to theWar Cabinet the naval measures in hand (including the laying of minefields) to prevent a possible landing onthe East Coast.Evacuation ofSchoolChildren.(previous reference erences:W.M. (40) 138thConclusions,Minute 10, andW.M. (39) 121stConclusions,Minute 2.)11. The Home Secretary recalled that it had been decided to start the evacuation of school children and priority classes fromnineteen ports on the East Coast and South Coast of England on sunday. Consideration was now being given to the evacuation of school children from London and other evacuation areas. TheMinister of Health was due to broadcast that evening invitingparents to register their children before Monday, the 3rd June.The inducement to be held out to parents to register their childrenwas that it might be necessary to start evacuation in the following week, and that those registered by the 3rd June would go first.The question arose whether this drive should proceed orwhether, if invasion was regarded as a possibility in the nearfuture, it would be better to order the evacuation of a proportionof the inhabitants of the East Coast towns. The argument for thelatter course was that, if the inhabitants of these towns remainedwhere they were, or did not move until the country was invaded,they might well interfere with military operations. It would notbe possible to proceed with both schemes simultaneously.The Minister of Health pointed out that hitherto the policy had been not to start evacuation from London until bombing had actually been experienced, but in view of the more recent develop-ments it might be necessary to reconsider this. He himself was infavour of a movement from London, &amp;c, to West Country areas onaccount of the length of time required to move the large numbers involved.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff weredefinitely of opinion that the East Coast evacuation should be given priority over London evacuation.The Lord President of the Council thought that, as London waswell defended, and experience of German methods on the Continentshowed that the enemy preferred to attack small towns and villagesrather than large cities, it was preferable to avoid by evacuationthe serious military difficulties that might be entailed if the east coast were invaded. On the Other hand, the registration of children in London and other evacuation areas in no way committed theGovernment to proceed with the evacuation of children so registeredon any given date.The War Cabinet: Authorised the Home Secretary and the Minister ofHealth to proceed with the existing arrangements,including the broadcast appeal for the registration of school children in London and other evacuation areas, onthe understanding that these arrangements in no wayprejudiced the decision as to the date on which thechildren now registered should be evacuated, or as to the priority between evacuation of children from London, &amp;c,and evacuation of the &quot;useless mouths&quot; from certainEast Coast towns.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 30, 1940.
ANNEX.Telegram, from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to General Weygand(see Minute 1).ORDERS have been sent to Lord Gort that he is to continue to hold his present position as long as possible in order to cover the maximum evacuation of Allied troops. It is clear that the position at Dunkirk cannot be heldindefinitely owing, principally, to the difficulty of keeping the forces theresupplied with food, water and munitions. Policy must therefore be to evacuateand orders to this effect have been given to Lord Gort. I should be glad ifyou would give similar orders to the Senior French Commander in the Dunkirkregion so that he and Lord Gort may be able to act in complete concord. I amsending a copy of this message to Lord Gort.
