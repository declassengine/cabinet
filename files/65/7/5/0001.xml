(40) 94thConclusions,Minute 8.)British AirForces inFrance.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that on the previousSaturday tracks had been observed during the afternoon out to seaoff Yarmouth and Kirkwall, and a reconnaissance had been observedover the Shetlands.The previous day (Sunday) there had been little or no enemy activity in the vicinity of this country.The previous night an enemy aircraft had crossed the coastnear Flamborough Head and had flown over England and the IrishSea, passing over Fleetwood at 11-5 p.m. On its homeward journeyit had reappeared at 1-17 that morning near Whitby.On the previous Saturday night, three Whitley machines had proceeded on security patrols but had been unable to observe any-thing owing to thick haze.. Five Hampdens had successfully carried out a mine-layingreconnaissance over Oslo roads. One of these aircraft had observedsix stationary medium-sized merchant ships.The previous day (Sunday) with the exception of offensive patrols near enemy sea-plane bases in the Heligoland Bight, therehad been no activity on the part of the bomber force. One aircraft on the return journey had observed a number of vessels led by a destroyer. The Admiralty had considered these vessels to be theDutch fishing fleet.A small number of ships had also been observed in the vicinity of List.On the previous Saturday all available aircraft had beenemployed on escort duty with the convoys returning from Namsos,a constant aircraft patrol having been maintained from dawn todusk. An aircraft patrol had also been maintained over a separateconvoy after it had been located about midday.The flying-boats Cabot and Caribou had been heavily attacked by enemy aircraft the previous morning after landing AdmiralLyster and his staff at Harstadt. Five members of the crewhad been wounded and both the boats had had to be beached. Therehad been six casualties but none of them had been fatal.On the previous Saturday, mine-laying reconnaissances hadbeen flown, seven sorties by Swordfish aircraft having been successful. Early on Saturday morning a Hudson on a recon-naissance flight over the Dutch and German coasts had sightedfour medium-sized troop-ships and 20-30 auxiliary vessels at anchorin Norderney Harbour. One large cruiser had been observed outsidethe harbour at anchor.On the previous Saturday a Blenheim machine on strategicalreconnaissance had failed to return.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 112thConclusions,Minute 2.)Britishsubmarineoperations.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the convoy withthe troops from Namsos had now arrived at the Clyde with the lossof the French destroyer Bison and of the destroyer HALS. A fridi.At 1-50 a.m. on the previous morning HAL submarine Seal had reported that she had been damaged by a mine or depth charge andwas filling with water aft. She was proceeding to Gotheborg where she would be interned by the Swedish authorities.H.M. submarine Severn had reported that she had sunk theSwedish ship Monark (1,788 tons) off the Lister Light.   The Master[21256]b 2
had signed a statement to the effect that the ship had been takenby charter at Stavanger and had been forced to proceed to Germany.The crew had been transferred to a power boat in a calm sea and the severn had taken the German prize crew of five on board.H.M. submarine Narwhal had reported that, when in theKattegat on the afternoon of the 1st May, she had sighted anescorted convoy of ten motor vessels, each of about 3,000 tons. she had fired six torpedoes and had heard four definite torpedoexplosions. Ninety-five depth charges had been dropped but theonly damage the Narivhal had sustained was to her periscope.Shipping losses. The British tanker San Tibercio (5,995 tons) had been minedin the Moray Firth the previous evening. All the crew had been saved.Magnetic mines.        Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne were now open to all traffic;also Hartlepool and the Tees, after intense sweeping. Blyth was still closed.One magnetic mine had been exploded in Tees Bay and anothernear Boulogne. Three moored mines had been cut off the Norfolkcoast.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Operations in norway.Narvik.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration present andfuture operations in Norway, and, in particular, operations in the narvik area.The terms of the reply to be sent, to a message received from admiral Lord Cork were agreed upon.w M       n-2tb        ^ detailed record of the discussion and of the conclusions&apos; ,  . reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarConclusions,      Cabinet Conclusions.Minute 3.)(previous reference:Operations in 4.

(40) 112th that it was out of the question to cancel the public debate withoutConclusions,      incurring the most serious political consequences.   All that the minute 10.)       Government could do was to take the greatest care to give no infor-mation which would be of value to the enemy.   In a democraticcountry like ours, criticism was permitted, and the government must meet that criticism.  He thought that the House of commons would accept that position if on any given topic they were told that information could not be given without endangering national security.The Secretary of State for Air thought it likely that theGovernment would be questioned as to their bombing policy. Theproper course, in his view, would be to refuse to give any details onthis subject.The War Cabinet endorsed these views.* CCS. (40) 324.
Portugal. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegrams Nos. 155 and 158 DIPP from His Majesty5sAmbassador, Lisbon, regarding the possibility of a Germanengineered coup d&apos;Etat in Portugal, or of a Spanish attack onPortugal in the interests of Germany and Italy. All these reportscame from French sources, and the Foreign Secretary thought themunduly alarmist.In a recent despatch, Sir Walford Selby had expressed the viewthat these dangers would not become immediate unless and untilItaly joined in the war against us. The Ambassador felt that itwould not be possible for Portugal to comply with our latestrequests in regard to blockade measures without unduly strainingher neutrality. He did not think she would be prepared to do thisunless we decided to assist her and went to the length of landingan expeditionary force in Portugal.The Foreign Secretary added that he proposed shortly to submit to the War Cabinet a paper on Portugal dealing, inter alia, withthe questions of the blockade, and of possible Italian or Spanishaction against that country.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Blockade Policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 77thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. During the discussion recorded in Minute 5, the Secretaryof State for War said that, if Germany was aiming at securingvictory this year at all costs, it might be well that we should reviewour blockade policy vis-a-vis Portugal, Italy, and possibly otherneutrals. While on a long view that policy was sound, it was important to avoid taking action which might force neutral countries into the enemy camp during the coming summer.The Prime Minister said that he also had been impressed bythis possibility, which, as the Foreign Secretary had pointed out,had been raised in telegram No. 53 DIPP from His Majesty&apos;minister at the Vatican.In discussion, it was pointed out that the suggestion thatGermany intended to strain every effort to secure victory this year was only a hypothesis. We could not assume that Germany wouldbe unable to continue the war into the following year, and we ought not to use up resources (e.g., of gold and foreign exchange) whichwe should require if the war continued over a second winter. Again,we must be careful to avoid any course which looked like abandon-ment of the blockade and which might give rise to a feeling thatwe were resigned to the prospect of possible defeat.On the other hand, we had not yet made good many of ourdeficiencies, and we should be in a better position to defeat Germanymilitarily in a year&apos;s time. The real question at issue was a limitedone, namely, was it in our interest to maintain our existing policyduring the next few months, with the risk of irritating opinion in italy, or to effect some modifications in that policy?The Prime Minister suggested that the Foreign secretary should consider the question of our present blockade policy, withspecial reference to Italy, in the light of this discussion.The War Cabinet approved this suggestion.Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 112thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave particulars of the following reports which he had received bearing on theprobable intentions of the Italian Government: According. to the first report, the Minister of ItalianAfrica had stated that the Germans had prepared plans at thebeginning of the war for the invasion of Scandinavia, but theyhad not been anxious to put these into effect. Herr Hitler hadinterpreted a rumour as to extensive Allied preparations in[21256]b 3
Scandinavia as meaning that the Allies themselves intended toattack Scandinavia. He had accordingly taken immediate action to forestall this attack.According to the second report, Wednesday, the17th April, had been the critical day in Italy. signor mussolini had been anxious to enter the war on the side of theGermans and had called a conference of his military advisers,at which Marshal Badoglio and others had been present. their reports on the state of the Italian Army and the lack ofarmaments had persuaded him to change his mind.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.TheMediterranean.Protection ofBritish shipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 109thConclusions,Minute 6.)The netherlands and Belgium.Denial of Dutchaerodromes tothe Germans inthe event of aGerman invasion of Holland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 111thConclusions,Minute 7.)Air action if holland or belgium is invaded.(previous reference:8. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Minister ofShipping had asked him whether diversion of certain classes ofBritish shipping from the Mediterranean should continue. Hesuggested that this matter might be considered at the meeting ofthe War Cabinet to be held the following day.The War Cabinet agreed to this suggestion.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 136 DIPP dated the 4th May, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, The Hague, containing information as to themeasures taken by the Netherland Government to deny aerodromesto the Germans in the event of a German invasion. The information furnished was not very precise; and he proposed to instruct sir nevile Bland to endeavour to obtain further information.The Foreign Secretary raised the question whether any advantage would be gained by informing the Netherland and belgian Governments in advance of the air action which we proposed to take if Germany invaded either of those countries.The Secretary, of State for Air and the Chief of the Air Staff,, , j , ] 1 were opposed to this suggestion, which would give Germany warningConclusion our intentions and would tie our hands as to future action inone conclusions,      contingencies of which the exact nature could not be foreseen.Minute 6.) the War Cabinet agreed That no indication should be given to the Belgian orNetherland Governments regarding the air action whichwe should take in the event of a German invasion of either of those countries.Iceland. 10.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarProposed Cabinet that he had reached the conclusion that we should occupyoccupation. Iceland forthwith, so as to secure it as a base for flying-boats, and(Previous for refuelling the Northern patrol.Reference: Mr. Howard Smith, our Minister-designate, was ready to start&quot;W.M. (40) 87th for Iceland. Either he could inform the Government of Iceland of conclusions, our intentions, and ask for their concurrence, after which a forceMinute 6.)        could be sent; or he could arrive accompanied by a force whichwould immediately take over the essential facilities, while he wasinforming the Government.
The Admiralty favoured the second alternative so as to make certain of forestalling the Germans. If the first alternative were adopted, the Germans might hear of it, and might get into the island with a force conveyed in a very fast ship while negotiations were still in progress, and we should find ourselves faced with another Narvik. A battalion of Marines, with two light field guns,two small coast defence guns, and two light anti-aircraft guns, were ready to sail in a cruiser almost immediately, and could arrivewithin twenty-four hours.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he agreed with the proposal, and also with the suggested procedure. He had consulted Mr. Howard Smith, who had been quite willing to under-take the task of informing the Government of Iceland of a faitaccompli. The main argument against preliminary negotiationswith the Government of Iceland was that they would inevitablyrefuse. This would make the task of subsequently entering by force even more distasteful. A sudden unheralded descent might lead to a formal protest, but would in the long run be less objection-able. A warning would be sent to our Consul, who would arrangein advance an appointment for Mr. Howard Smith with the ForeignMinister at the early hour at which he was expected to arrive. the consul would also arrange for guides, so that parties of Marinescould immediately be taken to the three or four essential places,such as the Post Office, the wireless station, and the house of theGerman Consul.At the interview Mr. Howard Smith would say that we hadtaken note of the desire of Iceland to remain neutral, but had reluctantly decided that the only way in which this could be ensuredwas for us to forestall a German descent, which we felt to beimminent. He would point out that, if the Germans had arrivedfirst, the island would have been turned into a battle-ground,whereas the Germans would be unable to send an expedition toevict our troops. He would give full assurances as to theindependent status of Iceland after the war, and at the same timeindicate our willingness to negotiate on economic matters to their advantage. These would be important to Iceland, but would notcost us much.There was general agreement that this procedure should befollowed, but it was suggested that the small force which would besent initially might not be large enough for the permanent occupa-tion.The War Cabinet (i) Approved the immediate occupation of Iceland by militaryforces, with a view to the establishment of naval and airfacilities.(ii) Agreed that the procedure to be followed in carrying outthe occupation should be as outlined by the foreign secretary in the course of the discussion.(iii) Invited the Chiefs of Staff Committee to consider andreport whether any additional forces would be requiredto ensure the protection of Iceland against german attack.(iv) Agreed in principle that Mr. Howard Smith should have authority to indicate our willingness at once to negotiate with the Icelandic Government an agreement on tradematters which it was anticipated would bring materialadvantages to the inhabitants.
11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer on United Kingdom Coal Exports(W.P. (G.) (40) 125).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the French demands for coal, in peace time 600,000 tons a month, now amounted to2 million tons a month. In informal discussion this demand hadbeen reduced to 1,700,000 tons; but if this amount were not allowedthem, the question would be taken to the Supreme War Council.We had already agreed to exports of 1,500,000 tons a month; andthere was some doubt whether it would be practicable for the french to unload more than this quantity. If an additional 200,000 tons were sent to France we should have (i) to divert large vessels to French Atlantic ports, therebycausing a delay of some ten days in the round voyage;(ii) to restrict our sales to other foreign markets to which theMinister of Economic Warfare, with the support of theForeign Office, attached importance;(iii) to forgo exports for which we should receive foreign currency, to which the Treasury attached the greatest importance;(iv) to reduce the scale of our restocking this summer againstthe anticipated supply difficulties next winter, by allowing only for eight weeks&apos; supplies to be held by public utility companies in the place of the ten weeks&apos;supplies now contemplated.His own conclusion was that the French demand could not be metso long as production remained at its present rate of 245 million tons a year. He suggested therefore that we should offer theFrench exports at the rate of 1,500,000 tons a month, together withthe greater part of any excess of our disposable output above itspresent rate, up to a further 200,000 tons a month. The onlysatisfactory remedy lay in an increase in our coal output. It wouldbe impossible to return the French a flat refusal.The Lord Privy Seal supported the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s proposal.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in view of thedifficulties which our coastal shipping was likely to encounter next winter, he viewed with alarm the proposal to reduce our rate ofaccumulation of stocks. The French must have the coal required fortheir war effort; but it might be necessary to reduce our otherexports of coal, which though large in bulk brought us in a corn-par atively small return.The Minister without Portfolio referred to the need to buildup stocks against the contingency of diversion of shipping fromthe East Coast.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that in the last war coal production had declined. It would not be safe to bankon an increase in output. In his view the steps being taken byLord Portal&apos;s Committee to increase production were on the rightlines.The Secretary for Mines said that the present estimate of anannual output of coal of 245 million tons was based on the currentweekly rate of 4-8 million tons. Serious-efforts to increase outputhad become possible only in the previous three weeks, since before that it had been impossible to dispose of all the coal which could have been raised, either because of shipping difficulties, or becauseof the interference with transport caused by the bad weather.Coal.Exports toFrance.(previous references:W.M.

U.S.S.R.trade negotiations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 109thConclusions,Minute 7.)12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked forthe authority of the War Cabinet to complete the draft reply toM. Maisky in regard to our proposed trade negotiations with theTJ.SiS.Ei., in consultation with the other Ministers concerned inparticular, the President of the Board of Trade. The matter was somewhat urgent; not only would it be necessary to consult theFrench Government, but it would be desirable to be in a position togive a reply in Parliament on Wednesday, the 8th May. Subjectto the concurrence of the French Government, the reply would beto the effect that, provided the U.S.S.R. were willing to give usassurances on certain points of interest to the Minister of economic warfare, we should be prepared to enter into negotiations withthem for a trade agreement.The War Cabinet-Agreed to authorise the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, after consultation with- the other ministers concerned, to decide upon the text of the Note to be handed to M. Maisky in reply to the recent Note* received fromthe U.S.S.R. on the subject of the opening of negotiationsfor a trade agreement.* Enclosure to F.O. Despatch No. 204, dated 29th April, 1940, to HisMajesty&apos;s Representative, Moscow.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 6, 1940.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that it might bedesirable to consider the appointment of a small Committee toconsider the various methods of increasing the output of coal.The War Cabinet-Agreed that we should offer to supply the French with1,500,000 tons of coal a month for export to France andthe French Colonial Empire, together with the greater partof any additional quantity of coal (up to a further200,000 tons a month) which might become available through (a) an expansion of output above its present level of48 million tons a week; or(b) a decision to aim at stocks of 8 instead of 10 weeks&apos;supplies for Public Utilities.
