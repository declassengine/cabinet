383 W.M.156(40).1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that 134 raids had beep,plotted on the previous night between the Orkneys and the south coast, and bombs had been dropped in several places, includingaerodromes. Very little damage had been done and casualties were very few. No interceptions had been made by our fighters. Theenemy had also laid mines near Portsmouth.Details were given of the operations of 23 Blenheim aircraftagainst troop concentrations near Albert during the evening of the5th June. A fighter escort with this formation had lost touchwith it, and the bombers had encountered enemy fighters. All had returned safely, however, and reported that one enemy fighter hadbeen shot down near Etaples.Ninety-eight heavy bombers had been operating on the previous night, of which 48 had been employed on enemy movements in the battle area, and 8 on marshalling yards, at the request of the French.Two of these bombers had failed to return.Mines had been dropped in the Little Belt and near Flushingby 6 heavy bombers, while 36 others had attacked oil targets.One enemy aircraft had been brought down by balloon barrageat Havre early on the 4th June, and one of our aircraft had alsobeen destroyed by a balloon cable on its return to this country earlythat morning.The Secretary of State for Air gave details of the operations of the British Air Forces in France on the previous day. four enemy aircraft (certain), and possibly five more, had been brought down, at a cost of one of our own aircraft and four damaged. one enemy aircraft had been brought down by anti-aircraft fire atRouen. Included in the enemy losses was a Dornier 17, which hadbeen escorted by considerable numbers of fighters. Judging by the size of the escort this aircraft might have contained a person ofsome importance.In answer to a question by the Lord President of the Council,the Secretary of State said that the Air Staff were examining thepossibility of air operations to interfere with Germany&apos;s oil supplies from Roumania. The distances involved were very long and theoperation would be difficult owing to the shortness of the nights.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 155thConclusions,Minute 3.)The MilitarySituation.The WesternPront.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 155thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that in the battle which had begun the previous day between Anizy and the mouth of the Somme German armoured formations had penetratedin some places to a depth of 10 or 12 miles, but the French strong-points appeared to be holding out. The French were counter-attacking and were taking energetic measures to form reserves.Details of these reserves were given. The French had about 72divisions in all on this front. The British 51st Division had been forced to give ground after a heavy attack supported by dive-bombers.   This division was holding a very wide front.Generally speaking, the position seemed more satisfactory than we had expected. There were no signs yet of large enemy armouredformations. The enemy was probably testing the strength of thefront all along before launching his main attack.The Prime Minister said that General Spears reported animprovement in the tone of the French Command, who seemed to begaining more confidence. If the fighting developed into old-styleinfantry battles,-the Germans might not relish the prospect of pressing home their attacks.[21391] B 2

(40) 153rdConclusions,Miuute 7.)4. The First Sea Lord said that work on all ships in the Malta,dockyard was being accelerated as much as possible in order thatthey might be cleared out before Italy entered the war. Onemonitor would remain moored at Malta to supplement the coast defences.The First Lord of the Admiralty read a telegram received fromthe Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, expressing his concern atthe clanger of an Italian attack on the island. He was anxiousto obtain a fighter squadron to supplement the defences.In discussion it was pointed out that owing to the very substantial construction of the houses in Malta and the presenceof numerous cellars and tunnels in the rock, the civilian population would have a high degree of protection against air attack. the infantry garrison in the island now amounted to five Regularbattalions. The military Commander, General Dobbie, could be relied upon to put up a stubborn defence. The fighters which werebeing sent out to the Mediterranean would be of much more use to the Fleet at Alexandria than at Malta.The Secretary of State for Air said that the ground staff werearriving in the aerodromes in southern France on the 10th June.Bomber squadrons might be able to operate from these aerodromes in northern Italy by the night 9th-10th June.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that arrangements hadbeen made whereby one Fleet Air Arm Training Squadron atHyeres could undertake a limited part in such operations or in&quot; gardening.&quot; He drew attention to a report which had beenreceived that further Italian aircraft had been despatched to Libya.The Italian aircraft carrier Maraglia had made a second trip.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Norway.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet were given a further report on thesubject of the situation in Norway, a record of which is containedin the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
Italy.contraband control.(previous reference:Minute 1.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to thedecision taken by the War Cabinet the previous day that italian ships carrying provocative cargoes of key war materials to Italy,as shown in the list prepared by the Ministry of Economic Warfare,should be intercepted and made subject to contraband control. LaterW M &quot;(40) 155th that day, the question had been further examined both in the ForeignConclusions Office and in the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Most of the shipson the list were carrying cargoes such as fuel oil, which the ItalianGovernment would claim were destined for Government use. BothDepartments thought that it would be more logical, and likely to cause less indignation in Italy, if we were now to revert to theposition as it existed before the 23rd May last (i.e., to subject tocontraband control all Italian ships whether inward or outward bound) than if we were to single out certain ships for interception.Apart from Italian ships, the only other ships not now subject tocontraband control, were ships flying the United States flag. he did not now propose that any action should be taken against such ships; in any event no such action would be taken without prior consulation with the United States Government.The Minister for Economic Warfare supported the proposal ofthe Foreign Secretary that the scope of the decision taken by theWar Cabinet on the previous day, should be extended and that orders should be made to apply contraband control to all shipsflying the Italian flag, whether bound to or from Italy.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the Secretary ofState for Foreign A ffairs said that he had kept Lord Lothian fullvinformed of the action proposed to be taken; he would now telegraph to him again, instructing him to explain the position to president roosevelt.The War Cabinet: (a) Agreed that the decision taken the previous day to intercept and subject to contraband control certain specified ships flying the Italian flag, should be extendedto cover all Italian ships whether inward bound oroutward bound from Italy.(b) Took note that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsintended to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Washington, to explain to President Roosevelt why wehad thought it necessary to take this action.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,June 6, 1940.
