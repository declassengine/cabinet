The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that themilitary reinforcements and aircraft from the United Kingdom had now reached Iceland.Our patrols near Karsde had had several very satisfactoryencounters with the enemy.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that his enquiries intothe circumstances in which wide publicity had been given to the carrying out of raids on the coast of France, showed that the releaseof the information to the Press had been made on the initiative ofthe Adjutant-General, Royal Marines, who was the officer in chargeof the operations. He (the First Lord) had personally impressed on this officer the unfortunate results of this publicity.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The Naval 3.

United States of 4. The Secretary of State for War informed the War CabinetAmerica. that on the 21st June, General Nogues had asked for certain warAllied purchases material to be shipped direct from New York to Casablanca. Theof arms. position was that we had taken over the French interest in Alliedcontracts, and also contracts for exclusively French requirements,placed in the United States. It had been arranged that the material for which General Nogues had asked should be loaded in a separateship, and put into a British convoy, the destination of which wecould control from here. Orders had now been given that this material should be brought to a United Kingdom port. Our interestin the matter had therefore been safeguarded.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.France.French armed forces in the united kingdom.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 184thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Prime Minister said that at a meeting the previous afternoon, it had been agreed that it was desirable to remove fromthis country as soon as possible all French personnel who did notvolunteer to remain and carry on the fight. It was proposed tosend them to North African ports in French ships. But it had since been pointed out that if we used French ships, they would be detained on reaching North Africa. It might therefore be better to use British ships. We could not afford to wait for French ships to be sent specially to this country to take back the troops.The War Cabinet were informed that there would be about20,000 men to transport. The first ship would be ready to leavethat night with some 1,500 men.There was general agreement that special measures should betaken in respect of the French wounded. Those who were fit to travel should if possible be sent back direct to France; the more serious would, of course, continue to be cared for in this country.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that a desirable contact could be maintained with the French government over the question of repatriating the wounded.The War Cabinet-(a) Took note that arrangements were being made to send to north Africa, as soon as possible, the French armed forces in the United Kingdom, other than those whovolunteered to stay and continue the fight.(&amp;) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to com-municate with the French Government regarding there patriation of French wounded who were fit to travel,and to suggest that they should be sent direct to ports in France, provided that a guarantee could be obtainedfrom the Germans that ships carrying them would beallowed to return safely to this country.France.TheSmile Bertinand Beam.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 184thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Chief of Naval Staff said that the Beam had reachedMartinique. The Manager of the Bank of Poland was not on boardthis ship, or the Emile Bertin. It therefore seemed probable thatthe gold on board the latter ship which was now being unloaded atMartinique was not Polish gold.
France- 7-   The War Cabinet were given certain further information        &amp; \\ 1The French       m regard to the French Fleet.   This is recorded in the Secretary&apos;sFleet. Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 184thConclusions, -Minute 5.)aircraft.France. 8.   The Secretary of State for Air asked for authority toDetention of detain and requisition for our own use French civil aircraft on french civil      the air lines plying over British territory.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that itwould suffice to detain any French aircraft which would be in aposition, if not detained, to escape from our control into territorycontrolled by the enemy or by the Bordeaux Government. Thiswould involve, e.g., preventing French aircraft from moving up thewest coast of Africa, or leaving Egypt. Aircraft of the Air Franceline operating in India, however, need not be submitted to any restrictions.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for Air, in consultation, to concert thenecessary instructions to prevent French civil aircraft nowin British territory from escaping from our control toterritory controlled by the enemy or by the BordeauxGovernment.France.Service aircraft and pilots in north Africa.9. The Chief of the Air Staff said that an officer had been sentto Algiers to try and get French Service aircraft and pilots throughWest Africa to the Sudan. This officer had been ordered to leavethe country by the French authorities. He had suggested that heshould be disavowed by the British Government and allowed tocontinue his activities as a free lance.The Prime Minister directed that should be deferred until later in&apos; the day.decision on this pointFrance. 10.   The War Cabinet had before them Situation in (i) A Eeport by the Minister of Information on his visit toAlgeria and French Morocco (W.P. (40) 225).French Morocco.        (jj) A Memorandum by the Minister of Information proposingcertain action to be taken in Morocco (W.P. (40) 226).Visit of the The Minister of Information said that MM. Mandel, Daladier,Minister of       Delbos and Campinchi were virtually prisoners in a ship now atInformation.      Casablanca.   They were anxious to get to England, but wouldcertainly not be allowed to sail by the French authorities.Some discussion followed on the desirability of getting theseFrench Ministers to England. It was pointed out that one or twomight form the nucleus of an alternative French Government, butthe inclusion of, for example, M. Daladier would be likely to prejudice any success. It might be possible to get away the shipcontaining the French Ministers at the same time as any of theFrench warships in the port.
Attitude of The Minister of Information said that the Spanish General atSpain. Algeciras had called upon him to emphasise that Spain had nohostile intentions at all. It appeared that the Spaniards werenervous of an attack by us to seize the mainland adjoining Gibraltar.The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to examine and report on theproposals of the Minister of Information for an expeditionary force to Morocco contained in W.P. (40)226.(ii) Agreed  that,  provided the  success of any operationsdesigned to obtain control of the French Fleet were notthereby prejudiced, it would be desirable to get the shipcontaining the French Ministers now at Casablancaaway from the port, with a view to their transport toEngland.11. The Secretary of State for War said that under the termsof the Franco-Italian armistice the Italians were to take over controlof DJibuti. It was most important to prevent this from happening.He read a telegram which had been received from General Wavellreporting that General le Gentilhomme, the French General atDJibuti, was maintaining a firm front. General Wavell proposedto take all possible steps to maintain French resistance at Djibuti.If, however, this resistance should collapse, he wished to beauthorised to take steps to prevent Djibuti from falling into Italianhands.The Secretary of State for War said that if we took over thedefence of Djibuti it would be necessary to send additional Britishtroops there. He would like to send a telegram to General Wavell,giving approval for such action as might be necessary to upholdGeneral le Gentilhomme, or to prevent Djibuti falling into the handsof the Italians.The War Cabinet approved the issue of instructions toGeneral Wavell on these lines.Egypt. 12.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that(Previous King Farouk had now invited Hassan Sabri Pasha to form a reference:        Cabinet (telegram 623 from Cairo).   This would be satisfactory,W.M. (40) 178th provided Nahas Pasha was willing to support him.     Sir MilesConclusions,      Lampson was informing King Farouk that if Sabri was to be PrimeMinute 9.) &apos;      Minister it was essential that he should have the support of theWafd.     Failing such support, it would be necessary to bring pressure to bear on the King to accept either Nahas or a nominee ofNahas as Prime Minister.   Although matters in Egypt were notmoving fast, the position was not unsatisfactory.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theRoumanian Minister had informed him that his Governmenthad appointed delegates to confer with the Russians on their demands for Bessarabia and part of the Bukovina. M. Tilea had promised to keep us informed of further developments.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that theRussians might be endeavouring to stake out a claim in Roumaniaahead of the Germans. He thought it more likely, however, thatthe move had been made in collusion with Germany and Italy.FrenchSomaliiand.Future ofDjibuti.(previous reference:W.M.

South Africa.Telegram fromGeneral Smuts.14. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 329 from General Smuts to the Prime Minister, inwhich reference was made to the possibility that Germany would now use her land forces against Africa. This reinforced the needfor ensuring that the Prench Fleet did not fall into the hands ofthe enemy.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theDominion High Commissioners were emphatic that we should take steps to prevent Germany getting hold of the French Fleet.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet an extract fromthe interim reply which he had sent to General Smuts, and directed that these telegrams should be circulated to the War Cabinet.SelectCommittee onNationalExpenditure.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 72ndConclusions,Minute 6.)Scope of its activities.15. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat a Sub-Committee of the Parliamentary Committee on expenditure under the Chairmanship of Sir John Wardlaw-Milne,which dealt with Army affairs, was extending the scope of itsenquiries and examining shortages of equipment. He had beenasked to allow Lord Gort to give evidence before this Sub-Committee.The Prime Minister said that he had already spoken to sir john Wardlaw-Milne, who had urged that his Committee was doingvaluable work, although perhaps outside its terms of reference, in bringing matters to the notice of Ministers. Pie had told Sir Johnthat he was not prepared to extend the terms of reference of thisCommittee to deal with questions of efficiency for which a differentlyconstituted body would be required. Nevertheless, if in the courseof the Committee&apos;s enquiries into expenditure, particular cases ofinefficiency came to light, he would be glad to receive a short reporton the matter. A period of intense activity such as the present,however, was not the time to conduct detailed enquiries of this nature, which would take officers with heavy responsibilities away from their proper duties. The request that Lord Gort should attendbefore the Committee should therefore be refused on the grounds,not only that an enquiry into shortages was outside the terms ofreference of the Committee, but also that the time of high officerscould not be taken up in such enquiries at the present juncture.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War to see Sir JohnWardlaw-Milne and reply to his request on the lines proposed by the Prime Minister.Army 16.   The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theExpansion. Secretary of State for War and the President of the Board of proposed use of Education (W.P. (G.) (40) 161 and 163) on a proposal that thePublic Schools.   Public Schools should be used to provide accommodation for trainingmen for the army.In the course of discussion the following were the principalpoints made : (1) Under present conditions, our ideas of what waseducationally desirable must necessarily be revised.(2) The President of the Board of Education said that thePublic Schools were anxious to play their part in meetingthe army&apos;s needs at the present time; but that to take all their accommodation right through to the summer of1941 would mean that 60,000 boys would be deprived of all opportunities for Secondary Education, as placescould not be found for them in other schools.
There was general agreement that the proposal inthis particular form should not be approved except as a last resort and in the absence of any satisfactory alternative.(3) In addition to other alternatives, special attention was drawn to the accommodation which would become avail-able in coast towns as a result of the evacuation of alarge proportion of the population.(4) The Secretary of State for War said that all alternativeswere being considered, but the proposal to use the publis schools had the advantage of providing the quickest andeasiest way of meeting a very urgent need. It wouldcertainly not be worth while to use them merely urftilthe end of September, and he was doubtful whether itwould be worth while to take them only until the endof October, but he would make further enquiries on thispoint.(5) The Prime Minister said that special consideration shouldbe given also to the position at the Universities. Apartfrom the useful accommodation that they would provide,it was most unsatisfactory that the young men now atthe Universities should not be receiving any militarytraining.The Secretary of State for War said that plans were underconsideration for forming Home Defence Battalions at the universities and for using their accommodation for army purposes.It would be necessary to ensure that there was no interference withUniversity work of national importance on the scientific andtechnical sides. On this and other points there would be full con-sultation with the University authorities before any scheme was put into force.The War Cabinet :-(i) Invited the Secretary of State for War and the Presidentof the Board of Education to consider further (a) whether it was in the public interest that the accommodation of the Public Schools or some part thereof should&apos; be used for army purposes untilthe end of October 1940; and(b) arrangements  for  making  the  best  use  of  the universities for military purposes;and to report to the Lord President of the Council.(ii) Invited the Lord President of the Council, after settlingany outstanding points, to report on these two matters to the War Cabinet.Position of the universities.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 28, 1940.
