3 D 6The air situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 181stConclusions,Minute 8.)fighter command.bomber command.1. The Chief of the Air Staff gave the War Cabinet a brief account of air operations during the previous 24 hours which may-be summarised as follows : coastal command.Air raids on great Britain.Offensive patrols over aerodromes near French coast. ThreeMesserschmitt 109&apos;s shot down, and three others probably destroyed.All aircraft returned.By day oil targets, an iron foundry and aerodromes in Hollandbombed.  All aircraft returned.By night 58 bombers attacked aluminium works, oil refineries,aircraft factories and marshalling yards.  All aircraft returned.Operations on night 24:th-25th June.Reports showed that attacks during night 24th-25th June hadbeen very successful. Direct hits had been observed and numerousfires started.Reconnaissance of Stavanger and Bergen. Merchant ships andone destroyer seen at Stavanger, merchant ships only at Bergen.Tanker bombed and possibly damaged.The Scharnhorst was presumed to have returned to Germany.On the previous night 143 raids had been plotted over GreatBritain from the south coast to Aberdeen. Enemy aircraft appearedto have approached the United Kingdom from three differentdirections from France towards Portsmouth, from Hollandtowards the centre of England and from Norway towards Scotland.Bombs had been dropped over a wide area, but little damage caused;casualties had on by been slight. Oil tanks had been set on fire nearNewport, and hits had been made on two aerodromes. Preliminaryreports claimed five enemy aircraft shot down. One Spitfire wasmissing.Discussion followed on the effects on production of large partsof the country being under the &apos;&apos; Red &apos;&apos; warning for several hourson three successive nights.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister without Portfolio, in consultationwith the Minister of Home Security, the Minister ofSupply and the Minister for Aircraft Production, to reportto the War Cabinet on the effect on production, resultingfrom the &apos;&apos; Red &apos;&apos; warnings during the past week, and tomake recommendations for improving the situation.The air situation:Middle East.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 181stConclusions,Minute 8.)Air reinforce-ments for theMiddle Bast.2. The Chief of the Air Staff said that small scale offensive operations continued with success. The Italians were extremelyreluctant to fight.   One of our aircraft was missing.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked whether steps could be taken to replace the air reinforcements for Egypt whichhad been lost on passage.The Chief of the Air Staff said that steps would continue tobe taken to reinforce and re-equip the Air Forces in the Middle[21466] b 2
East, which already had ample reserves. If necessary equipment would be sent via the Cape. Every effort was being made to obtainthe American aircraft from Casablanca for the Middle East.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The MilitarySituation.Middle East.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 181stConclusions,Minute 5.)The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 181stConclusions,Minute 10.)U-boat attacks.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that themilitary operations in the Middle East confirmed the reluctance of the Italians to fight. In recent raids at Kassala Italian forces had sustained considerable losses, while our forces had not suffered a single casualty.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Swedishdestroyers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 181stConclusions,Minute 6.)France.The french fleet.(previous reference&quot;.W.M. (40) 182ndConclusions,Minute 2.)France.The EmileBertin.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 181stConclusions,Minute 10.)4. The Chief of Naval Staff reported that evacuation in the st. Jean de Luz area had been completed and that, while makinga sweep for the crippled French M.V. de la Salle, the Canadiandestroyer Fraser had collided with Calcutta and been cut in half.There were 130 survivors.The Chief of Naval Staff gave further particulars of german-boat attacks on merchant shipping during the past three days,including the sinking of the Norwegian S.S. Randsfjord, which hadbeen sunk in convoy off Cobh, and two British tankers, and the S.S.Windsor Wood, torpedoed in convoy 500 miles South-west of Land&apos;sEnd.The four Swedish destroyers, with their depot ship and tanker,had assembled at Kirkwall for onward passage.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.5. The War Cabinet were given the latest information asregards the French Fleet. The discussion and conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.6. The Chief of Naval Staff said that the French cruiserEmile Bertin had arrived at Martinique. H.M.S. Dunedin wasalso at Martinique, and H.M.S. Fiji, a faster and more powerfulcruiser, would reach Martinique late that day.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the PolishAmbassador had represented that the bullion on board the Frenchcruiser might include certain Polish gold which the French Govern-ment had undertaken to ship. This development made it easier forus to take strong action to prevent the Emile Bertin from leavingMartinique until the position as to the ownership of the gold onboard had been cleared up.  This was agreed to.The War Cabinet Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty and the foreign secretary to consult as to the instructions to be sent to the captain of HALS. Fiji.
Plans forcertain Frenchpoliticians.7. The Secretary of State for War referred to a telegramfrom No. 8 Military Mission, reporting an interview with GeneralMittelhauser, in which the latter had stressed the difficulties withwhich he was faced, and asked for an assurance that Great Britaindid not intend to take Syria after the war. (Cypher telegramNo. 630 25/6.) A reassuring reply had been sent after consultationwith the Foreign Office.The Secretary of State for War also referred to telegramNo. 631 25/6 from No. 8 Military Mission suggesting that a state-ment should be made either that a new French Government wasbeing formed to continue the war, or authorising the French forces to join the British Navy, Army and Air Force. The War Officereply had authorised the Mission to state that all French forces could count on full political and financial support of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and that such forces would be welcome if they wishedto be incorporated in the British forces.The Secretary of State for War read a telegram from theDillon Mission at Algiers to the effect that General Nogues wouldnot believe the published terms of the Armistice with Italy. Hehad refused to meet Mr. Duff Cooper and Lord Gort, and it wasvery doubtful whether there was anybody in North Africa capableof starting an independent Government there.It seemed clear that, subject to what the Minister of Informa-tion and Lord Gort could achieve, little hope was to be expected from General Nogues, who appeared to think that, so long as noFrench territory was ceded to Italy, it did not matter whether the demilitarised portions of the French Empire were at the mercy ofthe enemy. The half-hearted attitude adopted in General Nogues&apos;sproclamation, which had been published in the press, gave littlepromise of resistance in North Africa.The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention toCasablanca telegrams Nos. 91 and 92, dated the 25th June,reporting that M. Campinchi, M. Daladier and M. Delbos had stated that they were awaiting the Italian armistice terms before deciding whether they would stay in North Africa. If not, they wished to leave immediately for England together with some30 parliamentarians and others, and they had inquired whethertransport was available.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the inquiry could not be answered until the Minister of information had reported on the results of his Mission. If the Frenchpoliticians could do no good by remaining in North Africa, weshould presumably do our best to provide them with a passage tothis country.A temporising reply should be sent, asking for the views ofthe Minister of Information and the Consul-General, and sayingthat, if they both favoured this course, we should be ready to supplytransport.The War Cabinet agreed with this suggestion.France.Attitude ofFrench naval officers.8. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a Frenchcapitaine de corvette at Falmouth had asserted that there was astrong feeling among French Naval Officers in favour of continuing the fight against Germany. He had spoken contemptuously ofFrench politicians as a whole, and had said that feeling would runhigh amongst his brother-officers if there were any attempt toinclude French politicians in the French National Committee.The view was expressed that, whatever the sentiments of individual officers, there was very little hope that the French Navyas a whole would continue the fight.[21466] b 3Position inFrenchColonies.(previous reference: ..W.M. (40) 182ndConclusions,Minute 4.)
Suggested The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had receivedbroadcast by a from the Chairman of the Anglo-French Co-ordinating CommitteeFrench naval the draft of a statement by an unnamed French Naval Officer inofficer. London, which it was proposed should be broadcast.The War Cabinet-Decided that, while a broadcast by a senior French officermight well be of value, a broadcast by an unnamed or veryjunior officer would serve no useful purpose.France.French oil supplies.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 181stConclusions,Minute 11.)9. The Chief of the Air Staff enquired whether bombing attacks could be carried out on oil supplies in German-occupied territory.The War Cabinet-Agreed that such attacks could be carried out on oil supplies in parts of France which had been occupied bythe Germans and where the Germans were using the aerodromes. (In practice, this might mean that at thepresent time attacks could be carried out on oil supplies in territory north of, say, the Loire, but not, for example,in the Bordeaux area.)France.Armed forces inthe UnitedKingdom.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 179thConclusions,Minute 5.)10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the morale of the French troops in this country was deteriorating.Several men in the Foreign Legion had been put in custody asCommunists by their General, who had wished to shoot three ofthem. A request had been received that these troops should be sentto North Africa. It was proposed to let them go,-with their personalarms, but to retain in this country any artillery or tanks with these units.It was pointed out that if these troops were sent to north africa in French ships now in this country, we should lose controlof these ships. It was suggested that it might be possible to persuade the French Government to send shipping from Frenchterritories to take away these troops.The War Cabinet Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to make enquiries,in consultation with the other Departments concerned, asto the shipping arrangements proposed for the transport to North Africa of the French troops now in this country;and postponed a final decision pending the submission ofthis report.Spain.Attitude ofSpanishGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 178thConclusions,Minute 4.)Gibraltar.11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto two telegrams from Madrid.In a conversation on the 22nd June, General Franco had shown a friendly disposition and had repeated the assurances as to Spanishnon-belligerency which the Ambassador had previously receivedfrom the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs. (Telegram No. 403,dated the 22nd June.)Neither General Franco nor the Minister for Foreign affairs had specifically raised the question of Gibraltar. The Ambassador,however, suggested for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment that, as events were moving quickly, it might be wise to tell the Spanish Government that while we would not discuss the futureof Gibraltar during the war, we would discuss it with them at the
tJ j oend of the war. The Ambassador suggested that this might besaid in the course of general conversation, not in a special interview.He (the Foreign Secretary) would raise the point when the PrimeMinister was present.The AVar Cabinet took note of the above statement.Germany. 12.   The Foreign Secretary drew the attention of his colleaguesPossible to the following telegrams containing reports from various sourcesintentions.        Qf Germany&apos;s intentions : Belgrade telegram No. 385. The German General staff had had to &quot; change their plans about invasions of the UnitedKingdom,&quot; in view of the fighting qualities of the Britishtroops and the success at the Dunkirk evacuation; this did notnecessarily indicate the abandonment of the intention to invade.Bucharest telegram No. 564. Hitler would in the nearfuture make a determined effort to break British morale by theuse of some new weapon. Invasion was not contemplated. if that failed he would let it be known -that for every bombdropped in Germany, ten would be dropped in Great Britain,and would await developments.In about three weeks&apos; time he would call a conference ofall European countries, Russia being invited to send an observer, and Turkey being excluded, to draw up a new statute of Europe.Berne telegram No. 260, Hitler intended very shortly to convene a European Economic Conference.A Polish informant had given the 8th July as the date for the invasion of Great Britain.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The Far East.Immediatedefencemeasures.13. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Report bythe Chiefs of Staff on Immediate Measures required in the Far East(W.P. (40) 222).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs commented on therecommendations in the Report as follows : (6) The United States of America had declined to make any declaration about their policy in the Far East, and littlecould be expected of them.(c), (d) and (e) The Foreign Office had been urging that the WarOffice should take up the question of recruiting Britishsubjects for service with military forces in the Far East.He agreed that the two British Battalions should remain at Shanghai for the moment.   The Foreign Office would shortly be consulting the Chiefs of Staff on the general question of our policy towards Japan.The Foreign Office were prepared to accept the advice of theauthorities on the spot regarding the evacuation of HongKong.The Report did not refer to Indo-China, but this did not affectthe issue before the War Cabinet.The following were the main points made in discussion : (i) The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that about,000 women and children would have to be evacuated from Hong Kong. Those of United States nationalitywould go to Manila, and the rest would go to Fremantle.(/)(g)
(ii) The Secretary of State for the Colonies had discussed thedefence of Singapore with Sir Shenton Thomas, who had strongly urged the provision of air defence.It was feared that no further squadrons could bemade available beyond the two squadrons from australia.(iii) As regards land defence, Sir Shenton Thomas had saidto the Secretary of State for the Colonies that 8 of the10 or 12 aerodromes would require guarding, and thatone Division was necessary for the purpose.(iv) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought that paragraph 2 of the draft telegram to Australia was inconsistent with the arguments which had been used inNovember, 1939, to induce Australia and New zealand to release their land forces to fight in Europe. He wouldlike to see this paragraph amplified so as to give a fullerexplanation of the changes in the Naval situation.(v) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was confident that Australia would send one Division, as asked inparagraph 5; but as we were asking Australia to sendthis Division with as much equipment as could be madeavailable, we ought, in fairness to them, to let themknow the nature of the attack likely to be encountered.(vi) The Lord Privy Seal said that the Report raised thewhole question of our position in Asia. This included the attitude of India and Burma to the war, and theinterest of the United States of America in Indianaffairs. He hoped that in the near future the WarCabinet would find time to discuss our whole position inthe Ear East.This suggestion met with approval.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the despatch to the Government of Australia ofa telegram on the lines of Annex I, subject to para-graphs 2 and 5 being re-drafted by the Chiefs of Staff,in consultation with the Dominions Office.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to take up, as amatter of urgency, the question of recruiting. Britishsubjects in the Far East.(3) Agreed that steps should now be taken to evacuate Britishwomen and children from Hong Kong.PossibleInvasion ofGreat Britain.Co-ordination of demands for air reconnaissance.14. The Secretary of State for War raised the question of theco-ordination of demands for reconnaissance, in particular air reconnaissance. This had assumed great importance owing to possible invasion. The Joint Intelligence Committee collated theinformation as to the possibilities of invasion, but it was not clearwho was responsible for deciding, in the light of this information,what should be the object and scope of future reconnaissance. a corollary to this was the need for making sure that, in the event ofreconnaissance establishing that an invading force was beingassembled, the necessary machinery was in being which would orderimmediate attack.The Chief of the Air Staff said that there was already a schemefor anti-invasion air reconnaissance which covered defined areasof the coast. He recognised, however, the importance attached tothe rapid investigation by air reconnaissance of reports of enemy concentrations portending invasion.
The Lord President of the Council said that it was vital thatsome authority should be made responsible for keeping a constantand continuous watch for the possibility of invasion.The War Cabinet-Requested the Chiefs of Staff to report to the War Cabineton the following points : (a) The means at our disposal for obtaining informationof an intended German invasion :(b) The method of collating and disseminating informationwhen received, ana the authority responsible for deciding upon the scale and scope of further recon-naissance :(c) The machinery for taking action on reports of enemy concentrations of troops, ships or aircraft,indicating that invasion was imminent, so that, ifpossible, these concentrations could be attackedforthwith.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.June 26, 1940.
