Belgium. 1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs said that he hadBelgian request received a Note from the Belgian Ambassador asking for anfor British and assurance that, in the event of the Germans bombing the civilianFrench population of Belgium (&quot;en cas de bombarclement de la populationassurances as to civile Beige &quot;), His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Govern-air action. ment would act in the same manner as they would act if the Britishand French civilian populations were bombed.The Belgians had addressed a similar Note to the FrenchGovernment.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been informed by theFrench Ambassador that his Government had decided : (a) to return a favourable answer to the Belgian request;(&amp;) to suspend action until His Majesty&apos;s Governments views were known (that is, to hold up the French reply to theBelgian Note until the French Government had heard from us).In the course of the Meeting, various messages were received and read out, giving information as to the extent and nature of the bombing attacks carried out by the enemy. This information is recorded in Minute 2.In discussion, the following points were made :(1) The Secretary of State for A ir thought that we ought to accede to the Belgian request. We were only asked tosay that we would regard the bombing of the Belgianpopulation in the same light as the bombing of our ownpopulation, and not what measures we would take in either case. The operations which the War Cabinet hadalready authorised the Royal Air Force to undertakethat night would be in no way inconsistent with ourreturning a simple affirmative answer to the Belgianrequest.(2) The Prime Minister asked as to the exact meaning of :&apos;&apos; en cas de bombardement de la population civile Beige.&apos;&apos;Did it cover cases of bombing of civilians which wereincidental to attack on a military target, as well as casesof deliberate bombing % The essential thing was not to do anything which could render us liable to be accused of having initiated unrestricted air bombing. Prima faciethe reply to the Belgian Government ought to include a reference to any authoritative reports which wereavailable of civilians having been killed by German air action since the opening of that morning&apos;s offensive, andto say that our conduct in this matter would be regulated by that of Germany.The War Cabinet:(i) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to tell the French and belgian Ambassadors at once that a favourable answer was about to be returned to the Belgian request.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State forAir to settle the terms of the draft reply after theMeeting, in the light of the above discussion.Note.-After the Meeting, information was received that theFrench Government proposed to issue a Proclamation inthe following terms : &quot; The French Government, which in its reply ofthe 1st September to the appeal of the President of theUnited States gave the assurance that its air forces had  received  orders prohibiting  the bombing  of
civilian populations and limiting bombing to strictly military objectives, now publicly proclaims that itreserves to itself the right to take any action whichit considers appropriate in the event of bombing bythe enemy of civil populations, whether in France, theUnited Kingdom, or in countries assisted by France.&quot;The Ministers referred to in Conclusion (ii) agreed thatthe French Government should be informed that we wouldissue a Proclamation in similar terms to theirProclamation.Air Action.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 117thConclusions.)German actionin France,Holland andBelgium.2. The following information was given to the War Cabinetin the course of the Meeting, as to the bombing attacks carried outby the enemy : -(1) The Chief of the Air Staff said that his informationsuggested that the French Government were likely toask that the British Air Striking Force should not atpresent open air attacks on objectives in Germany. TheFrench appeared to be putting it out that up to thepresent time the German Air Force had confined their operations to aerodromes and other strictly military objectives. On the information so far received, this appeared to be a more or less correct statement of theposition. The towns so far bombed were all on theFrench lines of communication.(2) Later it was stated that the following official announce-ment had been made by the French through the HavasAgency : &apos;&apos; A certain number of towns, among themopen towns, Nancy, Lille, Lyon, Colmar, Pontoise,Luxeuil, have been bombarded by Germanaeroplanes.There were some killed and injured at Nancy.Two soldiers were killed at Lyon.Two houses destroyed in the neighbourhood ofLille and three bombs were, aimed at the Prefectureat Colmar.The casualties at Nancy were sixteen killed and thirty wounded probably mainly if not entirelycivilian.&quot;(3) A telephone message had been received from our embassy in Paris to the effect that the Germans had bombedseveral aerodromes in France, including those at Calaisand Dunkirk, but in the last two cases had apparentlycarefully avoided the towns. The French had, however,announced that several open towns, including Lille,Lyon, Colmar, Nancy and Abbeville had been bombed.(4) Later, a report was received that an aircraft factory atClermont-Ferrand had been bombed.(5) At 9 - 40 a.m. the Belgian Embassy had informed the ForeignOffice that the Belgian Government had declaredBrussels an open town and had stated that no troops were stationed there and that no troops would pass through. The German Government had been informed of this declaration through the United States embassy in Berlin, which had taken charge of Belgian interests.This information had also been passed on to Mr. sumner welles.
(6) A house near the United States Embassy in Brussels hadbeen destroyed by bombs.(7) M. Spaak had stated at 11-15, to the Counsellor at the embassy, that the bombing had been mainly, if not entirely, against four aerodromes. Very little injuryhad been done, and it was doubtful if the bombing of civilian targets had been deliberate.(8) The Bank of England had telephoned to Brussels in thecourse of the morning, but bombing had been going proportionate the time and it had been impossible to get any reliableidea of the situation.(9) Our Minister at The Hague had telephoned at 11-40 that morning to say that at least one and probably two orthree bombs had just dropped within 500-600 yards ofour Legation. The only possible excuse might be thatthe Dutch War Office and Ministry of Foreign affairs were in that neighbourhood.Allied policy: The view was generally expressed that, in the light of thisemployment of information, it certainly seemed that we should be justified inthe heavy starting bombing operations on military targets in the Ruhr thatbomber force. evening. It was agreed, however, that it would be as well to defertaking a final decision until, say, 5 p.m. that evening, in the lightof further information which might be received in the course of theday.Netherlands andBelgium.Invasion byGermany.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (40) 117thConclusions.)3.   The War Cabinet were given the following information asto the morning&apos;s events : (i) The United States Ambassador in Brussels had said that belgium had had no warning or notice from the GermanGovernment until 8-40 a.m. when the german ambassador called on the Foreign Minister with amemorandum. The Foreign Minister refused to acceptthe Memorandum and gave the Ambassador a piece ofhis mind.(ii) The United States Ambassador in London had said thatthe Prime Minister of Luxembourg had stated that therewas a concentration of German planes on theLuxembourg frontiers.(iii) The Germans had landed parachute troops at numerousplaces throughout Holland. According to present information these had all been dealt with, or were being dealt with, except those who had landed at the Rotterdamaerodrome, which was, still apparently under Germancontrol.(iv) The Chief of the Air Staff said that he had already sent a force of fighters from this country to attack theGerman machines at Rotterdam aerodrome. He had thought it better not to send bombers since a bombing attack might have caused Dutch civilian casualties.(v) The United States Minister at The Hague had reportedthat parties of German troops were landing from sea-planes along the coast; and that German aircraft werelaying magnetic mines.(vi) A telephone message had been received at 11-35 a.m. from our Embassy at Paris to say that our Ambassador had just learnt that the French had no informationsuggesting that there were large scale movements ofGerman troops against either Belgium, the Netherlands. or Luxembourg.   The enemy appeared to be workingmainly with small detachments, parachutists, &amp;c.
Arrival of dutch ministers in this country.Appeal to the pope and theKing of Italy.Sir Roger Keves.(vii) The  Chief of  the Imperial General Staff said that according to the reports received it looked as if theGermans were advancing through Luxembourg and theArdennes to the line of the Meuse, and at the same timeadvancing through Belgium to the line of the AlbertCanal. Zero hour for the advance of our forces into belgium was one o&apos;clock that afternoon. It was probablethat our advance forces were already on the move, aszero hour always referred to the movement of the main body.(viii) The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that he had just been informed that the Royal Marine operation would be put into action at 9 p.m. that night.(ix) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thatthe Dutch Foreign and Colonial Ministers were arrivingthat day in this country by air.(x) A telegram had been received from our Ambassador inParis to the effect that the French Ambassador at the vatican had been instructed to urge the Pope to make some announcement in regard to the German invasion ofBelgium, Luxembourg and Holland, and the french ambassador at Brussels had been instructed to urge theKing of the Belgians to make an appeal to the king of Italy.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The First Lord, of the Admiralty suggested that Admiral ofthe Fleet Sir Roger Keyes should be sent to Brussels with instructions to offer his counsel and support to the King of the belgians, with whom he was on terms of close personal friendship.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.TheNetherlands andBelgium.Denial of dutch and Belgianresources toGermany.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 117thConclusions.)Co-operation ofour forces withDutch andBelgianGovernments.Operation XD.4. The Minister without Portfolio informed the War Cabinetthat His Majesty&apos;s Representatives had already impressed on theDutch and Belgian Governments the need for dealing effectively with the following : Gold and securities.Dock and harbour facilities.Raw materials, including oil.Rolling stock.Mechanical transport.Shipping, barges, &amp;c.Aircraft and aerodrome facilities.Machine tools.Power stations.We had not yet heard from His Majesty&apos;s Representativeswhether the Dutch and Belgian Governments would welcome ourco-operation in this work, but the Admiralty had heard from theNaval Attache at The Hague that our forces would be received inDutch ports.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that steps were beingtaken for the removal of the gold still left in Holland.The Minister without Portfolio reported that destroyers with military parties were ready to sail to Ymuiden, Hook of Holland,Flushing and Antwerp to deal with dock and harbour facilities,oil and coast defences (Operation XD). Detailed arrangements hadbeen made for the destruction of oil stocks by this party, but, inaddition, there was a scheme held in reserve for oil destruction tobe carried out by the R.A.F.   The destroyers would sail during the
OperationLyster.Aircraft andaerodromefacilities.Shipping.Magnetic mines.Frenchresponsibilities.Wireless andbroadcastingstations.course of the day. If the French Army arrived successfully inFlushing and Antwerp, they would take over the responsibility fordemolitions at those places.Block ships would be in readiness from the following day forblocking Zeebrugge and Ostende if necessary (Operation Lyster).The Admiralty would sail the ships when they thought the rightmoment had come.An Air Mission had already been sent into Belgium inaccordance with pre-arranged plans. Among other things, it would try to secure the withdrawal of aircraft and the destruction ofaerodrome facilities. The withdrawal of civil aircraft from holland and Belgium to this country was already taking place.Steps had been taken by the Admiralty to withdraw all Britishand Norwegian shipping from Dutch and Belgian ports. In theabsence of prearranged plans, it had not yet been possible to take any action regarding Dutch and Belgian shipping. A Dutchshipping authority had, however, arrived in London and was intouch with the Ministry of Shipping. The withdrawal of dutch and Belgian shipping would depend upon the action taken by theDutch and Belgian Governments and shipping interests.D.W.I. aircraft had been despatched to explode the mines whichhad been dropped in the Scheldt at Rotterdam. Shipping had been ordered to raise steam and move out.Dock facilities and oil supplies at Bruges and Ghent and theevacuation of rolling-stock and mechanical transport and of skilledpersonnel were being handled by the French, as far as circumstances would permit, and in accordance with the progress of the landarmies.In reply to a question, the Minister without Portfolio said thatno arrangements had been made, so far as he knew, for the destruc-tion of wireless and broadcasting stations in Holland and Belgium.He undertook to make arrangements for this to be dealt with inconsultation with the Admiralty.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Civil defence measures.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 117thConclusions.)B.B.C.-announcementsregarding A.R.P.measures.Refugees from holland andBelgium.5. The Minister of Home Security said that a meeting of allthe Ministers concerned with civil defence measures had been heldat 10-30 a.m. This meeting had made a number of recommenda-tions, for which he asked the approval of the War Cabinet.(1) B.B.C. Announcements regarding A.R.P. Measures.A preliminary announcement had already been issued statingthat gas masks should be carried by the civil population, who shouldmake themselves acquainted with the nearest shelters. Householdersshould overhaul their A.R.P. arrangements. A further set ofannouncements had been prepared dealing with such matters asair raid warnings, care of gas masks, carrying of identity labels,lighting restrictions and warnings about the unnecessary use of telephone and telegraph communications. It was recommendedthat these announcements should be issued at intervals during thecourse of the day. An additional set of announcements had beenprepared dealing with such matters as the treatment of casualties in air raids, but it was recommended that these should not beissued for the present.(2) Refugees from Holland and Belgium.A scheme had been worked out in full detail to deal withrefugees from Holland and Belgium, some 300,000 of whom were expected. Preliminary confidential warnings had been issued to police, local authorities, &amp;c, to be prepared to put the scheme into effect. There was no intention of inviting refugees to cometo this country, and for this reason the warnings had been issued
Asylum for theex-Kaiser.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 81stConclusions,Minute 7.)Evacuationscheme.Evacuation fromspecial areas.confidentially. The Ministry of Information were being asked tokeep all references to this evacuation scheme out of the Press. Wemust expect, however, that ships coming from the Low countries would be filled wdth refugees. The refugee scheme included arrange-ments for sorting out any skilled workmen for use in our own industries as early as possible.The Fir at Lord of the Admiralty suggested that, if the Kaisersought asylum in this country, it should be afforded to him. Thiswas agi^eed to.(3) Evacuation.The timing of a general evacuation scheme would have to bevery carefully managed. If it was put into force too soon, people would not be ready and the transport facilities would be wasted.It was considered that the time had not yet come to put this scheme into effect.A new aspect of the question had been raised recently by a recommendation from the Commander-in-Chief at the No re, that allchildren and invalids should be moved out from the Medway towns,,and that an area within one mile of the dockyards should be cleared.The whole question of evacuation from East coast towns and portswould have to be examined by the Service Staffs and the Ministryof Home Security. Evacuation from these areas would cause seriouscomplications, if it took place at the same time as the mainevacuation scheme.The &apos;&apos; crash &apos;&apos; evacuation scheme for dealing with refugees whomoved out of their own volition, unorganised, was ready. Arrange-ments had been made to guide them to shelter, and food dumps wereprepared.(4) Cancellation of Whit sun Holiday.It was recommended that the Whitsun holiday should be calledoff and that the population should be urged to bend all their energiesto increasing war production. The President of the Board ofTrade, the Minister of Supply and the Minister of Labour were preparing, in consultation, the necessary announcements to theworkers. The Ministry of Information would, of course, be associated in these measures. It was proposed that the Ministry ofTransport should make a public announcement to the railway andtransport companies that holiday traffic facilities should be cancelled, though they were being told privately to ensure that somefacilities were available in case these should prove necessary. ThePost Offices would remain open on Whit Monday. The treasury were considering whether the statutory Bank Holiday on Mondayshould be kept or not.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved the proposals of the Minister of Home Securityas set out in (1), (2), (3) and (4) above.(ii) Agreed that the question of evacuation from East coast towns and ports, and in particular the Medway Towns,in relation to the evacuation scheme generally, shouldbe considered by the Chiefs of Staff and the Ministryof Home Security.
The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 116thConclusions,Minute 3.)Mine-laying operations.6. The Secretary of State for Air said that 23 Hampdens had successfully carried out mine-laying on the previous night asfollows : in the Elbe Estuary,off Kiel,at Lubeck.113432at Helsingor.at Warnemunde.One of our machines had failed to return.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.France.Internal politicalsituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 102ndConclusions,Minute 1.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a message had been received from the Embassy at Paris to say thatthere was at present no prospect of M. Reynaud&apos;s resignation.Consultations were in progress and it was possible that the cabinet might be enlarged to form a national union (Blum, Marin, Petain),but the position at the moment was vague.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.probable intentions.(previous references:W.M. (40) 113thConclusions,Minute 7,and 116thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theAmerican Ambasador had said that he had spoken that morningon the telephone to his colleague in Rome who had just seenCount Ciano. The latter had told Mr. Phillips that the ItalianGovernment did not propose to do anything, and when Mr. Phillipshad asked him whether he should give instructions to americans to leave Italy, he had advised against it.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,May 10, 1940.
