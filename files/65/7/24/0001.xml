181W.M. 129 (40).The Military,Air and naval situation.Progress of operations onthe western front.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 127thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave the WarCabinet an account of the general situation on the Western Front.In the north the Belgians were retiring to the river line fromGhent to the Scheldt. The B.E.F. were on their right betweenGhent and Tournai. To the right of the B.E.F. the French were holding a line through St. Amand, Valenciennes, Maubeuge, LaFere, Marie, Moncornnet, Bethel.General Headquarters of the B.E.F. had evacuated Arras andthe Lines of Communication had been moved back to Abbeville-Arras.The latest indications were that the Germans were continuing their thrust north-west from Landrecies and Le Cateau, andadvanced elements were said to have reached Albert. At Peronnean enemy reconnaissance group of armoured fighting vehicles hadforced back light British detachments on the previous afternoon,but no enemy movement was reported between Peronne and Arrasother than a few enemy armoured fighting vehicles. The immediatedanger was the risk that the Germans would succeed in establishingthemselves across the British lines of communication betweenAmiens and Abbeville. If this happened the B.E.F. could only besupplied through Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk, all of which hadbeen attacked from the air on the previous night. It was of theutmost importance to prevent the B.E.F. and the Belgian Army onits left being cut off from the main French armies.The Belgians showed a certain reluctance to withdraw, as theywere not being attacked and were naturally loath to give up more oftheir territory.In accordance with the instructions of the Prime Minister,General Dill had now gone to France to spend the next four or five days with General Georges. An Officer would be returningthat evening with a report from General Dill as to the position.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had alsotelephoned to Lord Gort and had asked him to consider whether he could concentrate some part of the British Expeditionary Forcein the Arras area.Air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 127thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Prime Minister said that he felt sure the War cabinet would approve the action taken by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff. While the British Army was under the orders of general george, it was right that the Chief of the Imperial General staff and Lord Gort should concert as to the plans which should be takenin various eventualities to safeguard the position of the british expeditionary Force, and that these plans should be communicatedto General Georges, who would take them into account in giving his orders for the conduct of the battle.The Chief of the Air Staff gave the following account of air operations in the previous 24 hours.Bomber Command.Thirty-nine Blenheims had been sent to operate in France fromthis country. Of these only 11 had been able to carry out their tasks,attacking successfully troops and communications in the areaLandrecies-Avesnes. The others, on account of the confusioncaused by breakdowns in communications, and for other reasons,had been unable to operate, and had returned to England. ThreeBlenheims had been lost.During the night heavy bombers had been despatched asfollows : Area Givet-DinantArea Gembleux-Namur1112[21307a]
Recrudescenceof U-boatactivity.Antwerpdemolitions.Blocksbips forZeebrugge andOstend.(previous reference:W.M.

Theywere going to co-operate that day with a French counter-attack which it was believed was developing from the South.Air Component of the B.E.F.Full reports had not been received, as their squadrons were probably on the move. There had been considerable fighter activity,however, and it was known that the enemy losses had been heavy,and our own few.Coastal Command.There seemed to be an increase in enemy submarine activity,and several had been sighted at various places round the coast.The Chief of Naval Staff said that the report of demolitionsat Antwerp showed that all dry docks and heavy cranes and 150,000tons of petrol and oil had been destroyed; also that one lock hadbeen blocked.Blockships for Zeebrugge and Ostend would be ready to sailfor Belgium at 1330 hours that day. The Chief of Naval Staffsuggested that the ships should sail, as arranged, as there would beno difficulty in recalling them during the afternoon, if necessary.Later in the meeting it was decided that, in view of the militarysituation, the sailing of the blockships should be postponed untilthe following day.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of these statements.(ii) Decided that the sailing of the blockships for Zeebruggeand Ostend should be postponed until the ensuing day.Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 127thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that heavy German air attacks continued in the Narvik area. The two aircraft carrierswere waiting 100 miles off the Lofoten Islands to fly off theirfighter aircraft as soon as the landing grounds were ready. Ithad been hoped that the landing grounds would be ready that day the 19th May.The War Cabinet took note of the above information.
Norway. 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theProposal that attention of the War Cabinet to an unnumbered telegram, datedhostilities the 17th May, 1940, from Mr. Lascelles (the British representative should cease with the Norwegian Government in Norway) setting out a rathernorth of a obscure proposal,  apparently of  German origin,  under whichgiven line. fighting was to cease north of a line to be drawn at some unspecifieddistance north of Trondhjem. A similar proposal had also been mentioned in earlier telegrams from the British Minister at stockholm.The Foreign Secretary said that it was clear that any such proposal would be quite unacceptable, and it was only interestingas indicating the strain which the continuance of operations in norway was imposing on the German resources. He thought,however, that it would be as well that we should inform both theSwedish and Norwegian Governments that the proposal seemed tous entirely impracticable.The War Cabinet agreed that the Swedish and Norwegian Governments should be informed accordingly.India.Replacement ofRegularbattalions byTerritorialbattalions fromthe UnitedKingdom.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 108thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for India said that he had givenconsideration to the proposal that eight Regular British battalionsshould return from India to the United Kingdom, being replaced by Territorial battalions.The statement made by the Secretaiy of State covered thefollowing points : (1) There were now 42,000 British troops in India as comparedwith 77,000 in 1914. Of the 34 Regular infantry battalions included in the present garrison, 13 wereallocated to the defence of the North-West Frontier and21 to internal security duties.(2) The internal security battalions had, since the beginningof the war, been drained of their best Warrant Officers,Non-commissioned Officers and men.(3) Nevertheless, he was so impressed with the need for increasing the strength of our armed forces in the United-Kingdom that he was prepared to ask the Viceroy to consent to the return home of the eight Regularbattalions. This request would place the Viceroy in a difficult position which might be eased (a) If  the relief  troops  left  the  United  Kingdomsimultaneously with the departure of theRegulars from India.(b) If the relief consisted of more than 8 battalions ofterritorials. India would be an admirabletraining ground for these territorials, whiletroops trained in India would be available for service in the Middle East.(4) The political situation in India was not such as to make theexchange imprudent.In discussion, it was pointed out that there were serious difficulties in the way of arranging for the relief to leave thiscountry at the same time as the Regular battalions left India. Themilitary situation did not justify as many as 16 British battalionsbeing on the high seas at the same time. Further, it was unlikelythat shipping would be available at the same time to carry bothcontingents.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for India to ask the Viceroy,as a matter of urgency, to agree to the return of 8Regular battalions from India; these battalions would be
relieved by territorial battalions from the UnitedKingdom, which would probably sail back in the ships which brought the battalions home from India.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for India to draft his telegram to the Viceroy in consultation with theSecretary of State for War.Italy.possible intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 127thConclusions,Minute 9.)TheMediterranean.Diversion ofshipping.(Previous&apos; Reference:W.M. (40) 124thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The War Cabinet were given the following information which had a bearing on Italy&apos;s possible intentions : (i) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to theWar Cabinet the reply to the Prime Ministers message to Signor Mussolini.(ii) The Chief of the Naval Staff said that a seaplane-carrierwas due to sail from Tripoli on the 22nd May, bound forMassawa. This ship would not be clear of the suez canal until the 25th May, and would not reach Massawauntil the 27th May.(iii) The Chief of the Naval Staff also read out a signal fromthe Flag Officer in charge at Malta, giving a reportindicating probable operations by German and italian forces acting in co-operation in the Mediterranean.(iv) The Prime Minister read out a further signal from thesame source, forwarding a report that general Army andAir Force mobilisation was to take place in Italian EastAfrica immediately.Information was given as to Naval dispositions in theMediterranean.The Chief of the Naval Staff said that shipping in theMediterranean was being thinned out gradually. The transportswhich had brought the Australian and New Zealand troops to Suezwere, however, urgently required to transport French troops fromCasablanca, and he suggested that they should be told to sailindependently and chance getting through the Mediterranean.The War Cabinet-Took note of the above statements, and agreed to the course proposed as regards shipping in the Mediterranean.Italy.contraband control.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 127thConclusions,Minute 10.)&apos;A&quot;Signoi6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, sinceMussolini&apos;s reactions to the proposal seemed likely to be favourable, he had explored further the possibility of entering into negotiations with the Italian Government with the object ofminimising the annoyances caused to that Government by thepresent administration of our contraband control. On the previous day he had been in consultation with the Minister of economic warfare and his experts, and with the Master of the Rolls. TheMeeting had reached the conclusion that it was practicable, evenin present conditions, to open discussions with Italy on the lines suggested. Put briefly, the plan would be that as far as possibleall cargoes consigned to Italy from other countries should be coveredby navicerts. The attitude of some exporting countries, for example,the United States, might make it impossible to apply the planuniversally, but the control by means of navicerts would be made as complete as was reasonably possible. The line which we might take in public would be to say that we could not tell in advance how the new system would woi&apos;k in practice but that we intended, inorder to meet the Italian grievances, to try it on an experimentalbasis.
U.S.S.R. 7    xhe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, as aSuggested des- result of the decision of the War Cabinet at the Meeting referredpatch of a to in the margin, he had discussed further with the Minister forspecial envoy to Economic Warfare the proposal to send Sir Stafford Cripps onMoscow. an exploratory mission to Moscow.  They had reached the conclusion(Previous that it would be best to give him, as an experienced adviser and reference:        technical assistant, Mr. Ashton  Gwatkin of  the Ministry of w.M. (40) 127th Economic Warfare, who had just returned from the U.S.A.   he conclusions,      and the Minister for Economic Warfare proposed to see Sir StaffordMinute 13.)       Cripps on the following day and to explain to him the nature ofthe mission which he was being asked to undertake and the general political background, and the Minister for Economic Warfare wouldalso arrange to give him detailed information on the issues withwhich he was directly concerned.If Sir Stafford Cripps accepted the invitation he (the foreign secretary) would then put the suggestion to M.. Maisky, without saying anything as to the possibility of our sending an ambassador to Moscow. If the Soviet Government agreed, Sir Stafford Crippsand Mr. Ashton Gwatkin would set off on their mission as soon aspossible.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toproceed on these lines.The Inter-departmental Meeting had agreed on three principles which should govern the administration of our contraband controlvis-a-vis- Italy from the date of the new agreement, if one were concluded, until further notice : (i) The object of the proposed relaxation of our contraband control was to avoid or at least to postpone war with italy.(ii) Any relaxations of our contraband control were of atemporary nature (the use of the formula at &quot; A &quot; above would be one method of safeguarding our position inthis respect).   We should thus be able to reimpose our. control in its former severity if we thought fit.(iii) Our relaxations vis-a-vis Italy should not be such as to destroy our grounds of action vis-a-vis other neutral countries.It might be thought that these proposals went very far in thedirection of weakening our control. But it was no use making this new approach to the Italians unless we met them with an offer ongenerous lines. If we could hold the position vis-a-vis Italy duringthe next critical weeks, it would be well worth while.Sir Wilfrid Greene was leaving for Rome on the 21st May,accompanied b)r advisers from the Ministry of Economic Warfare.He asked that Sir Wilfrid should be given full powers to reach asettlement on the lines which he had indicated generally. SirWilfrid should be empowered to agree that no further Italian ships should be detained while the new system was under trial.The War Cabinet-Gave  a general approval  to  the Foreign  Secretary&apos;sproposals as summarised above.
United States of 8. The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs read to the WarAmerica. Cabinet a telegram No. 759, which he had just received, reportingPurchase of a conversation between Lord Lothian and President Roosevelt on aircraft. the previous evening.   President Roosevelt had, of course, shown(Previous himself very friendly and had emphasised the efforts which he was reference: making to keep Italy from entering the war. He had, however,W.M. (40) 126th said nothing which showed that he recognised our pressing need for conclusions, immediate aircraft supplies; nor had he mentioned the suggestionMinute 3.)        that the United States Government should let us have aircraft atonce from their own supplies, to be replaced later from ordersalready placed in the United States.The Prime Minister said that in these circumstances he proposed to send a telegram to President Roosevelt at once making clear our immediate needs.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Air to furnish thePrime Minister before 5 p.m. that day with information for inclusion in such a telegram.Gibraltar. 9.   The Secretary of State for  War recalled that on theEvacuation of 16th May the War Cabinet had agreed that the scheme for civilians. evacuating civilians from Gibraltar should be carried out.   The(Previous scheme covered both British Service families and Gibraltarians.References: A telegram had now been received from the Governor of w.M. (40) 108th Gibraltar stating that he was unwilling to carry out the scheme.Conclusions, His main reason was that the evacuation of civilians from GibraltarMinute 12, would create a most-unfavourable impression on Spanish opinion,and 124th and that it should not, therefore, be carried out unless we were conclusions,      certain that Spain would be hostile.Minute 10.) The matter had been further discussed inter-Departmentally.It would be possible to carry out the scheme after war had brokenout with Italy, but this would put a considerable strain on theNavy. The Foreign Office had taken the view that the effect of evacuation on Spanish opinion ought not to be serious.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, unless there was a revolution, he saw no reason to think that Spain would come into the war. He doubted whether the evacuation of certaincivilians from Gibraltar would alter Spanish policy.In further discussion, the view was expressed that theevacuation of civilians from Gibraltar could properly be represented as a precautionary measure, which was being taken in view of thedisturbed situation in the Mediterranean generally, and not as ameasure made necessary by anxiety as to Spain&apos;s intentions.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Governor of Gibraltar should be instructedto put into effect the scheme for the evacuation of civilians.Care should be taken to explain that this was a precautionary measure taken in view of the disturbedsituation in the Mediterranean generally, and that it wasnot due to anxiety as to Spain&apos;s intentions.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 19, 1940.
