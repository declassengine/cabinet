Unemployment 1.   The   War   Cabinet  had  before   them  a   MemorandumInsurance submitted by the Minister of Labour and National Service to theScheme. Home Policy Committee proposing certain modifications in theUnemployment Insurance Scheme (H.P.C. (40) 164). The proposals in this Paper had been considered and approved by the Home PolicyCommittee at their meeting on the 21st June (H.P.C. (40)21st Meeting, Conclusion 1) subject to one modification.The Minister of Labour and National Service explained thathis first proposal was to raise the rates of benefit in both thegeneral and the agricultural schemes and at the same time the contribution rates. The change would be in the main self-supporting, although there would be an inevitable increase in theTreasury contribution. An increase in the rates of benefit was fully justified by the increased cost of living. Moreover, under war conditions there would inevitably be serious pockets of unemploy-ment, e.g., men previously employed in luxury trades who could notat once be found employment on war work. The next month would show some increase in the total number of unemployed in the country,though this might be cancelled out by the large intake into the armed Forces.His second proposal was to bring into Unemployment Insurancenon-manual workers earning between  250 and  420 per annum.The latter figure had been agreed by the Home Policy Committeein place of the  500 originally proposed by him. He thought thatthese people had had a strong case for inclusion in the scheme,even before the war, and that it was dangerous politically to run the risk of their having grounds for discontent during the difficult period of adjustment that would certainly follow after the war.They were not the kind of people to take kindly to the official.scheme for the Prevention and Relief of Distress.The reduction in the upper limit from  500 to  420 per annumhad been made, not because of the savings which would result(some  60,000 per annum only), but because of the repercussions on other social services which would have resulted from adopting the higher figure.The third proposal was to modify the continuity rule so thatbenefit could be paid if the worker were unemployed for two outof any six consecutive days, instead of three out of six as atpresent. He was satisfied that this change would cost the schemenothing and would result in more hours per week being worked,more particularly as he proposed to accompany it with thetightening up of the Regulations in two respects as set out in his memorandum. At present a man who had been out of work for two days was often tempted to stay away from work the third day because unemployment benefit for the three days would bemore profitable to him than one day&apos;s pay.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in view of the largesum of money involved he was glad that this - proposal had beenbrought before the War Cabinet. He did not raise any objectionto the proposals, except to that for bringing in to the scheme non-manual workers earning between  250 and  420 per annum. this he found difficult to justify as a war-time measure, since it wouldhave little effect in the immediate future and could only be justified as a permanent reform of our social services. It was hardly thetime to carry through such a reform, when it was only too probablethat after the war we should be hard put to it to maintain our social services on their present level. For the present he thought thatthe needs of the black-coated workers were fully met by the war-time scheme for the Prevention and Relief of Distress. Theproposed modification would also certainly lead to a demand for similar modifications in other social services, with a consequent increase in the burden on the Exchequer.The Lord Privy Seal agreed with the Minister of Labour thatit was important to make provision now for the serious position[21445] b 2
that would be likely to arise after the war. It might very wellbe that our services generally would have to be cut down; if so,they should all be cut down together, and that was no reason forexcluding the black-coated worker.The Minister without Portfolio pointed out that requirementsof war production would inevitably lead to the closing down of much black-coated employment. Quite apart from the possibilitiesof the post-war situation, it was important to give these workers the sense of security now. This would make it far easier to carryout any changes and transfers which war conditions might require.The Prime Minister said that he had thought it right thatthese proposals, though they had been fully considered by the home policy Committee, should be brought before the War Cabinet asa considerable sum of public money was involved and an importantextension of the social services. He himself considered that theMinister of Labour had fully made out the case for his proposals.There was general agreement with this view.The War Cabinet-Took note with approval of the decision of the home policy Committee (H.P.C. (40) 21st Meeting, Conclusion 1)in regard to the proposals contained in H.P.C. (40) 164for the modification of the Unemployment InsuranceScheme.France.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 179thConclusions,Minute 8.)France.Suggestedestablishmentof a FrenchGovernment in north Africa.Visit by theMinister ofInformation andLord Gort toRabat.2. Further discussion took place on the position in regard tothe French Fleet. A record of the discussion, and of the conclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.3. The- Secretary of State for War said that a message hadbeen received from the Military Mission in Syria, emphasising theneed for the establishment of a French Government in Algeria,and stating that General de Gaulle was not strong enough to carryFrench Colonial opinion with him. The Mission suggested that a broadcast by the Prime Minister would be valuable, but that thevoice of an independent French Government should first make itselfheard. According to reports received by the Director of military intelligence, M. Maurois had emphasised the importance of anylead that General Nogues could be persuaded to give; it was probable that General Mittelhauser would be very much influenced by such action. It had been suggested that a representative of theBritish Government should be sent out to see General Nogues atonce.A message had been received from General Dillon that french resistance in North Africa was likely to continue, but that theorganisation of native resistance would be better left in Frenchhands. British assistance should, if possible, take the form of thesupply of arms and munitions.The Secretary of State for War suggested that a telegram should be sent to General Dillon asking whether a visit to GeneralNogues by a representative of the British Government would help him to restore the situation.The Prime Minister read a telegram that had just beenreceived from Casablanca to the effect that General Nogues had been summoned to Bordeaux. It was not stated whether he wascomplying with these instructions.
Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 24, 1940.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a message from His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Rabat (No. 32), timed6-50 p.m., to the effect that the former Ministers of M. Reynaud&apos;cabinet, accompanied by their families, had arrived at Rabat andwere reported to be on their way to England. They were expectedto leave Rabat within 24 hours unless a decision had been reached in the meanwhile to continue resistance in Morocco.It should be possible to communicate with this party through his Majesty&apos;s Consul-General. If so, they might be invited to get into immediate touch with General Nogues.The Secretary of State for Air suggested that government representatives should be sent immediately by flying-boat to get intouch with M. Reynaud at Rabat.The Chief of the Air Staff said that British representativescould be sent non-stop by flying-boat. The journey would take about ten hours.The Minister of Information supported the proposal to send the Government representatives to North Africa, and offered to gohimself.The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs said that a telegram had been received from Algiers saying that no official announcementhad yet been made by General Nogues, but the general opinionseemed to be that resistance would not continue. It was thereforemost important that some representative of the British Govern-ment should arrive in French North Africa as soon as possible.The Prime Minister said that he would gladly accept the offer made by the Minister of Information to fly out at once to north africa. It was most important that a British Minister should seeM. Reynaud, and if possible General Nogues, at the earliestpossible moment.After some discussion, it was decided that it would bedesirable that the Minister of Information should be accompanied,by a British Military Representative and that Lord Gort should beasked to join the party.The War Cabinet-(i) Agreed that the Minister of Information and General LordGort should proceed by flying-boat to Rabat as early aspossible on the 25th June in order to try and get intouch with the former Ministers of the ReynaudCabinet, who were reported by His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General to have arrived there. They should urge themto set up a French Government in North Africa or,alternatively, in Syria, or, if that were not possible, tocome to this country and form a Government here. TheMinister of Information was authorised to remind theMinisters in question that the stocks of French goldwhich were held in this country, or on which it was hoped to lay hands, would be at their disposal.(ii) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform His Majesty&apos;sConsul-General, Rabat, at once of the above deputation and to instruct him to pass on this information with aheartening message to the former Ministers of theReynaud Cabinet, and suggest to them that they shouldawait the arrival of the Minister of Information andLord Gort.
