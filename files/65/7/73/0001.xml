The AirSituation1.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that during the previous day only one enemy formation had approached our coasts.   This(Previous had consisted of 4 new type Heinkel 113&apos;s, which had been engagedReference:        by 6 Hurricanes.   The combat had resulted in some damage to twoW.M. (40) 177th of our Fighters caused by cannon guns carried in the Heinkels.Conclusions,      One of the Heinkels was believed to have been shot down.Minute 1.)fighter command.The Dortmund-Ems aqueduct.bomber command.coastal command.Middle east command.Reportedbombing of berlin.There had been no activity the previous night over the british isles.A reconnaissance over the Dortmund-Ems aqueduct showed that the aqueduct was still intact. The mine used in these opera-tions had been extemporised, as the ordinary 500-lb. bomb had notbeen thought heavy enough to damage the aqueduct, while theaircraft used could not carry a 2,000-lb. bomb. The 1,000-lb. bombwhich would be very suitable for the task was only just coming offproduction. Experiments with the type of mine used had resultedin a rather feeble explosion.The Secretary of State for Air said that he had discussed this operation with the officers who had carried out the attack. Theyhad flown low over the canal in succession and had seen bombsactually falling in the water. There was no doubt at all that the bombs had fallen on the target, but it seemed clear that no realdamage had been done to the aqueduct.The Prime Minister asked for a further report as to the attackon this aqueduct.The Chief of the Air Staff said that seven Blenheims had attempted to attack the marshalling yard at Hamm, but, owing to lack of cloud cover, only one aircraft had succeeded in droppingbombs on the target. Lack of cloud cover had also accounted forthe failure of 24 other Blenheims to attack their railway objectives;they had attacked an aerodrome in Holland instead, with some success.   Three of these aircraft were missing.During the previous night 73 aircraft had operated over germany. Their objectives had been three aluminium plants in the ruhr, two airframe assembly factories, the Hamm marshalling yard, trains and barges; and mines were to have been dropped inthe Jade-Weser Estuary. Reports of these operations were notyet available, but it was known that only one casualty had occurred.A very successful reconnaissance of Trondhjem had revealedone Hipper Class Cruiser and three Destroyers in the harbour. Ithad not been possible to carry out a reconnaissance of Stavanger.Small attacks had been carried out on Italian objectives in east Africa and Libya with some success. A heavy attack by theItalians on DJibuti had caused only slight damage. The attacks on Malta the previous day had achieved no important results andone Italian fighter had been shot down by a Gladiator.The Lord President of the Council drew attention to theGerman reports that bombs had been dropped on the suburbs of berlin. If no such action had been taken by our aircraft, these reports should be denied.The Chief of the Air Staff confirmed that these attacks hadnot been carried out by the Royal Air Force.The Prime Minister said that the German reports should atonce be denied by the Air Ministry.[21440a]
The Military 2.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that reportsSituation. had been received from Gibraltar stating that the Governor was(Previous very concerned over the continued arrival of refugees from MarseillesReference: and elsewhere, and over the quantity of shipping in the bay. ItW.M. (40) 177th constituted a threat to the security of the fortress.Conclusions,Minute 2.)Evacuation of The Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister foreign troops of Home Security said that although the numbers of refugees from and refugees France that had so far reached this country were small, reports from France: had been received that 30,000-40,000 might soon be expected. this position at was an alarming prospect both from the point of view of homeGibraltar. security and of accommodation; we were approaching the limit of civilian accommodation available in this country. It would therefore be most necessary to prevent an uncontrolled influx of refugees, and he had arranged with the Admiralty for instructionsto be issued that ships should not be filled up indiscriminately withrefugees.The Chief of Naval Staff explained that the congestion ofshipping at Gibraltar was probably caused by the assembly of convoys, and that ships would be dispersed from the bay as quickly as was practicable. The instructions referred to by the Ministerof Home Security had already been sent to all the ships concerned.Reports had recently been received that a large force of polish troops had assembled at St. Jean de Luz and were awaitingembarkation.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it was not certain that all these Allied troops would arrive armed, and thatwe might shortly find ourselves receiving them in greater numbersthan we could usefully employ.The Prime Minister said that we might in addition expect toreceive the Czech Brigade. If these Allied troops arrived unarmedand were unsuitable for employment, arrangements could always bemade to send them on elsewhere. It was most important that ships and refugees should not be allowed to collect at Gibraltar. Refugeesshould not be admitted to the fortress and the Admiralty should arrange to clear the surplus shipping from the bay as quickly aspossible. Refugees seeking entry to this country should be carefullyscrutinised, but efforts should be made to ensure that admission wasnot refused to qualified technicians.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 177thConclusions,Minute 3.)Naval losses.Enemy attacks on shipping.3. The Chief of Naval Staff said that an explosion had occurred on board the destroyer Khartoum on the 23rd June, causedby a burst torpedo air vessel. She had been beached at Perim and reports had been received that salvage would be impossible. Therehad been few casualties and the ship would be dismantled in due course.Reports had been received that the patrol vessel Pathan hadbeen seriously damaged early on the 23rd June off Bombay by an explosion, probably caused by a mine. The Port of Bombay hadbeen closed pending investigation.The Polish submarine Wilk was now reported able to diveand was slowly returning to port.The British ship Albuera (3,477 tons) had been reporteddamaged in Dungeness Roads either by enemy mine or motor torpedo boat action. , .
Attacks onItaliansubmarines.reinforcements for Iceland.Canary Islands.An Italian submarine was reported to have been sunk by gun-fire from one of our destroyers to the south-west of Perim early onthe 23rd June. Pour out of the eight Italian submarines believed to be operating east of Suez had now been accounted for.The Chief of Naval Staff gave details of the reinforcements ontheir way to Iceland and said that the aircraft on arrival wouldbe able to carry out short-range reconnaissances of the island and immediate approaches in order to obtain early news of any landing.The Northern Patrol should give warning of the distant approach of any large landing force.Reports had been received of the arrival of considerablereinforcements in personnel and material on the Canary Islands.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Spain. 4.   In connection with Fleet dispositions, discussion took placeAttitude of       as to tne attitude of Spain.Spanish Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that no reportGovernment. ^ad yet Deen received from Sir Samuel Hoare of his interview with(Previous General Franco on the 22nd June.     The Spanish Minister for reference: Foreign Affairs had told Sir Samuel on the 21st June that theW.M. (40) 175th Spanish Government was convinced that the French Empire was conclusions, crumbling, and that in refraining from action against France theyMinute 7.)        were acting chivalrously (telegram No. 390 DIPP from Madrid).The Foreign Secretary said that, while he could not guarantee that Spain would not make a sudden attack upon us, he did not expect that Spain would enter the war in the immediate future,or at least without some warning.The Prime Minister thought that to keep valuable ships in gibraltar harbour within range of Spanish artillery presented too great a temptation to Spain.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.France.French shipping and shipping in french ports.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 177thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Chief of the Naval Staff said that it had been reportedthat German forces would shortly arrive opposite Le Verdon, atthe mouth of the Gironde. There were some 20 to 30 Allied and neutral merchant ships in this port, including 7 tankers. Prepara-tions had been made to send a party to cut out these ships. It wouldtake the party 24 hours to reach the Gironde, and they should leaveat once.   Detailed instructions could be sent to them en route.In discussion, the view was expressed that this plan should becarried out, but that it was somewhat premature to include french ships in the operation. It was pointed out that the terms of thearmistice between Germany and France were not yet in operation,and French territory had not, therefore, yet been handed over to-the enemy.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked whether, in addition toholding all French merchant shipping in British ports, instructions should now be given for all French ships found at sea to be broughtinto British ports under armed guard.The War Cabinet-(l) Agreed that an expedition should at once be despatched to cut out merchant vessels from Le Verdon, but that, unlessinstructions to the contrary were received, French ships,should not be taken out of the port:[21440a]b ,3
(2) Deferred until the Meeting to be held that afternoon thequestion whether instructions should be issued for all french ships found at sea to be brought into british ports under armed guard.France.The EmileBertin and theBeam.(previous reference:Conclusions,Minute 6.)6. The First Sea Lord said that H.M.S. Dunedin had arrivedat Martinique before Emile Bertin and Beam. He read out a draftof instructions for the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. Dunedin.In discussion, it was pointed out that, if, under the terms ofthe armistice, the gold in the Emile Bertin would come into the possession of Germany, we had a right to take possession of it.W.M. (40) 177th indeecl; a delay in putting the armistice into operation might havebeen arranged by Germany with the intention that as many of theFrench resources as possible should be brought into French territoryduring the &apos;&apos; twilight&apos;&apos; period.The Emile Bertin was faster than H.M.S. Dunedin, and every endeavour should be made to keep the two French ships safe atMartinique.The War Cabinet-Pending a decision on the general policy to be adopted towards the present French Government, approved thedraft instructions to the Commanding Officer of H.M.S.Dunedin, subject to it being made clear that we regardedourselves as legally entitled to ensure that the gold inEmile Bertin did not fall into the hands of the enemy.France.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 177thConclusions, .Minute 4.)France.General policy towards thepresent FrenchGovernment.7. The First Sea Lord gave the War Cabinet information asto the present position in regard to the French Fleet. particulars of this information are contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.8. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute, a preliminary discussion took place as to our policy towardsthe present French Government.The Prime Minister read a message from M. Reynaud whichhe had just received through the French Ambassador. M. Reynaudpleaded that there should be no recriminations against the presentFrench Government, and attempted to argue that, notwithstanding the terms of the armistice, the British Government would be safe-guarded against the enemy obtaining possession of the French Fleet.It was clear from this message that M. Reynaud could be no more relied on than any of the other members of the BordeauxGovernment. This Government had broken their solemn treaty obligations with us and were now completely under the thumb ofGermany. They would allow all their resources to fall into thehands of the enemy and be used against their previous Allies.There was grave danger that the rot would spread from the topthrough the Fleet, the Army and the Air Force, and all the french colonies. The Germans would put every form of pressure uponthe Government to act to our detriment. They would inevitably be drawn more and more into making common cause with Germany,and we must expect that soon we should be the object of the deepesthatred of France. So long as the position of the French warshipswas unsecured, they would be used as a blackmailing threat against
us. We must at all costs ensure that these ships either came under our control or were put out of the way for good.In the near future we should have to solve the problem of our future relations with the present French Government. If it was tobe located in an enclave surrounded on all sides by enemy-occupied territory, we could not maintain an Ambassador with it, since weshould have no means of communicating with him. In such circum-stances, it was difficult to see how we could accept a french ambassador in London. Our relations might well approach very closely to those of two nations at war with each other.The Lord Privy Seal emphasised that the first necessity was toget some sort of French Government going as quickly as possiblein whichever of the Colonies seemed most likely to continueresistance. General de Gaulle seemed the most promising head ofsuch a Government.The Minister of Information said that he had received fromCount Sforza a message from M. Herriot for transmission to thePrime Minister, in which M. Fferriot had pleaded that we shouldmake no recriminations against Marshal Petain&apos;s Government. he himself, and others who were favourable to our cause, intended toremain in France, since they felt that they would be doing moregood there than by leaving for one of the Colonies.(Previous The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the reference: French Ambassador had expressed to him on the previous day theW.M. (40) 177th grave concern which he and M. Leger felt over our action in conclusions, supporting General de Gaulle. He was most anxious to do every-Minute 8.) thing possible to keep French resistance alive, but insisted that wewere not going the right way about it. He had asked that weshould not allow General de Gaulle to make his broadcast on theprevious night. Later on, he had telephoned to say that he washorrified by the terms of General de Gaulle &apos;s broadcast and by theBritish declaration which had also been broadcast recognising theProvisional French National Committee. He had again developedhis argument that we were approaching the problem on the wrong-lines, and he had pleaded that publication in the Press of the british governments declaration should be stopped. Since the declarationhad already been broadcast, he (the Foreign Secretary) had not thought that suspension of its publication in the Press would belikely to matter much. Accordingly, he had reluctantly agreed todo his best to withhold publication of the declaration. He regretted the difficulties in which the Minister of Information had beenplaced vis-a-vis the Press as a result of this decision, but he had felt bound to make some concession to M. Corbin&apos;s insistence.M. Corbin had again been to see him earlier that morning, andhad repeated his arguments that a French National Committee inLondon, headed by an unknown personality like General de Gaulle,would do more harm than good. It would be a target for everysort of enemy propaganda and could only result in sowing-dissensions among the large number of Frenchmen who were anxiousto continue the struggle. The proper course was to work for the setting up of a Government in North Africa of well-known Frenchpolitical figures. He had pointed out to M. Corbin that there were no signs at present of such a Government materialising, and inthese circumstances there appeared to be no alternative but to backGeneral de Gaulle, who was at least a vigorous personality.The position of M. Corbin was certainly a very difficult one,though it was disturbing to find that he was in opposition toGeneral de Gaulle, who had mentioned him as the first of hisbackers. The problem of our relations with the Bordeaux Govern-ment was most difficult.While he agreed generally with the views expressed by thePrime Minister, he thought that it might be desirable that we
should go rather slow for the present in withdrawing recognitionfrom the Petain Government. To do so would give food for enemy propaganda that we were treating Prance as an enemy, and mightextinguish the will to resist, in co-operation with us, which existedamong large numbers of French people.The Prime Minister said that he would send a reply toM. Reynaud setting out the position as he saw it.  He would makeit clear that no trust could be put in the German word, and thatthere was no limit to the pressure which Germany would put onFrance.   It was not a question of recrimination, but of things which were to us matters of life and death.French military        The Prime Minister then read out a telegram which had beenunits in this      sent by General Weygand to General Lelong in London instructingcountry. him to arrange for the French troops now in this country to be sentto Casablanca.It was pointed out that these consisted of two battalions of theForeign Legion and two of Chasseurs Alpins. It might very wellturn out to be best that these men should be given the option of returning to France if they wished, or continuing the fight with us,but it was not possible or necessary to reach an immediate decision.It was easy to find excuses, e.g., lack of transport facilities.The Minister of Information said that General de Gaulle&apos;broadcast had now been given, and there was nothing more to bedone on the matter for the moment. It had been made clear thatwe recognised him, not as head of an independent Government, butas the head of a Committee which had been established to facilitate the co-operation of French elements who were determined to continueto fight the common enemy.The War Cabinet-Adjourned discussion of these matters until the meeting to be held at 6 p.m. that day.Egypt. 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that(Previous Sir Miles Lampson had reported that the Italian Minister and reference: his staff had now left Egypt, and that he (Sir Miles) was hoping toW.M. (40 )l75th see the King that morning.Conclusions, The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Minute 9.)U.S.S.R. 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that,(Previous in view of developments in the last day or two, it would be helpfulReference:        to him if the Prime Alinister could postpone his appointment toW.M. (40) 171st see      Maisky that afternoon.   The Prime Minister said that theConclusions       meeting of the War Cabinet would serve this purpose.Minute 6.)The Far East.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 173rdConclusions,Minute 7.)Attitude of theUnited States.11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 1089 from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington, which made it clear that,if we were faced with Japanese demands for the withdrawal of our troops from Shanghai, the United States would be ready to give us diplomatic, but not armed support.The Foreign Secretary proposed to look into the matter, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for War, and to submit proposals to the War Cabinet as soon as possible.
3^9C &apos;)    ft&apos;:Sweden.Seizure ofSwedishdestroyers.(previous reference:Minute 9/12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theSwedish Minister had called at the Foreign Office on the previous day and had argued very strongly that, as soon as the facts became known to the Germans, they would make further demands onSweden, to which Sweden would be bound to accede. In the resultGermany would gain advantages far more valuable to her thanWM (401 177th possession of the four destroyers would be to us. No hope had conclusions keen ne*d out to n^m t&apos;iat our decision would be changed, but hehad been asked not to report to his Government that our decisionstood, until his representations could, be considered by the WarCabinet.The Foreign Secretary also drew attention to telegrams nos. 766 and 769 DIPP from the British Minister at Stockholm,and said that, taken together, the further pieces of informationnow brought to his notice reinforced the doubts which he had previously felt as to the wisdom of our decision.The Chief of Naval Staff said that it was not correct, asrepresented in paragraph 3 of telegram No. 769 DIPP, that theBritish Commanding Officer had informed the Swedish naval officer that the Swedish Government had been informed of theproposed seizure. The Swedish Commanding Officer had demandeda written communication which had contained the statement thatthe Swedish Government woidd be informed.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had heard through theMinister of Labour that the Swedish Trade Union leaders were very much upset by our action, which they were afraid would strengthen the influence of the pro-German section in Sweden.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had not yetbeen able to consider the telegrams received that morning from theBritish Minister at Stockholm.The War Cabinet-Deferred consideration of this matter until the further meeting to be held that same afternoon.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 24, 1940.
