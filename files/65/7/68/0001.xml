The Chief of the Air Staff said that during the previous night about 120 to 150 enemy aircraft had carried out raids overthe Nor th-E astern, Eastern, and Southern Counties and as far Westas Cardiff.   Industrial targets had been the chief objectives.The most important places raided had been : Billingham experimental laboratory and red oxide plantof Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., damaged by fire.West Hartlepool gas and water mains damaged.Cardiff one merchant ship sunk.Stockton steel works damaged.Marchwood (Southampton) 4 magazines at the armamentdepot destroyed by fire.Three, and possibly four, enemy aircraft had been shot downby our fighters and possibly one by A. A. gun-fire. We had sustainedno fighter losses.The Chief of Naval Staff said that the destruction ofammunition at Marchwood had been appreciable. The admiralty were examining the possibility of increased dispersal.The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security said that civilian casualties had been very slight.Public morale was high.In reply to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff expressedthe opinion that our bomb raids were hitting Germany considerablyharder than the German raids were hitting us.The Bomber Command had had a very successful night. Itwas hoped that the Dortmund-Emms Canal had been so severely damaged that it would be unusable. Very successful attacks hadbeen made on aircraft on the ground at the Rouen-Boos and GlisseyAerodromes.Mine-laying operations had been carried out in Kiel Bay.One of our aircraft was missing.   Two others had been lost in crashes.The attacks which had been made on oil and railway targets in North-West Germany on the night 18th/19th June appeared tohave been most successful. Explosions had been started at many places.The heavy bombers in the south of France had returned to thiscountry some days ago. The maintenance personnel were beingdispersed amongst 13 ships which were about to sail from Marseillesfor Gibraltar. It was hoped to embark a number of A.A. gunswhich would be unloaded at Gibraltar.The Fleet Air Arm aircraft had been flown to Africa and would reinforce Malta.Twenty aircraft which were being flown out to the Middle Easthad landed at Malta and were now on their way to Egypt.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The Military 2.

Middle East. There was little news from the Middle East. Air reconnaissanceon the 17th June had disclosed enemy concentrations to the southward of Port Sudan.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.3. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War cabinet an account of the interviews he had had at Bordeaux on the previous day, subsequent to those reported by telegram. In the morning hehad seen M. Baudouin, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs,who had professed a fairly strong attitude. While waiting for lord Lloyd&apos;s arrival, he had had several calls from M. Monnet,urging the need for the French Government to leave Bordeaux in w.M. (40) 172nd good time-Conclusions On Lord Lloyd&apos;s arrival they had had some discussion, at which minute 4.) &apos; Sir Ronald Campbell had been present, in regard to a message tothe French Government which Lord Lloyd had brought.* It hadbeen .clear that, at the time when this message had been drafted, theWar Cabinet had not been aware that the French government intended to establish the Government outside France, and had not received the reassuring accounts of Admiral Darlan&apos;s attitude.They had felt that it might do more harm than good to repeat indetail the arguments in favour of establishing a French Governmentoutside France. At the same time, the British Governmentsassurances, particularly those as to the help which would be affordedas regards transport, would be of great value if put forward as aresponse to the French Governments statement of their intentions.He (the First Lord), with Lord Lloyd and the British Ambassador,had seen the French President at 7-30 p. m. M. Lebrun, who hadbeen very depressed and unable to cope with the situation, had madea long statement on the sufferings of France.At 10 p.m. they had seen Marshal Petain, M. Baudouin also being present. Lord Lloyd had repeated the British Governmentsmessage, which had been received in a somewhat better atmosphere.The principal theme of Marshal Petain&apos;s and M. Baudouin&apos;remarks had been an apologia for the French Governments actionin seeking for an armistice. They had argued that the conditionof the French people was such that, unless the FrenchGovernment had ascertained what terms Germany would offer, itwas impossible to ask for further sacrifices from the French people.Lord Lloyd, after offering transport to the French Government, had referred to the question of the French Fleet. He (the First Lord)had emphasised our heavy Destroyer losses, and had strongly pressedthat the French Government should turn their Destroyers over tous, and not to scuttle them. Marshal Petain, who had taken the viewthat Great Britain would have no difficulty in resisting invasion, had said that he understood our point of view, but had not thought it likely that the French Government would agree to turn theirDestroyers over to us. He had repeated that he would never allow them to fall into German hands.The withdrawal of the French Government from France was complicated by the attitude of President Lebrun, who had expressed his unwillingness to leave France. Subsequent to the interview,Lord Lloyd had spoken with M. Baudouin, who said that he intended to leave. Lord Lloyd had impressed upon him once more the dangers of delay.   The French plenipotentiaries had not yet* In this message the British Government undertook to put at the disposalof the French transport to evacuate as many men and as much material aspossible to North Africa, and also to transport such persons as the FrenchGovernment might designate, from Bordeaux. An undertaking was given thatthe British and French Fleets and Air Forces in the Mediterranean wouldcollaborate for the defence of North Africa. The previous offer to transformthe Alliance into complete union was confirmed.France.Visit of theFirst Lord ofthe admiralty to Bordeaux.(previous reference:

In the meanwhile, German forces were rapidlyapproaching.He could sum up the position of the French Government by saying that, though they seemed to suspect all our offers, they wouldnot face the fact that there was no real future for France unless they co-operated with us on the lines which we proposed.The Chief of Naval Staff said that a French vessel at Greenockhad intercepted on the previous day a wireless message in the french naval cypher, purporting to convey instructions from admiral darlan that all French ships should cease fighting and go to the nearest French port, and that they should pay no attention to any instructions received from England. This was probably a falsemessage put out by the Germans; and a signal had therefore beensent to H.M.S. Berkeley in order that enquiries could be made atBordeaux.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that this message hadbeen shown to him just before he left Bordeaux. He had been told that the Naval Attache had gone to the Ministry of Marine to make enquiries about it, but no further information had yet been received.At his meeting with Admiral Darlan, the latter had been quite firmin his purpose that the fleet should go on fighting and should bekept by any means possible from falling into the hands of the enemy.The Prime Minister suggested that, as there seemed a serious risk that the French might scuttle a considerable part of their fleetinstead of bringing it to British ports, they might be persuaded tomake greater efforts to get the vessels away if the U.S.A. wouldmake an offer to buy them. The money could be used for themaintenance of refugees or the rehabilitation of French territory.An immediate offer of this kind might do harm, as suggesting theassumption that the French were going to give up the struggle.But a telegram might be sent to our Ambassador at Washingtonputting the suggestion to him, asking him not to act on it immediately, but to be ready to put it to President Roosevelt if asuitable occasion should arise.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff referred to a numberof messages from the Governor and Commander-in-Chief at gibraltar urging the importance of sending British troops to stiffenFrench morale in North Africa. The Governor of Gibraltar had pointed out that, judging by the cold reception which the last party of British evacuees from Gibraltar had received at Casablanca, itwas evident that anti-British propaganda was having some success.The Prime Minister thought that it would be better to leave thequestion of sending troops to North Africa until we knew whatthe French Government were going to do.The War Cabinet were informed that, in spite of our repre-sentations to the French Government, the German air pilots whohad been taken prisoner by the French had not yet arrived in thiscountry.The War Cabinet (1) Took note of the above statements.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to prepare a draft telegram to President Roosevelt on the lines of &quot; X &quot; above.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make representations tothe French Government as a matter of urgency as to thetransfer to this country of German air pilots taken prisoner in France.
4. The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs again raised thequestion of the orders to be given to French shipping now detained in British ports.   In discussion the following points were made : (1) A recommendation had been received from an Inter-departmental Conference that the ban on Frenchshipping proceeding to French Colonial ports outsidethe Mediterranean should be removed.(2) The Foreign Office and the Trade Division of the admiralty had recommended that French shipping now in british ports should be permitted to proceed to neutral portsnot in the Mediterranean.(3) It appeared that there was some chance that the port ofBrest might not yet have fallen into the hands of theenemy. A considerable amount of British army trans-port had been left behind there and there might stillbe time to recover this.The War Cabinet-(i) Deferred a decision on the shipping questions which hadbeen raised. The Foreign Secretary was invited to bring these up again in one or two days&apos; time.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for War to consider as amatter of urgency whether it was still possible to recoverany of the Army transport left behind at Brest.The naval situation.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M.

The Chief of Naval Staff reported that the French Battle-ship Jean Bart was on passage to Casablanoa. The battleship Paris,the destroyer Ouragan, the large submarine Surcouf and a numberof small vessels had arrived at Plymouth. The battleship Courbet,after patrolling for some time off the Isle of Wight, was now reported to have come in to Portsmouth. A number of smaller72nd vesseiS had arrived at Portsmouth and also at Falmouth. Therewere a large number of merchant vessels at the latter port, whichwere being dispersed as soon as possible to other ports.The Chief of Naval Staff also described the measures that were adopted to provide, if possible, for the evacuation of the polish troops who were said to be approaching St. Malo.The Prime Minister urged that the Admiralty should make ittheir aim to evacuate as many as possible, not only of these polish troops, but of the far larger bodies who were trying to make their way to other points on the French coast. This should be regardedas an objective of the utmost importance.The S.S. Tudor (6,607 tons) had been torpedoed and sunk108 miles North-West of Finisterre. She bad been in the sameconvoy as the Baron London (3,164 tons), the unknown ship the lossof which had been reported on the previous day.

ProposedSeizure ofSwedishDestroyers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 172ndConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that, after further consultation between the Admiralty and the Foreign office on the previous evening, it had been decided to proceed with theproposed seizure of the Swedish destroyers acquired from Italy.It had been suggested that this might lead the Germans to seizeSwedish destroyers in the Baltic, but it had been agreed that thiswas not an adequate reason for abandoning our intention.The Chief of Naval Staff said that the destroyers had arrivedat the Faroe Islands on the previous day and that they had beenjoined their by an oiler and a depot ship. Instructions had nowbeen issued for the destroyers to be seized and their crews to beremoved to the depot ship if it could accommodate them. If not,they were to be brought back to the Clyde. In that case the question would arise of giving them money with which to provide for their immediate needs.The War Cabinet-Reaffirmed their approval of the issue of instructions forthe seizure of these Swedish destroyers.Japan. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred again(Previous to Tokyo telegram No. 1032, to the effect that the. British MilitaryReference: Attache had been sent for by a Japanese Military RepresentativeW.M. (40) 172nd and had been told that, unless we took immediate action to complyConclusions, with certain Japanese demands, the Japanese Military would declareMinute 8.) war.This matter was put in rather a different light in telegramNo. 1037 from Tokyo reporting a conversation between Sir robert craigie and the Japanese Foreign Minister after the signature ofthe Tientsin Agreement. The latter had said that the General Staffs message should not be taken too seriously. Any communica-tions which the Japanese Government had to make to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would come through himself, and not through anyother channel. While he intended to discuss with the Ambassadorthe points which the Japanese Military Representative had mentioned, the form and substance of his communication would be entirely different from the message from the General Staff.The Foreign Secretary said that it looked as if we should havetrouble with the Japanese later on, but not immediately. the telegrams had been repeated to Washington, and Lord Lothianwould ascertain what view the United States Government took ofthem.Reported move In this connection attention was drawn to press reports to theof U.S.A. Meet, effect that the United States Fleet was being brought back to the atlantic.   The opinions were expressed : (i) That the demarche made by the Japanese General Staffmight have been concerted Avith the Germans, in orderto prevent the United States Fleet being transferred tothe Atlantic.(ii) That the departure of the United States Fleet from Pacificwaters would be an unfavourable development from ourQ. point of view, in view of our doubtful relations with theJapanese.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he would ask Lord Lothian to represent to the United States Government the considerations mentioned at (ii) above.
9. The Minister of Health said that, in the course of the3^ hours&apos; conversation which he had held with Mr. de Valera onMonday, the 17th June, he had impressed on the latter that thewar against Germany was one in defence of the freedom of everydemocratic country, including that of Ireland, and that HisMajesty&apos;s Government thought that Eire was in imminent dangerof invasion by Germany.   Their reasons for this were (a) That there was evidence from the &quot; Held &quot; papers andother documents that there was a plan for the invasion of Ireland;(b) That the experience of other neutral countries showed thatGermany did not hesitate to use this weapon against herenemies; and(c) That Eire was next on the list of neutral countries throughwhose territory an attack could be launched against-Great Britain.His Majesty&apos;s Government were grateful to Mr. de Valera for having agreed to the staff conversations which had taken place; butthe measures agreed on were not nearly enough to ward off thelightning attack which Germany was likely to make. The enemy was now in possession of the West Coast of France, on which hecould base a seaborne attack. Troops landed by parachutes oraeroplanes could easily swoop upon Irish territory, which wassparsely populated and ideal for the purpose. Moreover, the largenumber of German citizens and members of the I.R.A. at largewould provide an effective Fifth Column.Irish troops were not sufficient to deal with ruthless attacks onthe German model, and, under the plan drawn up by the military advisers of the two countries, reliance would be placed on (a) thevigilance of British naval patrols (which could not use the ports ofDefence ofIreland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 168thConclusions,Minute 5.)Egypt. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the(Previous Egyptian Ambassador in London had been to see The King, andEeferenee: had presented a remonstrance from King Farouk against our allegedW.M. (40) 170th interference, in demanding the dismissal of Ali Maher. TheConclusions, Foreign Secretary also drew attention to Cairo telegrams Nos. 544Minute 7.)        DIPP and 548 DIPP, dated the 19th June.In discussion the following points were made : (1) The Foreign Secretary proposed that His Majesty shouldbe advised to send a firm but polite answer to Kingu-y.&apos;. Farouk, to the effect that Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s repre-sentations had been made on instructions from HisMajesty&apos;s advisers, who accepted full responsibility forthem.(2) It would be better that His Majesty&apos;s reply should notrefer to. the question whether Ali Maher should beallowed to occupy a position in King Farouk&apos;s Palace.(3) Action on this point had better be postponed until the newEgyptian Government was at work. We could then take steps in conjunction with that Government to keepAli Maher out of the Palace.(4) Neither Sir Miles Lampson nor General Wavell wished tosee the introduction of British martial law in Egypt(see Cairo telegram No. 544 DIPP).The War Cabinet (i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Invited the Foreign Secretary to tender advice to HisMajesty The King as proposed at &quot; X &quot; above.
Eire); and (b) the arrival of reinforcements from Northern Ireland,whose support might well be hindered or prevented by the sabotageof road and rail communications.In these circumstances, the view of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas that there was great danger of the Germans being able to carryout an effective landing by sea and air; that they could overwhelmthe resistance of the Eire troops; and might be in effectiveoccupation of the Twenty-six Counties within a few hours fromlanding. The wisest course for Eire would be the immediateabandonment of her neutrality and complete co-operation with us inresistance to Germany. This advice was given in the interest of eire herself, because, although an invasion of that country wouldembarrass us, it would be disastrous to her. To this suggestionMr. de Valera had returned an emphatic negative. He said that thewhole force of public opinion was against any abandonment of neutrality a moment before it was inevitable.He (Mr. MacDonald) had then asked whether it was possiblefor the Eire Government, with the support of the Opposition, to invite British -warships to use Irish ports, and to call in Britishtroops to guard strategic points in the defence of Eire&apos;s neutrality.Mr. de Valera had replied that there was no possibility of agreeing to this course, as the national unity which had been achieved betweenthe various parties in the country was based on the continued main-tenance of the policy of neutrality and on a firm resistance to theforces of either belligerent who became the aggressor. To permit the occupation of Ireland by the forces of one belligerent would provoke Hitler to carry out his aggressive schemes; it would destroy the national unity which had been achieved with such difficulty inIreland. It would make no difference to his answer whether theforces which came in were British, French, Polish or Dominiontroops. The position might have been different if there had beena United Ireland.Mr. MacDonald had then suggested that a step might be taken towards the project of a United Ireland by the establishment of ajoint council for the defence of the whole island. This, however,Mr. de Valera had rejected as a step involving a decisive breach of neutrality and as a blow to the national unity of Eire.The further suggestion was then put to Mr. de Valera that something could be done to improve the immediate prospect byarresting and imprisoning the I.R.A. leaders and by interningsuspect Germans and Italians. He had replied that, while all theleaders of the I.R.A. outside Dublin were under detention, theauthorities could not lay their hands on all the prominent I.R.A.members in Dublin itself. As regards Germans, the documentaryevidence available had not been sufficient to establish a conspiracyagainst the State, and there was no evidence of an unneutral actin favour of one of the belligerents.Mr. de Valera had made it plain that the Irish people intendedto put up a stout resistance to any invasion from whatever quarter;he had asked whether material assistance could not be afforded inthe shape, for example, of anti-tank weapons and aircraft. To thisMr. MacDonald had replied that we were not confident of the powerof the local forces in Eire to prevent any material we might supply from falling into the enemy&apos;s hands. We would, of course, sendhelp the moment we were asked to do so, but, in the circumstances which had been envisaged, this might have to be limited to theoperations of our Air Force.Summing up his impression of the interview, Mr. MacDonaldsaid that Mr. de Valera was undoubtedly impressed with the viewof His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the imminent danger of an invasion of Eire, which had previously been represented as some-what of a bogey. He would, however, emphasise his conviction thatMr. de Valera was genuine %in his determination to resist either
belligerent to the utmost limit of his power;-this resistance wouldbe directed against any attempt on our part to seize the Atlanticports by force.The Lord President of the Council said that the War cabinet were greatly indebted to the Minister of Health for the skill withwhich he had carried out his tasks; he had evidently succeeded ininstilling some sense of reality into Mr. de Valera. The latter,however, had repeated the old theme that he could do nothing to prejudice his country&apos;s neutrality, on which his much-vaunted&quot; national unity &quot; depended.The Lord President had seen a preliminary draft of an Aide-memoire from the Chiefs of Staff, which included the statement that there could be no security for Eire or- the United Kingdomunless proper arrangements were made which included the presenceof British or Dominion troops and Air forces in Eire, and HisMajesty&apos;s Ships in Irish ports. It was further pointed out thatthe main, and perhaps the sole, obstacle to such collaboration wasthe partition question.The Lord President said that, on the basis that help to Eireafter invasion had taken place might well come too late, we were compelled to consider the question of entering the Irish ports by force.At the same time, before this step was taken he would advocatefurther exploration of the ground, in view especially of the possibleunfavourable reaction which would be caused in the United Statesof America by any forcible measures against Ireland. He would,therefore, propose that the Minister of Health should return to dublin and should speak to Mr. de Valera on the following lines :  His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that there is no possibility of making your country safe against german invasion, of which it stands in imminent danger at present,unless (i) you give the British Navy the use of the IrishAtlantic ports;(ii) you allow our troops and Air forces to enter the twenty-six Counties before the invasion occurs;and(iii) you secure yourself against the dangers of fifth column activities by interning all the leaders of theLB.A. still at large, as well as any suspiciousGermans and Italians at present in this country(we should not press them necessarily to severdiplomatic relations with Germany).The Minister of Health would go on to ask whether, inreturn for these measures, Mr. de Valera would be content toaccept a declaration stating that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere, in principle, in favour of the establishment of a UnitedIreland. This would naturally have to be followed by an. approach to Lord Craigavon, who would have to be told thatthe interests of Northern Ireland could not be allowed to stand against the vital interests of the British Empire. lord craigavon would naturally ask whether the United ireland would form part of the British Empire. The answer to thiswas clearly in the affirmative, though of course full dominion status carried with it the right to secede from the Common-wealth.Should Mr. de Valera still maintain a negative attitude,the Minister of Health should insist that the proposition shouldbe put to his Government, some members of which he (the lord president) understood were likely to take a less rigid view.If the Irish Governments refusal were still maintained, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be on stronger ground vis-a-vis the
United States of America, if later on they were compelled to use force. He understood that the Chiefs of Staff had not yet studiedthe question whether we could successfully occupy the Irish ports in the face of resistance and thought that this question should receiveearly consideration.The Prime Minister, while agreeing generally with the lord president, said that we must avoid putting undue pressure on theloyal province of Ulster. He would not urge those who had workedself-government loyally within the Empire to join with those who wished to stay outside it. He was not convinced that the militarysituation was so serious as it had been represented. He was infavour of allowing the enemy to make the first move; if theysucceeded in establishing themselves in Ireland our forces should then be ready to pounce upon them. The whole of Ireland, including mr.. de Valera, would in those circumstances be on our side.The Lord President of the Council said that he had suggested the possibility of urging this course very strongly upon NorthernIreland only because he was impressed with the dangers to thiscountry which might follow a successful invasion of Ireland.The Lord Privy Seal said that a German invasion would furnish the best chance of securing a united Ireland, and he saw no advantage in attempting to coerce either Northern Ireland or Eireby force.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shared the views expressed by the Lord Pri^y Seal, and suggested that the Ministerof Health should return to Dublin where he could continue theprocess of educating Mr. de Valera as to the dangers of invasion,at the same time exploring to what extent any advance towards a United Ireland would help Mr. de Valera in dealing with Irishopinion on this matter. If anything useful came out of these conversations, it would, of course, have to be put to Lord Craigavon.The Minister without Portfolio thought that, after theexperience which this country had had of air-raids during the two previous nights, the Irish people would be in little doubt as to the determination&apos; of Germany to concentrate attacks on this Island.American public opinion was a decisive argument against a forcibleseizure of the Irish Ports.The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security said that the Irish people were resolute fighters,and he thought that they would be capable of dealing withparachutists or airborne invasion. Difficulties might arise in thecase of a seaborne attack, and he suggested that the Irish mightbe advised to protect their ports by mines, net, and boom defences,which would create difficulties for the invader. He thought thatit was impossible to coerce either Northern or Southern Ireland,and that it was unlikely that any substantial advance could be made towards the project of a United Ireland.The War Cabinet agreed To invite the Minister of Health to resume his conversa-tions with Mr. de Valera on the lines suggested by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
