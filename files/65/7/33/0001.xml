The western front.Progress of operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 137thConclusions,Minute 1.)telegrams between thePrime Ministerand M. Reynaud.Calais.1. The Prime Minister said that at about midnight on theprevious night he had had a telegram from M. Reynaud (No. 271DIPP) saying that the British Army was no longer conforming toGeneral Weygand&apos;s plan and had withdrawn towards the channel ports. At that time we had had no information of any such move on Lord Gort&apos;s part. After consulting the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, he had sent a reply to M. Revnaud (telegram No 200DIPP) to the following effect :-We believed that Lord Gort was still persevering in the southward move. All we knew was that he had been forced by pressure on his right flank to place parts of two divisions between himself and the German armoured forces. Should we become aware that extreme pressure had compelled any departure from the agreedplan, we should at once inform M. Reynaud.Later, however, a Staff Officer had reported to the War Officeconfirming the withdrawal of two Divisions from the Arras area.No doubt the action taken had been forced on Lord Gort by theposition in which he had found himself. Nevertheless, he should at once have informed us of the action which he had taken, and theFrench had grounds for complaint. But this was no time forrecriminations. General Dill had been instructed to send a StaffOfficer back to this country with a report at the earliest possible moment. In the meantime, we must tell the French that the reportedwithdrawal had now been confirmed.(A telegram in this sense was drafted and despatched toM. Reynaud (No. 205 DIPP).)The Lord President of the Council hoped that no hastyjudgment would be passed on Lord Gort&apos;s failure to keep theGovernment informed. There might be some explanation for hisapparent omission to let us know what he was doing.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave the War cabinet a brief explanation of the military situation. It seemed certainthat Lord Gort&apos;s communications had been almost completelysevered. Only the line to Dunkirk remained. A force which hadbeen sent out from Calais had been held up at Cassel. A very dangerous attack was developing against the Belgian Army nearCourtrai, only a very small number of French troops south of the gap had as yet crossed the Somme, and the French were only holdingthe southern part of Amiens and the outskirts of Peronne. He had sent a message to Lord Gort in the briefest terms possible asking him to say whether he was (i) advancing on the ports, (ii) advancingon Amiens, or (iii) fighting it out on his present position.The Prime Minister said that he had had a conversation withVice-Admiral Sir James Somerville, who had landed at Calais theprevious night from a destroyer which had also landed 60 royal marines and a quantity of ammunition. He had seen the senior naval and Military Officers, who had been in good heart and were putting up a stout defence. Only three of our tanks remained, butwe had accounted for a large number of German tanks. - It wasimperative that we should hold on to Calais, and he had arranged for a heartening message to be sent to our forces.Admiral Somerville was returning to Calais that night with additional supplies, including trench mortars.The Secretary of State for War referred to the French official statement that they were still holding Calais. As there were 3,000British troops and only 800 French troops in the port, it was only fair to the British public that they should be told that Britishtroops were playing a big part in the gallant defence of Calais. Hesuggested that an announcement should be made that Calais was strongly held by an Anglo-French Force.[21339] b 2
The Minister of Information undertook to issue a statement tothis effect.Movement of The Secretary of State for War said that we had had to supply-ammunition and the British Expeditionary Force from stocks in this country. Asstores from base a result, our reserves of ammunition in the United Kingdom haddepots in been depleted, and the Quartermaster-General was anxious to makeFrance. them up by drawing on the reserves at the bases in France.   Therewere ships at the base ports ready to load these stores at once. Inview of French feeling, however, this course might present some difficulty.The Prime Minister thought that we should await further news from Lord Gort before taking a decision on this matter.The War Cabinet agreed That, pending further news of the situation of the british expeditionary Force, steps should not be taken towithdraw reserves of ammunition from the bases inFrance. In the meantime, the ships should be kept standing by in the ports.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 137thConclusions,Minute 2.)The western front.Attacks onGermanshipping.Enemy attacks on the UnitedKingdom.2. The Chief of the Air Staff gave the War Cabinet detailsof attacks which had been made during the day by our aircraft on german forces in the Boulogne-Calais area, in which several direct hits had been made on German columns and concentrations. Inthe evening 24 Blenheims had found a large number of vehiclesheld up on the road by the destruction of the bridge at Gravelines,but it had been too dark at the time to see the result of their attack.Swordfish aircraft had made a very successful attack on tankson the Calais-Gravelines road during the evening, three tankshaving been set on fire.Fifty-nine heavy bombers had been out during the nightattacking targets in the rear areas of the German armies, and all had returned safety. Columns had been bombed in the Louvain-Tirlemont area and near Namur. Train movements had been attacked in the Roermond-Coblenz-Luxembourg-Maastricht area.These attacks had been very successful in paralysing all trainmovement. Dumps and marshalling yards in the Ruhr had alsobeen attacked.Aircraft of the Fighter Command had been very active overthe French coast and the B.E.F. area. Thirty enemy aircraft forcertain (and more unconfirmed) had been shot down. Twelve of our fighters were missing, but it was probable that not all of the pilotshad been lost as some of the missing aircraft had been seen on thenorthern French shore.Shipping in the Ems estuary had been attacked. Salvagevessels had been observed working on three wrecks in the mouth ofthe Ems, one of which was thought to be a warship. One Blenheimhad been lost in the Bight on a reconnaissance.Mines had been laid in the Ems estuary, and the remainingoil tanks at Rotterdam had again been bombed.A certain number of enemy aircraft had come in over ourshores the previous night with our own bombers. They had notbeen recognised as enemy aircraft until they had actually droppedtheir bombs, which had fallen in Yorkshire and East Anglia, mainly on aerodromes. Some bombs had been dropped on Middlesbrough,but the damage and casualties were very slight.
The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 137thConclusions,Minute 3.)Navalcasualties.Demolitions andblockships atZeebrugge.(previous reference:W.M. (40) .137thConclusions,Minute 1.)Reportedsinking ofLutzow (ex-Deutschland).Promise ofCanadiandestrovers.3. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet of thefollowing casualties to H.M. ships off the Channel ports :  Wessex bombed and sunk.Polish destroyer Burza hit by 2 bombs but returning toPortsmouth.Vimiera extensive damage caused by a near miss andwill require docking.French demolitions at Zeebrugge had been expected to becarried out at 8 p.m. on the 24th May. The blockships had arrived in the early hours of the 25th May and had been sunk in the channel,but they had been unable to get right up to the lock gates.The submarine Spearfish had reported that she had taken offthe crews and sunk two Danish fishing vessels on the 20th May.The Danes had confirmed the time and place of her attack on aGerman warship, which they stated to have been the Lutzow(ex Deutschland). They said she had been beached nearFrederikshavn, but after being refloated had sunk in Kiel Bay.The Greek ship Kyma (3,994 tons) had been sunk in the Channelapproaches; survivors had been picked up by H.M.S. Enchantress.The Canadian Government had undertaken to send the 4Canadian destroyers to the United Kingdom.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had sent a suitable message of thanks to the Canadian Government.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Norway.Progress of operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 137thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The First Sea Lord read the first part of a telegram received from Lord Cork to the effect that an attack in the Narvikarea had had to be postponed owing to the deterioration of thesituation at Bodo, which necessitated the despatch of additionalguns and stores. French and Norwegian troops, however, were making good progress in the Narvik area. Lord Cork had asked that H.M.S. Resolution, which had returned to this country forminor repairs, should return to Narvik as early as possible.The coaster Bjarkoy had been sunk by a bomb near Narvik.The supply ships Balteako and Mashobra and 4 trawlers had beenbeached after damage.A record of the further discussion, and of the conclusions reached, on operations in the Narvik area is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by the first sea Lord.Air RaidPrecautions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 118thConclusions,Minute 5.)Use of steelshelters.5. In connection with the discussion recorded in Minute 2,the Prime Minister said that the bombing by the enemy of targets in this country should give a welcome stimulus to air-raidprecautions activities. He had noticed several reports in the press that Anderson shelters were not being properly used by the public.The Minister of Home Security said that the number of suchcases was almost negligible, and the Press reports were muchexaggerated. Some cases had occurred of the materials for sheltersbeing left lying about while awaiting missing components. In other cases, there had been no able-bodied person in the household whoT21339]b 3
could erect the shelter. Local authorities had been given stringentinstructions to remove shelters which were not erected, and to give them to other householders who were in need of them.The Prime Minister urged that this was not enough; the persons responsible should be punished in some way. The Government hadthe necessary powers under the new Act.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister for Home Security (i) to secure that some form of penal action was taken against persons who failed to make proper use ofsteel shelters provided for their protection;(ii) to consider the issue of a public statement on thismatter.Italy.Possible plan forblocking the suez Canal.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 137thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The First Sea Lord said that the Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, who had been given the option of blocking the suez Canal to stop the Italian aircraft carrier Maraglia, had decided to take no action in the matter.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to asignal received from the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, inwhich he stated that he intended to arrange for the stoppage of italian traffic through the Canal when the situation appeared tohim to be critical. The Foreign Secretary suggested that theCommander-in-Chief should be instructed to refer to theAdmiralty before taking such action.The War Cabinet-Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to instruct theCommander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, to refer to london for instructions before taking action to stop Italian trafficthrough the Canal; and to consult with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs before issuing such instructions.Italy. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionMilitary plans in to Rome telegram No. 646, dated the 23rd May, reporting suggestionsthe event of as to the probable tactics to be adopted by the Italian Navy in the participation in   &quot; Coming war.&quot;the war. The First Lord might think it desirable to let the Naval Staffsee this telegram.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadFrench proposal now replied to the French Governments suggestion that Presidentfor another Roosevelt should be asked to make another approach to Signorapproach by Mussolini (telegram No. 198 DIPP to Paris).president roosevelt to signor mussolini.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 137thConclusions,Minute 7.)
Sir Eobert At the invitation of a third party, a meeting had taken placeVansittarfs between Sir Robert Vansittart and a member of the staff of the conversation Italian Embassy in London. The Italian diplomat, alleging that hewith a member Was speaking without instructions, had said that there were stillof the Italian a great many influential-people in Italy who desired to see a peacefulEmbassy. solution of the Mediterranean problem.   If His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment saw their way to make an approach to the Italian Government,with a view to exploring the possibilities of a friendly settlement,there need be no fear of their meeting with a rebuff.After consulting the Prime Minister, the Foreign secretary had been authorised to pursue the matter further. After some little delay (which might indicate consultations between the ItalianEmbassy and Rome), a reply had been received by Sir RobertVansittant accepting an invitation to a second meeting.The Foreign Secretary suggested that at this second conversa-tion Sir Robert might take the line that we had contemplatedmaking a statement on Anglo-Italian relations, but had abandonedour intention because of the unhelpful reply which Signor mussolini had sent to the Prime Minister&apos;s letter. We knew that the italians had become aware that such a statement had been contemplated.Sir Robert might say that our decision not to proceed with thestatement might have given rise to some misunderstanding in Italy.We were now, as always, willing to enter into discussions with theItalian Government with a view to putting an end to the difficulties and misunderstandings which blocked the path of friendshipbetween the two peoples. The Foreign Secretary thought, however,that he was entitled to ask for some assurance that a demarche onhis part would not meet with a rebuff.Very likely nothing might come of all this. Nevertheless, evenif the result were merely to gain time, it would be valuable. TheFrench would certainly be pleased with such a move on the part ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, which was in line with their own policy.The Prime Minister said that he saw no objection to an approach of the character suggested. It must not, of course, be accompanied by any publicity, since that would amount to a con-fession of weakness. It was very probable that at any momentSignor Mussolini might put very strong pressure on the French,with a view to obtaining concessions from them. The fact that theFrench were denuding their Italian frontier of troops put them ina very weak bargaining position.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Approved the line which the Foreign Secretary proposed totake.National Day of 9. The Prime Minister reminded his colleagues that thePrayer. following day, Sunday, the 26th May, had been appointed as a service at National Day of Prayer. There was to be a service in WestminsterWestminster Abbey, attended by the King and Queen. For security reasons,Abbey. however, the attendance of Their Majesties was not being announced in advance, nor were any special arrangements being made to invitethe attendance of members of both Houses of Parliament.It was, however, desired to arrange for the attendance of as many members of His Majesty&apos;s Government as possible. TheSecretary of the War Cabinet would, therefore, send a writtennotification of the time of the service to all Ministers, includingUnder-Secretaries, and inform the Dean of Westminster how many places should be reserved.The War Cabinet-Approved the Prime Ministers suggestion.
Invasion ofGreat Britain.security measures.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 137thConclusions,Minute 12.)Suggestedevacuation of towns on Southand South-eastCoasts.Restriction of movement ofthe CivilPopulation.France.Suggested Italo-German offer ofa separate peace.10. The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Vice-Chiefs ofStaff had prepared certain recommendations, which they wished toplace before the War Cabinet, in regard to (1) the education of the public as to the attitude to adopt inthe event of invasion;(2) the evacuation of children, pregnant women and old persons from the South and South-East Coasts.There was also the question of the Sunday exodus of motorcars to the South and East coasts, which might give the enemy anopportunity of seizing motor transport.The War Cabinet agreed : -To remit these recommendations to a Meeting of ministers and Chiefs of Staff to be held at 5-30 p.m. that day.11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Madrid telegram No. 225 DIPP, dated the 24th May, reportinga conversation between Queen Ena&apos;s Chamberlain and a Member ofthe Embassy Staff. The Chamberlain had said that he had learnedfrom a highly placed Falangist, to whom the Germans had talked,that it was the German plan that Italy should immediately offer aseparate peace to France, on the basis that she kept her presentEuropean frontiers, while Italy received Tunis, and Spain receivedGibraltar and French Morocco. France was to stand aside whileGermany proceeded to blockade and invade England, which theGermans were convinced they could do. The offer would be accompanied by an ultimatum that Italy would attack if it werenot accepted.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Norway.Swedishproposal for a cessation ofhostilities inNorthernNorway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 135thConclusions,Minute 9.)The King of the belgians.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 137thConclusions,Minute 5.)12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Foreign Office telegram to Stockholm No. 448, dated the 24thMay, reporting a message from Sir Cecil Dormer to the effectthat the Norwegian Government were unwilling to consider theSwedish proposal for a cessation of hostilities in Northern Norway.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.13. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet of a message which he had received from Admiral Sir Roger Keyes asto the movements of the King of the Belgians.A record of the discussion, and of the conclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.
U.S.S.R.Appointment ofa british ambassador.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 132ndConclusions,Minute 8.)14. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that sir Stafford Cripps&apos;s Mission to Moscow made it necessary toconsider whether we should allow the position to continue in whichwe had no Ambassador at Moscow. It was a question of balancingrisks, but he thought that, on the whole, we ought now to have an ambassador at Moscow. The arguments in favour of this coursewere as follows : (i) The Russians seemed at present to be in the mood to welcome a friendly gesture from us.(ii) They were believed to be sore over the absence of a british ambassador, and it was important that everything possible should be done to give the Cripps Mission a chance of success. To send a special Mission, but not an ambassador, might make matters worse rather thanbetter.(iii) In the event of the failure of the Cripps Mission, it wouldbe more difficult to appoint an Ambassador than itwas now.The Home Secretary asked whether this step need make anychange in the policy adopted towards Communists in Great Britain.The view taken was that no change need be made, since the SovietGovernment treated their diplomatic relations and propagandaactivities as wholly distinct matters.The War Cabinet agreed That it was desirable to appoint a British Ambassador to moscow without delay.B.B.C.Action in theevent of an air attack.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 120thConclusions,Minute 3.)B&quot;15. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Information regarding the action to be taken by theB.B.C. in the event of an air attack on this country (W.P. (G.)(40) 136).The Minister of Information said that he had reluctantlyaccepted the view of the Air Staff that the B.B.C. should be requiredtemporarily to close down all existing transmitters in this country during an air raid, except for certain short-wave transmissions, inview of the danger of affording direction-finding assistance toraiding aircraft. The proposals in his paper made it clear that,apart from the overriding authority given to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, to broadcast orders to troops, and the instruc-tions to be given by Fighter Command Headquarters for the resumption of transmissions, Government instructions to the B.B.C.were to be given only through the Ministry of Information.The Secretary of State for Air thought it would be much better to discontinue broadcasting altogether during an air raid, unlessthe technical experts, who were meeting that afternoon, were ableto advise that means had been found to obviate the risk of enemyinterference by the issue of false news or announcements purporting to issue from the B.B.C. itself. If, as seemed likely, it was nottechnically possible to prevent the enemy from doing this, the right course was that the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, should onlybroadcast instructions in code to specified recipients..The Secretary of State for War suggested that the authority given to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, to broadcast orders to troops should not be limited to the case of parachutists landing in this country, but should apply in the case of an enemy landing byany means.
The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Minister of Information, &quot;asset out in paragraph 4 of his Memorandum, subject to the modifications  suggested  at   &quot; A &quot;   and   &quot; B &quot;   in  thediscussion recorded above.Invasion ofGreat Britain.security measures.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 138thConclusions,Minute 10.)16. The Lord President of the Council said that he under-stood that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had a numberof proposals to make which he thought would be useful with regardto the preparations now in hand for the Defence of Great Britainagainst hostile attack. He would therefore propose that theCommander-in-Chief, Home Forces, should be invited to consult theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster at an early stage.The War Cabinet approved the above proposal.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,May 25, 1940.
