The War Effort.additional powers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 128thConclusions,Minute 1.)Powers overlocalauthorities.1. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Lord President of the Council on Additional Powers(W.P. (40) 162). Attached to this Memorandum (Appendix II)was a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService on Supply of Labour.The Lord President of the Council informed the War Cabinetthat, in view of the very grave news from France and of thedifficulty of knowing exactly what was taking place in that country,the Prime Minister had decided to go to France, and was now onhis way to Paris to meet M. Reynaud and General Weygand.During his absence, the Prime Minister had requested that he(the Lord President of the Council) should take his place.The Lord President of the Council said that the PrimeMinister had authorised him to say that he would endorse whatever decision might be taken in his absence in regard to the assumption of such additional powers by the Government as might be considered necessary to meet the present situation.The first of these powers concerned the approval of defence regulation No. 54 B giving powers over local authorities. Thismatter had been discussed on the previous evening by a Committeewhich included all the Members of the War Cabinet, with theexception of the Prime Minister, and it had been unanimously agreed to submit the Regulation to His Majesty for approval. Allthat was required, therefore, was that the War Cabinet shouldformally endorse this decision.This was agreed to.Powers over Turning  to his  Memorandum  (W.P. (40)   162),  the Lordpersons and President drew attention to the proposals of the Memorandum byproperty. the Minister  of  Labour   and  National  Service  contained  inAppendix II. These proposals had been drawn up at a time whenthe situation was not quite so grave. He, himself, felt that events had now outstripped these proposals, and that the present situationdemanded that the Government should be given forthwith full powers and that Parliament should, therefore, be asked that day to pass a Bill through all its stages, enabling the Government toexercise complete powers of persons and property on the lines suggested in his Memorandum. He did not think that the public would take this amiss. Indeed, he thought that at this, the gravestmoment in our history, they would regard anything less asinsufficient.The Lord President then gave information as to the seriousness of the situation. It was clear that the drive towards the channel ports presaged an attack on this country very shortly. Our powerto withstand this attack would depend not only on a strong air force,but also on adequate anti-aircraft defences. In this connection the appeal to the aircraft industry by the Minister of aircraft production was all to the good, but the times demanded that his proposals should be applied to the whole range of war industry.Moreover, the essence of the problem was that, behind this appeal,the Government should be given powers in order to ensure that therewas no slackness or hesitation, and to confer upon the authorities the knowledge that their orders must be obeyed.The Lord Privy Seal and the Minister without Portfolio, with whom he had discussed this matter just before the Meeting, had agreed that these powers should be obtained at once.He proposed that these powers should be secured by a oneClause Bill, which had already been drafted. By means of some special procedure motion, it would be possible to pass this bill through all its stages during that afternoon.[21321a]b 2
The Minister of Labour and National Service trusted that theuse of the word &apos;&apos; labour &apos;&apos; should not be introduced into the bill as this would create the wrong impression psychologically byinferring that labour was separate from citizenship.The Lord President of the Council read the relevant passagesof the Bill which was so drafted as to meet this point.As regards the proposals put forward by the Minister ofLabour for the approval of his colleagues in paragraph 14 of his memorandum (Appendix II to W.P. (40) 162), the Lord Presidentof the Council pointed out that those contained in sub-paragraphs(iii), (viii) and (xii) would no longer be required, in view of the wider powers which it had now been decided that the Governmentshould secure. Apart from these points, he suggested that theproposals of the Minister of Labour should be endorsed.There was general agreement with this view and the minister without Portfolio was invited to act as Chairman of the production council contemplated under these proposals.* In regard to thesuggestion in the Memorandum that the Mines Department andthe Ministry of Agriculture might be represented on the Council,it was generally agreed that this would be desirable.In answer to questions by the Minister of Labour, the lord president of the Council explained that the powers which it was proposed that the Government should acquire would give control,not only over industries directly concerned with war production,but over any industries which it might be &quot; expedient for theconduct of the war &quot; to control. Power would also be given to indemnify employers in the matter of broken contracts.In answer to a question by the President of the Board of Trade,the Lord President of the Council suggested that the immediatebuilding up of our fighting strength must have a paramount claim on all our resources, and that the requirements of the export trade or any other matters of long-term policy must take second place.There was general agreement with this view.The Minister of Labour pointed out that it was important toavoid unemployment arising from a switch-over of production fromthe export trade. The President of the Board of Trade undertook to bear this point in mind.There was a short discussion as to the extent to which it wouldbe desirable to expound in any detail in Parliament the contents ofthe Memoranda by the Lord President of the Council and theMinister of Labour, which formed the basis of the Government&apos;request for additional powers.The Lord President of the Council suggested that for the mostpart he thought that the statement made should be in fairly general terms. As regards his Memorandum, it was particularly important to emphasize that the remuneration where persons were required tocarry out any given work would be &quot; the rate for the job &quot; subjectto special consideration in cases where additional expenditure was involved.The War Cabinet agreed  (1) That the gravity of the present situation justified theimmediate assumption by the Government of completepowers over persons and property, on the general lines proposed in the Memorandum by the Lord President ofthe Council (W.P. (40) 162).(2) That the powers under (1) above should be secured by ashort Bill which should be passed through all its stages in both Houses of Parliament that afternoon.* A meeting of this Production Council was arranged for 6&apos;15 p.m. thatsame day.
The Western 2.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theFront. British Expeditionary Force were still holding their position on theProgress of Escaut. Owing to a breakdown in communications, no recent operations. information had been received direct from General Headquarters,(Previous anc^ ^or ^s reason we had no news of the outcome of general reference- Weygand&apos;s conference with Lord Gort. It was known, however,WM (40) 132nd ^hat General Billotte had been injured in a motor accident and had conclusions Deen replaced. It was to be hoped that this would not lead to minute 1) &apos;      further delays in co-ordination.The German armoured column which had been advancing onBoulogne the previous day had penetrated no further than the riverCanche, where it had been heavily attacked by us from the air.There had been a report of parachute landings on the St. Omeraerodrome, but this had not yet been confirmed. General Brownrigghad reported that morning that it had been a comparatively quietnight in Boulogne. All roads leading to it had been blocked andthe influx of refugees stopped.The Officer in command at Calais had reported all well and thecoast road to Dunkerque open. An earlier report of a bridge on thisroad having been destroyed was without foundation.The following reinforcements had been, or were being, sent tothe Boulogne-Calais area to secure the ports : Two Guards battalions with an anti-tank battery, which left this country the previous evening, had landed in Boulogneearly that morning.A Territorial battalion was leaving for Calais that morning.An anti-tank battery was leaving Dover for Dunkerque at noon, and another anti-tank battery was being sent by theHarwich ferry early that morning.A tank regiment of the Armoured Division, which hadbeen embarked en route for Cherbourg, had been diverted toCalais.(3) That this Bill should also make provision for the extensionof the Emergency Powers Act, 1939 (which was due to expire in August 1940), for one more year.(4) That consideration should be given to the question whetherthe Bill should include a provision enabling the Act tobe amended by Order in Council, in so far as such amend-ment was necessary for the prosecution of the war.(5) That the proposals contained in the Memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (Appendix IIto W.P. (40) 162) should be approved excepting as regardsthe recommendations in paragraphs 14 (iii), (viii) and(xii), which would no longer be required in view of the wider powers which would be assumed by the Govern-ment under (1) and (2) above.(6) That the Production Council proposed in paragraph 14 (ii)of the Memorandum by the Minister of Labour shouldbe set up forthwith under the Chairmanship of theMinister without Portfolio, and should include repre-sentatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and of the mines Department.(7) That in existing circumstances war industries must have aparamount claim on all our resources, and that the requirement of long-term plans and of the export trademust take second place.(8) That, in giving effect to (7) every endeavour should be madeto regulate the switch-over so as to avoid unemploymentin industries engaged on the export trade.(9) That Defence Regulation 54 B should be submitted forth-with for the approval of His Majesty in Council.
The two Regular battalions of motorised infantry which formed part of the Armoured Division would be sent to Calaisor Boulogne, as the situation dictated, early the followingEvacuation ofthe BelgianGovernment.Air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 132ndConclusions,Minute 1.)When these troops had arrived in the Boulogne area, we shouldhave a force there which could take effective action againstarmoured columns.Emergency arrangements were being made for the feeding ofthe British Expeditionary Force. A trainload of rations had leftBoulogne the previous day, and further supplies were being put intoCalais and Boulogne. Eighty thousand iron rations were being sentto Croydon aerodrome for despatch by air at once.The Chief of the Air Staff said that civil aircraft were beingimpressed for the transport of these rations.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theBelgian Ambassador had called on him just before the meeting andhad informed him that there were four Cabinet Ministers, as wellas the King and his Staff, at Bruges, and their evacuation was an urgent necessity. They could not get through to France and wouldhave to be taken off to England first. The total party would amountto about 50. Nieuport had been suggested as the port ofembarkation.The First Sea Lord undertook to try and make arrangementsfor the evacuation of the party. Arrangements would have to beconcerted with Sir Roger Keyes, who was with the King of the belgians.The Secretary of State for War read to the. War Cabinet a message which had been received from Sir Roger Keyes, stressingthe wish of the Belgian Army to maintain contact with the british expeditionary Force, and the determination of the King to remain with his Army, which he hoped it might be possible to re-form inFrance. It seemed that the King himself did not wish to be evacuated with members of his Government.The Chief of the Air Staff reported that, following recon-naissance in the early morning by two Blenheims, a number of attacks were made during the previous day on enemy mechanisedcolumns and troop movements.Twelve Blenheims had left at 8-30 a.m. to attack columnsadvancing at Abbeville and had attacked troops and transport atAuxi-le-Chateau. All the roads west of this town Were packed with transport, and the enemy could not be distinguished.Nine Blenheims had left at 11-30 a.m. to attack columns on theroad Montreuil-Etaples-Boulogne. Heavy enemy concentrationsbad been attacked at Montreuil. The afternoon reconnaissancefailed to return, but at 4-50 p.m. 23 Blenheims had left to attackcolumns on the roads between Montreuil and Boulogne. Thepresence of refugees had hampered the action of the bombers, buta number of attacks had been successful.Fourteen more Blenheims had left shortly before 7 p.m. and had attacked large columns of motorised troops between Etaples andBoulogne, on the road and in the Foret de Hardelot. Attacks had also been made on similar columns between Nesles and Camiers.During the night 47 Wellingtons had attacked successfullyroads and bridges across the Meuse at Namur, Dinant and Aachen.A rail reconnaissance had reported that no movements had been seenbetween midnight and 1 a.m. at Liege, Maastricht and Aachen.Twenty-five Hampdens had left to derail trains on railways west ofthe Rhine.  Reports were awaited.Forty-eight Whitleys had attaeked successfully railway centres,workshops and marshalling yards in the Ruhr.   These were all
Air Operations. 3.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that there had been littleEnemy enemy activity off our coasts during the previous day.   During the activity night there had been one track off Harwich, and sound plots in theagainst the neighbourhood of Reading and in the Home Counties. ShippingUnited had been attacked in the Downs on a ten-mile front.   Bombs wereKingdom. reported to have been dropped at Deal and Harwich.   These might,however, have been mines exploding on contact.Yellow warnings had been given during the previous night in a number of districts, including London, Brighton, Canterburyand Colchester.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.4.   The First Sea Lord reported that 30 officers and 440 ratingsof the French Navy had arrived at Folkestone from Boulogne andhad  asked  for  accommodation.    They  had   been  sent  on  toW.M. (40) 132nd Portsmouth.    The Commander-in-Charge, Portsmouth, had sentConclusions,      them back to Boulogne.Minute 14.) Refugees were arriving in boats of every description offNewhaven. Those in seaworthy boats were being sent to receptionports further West; the remainder were anchored under the cliffstill a reception ship could be provided for them.The Home Secretary asked that he might be given the longestpossible notice of the destination to which the reception ship wouldtake the refugees. It was very important that he should have timeto make proper arrangements for them.War Refugees.(previous reference:targets which had been notified to us by General Georges. Extensivetroop movements were seen on the road Venlo-Roermonde, movingsouth.Dunkerque and Boulogne had been bombed during the previous day. Eighty-six aircraft had been employed on offensive patrol andescort work. Seven enemy aircraft had been reported shot down,with three more unconfirmed.Our total losses during the day had been 14 aircraft (8 bombers and 6 fighters).Owing to failure of communications, no information had beenreceived from the Advanced Air Striking Force.As the Cabinet had already been informed, part of the rationsfor the B.E.F. were now being supplied by air. The rations werebeing flown for the most part in civil aircraft. Some 30 or 40 tonsof food could be provided a day in this way.Ostend and The First Sea Lord reported that the blockships for Ostend andZeebrugge.        Zeebrugge were still being held at short notice.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above arrangements.(ii) Invited the First Sea Lord to make arrangements for theevacuation from a Belgian port to England of the king of the Belgians, members of the Belgian Governmentand the party accompanying them.
Norway. 5.   The First Sea Lord said that the Gladiators had flown offOperations at the Furious on the previous day. The Funous and the Glorious,Narvik. the latter with the Hurricanes still on board, were returning to(Previous Scapa.   The Glorious would not return to the Narvik area untilReference:        sne na(^ received fresh orders from the Admiralty.W.M. (40) 132ndConclusions,Minute 3.)Message from The First Sea Lord said that Lord Cork had now replied toLord Cork. the Admiralty signal, giving him a strong indication of the urgency(Previous of clearing up Narvik at the earliest possible moment.   Lord CorkReference:        said that he fully understood the urgency of the occupation of w.M. (40) 131st Narvik.   The most important work at the moment, however, was conclusions,      the completion and protection of the aerodromes, for which all the minute 4.)        landing craft were required.   In his view it would be folly in existing conditions to switch off from the preparation of the aerodromes, delay in regard to which was dangerous, to attackNarvik, an assault on which could be carried out quite soon.The Prime Minister had sent an interim reply to Lord Corkon the previous evening to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentrealised the local difficulties and noted that Lord Cork would attempt the capture of Narvik as soon as the equipment of the aerodromes was completed.A telegram from General Auchinleck had also come in. TheChiefs of Staff now had the necessary material on which to work,and they hoped to be in a position to submit a recommendation tothe War Cabinet later in the day.The Foreign Secretary thought that it would be helpful if theChiefs of Staff could also consider the Swedish proposal for a cessation of hostilities in Northern Norway. For this purpose hewould like a representative of his Department to attend the meeting.This was agreed to.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Spain.Attitudetowardsevacuation of gibraltar.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 129thConclusions,Minute 9.)Sir samuel hoare&apos;mission.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 131stConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad received a telegram (No. 213, dated the 21st May, 1940) fromHis Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires, Madrid, reporting that theSpanish Foreign Minister, whom he had seen the previous night, was already aware of our decision to evacuate civilians from Gibraltar,and was in no wise concerned thereat. He agreed that Gibraltarhad been unhealthily crowded for some time and offered to give any assistance that might be useful, as, for example, by grantingcollective visas.The Foreign Secretary said that he had no news at presentregarding the attitude of the Spanish Government towards thedespatch to Madrid of a special Mission under Sir Samuel Hoare; he proposed to telegraph to Mr. Yencken asking him to do everything possible to expedite the Spanish Governments decision in thismatter.
7. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs drew attentionto telegram No. 241 DIPP, dated the 21st May, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, reporting that M. Daladier had informed him that he was turning over in his mind the possibilityof opening negotiations with Italy with a view to making immediateconcessions. Sir Ronald Campbell had done his best to discouragethis idea, and had undertaken to see that it was not carried very farwithout consultation with the Secretary of State.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.A.R.P.Services.Question ofcontinuedemploymentof certainaliens, &amp;c.8. The CMef of the Air Staff said that at their meeting that morning the Chiefs of Staff&apos; Committee had had before them a reportshowing the number of aliens employed on A.R.P. Services. Inall, there were some 1,742 such persons employed in the UnitedKingdom, of whom 1,092 were employed in London. These figuresexcluded naturalised aliens or female aliens who had acquiredBritish nationality by marriage. There were also a number of aliensemployed in key factories. The Chiefs of Staff Committee took so serious a view of this matter that they thought it their duty to bring it before the War Cabinet that morning.The Secretary of State for the Home Department said that themembers of the A.R.P. Services were employed not by his Depart-ment, but by local authorities. Hitherto the employment of aliens inthese Services had not been discouraged, subject to a proper scrutiny of the reliability of persons so employed. In this matter he hadbased his practice on that adopted by the War Office in the recruit-ment, for example, of pioneer formations, &amp;c. Some time previouslyhe had called for a return of all aliens employed in such Services. on receipt of this return some two or three days ago, he had given instructions that, as a precautionary measure, all aliens should be eliminated from positions of special trust for example, in controlcentres or in positions of leadership. This decision was beingcarried out as a matter of urgency. In districts such as the EastEnd, where there was a large alien population,&apos;it was of value tohave some aliens in services like the Wardens&apos; service in order topacify and calm their fellow-aliens in time of emergency.As regards key factories, no action, so far as he was aware, hadbeen taken, except that instructions had been given for the issue ofan order that, if war with Italy became imminent, Italiansemployed should be stood off in the precautionary period. It wouldbe understood that such establishments were not under his control.The Lord President of the Council invited the Home Secretaryto take up as a matter of urgency with the Minister of Supply, theMinister of Health and other Ministers concerned the question ofterminating the employment of aliens in key factories and similarestablishments.The War Cabinet approved the Lord Presidents proposal9. The Secretary of State for the Home Department gave particulars of evidence which had been discovered which showed that the leader of a certain organisation had been concerned insubversive activity. Particulars of this information and the ensuing discussion are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofWar Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for the Home Department, inconjunction with the Law Officers, to consider as amatter   of   urgency   whether   the   man   principally[21321a] cSubversiveActivity.Suggestedconcessionsto Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 106thConclusions,Minute 6.)
implicated should be interned only (in which case hecould be freely interrogated), or whether he should be prosecuted (in which case he could not be interrogated).(2) Authorised him in the light of the consultation referred toin (1) to take such action as seemed appropriate inregard to persons known to have been members of theorganisation. Prima facie, the War Cabinet favoured the view that action should be taken against these persons.Aliens and the 10.   In view of the information disclosed in the discussion onFifth Column, the previous Minute, the question was raised whether we couldBritish afford to wait any longer before taking action in regard to british union of Fascists.Fascists. pjie Secretary of State for the Home Department and Minister(Previous of Home Security said that he had been asked by the Prime minister reference:        to raise the matter with the Cabinet that morning.   He had had aW.M. (40) 128th long talk with two officers of M.I. 5, who had devoted specialConclusions,      attention over many years to the Fascist Organisation.   They had minute 3.)        been unable to produce any evidence, on which action could be based,showing that either the Leaders of the Organisation or the Organisa-tion itself had anything to do with what might be called fifth column activities.   There was indeed some evidence in the otherdirection, as, for example, Sir Oswald Mosley&apos;s recent instruction in A ction to the members of the Organisation.The two officers of M.I. 5 to whom he had referred had givenit as their opinion that a certain proportion of the members of theOrganisation, say, 25-30 per cent., would be willing, if ordered, togo to any lengths.The Home Secretary said that his own view was that SirOswald Mosley, although a most mischievous person, was too cleverto put himself in the wrong by giving treasonable orders.The Home Secretary said that he realised that the War cabinet might take the view that, notwithstanding the absence of such evidence, we should not run any risk in this matter, however small.In this connection, it was necessary to look at the legal position.The Defence Regulation in question, 18 B, had originally been drawn in very wide terms empowering the Home Secretary to make a detention order &quot; if satisfied with respect to any particular person,that with a view to preventing him acting in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or the Defence of the Realm, it is necessary soto do.&quot; As so drawn, it was tantamount to an open warrant whichcould be used against any person. The Regulation had arousedgreat opposition in the House of Commons, and it had been modified to read as follows : - -&quot; If the Secretary of State has reasonable cause to believeany person to be of hostile origin or associations or to have been recently concerned in acts prejudicial to the public safety orthe Defence of the Realm or in the preparation or instigationof such acts and that by reason thereof it is necessary to exercise control over him ... .&quot;It would be seen that the modified wording put a definiteresponsibility upon the Home Secretary to decide whether there was reasonable cause to believe that the person concerned had, as aquestion of fact, been recently concerned in prejudicial acts.The Home Secretary thought that the War Cabinet should givea decision on the following two questions : (i) They should decide whether they felt that, in order to eliminate any possible risk, the controlling persons in the fascist Organisation should now be taken into custody.

Cabinet a Minute from Major-General Ismay to the Prime Minister,(Previous a copy of which is annexed to these Minutes.   The Lord PresidentReference: said that this Minute emphasised the imperative need for theW.M.

This viewmet with general approval.The Home Secretary added that persons detained had the rightto appeal to an independent body. He thought that it would be undesirable to disturb that right of appeal, which, however, left itfree to the Home Secretary to take such action as he thought right in any particular case notwithstanding the recommendations of theindependent body.The War Cabinet: (1) Agreed that Defence Regulation 18 B should be amended onthe lines suggested at &quot; A &quot; by the Home Secretary, whowas invited to submit an amended Regulation for theapproval of His Majesty in Council.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary, as soon as this Regulationhad been made, to take such action as he thought fit inregard to members of the Fascist Organisation, acting on the general principle that the action taken should besufficient to cripple the Organisation.
ANNEX.Prime Minister,It has hitherto been thought that a seaborne invasion of this country was an enterprise which the Germans could not hope to launch with any prospect ofsuccess for some considerable time. Moreover, it has been assumed that the sequence of events would be first a sustained attack to destroy our air force,then an airborne invasion to seize a port, after which the seaborne invasionwould take place. Hence, our Home Defence preparations at the present time are mainly directed towards dealing with the problem of parachute troops andwith the protection of the ports from the landward side. I think the events of the last few days and the grim possibilities of the next must cause us to modifyour views.In view of past experience in Norway, Holland and France, it can be taken for granted that the Germans have the &quot;plan for the invasion of this countryworked out to the last detail, and have provided all necessary special equipment,such as motor landing craft, &amp;c. The flat-bottomed boats so frequently reported by the Secret Service as being prepared in German ports have not yet been used,nor have the Germans yet exploited the possibilities of gas. We can be sure that Hitler would be prepared to sacrifice 90 per cent, of the whole expedition ifhe could gain a firm bridgehead on British soil with the remaining 10 per cent.The German numerical superiority in the air is still very formidable. by using a mass of bombers escorted by strong forces of fighters, the Germans mightcalculate on maintaining a local air superiority sufficient for the launching ofa seaborne expedition very early in their campaign against us. Besides landing-troops from the air to seize a port, they might make their landing on the openbeach with forces, which included tanks and artillery.Recent events have shown the terrible results which can&apos; be achieved byarmoured forces operating through a country which has not been preparedto oppose them. The counter to such forces is a scheme of well-planned demolitionscovered by resolute troops. Since time is required for reconnaissance and preperation of demolitions on a large scale, not a moment should be lost insetting to work. The demolitions themselves should be prepared and strong points and other obstacles constructed.No real progress can be made unless the powers over persons and property,which it is intended that the Government should assume in a grave emergency,are taken at once. Otherwise, the military authorities will be hampered in thepreparation of defences, the making of obstacles, &amp;c. by having to go throughthe normal procedure of acquisition and compensation. There will also be ashortage of labour to assist the armed forces.I feel very strongly that the grave emergency is already upon us.I suggest (a) That a directive to cover the plans and preparations which must nowbe made should be issued under your authority without delay.(6) That full powers should be given forthwith to the military authorities toenable them to carry out defensive measures of all kinds without reference to any other authority and without hampering forms ofprocedure, and to provide them with the necessary labour to supple-ment the troops.(Signed) H. L. ISMAY.May 21, 1940.
