The western front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 141stConclusions,Minute 1.)Capitulation ofthe Belgian Army.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that a message had been received from Sir Roger Keyes to the effect that the king of the Belgians had ordered his Commander-in-Chief to send aplenipotentiary to the Germans to ask for an armistice for theBelgian Army to take effect from midnight that night.News of this had been received in Paris and General Spearshad rung up* to say that General Weygand had advised the FrenchGovernment to dissociate themselves from the Belgians in thismatter and to order General Blanchard and Lord Gort to fight on.He had asked for the Prime Ministers support in this advice.The Prime Minister said that he had acceded immediately tothis request.The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that a telegram had been despatched from the War Office informing Lord Gort thatthe French Government had been told that he would, of course,dissociate himself from this movement on the part of the King ofthe Belgians.The War Cabinet was informed that the Belgian Governmentin this country was also dissociating itself from the action of theKing.   This would be announced by the B.B.C. that night.The Prime Minister said that he had telegraphed to Sir RogerKeyes in the early hours of that morning that the british expeditionary Force was withdrawing towards the ports, and thatwe should do our best to evacuate such of the Belgian Army as could get back to the coast. He had emphasised the importance of ensuring the King&apos;s safety, and had made it clear that we shouldfight on to the end. This message should not have affected theKing&apos;s determination to continue the struggle, although, perhaps,he could not altogether be blamed now for the action he was taking.Nevertheless, he had been very precipitate in seeking an armistice.Apparently the collapse of the Belgians was due to the heavybombing to which they had been subjected that day. Any grounds for recrimination lay rather in the Belgian action on the outbreakof war than in the more immediate past. At the time when therehad been only fifteen German divisions on their Western frontier,and the bulk of the German Army had been engaged in Poland, ifBelgium had then invited us to enter their country, we could have established ourselves in a strong defensive position or invadedGermany. The King&apos;s action was certainly not heroic. Presumably,he would now make a separate peace with the Germans and carryon as a puppet monarch. This might well be the best that he could do for his country, but we had to face the fact that it had the mostserious consequences for the British Expeditionary Force. It waspossible, of course, that the four divisions in the Lille area mightmanage to draw back and cut their way out to the coast. Ourformations were practically intact and the troops were in excellentheart. They did not realise the plight in which they had beenplaced.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the collapse of the Belgians would undoubtedly place the British ExpeditionaryForce in the most serious peril. Lord Gort had no troops withwhich to close the gap and prevent the Germans breaking through to Dunkirk. No information had yet been received by the WarOffice as to the casualties which our Army had suffered. Somepersonnel had been withdrawn from France that day, but a shipleaving Dunkirk that afternoon had been heavily attacked from theair and had suffered some casualties from machine-gun fire.The Prime Minister said that General Spears had reportedthat the feeling in Paris was better than it had been a short time a record of this conversation is attached to these Conclusions.
ago. This might perhaps be attributed in part to the results ofM. Reynaud&apos;s visit to London the previous day. As for the effectof the Belgian defection on French resistance, the French had probably already written off Blanchard&apos;s army as a dead loss. Theaction of the Belgians might sting the French to anger, in which case they would be very much more formidable opponents to theGermans than in their present stunned and bewildered state.Our chief preoccupation now was to get off as much of theBritish Expeditionary Force as possible. There would be veryconfused fighting in the area of operations. The bombers on bothsides would be able to do little, as the opposing troops would bevery much intermingled. The German bombers, however, would get their opportunity when our men reached the coast.The Chief of the Air Staff said that large numbers of fighters had been operating that day over the French coast. We had lost9 aircraft, but 23 Germans had been shot down for certain and several more unconfirmed. The German Air Force had been very active indeed during the day. The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, was proposing to use formations of3 squadrons the following day in order to compete with the largefighter escorts of the enemy.The battle for The Secretary of State for War said that it was now clear thatCalais. Calais had fallen.   On the night of 25th-26th destroyers, whichhad been handled with the greatest gallantry, had taken off wounded and a small number of troops from the quay. Most of our troops,however, had been cut off from the quay, holding positions in thecitadel and in the streets. During the day 20 Lysander aircraft,by a most skilful operation, had dropped food, water and ammu-nition for the troops. That morning, however, reconnaissance aircraft had reported that all fighting in the town had ceased.The Minister of Information suggested that a statement shouldbe issued referring to the gallant defence by the British troops.The Prime Minister agreed, but thought that for the sake ofrelatives no names of regiments should be given at present.Information for The Minister of Information suggested that the public shouldthe public.        be given some indication of the serious position in which the B.E.F.had been placed. The French communiques still had a cheerfultone. There was no doubt that the public were, at the moment,quite unprepared for the shock of realisation of the true position.The Prime Minister thought that the seriousness of thesituation should be emphasised; but he would deprecate any detailed statement or attempt to assess the results of the battle,until the situation had been further cleared up. The announcementof the Belgian Armistice would go a long way to prepare the public for bad news.AThe Minister of Information said that he realised the dangerof announcements which appeared to contradict the Frenchcommuniques, and he thought that it would be as well to remind the public of the constant German efforts to drive a wedge betweenthe two peoples. At the same time editors could be asked to toneI down the French announcements.The Prime Minister thought that it would be necessary for himto make a full statement in Parliament, although it might be anotherweek before the situation had cleared sufficiently to allow him to doso. He proposed to say that the essential dangers which hadmenaced this country in the first days of the war had not been greatly increased by&apos;what had happened. Our means of meetingthem, &quot;on the other hand, had increased since the beginning of thewar; moreover, we could take heart from the superior quality and morale of our Air Force which had been so clearly demonstrated.
Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,May 28, 1940.Danger of The Permanent Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairsrecriminations, said that he had had a conversation with the French ambassador on the subject of recriminations. The French Ambassador had referred to the rumours which he had heard to the effect that theFrench by not counter-attacking had jeopardised the B.E.F. after all, the French were vitally interested in the Northern area, in whichthey had several &quot;Divisions. He (Sir Alexander Cadogan) had replied that no such rumours had come to his ears, but that they appeared to be as foolish as the rumours which he had heard thatthe intended drive to the South had not been carried out, owing tothe failure of the B.E.F. to attack. M. Corbin had agreed that everything possible should be done to avoid recriminations.The War Cabinet :-Took note of the above discussion and invited the Ministerof information to deal with the Press on the lines indicated at &quot; A &quot; above.
Record   of  a   Telephone   Conversation   between   the   Prime   Minister   and major-General Spears, at 8-20 p.m. on Monday, May 27, 1940.Major-General Spears said that the French High Command had receiveda message from General Champon (French Mission to the Belgian Army) tothe effect that the King of the Belgians had telegraphed to his Chief of staff to send a plenipotentiary to the Germans to ascertain under what conditions an armistice could be arranged, and had suggested &apos;&apos; cease fire &apos;&apos; at midnightto-night, the 27th-28th May. General Champon had said that he had taken note of this communication, and had added that these conditions could not besettled without getting into touch with Paris. Inasmuch as the three Armies,the Belgian, French and British, formed one block, the Belgians could not act alone. General Champon concluded by saying that he was making contact with General Blanchard, and would be grateful for the instructions ofGeneral Weygand.To this communication General Weygand had replied as follows:  (1) I will advise my Government immediately.(2) Whilst awaiting new instructions, I am ordering General Blanchard todissociate himself from the Belgian surrender.(3) General Blanchard will take all urgent decisions in agreement withGeneral Lord Gort to counter this act of desertion.General Spears then said that General Weygand desired the immediateagreement of the Prime Minister to the despatch of the following telegram toGeneral Blanchard : &quot; The French and British Governments have agreed to instruct theirCommanders-in-Chief, Generals Blanchard and Lord Gort, to defend the honour of their flags by dissociating themselves totally from the Belgianarmistice.&quot;The Prime Minister replied to General Spears that he was in full agreementwith the above telegram, and that instructions were being given to Lord Gort tocontinue his operation in conjunction with General Blanchard.In conclusion, General Spears said that the Belgian Government weredissociating themselves from the act of the King of the Belgians, and thatM. Pierlot was going to announce this fact on the wireless to-night.
