1. The Prime Minister said that the situation which had developed round the Channel Ports had become so critical that hehad instructed the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to remain at the War Office in order that he might in person supervise theconduct of these operations. It appeared that very much largerGerman forces had succeeded in getting through the gap than had at first been supposed. General Reichenau&apos;s statement purporting to warn the German Armies against a determined stand by theAllied Armies in the North was clearly intended to deceive; andwas an indication of how imperative it was that the British and belgian Armies should extricate themselves from their present trap.The Prime Minister said that he had received a telegram fromthe British Ambassador in Paris stating that General Weygandand M. Reynaud had confirmed their agreement with the plan of operations in the North which had been agreed upon the previous day. General Weygand had said that the conditions for this were more favourable at the present than on the previous day, but had emphasised the vital necessity for holding Boulogne and especiallyCalais.The whole success of the plan agreed with the French depended on the French forces taking the offensive. At present they showedno signs of doing so.He had accordingly sent the following telegram toM. Reynaud : &quot; Strong enemy armoured forces have cut communicationsof northern armies. Salvation of these armies can only beobtained by immediate execution of Weygand&apos;s plan. I demand that French Commanders in North and South and BelgianGeneral Headquarters be given most stringent orders to carrythis out and turn defeat into victory. Time vital as supplies are short.A copy of this telegram had been sent to Lord Gort.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that he had been in touchwith Sir Roger Keyes on the telephone.   Sir Roger said that the belgians would co-operate in the plan agreed upon with the Frenchthe previous day.If General Weygand&apos;s plan succeeded, it would mean therelease of 35 Allied Divisions from their present serious predica-ment. If it failed, it would be necessary to make a fresh plan withthe object of saving and bringing back to this country as manyof our best troops and weapons with as little loss as possible. these would prove a valuable addition to the defence of these islandsagainst the attack on them which was likely to be the next phase of the war.The plans to guard against the latter contingency were to be reviewed at a meeting of Ministers and Chiefs of Staff to be held that afternoon.The Secretary of State for War gave the War cabinet particulars of a message which he had just received from BrigadierGriffin, commanding the Brigade at Boulogne.. Boulogne had been heavily attacked that morning by German Forces comprising tanks and 5 - 9-inch Batteries. As a result our forces in Boulogne were in danger of being surrounded and cut off. Brigadier Griffin had left Colonel Fox Pitt at Boulogne in command of the two battalions of Guards. The inner defences of Boulogne were very strong andit was thought that these Battalions would be able to hold the placeuntil that night.Brigadier Griffin had then gone by the main road to Calais.On the way he had passed by 4 German medium tanks engaged inattacking a French Coastal Battery between Boulogne andWimereux. Wimereux Station was being shelled and there were a few German tanks in the vicinity.[21325] b 2The western front.Pi-ogress of operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 134thConclusions,Minute 1.)
On arrival at Calais he had found the place a seething mass of French troops and refugees, all of whom seemed completelydemoralised.He had found two Rifle battalions without, however, their transport holding a position outside Calais at Sangatte. brigade headquarters was in Calais. A British Armoured Regiment wasbeing disembarked in Calais, and if this could be got out of thetown it was thought that the situation might be saved.Brigadier Griffin had emphasised the imperative need for providing air protection over Calais in order to cover the disem-barkation and subsequent deployment of this Armoured Regiment.In Boulogne our forces comprised two Battalions of Guardsand one Anti-Aircraft Battery: in Dunkerque four Battalions ofFrench and one Anti-Tank Battery; in Calais one Battalion ofTerritorials, one Rifle Battalion and the Armoured Regiment whichwas in process of disembarking. A Brigade of Canadians was being organised to go to Calais on the following day. This would includethree Infantry Battalions, two Batteries of Artillery, and royal engineers, under the command of General McNaughten. Its rolewould be to open communications between St. Omer and Hazebrouck.On the previous evening seven divisions of the british expeditionary Force had been in the line and had been due to retire from the line of the Scheldt to the Belgian frontier. Three of the divisions in the line were to be relieved and sent to the area aroundNeuve Chapelle. Two other divisions forming the General Head-quarters reserves had attacked from Arras along the Scarpe towardsthe east. The attack had met with more resistance than had been expected, but had been successful; and had eased the situation inthat area. About 300 Germans had been killed, and 400 taken prisoner; and a number of tanks had been destroyed.The main difficulty had been to induce the French First army to attack. It had advanced on a two division front against Cambrai,but Lord Gort had little confidence that it would remain there. its strength was believed to be about six Divisions. General Blanchardhad stated that it was very tired, but he himself was in better heartthan he had been two days before.Twenty-two tons of rations had been flown to the british expeditionary Force on the previous day and another 18 that morning, but it was not certain whether the aerodrome used for thispurpose was still available. Food ships had been sent to Calais,Dunkerque and Boulogne respectively. The ship at Boulogne had had to leave before it had finished unloading; and difficulty wasbeing experienced in moving the food in lorries from the quay-sidesat Calais and Dunkerque.  The supply position was very anxious.In the South the Armoured Division was being landed atCherbourg. Round Rouen there was a British Force totalling about 15,000, including 5 battalions of artillery, under the command of General Vickery. General Karslake had been sent to takecommand of these forces.Information had been received that the 3rd British Corps hadbeen &quot;heavily hammered &quot; at Courtrai.The Lord Privy Seal asked if we were not in danger of fallingbetween two stools and that neither the plan agreed with general weygand would be effectively carried out, nor would we use our forces to the best advantage in retaining our hold on the channel ports.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that thebest hope still lay in carrying out the plan agreed with general weygand.Air operations. The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Air Force had beenasked to intervene with bombing operations in the Boulogne, Calais,St. Omer and Hazebrouck, and other areas. It was impossible toundertake this task as such requests virtually amounted to expecting
The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 132ndConclusions,Minute 2.)U-boatactivity.2. The First Sea Lord said that there had been a certainamount of U-boat activity in the approaches to the coast. TheDunster Grange (9,494 tons), bound for Liverpool from the Plate,had been shelled by a U-boat about 120 miles West-South-west of Land&apos;s End at 11 p.m. on the previous day. A SunderlandFlying Boat had been sent to her assistance, and H.M.S. Rochester,which was on escort duty in the vicinity, had been ordered to attack the U-boat.   The Dunster Grange was not in convoy.H.M.S. Deptford, while on escort duty, had carried out anattack off Ushant on a U-boat at 10-30 a.m. on the previous day.A large quantity of oil had been observed and, after three further attacks, large air bubbles had been observed. H.M.S. Deptford wasremaining in the vicinity.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.United States 3.   The Prime Minister read to his colleagues a telegramof America. (unnumbered, dated the 23rd May 1940), which he had received fromSuggested the Prime Minister of the Australian Commonwealth, suggestingappeal by the that in view of the gravity of the situation, the Dominion Govern-Dominion ments should severally address appeals to President Roosevelt forGovernments the release of every available aircraft, and that they should alsoto President appeal for American volunteer pilots. Mr. Menzies had asked theRoosevelt other Dominion Prime Ministers to give their views on this for aircraft suggestion, and the Prime Minister of New Zealand had already sent a telegram (No. 189, Most Secret, dated the 23rd May, 1940)to say that his Government would only support: the proposedapproach if (a) the military situation required it, and (b) informalenquiries at Washington had made it clear that it would not be unwelcome to the Administration and would, in their opinion, belikely to lead to useful results. Telegram No. 441, dated the 23rdMay, had just been received from General Smuts expressing theopinion that it was for the Government in the United Kingdom toadvise, in the light of their knowledge of the. military situation,whether the suggested representations should be made.bombers to intervene in street fighting. Instructions had been issued,however, to support the operations in the Arras district, and pilotshad received orders to fly low and to recognise their targets beforeactually bombing.The blocking of The Secretary of State for War raised the question of theZeebrugge. blocking of Zeebrugge, which he understood could be done whilst(Previous still leaving the outer harbour free.wM^am-m d ^rst ^ea Lord said that this was so but that in any casew.M. (40) lddrd ^e operation could not take place till the following night.Conclusions, L 1 o     oMinute 1.) The War Cabinet decided that action should not be taken to information for  block Zeebrugge, until Lord Gort&apos;s wishes had been ascertained.the Press. The Minister of Information raised the question of what information should be given to the Press in regard to the presentposition.The Prime Minister said that he would be making a statement on the situation in the House that afternoon and the Minister ofInformation might use this to guide him as to what he should say to the Press.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
The Prime Minister read out a reply which he had in mind to send to Mr. Menzies (with copies to the other Dominion PrimeMinisters), giving an appreciation of the situation, describing the messages which had already been sent to President Roosevelt, andexpressing the opinion that we had not yet reached a situation inwhich a public appeal would be justified.*The War Cabinet expressed general agreement with thelines on which the Prime Minister proposed to reply tothe Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia.4. The Chief of the Naval Staff informed the War Cabinetthat the Italian Aircraft Carrier Maraglia was due to arrive at port Said on the following day. Enquiries had shown that theship&apos;s movements had followed a programme which had beenprepared some considerable time before, and which was unlikely to have been drawn up so long in advance for the express purposeof having the ship in position to block the Canal on the 25th May.He therefore thought it unlikely that the Italians had any sinistermotive in wishing the ship to enter the Canal.The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs referred to telegramNo. 622 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, reporting that theship was the only carrier in the Italian Navy and had 30 aircraft on board. She was therefore unlikely to be sacrificed as a blockship.Our Ambassador deprecated any approach to the Italian Govern-ment unless we had very strong grounds for such a step.The Foreign Secretary suggested that, if the thirty aircraft were still on board the ship when she arrived at Port Said, she should be allowed to pass through the Canal. If, however, theaircraft had been taken off at Benghazi, steps should be taken to delay her passage for three days, and we should then considerwhether we should put a direct question to the Italian Government,revealing our suspicions.The War Cabinet: (a) Agreed to adopt the course proposed by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.(b) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to make arrange-ments for delaying the passage of the Maraglia throughthe Suez Canal for three days, if she should put off heraircraft before arriving at Port Said.5. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegramNo. 415, dated 22nd May, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Rome, reporting that Signor Mussolini was only awaiting theestablishment of the Germans in the Channel Ports to declare war.In regard to the suggestion in that telegram that submarineswould be used to transport troops and equipment for the invasion of this country, the Chief of Naval Sto,ff pointed out that theGermans did not possess anything like the number of submarinesmentioned, nor could each submarine carry anything approaching the large number of armed men suggested..  ,  The War Cabinet took note of these statements.* It was made clear later that Mr. Menzies had not contemplated -publicappeals to the President ; the Prime Minister accordingly modified his reply toMr. Menzies to indicate that he would welcome private appeals to the Presidentfrom the Dominion Prime Ministers.Italy.Possible plan for blockingthe Suez Canal.(previous reference:W.M.

Egypt.Request forair reinforce-ments.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 107thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 360 DIPP, dated 22nd May, 1940, from Sir miles lampson in Cairo stressing the serious inadequacy of the british air armament in Egypt, and the great advantages that would result if some modern fighter aircraft could be sent there. He assumed that nothing could be done at the moment to meet this request.The Chief of the Air Staff confirmed that this was the case.The War Cabinet took note of this information.Greece.The questionof an alliance.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 164) on thequestion of an alliance with Greece.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the GreekGovernment had raised from time to time the question whether weshould be willing to substitute an alliance for our present unilateralguarantee to Greece. He did not wish to go into details at thepresent time, but suggested that there might very well be advantages in being able to count definitely on having Greece on our side,provided the terms of any alliance were so drawn as to leave it tous to decide if and when Greece should enter the War (para-graph (/) of W.P. (40) 164). He suggested that the Chiefs of Staffmight consider the matter, and give their views on this point.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff hadalready considered the point, and were definitely not in favour ofan alliance, which would, in their opinion, result in our undertaking a further commitment, which we should be unable to meet.The Prime Minister suggested that it was hardly profitable todiscuss the matter further at the present time, in view of the extremeuncertainty of the military situation.The War Cabinet accordingly postponed discussion of theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(W.P. (40) 164).Spain.Sir samuel hoare&apos;mission.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 133rdConclusions,Minute 6.)8.

India.Constitutionalproblems.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 89thConclusions,Minute 10.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India regarding the reply to be givento two Questions in the House of Commons that afternoon(W.P. (G.) (40) 133).The Secretary of State for India said that the revised draftAnswer which had been prepared since the circulation of his memorandum represented the result of telegraphic correspondence between himself and the Viceroy; apart from minor changes, he now proposed to leave out references to the recent speech by PanditJawaharlal Nehru and to reverse the order of the last two sentences.In a private letter he had received from the Viceroy that morning, the Viceroy had said that with Mr. Gandhi in his presentintransigent mood and pressing for &quot; self-determination,&quot; he (theViceroy) was anxious not to be manoeuvred into a position in whichhe had to take the initiative of sending for Messrs. Jinnah andGandhi. Lord Linlithgow thought that there would be advantage in re-stating the position which had been made clear in statements in both Houses of Parliament on the 18th April last, viz. that while we were ready and anxious to promote a settlement, the first essentialwas for the Indian parties themselves to co-operate in an attempt to solve the constitutional problem. Accordingly, the Answer whichhe proposed to give in the House of Commons that afternoon repre-sented no change in policy, but was a sympathetically wordedre-statement of the policy which had been announced the previous month, pending a review of the situation on which he (the Secretaryof State) was at present engaged.The Lord Chancellor expressed his agreement with the general line of the draft reply, which appeared to him to be in warm terms,and which would, he thought, be recognised in India as such. Therewere one or two drafting suggestions which he had made to theSecretary of State for India, the most important of which was designed to make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome an interim settlement without prejudice to a final agree-ment on the major issue.The War Cabinet agreed To approve the revised draft Answer circulated by theSecretary of State for India, subject to consideration ofcertain drafting amendments suggested by the LordChancellor.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,May 23, 1940.
