The air situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 175thConclusions,Minute 1.)bomber command.coastal command.Mediterranean.BalloonCommand.1. The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff said that there had been little enemy activity over the United Kingdom on the 22nd June.Three raids had been reported off Kinnaird&apos;s Head. A Heinkel 111had been engaged by fighters, but the interception was inconclusive.Another raid of 3 aircraft had come over Kent later in the day.The interception which was made was again inconclusive.Offensive fighter patrols had been carried out over north-eastFrance, in which we had lost one Hurricane. The enemy&apos;scasualties had been one confirmed and six unconfirmed.Reports had been received of the operations carried out on the night the 21st-22nd June on oil plants and aircraft factories.These attacks appeared to have been very successful, as also hadthose which had been made on marshalling yards and trains. direct hits had been obtained on two hangars at the air stores depot atRotenburg, causing large explosions. Fires had also been started on the Fuhlsbuttel aerodrome at Hamburg.A daylight raid had been made on the 22nd June on theMerville aerodrome by 18 Blenheims escorted by fighters. bombing operations on the night the 22nd-23rd June had been abandonedowing to unfavourable weather.A reconnaissance of the Narvik area had reported no naval vessels seen except a few minesweepers. A Hudson on recon-naissance between christians and and Haugesund on the morning of the 22nd June sighted a large German merchant vessel steeringsouth with a big deck cargo of crates. The aircraft had attacked and scored a direct hit, which caused a fierce fire. The Hudsonhad returned later, after being chased off by German fighters, andhad seen the ship with her stern awash and apparently sinkingrapidly.An attempted reconnaissance of Trondhjem had been unsuccessful owing to bad weather. A reconnaissance of the danish and German coasts had found no German warships at all.Five German motor torpedo boats had been found steering south-west off Terschelling by a patrolling Hudson, which had attacked with bombs, but claimed no hits.There had been less activity in the Mediterranean area, but one Italian aircraft had been shot down in flames over Malta by aGladiator.One enemy aircraft had been brought down by the balloonbarrage over Billingham on the night of the 19th-20th June, andanother at Southampton on the night the 21st-22nd June.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.Evacuation offoreign troops.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 175thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatsome 10,000 Poles and Czechs were believed to be making their wayto the coast for evacuation. Some 8,000 French troops, includingAir Force personnel and technicians, were moving down towardsthe Gironde.  The Czech Division, some 10,000 strong, was at Sete.The First Sea Lord said that H.M.S. Keppel had been sent tothe Marseilles area and would organise the evacuation of these troops from the South coast. It was hoped to use French ships fortheir transport.The Prime Minister emphasised the importance of organisingFrench formations to join the other foreign troops in an Army of liberation. The War Office should also press forward with theformation of a Foreign Legion.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that action was already being taken in this matter.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.[21439]b 2
The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 175thConclusions,Minute 3.)Enemy attacks on shipping.3. The First Sea Lord said that there had been no losses from enemy action on the 22nd June, but it was now known that on the21st June the British tanker San Fernando (13,500 tons) had been torpedoed south-west of Cape Clear. She was still afloat. a norwegian tanker, Eli Knudsen, had been found abandoned but still afloat to the west of Land&apos;s End. It would not be possible toincrease convoy escorts until the evacuation from France had beencompleted owing to the large demands this made upon small craft.The Prime Minister emphasised the importance of givingadequate protection to transports carrying personnel evacuated from France, on their way to this country.Mutiny of The First Sea Lord reported that the Duchess of York, which enemy aliens was taking some 6,000 German prisoners and internees to Canada,en route to had signalled that she had had one man killed and two woundedCanada. and feared a further rising.Attack on An Italian submarine had been sunk in the Red Sea off Perim.Italian We knew now for certain that 3 out of the 8 Italian submarinessubmarines.       operating east of Suez had been put out of action.   One of these had been captured.scharnhorst. The tracks of all ships engaged in the recent operationsdirected against the Scharnhorst had now been plotted, with one exception, information of which was not yet complete. As soonas this was obtained a full enquiry into the operations would becarried out. It seemed probable that the Scharnhorst had slippedinto Stavanger. Owing to weather conditions no air reconnaissance of the Stavanger area had been possible, but wireless activity gave evidence that she might have moved out during the night.Submarine patrols were watching the area. The Polish submarineWilk, which had been on this duty, had suffered damage from a&quot; mine and was returning to Rosyth.Operations Military objectives at Bardia had been bombarded on thein the morning of the 21st June and good results obtained.   A sweep hadMediterranean,   been carried out along the coast as far as Mersa Tobruk at the sametime, but no enemy ships had been encountered.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The French 4.   The First Sea Lord gave the particulars of our FleetFleet. dispositions in relation to the units of the French Fleet.(&quot;Previous The. Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, had been instructedReference- ^0 discuss tne situation very frankly with the French AdmiralWM (40&quot;) 176th a&apos; Alexandria. If it seemed that he could be relied upon, theConclusions operations by the Anglo-French Fleet which had previously been minute 5) &apos; postponed would be carried through. French ships had operatedwithout trouble under British orders in operations against theItalians off the Libyan coast on the 21st June.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that thiswas a very healthy sign, since these operations had been carriedout after the French Government had approached the Italians foran armistice.Suggested visit of the Secretaryof State for theColonies and the vice--Chief ofthe Naval staff to Oran.The Prime Minister explained the circumstances in which hehad decided early that morning, in consultation with the foreign secretary, that it would be wiser to defer the visit of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies and the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff toOran pending information&apos; as to how the situation was developing.The Foreign Secretary said that he had contemplated that theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Vice-Chief of naval staff would hearten and encourage the French authorities in north africa which might be in a twilight of uncertainty.
Reference was made to telegram No. 32, Circular, which hadbeen despatched early that morning to His Majesty&apos;s Represen-tatives in all French colonies appealing to them to stand by with us and giving undertakings in regard to financial and economichelp.In discussion it was also suggested that steps should be takento emphasise the inference of the sea power which we were stillable to exert in the Mediterranean.On the other hand, it was felt that it would be very unfortunate if the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Vice-Chief ofNaval Staff were to arrive at Oran and find that the authoritiesin Algeria and Tunis were not prepared to continue resistance.It was also suggested that it would be better to defer the projected mission until steps had been taken to form a Council of liberation from among French personalities who had come to thiscountry (see Minute 8).Reference was also made to the difficulty of sparing theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Vice-Chief of naval staff from their duties at the present time.The War Cabinet-Decided that the proposed visit of the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies and the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff to Oranshould be deferred for the present at any rate.FrenchShipping.(PreviousReference5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad not yet been able to set side by side the German terms for an armistice and the French counter-proposals, but one point arosewith regard to Article 11 relating to merchant shipping.   This^nri.  Article  was  summarised  in  Sir  Ronald   CampbelTs  telegramW-M. (40) 175th No Dipp  part 2 ag followg . Conclusions,Minute 5.) &quot; 11. No French merchant shipping to leave harbour.Merchant ships outside France to be recalled, or if not possibleto go to neutral ports.&quot;In these circumstances it was clearly right that we should proceed on the general principle of holding all French, shipping,wherever there was a risk that it might comply with the Armistice&quot; A &quot; I terms. In explanation of any steps taken to hold French shipping,it should be pointed out that French troops were still fighting, andthat we were holding shipping in the name of the &quot; Council of liberation&quot; (see Minute 8).The War Cabinet invited the First Lord of the admiralty to proceed as at &quot;A.&quot;France. 6.   The War Cabinet were informed that the French aircraft-The Emile carrier Beam which was bringing 50 aircraft from the UnitedBertin and the States and the Emile Bertin carrying  60 millions of gold hadSeam &apos; DOth been ordered to proceed to Martinique.(Previous The First Sea Lord said that HALS. Dunedin had been orderedReference:        t0 proceed to Martinique to meet these two French ships.  DunedinW.M. (40) 175th could get there quicker than any other ship in the area, but theConclusions,      French ships would probably arrive there before her.Minute 5.) .The Prime Minister emphasised the importance of gettingpossession of these two ships, and in particular the gold. We couldannounce that we should keep the gold in trust for the French Empire, but that they must fight for it. Dunedin should proceed at full speed, and her captain should make contact with the governor of Martinique and try to get him on our side.   She should not
let the two French ships out of her sight. If they stayed inMartinique well and good, but if they moved she should shadowthem so that they could be intercepted. They might slip acrossto Dakar, which was the nearest point on the other side of the atlantic.The First Sea Lord said that Dunedin was not quite so powerfula ship as Emile Bertin, but it should be able to deal with her. Ifthe two French ships slipped across the Atlantic either Hermes orDorsetshire would be in the Dakar area to intercept them.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought there wouldbe no difficulty at all in justifying our seizure of the gold. Wecould base our action on the evident desire of the French colonies to continue the struggle and the fact that Germany had demandedthe surrender of all the French gold. Care would have to be taken,however, not to alienate the sympathies of the sounder elementsamong the French by taking too drastic action against french ships which refused to comply with our demands. The time forsuch action might come later.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement and invited the First Lordof the Admiralty to prepare instructions for issue to the captain of H.M.S. Dunedin.France. 7.

United Kingdom in HALS. Galatea that day.The War Cabinet expressed their high appreciation of thegreat courage and resolution which Sir Ronald Campbellhad displayed in the most difficult and often distastefulcircumstances.France. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionFormation of a  to Telegram No. 507 DIPP, from Sir R. Campbell at Bordeaux,&quot; Council of      reporting  the  various  French  personalities  who  had  alreadyLiberation.&quot;      embarked.   These people would form a nucleus for a continuation of the struggle in the French Empire.   General de Gaulle mightwell be the centre around which some of the most resolute Frenchstatesmen might rally.Later in the Meeting the Prime Minister read a letter whichhe had just received from General de Gaulle outlining the proposalsfor setting up a Council of Liberation (Comite NationalFrancais). He asked the British Government to recognise thisCouncil. General de Gaulle was a fine fighting soldier, with a goodreputation and a strong personality, and might be the right manto set up such a Council. Before, however, approving the proposal and giving it official recognition, it would be as well to ascertain what French personalities were available to serve on the Counciland which of them, in particular, General de Gaulle had in mind.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldmake a declaration recognising a Council of Liberation.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toexamine the proposals in General de Gaulle&apos;s letter, andthe Memorandum enclosed therewith, as a matter ofgreat urgency. /
Seizure of 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatSwedish telegrams Nos. 760, 762 DIPP, 766 DIPP and 767 had beenDestroyers. received from Stockholm saying that the Swedish Government had(Previous taken the gravest possible view of our action in seizing the fourReference:        destroyers at the Faroe Islands.   Mr. Mallet had been informedW.M. (40) 174th that assurances had been given by the German Naval AuthoritiesConclusions,      that  the  destroyers would  not be  seized by  German  forces.Minute 4.)        Arrangements had been made for German escort through theSkaggerak minefields and written route instructions had beenreceived.   The Swedish Government thought that we might haveintercepted messages between Sweden and Germany about the route to be followed and have inferred that the Swedish Govern-ment was in collusion with Germany.   Sweden had acted vigorouslyto defend her neutrality and Swedish shipping had been ordered to resist any attempts at capture.   The result of our action would,however, be that Germany would suspect Swedish collusion with us and grave consequences might follow.Mr. Mallet had stressed the danger of a swift German counter-stroke in the form of an ultimatum to Sweden to accept German&quot;protection&quot; against Great Britain. He doubted whether, after our hostile act, the Swedish Government would resist this demand,which would place the whole Swedish navy in German hands, and allow Germany to exploit Swedish iron mines and industry to anunlimited extent. The destroyers had been accompanied by a shipfull of Swedish evacuees from the United Kingdom, which wouldmake the incident look even worse in the Swedish Press.A telegram No. 540 DIPP in reply had been sent to Mr. Malletas follows : Our reason for detaining the ships was that we believedthey would ultimately fall into German hands. The news thata safe-conduct had been arranged with the German Govern-ment was not in itself sufficient to make us alter our decision,but Mr. Mallet had been authorised to tell the Swedish Govern-ment that their protest was under consideration. Nothing was known of the assurance of a safe passage said to have beengiven by the British Admiralty to the Swedish Admiralty.The Foreign Secretary went on to say that we had been previously informed that the destroyers were bound for Petsamo,but it was now clear that they had been bound for Sweden andwould probably have arrived there safely. The consequences of holding these ships might be most serious; Germany would be certain to turn the incident to her fullest advantage, and mightwell present Sweden with an ultimatum, asking for the control ofher Navy and industry to be handed over. Even if this did not follow, we should forfeit any remaining Swedish goodwill and any chance that the Swedes might resist industrial demands made byGermany. The destroyers in question were reported to be smalland not very efficient, and it appeared very doubtful whether theadvantages obtained by seizing them outweighed the disadvantages.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the destroyers hadbeen seized in very suspicious circumstances. An attempt had beenmade at the Faroe Islands to carry out acts of sabotage on the shipsas soon as our intention to seize them had become known. If theships were really bound for Sweden via the Skaggerak, it was difficult to understand their presence so far north as the faroe islands. Their value as destroyers was not high, but they wouldbe suitable for convoy purposes, where their presence would makea considerable difference. We should, of course, offer to pay com-pensation and send on the shipload of evacuees. In addition tothese four ships, the Swedish Navy included 8 destroyers,8 submarines and some local defence ships, including large coastaldefence vessels, but it seemed doubtful whether Germany wouldtake the strong action against Sweden that had been indicated, in
view of probable Russian reactions. Moreover, it would be inter-preted as a sign of weakness if we were now to reverse our decision.The Prime Minister said that Germany would at any momentshe chose overrun Sweden, and he doubted whether this incidentwould affect German intentions towards Sweden. Nor would it belikely to affect the Swedish attitude to Germany. The Swedes setconsiderable store by their independence and, although angry with us for seizing 4 destroyers, would be still more angry with Germanyif she were to seize the remaining 8 and attempt to control thecountry. In any case, the 4 destroyers would be of more use to usthan the 8 would be to the Germans.The Lord President of the Council said that Sweden knew thatshe could not bully Germany, but might succeed in bullying us intohanding over these 4 ships. Their presence at the Faroe Islandswas most suspicious, and to release these destroyers would probablymean handing them over to German control. The reason whySwedes so strongly resented our action was that they feared itmight precipitate a German descent on themselves. We should adhere to our decision to keep the ships, but in replies to Swedishprotests should emphasise that our suspicions had been raised byfinding them so far north. He would like to know what alternativethe Foreign Secretary had in mind.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the only alternative was to hand back the ships. But this need not be done at once, and while the ships were still in our hands we could use them as an argument in negotiations on a question that theMinister of Aircraft Production had raised over orders foraeroplanes from America. He agreed that the Germans, in the irrelations with Sweden, would take the course that suited them best.Nevertheless, our action in holding these ships might undermine the Swedish will to resist German demands. German difficultiesin Sweden would depend on the degree of resistance encountered,and it would be undesirable to take any action that would makethings less difficult for them. It would also be a mistake to neglectthe general effect that our action would have on the judgment ofthe remaining neutral States. This aspect was somewhat intangible,but was nevertheless very important.The Prime Minister said that a decision on this question shouldbe taken on a broad basis. It might well be that all Europe,including Spain and Sweden, would fall under German control inthe near future. But it might well be to our advantage that theGermans should have to hold down all these intelligent and freedom-loving people; the task of this holding down all Europe should prove beyond even the strength of the Gestapo, provided Englandcould retain her liberty. If the Swedes resisted, so much the better,but it was very doubtful whether the present incident over the destroyers would materially affect either Swedish resistance orGerman intentions. The violent protest that the Swedes had mademight convince the Germans that our action had been taken withoutSwedish consent, and might not, therefore, in view of Russianinterest in Scandinavia, provoke Germany to action.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was more worried over the effect our action would have on neutral opinion in general than on the effect on Sweden. While he stilldoubted the wisdom of the course proposed, he was prepared to-adhere to the original decision.The War Cabinet agreed That the Swedish destroyers should be retained, but thatan immediate offer to pay compensation should be made.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 23, 1940.
