The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 159thConclusions,Minute 1.)H.M.S.Glorious.Operations onthe french coast.German attacks on trade.1. The Chief of the Naval Staff said that no further news hadbeen received about the German claim to have sunk H.M.S. Glorious.He feared, however, that the report was almost certainly true. TheGermans also claimed to have sunk one Destroyer and a &apos;&apos; modernTJ-Bcat Chaser.&quot; The reference to the latter was not understood.H.M.S. Glorious had been accompanied by two Destroyers, and itwas possible that one of these had escaped. The uncertainty onthis point was an argument in favour of awaiting confirmationbefore issuing any statement.In discussion it was pointed out that the Germans were broad-casting that they had sunk H.M.S. Glorious and that this claim was known throughout the Fleet. In these circumstances it was feltimpossible to delay further the issue of an announcement, whichshould be on the lines that, in the absence of any further reports,it must be presumed that H.M.S. Glorious had been sunk. Theannouncement would also refer to the sinking of S.S. Orama, anempty transport.The Chief of the Naval Staff reported the results of an air reconnaissance, and consideration was given to the question whethera certain operation should be carried out.The discussion and the Conclusion reached are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.A number of small craft had been sent to Le Havre the previous night, and would be sent there again that night. The French had asked for the moral support of Naval bombardment. destroyers were available which could give this support on receipt of informa-tion as to where it was required.An attack had been made by motor torpedo-boats on the north-bound convoy, but it was not believed that any ships had been hit.Two ships had been mined off the Thames approaches : theNorwegian S.S. Brandanger, which had been sunk, and the british.S. Empire Commerce, which bad been beached.The Polish Submarine Orzel was overdue, and it was feared that she was lost.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of these statements.(2) Agreed that an announcement should be issued forthwith in regard to the presumed loss of H.M.S. Glorious.The Air 2.

Three Blenheims had been lost by anti-aircraft fire.During the afternoon thirty Blenheims had carried out attacks onhorsed troop columns and armoured fighting vehicles and had secured many direct hits on long columns of enemy troops, without loss to themselves. During the night, 114 heavy bombers had attacked river crossings, road communications and other targetsindicated by the French. The forest areas between Hirson andFumay had been set on fire, and several explosions of ammunitiondumps had been observed. Other aircraft had attacked the[21398] b 2
northern entrances to Amiens and crossings of the Meuse, and, inspite of bad visibility, a good many hits had been registered.   Sixaircraft had carried out a reconnaissance over the minefield atFlensburg (Kattegat).Coastal The Coastal Command had carried out a special sweep to locateCommand.        enemy surface vessels.    They had also attacked M.T.B.&apos;s offRotterdam, but no results had been reported.Advanced Air The Advanced Air Striking Force, from whom few reports hadStriking Force, been received, had been carrying out attacks on bridges and communications behind the German lines. In all these operations the Advanced Air Striking Force had lost nine bombers and fivefighters and had brought down five enemy fighters for certain, withthe possibility of eight or ten others unconfirmed.During the day it was intended, subject to the weather beingsuitable, to carry out sweeps over the Le Treport area, and toprovide protection for troop transports proceeding to Le Havreand Cherbourg. The Advanced Air Striking Force would also provide anti-aircraft defences against air attacks on Havre.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Western 3.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that in theFront.

French Army was not yet back on the Paris Defence Line, and,although the position was undoubtedly serious, there was not muchenemy progress reported.   In the Seine area the situation wasdistinctly unsatisfactory.   Our own 51st Division, with two otherFrench Divisions, had been ordered to retire on Havre.   The twoFrench Divisions, which were equipped with horsed transport, were making slow progress.Around Rouen confused fighting was taking place and thelatest report was that there were some German A.F.V.&apos;s on thesouth bank of the Seine. The &apos;&apos; Beauman&apos;&apos; Force and the armoured Division had been withdrawn south of the Seine, all thebridges over which, except that at Rouen (which was uncertain),had been destroyed. Generally speaking, the French Army mightbe said still to be holding the German attacks. The real anxietylay in whether the French had adequate reserves to stem the german advance. On the other hand, the strain on the German communica-tions, which were now very long, must be very great indeed, andwas undoubtedly increased by our air operations.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Norway. 4.

hi \$ VGerman 5.   The Prime Minister said that the Germans and ItaliansPropaganda In were putting out propaganda with the object of convincing the france. French that now was the time for. them to make peace, as they hadbeen led astray by the British, who were not giving them anysupport. He thought that the best reply to this propaganda wouldbe a statement to be broadcast at 1 p.m. that day in the form of a message from the Prime Minister to M. Reynaud showing that all available means were being used to give help on land and sea andin the air.A draft of this statement, which had been prepared by theMinister of Information, was read to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Information to arrange forthis message to be broadcast at 1 p.m. that day.

(40) 158thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a report hadbeen received that an Italian ship had reached Port Said theprevious day with a cargo of munitions and cement. TheCommander-in-Chief had taken the view that this ship should not proceed through the Canal unless it was first unloaded. The ship,which was believed to be the Verbamia, was at present being held.The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that he had hada telegram from Sir Miles Lampson (No. 472 DIPP) urging thatthis ship should not be allowed to pass through the Canal.General agreement was expressed with the view that theVerbamia should be detained at Port Said on some pretext.The War Cabinet were informed that the,, S.S. Umbria had beenintercepted and taken into Port Sudan.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that seven Italian ships,including three tankers, had been detained at Gibraltar. Two ofthese had been released on the 8th June. He thought that, for thepresent, steps should be taken to detain all the remaining ships.This was agreed to.It was suggested that, in view of the openly hostile attitude adopted in Signor Ansaldo&apos;s broadcast, steps should be taken at allControl ports to bring in all Italian ships, and to detain them on some pretext connected with Contraband Control.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) That the Verbamia should not be allowed to proceedthrough the Suez Canal, but should be detained on somepretext at Port Said.(2) That Italian vessels at present detained at Gibraltar andother Control ports should not be released.(3) That, whenever possible, steps should be taken to bring allItalian ships into Control ports, and to detain them forthe time being on some pretext connected with Contra-band Control.Supreme WarCouncil.Suggestion foran early meeting.7. The Pfime Minister said that he had considered whether he ought to go to Paris at once to an early Meeting of the supreme war Council. No doubt a Meeting would be necessary in the nextfew days. But if he went to Paris now the French would almost certainly press us to give them help with lighter squadrons beyond what we could agree to. He therefore favoured entrusting GeneralSpears with a personal message to give to M. Reynaud.
In discussion the following points were made : Italy&apos;s (1) Signor Ansaldo&apos;s broadcast invited France to use Italy asattitude. a go-between in reaching a settlement which would free(Previous Germany&apos;s hands to attack us.  This should be answeredReference: as soon as possible.W.M. (40) 159th (2) We should do nothing which the French would interpretConclusions, as a deliberate provocation to Italy to enter the war.  in minute 6.) this connection the French had agreed to our taking action to intercept and detain Italian ships.(3) It would be helpful if M. Reynaud could be persuaded to answer Signor Ansaldo&apos;s broadcast by himself broad-casting words expressing the joint resolution of Franceand ourselves to maintain the struggle. This might be linked with a broadcast by the Prime Minister that evening.At the end of the discussion the Prime Minister said that hethought the best course would be for General Spears to proceed to paris that afternoon with a communication for M. Reynaud,explaining the action which we were taking and the forces whichwe hoped to develop, expressing the hope that M. Reynaud would himself answer Signor Ansaldo&apos;s broadcast as soon as possible, andsaying that he (the Prime Minister) would be prepared also to broadcast that evening.The Prime Minister added that he hoped that the foreign secretary would assist him in drafting the portion of the messagerelating to Signor Ansaldo&apos;s broadcast.The War Cabinet-Expressed general agreement with the procedure proposedby the Prime Minister.Germany. 8.

Minister, Belgrade, reporting having been informed by a source,which was normally exceptionally reliable, that the YugoslavMilitary Attache in Berlin had reported that the German Army had lost a very great number of tanks in the present battle in France, andwere unable to account for having suffered losses on so great a scale.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Spain.Attitude ofGeneral Franco.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 135thConclusions,Minute 8.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadno further news about the attitude of General Franco. As theCabinet would have seen from Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s telegramNo. 297 (R), dated the 8th June, 1940, General Franco had been most friendly when Sir Samuel Hoare had presented his credentials, andhad promised a longer talk in the near future. On former occasionsGeneral Franco had always insisted on speaking in Spanish, but onthis occasion he had spoken to Sir Samuel Hoare in French.Sir Samuel Hoare was in touch with other members of the SpanishGovernment and seemed hopeful of making some progress.

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (40) 198) submitting draft instructions for the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, british expeditionary Force.It was explained that these instructions to General Brooke(appointed in the first instance as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief) had been agreed by the Chiefs of Staff, and that since circula-tion some slight amendments in the drafting of paragraph 5 had alsobeen agreed.The War Cabinet approvedamended (see Annex II).the draft instructions as11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War giving proposals for the reorganisation of the 12 Divisions evacuated from Dunkirk (W.P. (40) 196).The Prime Minister drew attention to the advantages to beobtained from telescoping two divisions into one. It would beeconomical in Headquarters Staff and in ancillary troops, and wouldenable the maximum number of infantry units to be incorporatedwithin divisions. Some of the infantry units left over would beavailable to relieve the &quot; holding battalions &quot; from coast defenceduties, and to enable them to revert to their original role. He hopedthat it would be possible to increase the number of infantry battalions in each brigade from three to four, thereby increasing theproportion of fighting troops to administrative units.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that any changein the number of infantry in a division would affect the requirements in transport. The strength of the rifle battalions had recently been increased to 773, but it would be very difficult now to change from three to four battalions per infantry brigade.The Lord Privy Seal thought that in units that were fully equipped with automatic weapons the extra personnel might not benecessary, but that they would be very useful in battalions on homedefence duties who were not fully equipped in this respect.The War Cabinet approved the proposals contained in theMemorandum (W.P. (40) 196).Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,June 10, 1940.
ANNEX I.Message to M. Reynaud from the Prime Minister.THE maximum possible support is being given by British Forces in the greatbattle which the French Armies are now conducting Avith such undauntedcourage.All available means are being used to give help on land, sea, and in the air.The Royal Air Force has been continually engaged over the battlefield, and within the last few days fresh British forces have landed in France to take their place with those already engaged in the common struggle, whilst furtherextensive reinforcements are being rapidly organised, and will shortly beavailable.ANNEX II.Instructions to General Brooke (W.P. (40) 198).Re-draft of paragraph 5.5. The British Air Forces in France are operating under their own air officer Commanding-in-Chief, who acts in close co-operation with, but not underthe orders of, the French Commander-in-Chief.The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief has discretion to use his forces insupport of any major operation in which the Allied Armies may be involved.He has, however, been instructed that his primary role is the support of theBritish Expeditionary Force. With this in view he will detail a Senior liaison officer at your Headquarters, through whom you will submit your requirements for fighter and bomber support, and a General Staff Officer from your Head-quarters is attached to the Staff of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief.The appropriate quota of Army Co-operation Squadrons will be placed underyour direct operational control.You may rest assured that, when circumstances demand, you will have thefull support of the Royal Air Force as a whole.
