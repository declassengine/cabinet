(43) 518, 522 and 526.The War Cabinets discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.1. The Vice-Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events ofthe previous week.Air operations had been hampered by weather. bomber command had made a heavy double attack on Berlin and Mannheim.The former, though blind, was believed to have been effective.Leverkusen had also been attacked. 1,350 sorties had been made,and 40 aircraft lost.The United States Air Force had made three attacks, two ofthem on objectives in Norway.Coastal Command had made 687 sorties during the week andhad attacked 4 U-boats, of which 3 had probably been damaged.On the previous day 1 of their aircraft had watched a formationof He. 177 making a glider-bomb attack on a convoy, and hadengaged 3 of the aircraft.Fighter Command and Tactical Air Force had made 1,548sorties.Enemy activity had been on a small scale. Thirty-six aircraft had crossed the coast by night, of which 2 had been destroyed.Weather had hampered activity Thirty-seven Allied aircraft had been lost; 87 enemy aircraft had been destroyed, 43 of them onthe ground.   Sofia had been bombed by 91 Mitchells.Shipping losses by enemy action, including belated reports,were 3 ships, totalling 16,700 tons, making a total of 80,000 tons during the month. &quot; Nine U-boats had. probably been sunk during november, and no submarine attacks in the North Atlantic had beenreported during the week.A concentration of submarines in the path of a homeward-bound convoy from Gibraltar had been successfully engaged by the escort and by aircraft, and no attack had developed. Two ships had,however, been hit by glider bombs.The French battleship Richelieu had arrived at Scapa, and theItalian cruiser Due d&apos;Aosta had sailed from Freetown on an anti-blockade-runner patrol.Operations had been hampered by rain. The 8th Army had made slight progress, and enemy counter-attacks on the 5th Armyfront had met with little success. Some Italian troops were nowunder the command of General Clark.Leros had been forced to capitulate on the evening of Tuesday,the 16th November. 236 men had so far reached Turkey from the island. The enemy had announced the capture of 200 officers and3,000 other ranks, from which one could estimate that 500 Britishtroops had. been killed or were missing. The remaining British and greek troops had been withdrawn from Samos.The week had been satisfactory on the Russian front. On theNorthern flank of the Kiev salient the Russians had made bigadvances, capturing Ovruch and Korosten.German attacks on the Southern flank had succeeded inretaking Zhitomir, but did not appear to be a serious danger to theRussian position.   Some snow had been reported on the front.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
Parliament.Leros.Old age pensions.Pay of women in the CivilService.3. The Deputy Prime Minister said that notice had been given of&quot; a number of Parliamentary Questions to be asked on -thefollowing day regarding the fall of Leros. In answer to these, he proposed to say that he would make a statement on the subject inthe course of his speech in the Debate on the Address on the.24th November. He read to the War Cabinet a first draft of this statement, which was based on material furnished by the Chiefs ofStaff.It was suggested in discussion that some reference might beadded to the capture of Sardinia and Corsica, where risks somewhat similar to those accepted in the Dodecanese had been taken withsuccessful results.The War Cabinet were informed that a request might be madefor publication of the full Naval losses in these operations. It was contrary to the&quot; general practice to publish such statements (though this had been done after the original landing in North Africa), and-there was reason to believe that the enemy&apos;s information of ou*losses on this occasion was incomplete. It was agreed that anyrequest for such publication on this occasion should be resisted.The War Cabinet Endorsed the general&apos; lines of the statement which the deputy Prime Minister proposed to make; and took note that the Service Ministers would be given an opportunityfor detailed comment on the draft before its terms were finally settled.The Deputy Prime Minister said that there was to be a private notice Question on the following day asking whether facilities would be given to discuss the Petition, which had been presented toParliament on behalf of old age pensioners. It was proposed to-state in reply that there would be an opportunity during the forth-coming Session to discuss the question of old age pensions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Sir DouglasHacking, M.P., had given notice of a Question on the subject of equal pay for men and women in the Civil Service. He proposedto repeat an earlier statement by his predecessor to the effect thatthe Government did not accept the principle of equal pay for menand women in the Civil Service. If he was asked whether an enquiry could he held on this question, he proposed to take the line that the Government could not agree to hold such an enquiry inwar time.The War Cabinet Approved the line which it was proposed to take in replying to this Question.The Lebanon.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 159thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The War Cabinet discussed the latest developments in the&apos;Lebanon. The French Committee had now recalled M. Helleu, hadreleased and reinstated the President, and had released the LebaneseMinisters, but without reinstating them. -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the WarCabinet two telegrams (Nos. 248 and 249) from the resident minister at Algiers. Mr. Macmillan stated that he had given anote to M. Massigli, making it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Governnientattached great importance to the view that the released ministers were the constitutional Government of the Lebanon and that hetrusted that it was on this basis that negotiations for a modu-svivendi in the Lebanon would now proceed.
Mr. Macmillan also stated that he thought that public opiniongenerally would take the view that the French had given way to us.He thought that the French might try to make an arrangement withthe President which would involve some change of Ministers; andhe enquired whether, if they attempted to pursue this course, weshould still insist on imposing martial law at 10 a.m. on thefollowing Wednesday.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the courseof events would now show whether we had been right in taking theview that the release of the Lebanese Ministers, without theirreinstatement, would not provide a solution of the situation. he still feared that a failure to reinstate the Ministers would mean a deadlock. But the matter was essentially one which must be judgedin the light of the local situation, and from now onwards could bemuch better handled in the Middle East than in London.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs circulated the draftof a telegram to the Prime Minister setting out this point of view and suggesting that, while we did not wish to declare martial lawif we could avoid it, the threat of it might well enable us to securesatisfaction on the outstanding issues.Discussion showed general agreement with the view that thematter was now one which could best be handled in the Middle East.On the other hand, the view was expressed that, as the concessionsmade by the French went a considerable way towards meeting ourdemands, it was unnecessary, and might be embarrassing, to leaveour original ultimatum unchanged, so that we should be obliged toimpose martial law on Wednesday, the 24th November, if by then theFrench had not met the remainder of our demands by reinstatingthe Lebanese Ministers.It was suggested that we should take the line that we withdraw the threat to impose martial law at 10 a.m. on the followingWednesday if our full demands had not been met by that date, butthat we retained the right to impose martial law should a situationarise which l^endered this course necessary.It was also suggested that the Prime Ministers attention should be drawn to certain statements in Mr. Macmillan&apos;s telegrams,which made it clear that the majority of the French national committee had overruled General de Gaulle in this matter.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to despatch the draft telegram to the Prime Minister, subjectto amendment to meet the points referred to at &quot;X&quot;and &quot; Y.&quot;Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,22nd November, 1943.
