The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, froman interview which he had had with the Polish Ambassador that morning, it seemed that the Polish Government at last recognisedthat it was in their interests that a settlement should be reached onthe questions in dispute between Russia and Poland; but that thePolish Government might, in all the circumstances, welcome theimposition of a settlement by the British and United states government.The War Cabinet  r -Took note of this statement.The Lebanon.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 155thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatGeneral Catroux had now arrived in Beirut, but that there had been no report yet of any interview between him and Sir Edward Spears.He thought that the time had now been reached when, in order toavoid further delay, we should instruct our representatives to saythat our demands must be complied with by a definite time. he accordingly proposed that, unless some definite indication had beenreceived from General Catroux by the evening of Thursday, the18th November, that the French were on the point of complying with our demands for the release of the imprisoned Ministers andthe dismissal of M. Helleu, the Minister of State Resident in theMiddle East should fly to Beirut on Friday, the 19th November, and inform General Catroux that, failing compliance with these demands by 10 a.m. on Sunday, the 21st November, British martial law would be immediately declared, and that in that case theimprisoned Ministers would be released. The Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs proceeded to read to the Cabinet the text of atelegram which had been prepared to give effect to this proposal.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considered that,should General Catroux express his readiness to release thePresident and Ministers, he should be asked to come to a conference with the released Ministers, under our general good offices, in orderto negotiate a modus vivendi. The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs read out a further draft telegram in this sense.The following points were made in discussion of these telegrams : (i) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs did. not proposethat our representative should at this stage say that, if our demands were not complied with, we should with-draw recognition from the French Committee,(ii) The United^ States attitude towards us had not been toofavourable, although there was a good deal of support for Britain in certain quarters.   It was important thatthe high authorities in the United States should beinformed of the action which we proposed and that, ifpossible, we should obtain their concurrence,(iii) The quarrel was between the French and the Lebanese,and. while we should do what we could to bring theparties together, and facilitate a settlement, we shouldnot go so far as to undertake that in certain circum-stances we would represent the Lebanese interests.[26445-4] B 21. The War Cabinet were informed that wireless communica-tion with our forces in Leros had ceased at 8 p.m. on the previous night, and from information received that morning from the middle east it seemed clear that our forces in the island had capitulatedon the previous night. The enemy had probably taken about 3,000British and 5,000 Italian prisoners.
(iv) It would not be desirable to include at this stage a provision that we would welcome arbitration from the UnitedStates between the French and Lebanese, although the offices of the United States might weil be useful at a later stage if an impasse arose.The War Cabinet-Agreed to the despatch of the draft telegrams prepared bythe Secretary of. State for Foreign Affairs, subject to such modifications as might be necessary to cover these points;and asked that the United States Government should beinformed of the action proposed.defence regulation 18B.(previous reference erence:W.M. (43) 12thConclusions,Minute 3.)Release ofSir oswald mosley.4. The Rome Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat a conference of all the medical advisers who had recently beenin&apos;attendance on Sir Oswald Mosley had advised that the conditionof his health was such that there might be a danger to his life if he were kept in detention. In the circumstances he thought that theright course would be to suspend the Detention Order, subject to conditions designed to impose the strictest practicable limitations on any political activities on the part of Sir Oswald Mosley.After some discussion, a full record of which is contained inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions, theWar Cabinet Agreed with the Home Secretary and Minister of home security&apos;s proposed course of action.supplementary pensions andUnemploymentAssistance.(previous reference:W.M. (43)107tbConclusions,Minute 2.)Relation toWar PensionsRates.5. The War Cabinet considered Memoranda by the Lord-President of the Council (W.P. (43) 508) and the Chancellor of theExchequer (W.P. (43) 512) regarding proposals which were about to be made hj the Assistance Board for the simplification and revision of their Regulations relating to supplementary pensionsand unemployment assistance.The Lord President of the Council reminded the War Cabinetthat the initiative for proposing changes in these Regulations rested with the Assistance Board; and that the Government, if they decided to lay before Parliament Regulations different from thosesubmitted by the Board, were under an obligation to inform Parlia-ment of the proposals made by the Board and. their reasons fordiffering from them. It was customary for the Board, before sub-mitting Regulations, to ascertain by informal consultation whether their proposals were likely to be acceptable to the ministers responsible for presenting them to Parliament. The present proposals were still at this stage of informal consultation; but, ason this occasion the Board&apos;s proposals concerned a number ofMinisters and raised important questions of policy, it had been thought convenient that this preliminary consideration should beundertaken by the Lord Presidents Committee, who were nowreporting their views to the War Cabinet.The Board&apos;s proposals (which were set out in L.P. (43) 231) hadbeen considered by the Lord Presidents Committee, who had givenparticular attention to the question of possible repercussions on theexisting rates of war pensions and the rates contemplated for theGovernment^ proposed scheme of social insurance.The Lord Presidents Committee were satisfied that the existing rates of war pensions were, in general, more favourable than thenew rates proposed by the Assistance Board; and that, in the few cases where the assistance rate would be higher, the Ministry ofPensions would be able by the exercise of an administrativediscretion, to secure that the war pensioner received an allowance atthe higher rate. The Committee considered, therefore, that theadoption of the new rates proposed by the Assistance Board wouldnot lead to any irresistible demand for a reopening of the recentsettlement of war pensions rates.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the basis of the two schemes was so different that there should be no difficulty in resistingany demand for a reopening of the recent pensions settlement. Hecould not, however, assent to the present proposals unless the WarCabinet as a whole were satisfied that such a demand could be resisted.Questions were raised in discussion regarding the method bywhich the war&apos; pensions rate would be supplemented in those few cases where it was lower than the new rate payable by the assistance board. Some Ministers felt that there would be serious criticism if, in such cases, the pensioner was left in the position of having to seek the supplementary payment from the Assistance Board.The Minister of Pensions said that in various classes of casethe Assistance Board already acted as the agents of his Departmentboth in making enquiries for the purpose of assessing need, and,where a war pension was supplemented, in making the paymentsauthorised. The Minister was asked whether he could not arrange that, in the cases now under discussion, the Assistance Board would merely make the original assessment Of need and that, when theamount of the supplementation had been determined, the whole amount payable to the pensioner would be paid by the Ministry ofPensions. The War Cabinet considered that such an arrangement would meet the objections which had been raised in the course of thediscussion.The Minister undertook to arrange that these cases would bedealt with on these lines.The War Cabinet (1) Endorsed the view that it would be possible to resist any demand for a reopening of the recent settlement of warpensions rates as a result of the introduction of the new rates now proposed by the Assistance Board for supple-mentary pensions and unemployment assistance; and agreed that any such demand should be resisted.Relation to pro- As regards the proposed scheme of social insurance, the Lordposed rates of Presidents Committee considered that the new rates proposed bysocial insurance the Assistance Board were unlikely to have any repercussions on thebenefit. proposed rate of unemployment benefit under the social insurancescheme. On the other hand, the Board&apos;s new rates for pensionerswould be distinctly more favourable than those of the contributory pensions under the social insurance scheme; and the attractions ofthose contributory pensions would to some extent be diminished bythe knowledge that more favourable rates would be payable by theAssistance Board on proof of need.The War Cabinet recognised that the more-generous rates nowproposed by the Assistance Board were bound to be made the basis for pressure to increase the rates contemplated under the Govern-ments new scheme of social insurance. On the question whether itwould be possible to resist this pressure, there was some difference ofopinion.The Paymaster-General suggested that the proposed new ratesof assistance were equivalent to those put forward in the beveridge report, if account were taken of Sir William Beveridge&apos;s proposalfor children&apos;s allowances at 8s. a week. When the. Governmentpresented their new scheme, of social insurance, they were bound tobe pressed to raise the rate of children&apos;s allowances from 5s. to 8s.in order to bring the rate of social security benefits up to the general level of the new rates of assistance, in his view the adoption ofthese new rates would have the consequence that, unless the Govern-ment were prepared to increase children&apos;s allowances to 8s., theGovernments scheme of social insurance would be represented asless generous than either the Beveridge scheme or the Assistance- Board&apos;s rates and the Government would fail to gain any credit forthe introduction of their scheme.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the War Cabinetthat the Government had already announced a firm decision that therate of children&apos;s allowances would be 5s. a week. This announce-ment, which had been coupled with an assurance of extendedassistance in kind, had on the whole been favourably received. Hewas not himself prepared to contemplate raising the rate to 8s.;and he thought it most important that the Government shouldrepudiate any argument founded on the assumption that children&apos;allowances were related (as were the Board&apos;s rates) to the full cost of maintain ing a child.The Minister of Labour and National Service said it was notillogical that there should be disparities between the rates ofassistance and the rates of benefit under the social insurance scheme;and he thought there should be no difficulty in defending thesedisparities if the Government adhered firmly to the principle that,while the former were designed to cover the maintenance of persons with no other resources and were subject to a test of need, the latter were contractual benefits paid as of right in return for contributions.Benefits under a scheme of contributory insurance had never been designed to meet the needs of all contributors. The Government hadbeen careful to reject Sir William Beveridge&apos;s argument that benefitrates under the insurance scheme should be related to the cost ofmaintenance; and it was most important that the Governmentshould make no claim that the rates proposed under their schemeof social insurance were sufficient to meet the average cost ofmaintenance. If this were clearly stated, the Government could accept the position that applicants who proved need would beentitled to obtain higher rates of assistance from the assistance board.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was unfortunate that these proposals should have been made by the Assistance board at a time when the Government intended shortly to present their scheme of social insurance. He feared that these proposals wouldhave the result that the rates proposed under that scheme would berepresented as ungenerous. He could, however, assent to the Board&apos;sproposals if the War Cabinet as a whole were prepared to resist(on the basis of the argument outlined by the Minister of Labour and national Service) the demand that the rates of benefit under thesocial insurance scheme should be raised to the general level of therates payable by the Assistance Board.The Minister of Health said that in the short time since hehad assumed office he had not been able to go into these proposals in great detail. On the whole, however, he was disposed to thinkthat the proposals of the Assistance Board could be accepted, though he feared that some difficulty might arise from the treatment ofdisregards.The War Cabinet-(2) Recognised that the new rates proposed by the assistance board would probably be made the basis of demands toincrease the rates contemplated for the Government&apos;scheme of social insurance; but agreed that thosedemands should be resisted by reference to the considera-tions mentioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Labour and National Service, as outlined above.Winter The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to certainAllowances. alterations proposed by the Assistance Board for the purpose ofsimplifying the existing Regulations. The most important of these was the proposal to abolish the existing differentiation between the allowances payable in winter and in summer. The Chancellorpointed out that, if the Government were to use the argument ofsimplification to justify levelling up the summer rate to the winterrate, it would be necessary for the Government to resist, on the
ground of avoiding complexity, any subsequent pressure there mightbe to acid to the new rate a special supplement in respect of winterconditions. He could only assent to the present proposal if the WarCabinet were satisfied that the argument of simplicity could continue to outweigh the strong arguments which would subse-quently be advanced on merits for increasing the allowances payable in the winter months.The War Cabinet (3) Agreed that, if the existing differentiation between winter and summer allowances were abolished, any subsequentpressure for a supplementary allowance in the winter months should be resisted on the ground of avoidingfurther complexity in the Regulations.The Chancellor of the Eaicheqtcer drew attention to the cost ofthe Board&apos;s proposals. They would increase by  6f millions thecost ( 43-^ millions in the current financial year) of supplementary pensions; and the additional cost of the changes in unemployment assistance would be  6 millions for every 500,000 applicants.The War Cabinet were informed that, when the draft Regula-tions had been formally submitted by the Assistance Board, theRegulations would be made and presented to Parliament togetherwith an explanatory White Paper. It was the view of the WarCabinet that the Regulations and the White Paper should be presented to Parliament soon after the opening of the new Sessionso that, if parliamentary time were available, they could be debatedbefore the Christmas Recess.It was agreed that some ill-informed criticism might be avoidedduring the Debate if arrangements could be made for the ministers primarily concerned to discuss the Regulations in advance of the debate at an informal meeting with representatives of the variouspolitical Parties.The War Cabinet-(4) Agreed that, if the Assistance Board submitted draft regulations giving effect to the proposals outlined inL.P. (43) 231, the Ministers concerned might proceed tomake those Regulations without amendment and topresent them to Parliament.(5) Took note that it was proposed to present the regulations to Parliament, with an explanatory White Paper, earlyin the new Session.(6) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Labour and National Service, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofHealth, &apos; to arrange for an informal meeting with members of Parliament representing the main political parties so that the Ministers might have an opportunityof explaining the Governments attitude towards these regulations before they were debated in the House ofCommons.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,17th November, 1943.
