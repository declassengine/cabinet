Post-WarRelief.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 171stConclusions,Minute 2.)Relief forEx-enemy territories.XFinance of relief duringthe MilitaryPeriod.[26636]1.   The War Cabinet had before them the following papers : A Report by the Minister of Food on the first session of theCouncil of UNRRA (W.P. (43) 567);A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in regard to certain follow-up action which would be needed on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government (W.P. (43)579); andA Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on theFinance of Relief (W.P. (43) 581).Points in discussion were :  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention toResolution No. 1 I (3) (page 6 of the White Paper), whichempowered UNRRA to operate in an enemy or ex-enemy area,provided that the Council approved the scale and nature of theoperations it was proposed to undertake and the standard of provision, and that all expenses connected with such possibleoperations should be carried by the enemy or ex-enemy country concerned. If the correct interpretation of this resolution was thatmoneys available to UNRRA might be used for the supply of enemy or ex-enemy territories, provided that a claim for payment was raised against them, such a claim to receive a priority among other claims as might be decided outside UNRRA, he would have noobjection. He was not, however, prepared to agree that we, togetherwith the United States Government and other suppliers, should carry the cost of necessary relief to ex-enemy territories, in so faras they could not pay, as an addition to our contribution to UNRRA.The Minister of Food said that, in his view, the wording of theresolution could be interpreted in the manner desired by theChancellor of the Exchequer. The European Allies had, however,bitterly opposed any suggestion that UNRRA should operate in enemy countries, except for the purpose of preventing the spread ofepidemics or of performing other activities which could be shown to be of direct benefit to the liberated nations rather than to theenemy population. The question of finance of relief for enemy orex-enemy territories would no doubt come up for discussion, whenit had emerged in a concrete form, at later meetings of the Councilof UNRRA. By that time the situation might have changed in sucha way as to cause the European Allies to alter their attitude.The view of the War Cabinet was that it was desirable thatUNRRA should be concerned in provision of supplies to enemy orex-enemy territories in order that it could assure itself that adequate supplies were reserved for Allied territories. It would,however, be unwise at the present moment to raise the question ofresponsibility for the cost of relief to enemy or ex-enemy territories in so far as they could not be made to pay for it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be satisfiedif the War Cabinet accepted the view that the provision of relief for enemy or ex-enemy territories should be carried out through themachinery of UNRRA, on the basis that repayment would constitute a priority claim on the resources of the territories in question.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer feared that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might be called upon to pay substantial sums, over and above their contribution to UNRRA, in respect of relief suppliedduring the military period, unless the Military Authorities invokedthe assistance of UNRRA in the provision of such supplies at anearly stage. He accordingly proposed that the departmentsconcerned should consider urgently the possibility of arranging thatthe requirements of the Military&quot; Authorities for civilian supplies should be at a very early stage cast in the form of a request for supplies financed by UNRRA.Attention was drawn to the danger that considerations offinance might lead to the premature introduction of the UNRRAmachine into the military arrangements. It was felt, however, thatit should be possible to avoid this danger by arranging that require-ments for civilian supplies should be administered by the Militaryb 2
Authorities so long as the Military situation required, even if theywere financed from UNRRA sources from a very early stage.As regards civilian supplies during the Military period, whichwere not financed from UNRRA sources, the suggestion was made that we should seek an agreement with the United States Govern-ment whereby the proportion of the cost of these supplies to be borneby each of the two Governments would be calculated in the same way as their respective contributions to UNRRA. In favour of thisproposal, it was urged that, in the absence of such an understanding,we might be called upon to share the cost with the United StatesGovernment on a fifty-fifty basis.The Minister of Production, on the other hand, thought that,if no special steps were taken to reach an understanding with theUnited States Government, the result might be that the cost wouldbe borne by the supplying countries; and he wondered whether, inthat case, our share might not be less than it would be under thearrangement proposed.It was agreed that these matters required further considera-tion before a decision could be reached.(c) The Minister of Aircraft Production asked what arrange-ments would be made for the provision of relief supplies toterritories in Eastern Europe likely to be occupied by the Russians.The Minister of Food said that this question had been raised at Atlantic City by the representatives of the Polish Government,but that no decisions had been taken.The War Cabinet felt that this also was a matter which required further consideration before our policy was decided.Scale of (d) The Pay master-General asked on what assumptions, in contributions. regard to the amount of supplies to be made available for relief, theproposed scale of financial contributions to UNRRA was based.He thought that the estimates which had been made of the require-ments of liberated territories were altogether too high, and that,similarly, the scale of contributions was excessive. According tohis information, the total cost of the supplies which it would reallybe necessary to make available for relief purposes to countries whichcould not pay for them would not be more than about  40 or 50 millions.It was explained that the object of fixing the contributions at per cent, of each country&apos;s national income had been to settle the proportions in which each country should contribute to the expensesof UNRRA, and that no commitments had been taken about thetotal amount to be spent. All estimates of relief requirements wouldbe closely scrutinised, both by the Supplies Committee of UNRRAand by the Combined Boards, before allocations were made, and wewere in no way committed to any estimates.The conclusions of the War Cabinet were as follows : (1) The War Cabinet recorded their appreciation of the ablemanner in which the Minister of Food and his delega-tion had handled the case of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the first session of the Council.(2) The proposal of the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs that the resolutions adopted at Atlantic City should bepublished       White Paper was approved.(3) The proposals in sub-paragraph (c) of the Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43)579) in regard to the representation of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on the Committees set up by the Council of unrra were approved.(4) General agreement was expressed with the view that weshould do our best to- provide a number of experiencedand capable officials for service on the staff of UNRRAand that Ministers who were asked for assistance shouldtreat the request sympathetically.Relief forTerritories inEasternEurope.
In this connection the War Cabinet were informed of certain proposed appointments, including that ofSir Arthur Salter as senior Deputy Director-General ofAdministration in Washington.(5) The proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that our contribution to the finance of UNRRA should be 80,000,000 was approved. It. was explained that this sum represented the nearest round figure above 1 per cent,of our estimated national income for the year ended the30th June, 1943.(6) It was agreed that our contribution to the finance ofITNRRA should be charged against the Vote of Credit,and that Parliamentary authority for an extension ofthe ambit of the Vote of Credit to cover this charge should be sought when the next Vote of Credit was presented.It was suggested, that this would also be the most convenient occasion for a debate on the White Paperreferred to at (2) above.(7) The view regarding the finance of relief for enemy orex-enemy territories set out at &quot; X &quot; above was endorsed.(8) The Minister of State was invited to arrange for the points raised at (b) and (c) above to be examined by the Depart-ments concerned and for a report to be submitted to theWar Cabinet.(9) It was agreed that for the time being no public statement should be made in regard to the finance of relief for enemy or ex-enemy territories or of such civiliansupplies during the Military period as were not financed by UNRRA.The need for 2.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by themore High Lord Chancellor (W.P. (43) 573) making proposals for an additionGoHrt Judges.    to the number of High Court Judges.The Lord Chancellor explained the extremely unsatisfactoryposition as regards divorce suits. Between 3,000 and 4,000 cases were now entered. There was also a good deal of delay in disposing of various lists in the King&apos;s Bench Division.The Lord Chancellor reminded the War Cabinet that there was already power to increase the number of Puisne Judges in theKing&apos;s Bench Division from 17 to 19 if the state of business in thatDivision so required, on the passing of a resolution by both houses of Parliament. There was a similar power in regard to the appoint-ment of one Puisne Judge in the Probate, Divorce and admiralty division. There was also a power to appoint a sixth ChanceryPuisne Judge. In this case, however, no resolution was needed.The&apos; appointment could be made on his recommendation with theconcurrence of the Treasury.In the Lord Chancellors view, however, what was required wasauthority to appoint additional High Court Judges without reference to the state of work in a particular Division. he accordingly proposed that the existing provisions as to the appoint-ment of additional judges in all the Divisions under certain conditions should be repealed and a new provision substituted,giving authority to appoint a maximum of 6 additional judges.This would be an increase in the permanent strength. He would atonce make an order to enable contested Divorce cases to be tried atAssizes, and would appoint three new Judges. [The total numberof Judges was now below the existing statutory maximum.]In discussion, the question was raised whether parliament would be likely to object to the repeal of the present procedurewhereby resolutions had to be passed in both Houses beforeadditional judges could be appointed and to substitute therefor a power to appoint additional judges on the advice of the LordChancellor, subject to the concurrence of the Chancellor of theExchequer.
The Lord Chancellor said that procedure by resolution made itnecessary to wait until arrears had accumulated before a case couldbe established for the appointment of an additional judge. It wassurely better to take action to prevent any congestion arising.Furthermore, the correct way of looking at the matter was that itwas now proposed to obtain authority for a permanent increase inthe judicial strength, and there was no reason why the appointmentswithin this increased strength should be subject to approval on each occasion by Parliament.The question was also raised whether Parliament would belikely to ask that the length of the judicial vacation should bereduced before a permanent increase in the judicial strength was authorised. The Lord Chancellor drew attention to the steps whichhad been taken to shorten judicial vacations during the war.Experience had shown, however, that, although facilities had beenmade available during the long vacation, very few cases had come on for trial.The Solicitor-General and the Minister of Aircraft Productionsaid that experience showed that the opposition to the shorteningof the long vacation came from the Solicitors, who took the view thata long vacation was necessary to enable them to catch up with thearrears of routine business.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Lord Chancellor to arrange for a Bill onthe lines described in his Memorandum to be drafted, witha view to its introduction as early as possible in theNew Year.Post-War 3.   The  War  Cabinet  considered,  a Memorandum by the-Highway Minister of Reconstruction (W.P. (43) 571) submitting recommen-Policy. dations by the Reconstruction Problems Committee, and the draftof a statement of policy, on post-war highway policy.Points in discussion were : (a) In paragraph 3 of the draft statement of policy it was stated that proposals for the improvement and extension of the road system must be framed with full regard to the interests of town and country planning and the location of industry.The Minister of Reconstruction pointed out that this might provoke the criticism that, in that event, a statement on highwaypolicy should not precede the formulation of Government policy inrespect of town and country planning and location of industry.(b) With reference to paragraph 16 of the draft statement, itwas asked whether it was intended to proceed with the scheme fora bridge over the Plumber.The War Cabinet were informed that this was among the&quot; other schemes &quot; to which reference was made in the statement;but it was felt that the Severn Bridge had the highest priority andon that account merited specific mention.The War Cabinet were also informed that there were goodgrounds for proceeding with the project for a bridge over the Severnwithout awaiting a decision on. the question of a Severn Barrage.(c) In paragraph 4 of the draft statement it was said that theGovernment proposed to frame legislation &quot; which would substan-tially increase, and perhaps go near to doubling, the existing mileage-of trunk roads.&quot;It was suggested that it was unnecessary for the government at this stage to commit themselves so precisely as regards the extentto which the central Government would take over responsibility forfurther trunk roads. There was no particular advantage inincluding the words &quot; and perhaps go near to doubling,&quot; and itwould be preferable that this point should be left open.
275W,M. 175 (43).It was also suggested that consideration might be given to thepossibility of framing the necessary legislation in such a way thatthe central Government would be able to assume responsibility forfurther stretches of road without having to promote a special Billon each occasion.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendation set out in paragraph 1 of w.P. (43) 571.(2) Authorised the Minister of War Transport to make astatement of policy in the terms of the draft set out inthe Appendix to W.P. (43) 571, subject to the omissionfrom paragraph 4 of that draft of the words &quot;and perhaps go near to doubling.&quot;Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,23rcl December, 1943.
