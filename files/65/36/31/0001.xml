The Vice-Chiefs of Staff reported the. principal events ofthe previous week.The main efforts of Bomber Command during the past weekhad been directed against Berlin, which had been heavily attacked on three nights, and harassed by Mosquitoes on two others. In all,1,600 aircraft attacked Berlin during the week for the loss of72 aircraft. Stuttgart had also been attacked. No photographshad yet been obtained of any of the raids on Berlin, but reports from neutral sources appeared to confirm that these attacks had been most successful.The United States Air Force had made a total of 1,750 sorties.The heaviest attack had been against Bremen.Coastal Command had made 580 sorties during the week andhad attacked 3 U-boats, of which 2 were possibly damaged. Inattacks on enemy shipping one 10,000-ton tanker had probably been sunk.Fighter Command and Tactical Air Force had made 3,250sorties.  Enemy activity had been veryjight.Allied activity had increased slightly over the previous week.United States Fortresses had made a successful attack on the U-boatbase at Toulon. United States Liberators had attacked Sofiamarshalling yards.Shipping losses for the week by enemy action had totalled17,000 tons, making a total of 98,000 tons during the month. TwelveU-boats had been sunk or probably sunk during the month; this didnot include a number of attacks during the last 48 hours, for whichreports were still outstanding.The first of the resumed Russian convoys had arrived without loss at Murmansk at the beginning of the week.An attack had been made by a large number of U-boats on a convoy homeward bound between Gibraltar and the UnitedKingdom, but all had been driven off by the escort vessels and the convoy had proceeded undamaged.During an attack by aircraft on a convoy off the North african coast one ship carrying United States troops had been sunk; it was feared that casualties were high.In an action in the South-West Pacific United States light forces had claimed to have sunk 5 out of a force of 6 Japanesedestroyers; an American aircraft had probably sunk a Japanesesubmarine which was engaged in rescuing survivors.By the end of the previous week the weather had clearedsufficiently to enable the. 8th Army to launch a full-scale attackacross the Sangro. This was proceeding as well as could be expected.On the 5th Army front enemy resistance showed no signs of weakening.The Germans had occupied Samos on the 22nd November, afterthe successful evacuation of almost the whole British garrison, theregular Greek troops, about one-third of the Greek guerrilla forces and one-third of the original Italian garrison.The position of the guerrillas in Greece and Yugoslavia was deteriorating.The Russians had had considerable success north of Gomel andhad continued to advance north-west of that city and along thelower reaches of the Rivers Beresina and Pripet.German counter-attacks against the Kiev salient had so farachieved only limited successes, and the Russians now appeared tchave the situation in hand.   Reports indicated that weather ancground conditions were deteriorating in this sector.Sattelberg in New Guinea had been captured by the australians, and the Japanese had been forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.American forces had completely occupied one atoll in theGilbert Islands and had established themselves on two others.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.L26530]

(43) 16thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Information (W.P. (43) 533) asking whether Red ArmyDay, which was to be celebrated in the Soviet Union on the23rd February, 1944, should be signalised by an officially organiseddemonstration in this country.The Memorandum gave particulars of the official celebrationof Red Army Day organised in February 1943 and summarised the considerations for and against arranging a similar celebration in1944. The conclusion of the Minister of Information was that theGovernment should refrain from organising any official demonstra-tions; but that there might be some relaxation of the rule ofboycotting demonstrations arranged by private organisations.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security pointedout the practical difficulties involved in making any such relaxations,and said that, on general grounds, it was his view that some large-scale demonstration ought to be organised by the Government, evenif it were not on quite the same elaborate lines as last year. Theexploits of the Red Army since the last/celebration had been evenmore striking than before, and we should take the opportunity of publicly demonstrating our friendship with the Soviet Union. Theabsence of an official celebration would leave the way open to theCommunist Party of Great Britain to exploit the occasion for theirown purposes, and he did not attach much importance to thearguments that any Ministerial speeches would have to repeat thetheme already fully dealt with last time, or that a second year&apos;sobservance would tend to make the celebration - an annual event,pointing out that, in any case, this need only apply until the end ofthe European war.In discussion, there was general agreement with the views ofthe Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, although it wassuggested that the celebration could properly be on a smaller scale than last time, since on that occasion the 25th anniversary of the foundation of the Red Army was being celebrated. It was suggestedthat it would meet the situation if there was one organised demon-stration in London and one demonstration each in Scotland, wales and Northern Ireland.Various detailed suggestions were made as to the form whichthese demonstrations might take.The War Cabinet-Decided that official demonstrations should be organised to celebrate Red Army Day in 1944, although on a lesselaborate scale than in 1943, and invited the Minister ofInformation, after consultation with the Departmentsconcerned, to submit detailed proposals as to the form which these celebrations should take.Coal.Man-Power&apos;f orthe coal mining industry.(previous reference:W.M, (43) 162ndConclusions,Minute 1.)4. At their meeting on the 26th November the War cabinet had approved proposals made by the Minister of Labour and national Service for selecting by ballot fit men of military age for compulsory call-up to the coal-mines. The question had then been raised whether persons who had volunteered for, and had beenaccepted by, one of the Services before reaching the age of compulsory military service would be excluded from the ballot; and,subsequent to the meeting, it had been suggested that there wasdoubt whether men accepted for the Services could legally be brought within the ballot, and that for this reason it might be necessary to
restrict the acceptance by the Services of young men volunteeringbefore reaching the age of compulsory military service.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that it was clear that volunteers who were accepted and became members of the armed Forces ceased to be liable to the National Service Acts, eventhough they might be placed temporarily on a reserve. In thesecircumstances, he asked that approval should be given to thefollowing formula, namely, that it would be necessary to restrict theacceptance of young men, apart from the special classes referred toat the previous discussion, who volunteered for the Services before reaching the age of compulsory military service. Such an agreement would not affect men who had already been accepted by the Services,but it should safeguard the future. It was essential, for the successof his scheme, that the classes excluded from the ballot should belimited to the minimum, and he could not contemplate an arrange-ment whereby a young man could secure exemption from the ballotmerely by securing his acceptance as a volunteer for the Services atthe age of 17.In discussion, it was suggested that these proposals would puta stop to volunteering at the age of 17 in order to secure the enrol-ment for the coal-mines at the age of 18 of only a comparatively small percentage of the youths concerned. Importance was attachedby the Services to the present arrangement whereby they obtained a continuous flow of volunteer recruits of a good type, who entered the Services at the age of 17.It was suggested, that it might be practicable to arrange foryouths who wished to volunteer for one of the Services at the ageof 17 to have their names entered on a voluntary register, on theunderstanding that they would not be formally enrolled (unless theybelonged to the specialist classes) until the result of the ballot was known.The Minister of Labour and National Service said, however,that the administrative difficulties in the way of such an arrange-ment were insuperable.The Secretary of State for War drew attention to the fact that under the Minister of Labour&apos;s formula it was intended only to&quot; restrict,&quot; and not abolish, the acceptance of young men whovolunteered before reaching the age of compulsory military service,and, in view of an assurance given by the Minister of Labour and national Service that the scheme would be administered withflexibility, he said that he was prepared to accept the proposal. in giving this assurance, however, the Minister, of Labour and NationalService again emphasised that he was not prepared to consider any arrangement which would allow a young man to escape the ballotmerely by getting himself accepted as a volunteer by one of the armed Forces.The War Cabinet-Accepted the * proposal of the Minister of Labour and national Service that, as a necessary corollary of thescheme approved at their last meeting, it would benecessary to restrict the acceptance of young men, apartfrom those going into certain special classes, whovolunteered for the Services before reaching the age of compulsory military service; and invited him to work outthe necessary detailed arrangements forthwith in consul-tation with the three Service Ministers.5.   The War Cabinet further discussed the course of the debate on the Address.Tuesday, 30th November.The War Cabinet discussed the line which the Minister ofProduction should take in dealing with matters affecting town and country planning, with the Uthwatt Report, and with control ofindustry in the transition period.
Wednesday, 1st December.The War Cabinet decided that in the Debate on the suspension of the Detention Orders in the case of Sir Oswald Mosley and LadyMosley the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security should speak early in the afternoon, and the Attorney-General should beinvited to wind up on behalf of the Government.Thursday, 2nd December.It was understood that an amendment on Dominion co-opera-tion was likely to be moved. In this event, the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs would speak earlyin the Debate and the Deputy Prime Minister undertook to replyfor the Government towards the end of the Debate.It was suggested that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs should make a statement on Newfound-land, and should indicate that the Government would be preparedto find further time for a discussion of this issue at a later date.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for DominionAffairs was invited to ascertain from the authorities of theHouse whether this procedure was in order.Friday, 3rd December.If the amendment in regard to pensions of State servants was moved, the Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to speak onbehalf of the Government.It was understood that an amendment dealing with foodshortages and agricultural matters might also be moved on this day.Tuesday, 7th December.It seemed likely that the Labour Party amendment might be moved on this date. A decision as to the Government Spokesman onthis occasion was deferred for a few days.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,2Qth November, 1943.

The HomeSecretary said that, in his view,   it was essential toretain these powers, at least until the war in Europe. - was over.The Home Secretary said that certain articleshad appeared in the Press, stating that the actionwhich he had taken in this matter had been taken against the advice of one member of the War Cabinet.He referred to this matter with some reluctance;    buthe assumed the War Cabinet would take the line that bemust refuse to be drawn on this point,,The War Cabinet endorsed this view and pointedout that,  in any event, proceedings in Cabinet couldnot be revealed save with the consent of His Majesty, The King.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEstated that he regretted that he did not see h^s wayto support the action taken by the Home Secretary.He regarded the Mosleys as among the worst enemies ofthis country.      He would not feel able to vote insupport of the action which the Home Secretary hadtaken;    and as he would not have recourse to thesubterfuge of abstaining from voting if the mattercame to a division, he felt that his only course mightto be resign from the Government.

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said thathe felt as strongly as the Minister of Labour inregard to the Mosleys;    hut he did not think that the suspension of the Detention Order had resulted in Sir Oswald Mosley escaping from  the kind of control towhich he ought to he subjected.      Further, he reminded the War Cabinet that action taken in this matter wasthe personal responsibility of a particular Minister -the Home Secretary,      The Home Secretary &apos;s colleagues in the War Cabinet did not share his responsibilities in-[hi 3 matter in trie same sense as in other matters which were the subject of War Cabinet decisions.      Ina matter of this.kind the War Cabinet were entitledto learn from the Home Secretary the action which he proposed to-take, and to put to him such considerationsas occurred to them      The decision, however, was theHome Secretary&apos;s personal decision;    and all that theWar Cabinet could then do was to make up their mindswhether the Home Secretary had exercised his discretionproperly..The Chancellor of the Exchequer added thatthe decisions taken by the Home Secretary;   in mattersof this kind, were very similar to the decisions takenby the Attorney-General as to whether to proceed with or abandon a prosecution in a parti cular oaos.      Onsuch occasions his Ministerial colleagues had to forbearfrom bringing pressure to bear on the Attorney-general in favour of,  or against, a particular course ofaction.      But when the decisions had been taken, theGovernment might have to consider whether they could,support a Law Officer who had exercised his discretion in a particular wayDContinuing, the Chancellor of the exchequer said that, as he understood the medical evidence, hethought that the Home Secretary bad taken the only course which he or any other Minister in his position could have taken,      The Chancellor concluded by sayingthat if, when he had been Home Secretary,  he hadallowed&apos;his judgment to be&apos;over-ridden by the Cabinetin deciding what people should be detained under regulation I8B, then&quot;his action would have been liableto have been over-ridden by the CourtsnTHE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER and other Ministersspoke in the same sense,  in support of the views putforward by the Chancel lor of the Exchequer,Offices of the War Cabinet,&apos;S, W. 1,
