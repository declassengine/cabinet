(43) 98thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Education (W.P. (43) 540) covering thedraft Education Bill, together with a Note outlining the main features of the Bill (H.P.C. (43) 136).The following were the main points of the discussion : (a) Functions of the Ministry.The President of the Board of Education said that it was proposed to add a new paragraph to Clause 92, saving the positionof the University Grants Committee.
(b) Title of the Minister.The view was expressed that it was a great pity to abolish the title of &quot; President of the Board of Education.&quot; It was explainedthat there were practical disadvantages in retaining the Board ofEducation.The President of the Board of Education undertook to consider and report to the War Cabinet on a suggestion that, while the board should be abolished, the Minister should retain the title of&quot; President of the Board.&quot;(c) Cadet Corps.It was pointed out that no reference was made to cadet corps inthe Bill. It was suggested that such a reference might be includedin Clause 52 (1).The President of the Board of Education said that the referenceto &apos;&apos; other bodies &apos;&apos; in Clause 41 (3) was regarded as drawn insufficiently wide terms to cover cadet corps. He was unwilling torefer specifically to cadet training in the Bill, as if he did so, itwould be necessary also to refer to Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, youthmovements and the like.The War Cabinet agreed that no amendment should be insertedmaking specific reference to cadet corps in the clauses of the bill which dealt with further education, but that the President of theBoard of Education should make it clear, in Iris speech on the SecondReading, that the Bill, as drafted, permitted appropriate arrange-ments to be made for cadet training.(d) Young People&apos;s Colleges.The question was raised whether any provision should be madefor religious education in young people&apos;s colleges. It was urgedthat, if this was not done, it would be argued that the State wasproviding general education of a purely secular character in thesecolleges.The President of the Board of Education said that he had told the Youth Council of the Churches that, if they wished religiousinstruction to be provided in young people&apos;s colleges, the right coursewould be that the various denominations should join together in asking for arrangements to be made for undenominational worship.This had already been done, in certain instances, e.g., atWalthamstow.The War Cabinet agreed that the President of the Board ofEducation should deal with the matter on these lines.(e) Recovery of Cost of Meals.Reference was made to the provision in Clause 51 whereby theLocal Education Authority was required to recover the cost ofmeals, &amp;e, supplied to school children from parents who could afford to pay. At the meeting of the Legislation Committee two daysearlier, the President of the Board of Education had undertaken to look into this matter, in consultation with the Treasury.The President of the Board of Education read to the WarCabinet a draft amendment, which had been prepared to take theplace of Clause 51 (2), designed to give the President of the Boardof Education power to make Regulations to proyide what,sums, ifany, should be recoverable. He also read a draft statement, to beincluded in the notes accompanying the Bill, making it clear thatthis Clause had been inserted so as to enable the matter to be adjusted in accordance with whatever decision was reached by theGovernment in regard to children&apos;s allowances.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had not had theopportunity of considering the terms of these drafts. He explainedthat his object was that the Government should not be committed
by the Education Bill to a provision which formed part of the social security Scheme as a whole, and should be dealt with on that basis.In discussion, it was suggested that, in any event, it would bedesirable to deal in separate Clauses with the provision in regardto repayment for board and lodging and with the provisions inregard to milk and school meals.On further consideration the view was expressed that the most satisfactory course would be to omit from the present education bill all provisions in regard to school meals, more especially seeing that, under the time-table proposed, these provisions could not comeinto operations until the 1st April, 1945, at the earliest.The President of the Board of Education undertook to examine this suggestion, and to submit a report on it to the War Cabinet, forconsideration at their Meeting on the following Monday.(f) Duties of Teachers in relation to School Meals.Objection was seen to Clause 49 (2), which provided that noteacher should be required to perform any services in connectionwith the preparation or serving of meals for pupils, except those ofsupervising the service of such meals and the conduct of the pupilsthereat.It was pointed out that there was a long history in regard tothis matter. Nevertheless, objection was seen to dealing, by statutory^ enactment, with a matter which should be one forreasonable arrangement between Local Authorities and teachers.Furthermore, the Secretary of State for Scotland pointed outthat this sub-section might well have a very hampering effect on theprovision of meals in single-teacher schools.The President of the. Board of Education undertook to submit a report on this matter to the War Cabinet on the following Monday.The War Cabinet-Adjourned consideration of the later Clauses of the bill until Monday, the 6th December, 1943.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,2nd December, 1943.
