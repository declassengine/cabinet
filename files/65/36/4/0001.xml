IEIndia.(Previous MenReference:W.M. (43) 71stConclusions,Minute 2.)THE   War   Cabinet   had   before   them  .the   followingaoranda: W.P. (43) 435 by the Secretary of State&apos; for India,indicating the lines on which the Viceroy Designate wished todeal with the political deadlockdn India.W.P. (43) 436 by the Lord President of the Council, givingthe views of the Cabinet Committee on India; to which was attached a Note of Dissent by the, Secretary of State for War.W.P. (43) 441 by the Secretary-o;  State for India, covering a summary of a recent press article by Mr. Rajagopalachariar.W.P. (43) 442 by the Prime Minister, covering an extractfrom a letter from Lord Croft.W.P. (43) 445 by the Prime Minister, indicating his viewson the proposals of the Viceroy Designate.The essence of the proposition put forward by the ViceroyDesignate was that an attempt to bring leaders of the indian political parties into the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council, althoughinvolving many short-term dangers, was the only course likely tofacilitate the post-war solution of the Indian constitutional problem.If this general conclusion were approved by the War Cabinet, theViceroy Designate proposed that if, after studying the situationand taking advice in India, he formed the opinion that there wasa reasonable chance that such an approach would be successful, heshould ask the War Cabinet to authorise him to invite a small number of the leaders of the Indian political parties to a private discussion among themselves, with a view to the inclusion of somerepresentatives of these parties in his Executive Council. Theleaders would first be asked to give a number of assurances, e.g., thatthey would lend their whole-hearted support to the war effort, andwould work together towards a solution of the constitutional problem. They would also be required to accept the position that,for the period of hostilities, the Executive Council must remain subject to the ultimate control of His Majesty&apos;s Government and parliament exercised through the present statutory powers of theGovernor-General.The Viceroy Designate would not invite the Indian leaders toparticipate in such discussions without asking the specific approvalof the War Cabinet, both for the timing of the approach and for the precise terms of the invitation.Annexed to the Memorandum was the draft of a statement onthe political situation which might be made by the ViceroyDesignate soon after his arrival in India (Annexure &quot;A&quot;), andthe draft of a Directive indicating the lines on which an approachmight be made to the Indian political leaders (Annexure &quot; B &quot;).This proposal had the support of the Secretary of State forIndia, and of the India Committee, with the exception of theSecretary of State for War, whose views were set out in a Note ofDissent annexed to W.P. (43) 436.The Prime Ministers Memorandum (W.P. (43) 445)summarised the risks which attended the course proposed.The Viceroy Designate and members of the India committee made statements in amplification of the memoranda submitted tothe War Cabinet in support of the course proposed.The following were among the main points raised in the courseof the subsequent discussion :  .It was generally accepted that it would be a mistake to assume        /that in no circumstances could any further advance be made duringthe war towards a solution of the constitutional problem in India.There was certainly no question of the Viceroy making a public declaration to that effect.On the other hand, doubts were expressed regarding the expediency of the course recommended by the Viceroy Designate.In particular :  (a) It was felt that the concluding words of the draft statementset out in Annexure &quot; A &quot; of W.P. (43) 435 went too far. A formal statement that the new Viceroy intended,
71W.M. 136 (43).&quot;with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government, toexamine whether a fresh attempt would appear to havegood prospects of success&quot; would be taken to imply adecision to reopen at once negotiations on theconstitutional issue. If the Viceroy made such astatement soon after his arrival in India, it was likely that public controversy over the constitutional positionwould break out afresh before he had had any oppor-tunity to study the situation and.to obtain advice upon it. Nor would controversy be confined to India. Itwould be bound to spread to this country and to theUnited States; and an atmosphere of public discussionmight well be created in which it would be impracticable to make any further progress in the matter.If a statement on the lines of Annexure &quot;A &quot; wasto be made, the concluding words ought, at least, to be amended so as to read : ... but I am, of course, free to examine whether a fresh attempt would appear tohave good prospects of success.&quot;(6) It was the view of the War Cabinet that it was in practiceimprobable that the Indian leaders, particularly theCongress leaders, would find it possible to give the assurances suggested in Annexure &quot; B&quot; to W.P. (43) 435,and when the conditions became known this might havean unfavourable effect on world opinion.(c) Gandhi, in particular, would almost certainly ask forelucidations and would seek to involve the Viceroy in an argument which might put the latter in a difficult position.(d) Difficulty would also arise as regards the Congress leadersat present under detention. Thus, Gandhi would nodoubt claim that he could not decide how to answer this invitation until he had been released; and it might bedifficult to avoid having to release him before he had first disavowed all intention of renewing civildisobedience.(e) There was much to be said in favour of leaving theinitiative, as it now remained, with the leaders of theIndian political parties. If, of their own initiative, theyprofessed a genuine change of heart and expressed a desire to resume discussions of the constitutional problem, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be in a farstronger position to secure a fruitful discussion, andthere would be much less risk of arousing controversyeither within. India or outside it.(/) It was suggested that the Viceroy would be ill-advised,at the outset of his term of office, to lay too great emphasis on the constitutional problem. Would it not be better that the new Viceroy should place in the forefront of hisprogramme the preparations for offensive operations against the Japanese, the regulation of food supplies andand the relief of famine conditions, and a sound policyin the development of social legislation and the improve-ment of the social condition of the Indian population ?The conclusions of the War Cabinet were as follows : (1) While it was, of course, open to the Viceroy at any time tosubmit recommendations to the War Cabinet if hethought that the moment was opportune for taking some further step which would assist a solution of theconstitutional problem, it was doubtful whether any advantage was to be gained by laying down at this stagetoo precise and definite a course of action before he had had a further opportunity of studying the politicalsituation on the spot and assessing the prospects ofsecuring further progress.
(2) It would be a mistake at this juncture to remove from theCongress leaders the onus of making a disavowal of theirpresent attitude; moreover as at present advised the WarCabinet were not prepared to embark on a policy of negotiations with Gandhi, which in their view wouldbe attended by grave inconvenience.(3) The Prime Minister undertook to prepare a Revised draftof the Annexures to W.P. (43) 435 in the light of thediscussion. These would be communicated to theSecretary of State for India and the Viceroy Designate,and thereafter to the War Cabinet. They could, ifnecessary, be discussed at the Meeting of the WarCabinet on the following day. .  &apos;.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,7th October, 1943.

He thought it might be desirable for the War Cabinet to have a preliminary discussion,without attempting to reach final conclusions.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the Viceroy Designatehad asked for guidance on the policy which he should followon taking up office.     After discussions in the india committee, general agreement had been reached (the Secretaryof State for War dissenting) on the line of approach tobe followed.      The essence of the proposal before theWar Cabinet was that the Viceroy should have discretion to explore the practicability of getting a small number of leaders of the different Indian Parties to come to a private discussion among themselves, with a view to the inclusion ofpolitical leaders in the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council.      Itwould, however, be an essential preliminary to the proposeddiscussion that the leaders -(i)(ii)should promiseeffort;whole-hearted support of the war should recognise that the new Constitution must bebased on agreement between the main elements ofIndia&apos;s national life;    and(iii)  should accept the position that,  during the war,there was no question of any constitutional change and the Viceroy&apos;s powers would remainunimpaired.
i
THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he had not regarded the proposal before the Cabinet as having the fundamentalcharacter suggested by the Prime Minister,     While theViceroy asked approval to the policy outlined, he wouldnot issue the proposed invitation without first coming backto the Cabinet for their authority.     Furthermore,  it wasmade abundantly clear that the Viceroy&apos;s position as theHead of the Executive Council would not be altered, although in practice his position might become a little more difficultThe Lord Chancellor said that his main difficultyarose from the fact that he thought it very unlikely thatthe Moslem and Hindu leaders would both accept the offer made.THE MINISTER OP AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION said thathis main concern was to create an atmosphere which wouldmake the Indian political leaders willing to keep indian the British Commonwealth after the war.     He thought the position was fully safe-guarded by the draft Directiveproposed.    All that the Viceroy Designate had in mind wasto make changes in the composition of the ExecutiveCouncil.     At the same time, he agreed that the chances of the Viceroy being in a position to recommend that theI time was appropriate to make the proposed approach was notvery favourable.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that hehad supported the proposal because he thought that noradical departure was involved from the commitments alreadyentered into.     The new Viceroy, on reaching India, was bound to have discussions with prominent Indians in thedifferent communities, and it was right that he shoiild knowin advance how far he would have the support of the WarCabinet in the line which he wished to take.      The chances of the Viceroy being able to achieve success on the lines proposed were, admittedly, not very favourable.     Neverthe-less,  he should be free to proceed on the lines proposed,subject to reference to the Cabinet when he thought thatthe time had come to make the proposed approach.THE &quot;SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR thought that,  if the approach v/as made, the most likely course would be that either the Moslems or the Hindus would refuse.      Theessential disadvantage of the course proposed was that by the mere issue of the invitation we abandoned theposition that it was for Crandhi and the other imprisonedCongress leaders to get themselves out of the mess into which they had landed themselves.      The issue of the invitation would restore Gandhi&apos;s stock to its old level,and make him once more dangerous to the Government.     Hethought that Jinnah would not declare his attitude until he knew what Gandhi was going to do.THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR INDIA agreed with theview expressed by the Minister of Aircraft Productionregarding the need for promoting a favourable atmosphere.It&quot;was important to make Indians feel that we stood by theprinciples to which we -were pledged, and that we were anxious to give them full scope to play their part in thewar effort.      In reply to the Prime Minister he said that,if an invitation was extended to Mr.  Gandhi and he refusedto give the pledges asked for, we should then be  justifiedin continuing to keep him in detention and refusing toallow him to communicate with persons outside.     At thesame time, he thought it was worth while to give theCongress leaders an opportunity to withdraw from the
1
itimpossible position in which they had put themselves.      he agreed that Gandhi was likely to try to quibble and startan argument;    but the Viceroy must refuse to be drawn into such discussion, and must make up his mind whether Gandhi&apos;sanswer constituted refusal or acceptance.The Secretary of State thought that timing was very important.      The Cripps offer had, in retrospect&quot;,&quot; beenmade at a most unfortunate time.      The atmosphere andconditions were already much better and might well continueto improve.Some discussion ensued as to whether it would bepossible to hold Gandhi in prison, if he asked for anopportunity to consult with leaders of the Congress Partywho were out of prison, before givinp; a final reply toany invitation addressed to him.THE PRIME MINISTER thought it would be difficult tosay that Gandhi was to be given no opportunity of consultation with those leaders of the Congress Party whowere not in prison.On the wider issue, the Prime Minister said that itwas, of course, abundantly clear that it would be open tothe Viceroy, if at any time after he had arrived in Indiaand surveyed the scene he came to the conclusion that an approach should be made to Gandhi, to make a recommendation to this effect to the War Cabinet,    It was, at all times,open to the Viceroy to make whatever submission he thought fit;    any proposals he put forward would receive the most careful consideration, and he would be given a definite answer.      It was, however, another matter to propose thatthe War Cabinet should agree now to the line of action proposed by the Secretary of State for India.THE VICEROY DESIGNATE referred to the commitments and undertakings of H.M. Government in regard to constitutional reform, as set out in recent statements made in Parliament.      In particular:, he referred to thefact that the Cripps offer was still open.      It was his duty, before leaving for India,  to explain to the WarCabinet how he viewed the situation and to acquaint himself with their views.It might be argued that it would have been better ifwe had taken a different line in 1917.     But there was nodoubt as to the goal to which we were now committed and towards which we must endeavour to make progress.One policy vms to say that we would make no attempt at progress    during the war.    On a short-term view this hadadvantages;    but from a long-term point of view it was, inhis view, dangerous.    The best prospect of India beingfriendly   to this country after the war lay in notdelaying an attempt to make a further advance at the presenttime.    The only way,  in his view, of making- progress was toinclude a   certain number of political leaders on theViceroy&apos;s Executive &quot;Council and to get them workingtogether, under the Viceroy, towards the solution of India sproblems.    These, of course, included the winning of thewarand social   and economic improvements.    He had no intentionof rushing matters, but as soon as possible he intended to sound some members of his Council, and a certain number of

the Provincial Governors and the political leaders, in orderto find out their views.     He thought that he would takesoundings of Rajagopalachariar and Jinnah.     All this might take some time;    but, if he was to achieve anything, the sooner something was done, the better.     He contemplated that the suggested approach might be made in, say, three or six months.     On the whole, he thought that, as the war wenton, the position was likely to become more intractable, whileowing to the many other pre-occupations, the end of a.  war was a bad time for making constitutional changes.     His idea was to get together a small number, say ten or twelve, of theleading Indians, including politicians and officials likeMudaliar, and ask them to address their minds to the whole problem and to consider whether it was possible to form a new council.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was, of course,nothing to prevent the Viceroy from discussing possibilitiesof this kind in the strictest confidence with trustworthyIndians.Continuing, LORD WAVELL said that the formation of aGovernment on the lines proposed would, of course, involve some risks.      On the other hand, if there were no attemptto make progress, he was sure that we should find ourselves in a very awkward position at the end of the war.     he agreed with the Prime Minister that the position was nowmuch better than it was a year ago.      On the other1 hand, he doubted whether it would be better a year hence;    and hethought that a genuine and sincere attempt at an advance would rally support from Indians.     All that he asked for at the moment was aiithority to take soundings on the lines proposed.     After taking these soundings he might -recommendmaking the approach;    or he might say that the chances ofsuccess were so small that nothing further should be done.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would not be infavour of the proposition - if put forward - that theViceroy should now make a definite statement that there could be no advance towards a settlement of theconstitutional question during the war.     Thus, it waspossible that circumstances might arise, say,  in a year&apos;s time, which would make it advisable to enter into negotiationsHe was bound to add, however, that he thought that any negotiations with Gandhi were fraught with great danger.    Hewould at once start up a controversy, and it was impossibleto reftise altogether to answer questions addressed to one by a man to whom one had made a definite proposal.      Gandhimight, for example, say that he was greatly in favour of much of the Viceroy&apos;s invitation but that he felt objectionto the over-riding powers of the Viceroy.The Prime Minister added that he regretted that theproposal put before the War Cabinet contained so littleabout progress on the social side.      He had hoped that this new and rather promising note might have been struck.w      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that most ofthe powers in economic matters were now in the hands of theProvinces and there was not very much which could be donefrom the centre.      While something could be done within limits, he believed that to put forward social changes as analternative to constitutional reforms would have a very bad effect upon public opinion in India.
9
THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that he thought, nevertheless, that some reference should be included in the Viceroy Designated statement to the Government1s intention to further economic progress and development in India.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that if an approach was made to Gandhi on the lines proposed,Gandhi would certainly not give a plain &apos;Yes&apos;  or &apos;No&apos;.The result would almost certainly be that we should getinvolved in negotiations with Gandhi which would landus in considerable difficulties.      The foreign secretary also thought that the last sentence ofAnnexure A was open to objection.THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION said thatif the Viceroy once started to make soundings, this fact would become known.     If, after he had takensoundings, nothing happened, it would inevitably besaid that the Viceroy and the Government of India hadbeen willing to make a new attempt to reach asettlement, but that the Government at home had been unwilling.     This would be very unfortunate, and theViceroy was therefore right in asking in advance whatthe views of the Cabinet were.THE PRIME MINISTER said he would favour astatement by the Viceroy, on arriving in India, onperhaps the following lines:-&quot;The pledges already given by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment stood.      He,  the Viceroy, had not come out from England to say that no progress would be made during the war.      On the otherhand, he must make it clear that his first duty was to make sure that India was a safebase for the great operations against Japanwhich were now pending, and that the war was pressed to a successful conclusion, and thatfamine and food difficulties were dealt with.To all these tasks he must now devote himself.&quot;The Prime Minister said that it would be agreat pity to do anything which would start up the oldpolitical agitation.     In particular, the proxjosal to start negotiations with Gandhi would lead to a first class political crisis in India,      This, moreover, was proposed at a time when Gandhi&apos;s stock and the stock of Congress had never stood lower.      The position might change and the time for negotiations might come, butfor the moment the first essential was that India shouldbe a tranquil and firm base for operations against JapanTHE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEthought that we should stand on the Cripps proposals.If Congress made any approach and made it clear thatthey were prepared to drop the civil disobedience movement, we should be prepared to do business with them.But he didn&apos;t like the proposal to make an offer which involved conditions which the Congress leaders would never accept.THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITYdoubted whether in existing circumstances it would be advantageous for the Viceroy to open up negotiations on the lines proposed.      On the other hand, it was clear that he must make some statement on arrival in

India.      He thought that the draft statement atAnnexure A would meat the position,  subject to thelast sentence being toned down to read as follows:-&quot;Attempts to make substantial progress towards this end during the war have so far failed, butI am of course free to examine whether a freshattempt would appear to have prospects ofsuccess.&quot;Having made this statement, the Viceroy could then waitand judge the situation as time went on, makingcautious, informal soundings of the Indians whom hewould meet from time to time.      If he thought that thetime was opportune for some further step, he would ofcourse report in this sense to the Government.     Thepresent proposal was, however,  in his view too rigidand formal.      He also attached great importance toan Indian policy including measures of economic and social reform.FIELD MARSHAL SMUTS said that he agreed that thelast sentence of Annexure A required amendment.      Hethought that the proposal now before the War cabinet was somewhat dangerous, since it contained conditionswhich Gandhi could not accept.      The approach was,therefore,  almost certain to fail;    and we should beasked why we had started negotiations which were boundto fail.      The first object of the Viceroy should be tomaintain the tranquility of the country,  so that our military effort could be prosecuted to the full extent.THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION said that there were30 American newspapermen at New Delhi and others werecorning out from the U.S.A.      If any meeting on thelines proposed was held,  it would obtain the maximumpublicity within a few hours of its being held.VISCOUNT HALIFAX said that the Viceroy Designatewas faced with a dilemma.      If he started negotiationswith prominent Indians who were at large, he would beasked why he had not also issue.ed an invitation to ghandi.      On the other hand, if he entered into negotiations with Gandhi, he would find himself facedwith formidable difficulties.      He therefore wondered whether it would not be possible to make it clear thatthe responsibility for opening up negotiations lay with the Congress leaders,  and that if at any time theydisavowed their former attitude, they would find that discussions with the Government were not barred.THE MINISTER OF PRODUCTION thought that no pro-gress could be made with negotiations when one of theprincipal parties was in prison.     He also thought there was not much use in starting negotiations on thebasis of conditions which the leaders of the indian political parties were unlikely to accept.     He there-fore came to the concision that the best course prob-ably was not to attempt/fresh negotiations for the timebeing. to start the LORD PRIVY SEAL thought it was generally accepted that it was unlikely that negotiations on thelines proposed would be successful.

At the same time the mere fact of starting negotiations would involve great risks.     A crisis would be worked up inIndia, in the United States and in this country, from whichserious consequences might follow.      He mentioned the serious political repercussions which the Montague-Ghelmsford dis-cussions had had on the Government during the last war.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said that the ViceroyDesignate had held high office in India during the last twoyears and therefore had much more recent experience than others taking part in the discussion.      Great weight should therefore be attached to his opinion.     He also feared that if no action was taken the position might deteriorate.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not by any meansentirely rule out the idea that further progress might bemade during the war.     He was, however, disappointed that the suggestions put forward took the form of resuscitation of thesame old political arguments with the same old political leaders.     He had hoped that new methods of approach to thesubject might be attempted.The Prime Minister said that he would like to suggestthat he should prepare an alternative draft to the Annexure:,.in the light of the discussion.      In this revised draft stresswould   be laid on the need for tranquility in India and for ensuring conditions which wo\xld facilitate the successful prosecution of the war.     At the same time it would be made clear that further progress on constitutional questions wasnot ruled out*The conclusions of the War Cabinet were as follows(l) While it was of course open to the Viceroy at anytime to submit recommendations to the War cabinet if he thought that the moment was opportune for taking some further step which would assist asoPution of the constitutional problem, it was doubtful whether any advantage was to be gained bylaying down at this stage too precise and definitea course of action before he had had a further opportunity of studying the political situation onihe spot and assessing the prospects of securingfmother progress.(2) It would be a mistake at this juncture to remove from the Congress leaders the onus of making adisavowal of their present attitude; moreover, asat present advised the War Cabinet were not pre-pared to embark on a policy of negotiations with gandhi, which in their view would be attended bygrave inconvenience.(3) The Prime Minister undertook to prepare a revised draft of the Annexures to W.P.(43)435 in the lightof the Discussions     These would be communicatedI to the Secretary of State for India and the ViceroyDesignate, and thereafter to the War Cabinet. Theycould, if necessary, he discussed at the Meeting ofthe War Cabinet on the following day.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.
