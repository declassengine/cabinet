Beaufighters had scored two torpedohits on a blockade runner off Lorient, which had been left listing.Fighter Command and Tactical Air Force, although restricted by weather conditions, had flown 1,220 sorties, mainly against&apos;&apos; Crossbow &apos;&apos; targets, without much success.Enemy activity had been slight, and confined to night operations.Allied activity had shown a slight drop on the previous week.Most of the sorties had been flown in support of the land battle.Shipping targets had been attacked in the Adriatic and onestrong attack made on the railway centre at Innsbruck.United States Liberators had attacked Balikpapen in borneo and Jaluit in the Marshalls, involving round trips in each case ofabout 2,600 miles.Shipping losses for the week by enemy action had been two ships, totalling 14,287 tons. Total losses for December so faramounted to 106,359 tons. A further convoy, consisting of 17 cargo ships and 2 tankers, was expected to arrive in North Russian portsthat day.   The voyage had been without incident.There had been no casualties so far this month from U-boats in the North Atlantic.The submarine which had sunk the two escorts of a convoy offthe North African coast, as reported the previous week, had itselfsubsequently been sunk. An American merchant ship, in convoy,had been torpedoed off Oran, the U-boat being subsequently sunk.Allied submarines had sunk an ammunition ship and a tankerin the Gulf of Genoa.In the Eighth Army Sector, there had been heavy fighting inwhich the enemy had lost heavily, and some progress had been made.On the Fifth Army front, the capture of San Pietro had completed the Allied occupation of the high ground on both sides ofthe Mignano gap.The general German offensive reported the previous week had now resolved itself into fighting in two main areas; in one of these the latest reports had shown that German offensive activity wasbeginning to peter out.United States forces had landed on the Arawe peninsula in new Britain on the morning of the 15th December. Enemyopposition had been slight.On the 19th December, the Russians announced a break-throughSouth of Nevel on a 50-mile front. The Russians had also capturedCherkasi, and had linked up their bridgehead there with the onesouth-west of Kremenchug. Elsewhere, they had maintained their pressure.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.[26626-1]

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave; the WarCabinet certain information about the position in these twocountries.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also gave the WarCabinet information about two discussions which he had had recently with representatives of the Polish Government, in regardto questions in dispute between Russia and Poland.The War Cabinet had a discussion as to our policy: in regardto Yugoslavia. . .   .The discussion and conclusions on these matters are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Shipping. 3.   The  War  Cabinet  considered  a memorandum by  theSupplies of Chairman of the Shipping Committee (W.P. (43) 570) raising thePhosphate Rockquestion whether a total of 318,000 tons of phosphate rock, allocated for Australia, by the Combined Food Board to Australia, New Zealand and SouthNew Zealand Africa, should be shipped by the end of March 1944 in addition toand South &apos; the existing programmes. Telegrams from the Prime Minister of africa. Australia and the Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand were setout in the Annex to the Memorandum.The Secretary, Department of Overseas Trade, explained that,so far as Australia and New Zealand were concerned, it was difficultto see how a drastic decrease in production could be avoided, at thevery time when demands for food might be at their peak, unless there were substantial imports of phosphates. Very considerabledemands were being made on these Dominions for food, not only forthis country, but also for the forces in the Pacific, and for reliefrequirements.The Combined Food Board had allocated 185,000 tons of rockto Australia and 96,000 tons to New Zealand; and in the view ofthe Shipping Committee there was a strong case for asking theAmerican authorities to provide ships to lift these supplies.Particulars given in paragraph 8 of the Memorandum showed thatthe United States authorities hoped to obtain very considerable quantities of food from Australia and New Zealand for consumption by their forces in that theatre, and they accordingly had a direct interest in maintaining food production there.The case for shipping, in full, the 37,000 tons of phosphate rockallocated to the Union of South Africa was not so urgent, and, since there were clearly not the same grounds for asking for UnitedStates assistance, the Shipping Committee assumed that, if this requirement was to be met, the rock must be carried in Britishtonnage. Shipment of additional phosphates to this area should,however, enable local production to be increased sufficiently to meetlocal demands which had increased through war-time conditions,and might also help to make available a surplus for export toneighbouring territories, in which, as experience had shown, foodshortages were liable to arise at short notice.The Minister of War Transport pointed out that, in the Cairodiscussions, the American authorities had been anxious that thereshould be a reduction in the shipping allocation to the Dominionsduring the first half of 1944. But he agreed that there was a strong case for urging the Americans to take steps to ensure that the food supply in Australia and New Zealand did not decline, and that special representations ought to be made to them on the specificpoint of providing shipping to carry the phosphates allocated by the combined authorities. If the approach failed, difficult problems would arise in considering whether our own shipping should be utilised; it would not be simply a matter of yielding up for thispurpose part of the total United Kingdom 1944 import programmeprovisionally put at 26 million tons.
Mr. Bruce reminded the War Cabinet that the questions at issuefar transcended the immediate interests of Australia and NewZealand. It was clear that, if substantial amounts of phosphatescould not be made available, the Dominions could not hope to meetthe food requirements of the United Nations.The conclusions of the War Cabinet were as follows : (1) The American authorities should be asked to provide vessels to ship, by the end of March 1944, phosphate rock to atotal of 281,000 tons to Australia and New Zealand.The Minister of War Transport was invited to take thismatter up with the American authorities immediately,on the basis that a failure to import fertilisers of theamounts suggested could not fail to be reflected in thesupplies of food available from Australia and NewZealand for the United Nations.(2) A decision was deferred, until the outcome of these negotia-tions was known, on the questions 1(i) whether this total, or any part of it, should be shipped in British tonnage if American assistance was not forthcoming; and(ii) whether British tonnage should be used to ship the37,000 tons of phosphate rock allocated to theUnion of South Africa, or any lesser quantity, bythe end of March 1944.(3) Pending the outcome of these negotiations, which would be handled as a matter of great urgency, no arrangements should be made by the Minister of War Transport forthe shipment of phosphate rock to Australia, NewZealand or South Africa.Middle East 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the cereal Prices.   Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (43) 572).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that cereal prices in theMiddle East (and particularly in Syria) were now many times above pre-war-war levels, and were greatly in excess of current prices ofcereals imported to Egypt from Canada or Australia. In 1941 and1942 the high price of cereals in the Middle East had beenaccentuated by hoarding, due partly to the nearness of the battle-front. There was now a surplus of about half a million tons ofvarious cereals in the area, and the war was further removed.Notwithstanding this, the Minister of State Resident in the middle east asserted that, unless we paid the unduly high, and rising,prices now asked, there was a risk that we should lose some of the grain altogether.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his view, an effort must be made to break the spiral of rising prices. Otherwise weshould be asked to pay still higher prices in the following year.. he accordingly suggested that a telegram should be sent to the Ministerof State Resident in the Middle East to the effect that the time had now come when we should take the definite line that we expected, areduction in the prices of cereals.So far as Iraq was concerned, a line of policy had been agreed,which it was thought would satisfy the Minister of State resident in the Middle East and would result in a reduction in. prices. Inregard to Syria, the Chancellor of the Exchequer recommended thatwe should approach the French and see whether they would let us have the surplus of Syrian cereals now, provided we undertook toreplace an equal tonnage to Metropolitan France without charge inthe relief period.The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that he had discussed the matter with the representatives of the United KingdomCommercial Corporation, who were confident that they could obtain
some small reduction in prices and that this would not, in the longrun, involve our failing to secure from the Middle East any of the cereals which we should otherwise hope to obtain.The Minister of War Transport said that while he was inEgypt he had had discussions on this matter with the Minister ofState and with officials of the Middle East Supply Centre,including the representatives of the Centre in Syria. They hadtaken the view that, if we did not pay the prices now asked, weshould not obtain the quantities of cereals which we required and hoped to purchase. Moreover, it had been represented that a tentative agreement had been entered into to pay the prices nowproposed for this year&apos;s crop; and that if, after efforts had beenmade to stimulate production, the prices for this year&apos;s crop were reduced, this would have very unfortunate results. It was thereforeargued that a reduction of prices should only apply to nextyear&apos;s crop.The Minister of War Transport also said that it was perhapssignificant that, while these discussions were proceeding, the french authorities in Syria had purchased some wheat and shipped it to north Africa. He thought that, if we stood aside, the French wouldpurchase some of the surplus for their own purposes, and a gooddeal of the remainder would be hoarded. He reminded hiscolleagues that any failure to obtain the full surplus would resultin further demands on shipping, which we could ill afford.There was general agreement with the view expressed in discussion by the Lord Privy Seal and the Paymaster-General thatthe prices asked for could not be justified and that it was important to take all practical steps to effect a reduction. .Reference was also made to the proposal that we should pay a15 per cent. Sales Tax to the Syrian Government, and it was agreed(hat this should be strongly resisted.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theForeign Office did not favour the Chancellors proposal that weshould approach the French, which, he thought, would lead tofurther delay.The general view of the War Cabinet was that it would be preferable that this matter should be settled during Mr. Casey&apos;forthcoming visit to this country, more particularly as full infor-tnation was not available on certain points. The short- delay involved would not prejudice the position, more especially seeing thatprovisional instructions had already been sent to the minister resident.The War Cabinet accordingly deferred a decision, untilMr. Casey reached this country, on the issues set out in theChancellor of the Exchequers Memorandum. TheChancellor of the Exchequer was invited to include, inthe telegram to Mr. Casey informing him of this decision,a paragraph asking for further intormation to elucidatethe point whether a tentative agreement had been reached as to the prices for this year&apos;s crop.Parliament.SlaetoralUwform andof&quot; vSoscs.(Previous-refers-euee:WJML (48) 188felMinute 8.)5. At their meeting on the 11th October, the War Cabinet had agreed that a two days&apos; Debate on the electoral system should beheld on a Motion for the appointment of a Speakers Conference toconsider questions of electoral reform, and that the Motion for theappointment of the Conference should include a. list of the questionswhich it was to consider.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (43) 568)suggesting some modification of the procedure then agreed.Th&amp; Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security explainedthat, when Speakers&quot; Conferences on electoral reform had been setup in 1916 and 1930, the Prime Minister bad written a letter to the speaker inviting him to preside over a Conference, and the reports
of the Conferences had been made in the form of a letter from the speaker to the Prime Minister.He assumed that the same procedure would be followed on thepresent occasion.On the earlier occasions it had been left to the Speaker to choose the members of the Conference, and on each occasion Peers hadbeen included.He assumed that this precedent would also be followed on thepresent occasion.The Prime Minister had already announced that a two days&apos;Debate would be held. The Home Secretary and Minister of home security now proposed that the Debate should take place on aresolution, submitted by the Government, welcoming the proposal that there should be a conference on electoral reform: and redistribution-tion of seats to be presided over by Mr. Speaker. It would thenbe for the Government spokesman to announce, in his opening speech, the list of subjects which it was proposed that theConference should consider, instead of including them, as had previously been proposed, in a Motion for the appointment of theConference.  This was agreed to.At their earlier meeting, the War Cabinet had left for laterdecision what attitude the Government should take in the event ofan amendment being put down to preclude the Conference fromconsidering proportional representation. The Home Secretary and minister of Home Security now considered that it would be wrong to accept any amendment designed to narrow the scope of the agendaor limit the discretion left by that agenda to the Conference, and suggested that any amendments to the proposed resolution should be resisted by the Government, and that, if necessary, the GovernmentWhips should be put on.This was generally agreed.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security added thatthere.was considerable pressure for legislation with regard toredistribution, and it would also be desirable for a. report on thelocal government franchise to be available well before the expiration of the Local Election (Temporary Provisions) Act. He accordingly suggested that the Conference should be invited to submit early-reports on these two subjects.It was pointed out that a complication which might delay theConference in producing an interim report on the question of redistribution was that any recommendations on this subject mightbe affected by their consideration of proportional representation.Members of Parliament could not, however, reasonably object atdelay for this reason. It was generally agreed that it would bedesirable to ask the Conference, if practicable, to present separateinterim reports on redistribution and the local government franchisewithout waiting until they had concluded their deliberations onall the items in their programme.The War Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations contained in W.P. (43) 568,and summarised above.(2) Took note that the two days&apos; Debate on electoral reformwould probably be held during the second wreek afterParliaments reassembly.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,20th December, 1943.
