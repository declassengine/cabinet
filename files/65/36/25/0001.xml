The Lebanon. The War Cabinet gave further consideration to the position(Previous in the Lebanon, in the light of the latest telegrams from his reference: Majesty&apos;s Minister in Beirut and the Minister of State ResidentW.M.(43)156th in the Middle East.Conclusions, In particular, attention  was  drawn  to  a  telegram  fromMinute 3). Mr. Casey, dated the 17th November (No. OZ 36720), which contained the following sentence : &quot; In my discussions with Catrouxhere I have assumed that release of Lebanese Ministers meant their release as Ministers, i.e., that reinstatement of Ministers was a corollary of their release and I consistently spoke to him in this sense.&quot; - the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thedemands which we had made of the French National Committeehad been limited to the recall of M. Helleu and the release of theMinisters, and had not included a demand for their immediatereinstatement.Our plan had been that, after the Ministers had been released,the Minister of0State Resident in the Middle East should bring theFrench Authorities and the Ministers together with the object of reaching a settlement of the constitutional issues. To insist,however, on the full and immediate restoration of the LebaneseMinisters was open to objection on two grounds. First, that it wouldmake it almost impossible for the French to meet our demands and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs emphasised that hewas anxious to reach a settlement, if possible. Second, that if theLebanese Ministers, on release, immediately resumed their functions,this was likely to result in continued deadlock between the ministers and the French Authorities.&quot; The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read out to the WarCabinet a draft telegram to the Minister of State Resident in theMiddle East, on the above lines.The following were the main points made in discussion : (1) As the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East hadalready made it clear to General Catroux that the release of theMinisters, implied their reinstatement, we could not afford to recedefrom this position.(2) The imprisoned Ministers were still, in our view, the de jureGovernment of the Lebanon; and on release would revert to their former status of Ministers. It should be in their capacity as ministers constituting the rightful Government of Lebanon that,when released, they should enter into discussions with the french authorities.(3) The object of the negotiations to be undertaken byMr. Casey and Sir Edward Spears should be to bring the two sidestogether and to arrange a settlement of the matters in dispute.(4) In order to limit the risks of further conflict, it might bepossible.to ensure that during the period of the negotiations neitherparty should take action to vary the position, and the LebaneseParliament should not meet.(5) In this connection it must be remembered that the LebaneseGovernment were not without blame, and that if the French had not taken such precipitate and unjustified action, we might well have thought it right to support the French against the attitude adopted        ,by the Lebanese. A(6) Reference was made to the position of Emir Edde, who hadbeen appointed as head of the State and head of the Government bya decree of M. Helleu. It was clear that we could not recogniseEmir Edde.Reference was then made to the question of the time limit. as there might be some doubt as to the exact request which we would put to the French, and as General Catroux might have to refer toAlgiers, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought thatour time limit should be extended by 24 hours.  This was agreed to.
The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister of Aircraft Production,&quot;to redraft the draft telegram to the Minister of StateResident in the Middle East, in the light of the points made in discussion. In particular, it should be made clear that the Ministers, when released, would revert totheir former status. The telegram, as redrafted, shouldbe despatched forthwith, without further reference tothe War Cabinet.(2) A telegram should also be despatched extending the time limit by 24 hours, so as to expire on Monday, the22nd November.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,18th November, 1943.
