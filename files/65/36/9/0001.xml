Post-War 1,   At their meeting on the 15th April-the War Cabinet hadAgricultural considered proposals for a post-war agricultural policy (W.P.

(43) 432: by the Minister of Food, suggesting that immediate discussions on long-term policy might prove embarrassing, and that for the present it would be sufficientto give the farmers a specific assurance that the present systemof fixed prices and a guaranteed market would be continued until the end of 1947.W.P. (43) 455 : by the Minister of Agriculture and. Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland proposing,... with the support of the Lord Presidents Committee, that thereshould be no general increase in agricultural prices on accountof the current increase in labour costs; but that in the courseof the forthcoming negotiations regarding changes in the pricesof particular commodities the farmers should be assured thatthe present system of fixed prices and guaranteed markets willbe continued for a period including the harvest of 1947.The first point dealt with by the War Cabinet in discussion wasthe need for entering into discussions with the agricultural industryin the near future.(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the decision reached in the Lord Presidents Committee that theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretaryof State for Scotland should make it clear to theagricultural industry that there should be no rise in agricultural prices to compensate for the recent andforthcoming increases in agricultural wages, resulting&quot;&apos; from decisions of the Agricultural Wages Board.   TheAgricultural Ministers&apos; task in obtaining acceptance ofthis decision and of certain important variations in thecost of particular agricultural commodities, within thepresent general level of agricultural prices, would be greatly eased if Ministers were authorised to enter into discussions with the industry about the general principles on which post-war agricultural policy would,, be based.(b) The War Cabinet were also reminded that a government spokesman had stated in Parliament in December 1942that the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland hoped to be in a position,early in the New Year, to embark on preliminary discussions with the industry. (Parliamentary Debates,Fifth Series, Volume 385, Col. 1095.)(c) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that therewere a number of specific questions on which it wasnecessary to start discussions.   He gave as examplestenancy agreements which had been upset by warv ... conditions;  and the methods to be adopted to reducethe acreage for certain crops (e.g., wheat and barley)below the present high levels. He had reached a stageat which he could not make any further progress without having discussions with the industry.

The first was the future ofthe County War Agricultural Executive Committees.Hitherto, the members of these Committees had given their time on a voluntary basis. The present position could not continue indefinitely, and the whole scheme forthe future control and regulation of the farming industry would have to be discussed. The second point related to efficient marketing arrangements, by which consider-able sums of money could be saved.(e) It was urged that the present atmosphere in the farming industry was favourable to discussions. On the otherhand, if the opening of discussions was still furtherdelayed, the atmosphere would deteriorate, more particu-larly once the price negotiations referred to in (a) abovehad been started.(/) The Minister of Food said that it would be in our interests to place a certain number of long-term contracts withthe Dominions and overseas countries for food products.He thought it would be politically impossible for these contracts to be entered into, unless the farming industry were given some assurance of the continuance, for an appreciable period, of the present system of guaranteed prices. This, of course, did not mean an assurance ofthe continuance of prices at the existing level.The War Cabinet reached the conclusion that the agricultural ministers should be authorised to open discussions with the industryin the near future.Discussion then turned on the nature and scope of thediscussions.(g) Would the discussions involve any financial commitment ?The Minister of A gricullure and Fisheries said that, as stated in his memorandum, the discussions would be entirely of an exploratory character and the War cabinet would not be committed thereby. The discussions wouldtake a very long time and might even last for a year oreighteen months.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that hissupport of the proposal that negotiations should now be started was on the basis that there would be no commit-ment without prior reference to the Cabinet.(h) A number of Ministers said that, once negotiations had started, the farmers would demand subsidies and itwould be difficult to avoid entering into some impliedcommitment.On the other hand, the view was expressed that theincrease in productivity due to the mechanisation of farming ought to make it possible for the farming industry to pay its way.(j) The Minister of Food in his Memorandum had proposedthat the present system of fixed prices should be extendedup to and including the harvest of 1947.The Prime Minister said that he was in full agree-ment with the view that, in agricultural policy as inother fields, there would have to be a transitional period after the war before normal conditions&apos; were resumed.He thought, however, that it would suffice if the transitional period was taken as a period of two yearsafter the end of the war with Germany.

The discussions wouldtake a very long time and might even last for a year oreighteen months.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that hissupport of the proposal that negotiations should now be started was on the basis that there would be no commit-ment without prior reference to the Cabinet.(h) A number of Ministers said that, once negotiations had started, the farmers would demand subsidies and itwould be difficult to avoid entering into some impliedcommitment.On the other hand, the view was expressed that theincrease in productivity due to the mechanisation of farming ought to make it possible for the farming industry to pay its way.(j) The Minister of Food in his Memorandum had proposedthat the present system of fixed prices should be extendedup to and including the harvest of 1947.The Prime Minister said that he was in full agree-ment with the view that, in agricultural policy as inother fields, there would have to be a transitional period after the war before normal conditions&apos; were resumed.He thought, however, that it would suffice if the transitional period was taken as a period of two yearsafter the end of the war with Germany. This wouldgive time for post-war policies to be worked out in the
light of conditions which could not now be foreseen. he also thought that any longer period would give rise toembarrassing demands from other industries.(&amp;) This led to a general discussion as to whether, in fact, the transitional period could be dealt with in isolation from what was to come after it, and whether the negotiations on the transitional period would not provide a helpfulopportunity for discussions with the industry on thelong-term policy. The general view of the War cabinet favoured this latter course.Other points raised in discussion: (1) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat, whilst as Minister responsible for agriculture inNorthern Ireland he was associated with W.P. (43) 422,he could not claim to speak with any special knowledgeor responsibility for agriculture. He thought that itwould be helpful, in denning our future agricultural policy, if the Minister of Food could give a target for milk consumption after the war, and could also reporton the nutritional aspects of agriculture and on theproblems of distribution.(m) The Secretary of State for Air attached great importanceto small holdings, for which there would be a greatdemand after the war, certainly in Scotland, andprobably also in England and Wales. This was an issue which he thought ought to be dealt with at once.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said thathe was not in agreement with the views expressed by theSecretary of State for Air, but that this matter was not within the scope of the Memorandum which he had submitted to the War Cabinet.(n) The Secretary of State for Air referred to the considera-tions in paragraphs 16 and 17 of his Memorandum asto the importance of maintaining in peace a volume ofbulky imports which could be dispensed with in time ofwar, and thus provided a shipping reserve for war purposes. From this point of view imported animal feeding-stuffs were important.(o) The Lord Privy Seal said that^he thought that even withthe recent increase, agricultural wages were if anythingrather on the low side as compared with certain other classes of wage earners.From the point of view of the post-war position, themost important factors were marketing, transport anddistribution. These, however, were not matters whichcould be settled by the farming community, at any ratein isolation.The general conclusion of the War Cabinet was that theAgricultural Ministers should now be authorised to open upnegotiations with the farming industry; that they should beempowered, in the course of these negotiations, to give a firm under-taking that the present system of fixed prices and guaranteedmarkets for British agriculture would be continued for a period ofnot less than two years after the end of the war with Germany; andthat the discussions need not be limited to this transitional period,but might extend to cover questions of long-term policy, subject-to the clear understanding that no commitments would be enteredinto, without further reference to the War Cabinet, in respect ofany period beyond the two years after the end of the war.
The War Cabinet--Appointed a Committee consisting of the Lord President of the Council (Chairman),the Lord Privy Seal,the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, andthe Paymaster-General,to draw up, in the light of the discussion, the terms of adraft Directive to guide the Agricultural Ministers intheir forthcoming discussions with the. representatives ofthe industry; this draft Directive to be submitted to theWar Cabinet for their approval.2. The War Cabinet considered Memoranda by the Secretaryof State for War (W.P. (43) 429) and by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries (W.P. (43) 431) regarding a request by the american forces for the use of certain specified areas in Southern Commandby the five United States armoured divisions which would be located in that Command by the end of April 1944.It was explained in the Memoranda that the area involvedamounted to some 141,000 acres of highly productive agricultural land. Although it was proposed to proceed under Defence Regula-tion 52, with the result that the farmers, would not be whollydispossessed of their land, there was no doubt that there would be substantial interference with farming operations and a great lossof food production.The Secretary of State for War explained that every possibilityof providing the training facilities required in areas where lessinterference with food production would be involved had beenexplored without success. Moreover, the original demands of theAmerican Forces had been subjected to close scrutiny, as a result,of which they had been reduced by about 25 per cent. While, there-fore, he regretted the disturbance involved to agriculture, he was satisfied that there was no practicable alternative. If the proposal were approved in principle, the greatest care would be taken, inaccordance . with the procedure of interdepartmental discussion which was normally followed in these cases, to see that the interestsof agriculture were protected so far as practicable. In particular,steps would be taken to secure that the land was made available only as and when the American Forces were ready to make practical useof it.The War Cabinet-Agreed in principle that these areas must be made avail-able to the American Forces for training purposes; and asked that the detailed arrangements should be finally settled in consultation between the War Office and theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,lbth October, 1943.
