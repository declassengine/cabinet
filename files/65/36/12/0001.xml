107W.M. 144(43).        71Reconstruction 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the plans. Prime Minister (W.P. (43) 467) suggesting certain broad principles(Previous which should guide His Majesty&apos;s Government in their approachReference: to post-war problems; and a Memorandum by the Paymaster -W.M. (43) 140th General (W.P. (43) 465) analysing in greater detail the categoriesConclusions.)     into which the various reconstruction projects could be groupedaccording to the urgency with which completed plans would berequired after the war.The Prime Minister said that the war with Germany mightwell continue for a substantial time; but His Majesty&apos;s government ought nevertheless to be ready to meet the contingency of a suddencollapse of Germany. They would be failing in their duty as a warGovernment if an unexpected collapse on the part of the enemyfound them unprepared for the problems which would ariseimmediately upon the cessation of hostilities in Europe. much time could be spent in discussing long-term schemes for building anew world order; but the first task was to make all necessary preparations for the period of Transition which would lie betweenthe two stages of War and settled Peace. He had listed inparagraph 1 of his Memorandum the most important of the problemsof Transition, viz., demobilisation, food, employment, the resump-tion of the export trade and the restoration of our mercantilemarine, and the general turnover of industry from war to peace.The supreme objectives must be to assure food and employment inthe transitional period; and any decisions needed for this purposemust be taken now, whether or not they involved legislation andwhether or not they were controversial.Consideration of the long-term problems must be postponed until plans for the transitional period had been completed; andmost of these long-term problems could best be left over for studyin the period of transition, possibly after a General Election hadbeen held. There were, however, a number of matters, e.g., educa-tion, social insurance and the rebuilding of bombed cities, on whichit should be possible to find a wide measure of general agreement.Plans for dealing with these matters roust be brought to a high degree of preparation during the war, any necessary preliminarylegislation being passed, so that they would be ready to come intoforce in the early days of the transition period.The Prime Minister suggested that it would be safe, as a working basis, to take the transition period as two years after the defeat of Germany, or four years from the 1st January, 1944,whichever period shall end the sooner.The War Cabinet expressed their general agreement with theline of approach suggested by the Prime Minister.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe would like to submit for consideration two developments of thePrime Minister&apos;s scheme :  (a) While he agreed with the g 61161&apos;cl 1 proposition that in war we should plan for the transition and in the transitionshould plan for peace,&quot;he hoped that this would not rule out the possibility of considering at an early stage such the long-term plans as were relevant to a solution ofthe transitional problems, some of which, indeed, couldnot be satisfactorily solved unless we kept an eye on thelong-term objective.(b) He also hoped that, in considering the provision of employ-ment in the transitional period, we should not be precluded from considering such changes in the organi-sation of particular industries as would increase their- efficiency and thus enable them to provide fuller and&apos;more continuous opportunities of employment.The Home Secretary -and Minister of Home Security said thathe would like the Prime Minister to consider certain suggestions,which he would send to him, for modifying some passages in his memorandum in order to meet these two points.[26291] B 9
In the course of further discussion the following were amongthe main points raised : (i) Reference was made to the appreciation which the Ministerof Production had asked the Chiefs of Staff to prepare showing thestrength of the Armed Forces required after Germany had been defeated, but while the war continued against Japan, and the equipment and munitions which would be required during thisperiod.. The Minister of Production said that considerable progress had been made in preparing estimates.The view was, however, expressed that these preliminaryestimates were on the high side. Further, in order to work out theproduction plans, it would be necessary to have some workingassumption regarding the probable duration of the war&apos; against japan.The Prime Minister said he would consider whether he couldprepare a directive setting out a working hypothesis on which departments could act in this matter.(ii) The Prime Minister said that, in order to expedite theturnover of industry from war to peace, detailed plans should, be worked out as soon as possible for switching over to peace-time work  the factories which had been diverted to war production.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was handi-capped in his study of this problem by the fact that the supply departments could not yet say with any precision which of the factories working on their programmes could be released for peace-time work at various stages after the end of hostilities in Europe.The Minister of Aircraft Production explained that it wasimpossible for the Supply Ministers to make detailed plans on theselines until they knew what the scale and content of the munitions programme would be after the end of the war with Germany. Ifthey could be given working assumptions about munitions produc-tion for the war against Japan, as suggested above, they would do their best to make detailed plans showing the stages at whichparticular war factories might be released for peace-time production. . &apos;Reference was also made to the length of time for which warfactories might have to stand idle while they were being re-tooledfor peace-time production. It would help to reduce unemploymentduring this period if the allocation of war orders could be so arranged that one factory was fully occupied with munitions production while a neighbouring factory was wholly freed forre-tooling.(iii) One of- the immediate objectives listed in the PrimeMinister.&apos;s Memorandum was the resumption of the export trade.It was important to keep this in mind in regulating our supplies ofraw materials. It was not too early to begin to consider how far wecould build up, without prejudice to the present needs of war production, stocks of the raw materials which would be requiredby the export trades immediately after the end of the war.Some of the equipment of the export trades also neededmodernisation. As soon as capacity became available, it would bedesirable to put in hand the production of the new machinery most urgently required.(iv) The Minister of Labour and National Service said that, if his Department was to be responsible for the resettlement andplacing in employment of men discharged from the Forces, an early decision to this effect should be reached, so that plans could be madeto turn over to this work the organisation now engaged inmobilising man-power for war purposes.The view was expressed that the Ministry of Labour and national Service should undertake these duties.
Migration. (v) The Secretary of. State for Dominion Affairs said that,whereas before the war the Dominions had not taken a very great interest in Empire migration, several Dominions were now preparedto receive a substantial number of migrants from this country afterthe War and were showing much greater interest in this matter. Hethought that we could count upon a considerable flow of migrationto the Dominions in the early years after the war.In this connection it was pointed out that it would be a great mistake to treat migration as though it were a cure for unemploy-ment, and to defer making plans for migration until there was a threat of unemployment. It was also pointed out that the present -and prospective trends of population and age distribution in this. country might call for a different attitude towards migration tothat which had obtained in the past.Food and Relief. (vi) The Minister of State referred to paragraph 1 (b) of thePrime Ministers Memorandum, which spoke of &quot; the provision offood for our Island on a scale better than war-time rations.&quot; as there would certainly be serious shortages of food in Europe afterthe war, it would be politically undesirable that any public state-ment should be made which implied that we were looking forward to an increase in our scale of rations after the war. The sameobjections would not, of course, apply to steps directed to improving the variety of our diet.The view was also expressed that, when the time came, theconditions of shortage in the liberated areas of Europe would lead the people of this country of their own accord to be willing to makesacrifices. .Housing and (vii) The importance was also stressed of having sufficientFurniture. housing accommodation available for ex-Servicemen who wished tomarry and settle down after the war. This might involve some provision of temporary housing. There must also be good suppliesof well-designed furniture.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) General agreement was expressed with the broad line of approach to the post-war problems set out in the PrimeMinister&apos;s Memorandum. The Prime Minister under-took to prepare a further note in the course of the nextfew days, in which he would deal with various questionsof organisation and procedure, with a view to ensuring the completion by Departments of preparations for the transition period. In this note he would take intoaccount the points raised in discussion.(2) Departments would be called upon to submit schedulesshowing (i)&apos; The schemes for which they were responsible andwhich must be ready (a) on the day that hostilities with Germany end;(5) within, say, six months of that date.(ii) The state of preparedness of those schemes,e.g., those ready now and those which would beready within three or six months,(iii) The action needed to complete these schemes, ordecisions on points of principle called for beforefurther work could be carried out,(3) Detailed instructions would be issued shortly to Depart-ments showing how effect could best be given to the- preceding conclusion in order to avoid duplication ofwork already in hand.
Social Services.UnemploymentInsurance.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 29thConclusions.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (43) 466) regarding the needfor action before the end of the war to meet an increase inlocalised unemployment resulting from changes in the balance ofour production programmes, and a substantial, though probablytemporary, increase in the general volume of unemployment at thebeginning of the demobilisation period after the war. Theexperience of the last war had shown the importance of preparing for this situation in advance; and the Lord Presidents Committee,who had considered certain proposals put before them by theMinister of Labour and National Service, were satisfied that itwould not be possible to postpone until after the war the changesin the present scheme of unemployment insurance which would berequired to meet this situation. They considered, however, that itwould be inexpedient that such changes should be proposed toParliament before the Government had presented their promisedWhite Paper on their provisional proposals for a comprehensive scheme of social insurance.It was therefore recommended in the Memorandum that thepreparation of this White Paper should be expedited; and that,when the views of Parliament had been obtained by Debate on theWhite Paper, the Government should then decide whether certain parts of the new scheme of social insurance ought to be brought intoforce before the end of the war or, alternatively, whether changesin one or more of the separate existing schemes should be made, asan emergency measure to deal with the conditions likely to arisebefore the introduction of the comprehensive scheme. It was recom-mended that in either event the rate of unemployment benefit should. at that stage be raised to the level decided upon for the comprehensive-sive scheme, and that the period of unemployment benefit shouldbe the same as it would be under that scheme.The War Cabinet   -Approved the recommendations made in W.P. (43) 466.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W..1,21st October, 1943.
