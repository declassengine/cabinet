The War Cabinet had a discussion on Future operations which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Ireland.- (previous reference:W.M. (43) 130thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The War Cabinet resumed their discussion of president roosevelt&apos;s proposal to send a communication to Mr. de Valeraregarding the continued neutrality of Eire. They had before themthree Memoranda on this subject by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs (W.P. (43) 456, 500 and 501).The discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.East Africa.CompulsoryLabour forCivilianPurposes.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 129thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. At an earlier discussion on the 20th September the WarCabinet had taken the view that it would, not be practicable inpresent circumstances to discontinue entirely the system of com-pulsory recruitment of civilian labour in East Africa for essential war work.The War Cabinet now had before them a further Memorandumon this question (W.P. (43) 488) in which the Secretary of State forthe Colonies said that, from what he had seen during his recent visit to East Africa, he had no doubt that this system must be continuedif essential production was to be maintained. He wished, however,to draw attention to two points : &apos;(i) In their earlier discussion the War Cabinet had contem-plated that this system would be used only for theproduction of sisal and pyrethrum. It was likely,however, that it would also have to be used for theproduction of essential foodstuffs, and possibly of other commodities. The Secretary of State proposed to givethe necessary authority, when required, on the applica-tion of the Governors after consultation with theDepartments most closely concerned,(ii) In the sisal industry the authority previously given by theWar Cabinet had been for employment for a period of six months only. The Secretary of State said that, after examination on the spot, he was satisfied that so short a time-limit would be impracticable, particularly in viewof the long distances which recruits might have to travel.He had therefore authorised the Governor to recruitthis labour for a maximum period of twelve months.The Secretary of State added that he was proposing to send out a competent investigator to report on what, if any, further improvements in the conditions of employment are immediatelypracticable. This investigator would at the same time be able toascertain whether anything further was possible as regards intro-ducing safeguards against the exploitation of compulsory labour for private profit. The Secretary of State pointed out, however, thatthe field for further control in East Africa was a restricted one.The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the action taken by the Secretary of State for theColonies in authorising the Governor of Tanganyika toarrange for the compulsory recruitment of 11,000 mento be employed in the sisal industry for a maximum period of twelve months.(2) Approved the general policy outlined in W.P. (43) 488.[26369-3]
4. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretaryof the War Cabinet (W.P. (43) 492) covering the Report of theCommittee appointed by the Prime Minister to enquire intoconditions in Naval and Military Prisons and Detention Barracks.This Note pointed out that the Report as printed did not contain the full statement of the evidence taken at the detentionbarracks themselves, and raised the question whether this evidenceshould be published, in addition to the summary of complaintsheard in London.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Agreed that the statement of evidence taken at the detention barracks themselves should be printed as partof the Report.(2) Took note that the Report would be presented to parliament and published during the Parliamentary Recess.5. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (W.P. (43) 457), the Chancellor of theExchequer (W.P. (43) 499) and the Minister of Pensions(W.P. (43) 483) regarding (i) the pensions payable to the widows of retired officers who lose their lives while undertaking furtherservice in a lower&apos; rank during the war, and (ii) the gratuitiespayable to the widows of officers killed in action.In the course of a short discussion, the Prime Minister saidthat he was most concerned with the case of widows of retiredFlag Officers who lost their lives while serving as Commodores of convoy. It seemed inequitable that in such cases the widow shouldsuffer financially from her husband&apos;s action in volunteering forfurther service in a lower rank. It would be possible to make anactuarial computation, on the basis of the officer&apos;s normal expecta-tion of life if he had not volunteered for further service, of theincome which she would have shared with her husband if he had continued in retirement drawing his pension as a Flag Officer.Would it not be possible to arrange that the widow should beentitled to draw either this amount, or the pension payable in respectof the lower rank in which the officer was serving at the time of his death, whichever was the greater?It was suggested that, if this basis were adopted, the pensionmight in some cases be higher than that payable to the widow of aFlag Officer who died while serving in that rank.The War Cabinet Appointed a Committee consisting of The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),The Minister of Production,The Minister of Aircraft Production,to consider the views of the Service Ministers and theMinister of Pensions and to make recommendations to theWar Cabinet on the questions raised in these Memoranda.6. The War Cabinet were informed that the Duke ofMontrose was to raise in the House of Lords on the 9th november the question whether official recognition of Service cadet organisa-tions would be continued after the war.tThe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that the answer might be given that policy with regard to youth movementsafter the war was to be considered in connection with the draftEducation Bill, and that the Service cadets could not properly beconsidered apart from youth movements generally. On the otherhand, the Secretary of State for Air had already announced in theHouse of Commons on the 14th April, 1943, that the government intended to maintain the Air Training Corps after the war; and asimilar announcement had recently been made by the First Lord of
Parliament. 7.   The Home Secretary and Minister of Home SecurityParliament recalled that, in accordance with the recommendations of the(Elections and Departmental Committee on Electoral Machinery, this Bill providedMeeting) Bill. that a claim to be placed on the business premises register must bemade by the individual claimant. (The reason for this was that under war-time conditions it would be administratively impracticable-able to compile the business premises register unless the onus was placed on the individual to claim that his name should be enteredin the register.) The Bill was now in Committee stage in the Houseof Commons; and on the previous day a number of ConservativeMembers had moved an amendment having , the effect that anyperson would be entitled to apply on the claimants behalf. On a division this amendment had been defeated by a small majority.Notice had now been given that on the following day anotheramendment would be moved which would put an obligation onInspectors of Taxes to send out notices with a view to the compila-tion of the business premises register. The scheme outlined in this amendment was quite impracticable, but the amendment was likelyto be pressed to a division.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe point of principle raised by this new amendment was the sameas that rejected on the previous day, and he recommended that this new amendment should also be resisted.The War Cabinet-Agreed that this amendment should be resisted.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,4th November, 1943.the Admiralty with regard to the Sea Cadets. If these twoannouncements were endorsed by the War Cabinet, the War office would wish that a similar announcement should be made in respectof the Army Cadets; and it would be desirable that such anannouncement should be made in the forthcoming Debate in theHouse of Lords.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to announce in the forthcoming Debate in the House of Lordsthat it was the present intention of the Government tocontinue after the war the cadet organisations of each ofthe three Services. He would, of course, take care to avoidbeing drawn into making any statement on the questionwhether compulsory military service would be maintainedafter the war.
