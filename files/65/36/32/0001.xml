The &quot;War Cabinet had before them the following papers : (i) Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService on the available man-power in 1944 (W.P.(43) 472).(ii) Memorandum by the Prime Minister on the assumptionson which the man-power policy for 1944 should be framed (W.P. (43) 490).(iii) Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, givingthe scheme of allocation for 1944, proposed by the ministerial Committee on Man-Power (W.P. (43) 539).(iv) Memoranda by the Secretary of State for Air on man-power for the RAP. in 1944 (W.P. (43) 425 and 546).(v) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War on man-power requirements of the Army in 1944 (W.P. (43) 464).(vi) Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty on man-power for the Navy in 1944 (W.P. (43) 534).(vii) Note by the Minister of Aircraft Production on man-power for the aircraft programme (W.P. (43) 545).(viii) Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty on man-power requirements for the Navy and Admiraltyindustries for 1944 (W.P. (43) 448).(ix) Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome   Security   on   Civil   Defence   and  man-power(W.P. (43) 535).(x) Memoranda by the Minister of Health and the Secretaryof State for Scotland on building labour for housingwork (W.P. (43) 489 and 497).The War Cabinet proceeded to discuss the points arising asregards the Services, the Supply Departments, Civil Defence,Building Labour and Groups II and III Industries.Royal Navy. (a) The pirst Lord of the Admiralty referred to the suggestion made by the Prime Minister in his telegram Frozen 545, that theadditional 17,000 men required by the Navy should be found bycombing out naval strength. He thought that this suggestion musthave been made in the absence of knowledge of the drasticeconomies which were already being applied and without which amuch larger intake would have been necessary. For example,11.000 men were being found by reducing shore bases, 11,000 byabolishing the Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation, and 14,000by laying up the warships detailed in his Memorandum. TheAdmiralty would, of course, do everything in their power to carryout the tasks asked of the Royal Navy with the resources allotted.But he must point out that, if the intake were confined to 50,000 menirrespective of the commitments which might be entered into for thewar in the Far East, then the War Cabinet must carry responsibilityfor any failure. There could be no question of stinting &quot; Overlord,&quot;and the requirements of the Mediterranean were still large. It was true that the U-boat war showed improvement, but the number of u-boats at sea was still very great and our success was mainly dueto the fact that we had been able to maintain strong escorts. Ifthese were withdrawn there might well be a recrudescence of loss.Discussion then turned upon the proposal to provide 17,200 menin such a way that they could be used in 1945 either in the RoyalAir Force or in the Fleet Air Arm. The War Cabinet agreed thatthe question whether these men should in the first place be enlistedinto the Navy or the Royal Air Force should be settled by directdiscussion between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry.Army. (&amp;) The Secretary of State for War said that he accepted theproposals of the Ministerial Committee for the intake into the Armyin 1944.Royal Air Force. (c) The Secretary of State for Air said that he accepted therecommendations of the Ministerial Committee on intake into theRoyal Air Force in 1944, subject to a further substantial allocation of women in the second half of the year.   The Minister of LabourMan-Power.Policy for1944.
.. Ministry ofSupply.- Ministry ofAircraftProduction.and National Service said that he would not be ready to consider further allocations in May. His figures would not be availableuntil July.The War Cabinet recognised that it might not be possible tocomplete a review of allocations for the second- half of &quot;1944 untilJuly, but considered that the review ought to start in May.id) The Minister of Supply said that he accepted the proposalsof the Ministerial Committee.(e) The Minister of Aircraft Production said that he couldonly carry on with the allocations proposed by the ministerial committee provided the reductions in his labour force were madeon a definite plan and not haphazard, and provided that a new production programme was drawn up and accepted. He alsoemphasised the serious effect on output which would result from any large withdrawal of semi-skilled or skilled labour from the aircraft industry. The Minister of Production pointed out that on thepresent programme 16 - 5 per cent, by structure weight of the aircraft programme would, at the end of 1944, still be in Stirlings andWellingtons. He thought that there was plenty of scope for selective cuts in the programme so as to concentrate efforts on themost valuable types. At the same time, he hoped that the programme would not over-insure on such types, thus leading to an inflateddemand for ancillary equipment.&quot;In further discussion, it was pointed out that Wellingtons were still required in O.T.Us. and for Coastal Command. There were,however, certain projects for the switch of factories from obsoleteto more modern types, a decision on which was urgently required.The projects in question had not yet come before the DefenceCommittee, as they would be affected by the decisions on man-powerallocations. The view of the War Cabinet was that steps should betaken at once to seek from the Defence Committee any decisionsneeded.The Minister of Labour and National Service contested any suggestion that a shortage of labour was responsible for the short-fall in the production programme. An average of over 11,000 menper month had been received in the aircraft industry during the first half of 1943. Nearly 200,000 men and women would be added tothe industry in the second half of the year. These were enormousfigures, but they did not seem to be reflected in the output. Theexpansion of the American aircraft industry showed the pace atwhich new labour could be absorbed if the management was efficient.Discussion then turned upon the five conditions laid down bythe Minister of Aircraft Production in paragraph 13 of his memorandum. Conditions (a), (c) and (d) were generally accepted,and it was agreed that, as proposed in (a), the aircraft programme should be revised by the Ministry of Aircraft Production, in consul-tation with the Admiralty and the Air Ministry. With regard tocondition (b), the Secretary of State for Air said that it was ofgreat importance to the Royal Air Force that new types should beput into production, and he therefore felt bound to take exception to the stipulation that some new types should proceed on develop-ment contracts only.The War Cabinet agreed that this point should be dealt withas part of the revision to be undertaken under (a).With regard to condition (e), the Minister of Labour and national Service pointed out that, in his opinion, it should bepossible to replace, by up-grading, skilled and semi-skilled labour which he would have to withdraw from the aircraft industry tomeet the needs of the Services.The War Cabinet endorsed&apos; this view.(/) The Ministerial Committee had recommended a reductionof 50.000 in the Civil Defence Services beginning on the 1st April,The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe and the other Ministers primarily concerned with Civil Defence1944.[26547-1]b 2
felt obliged to dissent from this recommendation. The reasons fortheir dissent had been set out in his Memorandum (W.P. (43) 535)and could be summarised as follows : (i) Earlier cuts had reduced these Services to a very low level,(ii) Account must be taken of the possibility of heavy air attacks on the ports, assembly points and communica-tions which would be used for the purpose of buroffensive operations from this country. This wouldinvolve reinforcement of the local Civil Defence services from other parts of the country, which would then bemore vulnerable to attack.(iii) The War Cabinet had decided that serious account mustbe taken of the possibility of &quot; Crossbow&quot; attack. Ifthis materialised, military assistance would be required;but, even so, it would be necessary to have a substantial number of Civil Defence personnel with experience infire-fighting and rescue work.(iv) He himself took the view that, when our Forces proceededoverseas, they would be well advised to take with themcontingents of the National Fire Service to fight fires inour bases abroad. .The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatfor these reasons he must dissent from the proposal to cut the civil defence Services by 50,000. If, in spite of his dissent, the WarCabinet decided that this cut must be made, he asked that it shouldbe subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 11 of his memorandum.The Secretary of State for Scotland and the parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Health endorsed these views. TheSecretary of State for Scotland said that he was specially anxiousto avoid any reduction in the strength of the police in Scotland; ifpolice strengths were reduced, he would have to ask the War Officeto assume responsibility for the watching of certain vulnerable points which were now being guarded by the police in Scotland.In discussion, it was pointed out that this recommendation fora reduction in the Civil Defence Services was based on the view that since 1940/41 there had been a substantial reduction in the risk of heavy and sustained air attack on this country; that the maintenanceof the Civil Defence Services at anything like their present strengthmust now be regarded as an insurance against the contingency thatsuch attack would be resumed; and fhat it thus became necessaryto consider whether, when man-power was so short, we were notcarrying too heavy an insurance against this risk. In considering this, it was reasonable to take account of the facts (a) that these services were now much more efficient than they had been, and(6) that we could rely increasingly on part-timers to supplement thewhole-time personnel. If the unexpected happened and heavy attacks were delivered, it was unlikely that they would be sustainedover a long period; and it should be possible to meet the situation byad hoc expedients.In reply to a question by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Chiefs of staff committee had not been asked to appreciate the risk of a resump-tion of heavy air attack, and he could only give his personal opinion.There were in this country large and increasing air forces, bothBritish and American; the German forces opposing them were notincreasing; and our relative air superiority was likely, therefore,to increase. Moreover, our air offensive had compelled the germans to concentrate on the production of fighters. It was unlikely,therefore, that air attack on this country could be resumed.on any large or sustained scale. While we should not, of course, be immune from air attack, it was likely that attacks would be local and light.The Secretary of State for Air endorsed this view. As regardsthe possibility of &quot;Crossbow&quot; attack, he thought that this risk
&apos;      &apos;. was largely met by the proposal to defer reducing the Civil defence services until the 1st April, 1944.The War Cabinet then discussed the conditions proposed inparagraph 11 of W.P. (43) 535.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested thatthe first of these was sufficiently met by the proposal that no with-withdrawals should take place until the 1st April, 1944.As regards the second, he could not accept the suggestion thatthe Civil Defence Ministers should select the persons to be released.He was hoping to find from the Civil Defence Services the additional labour required for inland transport in connection with next year&apos;military operations; and it was essential that he should be able towithdraw a reasonable number of young and active men and women.He would have preferred to call up by age-groups the numbers tobe released from these Services.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security pointedout that calling up by age-groups would seriously impair theefficiency of those Services (e.g., fire and rescue) which needed a fairproportion of young people; and on this account he thought thatthe selection should be made by the Civil Defence Ministers.The view of the War Cabinet was that the age distribution Ofthe persons released must be reasonable having regard to all &apos; thecircumstances; but that, subject to this, the selection should be made. by the Ministry of Labour and National Service and the main civil defence Departments jointly.As regards the third condition, it was agreed that no furtherregular Police should be released.The fourth condition &apos;that normal wastage from the Services. should be taken fully into account&apos; was accepted.The fifth condition was that, to provide substitutes for some ofthe whole-time personnel released, the Minister of Labour and national Service should continue to direct men and women to part-time duties in Civil Defence; and that younger men from the home guard should be directed into part-time Civil Defence as required.The Secretary of State for War said that the latter part of this, condition did not take sufficient account of the extent to which theHome Guard already undertook Civil Defence work as a militaryduty.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested thatat this stage of the war consideration should be given to the possi-bility of a further merging of the Home Guard and the civil defence Services. If this could be done, it would achieve asubstantial economy in man-power. He suggested that this possi-bility might be considered by a small Committee consisting of theChancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair), the Home Secretary andthe Secretary of State for War.   This suggestion was accepted.Building Labour (g) The War Cabinet then discussed building labour for for Housing      housing work.Work. In a Memorandum by the Minister of Health attention was drawn to the urgent need for further labour to be made availablefor repair and maintenance work, and also for the site worksnecessary in preparation for new housing schemes. The associations of Local Authorities were pressing for action to be taken to meet thehousing difficulties in the industrial areas.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the over-crowdingin Scotland was far worse than in England and there was need for more men to be employed on housing work. He suggested that anarrangement might be made whereby men of the National fire service, while continuing to be members of that Service, should bemade available for housing work on the understanding that in emergency they would be recalled to the Fire Service. This would,of course, be additional to the numbers who were to be released from,the Fire Service.
building programme for united states forces.Industries and services inGroups and III.Agriculture.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that hewould be willing to see such an arrangement worked out, and hewould not regard as liable to direction to other work members of the fire Service employed in this way on building work.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health thought the Ministry of Health would be glad if a similar scheme could be worked out as regards England and Wales.(h) The Minister of Labour and National Service and theMinister of Production drew attention to the serious difficulty ofdealing with the allocation of building labour in view of the new andunforeseen demands which were constantly being presented. In thisconnection particular attention was drawn to the programme of construction of airfields.The War Cabinet were informed that certain new demands were likely to be presented in the near future on behalf of the UnitedStates Forces, and took the view that no commitments should be entered into in regard to these demands until the whole position hadbeen very thoroughly examined. Furthermore, we should press theUnited States Army Authorities to use existing buildings to thegreatest possible extent,(;&apos;) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was clear thatthe industries and services in this group could not receive the fullallocation for which they had asked. He thought that, before a start was made in preparing a scheme of allocation of man-power for industries in these groups, the Departments concerned shouldbe asked to revise their requirements on the basis of the new assump-tions on which the man-power needs of the Services and munitions industries had now been calculated (paragraph 5 (a) of W.P.(43)490).This was agreed.(k) The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that in thelight of the general position he realised that he could not hope toreceive the full allocation for which he had asked. He thought,however, that the War Cabinet ought to be aware that the inevitable result would be a substantial cut in the potato crop for the ensuingyear (it was already clear that there would be a shortage of potatoesin June of this year), and also a decline in milk production. Hewould have to inform the Agricultural Committees of the positionin broad outline in the course of the next few weeks, since farmers should not be asked to plant potato crops in excess of those whichthey could hope to harvest.The President of the Board of Trade asked whether in working out the man-power requirements of the Group III industries hecould propose a larger net increase balanced by a larger net release.This was agreed.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows :  (1) General. The scheme of allocation of man-power for 1944proposed by the Ministerial Committee in W.P. (43) 539was approved.,(2) Royal Navy. For the Royal Navy there should be an intake of 50,000, while a further 17,200 should be so trainedfor air duties that they could be employed in 1945 either in the Royal Air Force or Fleet Air Arm. The questionwhether these men should in the first place be enlistedin the Navy or Royal Air Force should be settled by direct discussion between the Admiralty and AirMinistry.(3) Aircraft Production.-The Report by the ministerial committee on Man-Power had assumed that the alloca-tion proposed for the Ministry of Aircraft production would involve a revision of the aircraft programme.This revision should be carried out by the Ministry of aircraft Production, in consultation with the admiralty and the Air Ministry, with a view to achieving a concen-tration on the most valuable types.
(4) The Ministry of Labour and National Service should arrange for the reduction in the labour force of theaircraft industry to be carried out in such a way as tomeet, so far as possible, the substance of the points madein paragraph 13 (c) and (d) of the Memorandum by theMinister of Aircraft Production (W.P. (43) 545). Itwould not be possible, however, to stipulate that thereshould be no reduction in the present proportion of skilled and semi-skilled labour in the aircraft industry.(5) Civil Defence.-The Civil Defence Services should bereduced by 50,000, subject to the following conditions : (a) no withdrawals should take place until the 1st April,1944;(b) There should be no withdrawals from the regular police;(c) releases from the other Services should be so arranged as to secure a reasonable age distribution among those released; but, subject to observance of this condition, the selection of the persons to be released should be made jointly by the Ministryof Labour and National Service, the Ministry ofHome Security, the Ministry of Health and theScottish Departments concerned;(d) full account should be taken of normal wastage fromall the Services throughout the whole year;(e) the Ministry of Labour and National Service shouldcontinue to direct men and women to part-timeduties in Civil Defence, to the extent necessary toprovide substitutes for some of the whole-timepersonnel released.(6) A Committee was set up, consisting of Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security,Secretary of State for War,to state the extent to which Civil Defence work is already undertaken by the Home Guard, and to consider whetherit would be practicable to secure some further mergingof these two Services.(7) Building Labour.-Note was taken of the suggestion thatan arrangement should be made whereby men of theNational Fire Service, while continuing to be membersof that Service, should be made available for housingwork, on the understanding that in emergency theywould be recalled, to the Fire Service.The Minister of Production was invited to arrangefor a meeting of representatives of the Departments&apos; concerned to work out a plan on the above lines.(8) Industries in Groups II and III. The Chancellor of theExchequer was invited to arrange for detailed alloca-tions to be settled, under the supervision of the ministerial Committee on Man-Power, for the industries and services in Groups II and III (other, of course, thanthose industries for which detailed allocations hadalready been made.)As a first step to the settlement of these allocations,the Departments concerned should revise their require-ments on the basis of the assumption in regard toman-power set out in paragraph 5 (a) of the Memo-randum by the Prime Minister (W.P. (43) 490).(9) A further review of the position should be set on foot inMay 1944.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,1st December, 1943.
