The Lebanon.(previous reference erence:W.M. (43) 154thConclusions,Minute 2.)Greece.(previous reference :W.M. (43) 38thConclusions,Minute 2.)[264452. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43) 518) suggesting that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Greece shouldbe reviewed.In his Memorandum the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsrecommended that the following steps should be taken to deal withthe immediate problems :  (i) We should break with the present leaders of E.A.M.-E.L.A.S.(ii) We should invite the King of the Hellenes to make adeclaration that, at the moment of liberation, a RegencyCouncil would be nominated and that he himself would remain outside Greece until the constitutional issue hadbeen settled.(iii) Archbishop Damaskinos should be authorised to appointsuch a Regency Council at the appropriate time and, inthe meanwhile, should take the lead in uniting moderate opinion.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had had long discussions on this matter whilst in Cairo. He read to the WarCabinet extracts from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Middle east defence Committee at which the matter had been considered. these would be circulated to the War Cabinet.No doubt, if the matter was regarded solely from the military point of view, there was a case for continuing to support E.A.M.-E.L.A.S. This organisation operated in the area East of the PindusMountains, through which the main Greek communications ran;and operations to interrupt these communications were of con-siderable value to us.On the other hand, it was quite certain that, if we continued tosupport this movement, which was Communist led, we should be faced with acute difficulties and the Greek Government wouldresign and the King of Greece would abdicate. He was sure that weshould have to break with the present leaders of E.A.M.-E.L.A.S.;and, if so, the sooner this was done the better.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that he agreed withthe course suggested by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,if its military consequences could be accepted.-3] b 21. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that therewas as yet no news of further developments in the Lebanon, and-the indications were that General Catroux might intend to play for time. In that event, it might be necessary for us to make it clear what action we should feel compelled to take if the LebaneseMinisters -were not released within a stated time. He would put before the War Cabinet on the following day proposals for such atime-table.The War Cabinet were informed that the Government of india would prefer that Indian troops should not be used for the purposeof restoring order in the Lebanon. If, however, we were compelledto take rapid action, we should have no alternative but to use indian troops, since we had few other troops in the neighbourhood. TheSecretary of State for India recognised that in that event indian troops would have to be used; but he asked that the Viceroy shouldbe informed in advance of the reasons why it was necessary to use them, and that the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, should keepthe Viceroy informed of developments.The War Cabinet-Agreed to review the position on the following day, in thelight of the further information then available.
The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the latest information in the possession of the Chiefs of Staff showed thatE.A.M.-E.L.A.S. had played a very important part in interruptingcommunications in this part of Greece and in holding german divisions in this area. To close down our support for E.A.M.-E.L.A.S. at this moment would, according to the latest information available to the Chiefs of Staff, be definitely contrary to our militaryinterests. He had, however, wired to the Middle East for the latestappreciation of the situation from the military point of view.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff added that, while on present information he did not favour the first recommendation ofthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he raised no objection tothe second and third.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that there wasa conflict of evidence about the value of E.A.M.-E.L.A.S. Thelatest information at the disposal of the Foreign Office was to theeffect that E.L.A.S. were doing little to fight the Germans, though itwas true that they provided harbourage for British Officers to carryout activities against the Germans. On the other hand, at thepresent time E.L.A.S. were engaged in fighting Zervas.Discussion then turned to the second and third recommenda-tions in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.Field-Marshal Smuts urged that the best way of dealing withthis matter would be to invite the King of Greece to pay a visit tothis country, possibly with his Prime Minister. If this was done,it might be possible to induce the King to take, of his own accord,action on the lines proposed, namely, that he would undertake, afterGreece had been liberated, to wait until normal conditions had beenestablished before returning to the country, thus allowing an interval in which the constitutional issue could be settled. he feared, however, that an approach on the lines proposed in theMemorandum would lead to the King&apos;s abdicating and placing upon us the blame for the difficulties which would follow., He also thought that an approach on the lines proposed in the Memorandummight appear inconsistent with our previous attitude of support ofthe King.In further discussion, general agreement was expressed withthe view that it was impossible for us to continue a policy wherebywe accorded support to two factions in the same country which wereattacking each other. On the other hand, it was pointed out thatthe recommendations in the Paper by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs were complementary and stood or fell together.Thus it was intended that the declaration which the King shouldbe asked to give should be used to persuade the rank and file of theE.A.M.-E.L.A.S. movement to support new leaders, who would co-operate with us and act in harmony with other resistancemovements in Greece. It would not, therefore, be practicable toadopt part of the first recommendation of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs until a decision could be reached on the issues as a whole.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) The Chiefs of Staff were obtaining an up-to-date apprecia-tion of the present position of the resistance movements in Greece, their value from the point of view of militaryoperations, and the effect thereon of withdrawal of support from the present leaders of the E.A.M.-E.L.A.S.bands. When this Report had been received, discussionof the Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs would be resumed in the War Cabinet.(2) In the meantime, supplies should continue to be withheld from E.A.M.-E.L.A.S. and all possible action should be&apos;taken to build up Zervas.
The Blockade.Increase in supplies forGreece.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 21stConclusions,Minute 5.)3. It was proposed in the Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43) 518) that the blockade of greece should be further relaxed in order to increase the relief which was now being distributed by the Swedish-Swiss organisation in Greece. This proposal was discussed in further detail in theMemorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare (W.P. (43) 521).In discussion, the Minister of Economic Warfare put forwardtwo specific suggestions : First, he pointed out that it was likely that in the coming-winter the need for clothing would be even more acute in Greecethan the need for food. He understood that the Americans were considering the possibility of collecting used clothing and shoes for children in Greece. He thought that a case could be made out fortreating Greece differently in this respect from other occupied territories; but he had at present no authority to send clothing to greece.The War Cabinet took the view that no objection need be raised to this proposal to send clothing to Greece, provided that thedespatch of clothing would not diminish the quantity of foodsupplied to Greece and that the Swedish-Swiss organisation were willing to undertake its distribution.Secondly, the Minister pointed out that, whereas the foodhitherto supplied to Greece had been mainly wheat, pulse and tinnedmilk, the greatest need now appeared to be for meat and fish, whichwas required at the rate of 2,000. tons a month. He enquire whether he should take up with the Americans the possibility of supplying meat and fish as well as wheat.The view of the War Cabinet on this point was that, if meatwere supplied to Greece, it would become increasingly difficult tojustify the existing discrimination between Greece and otheroccupied territories. The possibility of supplying meat to Greececould not be raised with the Americans without risk of provokingfurther agitation from the organisations in America which had previously been anxious to supply food through the blockade to other european territories in enemy occupation. This objection probablywould not apply to a proposal to increase the amount of tinned milkwhich was being sent into Greece.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Economic Warfare to explore withthe United States Administration the possibility of sending supplies of used clothing to Greece, on the con-ditions indicated above, and the question of increasing thepresent supplies of tinned milk. No steps should, however,be taken with a view to arranging for supplies of meat andfish to be sent to Greece at the present time.Greece. 4.   The Secretary of State for War said that arrangementsFood Supplies    were being made by the Military Authorities to accumulate foodwhen Liberated; supplies, to cover six weeks, for the whole of Greece when thecountry had been liberated.  It was hoped that this stock would have(3) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should tell theMinister of State Resident in the Middle East, for hisown information, that the War Cabinet contemplated that the best method of dealing with the issues in regardto the King of the Hellenes would be to invite him tocome to London on a visit, accompanied perhaps by his prime Minister.(4) In the meantime, a decision was deferred on the recommen-dations in the Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.
been accumulated, by the end of the year. The next stage would beto place orders for the accumulation of food supplies to cover aperiod of six months. It was clear, however, that orders for food on this scale could only be placed in America, and difficulties werebeing encountered in placing the necessary orders.The War Cabinet-Invited the Ministerial Committee on Supply Questions in liberated and Conquered Areas, to be set up under the revised Civil Affairs Organisation (see Minute 5 below),to enquire into this matter.5. The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda (W.P.(43) 514 and 519) by the Deputy Prime Minister about civil affairs in liberated and conquered areas.The War Cabinet first considered the outline of Civil AffairsOrganisation in this country (Gen. 22/2 appended to W.P. (43) 519).The following points were made in discussion : (1) The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Committee onArmistice Terms and Civil Administration had agreed that,although the general principle should be accepted that responsibilityfor the final or third stage rested with the Foreign Office, responsi-bility for the administration of Eritrea, Somaliland, Libya andTripolitania should remain with the War Office for the present.(2) The Minister of Labour and National Service asked that heshould be included on the Ministerial Committee on SupplyQuestions in Liberated and Conquered Areas and that a represen-tative of his Department should be a member of the official committee dealing with these matters.This was agreed to.(3) The Secretary of State for War said that with so many-Departments or agencies concerned in these matters there was a risk that the same matter might be handled independently throughdifferent channels, or that Departments might be insufficientlyinformed of kindred matters which were being handled elsewhere.He suggested that the Secretary of the War Cabinet should be instructed to report whether some central clearing arrangementcould be devised for all telegraphic correspondence on these matters.This was agreed to.The War Cabinet-Approved the Outline of Proposals for  Civil AffairsOrganisation in this country set out in paragraphs 1-12 ofGen. 22/2, and invited the Ministers concerned to makethe necessary arrangements to give effect to them forthwith.The War Cabinet then considered the Memorandum on theAnglo-American Organisation for Civil Affairs (W.P. (43) 514).The Minister of State said that he had now received some further information as, to the changes in organisation in washington dealing with these matters. As a result, he thoughtthat it would not be in our interests to weaken the WashingtonCombined Civil Affairs Committee, or to press the proposals in theMemorandum too hard, if they were strongly opposed by the UnitedStates Authorities.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet -Approved the Memorandum (W.P. (43) 514) and agreedthat the matter should be taken up with the United states authorities, on the lines indicated therein, at a high level.Civil AffairsOrganisation in liberated andConqueredAreas.
Parliament. 6.   The War Cabinet discussed the arrangements for theopening weeks of the new Session of Parliament.It had already been decided that Parliament should beprorogued on the 23rd November; it was now agreed that duringthe course of that day the House of Commons should go into secret session in order that they might be informed of some of thearrangements having a bearing on the Debate on the Address. Itwould probably be necessary that this Debate should continue untilthe 9th December. The plan of the Debate would be to hold on thefirst two days a general discussion mainly devoted to reconstruction problems and other domestic subjects; to pass then to the discussionof Amendments to the Address and certain special topics; and to end with two days&apos; Debate on the general war situation and foreignaffairs.It was pointed out in the discussion that the legislative programme for the forthcoming Session was likely to be heavy; andon this account it was undesirable that too much time should be spent in general Debate on the Address. Several Bills had to be passed into law before Christmas; and it was desirable that someparliamentary time should be found, before Parliament adjournedon the 16th December, for the discussion of some more substantial measure, e.g.. the Disabled Persons (Employment) Bill. In thisconnection reference was made to the possibility that, later in the session, some alteration might have to be made in the hours of sitting of Parliament if satisfactory progress was to be made withthe Governments programme of legislation. The War Cabinet were informed that this matter was under consideration by theLegislation Committee.The War Cabinet-Took note of the arrangements proposed for the openingweeks of the new Session of Parliament, and of the points which had been raised in the course of the discussion.Parliament.King&apos;s speech on Opening ofParliament.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 152ndConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The War Cabinet were informed that a suggestion had beenmade that The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament might include some reference to the forthcoming discussions about thefuture of agriculture. For example, after the sentence stating that&quot; It will be the primary aim of My Government to ensure that ....in industry, mining and agriculture, a smooth transition is made from war to peace,&quot; a sentence might be added to the following effect: &quot;As a preparatory step, I welcome the announcement thatconsultations are about to take place with the representatives of theagricultural industry on post-war policy.&quot;In discussion, it was pointed out that agriculture was already mentioned in the existing draft in a sentence (quoted above) whichhad been carefully worded with a view to preserving a balance between agriculture and other industrial interests; and this balance would be disturbed if a further sentence were added about thediscussions with the industry on post-war industry. Such an addition would certainly invite comment on the absence of any similar statement about discussions regarding the post-war positionof other industries, e.g., the coal-mining industry.The War Cabinet-Agreed that no alteration should be made, on the lines suggested, in the draft of The King&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,lQth November, 1943.
