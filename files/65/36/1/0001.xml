Monetary 1.   The  War  Cabinet  considered a  Memorandum by the clearing Union. Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (43) 428) covering an exchange(Previous of telegrams regarding the progress of the discussions nowReference: proceeding in Washington about the scheme for a Monetary ClearingW.M. (43) 121st Union.Conclusions, At their meeting on the 2nd September the War Cabinet had minute 1.) agreed that, while countries should retain a reasonable freedom to vary their own exchange rates, an endeavour should be made toensure that decisions to modify exchange rates were taken by reference to some objective test. Our Delegation had communicatedinformally to the Americans tentative suggestions for a method of determining foreign exchange rates under the scheme. These were set out in the telegram (4174 Abide) reproduced in Appendix A tothe Memorandum.   The principal features were  (1) Each country would be free to vary the exchange value ofits currency up to a limit of 10 per cent., i.e., if the variation, inclusive of any previous variations since theestablishment of the Board, did not exceed 10 per cent,within the preceding 10 years.(2) In an emergency each country would be free to make a variation up to a further 10 per cent, without the prior approval of the Board, but subject to subsequent ratifica-tion by the Board. If this ratification were withheld,the country would have the option of reversing thechange or withdrawing from membership.(3) All other variations of exchange rates would require prior approval; but in considering applications the board would be guided by certain objective principles. Itwould be required to allow variation of rates if (a) thethe relative money costs of production in the applicantcountry had increased with the result that its currencywas over-valued; or (5) the balance on current account,together with inward long-term capital transactions(measured as a percentage of its foreign trade), had been seriously adverse over a period; or (c) the country&apos;sremaining holding of liquid reserves was inadequate.It was understood that the Americans were likely to accept these proposals, subject to minor modifications.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the view of his principal advisers, the provision which these proposals made for theunilateral variation of exchange rates would not give sufficientlatitude during the unsettled conditions which were likely to obtainduring the transitional period immediately following the end of thewar: In the financial crisis of 1931 it had been necessary for usto vary our exchange rates by as much as 30 per cent, within aperiod of a few months; and, although this had admittedly been an exceptionally critical period, it must be assumed that conditionsin the period immediately following the end of hostilities would bevery difficult. It was true that we should like to see some restrictionplaced on the freedom of. some of the smaller nations to depreciatetheir currency; but, if we tried at the outset to impose too rigid a restriction, it was likely that these nations would either decline toaccept the scheme or would insist on the insertion of reservationswhich would stultify the scheme. On balance, therefore, he favoured an arrangement which would recognise no unilateral freedom to&apos;make limited variations in exchange rates, but would provide thatadjustment of rates (without stated limits) might be made afterconsultation with the Board though not subject to their approval.He therefore proposed that further instructions should be sent toour Delegation in Washington on the lines of the draft telegramreproduced as Appendix B of his Memorandum. This would requireour Delegates to take the line that (i) there should be definiteagreement to accept stability of exchanges as the foundation ofinternational economic relations; (ii) exchange adjustment should
61W.M. 133 (43).be in accordance with objective principles, on the lines indicatedin the Delegations telegram 4174; but (iii) it should be agreed thatno adjustment of exchange rates would be made except afterconsultation with the Board, though not subject to the Board&apos;approval; and (iv) after 5 years, or earlier, the Board shouldformulate for consideration by member States rules governing theprocedure for adjustment of exchanges. At that stage it might bepossible to introduce provision for the unilateral variation ofexchanges, within stated limits, on the lines contemplated in the delegation&apos;s proposals.Points in discussion were :; (a) The view was expressed that, for the purposes of the transitional period after the war, a right of unilateral variationup to 10 per cent, would not be enough. On the other hand, for thelong-term situation after the transitional period the figure of 10 percent, would be too high. On practical grounds there was a strong case for differentiating between the transitional situation and thelong-term situation.(6) Moreover, it would not be practicable in the transitional period to fix rates of exchange for certain countries, save on abasis of trial and error.(c) It was also suggested that the five years contemplated inAppendix B of the Memorandum was too long a period to fix for the transitional stage. It would be preferable to give greater scope forunilateral action during a transitional period and, in return, topress for stricter control thereafter. The transitional period mightfor this purpose be taken as 2-3 years.(d) It was felt that, even in the transitional period, some limit should be fixed to the variation of exchange rates which might bemade by unilateral action. This might perhaps be fixed at 25 percent.(e) A number of Ministers took the view that the scheme putforward in Abide 4174 was likely to bring us substantialadvantage; and that, rather than risk a breakdown of thediscussions, it would be preferable to accept the scheme set out inthat telegram as it stood.The general view of the War Cabinet was that a clear distinction should be drawn in this matter between the needs of the transitional period and those of the long-term situation. OurDelegates in Washington should be informed that the War cabinet favoured the proposals outlined in their telegram 4174 so far as concerned the long-term situation. It should, however, be pointedout that these proposals made no special provision for the period immediately following the end of the war (say, some two years), whenconditions were likely to be particularly unstable. Some exceptionalarrangements would have to be devised for this transitional period,and it might be suggested to the Delegation that they should invitethe Americans to put forward suggestions for meeting the needs ofthis transitional period.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare a revised draft, on the lines indicated at&quot; X.&quot; This shouldbe agreed with the Lord President of the Council, the lord privy Sea, the President of the Board of Trade and the paymaster-General, and should then be despatched to our delegation at Washington, without further reference tothe War Cabinet.
