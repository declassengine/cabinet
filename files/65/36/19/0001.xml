The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of the.previous week.. Bomber Command had dropped 2,600 tons of bombs during theweek and made one big raid on dusseldorf. This had been wellconcentrated.Coastal Command had made two attacks on U-boats, one ofwhich was promising. Fighter Command had attacked defenceworks near Calais. Enemy losses had been 29 destroyed, 3 probably. destroyed and 14 damaged. Our losses had been 23 bombers,9 fighters and 5 Coastal Command aircraft. Of 65 enemy aircraft which had raided this country at night, 7 had been destroyed.United States Air Forces had dropped 2,500 tons of bombs on germany in daylight and had made a good attack on Wilhelmshaven.Fourteen bombers had been lost, but the Fortresses and their fighter escort claimed *75 enemy aircraft destroyed during the week&apos;operations.Weather in the Mediterranean had been bad, but 2,100 tons of bombs had been dropped on enemy communications, airfields andtargets in the land battle. In addition, Wiener Neustadt had been attacked. Enemy losses in this area had been 97 aircraft comparedwith 43 Allied.Enquiries showed that the bombing of the Vatican City duringthe previous week could not have been done by Allied aircraft.Rabaul Harbour had been attacked by Allied aircraft on two occasions and large numbers of enemy warships and merchant ships had been claimed as either sunk or damaged.Shipping losses by enemy action, including belated reports,during the previous week amounted to 33,127 tons.It was now certain that 26 U-boats had been sunk during themonth of October.In home waters and the North Atlantic there had been considerable activity by E-boats, of which several had been seriously damaged. We had lost three small merchant ships. An enemyconvoy had been attacked off the Dutch coast on the night of the3rd/4th November, when one enemy trawler had been sunk andothers damaged.The enemy had attacked an eastbound convoy off Philippevilleon the 6th November, when a 19,000-ton Dutch ship had been sunk.(This ship was not included in the figures of last week&apos;s losses.)Troops and stores had been landed on Leros during the week.On the night of the lst/2nd November an Allied Naval Forcecovering a landing on Bougainville Island had engaged and drivenoff a Japanese Force of cruisers and destroyers. One Japanesecruiser and four destroyers had been sunk. Allied ships sufferedminor damage.During the previous week our forces had advanced from 10 to12 miles along the whole front.The Russians had carried out a minor offensive in the VelikiLuki area. This was probably a holding operation. From Loev toKieff the Dneiper had been crossed to a depth of 20 miles. the taking of Kieff and the drive beyond the city had been a fineperformance, the results of which might be very serious to the enemy.At Kerch two more landings had been made and a foothold obtained.The Russian successes of the last three weeks showed that theGermans had not been able to hold the line on which they had intended to make a stand.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
Air Raids:Casualties and damage.Reports in thePress.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 12thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. Reference was made to the direct hit on a dance-hall inPutney on the previous night, in which 70 people had lost their lives and over 100 had been seriously injured.Considerable publicity had been given to this incident in several of the morning papers. It had been stated that much damage had been done to a dance-hall; and there had been severalpointers to the number of casualties which had resulted.The Prime Minister said that notices of this kind in the Presswould encourage the enemy to continue his attacks on this country.He thought that these reports were contrary to the spirit, at anyrate, of the ruling that figures of casualties in particular raidsshould not be stated without special authority unless they were verysmall.The Prime Minister suggested that so long as air raidscontinued on the present scale the following course should beadopted : (a) Figures giving the total air-raid casualties should continueto be published periodically ^say, once a month.(b) Detailed accounts of particular incidents should not bepublished in the Press without special authority, forwhich the sanction of the War Cabinet should beobtained.The War Cabinet-Invited  the  Home  Secretary  and  Minister  of  home security and the Minister of Information to consider an amendment of present practice on the above lines.Discussions with turkey.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 149thConclusions,Minute 2.)3.   The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet the latest infor-mation about the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos; discussions-with the Turkish Foreign Minister.This account is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofWar Cabinet Conclusions.Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 138thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Prime Minister said that Count Sforza was now taking a hand in the discussions about the remodelling of the ItalianGovernment. The question of whether the King of Italy shouldabdicate had also been raised.The Prime Minister said he had reached the conclusion thatthe balance of advantage was against attempts being made tobroaden the basis of the Italian Government before Rome had been captured, and that the present Government should carry on for thetime being. We were using our influence in this direction, and he hoped that this course met with the approval of his colleagues.The War Cabinet-Endorsed this view.Ethiopia.(Previous5.   The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the deputy minister of State Resident in the Middle East (W.P. (43) 487)Reference:        drawing attention to the unsatisfactory conditions obtaining in w.M. (43) 101st Ethiopia.Conclusions, ihe Deputy Minister of State Resident in the Middle EastMmute 3.)        SSb^ ^e situation in Ethiopia was rapidly deteriorating.Internal disorder was increasing; there were grave abuses in theadministration of justice; the communications and other publicworks installed by the Italians were falling into decay; and, ingeneral, the country was quickly losing its veneer of civilisation.From the short-term point of view, this increasing disorganisation
threatened our chances of obtaining the supplies (e.g., wheat, rubber and hides) which we had hoped to obtain from Ethiopia. And it also prejudiced our long-term aims; for we could not expect tosecure these from, the Emperor except in return for territorialconcessions in Eritrea, which we could scarcely advocate at the PeaceConference unless there was a prospect of orderly government in ethiopia.When he had raised this issue in the past he had been informed by the Foreign Office that we had not assumed any responsibilityfor ensuring orderly government in Ethiopia; and that on this account it would be inappropriate for us to institute any localenquiries with a view to improving the present system ofadministration. The purpose of his Memorandum was to suggestthat, for the reasons which he had outlined, our policy towardsEthiopia should now be reviewed; that we should be prepared, ifreasonable proposals could be made, to assist the Emperor to develophis country and lay the foundations of a sound administration; andthat, as a first step, representatives of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Minister of State Resident in the middle east should be sent to Addis Ababa to enquire into the presentconditions and to report on the best means of assisting the Emperorto develop his country and improve its administration.. The Minister of State said that, while he supported theproposal for an enquiry, he was not in agreement with all thearguments put forward in W.P. (43) 487. In particular, he thoughtit important that we should not assume a direct responsibility for ensuring orderly government in Ethiopia. This might involve usin disproportionately heavy liabilities.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was mainly concerned with the reconsideration of one item in the presentstatement of our long-term interests in Ethiopia, viz., that theBritish-protected tribes in Somaliland should enjoy unimpeded useof their habitual grazing grounds across the frontier intoEthiopian territory. He. considered that, if the interests of BritishSomalis were to be adequately protected, it was necessary that thesegrazing grounds should be brought within the frontiers of british somali land.The Prime Minister said that he hoped that this point wouldnot be pressed to the prejudice of the general principle that we desired to obtain no territorial advantages from the war.The Prime Minister said that, when our present policy inrespect of Ethiopia had been determined in 1941, we were not ina position to undertake any fresh responsibilities. He thought,however, that the existing policy might now be reviewed afresh inthe light of our present circumstances. He thought that we couldnot afford to permit our liberation of Ethiopia to be stultified by allowing the country to lapse into a state of barbarism whichcompared most unfavourably with its condition during the periodof Italian control. This would be a reproach to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and an injustice to the troops from this country andthe Dominions who had driven the Italians out of Ethiopia. Onthese grounds he felt &quot;that the time had come to reconsider ouipolicy and our long-term aims. For the moment, however, he onlysuggested that an enquiry should be held for the purpose ofassembling the facts and considering what steps could be taken toimprove the position.The Prime Minister&apos;s view was accepted by the War Cabinet.Mr. Bruce suggested that consideration might be given to thepossibility of arr-anging for joint Anglo-American interest in ethiopia. &apos; The view was expressed that it might be preferable to postpone this suggestion until consideration could be given afterthe war to the possibility of placing Ethiopia under some form ofinternational tutelage.   The question of American participation in
any interim arrangements that might be made need not, however, be wholly excluded from consideration at this stage.It was also suggested that in any review of the position whichmight now be undertaken due consideration should be given to theeconomic as well as the political factors involved.The War Cabinet-(1) Recorded the view that it was open to question whether thepolicy which they had adopted in respect of Ethiopiain 1941 still represented the limits of His Majesty&apos;governments interests in Ethiopia; and that there were grounds for reviewing that policy in the light of the changes which had taken place in the general world situation since 1941.(2) Appointed a Committee consisting of The Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for War,The Minister of State,The Deputy Minister of State Resident in theMiddle East,to review our existing policy in respect of Ethiopia andto make early recommendations to the War Cabinet asto the lines on which a further enquiry might be made into the means of improving conditions in Ethiopia, thepersons by whom such an enquiry should be made, andthe instructions by which they should be guided.6. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Ministerof State (W.P. (43) 491) covering a Memorandum prepared inconsultation with the Departments concerned about the future ofthe Suez Canal and of the Suez Canal Company&apos;s Concession.The Prime Minister said that he thought that the issues raised in this Paper did not call for settlement in the immediate future.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Took note of the Memorandum, and agreed that it shouldbe brought forward for consideration at a later date.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,8th November, 1943.
