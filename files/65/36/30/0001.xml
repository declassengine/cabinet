Coal.Man-power for theCoalminingIndustry.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 137thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the lord president of the Council (W.P. (43) 531) regarding the need for increasing the labour force in the coal-mining industry.It was explained in the Memorandum that the plans for increasing the labour force by voluntary means had not yieldedsufficient results, and it was now necessary to arrange to call upcompulsorily to the coal-mines fit men of military age who would otherwise be called up for the Armed Forces. The method of applying this selective compulsion had been carefully consideredby the Minister of Labour and National Service, who had reachedthe conclusion that the selection must be made by ballot. this conclusion had been endorsed by the Lord Presidents Committee.The method by which the ballot would be conducted was outlined inthe Memorandum.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty said that hehad been asked by the First Lord to refer again to the point whichhe had raised when this matter had come before the Lord presidents committee, viz., whether persons who had volunteered for, and beenaccepted by, one of the Services before reaching the age of compulsory military service would be excluded from this ballot.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that menwho were already in the Armed Forces would, of course, be excludedfrom the ballot, even though they had joined up as volunteers before reaching the age of compulsory military service. He could not,however, give an assurance which would have the result that anyperson below the age of call-up could escape the ballot for thecoal-mines by volunteering to join one of the Armed Forces.Youths who volunteered in this way were placed on a deferred list,and sometimes remained on this list for a substantial period before they were drafted into the Service by which they had been accepted.At times the numbers on this deferred list were considerable; andthere was likely to be discontent if all the young men in this position were automatically excluded from the ballot. His wholepurpose was to secure a scheme which would be, and appear, fair to all; and this purpose would be defeated if the ballot could be avoided by volunteering for one of the Armed Forces before reaching the age of compulsory military service. He had already undertaken to ensure that a limited number of young men with special qualifica-tions would be excluded from the ballot, i.e,, men who had beenaccepted for flying duties in the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air-Arm, or as artificers in submarines, and men in the short list of highly skilled occupations and the &quot; Y &quot; Scheme; and his Depart-ment would consider with the Admiralty what categories oftradesmen, &amp;c, required for the Navy could be excluded under this head.The view of the War Cabinet was that the scheme outlined inthe Memorandum would be acceptable to the public generally only if the basis of selection were such as to win public confidence in itsimpartiality; and on this account it was essential to limit to theminimum the special classes which would be excluded from the ballot.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals outlined in W.P. (43) 531;  and took note that the Minister of Labour and National service would announce the scheme in a statement to be made inthe House of Commons on Thursday, the 2nd December.Note. Subsequent to the meeting it was suggested that there was gravedoubt whether men accepted for the Services could legally be brought withinthe scope of the ballot; and that, for this reason, it would be necessary to placesome restrictions on the acceptance by the Services of young men volunteeringbefore reaching the age of compulsory military service.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,2Qth November, 1943.Eise. 2.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reported thatThe Kerlogue an Eire ship, Kerlogue, when on her way to Spain, had been attackedCase. on the 23rd October by British aircraft.   The master and seamenof the crew had been wounded the master seriously.This ship had been carrying a British cargo and the masterhad, for many years, been on service in British ships. Enquiry had shown that the vessel had been given instructions to follow a course which would take her well to the west of the Prohibited Area, butthat at the time the vessel was attacked she was well off her course,steering to enter the Prohibited Area, but had not entered it.We had informed the Eire Government of the results of ourenquiries into this matter, and had stated that we could not accept any liability. We had now been asked whether we would grant anyex gratia compensation to the injured members of the crew.Sir John Maffey was anxious that this should be done, since it would facilitate his negotiations for the release of the remaining Britishairmen interned in Eire.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs sought the advice of the War Cabinet as to whether there was any political objectionto making ex gratia grants in these cases., One suggestion made in discussion was that we might dispose of the matter by giving ex gratia grants, under such conditions&apos; thatthe fact that we had done so would not be made public.The view of the War Cabinet was&apos;that there was no reason why we should not make ex gratia grants openly in this case, seeing that the matter arose out of a mistake, and that the ship had been engaged in carrying a British cargo at the time.
