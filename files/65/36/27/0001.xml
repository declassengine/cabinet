The Lebanon. 1.   The War Cabinet met to consider the position in the(Previous       Lebanon.reference: The Minister of State Eesident in the Middle East had seenW.M. (43) 157th General Catroux at Beirut on the 19 th November and had presentedConclusions.) an aide-memoire. This stated that unless our demands were met by 10 a.m. on the following Monday we should declare Britishmartial law in the Lebanon. It was made clear that our demandsincluded the immediate replacement of M. Helleu and the releaseof the Lebanese President and Ministers, who would revert to theirstatus prior to the recent crisis. General Catroux had taken thematter calmly, but had said that the time allowed was very shortin view of the time which his telegrams were taking between Beirutand Algiers.The War Cabinet also had before them, a telegram fromSir Edward Spears (No. 723), reporting an interview with GeneralCatroux at 11-30 a.m. on Saturday morning (Mr. Casey having inthe meantime returned to. Cairo). General Catroux had said thathe had received a telegram from Algiers giving him authority to release and reinstate the Lebanese President. The other ministers were to be released, but it appeared that they were to be deprived of office permanently.In the course of this interview Sir Edward Spears had made clear the difficulties which would arise unless the Lebanese ministers were reinstated; until this had been done the deadlock would continue. General Catroux had hinted that he did not dissent fromthis view, but was bound by instructions from Algiers.The War Cabinet also had before them four telegrams fromthe Resident Minister, Algiers (Nos. 2423, 2424, 2432 and 2433),reporting discussions which Mr. Macmillan had had withM. Massigli. From these telegrams it was clear that the french committee had now agreed to the immediate recall of M. tleileu toAlgiers and to the release of the Lebanese Government. But they asked for further time for discussion of other outstanding issues.Mr. Macmillan pressed strongly for this extension of time andrecalled that on the first occasion when he had tabled our demandswith the French Committee he had asked for the release of thearrested Ministers, and that at this stage we had not also demandedtheir reinstatement.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the WarCabinet that as time was short he had telegraphed to Mr. Casey(No. 3695) that morning, in which he had summarised the positionand agreed to the extension of the time limit for 48 hours, i.e., until10 a.m. on Wednesday, the 24th November.Summarising the position, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that while it was very tempting to accept the view putforward by Mr. Macmillan that, now that the French had concededso much, we should not press for the immediate reinstatement ofthe Ministers concerned, he felt convinced that in practice this. would not provide any real solution of the difficulty.Discussion showed that the War Cabinet was in agreement.with this view.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs circulated a draft telegram to the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East, tobe repeated to Algiers and Beirut. The gist of this telegram wasthat the War Cabinet could not yield on the question of reinstate-ment. There would have to be modtts vivendi negotiations, and these could only be conducted with the legitimate Lebanese Government.In discussion of this draft telegram, the following points weremade: -(a) As it was now clear that General Cafcroux had not gotplenipotentiary powers, we should have to concentrate on negotia-tions with the French Committee at Algiers. Accordingly, the telegram should be addressed to Mr. Macmillan and repeated toMr. Casey at Cairo and to Beirut. (This would involve somerecasting of the draft.)
(b) For the same reason, it was essential that Mr. Macmillanshould stay at Algiers until the negotiations with the Committeehad been concluded.(c) It should also be made clear that the extension of 48 hourswhich had been accorded was the furthest to which we wereprepared to go.(d) The position as we understood it in the light of the latest information from Algiers and Beirut should be recapitulated, anddoubtful points cleared up.  Thus : (i) Our demand for the recall of M. Helleu had been conceded in principle.(ii) The release and reinstatement of the President had beenagreed to.(iii) The physical release of the Ministers would also beagreed to.(iv) On the other hand, the reinstatement of the Ministers stillpresented a difficulty, &apos;and according to Sir EdwardSpears&apos;s telegram (No. 723) General Catroux seemed to imply that they were to be deprived of office permanently.(v) The elimination of Emir Eclcle and his colleagues had notyet been agreed to.In a sense (iv) and (v) were both parts of the same question.(e) The point made by Sir Edward Spears in paragraph 3 of his telegram (No. 723 from Beirut) should be stressed, viz., that unlessthe former Ministers resumed their positions on being released, the deadlock would not be resolved. Mr. Macmillan might also beinformed that it had been made clear at the outset by Mr. Caseyto General Catroux (whom we then thought was a plenipotentiary)that our demand was that the Ministers should not merely be released but should be reinstated. Moreover, further examination ofthe position here convinced us that release automatically carriedwith it resumption of their position as Ministers. The essentialpoint was that the Ministers, once released, should be free to resume negotiations for a modus vivendi with their status as Ministersunimpaired. Otherwise there was a risk that the negotiations woulddegenerate into a discussion of what personalities should be includedin a new Lebanese Government.if) The telegram should include a reference to paragraph 2 of telegram No. 3695 from the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs to Mr. Casey,&apos;making clear the matters to be covered by negotia-tions for a modus vivendi after release, i.e., the manner in whichthe released President and Ministers will exercise their functions as regards reforms and modifications of the status quo.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to revisehis draft telegram, in the light of the points raised in discussion, and to despatch it, after consultation with the deputy Prime Minister, but without further reference tothe War Cabinet.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that froma telegram* just received from the Minister of State Resident inthe Middle East, it appeared that two brigades of Indian infantrywere to be moved into the Beirut area that night, the 21st/22ndNovember. There would still be time to stop this move if it were thought, in view of the extension of the time limit and of the latest developments, that this movement of troops might cause undesirablerepercussions.* Cairo No. 2645.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that thedecision should be left to the authorities in Cairo; on the whole,the effect of these moves would probably be salutary.The War Cabinet-Agreed with the view taken by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.Parliament. 2.   The War Cabinet considered whether, in view of the riskKing&apos;s Speech  that the position in the Lebanon might lead to a deterioration inon prorogation of Parliament.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 155thConclusions,Minute 7.)our relations with the French Committee of National Liberation,any alteration was called for in The King&apos;s Speech on the Proroga-tion of Parliament, which contained the following reference to theCommittee : &quot; My Government have welcomed the establishment of theFrench Committee of National Liberation at Algiers, and have recognised it as the body qualified to ensure the conduct of theFrench effort in the war within the framework of inter-allied co-operation. We look forward with the Committee to the liberation of France and her restoration to the ranks of theGreat Powers.&quot;The War Cabinet-Agreed that the position would be met by the deletion ofthe   words   &quot;with   the   Committee&quot;   from   the   aboveparagraph. .Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,21st November, 1943.
