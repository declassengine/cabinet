Demobilisation.       THE War Cabinet had before them the following Memoranda(Previous       regarding  the  proposals for demobilisation from  the ArmedEeference:        ForcesW.M. (43) 111thConclusions, W.P. (43) 494 : Eeport of the Committee appointed by the minute 2.) &apos; War Cabinet on the 4th August, 1943, to carry out a generalsurvey of the demobilisation plans.W.P. (43) 560 :  Memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty.W.P. (43) 553 : Memorandum by the Minister of Labourand National Service.W.P. (43) 548 : Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War.W.P. (43) 543 : Memorandum by the Minister of Works.\; W.P. (43) 556: Memorandum by the Minister of health and the Secretary of State for Scotland.W.P. (43) 561 : Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.The Deputy Prime Minister said that final decisions on the demobilisation plans could not be taken in the absence of the PrimeMinister; but he thought it would be helpful if the War cabinet had a preliminary discussion of some of the points of principleraised in these Memoranda.The main question of principle raised by the Committee&apos;sReport was whether there should be block releases of men urgently required for the post-war needs of certain key industries. On thispoint, opinion on the Committee had been divided. TheParliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Economic Warfare had considered that demobilisation should be ordered largely on the basisof meeting the urgent needs of industry in the reconstruction period.The majority of the Committee had accepted the view of the service departments that block releases for this purpose would arouseserious discontent in the Armed Forces, and had recommended thatsuch block releases should not be generally authorised. They had,however, considered that an exception should be made in the caseof the 15,000 police now in the Armed Forces : these men could be released at an early stage for return to the Police, since this wouldnot involve their entering the labour market and would mean only a transfer from one uniformed service to another. The Committeealso suggested that consideration should be given to the possibilityof block releases of craftsmen for the building industry, in view ofthe exceptionally high priority which would have to be given to house-building in the years immediately following the end of thewar in Europe.The Secretary of State for War said that, if it was to be acceptable to&apos; members of the Services and to the public, the demobilisation scheme must be fair to all. And, if it was to worksmoothly in practice, it must be administratively simple. A systemof block releases would satisfy neither of these requirements. Itwould not be regarded as fair; and it would lay a heavy adminis-trative burden of selection upon the Service Departments and onCommanding Officers. He was therefore opposed to any system ofblock releases. For the same reasons he was unable to favour anyspecial preference in respect of overseas service. A simple schemeof demobilisation according to age and length of service would, hethought, be acceptable to men in the Services and their dependants.Special steps would have to be taken to mitigate the effect of sucha scheme on men who had been serving for long periods in theFar East; but he thought that this point could be met by introducing a system of relief drafts, where it was not possible for operational reasons to bring whole formations home.The First Lord of the A dmiralty endorsed these views, So faras the Navy was concerned, the amount of demobilisation after theend of the war with Germany was likely to be small. But there was bound to be discontent in the Navy if, in the other Services, there
were any system of block releases or any special preference in respectof overseas service (which could not be applied to the Navy).The Secretary of State for Air also supported the views expressed by the Secretary of State for War. While he recognisedthat there was a strong case on national grounds for a system ofblock releases related to the post-war needs of industry, it wouldbe impossible to combine such a system with the basic principle of release according to age and length of service; and he believed thatit was only by a widespread application of that principle thatdiscontent in the Services could be avoided.It was pointed out that, so far as concerned the scale and rateof demobilisation, the Committee&apos;s Report was based on the appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff of the scale of our military effortagainst Japan after the end of the war with Germany. It wassuggested that there might perhaps be room for some reduction inthe original estimates.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had had a note onthis point from the Minister of Production, who was unable toattend the meeting. The Minister had pointed out that the distancesinvolved in a war in the Par East would retard the rate of ourdeployment, and this factor would have the result that more men would be available for demobilisation; but, on the other hand, theoriginal estimates had assumed a greater total strength both in theServices and in the munitions industries at the end of 1944 than would, in fact, be the case as a result of the War Cabinefs recentdecisions on the allocation of man-power in 1944. These two factorswould probably balance one another, so that it would not be justifiable to assume that the figures in the Report of the demobilisation Committee substantially under-estimated thenumbers of men available for demobilisation within fifteen monthsafter the end of the war with Germany.- The Minister of Labour and National Service said that the term &quot; demobilisation &quot; was associated in people&apos;s minds with theend of the war, and should not be applied to releases of men fromthe Services before the end of the war with Japan. This suggestionmet with general approval.On the question of block releases, the Minister of Labour and national Service pointed out that numbers of men had beencompulsorily directed during the war from one industry to another,for example, from the building to the steel industry. If a man whohad been so directed later joined the Army, he would be shown inthe Army records as having entered the Army from the steelindustry. A system of block releases based on Army records was thus liable to give rise to grievances.The Minister of Labour and &quot;National Service saw serious difficulty in a scheme which gave preference for overseas serviceonly to men who were actually overseas at the time the war withGermany came to an end. He cited the case of the divisions whichhad been all through the fighting in North Africa from Alamein toTunis and which had recently been brought back to this country.The President of the Board of Trade said that as regards the demobilisation of key men for industry, he was prepared to accept in principle the recommendations in the Committee^ Report; andwould do his best to see that the most urgent needs were met withinthe limits of the 2 per cent, suggested in the Report. He felt bound,however, to warn the War Cabinet that these numbers might notbe sufficient to meet all urgent needs; and, if that proved to be thecase, he might have to bring the matter up again.The Minister of Labour and National Service thought that atthe end of the war with Germany the best plan would be to releaseas quickly as possible from the Services the total number of menwho could be spared. Thereafter responsibility should lie with theMinistry of Labour to allocate the men to jobs in which they were most needed.[26563]
The Board of Trade would require considerable additional labour, as soon as the Avar with Germany was over, for the home civil market and for the export industry. This might be met inpart at least by the transfer of women labour from munitionsindustry to civil employment. This would be a temporary measure,pending the release of sufficient men from the forces. Clearly,however, a scheme of this kind assumed the continuance of thesystem of allocating man-power between Departments and thecontinued use of some, at least, of the existing powers to direct labour. He envisaged the Man-power Division of his Departmentcontinuing to operate as at present but with the engine in reverse.Building. Discussion then turned to the post-war needs of the buildingindustry.The Minister of Works said that at the end of the war withGermany the number of craftsmen in the building industry was likely to be only 170,000 (as compared with 500,000 before the war),and of these 130,000 would be employed on essential maintenance work. This meant that during the first two years after the endof the war in Europe we should not be able to build more than130.000 houses. He recognised the force of the arguments againstthe adoption of any system of block releases; but he wondered whether the Services would not be willing to accept the position if they could be assured that the men released early for return tothe building trade Would be employed wholly On the constructionof houses for occupation by ex-Service men.The Secretary of Slate for Scotland supported this proposal.He emphasised the effect on public morale of a failure to provide adequate housing accommodation for men returning from theForces.The President of the Board of Trade said that it would be unreasonable to apply to housebuilding all the available resourcesof the building industry in the first few years after the end of thewar. A small amount of building labour would be required for essential industrial work, e.g., the adaptation of war factories to peace-time production. He hoped, therefore, that it might bepossible by some means to increase the volume of building labour available during this period.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that hehad been considering how additional building labour might be madeavailable without recourse to a system of block releases. There were now in the building industry 19,000 men whose call-up to the forces had been deferred in order that urgent military works might becompleted. He believed that the majority of these were over 36 yearsof age and, even if they were called up, it was unlikely that&quot; theywould participate in active military operations in 1944. He might,therefore, be able to refrain from calling up about 15,000 of these(who would, for the most part; be craftsmen over 36 years of age)if he transferred them to other industries and withdrew acorresponding number of young men from those industries into theForces. This would ease the position, since the 15,000 from thebuilding industry could be transferred back into that industrywithout delay at the end of the war.It was agreed that this scheme merited further examination.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was anxious aboutthe position in the building industry. He understood that theMinister of Works had assumed that the amount of labour and materials devoted to maintenance and repair after the end of thewar with Germany would be cut down to a minimum. It was clear,however, that there would be great competition for labour and materials for delayed maintenance and reconstruction. The presentsystem, which depended on injunctions to the public not to have such work done unless absolutely necessary, together with amaximum of  100, above which a certificate was necessary, would
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,dth December, 1943.be insufficient to avoid a serious inflation of prices in the conditionswhich would exist after the end of the war with Germany. Itwould be very difficult to devise adequate measures to deal with thismatter. An Official Committee had been appointed to enquire into it.On the wider question of new house construction, he thoughtthat, unless the country was satisfied that this problem was being dealt with on a really adequate scale, there was a risk of politicaltrouble at least as serious as any likely to result from dissatisfactionin the Forces with the scheme of demobilisation.Reference was made to the use of military labour for construc-tion work. The Secretary of State for War thought that militaryconstruction companies could be employed, under military control,on such tasks as the removal of huts and their re-erection on othersites to serve as temporary accommodation.The Minister of Labour and National Service hoped that, ata later stage, when the peak of the military demands had. been easedand before Germany had been defeated, it might be possible to usesome construction companies on urgent clearing-up work.Other Matters. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security referredto the suggestion in paragraph 33 of the Report of the Demobilisa-tion Committee (W.P. (43) 494) that arrangements should be madefor the early return from the Forces of the 15,000 regular policemennow on military service. This had not been challenged by theService Departments, and he hoped that it might be accepted eventhough it were decided not to authorise any other block releases.The President of the Board of Education said that the educational proposals now before the House could not be carriedout unless he obtained an early return from the forces of the teachersnow on military service.A decision on these claims was deferred.The Minister of State said that the Foreign Office was facedwith the same problem as that outlined in the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies, although on a smaller scale.When the war with Germany ended, it would be essential to havea new intake into the Foreign Service to cope with the greatlyincreased work. The numbers involved, however, would not amountto more than 50 or 60 in the first year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was not makinga claim on behalf of the home Civil Service, but that, in his view,as good a case could be made out for that Service as for the colonial and Foreign Services.The Secretary of State for War said that in the Debate in theHouse-of Commons on the previous day it had become clear that opinion generally expected that after the defeat of Germany (a) conscription of the 18 year-olds should continue; and(b) some of the younger men who were now reserved, shouldbe called up.The War Cabinet (1) agreed to resume the discussion early in the following week;(2) invited the Minister of Reconstruction to focus the sugges-tions which had been put forward in discussion in regardto the building industry.
