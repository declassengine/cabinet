M e diterr an e anTheatre.naval operations.Naval, Military 1. The Vice-Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events ofand Air the previous week.Operations. The weather had been generally unfavourable.  Only two major(Previous operations had been carried out, one by some 400 aircraft againstReference: Berlin, and the other by some 450 aircraft against Leipzig. EnemyW.M. (43) 163rd efforts to improve the defences of Berlin had resulted in steadilyConclusions, increasing losses as our attacks had continued. The attack againstMinute l.)      Leipzig appeared to have been concentrated and very effective.Air Operations. The United States Air Force had made one heavy attack againstHome Theatre. Bremen and attacks on two other days on Sollingen in the Ruhr.Fighter Command and Tactical Air Force flew 3,070 sorties.Two squadrons of Typhoons, on a sweep over Holland, hadintercepted and destroyed 11 Do. 217 bombers for no loss.   enemy activity had been negligible.Due to improving weather, Allied activity had increasedgreatly, nearly 9,000 sorties have been made during the past week,mostly in support of the land battle. United States Fortresses had attacked the Fiat motor works at Turin and the submarine pens atMarseilles.In an attack by about 30 enemy aircraft on Bari, an ammunitionship had been blown up. The damage had spread rapidly. In allseventeen ships, totalling 70,000 tons, had been sunk (of which threemight be salvaged) and casualties had been heavy.Shipping losses for the week by enemy action had been two ships, totalling 10,000 tons, and belated reports had come in of fiveothers, totalling 24,000 tons. These figures did not include losses atBari. Total losses by enemy action for the month of November hadtotalled 132,000 tons.A second convoy had arrived safely in North Russian portswithout incident.After a week&apos;s hard fighting, the Eighth Army offensive had gained between 7 and 9 miles and an important breach had beenmade in the Germans&apos; winter positions on the lower Sangro. The2nd New Zealand Division had been engaged in heavy fighting andhad been forced to withdraw slightly as a result of German counter-attacks. Very heavy rain had fallen on the 4th December, resulting in a temporary 6-foot rise in the Sangro. The weather had laterimproved and bridging behind the leading troops was proceeding satisfactorily.After a heavy bombardment, the Fifth Army, strongly supported-by air forces, had attacked in the west, advancing up to two miles in mountainous country.Owing to a relaxation of German pressure in Yugoslavia, the partisans had been able to recover several towns and effectively toattack railways in the north.During the week, ground and weather conditions had been badand had slowed up operations, but the Russians had continued tomake some progress in the Gomel area. It was unlikely that major operations would be undertaken until the ground began to harden normally from mid-December onwards, in the central and southernsectors.MilitaryOperations.Italy.Balkans.Russia.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.[26559]
Royal Canadian 2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theNavy. First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (43) 542), proposing that proposed Trans-we should make a formal offer to hand over to Canada, as a freefer of Cruisers gift, 2 &quot;Fiji&quot; Class cruisers and 2 modern fleet destroyers, aand Fleet request for the transfer of which had been made by the CanadianDestroyers.      Government.(Previous The First Lord of the Admiralty said that there was some reference: indication that the Canadian Government would welcome a formalW.M. (43) 47th offer of these ships as a gift.Minute^T&apos; ^ ^e Chancettor 0f Mie Exchequer said that he concurred in thissuggestion.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal that we should make a formal offer to hand over these ships to the Canadian Government asa gift.Education. 3.   The War Cabinet continued their discussion of the draft(Previous        Education Bill,  and had before them a Memorandum by the reference:       President of the Board of Education (W.P. (43) 554) about threeW.M. (43) 165th points which he had undertaken to consider further : Conclusions,Minute 2.)       (a) Title of the Minister.The President of the Board of Education said that he nowproposed to include in Part I of the Bill, provision whereby theMinistry of Education would continue to have the title of &quot; Boardof Education&quot; (although the Board itself would be abolished), andthe Minister would continue to have the title of &quot; President of theBoard of Education.&quot;This proposal was approved.(b) Recovery of Cost of Meals.At the last meeting of the War Cabinet it had been suggestedthat the most satisfactory course would be to omit from the presentEducation Bill all provisions in regard to school meals.The President of the Board of Education said that this coursewould have obvious advantages; but if the future of school meals and milk had not been settled (in connection with the Governmentsscheme for children&apos;s allowances) by the 1st April, 1945, anamending Bill providing for the continuation of these services wouldbe necessary. Moreover, it had been specifically stated in the white paper on Educational Reconstruction that the present power oflocal authorities to provide meals and milk would be converted intoa duty. He accordingly suggested that the position should be met by the substitution for clause 48 of the Education Bill of a clauseon the following lines : &quot; It shall be the duty of the Local Education Authority tomake provision for the supply to children and young personsin attendance at County Schools, auxiliary schools, nurseryschools, special schools and young people&apos;s colleges of meals and milk to such extent and subject to such conditions(including directions as to the recovery or non-recovery of thecost) as may be directed by order of the Minister.&quot;Clause 50 would then remain as at present drafted, and a new clause in regard to recovery of cost in respect of boarding accom-modation and clothing only would be substituted for the existingclause 51.The War Cabinet-Agreed that this matter should be dealt with in the mannernow proposed by the President,
(c) Duties of Teachers in Relation to School Meals.At the last meeting of the War Cabinet, objection had been raised to clause 49 (2) which provided that no teacher should berequired to perform any services in connection with the preparationor serving of meals for pupils, except those for supervising theservice of such meals and the conduct of the pupils thereat.The President of the Board of Education explained that thepresent position was governed by section 85 of the Education Act,1921, which read as follows : &quot; No teacher seeking employment or employed in a public elementary school shall be required, as. part of his duties, to supervise or assist, or to abstain from supervising or assisting,in the provision of meals, or in the collection of the costthereof.&quot;He thought that some provision in regard to this matter wouldhave to be included in the new Bill, and, after consideration, he wasin favour of retaining clause 49 (2) as at present drafted.It was the view of the War Cabinet that any conditionswhich it might be necessary to impose, regarding the employmentof teachers in connection with school meals, could more suitablybe laid down by order of the Minister.The President of the Board of Education accordingly agreedto delete clause 49 (2) of the Bill and to insert in the new clause 48a form of words which would enable him to deal with the matter in this way.The remaining clauses of the Bill (see .H.P.C. (43) 136 andW.P. (43) 540) were then discussed, and the President of the Boardof Education gave further information and explanations in regardto a number of matters.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the Education Bill in the form of the draft attached to H.P.C. (43) 136, subject to the amendmentsagreed upon at their present meeting, at their meetingon the 2nd December, 1943, and at the meeting of theLegislation Committee on the 30th November, 1943, andto any further minor or drafting alterations whichmight be found to be necessary.(2) Took note that the President of the Board of Education,would introduce the Bill into the House of commons during the course of the following week; and agreed thatarrangements should be made for the second reading totake place as soon as possible after the Christmas recess.(3) Agreed that the following Ministers should be asked to back the Bill :-The Prime Minister.The Lord President of the Council.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Minister of Labour and National Service.The Minister of Health.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.Reinstatement 4. The Minister of Labour and National Service said that thein Civil discussions on this Bill with industrial representatives would makeEmployment it impossible for him to submit the Bill to the Legislation CommitteeBill. before Parliament rose for the Christmas recess.   He was anxious that the Bill should be read a second time as soon as possible afterParliament reassembled after the recess. In the circumstances, he asked authority to give formal notice of the introduction of the bill before the recess. This would mean a rather longer intervalthan usual between the formal introduction and the date of printing
and circulation of the Bill, which would take place towards theend of the recess. But in the special circumstances, and as theprinciples of the Bill had been approved, he thought that this course was justified.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed.Trade Disputes 5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, soon after theand Trade Union of Post Office Workers had withdrawn their application forUnions Act, affiliation to the T.U.C., the representatives of the Civil Service1927. Unions had expressed the hope that they might have a further(Previous        meeting with the Prime Minister at an early date.   Other preoccu-Reference:       pations had hitherto prevented this meeting; and he was advisedW.M. (43) 113th that there was some unrest, and also a risk that it might be thoughtConclusions,     that the Government was pursuing a delaying policy in this matter.Minute 4.)       In the circumstances, he thought that it would be helpful if a letterwere sent by the Prime Ministers Private Secretary to explain thereasons why it had not been possible to arrange a further meeting,and to say that it might be helpful if representatives of the unions were to submit a somewhat more specific statement as to what theymeant by &quot; industrial affiliation.&quot;   In view of the political implications-tions, however, he thought it right to bring this matter before theCabinet.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet endorsed theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s suggestion.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,Qth December, 1943.
