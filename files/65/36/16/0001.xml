The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.The operations of Bomber Command and of the United states air Force had been hampered by fog.&apos; Photographs of the Kasselraid a week earlier had shown that the whole of the centre of thetown had been devastated and that the effect on production mustbe considerable. During October Bomber Command had dropped13,773 tons of bombs and the United States Air Force 4,120 tons.Coastal Command had made three attacks on U-boats duringthe past week and had possibly damaged 2 of them. The opera-tions of Fighter Command had also suffered from fog. Losses, forthe week had been 6 fighters, 3 Tactical Air Force bombers,2 Coastal Command aircraft and 1 bomber. Enemy losses had been5 aircraft destroyed. During the month of October 230 enemy aircraft had raided this country at night, of which 17 had been destroyed.Italian railways behind the German lines and Genoa had been bombed with considerable success. A number of small enemy vessels had been damaged in the Adriatic and the ^aegean. Enemy losses in this theatre had been 82 destroyed (41 on the ground), 10 probably destroyed and 78 damaged.   Allied losses amounted to 55 aircraft.Rabaul and Kahili had both been heavily attacked. 238 (93 onthe ground) Japanese aircraft had been claimed as destroyed during the previous week as against 10 Allied.Shipping losses by enemy action, including belated reports,during the previous week amounted to 11,700 tons.

There were indications that the enemy meant to fall back to prepared positions on the line of the River Sangro.All Russian bridgeheads in the Kiev area had been held. AtKrivoi Rog heavy German counter-attacks had been held by theRussians. A considerable advance had been made southwards fromDneipropetrovsk. South of the Dneiper the Russians, afterturning the Germans out of Melitopol, had made a big advance,averaging 10 miles a day for the last seven days, and nowthreatened Perekop and the last exit by land from the Crimea.There had been some indications that the Germans were endeavouring to evacuate equipment by sea.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.[26369-1]
moscow conference.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 145thConclusions,Minute 3.)- 2. The Prime Minister said that great results had been achieved at the Moscow Conference. Agreement had been reached on the Declaration of Italy, the Declaration on Austria, theDeclaration on Atrocities and on the Declaration on general security. This last Declaration would now be signed by China aswell as the three Powers represented at Moscow, and would therefore be a Declaration of the four nations.On all these matters the results of the Conference would bepublished to the world that evening. No solution had been reached on the Polish question, but he had no doubt that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs would be able to report on his return theextent of the progress made.The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet particulars of one further matter dealt with at the Moscow Conference. This is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.The War Cabinet asked that a telegram should be sent to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs warmly congratulating him&apos; on his part in the successful results of this Conference.Lease-Lend.Reciprocal aid to the UnitedStates.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 146thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The War Cabinet were informed that the United states administration now hoped that we would publish our proposed white Paper on reciprocal aid. (See telegram No. 4909 from washington.) This, of course, was a complete reversal of the pointof view reported to us on the 21st October. (See Appendix toW.P. (43) 477.)It also appeared that the enquiry by the Senate was directednot to fundamental principles, but rather to discover whether anyscandals existed in the way lease-lend was administered.It was also contemplated that the President might comment onour White Paper in-a special report to Congress on Lease-Lend, butit was not yet certain whether he would take this course.In these circumstances, the way was now open for us to publishour White Paper.The question was raised in discussion whether the White Paperrequired redrafting, from the point of view of its impact on publicopinion in the United States. The Lord Privy Seal had asked theTreasury for some further details before submitting his suggestions for the reshaping of the document, in accordance with the arrange-ments made at the last meeting.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the presenttext of the White Paper had been agreed with the United states administration, and that amendments had been made to meet theirviews, in the direction of writing down the original draft. Itwould therefore be necessary to consult the United States Govern-ment again if the Paper was to be further revised.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to consider the.,drafting revisions submitted by the Lord Privy Seal.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.London Airfield 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretaryfor Transport of State for Air (W.P. (43) 482) proposing the establishment of a.Services. new  airfield   near   London,  capable  of  accommodating  heavytransport aircraft of the latest type. The site suggested included,but extended beyond, the Heath Row Airfield near Staines. the project was intended, in the first instance, to satisfy the military needs of Transport Command, but could be developed further afterthe War, so as to provide an international civil air port.
Indian sterling balances.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 145thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that theCommittee on Indian Financial Questions were making progress with the matters remitted to them. On inflation, a report had beenreceived from the Government of India, setting out various steps which could be taken to combat it. It would, however, be necessarythat there should be a technical examination to make sure how farpractical effect could be given to these measures, and a Sub-Committee was being appointed for this purpose.The Committee had reached the conclusion that the growth of sterling balances was largely due to the automatic result of India&apos;sfavourable trade balance. Examination was taking place to see howfar this balance had been swollen unnecessarily by purchases atinflated prices. The statement in the Report circulated to theCommittee on Indian Financial Questions which implied that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had purchased petrol at 3s. 2d. a gallon nowproved to have been a mistake; and it had been ascertained that theprice charged to His Majesty&apos;s Government was, in fact, Is. 5d. a gallon.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also pointed out that the debtin question was the amount due not to the Indian Government, butto the Reserve Bank of India, and represented the security behind the greatly expanded rupee currency.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped to submit a full report on these very technical matters before long.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,1st November, 1943.131 W.M. 148 (43).The War Cabinet-Remitted the Memorandum, for enquiry and report, to thefollowing group of Ministers :-Lord President of the Council (in the Chair),Chancellor of the Exchequer,Minister of Production,Lord Privy Seal,Secretary of State for Air,Minister of Health,Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,Minister of War Transport,Minister of Town and Country Planning, and paymaster-General.

At the meeting of the War Cabinet on Monday, 1stNovember, the Prime Minister proposed that an announcement should be made in Secret Session in the House of Commons onthe following day of the chain of events connected with theGerman long-range rocket.     The course of proceedings is setout in the annexed &quot;no circulation&quot; rninute0About 11 p.m. that night 1 was summoned to the PrimeMinister&apos;s room in the Annex,     There were present LordBeaverbrook, Lord Cherwell, the Chief Whip, Mr. DuncanSandys and the Minister of Information..     The Prime ministers aid that after the meeting of the Cabinet the matter hadbeen further discussed in the ante-room, when Sir john anderson had expressed himself as strongly sceptical about thewhole business.     The view had also been very strongly expressed that there were considerable disadvantages inmaking a statement on the matter to the House in secret session^     The Prime Minister said that he wished the wholebusiness to be looked at again by the War Cabinet and gavedirections that a meeting should be held on the following morning.This was duly arranged, but owing to the business of theHouse (income Tax - Pay-as-you-Earn) the Chancellor of theExchequer was not able to be present.In the circumstances I cancelled the record of theproceedings in the Cabinet on Monday night and included inthe minutes on Tuesday a very short record, only   of theproceedings.      The attached &quot;no circulation&quot; notes give af\iller account of what was said on these two occasions.

NO circulation.M.(43)148TH CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Record(1st November, 1943 - 5.30 p.in.)THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinet that,in accordance with the decision arrived at by the DefenceCommittee at their meetings on the 28th October,  it was proposed   to give the House of Commons, in Secret session on the following day, a statement of the chain of eventsconnected with the German Long-Range Rocket and the steps which had been taken in the last six months to find out about it and to deal with it.     After the fullestand most prolonged enquiry, it seemed that a rocketcapable of reaching London was scientifically possible and, in the circumstances, although there was no evidence which would justify a statement that an attack was likely,he was sure that the right course was to tell the Houseof Commons.     He thought that it would be convenient thata corresponding statement in the house of Loi^ds shouldbe made by the Lord Privy Seal, who had been concernedi n the se enquiries.The question was raised whether the AlliedGovernments in London (other than the United StatesGovernment, to whom particulars had already been furn-ished) should be informed of the position.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that this should notbe done at the present time.The question was also raised whether it would benecessary for a further communication to be made to thePress,THE WAR CABINET were informed that the Minister ofInformation and the Home Secretary and Minister of home security had already seen the Editors and that it would be unnecessary to make any further communications to them\xntil a little later on.It was decided that it would be undesirable tomake any cojmmxnication to the ptiblic at this Juncture.There was no reason to suppose that an attack by this method was imminent.     Moreover, any statement to the general public of this country would be of assistance to the enemy,who were sustaining the morale of their people by the expectation that a new form of attack would shortly be launched On this country.THE WAR CABINET took note with approval of these statements.x   D.O.(43)10th Meeting.the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
