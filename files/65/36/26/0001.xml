Palestine. 1.   The  War  Cabinet considered  a  Memorandum  by theSpecial Force Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (43) 510) seeking approvalof MoDile for the establishment in Palestine of a special force of mobile PolicePolice. with a strength of 2,000 British officers and other ranks.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that this proposal had been put forward by the High Commissioner for Palestine withthe strong support of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, theMinister of State Resident in the Middle East and the Middle EastWar Council. All the British authorities on the spot were agreedthat, even if the situation were held meanwhile, disorder was likelyto break out in Palestine immediately after the end of the war withGermany; and at that critical period nearly two-thirds of themembers of the existing British Police force were due to leave-Palestine.The establishment of this Force was not likely, to be popularwith either Jews or Arabs; but it would be difficult for them tomaintain strong objection to a measure designed to offer a greaterguarantee of local security.Points in discussion were : -(a) The Secretary of State for War endorsed the proposal. Hethought it unsafe to place too much reliance on military support forthe preservation of public order in Palestine-partly because thetroops stationed in the neighbourhood might not be suitable forthese duties (e.g., there were objections to using Indian troops forthis purpose) and partly because military needs were likely to havethe result that&apos; troops in this theatre were scattered in relatively... , small contingents.(6)/It had originally been proposed that this Force should be constituted as a &quot; Gendarmerie.&quot; The Secretary of State for theColonies said that the Force would form an integral part of thePalestine Police, under the administrative control of the civil government, but, like the remainder of the Palestine Police, underthe operational control of the General Officer Commanding,Palestine. He thought it would be preferable, for political reasons,to avoid the use of the term &apos;&apos; Gendarmerie&apos;&apos;; and he proposedthat the new Force should be established, and known, as a &quot; mobilesection of the Palestine Police.&quot;The War Cabinet agreed that it was important that this force should be, and should appear, an integral part of the PalestinePolice.(c) The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that one ofthe recommendations made in the Report of an Economy Committeewhich had been at work in Palestine was for a reduction in thestrength of the Jewish Settlement Police.   The High Commissioneragreed that such a reduction was justified on grounds both of economy and of security.  The Secretary of State felt, however, thati    ;,.  he would be exposed to strong criticism from the Jewish Communityif he proceeded simultaneously with a reduction in the strength ofthe Jewish Settlement Police and the establishment of a mobilei i     section of the Palestine Police.    If his present proposal were approved, he thought it would be necessary to postpone any1 - ;.:   reduction of the Jewish Settlement Police.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while recognising that ito would be inexpedient to announce the two proposals simultaneously,asked that the recommendations  of  the Economy   Committee&apos;i*iri.*    i        regarding the Jewish Settlement Police should be considered on;-.--!   their merits,   the Secretary of State for the Colonies undertook toi-i- discuss this point with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal, outlined in W.P. (43) 510, for theestablishment of a mobile section of the Palestine Police.
187W,.M. 1S8 (43).Newfoundland. 2. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the(Previous Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (43) 507) and by the reference: Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (43) 523) about the policy that should beW.M. (43) 40th adopted with regard to the constitutional problem in Newfoundland.Conclusions, The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, in his memo-Minute 3.)       randum, suggested that our policy should be based on the following main points : (a) there should be no change in the present form of Govern-while the war lasts;(b) as soon as practicable after the end of the war in Europe,we must provide machinery for enabling the newfoundland people to examine the situation and toexpress their considered views as to the form of govern-ment they desire, having regard to the financial andeconomic conditions prevailing at the time;(c) if the general wish of the people should be for a return to full responsible government, we for our part shall bevery ready, if the Island is then self-supporting, to. , facilitate such a change;(d) if, however, the general wish should be either for thecontinuance of the present form of government or forsome change of system which would fall short of fullresponsible government, we shall be prepared to examinesuch proposals sympathetically, and consider withinwhat limits the continued acceptance of responsibility bythe United Kingdom could be recommended toParliament;(e) in the meantime, a vigorous attempt should be made to pushon with the development of local government, on whichthe members of the recent Parliamentary Mission havemade some interesting recommendations, as well as withgeneral reconstruction plans. Every effort should bemade to encourage the development of local Governmentinstitutions, which would afford a base for an effectivecentral Government.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs also proposedthat a declaration of policy on the above lines should be made onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government when Dominion affairs came upfor discussion in the House of Commons during the Debate on the address.The Lord Privy Seal, in his memorandum, suggested thatdissatisfaction with the present position in Newfoundland was growing rapidly, and that Newfoundland should be offered the rightto resume Dominion status at any time during the war or after it,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, in his view, it was clear that no step could be taken to change the present. form of government during the war. The present economicconditions in the country were abnormal, and were due to suchcauses as the creation in Newfoundland of the large operationalbases. These conditions might change after the war. Further, therewas no reason to suppose that the people of Newfoundland wanted achange during the war, nor, indeed, could any time be moreinappropriate to make such changes.Nevertheless, the visits of his predecessor, and of the three members of Parliament, had given rise to some expectation of anearly announcement, and there was a good deal of speculation about his Majesty&apos;s Governments intentions. He was, therefore, infavour of a statement being made which would make clear to thepeople of Newfoundland the issues involved. Every opportunity should be taken of educating public opinion in Newfoundland.The Lord Privy Seal said that he spoke with considerableknowledge of Newfoundland. He thought that it was not the case that the island&apos;s prosperity was unlikely to continue.   It had great[26455-2] B 2
natural resources, the value of which, had been increased as a resultof the war. There was a good deal of discontent in the island withthe Commission. He referred to the fact that the. threeNewfoundland members of the Commission had always been chosenfrom members of the local Conservative Party. The newspapersprovided evidence of rising discontent. The only way to teach thepeople how to govern themselves was to give them self-government.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he couldnot accept the view that there was unanimity in Newfoundland infavour of self-government. He quoted from the reports (compiledseparately) of the three Members of Parliament. All bore out thestatement that the one point on which there was unanimity wasthat there should be no constitutional change during the war. TheSecretary of State also disputed the statements in paragraphs and 7 of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s memorandum. He also pointed outthat the Report of the Royal Commission, which had been acceptedby His Majesty&apos;s Government, had included the following statement: &quot; It would be understood that, as soon as the island&apos;difficulties are overcome and the island is again self-supporting,a responsible Government, on request from the people,, of new foundland, would be restored.&quot;This statement had been included among certain extracts fromthe report which had constituted the Annex to the First Scheduleto the Newfoundland Act of 1933.The Deputy Prime Minister said that one of the difficulties ofthe position was that the Royal Commission&apos;s. Report spoke of therequest of the people of Newfoundland, but made no provision asto how this request should be expressed. Rather over a year ago hehad spent ten days in Newfoundland. The impression which he had then formed had been entirely confirmed by the reports of the three members of Parliament. Hardly anybody in Newfoundland, wanted to go back to the position as it had existed before the RoyalCommission^ Report. While, they might not altogether like theCommission form of government, they had not liked their own government, and they seemed to look forward to a state of affairs in which self-government would be restored, but this country would retain some measure of control over their finances.It was significant that there was almost no local government,in the island and a new system of education was needed. He agreed generally  with the view expressed by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, and thought it important that the method ofobtaining an expression of the people&apos;s opinion after the war shouldbe very carefully worked out. In the meantime steps should be. takento educate opinion in Newfoundland. There was much to be said for getting public men and officials from Newfoundland to come overto this country to see how our institutions were run.Reference was also made to the suggestion put forward byMr. A. P. Herbert, M.P., that a National Convention should beset up after the war, composed of representatives of all classes and interests in Newfoundland to discuss the form of government tobe recommended. The view was expressed that a scheme on theselines might have considerable advantages and that the project waswell worth examination.The possible union of Newfoundland with Canada was referredto. The Lord Privy Seal said that there was no possibility that thiswould come about.Discussion then turned on the terms of the outline of policy,given by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs inparagraph 10 of his memorandum (and summarised under (a) to (e)at the beginning of this Minute). The view was expressed bythe Minister of Labour and National Service and the Secretaryof State for A ir thai, this language might be made somewhat more precise.   A number of suggestions to this end were discussed.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,19th November, 1943.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved generally the line of policy proposed by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs in his memo-randum (W.P. (43) 507).(2) Agreed that the statement of policy set out in paragraph 10of that memorandum should be amended on the following lines : (i) In the forefront it should be stated that we had given an undertaking in 1933 that, as soon as the island&apos;s difficulties had been overcome and thecountry was again self-supporting, responsible government, on request from the people of new foundland, would be restored. Our wholepolicy was governed by this undertaking,(ii) There should, however, be no change in the present form of government while the war lasted.(iii) As soon as practicable after the end of the warmachinery must be provided to enable the peopleof Newfoundland to examine the future of the island and to express their considered views asto the form of government they desire, havingregard to the financial and economic conditions prevailing at the time.In the meantime the Secretary of State wouldtake soundings in order to ascertain what kindof machinery would be acceptable to the newfoundland people.(iv) If the general wish of the people should be for a return to full responsible government, we for our part shall be very ready, if the island is then self-supporting, to facilitate such a change,(v) If, however, the general wish should be either forthe continuance of the present form of govern-ment or for some change of system which would fall short of full responsible government, we shallbe prepared to examine such proposalssympathetically and consider within what limits the continued acceptance of responsibility by theUnited Kingdom could be recommended toParliament.(vi) In the meantime, a vigorous attempt should be madeto push on with the development of local govern-ment, on which the members of the Mission havemade some interesting recommendations, as wellas with general reconstruction plans. Every effort should be made to encourage the development oflocal Government institutions, which would afford a base for an effective central Government.(3) Agreed that an early opportunity should be taken for astatement on the above lines to be made on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.
