The Lebanon. 1.   The War Cabinet met to consider the situation resulting(Previous from the action taken by the French in the Lebanon.  M. Helleu had reference: dissolved the Chamber by decree, arrested the President of theW.M. (43) 89th Republic and all the members of the Cabinet except two or three,Conclusions, surrounded with French forces the Chamber, where there were minute 3.) still 400 Deputies, and appointed Emir Edde, a notorious drug-trafficker, as head of the State and head of the Government.The Secretary of State Jor Foreign Affairs said that matters were made worse by the fact that the French had taken this action without prior consultation with us. Indeed, such information asthey had given us before the event had been deliberately false.Telegrams showed thai: the reaction throughout the Middle east was very serious.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added that he had sent a telegram to the Resident Minister, Algiers, instructing himto leave the French Government in absolutely no doubt that we regarded their action as wholly indefensible. We had also madetwo requests : the first for the replacement of M. Helleu, the secondfor the release of the politicians who had been seized in the Lebanon.Mr. Macmillan had also been instructed to make it clear that, unless we received this satisfaction immediately, we should be compelledto take a line which would certainly imply dissociating ourselvescompletely from the French, and might well entail consequences which would be most unpleasing to them. (Telegram 2599 toAlgiers.)On the general situation, the Deputy Minister of State resident in the Middle East said that we had had warnings for some time past that the French methods in Syria might land us in serious difficulties. He pointed out that our own credit was deeplyinvolved, since when we had occupied Syria we had proclaimed,jointly with the French, that the Lebanon and Syria would beSovereign independent States from that moment onwards.Discussion ensued on the question whether we should add tothe demands already made on the French by asking not only thatthe Lebanese politicians who had been seized should be released, butthat the Lebanese Government should be restored. It was urgedthat this ought to be done in order to restore the position which had existed before the French had acted by force against the Governmentof the Lebanon.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, as we had alreadytabled our demands on the French National Committee, we should, weaken our position if we added a further demand before we hadreceived an answer to the requests which we had made. This viewmet with general support in the War Cabinet. It was felt that, evenif the requests which we had already made were refused, we would still be able to increase our demands when we restated them.Discussion then turned on the measures we might take if ourdemands were refused. One course would be to make it clear that,if our demands were not complied with, we should withdraw ourrecognition of the French National Committee. A second coursewould be to use our troops to restore order and secure communica-tions and vital military interests in the Lebanon.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read to the WarCabinet an appreciation of the situation received from general wilson (C.I.C. 1166 of the 11th November). He added that therewere British formations available in the Middle East which couldbe used in the Lebanon if necessary. In present circumstances thesecurity of communications in Syria and the Lebanon was animportant military interest.The War Cabinet were also informed that the Minister ofState Resident  in  the Middle  East had sent  a  telegram  toSir Edward Spears telling him that he was not prepared to give. authority for the British to proclaim martial law and to take overthe Government.
BeliefConference.(previous reference:W.M. (43), 143rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Assumption byColonelLlewellin of his appointment as  minister ofFood.2. T.he Minister of Production said that Colonel Llewellin was at present leading the United Kingdom Delegation in America onthe subject of UNRRA, and was anxious to remain there until his business was concluded. This would delay the taking up by him ofhis appointment as Minister of Food. The Prime Minister had agreed to the proposal, subject to the approval of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet signified their assent to Colonel Llewellin&apos;proposal.Leakage of 3.   The War Cabinet had a discussion upon the alleged leakageInformation.      of certain information.   A record is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,12th November, 1943.The War Cabinet took the view that, in the first instance, weshould pursue the former course, namely, to make it clear to theFrench National Committee that we were not prepared to continueto recognise them unless they complied with our demands. Weshould endeavour to avoid a situation in which we had to use Britishtroops to restore order in the Lebanon. At the same time, the WarCabinet recognised that, in the last resort, if all else failed, we might be driven to intervene.The War Cabinet also considered a draft telegram from thePrime Minister to the President, informing him of the situationand indicating the line which we proposed to pursue.General approval was expressed with the line proposed in thedraft telegram, subject to the omission of one paragraph.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was asked tosend a telegram to Mr. Macmillan, informing him thatthe War Cabinet had now considered the situation and fully endorsed the line of action taken by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in telegram No. 2599.Mr. Macmillan should also be informed that he might give an even more definite warning to the french national Committee as to the effect which failure tocomply with our demands would have on the con-tinuance of our relations with them.(2) Mr. Macmillan should also be invited to ascertain to what extent members of the French National Committee hadbeen parties to the action taken in the Lebanon, and toendeavour to secure the support of those members whohad not been a party to this action, in bringing pressure to bear in favour of compliance with our demands.(3) If the French National Committee refused to comply withour demands, they should be restated with the inclusionof a demand for the restoration of the Lebanon Govern-ment and the ejection of Emir Edde.(4) The Minister of State Resident in the Middle East shouldbe informed that we endorsed the decision which he had given that, for the present, British troops should not beused to restore order in the Lebanon.
