1. At their meeting on the 27th July the War Cabinet had approved the early publication of a White Paper putting Lend-Lease and Reciprocal Aid in the wider conception of contributions to a common pool for common purposes, and describing the range and estimated value of the reciprocal aid which we were giving notonly to the United States, but to Russia and other Allies. the presentation of this White Paper was to have been accompanied byan announcement that in future raw materials from this country,the Colonies and Southern Rhodesia would be given as reciprocal aid; and it was hoped that the United States Government wouldhave been able to conclude, and to announce simultaneously, similar arrangements with the Governments of the Dominions and India.At the last moment Mr. Morgenthau had asked that thepublication of the proposed White Paper should be postponed. this had been done, and the proposed declaration on raw materials had also been deferred.The War Cabinet now had before them Memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (43) 477) and the Minister ofState (W.P. (43) 478). In the former Memorandum it was explainedthat the question of publication had again been taken up with the Lend-Lease Administration, and that discussions had been pro-ceeding on the footing that publication would take place shortly.It now appeared, however, from telegrams recently received from washington (reproduced in the Appendix to W.P. (43) 477) thatthe United States Administration were again pressing that publica-fcion should be postponed. The United States Senate were to holdan investigation into Lend-Lease, and Mr. Stettinius desired that publication of the White Paper should be deferred until thatinvestigation had been completed. It was suggested in the telegramsthat Mr. Stettinius&apos;s view was shared by President Roosevelt andall the interested Departments of the United States Government.. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were variousindications that the United States Government were moving away from the conception of Lend-Lease and Reciprocal Aid as a pooling of resources for common purposes, and were seeking to justifyLend-Lease, as against political criticism in the United States, onthe basis that it was so administered as to safeguard United Statesinterests. In these circumstances he saw great clanger in allowing the British case on Lend-Lease to go by default; and he was most anxious to avoid any further long delay in the publication of theWhite Paper. Later on, as we got nearer the Presidential Election,the atmosphere was likely to become less favourable. He therefore&apos; recommended (i) That a telegram should at once be sent to Washingtonmaking it clear that we could not agree that the presen-tation of the White Paper should be delayed indefinitelyuntil the investigation by the United States Senate hadbeen completed,(ii) That we should aim at securing, simultaneously with the presentation of the White Paper, announcements aboutthe inclusion of raw materials in Reciprocal Aid.(iii) That at the same time the President of the Board of trade should announce that discussions were proceeding withthe United States Government with a view to the with-drawal of the White Paper on the use of Lend-Leasematerials for the purposes of the export trade.The Minister of State supported these recommendations. he emphasised the importance, from the point of view of Anglo-American relations, of persuading both the Administration and thepublic in the United States that Lend-Lease must be regarded not as a commercial proposition, but as a pooling of resources for acommon purpose.The President of the Board of Trade also supported the chancellors recommendations. The delaying tactics adopted by theUnited States authorities were causing serious embarrassment; and-1] b 2
he was most anxious to be able to make an early announcement about the discussions which were proceeding regarding the exporttrade^In discussion, there was general agreement about theimportance of securing that the British case on Lend-Lease was fully presented to the public, both in the United States and in thiscountry; and it was agreed that on this account the publication ofthe proposed White Paper could not be indefinitely delayed. doubts were, however, expressed about the wisdom of insisting onimmediate publication in face of the advice now given byMr. Stettinius. The issue was, in fact, one of timing. Those inAmerica who counselled further delay had in the past shown themselves most friendly to British interests; and it would be imprudent to act against their advice -at least until we knew more fully the reasons for their present attitude.The Prime Minister said that he would be prepared to send a personal message to President Roosevelt setting out our reasons forwishing to proceed with the publication of the White Paperwithout further delay and asking him to indicate, if he wishedpublication to be further delayed, what were his grounds for advising delay and what degree of importance he attached to them.On learning the Presidents views we could review the position and.decide finally what line of action should be taken. -Meanwhile, he thought that further consideration might with advantage be given to the terms of the draft White Paper. he recognised that the draft had been carefully considered by the interested Departments here and in the United States, and it wasno doubt a satisfactory document from the point of view of thosefully conversant with the technicalities of the subject. The primary purpose of the document was, however, to present the British case to the British and American people; and it was important that itshould be drawn up in the manner most likely to make the position clear to members of the general public.The Lord Privy Seal thought that the document should berecast with this in mind. He was invited to send to the Chancellorof the Exchequer his suggestions for reshaping the document.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Prime Minister to send, a personal message to president Roosevelt setting out our reasons for wishing to proceed, without further delay, with the publicationof the proposed White Paper on Lend-Lease andReciprocal Aid; with the announcement of the decisions to give raw materials from the British commonwealth as Reciprocal Aid; and with an announcement aboutthe discussions now proceeding with the United states authorities regarding Lend-Lease materials and theexport trade.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit to thePrime Minister a draft statement which might form thebasis of such a message to President Roosevelt.(3) Asked that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should considermeanwhile whether the draft White Paper required any modification to ensure that it would make our position clear to the British and American people.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, toinform the Australian Government of the approach which was being made to President Roosevelt, and topress them to reconsider their attitude regarding thesupply of raw materials, as Reciprocal Aid, to theUnited States. ;:
Post-WarAgriculturalPolicy.(previous reference:W.M. (43). 141stConclusions,-Minute 1.)Civil Aviation.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 137thConclusions,Minute 5.)future procedure.Points raised onthe Memoranda.3.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) A minute by the Lord Privy Seal addressed to the PrimeMinister (W.P. (43) 462) setting out the broad aims ofthe British Civil Air Transport policy and the findings of the British Commonwealth and Empire conversations,(ii) A joint Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal and Mr. C. D.Howe (W.P. (43) 481) which had been unanimously agreed at the final meeting of the British Common-wealth delegates.The Lord Privy Seal proposed that the Minister of war transport and himself should go to the United States, in the nearfuture, for discussions with representatives of the United StatesGovernment. But he did not intend to go until he had heard thatthe time was propitious for such a meeting. Meanwhile, he proposedto send an emissary to the United States who could take soundingsas to how opinion was forming in the United States on thesematters.After these discussions with the United States (in which it was hoped Mr. Howe would take part) it was proposed that there shouldbe an International Conference between representatives of thiscountry, the United States and the U.S.S.R., and possibly China.The French National Committee of Liberation had asked to senddelegates to this Conference, but he did not think that this shouldbe conceded.When agreement had been reached by the three, or possibly thefour, Great Powers, the way would then be open for a general international Conference, at which representatives of other nations would be invited to subscribe to the general basis of agreement reached in the preliminary discussions.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs referred to theposition of Newfoundland in relation to the Trans-Atlantic air route. At the moment Newfoundland^ Dominion status was, soto speak, in commission. Nevertheless, he thought it would benecessary, at the appropriate stage, that the Newfoundland Govern-inent should be brought into consultation on this matter.The following points were raised in regard to the terms of thetwo Memoranda before the War Cabinet : (a) The Secretary of State for Air referred to paragraph 2 of w.P. (43) 481, which stated that each Dominion, the UnitedKingdom and India should be invited to operate and assume responsibility for sections of the all-British route adjacent to theterritory of each.The literal interpretation of this paragraph might imply thatthe route would be sectionalised in such a way as to prevent the through-traffic of British aircraft over the whole route.2. At their Meeting on. the 15th October the War Cabinet had considered Agricultural Policy and had invited a committee consisting of The Lord President of the Council (Chairman),The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, andThe Paymaster-General,to draw up a draft Directive to guide the Agricultural ministers in their forthcoming discussions with representatives of theindustry.The War Cabinet now had before them a draft Directiveprepared by this Committee (W.P. (43) 474).After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Approved the draft Directive and invited the Agricul-tural Ministers to proceed on the basis set out therein,
The Minister of War Transport said that the matter had been expressed in this way so as to emphasise the responsibilities whichwould rest on each of the partners in the all-British route. It was,however, clearly understood that aircraft would be able to fly overeach of these routes from end to end.(6) The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the,Colonies had great interests in this matter, but he thought that thepoints of concern to him would not arise until the scheme came tobe worked out in detail. He had sent the Lord Privy Seal a note ofthe points he had in mind and he agreed with the general principlesstated in these two papers.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was nothing in these papers about the finance of civil air transport. he assumed that in any Convention drawn up at a later stage duesafeguards would be inserted against unreasonable competitionleading to heavy expenditure on subsidies.The Minister of War Transport said that this point had been and would be borne in mind. The four &quot; freedoms of the air &quot; setout on page 2 of W.P. (43) 462 would not come into existence unlessan international agreement was reached.The Lord Privy Seal outlined broadly the type of arrangements which he contemplated might come into existence. Air routes were contemplated running from London to Montreal, to Capetown, andto Sydney and Wellington. These might be shared by the UnitedKingdom Government and the Dominion (or Dominions) Govern-ments concerned on a 50-50 basis. Besides these routes, there wouldbe a route from Montreal to Trinidad which might be a Canadianresponsibility. A route was also contemplated from Australia viaShanghai and Alaska to Canada; this route depended upon theChinese, Russians and Americans making facilities available. TheAustralian and New Zealand Governments also hoped to run aroute, in co-operation with the United States, across the Pacific viaHonolulu. This would, of course, compete with the route just mentioned. The South African Government would probably alsowish to run a route from Capetown to Washington.All traffic in India, other than the through route from theUnited Kingdom to Australia and New Zealand, would be reservedfor India.The Lord Privy Seal said that he contemplated that we shouldmake an agreement with the United States Government in regardto the partition of the North Atlantic traffic on terms morefavourable to us than the agreement made before the war. In his view, it would be in our interests to make large concessions to theUnited States in regard to the South American traffic in return fortheir being willing to concede our claims in Europe, the Mediter-ranean and Africa.The Minister of State emphasised that our interests in civilaviation in Europe were far more than commercial. He hoped thatthe importance of civil aviation in Europe, from the point of viewof future security and the control of German aviation, would alsobe borne in mind.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the procedure proposed by theLord Privy Seal for further negotiations on Civil air transport.(2) Subject to the points raised in discussion, approved the-Memoranda before them (W.P. (43) 462 and 481).Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,27th October, 1943.
