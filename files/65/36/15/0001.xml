Italy- 2.   The War Cabinet had a discussion as to the future of theFuture of the    Italian Fleet.   The discussion and conclusions reached are recordedItalian Fleet.     in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions,n       (previous reference:W.M. (43) 134th _Conclusions,Minute 3.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (43) 471) regarding the treatmentof British prisoners of war in Siam; and a Memorandum by theMinister of State (W.P. (43) 484) on the question whether &quot;some improvement might be achieved by a systematic campaign of publicity disclosing Japanese treatment of prisoners of war and civilian internees in their hands.The Minister of State said that, on a balance of all the con-siderations outlined in his Memorandum, he recommended that a campaign of publicity should be used in the hope that it might force the Japanese to remedy these conditions. Negotiations were,however, proceeding for an exchange of civilian internees, and, toavoid prejudicing those negotiations, he recommended that the publicity campaign should not begin until an agreement for thisexchange had been concluded or, alternatively, until it was clearthat no such agreement would be reached. This should be clear bythe middle or end of January next. The interval could be used forthe purpose of discussing with the Governments of the UnitedStates, the Dominions. India, the Netherlands and other Allieshaving prisoners in Japanese hands (who would, in any event, haveto be consulted) the proposals for a systematic publicity campaign.Points in discussion were :- -(a) The Secretary of State for War feared that few of the prisoners now held by the Japanese in Siam would survive. reports which the Foreign Office regarded as reliable indicated that 4,000had already died, whereas the deaths officially notified by theJapanese totalled only about 100.(b) It was suggested that it might be helpful if the proposedpublicity stressed the extent to which the Siamese must be held responsible for the conditions obtaining within their territory.Fears for the future might have a greater influence on them thanon the Japanese.(c) The Commander-in-Chief, India, had been authorised tomaintain general anti-Japanese propaganda in India; but hadbeen asked to avoid references to Japanese treatment of prisonersuntil the arrangements for a systematic campaign of publicity onthis point had been concluded.The Prime Minister said that we should take all steps in our power to ensure the safety of the large number of British prisoners in Japanese hands, and should not be unduly deterred by the possible effect on the exchange of civil internees. It was, however, essentialthat we should keep in touch on this matter with the United States,since there were a very large number of United States prisoners in japanese hands. The first step, therefore, should be to consult theUnited States Government on the position, putting to them the gravity of the issues involved, and representing to them theadvantages which might be expected to follow from a publicity campaign.Japan.Treatment ofPrisoners ofWar.(previous reference:W.M.

Wage EarnersIncome Tax Bill.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 139thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that on theSecond Reading of this Bill he had promised, with the approval ofthe War Cabinet, to give sympathetic consideration to the possi-bility of including within its scope salaried workers in the lowerincome groups. During the Committee stage of the Bill, however,an unexpected demand had developed from all parts of the house that the new system should extend to all salaried persons withoutlimit of income. As the principle had already been admitted, itwould be difficult to resist the extension now demanded; and theV/hips advised that feeling in the House was so strong that, if theGovernment were unwilling to meet it, they might be defeated.The only practical difficulty in removing the income limitoriginally contemplated was that in certain cases in the higher1income groups transfer of income between Schedule D and schedule E opened up the possibility of tax evasion. If, therefore,the income limit were to be removed, drastic provisions would haveto be included to prevent this kind of evasion.Subject to the War Cabinet&apos;s approval, he proposed to holdinformal discussions with representatives of the various Parties inthe House of Commons, in which he would put the position to themfrankly, and would offer to extend the new system to all salariedworkers, without income limit, if he could be assured that the house would be ready to accept the consequential provisions which wouldbe necessary to prevent tax evasion by persons in the higher income groups. If this assurance were forthcoming, he would move thenecessary amendments at the Report stage.The War Cabinet-. Approved the line which the Chancellor of the exchequer proposed to take in dealing with this matter.Reconstruction 5.   The Prime Minister said that, in accordance with the plans. conclusion reached by the War Cabinet at their Meeting on the(Previous 21st October, he had circulated a Directive (W.P. (43) 476) settingReference: out tne procedure to be followed for ensuring the completion of w.M. (43) 144th plans for the transition period.Conclusions,Minute l.)

(43) 476.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,27 A October, 1943.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, to arrange for the necessary consultations to take place with the United States Govern-ment, the Dutch Government, the Dominions governments and the Government of India in regard to the suggestionthat a campaign of publicity should be started with a viewto forcing the Japanese to remedy the treatment accordedby them to our prisoners of war.A further report should be made to the War Cabinet whejithe views of these Governments had been ascertained.
