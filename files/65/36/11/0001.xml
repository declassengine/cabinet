Post-War Relief. 1. The War Cabinet considered a Joint Memorandum by the(Previous Minister of Production, the President of the Board of Trade and reference: the Minister of State (W.P. (43) 481) regarding the instructions toW.M. (43) 2nd be given to our representatives at the forthcoming meeting of theConclusions.) Council of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Adminis-tration (UNRRA).Annexed to the Memorandum was a Note by the Minister ofState of conversations which he had held during his recent visit to washington with a view to reaching agreement with the UnitedStates authorities regarding the scope and functions of the relieforganisation; and a memorandum on this question which, as a resultof those discussions, he had communicated to the United states authorities before leaving Washington. It was recommended thatthese Memoranda should form the basis of the instructions to our representatives at the first session of the UNRRA Council.The Minister of Production said, that, as originally conceived,the relief organisation would have cut across the machinery of the combined Boards and would have made it impossible to maintainorderly control over the allocation of supplies required for the con-tinued prosecution of the war. Ministers in this country had found it necessary to oppose these inflated ideas of the functions of a relieforganisation; and, as was shown by the Memorandum, the UnitedStates authorities now seemed to have come round, very largely to ourview. If the proposals outlined in the Memorandum were&quot; accepted,the position of the Combined Boards would be fully safeguarded..The&apos;Minister of State said that, while it would be fatal to allowUNRRA to develop into a great international organisation,attempting to control the economic life of Europe or the world, atthe same time it was important that it should be enabled to work effectively within a limited and well-defined field. The under-standing which he had reached with the United States authorities would, he thought, form the basis of a workable scheme. But, while he was reasonably satisfied, with the results of his preliminaryconversations in Washington, it was to be expected that the repre-sentatives of some of the other Allied Governments would press fora wider interpretation of the functions of a relief organisation.This first session of the UNRRA Council was likely to be a critical&apos; meeting from this point of view.-The War Cabinet took the view that in these circumstances our representatives must have clear and definite instructions to makea determined effort to convince the representatives of the other AlliedX&quot; I Governments that the procedure outlined represented the mostpracticable approach to the relief problem; and to avoid showingsympathy with any efforts which might be made to expand the scopeof UNRRA beyond the limits indicated, in the Memorandum.Other points made in the course of the discussion were  (a) The President of the Board of Trade said that the ministers concerned were satisfied that the time had now come totransfer the responsibility for relief questions from theBoard of Trade to the Foreign Office.It was agreed that this transfer of responsibility should now be made. It was understood, that the responsibilityfor ensuring the supplies required to meet relief needswould continue to rest with the Minister of Productionand the Minister of Food.   *(b) It was proposed in the Memorandum that the minister resident in Washington for Supply should lead the.United Kingdom Delegation at the first meeting of theUNRRA Council; and that Sir Frederick Leith-Rossshould act as his deputy.  This was agreed, to.(c) The Prime Minister referred to the War. cabinets discussion on the 5th January, 1943, about building upstocks of foodstuffs for the relief of liberated territories.Consideration had been given at that time to the possi-bility of a joint declaration by the United  StatesFood stocks for Relief.
Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government. He (thePrime Minister) had undertaken to inform the president that, if such a declaration were made, we should, be willing to say that in dealing with liberated territoriesGreat Britain would not fall behind any other country inphilanthropy and readiness to make sacrifices after thewar. The President had, however, said that he did not favour a joint declaration at that time (W.P. (43) 43rdConclusions).Continuing, the Prime Minister said that he had been somewhat disturbed, to find that provisional estimates of food requirements for liberated territories had been communicated by British Government Departments to&apos;&quot;Washington and were under discussion there. He was afraid lest an argument might be founded on these estimates, which had not been approved by the WarCabinet, to the effect that the present scale of food sup-plies of the people of this country would be reducedafter the war in order to feed, liberated countries. ThePrime Minister said that he had sent a minute on thismatter to the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Food.The War Cabinet was informed that the position in this matter had now been fully safeguarded and that the War Cabinet&apos;approval would be sought before any action was taken to commitHis Majesty&apos;s Government to the estimates in question. Moreover,there could be no question of the people of this country being reducedto the low food standards which would necessarily obtain in the period immediately after hostilities in the liberated areas. Indeed, everyeffort would be made not merely to maintain the present standardbut to introduce greater variety.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed that W.P. (43) 461 and the Memorandum reproduced in Annex II thereof should be taken as the instructionsto our representatives at the first meeting of the UNRRACouncil, whose attention should be called to the pointreferred to at &quot; X.&quot;(2) Approved the proposals put forward in paragraphs 9 and11 of W.P. (43) 461 regarding the composition of theUnited Kingdom Delegation at this meeting.House ofCommons.Plans for rebuilding.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 5thConclusions,-Minute 2 (,v).)2. The Prime Minister suggested that the time had now come when a resolution should be moved in the House of Commons toappoint a Select Committee to consider and report on plans for rebuilding of the House of Commons. The Prime Minister said thathe attached importance to the rebuilding being upon the plan of theold Chamber, subject to only minor alterations in detail.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the following Resolution should be put on theorder paper, and moved before the end of the present session : &apos;&apos; That a Select Committee be appointed toconsider and report upon plans for the rebuilding ofthe House of Commons and upon such minor altera-tions as may be considered desirable while preservingall its essential features.&quot;Some discussion ensued as to the composition of a SelectCommittee and it was agreed that, in choosing members, particular-regard should be paid to length of service in the House.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
