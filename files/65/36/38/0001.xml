Matters arising 1. The War Cabinet had a discussion on certain mattersout of the arising out of the Conferences at Cairo and Teheran. This isConferences at recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War CabinetCairo and        Conclusions.Teheran. --Demobilisation. 2. The War Cabinet resumed their discussion of demobilisa-(Previous tion policy.reference: In addition to the Memoranda which they had considered atW.M. (43) 168th their meeting on the 9th December, they now had before them a conclusions.)    further Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService (W.P. (43) 564), and a Memorandum on Building labour by the Minister of Reconstruction (W.P. (43) 565).The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he had given further consideration to the suggestion, put forward at theprevious discussion, that the term &apos;&apos; demobilisation &apos;&apos; should not beused in connection with the re-distribution of man-power after theend of war with Germany. The adoption of this suggestion wouldinvolve some recasting of the scheme outlined in the Report of the demobilisation Committee (W.P. (43) 494), and he had set out in w.P. (43) 564 some of the main consequences of this new conception.It would be necessary to stress the fact that the German and japanese wars were essentially a single war, and that demobilisation of the Armed Forces could not take place until this war as a wholehad been terminated. After the end of war with Germany, therewould be a reallocation of man-power, and men no longer needed for the Armed Forces would be placed on the reserve and reallocatedto meet the requirements of civil industries. During this periodyoung men now deferred and those reaching the age of 18 would continue to be called up. The basis of release from the Forces wouldbe age and length of service : the question of giving preference formarriage or overseas service could stand over until final demobilisa-tion. In addition, there would be a limited release of individualspecialists, which would be kept broadly within the figure of 2 percent, suggested in the Report of the Demobilisation Committee.There would be no block releases of police, teachers or any other special classes, except under the arrangements for individual releasesof specialists.The essence of this scheme was that power to direct labour would have to be retained after the end of war with Germany ifwe were to be able to restart essential civilian industry on an orderlybasis. During this period there would still be a serious shortageof man-power; and it would be impossible to secure a properdistribution of the available supply of labour without power to allocate and to direct,A further reason for deferring the introduction of a demobilisa-tion scheme was the differing needs of the three Services for thepurposes of war against Japan. The Army would be able to releasesubstantial numbers of men; but releases from the R.A.F. wouldbe much smaller, and the Navy would be able to release only acomparatively small number. In these circumstances it would bevery difficult/if a scheme of demobilisation were adopted, to produce any sense of fairness as between the members of the three Services.The main points raised in discussion were as follows : (a) No &quot; Demobilisation &quot; until Germany and Japan bothdefeated.There was strong support for the underlying conception of: the Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service,namely, that the war against Germany and Japan must beregarded as a single war and that demobilisation would not takeplace until Japan had been defeated. This would be of great value in bringing home to public opinion in this country the importanceof maintaining our efforts to the full until Japan had been defeated.The removal of the air threat from Germany, and the end ofblackout would have a very great effect on public opinion, and weshould have to do all in our power to maintain public enthusiasm
for the war against Japan. It was also important to bear in mind the effect on the United States of any course of action which might seem to imply a slackening of effort once Germany had been defeated.On the other hand, it was urged that we must at all costs avoidbasing our plans on a conception which asked more of the general public than they would be likely to accept when the time came.(b) Continuance of Labour Controls after Defeat of Germany.Discussion followed as to the extent to which it would benecessary to continue labour controls after Germany had been defeated.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that a considerable proportion of the labour in the aircraft industry consisted of married women, many of whom would &quot;give up employment as soonas Germany had been defeated. The view of his Ministry was that,unless labour controls were maintained, within a year of the defeat of Germany the labour force employed in the aircraft industry would have sunk below the figure necessary to maintain production at the level required for the war against Japan.Generally, The Minister of Labour and National Service saidthat he had every reason to suppose that there would be ashortage of labour in the year after Germany had been defeated, onthe basis of the present estimates of the production requirements ofthe Services and the numbers to be released from the Forces.The President of the Board of Trade also said that thecontinuance of powers of direction after the defeat of germany would be of the greatest value in ensuring a due supply of labour for those industries which were of importance from the point ofview of restarting our export trade.(c) Should Power be retained to direct Men and Women released from the Armed Forces?While it was recognised that, to maintain the necessary levelof war production and at the same time to expand or restartcertain essential civilian industries, it would be necessary that thepower to allocate and direct labour should be maintained after theend of war with Germany, considerable doubt was expressed aboutthe expediency of seeking to subject to direction men and women whohad been released from the Armed Forces. Persons who had been released from the Forces on a basis of age plus length of service, andnot for the special purpose of returning to a particular industry,would naturally feel that they should be at liberty to return to their pre-war occupation or to some other occupation of their ownchoosing. A man who had kept a shop before the war would not take kindly to being directed, on his release from the Army, to employment in the textile industry. Further, if he were so directed,there would be a subsequent problem of resettlement in his normaloccupation&apos; at the end of war with Japan. Some Ministers feltthat there would be a risk of serious discontent if men who thought they had earned a free discharge from the Forces (subject only tothe liability to recall to the colours) found themselves subject to industrial direction. It was to be remembered that the whole systemof labour direction rested on the willing co-operation of the majorityof the persons affected; the system would break down if anysubstantial number of persons disregarded the directions given.The suggestion was made that this difficulty might be met byleaving such persons free, in the first instance, to find employment for themselves, but indicating that, if within a specified periodthey had not found work in their old occupation or in some freshoccupation, the Government would be ready to find them employment.(d) A t what point would Paid Furlough, Service Gratuities and .Reinstatement Rights become available?The question was raised whether paid furlough, servicegratuities and reinstatement rights would be immediately availableto persons released after the end of war with Germany, or whether these would be withheld until the stage of demobilisation wasreached at the end of war with Japan.
The Minister of Labour and National Service said that this wasa point which he would wish to discuss further with the service ministers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the logicalbasis of the benefit proposed for men on release from the army viz., substantial demobilisation furlough in addition to servicegratuities to enable them to find their feet again in industry would be largely destroyed if they were still to be under the obliga-tion to take employment under State direction. The case for suchbenefit would emerge later when they were finally released from government control, but, on the other hand, there would then be the obvious difficulty of discriminating between men who had been released from the Services and those who had been continuously indirected employment. If a man released from the Armed forces were directed, say, to the textile industry and worked there side by side with a man similarly directed who had previously been engagedin war production, it would be difficult after some substantial time had elapsed to make a financial grant to one and not to the other.He thought it important, however, that these grants should be madeavailable at the time when they would be most valuable in helpingmen to re-establish themselves in civil life.(e) Reference was then made to the building programme. TheMinister of Reconstruction referred to the examination he had madewith the other Ministers concerned of the extent to which it wouldbe possible to increase the resources available for house buildingimmediately after the end of war with Germany by expedients not involving block releases of skilled building operatives from theServices. This showed that it would be possible to achieve a rateof expansion in the building labour force more satisfactory thanthat which had been contemplated under the demobilisation planoutlined in W.P. (43) 494.The Minister of Health said that already there was serious concern as to the small amount of labour available for housebuilding. Unless there was the strictest control of repair andmaintenance, it would be very difficult to concentrate an adequatevolume of labour on house building after the end of the war inEurope. Public opinion would insist on a considerable amount of house building being done in the first year after Germany had been defeated. He asked whether it would not be worth whileapproaching the problem the other way round; namely, settlingwhat volume of house building must be achieved in the first year after Germany had been defeated, and then considering what measures would be necessary to secure the required volume of labour.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the wholequestion of demobilisation at the end of hostilities in Europe-required further examination on the basis of the latest suggestionsput forward by the Minister of Labour and National Service in w.P. (43) 564.&quot; In considering this matter, it would be necessary totake into account the various points raised in discussion, and alsothe public statements which had been made to the effect that therewould be a measure of demobilisation when Germany had been defeated.The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toarrange for further discussions to take place on the main points arising out of his further Memorandum (a) with representatives of the Service Departments; and(&amp;) with representatives of the Ministry of Production,the Supply Departments and the Board of Trade.(2) Agreed that discussion should be resumed as soon as this further examination had taken place.of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,15th December, 1943.
