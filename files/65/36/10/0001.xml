Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M.(43) 138thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Mediterranean.South-west pacific.naval operations.Shipping Losses.Home Waters.Mediterranean.MilitaryOperations.Italy.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Owing to the moon and bad weather conditions bomber command had had a light week. Coastal Command had made13 attacks on U-boats. The assessment of these attacks (not yetcomplete) gave 3 U-boats sunk and 5 probably damaged. enemy losses had been 12 aircraft destroyed. Our losses had been 1 fighter and 4 Coastal Command aircraft.United States aircraft had made a most successful attack onthe Schweinfurt factories, which composed two-thirds of Germany&apos;shall-bearing production. All the factories had been heavily hit.The attack had entailed heavy fighting. The United States AirForce claimed 104 enemy aircraft destroyed. Fifty-nine Fortresseshad been lost and 2 fighters.Allied Air Forces had attacked communications in Italy and airfields in Greece and the ^aegean. Enemy losses in this theatrehad been 91 aircraft destroyed (52 on the ground), 7 probably destroyed and 35 damaged.   Allied losses amounted to 15 aircraft.Two-fifths of our bomber effort in the Mediterranean had been directed against targets in Greece and the iEgean.The Chief of the Air Staff was requested to inform air marshal Tedder that the War Cabinet considered it very satis-factory that it had been possible to direct so high a proportionof our air effort against these targets and hoped that it couldbe maintained.On the 13th October Allied aircraft had bombed the airfields and shipping at Rabaul. Six large and 43 small merchant ships,together with some 70 small craft, were claimed to have been sunk or damaged. Kahili airfield had also been attacked. 210 Japanese aircraft had been claimed as destroyed in this area as against an allied loss of 13.Shipping losses by enemy action during the previous week amounted to 10,000 tons.The number of U-boats in the Atlantic was now greater thanit had been for a considerable period.Supplies had been landed at Leros and a number of woundedevacuated from the Island.During the previous week Allied troops had made the biggestadvance in the centre of the line. The heaviest fighting, however,had taken place on the western flank, where the Volturno had been successfully crossed. It was thought that the Germans intended to delay as long as possible our advance on Rome.Russian progress during the previous &apos;week had not been very big territorially, but had been made in face of very strong opposi-tion. The Russians had succeeded not only in holding all theirbridgeheads across the Dnieper, but in enlarging them and makingothers. It was thought that some of the German troops from the crimea had been transferred to the line from Zaporozhe toMelitopol.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.PortugueseAtlanticIslands.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 138thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Prime Minister said that the announcement of theAgreement reached With the Portuguese Government about the azores had passed off very satisfactorily. There had been nounfavourable reactions in Spain. He saw no reason why the UnitedStates Government (who had left the negotiation of this agreement to us on account of our long-standing Treaty with Portugal) shouldnot now open direct negotiations with the Portuguese Governmentwith a view to the facilities in the Azores being made available tothe United States forces also.
Anglo-Soviet-AmericanConference.(previous reference erence:W.M. (43) 137thConclusions,Minute 4.)Prisoners  ofTflfar.Exchange of sick and woundedprisoners.(PreviousHef erence:W.M. (43) 129thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Prime Minister gave the &quot;War Cabinet information inregard to certain matters likely to be raised at the Conference at moscow, which would open almost immediately. Particulars are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of &quot;War cabinet conclusions.4. The Minister of State informed the War Cabinet that negotiations had been successfully concluded for the reciprocalexchange, under the provisions of the Geneva Convention, of BritishEmpire and United States disabled prisoners of war from Germany.The Agreement provided for the repatriation from both sides of allseriously sick and wounded prisoners of war who had been recom-mended by medical authorities.The exchange was being carried out in three separate move-ments : First, German prisoners of war from camps in the UnitedKingdom and North America, and British prisoners (nearly allbelonging to this country) would be exchanged at Gothenburg.Secondly, German prisoners from a North-West African port wouldbe sent to a port in France. Thirdly, other German prisoners fromthe Middle East, and prisoners from the forces of Australia, NewZealand, South Africa, India and other parts of the BritishCommonwealth, would be exchanged at Barcelona.It was intended that an announcement on this matter shouldbe made in Parliament on the following day. The Germans might,however, announce the matter at an earlier hour, in which case itmight be necessary to release a notice for issue in the Press on thefollowing morning.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement and decided that, in any event,an announcement on the matter should be made by theMinister of State in Parliament on the following day.Air Raids.^Casualties and damage.(PreviousPeference: .W.M. (43) 115thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The War Cabinet were informed that, of eighteen enemy aircraft which had crossed the coast during the previous night, tenhad penetrated to the Greater London area. There had been considerable damage to property in St. Pancras and Walthamstow,and bombs had also been dropped in other London boroughs.Casualties during the night&apos;s raids, including scattered attacks.inthe Home Counties, had been eleven killed and thirty-four seriously injured.The War Cabinet Took note of this statement.Disposal of 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSurplus Goods   Minister without Portfolio (W.P. (43) 437) covering a Report byand Factories.    an Interdepartmental Committee on the post-war disposal ofGovernment surplus stocks of raw materials, consumer goods,machinery and machine tools, and factories and storage premises nolonger required for Government purposes.Points in discussion were : 1(a) The Secretary of State for War said that, while his department had been consulted at various stages in the enquiry bythe Interdepartmental Committee, they had not had an opportunityto comment on the terms of the Report. They had various points of detail which they wished to raise; and he undertook to communi-cate these to the Minister without Portfolio.
The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of Statefor Air supported the proposals made in the Report.(b) The Minister of Labour and National Service asked that, inthe further enquiries about factory premises which were contem-plated in Part II of the Report, special attention should be givento (i) the possibility of converting into trading estates some of the factories no longer required for Government purposes; and (ii) theimportance of ensuring that, in releasing factories which had beenrequisitioned for use as storage space, priority should so far aspracticable be given to factories urgently needed for purposes ofpeace-time production.The Minister without Portfolio undertook to see that attention was given to these points.(c) The Minister of Production and the President of the Boardof Trade emphasised the importance of ensuring that plans for thedisposal of surplus stocks of any particular commodities were not made without consultation with the industries concerned, in themanufacture and distribution of those commodities.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the principles .set out in the Report annexed toW.P. (43) 437.(2) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to make apublic statement regarding the principles to be applied in regard to the post-war disposal of surplus government stocks.7. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (43) 453) regarding the allocation ofthe labour available for the Government Building Programme in theperiod October to December 1943.The Minister of Production said that the demands on bothBritish and United States building labour were higher than hadbeen expected; and the supply of labour was insufficient to meet theminimum requirements of the programme. Since his memorandum was written, approval had been given for an urgent operationalproject involving an additional commitment of 15,000 building labour over the next three to four months. He therefore felt obligedto recommend that the 19,000 men engaged on the government building Programme who were due to be called up during thecurrent quarter should be allowed to remain in the industry untilthe end of the year.The Prime Minister stressed the importance of avoiding further delay in completing the constructional work required for the build-up of the United States air forces in this country. In orderto concentrate on the early completion of these airfields, it would bewell worth while for the United States to send over another 20,000constructional troops, even at the expense of delaying to that extent the build-up of operational units of the United- States Army in thiscountry.In this connection the Secretary of State for Air said that wehad fallen behind schedule in the preparation of certain airfields in East Anglia which were of vital importance for the operations of the United States Army Air Force. He recognised that this wasa specially difficult area for the supply of building&apos;labour; but everyeffort should be made to avoid further delays in the construction ofthese particular airfields.The Minister of L,abour and National Service said that the allocations of man-power up to the end of 1943 had been determinedby the War Cabinet on a review of the position as a whole; and, if those decisions were modified to meet special difficulties in one section of the war effort, it would be impossible for him to maintain
the balance of the programme as a whole. He had just completeda survey of the man-power position in 1944; and he asked that, untilMinisters had seen this survey, no final decision should be taken to postpone the call-up of this 19,000 men from the building industry.The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to impress on president roosevelt the advantages of sending from the UnitedStates a further 20,000 constructional troops to ensurethe rapid completion of the airfields and other construc-tion urgently required to meet the operational needs ofUnited States forces in this country. The Minister ofProduction undertook to provide the Prime minister with statistical material to be used in support of thissuggestion.(2) Agreed that further consideration of the proposal to defer the call-up of the 19,000 men from the building industry should be postponed until Ministers had seen the man-power survey for 1944 which the Minister of Labour and national Service was about to circulate.(3) Asked that meanwhile the Minister of Labour and national Service should arrange that no large numbersof men were called up from the building industry,especially from among those engaged in airfield construc-tion in East Anglia.United States. 8.   The War Cabinet had a short discussion as to the lineEeport by Five which the Prime Minister should take in answering a Parliamen-United States    tary Question by Mr. Peter Macdonald, M.P., on the following day-.Senators. about the report made by the five United States Senators.The general view of the War Cabinet was that it would give this matter undue importance if the Prime Minister were to dealwith it in detail, and that the balance of advantage lay in hismaking a very short reply, to the effect that he did not wish tocontrovert in detail the various statements, included in the report at a time when British and American forces were fighting side by&apos;&apos;side.At the same time, the War Cabinet recognised that, if state-ments such as those contained in the report by the five United StatesSenators continued to be given currency, it might, at a later date,be necessary for an authoritative reply to be made.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 118th October, 1943.
