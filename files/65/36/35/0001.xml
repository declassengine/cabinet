Ethiopia. 1.   At their Meeting on the 8th November, the War Cabinet(Previous had appointed a Committee to review our existing policy in respectEeferenee: of Ethiopia, and to make early recommendations as to the lines on W.M. (43) 15lst which a further enquiry might be made into the means of improvingConclusions, conditions in Ethiopia, the persons by whom such an enquiry should minute 5.) &apos;     De made, and the instructions by which they should be guided.The War Cabinet now had before them a Report from thisCommittee (W.P. (43) 557) recommending that a Mission of enquiry should visit Ethiopia.   To this report were attached as Annexes (1) The proposed terms of reference of the Mission of Enquiry.(2) A memorandum on the Policy of His Majesty&apos;s government towards Ethiopia, to be given to the Mission for their general guidance.(3) A   draft   telegram   to   His   Majesty&apos;s   Minister   atAddis Ababa.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the LordChancellor had mentioned to him the importance of ensuring thatthe position in regard to slavery was included within the scope ofthe Mission&apos;s enquiry.The War Cabinet were informed that the status of slavery hadbeen abolished in Ethiopia. The matter was therefore covered byItem (6) of the Terms of Reference &quot; The Administration ofJustice,&quot; and it was regarded as inappropriate to refer to thematter specifically in the terms of reference. The Chairman of theMission should, however, be asked to make sure that the position asto slavery was effectively covered by the Mission.(b) The Deputy Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinetthat, at an earlier stage, when it had been proposed to deal:r .. with   this   question   by   means   of   a   Conference   at   Cairo,&apos;) , &apos; Field-Marshal Smuts had asked that his representative should beinvited to attend the Conference. Field-Marshal Smuts might wisha South African representative to be associated with the Mission.He accordingly suggested that the Dominions Office should beauthorised to telegraph to the Dominion Prime Ministers and inform them of the course of action now proposed.This was. agreed to.(c) The question was raised whether any clearer indicationcould be given of what was meant by the phrase in paragraph 7 of annex II, &quot; some modest increase in the degree of financial helpprovided under the existing Agreement.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would rather not give a specific figure at this stage; but he undertook to give theChairman of the Mission some general indication of the order ofthe figure which he had in mind.(d) It was agreed that the last sentence of Annex III should read &quot; It would probably spend some three or four weeks in thecountry.&quot;(e) Chairman of the Mission.Several names were suggested, and it was agreed that sir Francis Humphrys should be asked to undertake theChairmanship.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) The course proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer inhis Memorandum, the proposed terms of reference of theMission of Enquiry, and the Memorandum on Policy(Annexes I and II) were approved.
(2) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was invited totake the necessary steps to arrange for the appointmentof the Mission of Enquiry, in consultation with Depart-ments concerned, and to make a communication to our minister at Addis Ababa in the terms of Annex III, asamended in discussion.(3) The Dominions Office were authorised, at the appropriatestage, to send a communication to the Dominion PrimeMinisters informing them of the course proposed.Post-War civil air Transport.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 146thConclusions,Minute 3.)2.   The War Cabinet had before them (a) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Aircraft Production on the Design and construction of Post-War Civil Aircraft (W.P. (43) 532).(b) A Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal on the same subject (W.P. (43) 537).The former Memorandum reported the progress made in regardto the design of a large multi-engined land plane conforming tothe requirements laid down by the Brabazon Committee.In the Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal, which had beenapproved by the Committee on Civil Air Transport, it was represented that, as this machine would not come into use for about six years, and as the York did not meet our needs, work on the design and construction of the Tudor (a civil version of the Lancaster IVbomber) should be undertaken forthwith.The Lord Privy Seal said that it had now been agreed with ministers concerned that action should proceed with the design ofthe Tudor, with prototypes of the Tudor, and with full-scalepreparations for production of the Tudor. The Chancellor of theExchequer would, however, be consulted (as regards the numbers of aircraft to be ordered, &amp;c.) before production orders were placed for the Tudor.The War Cabinet were reminded that, as regards the largemulti-engined land plane, authority had already been given for the design and for the construction of two prototypes. The Ministerof A aircraft Production said that a further reference would be madeto the War Cabinet before orders were placed for the constructionof aircraft of this type beyond the two prototypes.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the position in regard to the large multi-. engined land plane, as set out in W.P. (43) 532 and explained in discussion,(2) Agreed that action should proceed for (a) the design, (b) theconstruction of prototypes, and (c) all preparations forthe production of the Tudor; it being understood that reference would be made to the Chancellor of theExchequer before production orders for these aircraft were placed.Offices of the War Cabinet.
