Reference was made to statements published in AmericaOperations that over 70 per cent, of the forces engaged in the invasion ofagainst Western Europe would be American. The question was raised whether someEurope. further statement ought not to be made, to put the matter in itsProportion of     proper perspective.British and The vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that heUnited States would like time to consider this question, but suggested that anyForces. publication of the percentages of British and United States forces to be engaged in this operation would convey information to theenemy. Any further statement ought, therefore, to be in very general terms.
The suggestion was also made that it might be desirable thatany further statement should be issued by the United states authorities and not from this country.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chiefs of Staff to report whether, from themilitary point of view, there was any objection to afurther statement being made as to the proportion ofBritish and United States forces to be engaged in theforthcoming operations against the Continent of Europe;and, if it were decided to make a further statement, what form it should take.Ban.Loss of ships in Harbour.(previous reference:W.M.(43)169thConclusions,Minute 1.)Foreign Affairs.Boumania,Yugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M.
