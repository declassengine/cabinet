(43) 106thConclusions,Minute 2; andW.M. (43) 111thConclusions,Minute 1.)[26318]2. The Prime Minister drew attention to the fact that oursterling indebtedness to India was growing at the rate of a million a day and was now over  800 millions. This was a very serious,position, and he thought that grave embarrassment would arise ifthe facts continued to be kept from the public knowledge.Moreover, it seemed clear that, for large operations in the Far East,we should have to rely to a considerable extent on base facilities inthe Middle East. He was also informed that, as a result of inflationin India, we were paying, an excessive price for commoditiespurchased there.The Paymaster-General gave various instances, based on figures given in a Memorandum circulated to the Standing Committee on indian Financial Questions. Among the instances quoted was thatwe were paying  25 millions this year for petrol purchased at theb 2
price of 3s. 2d. a gallon. The prices ,of atta and ghi were alsoquoted. These now stood at 19- 8s. and 210s. per 100 lbs. ascompared with the pre-war figures of 4-5s. and 79:5s.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Committee on indian Financial Questions had held several meetings and had thenadjourned pending the submission of detailed particulars whichhad been asked for from India. These particulars had only just been received and were to be considered at an early meeting of theCommittee.The Prime Minister said that he thought it would be thegeneral view of the War Cabinet that continuance of the increasein our sterling indebtedness to India at the present rate wouldresult in a very serious position at the end of the war, moreespecially if the debt&apos; was due in part to our being charged inflatedprices.The War Cabinet-(1) Asked that the Standing Committee on Indian financial questions should submit an early Report on the mattersremitted to it.(2) Asked the Secretary of State for India to submit a Reportto the Prime Minister on the statement that HisMajesty&apos;s Government was spending  25 millionsduring this financial year in purchasing petrol in india at the rate of 3s. 2d. a gallon.Moscow 3.   The Prime Minister said that the news received from theConference. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs showed that the Moscow(Previous Conference was proceeding very well on all points.   It looked as ifReference: we should receive satisfaction in regard to the treatment of BritishW.M.

He thought that this matter wouldrequire very, careful examination, and would possibly have to bebrought before the War Cabinet before a final conclusion wasreached.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Portuguese 4.   The Prime Minister said that the United States Adminis-Atiantic tration had modified the instructions which they had originallyIslands. given to Mr. Kennan, their Charge dAffaires at Lisbon, regarding(Previous the demands to be made on the Portuguese Government for the reference:        grant of facilities in the Azores.   They were now prepared to leaveW.M. (43) 142nd the conduct of these negotiations to their Charge d&apos;Affaires.   TheConclusions,      Prime Minister thought that we should leave it to His Majesty&apos;sMinute 2.)        Ambassador at Lisbon to advise Mr. Kennan in this matter.   his personal view was that he doubted whether the United StatesGovernment would be satisfied until they had obtained for UnitedStates Forces the same facilities as had been accorded to british forces and, in addition, facilities for a ferry service for UnitedStates aircraft. *-

At their meeting on the 16th August the War Cabinet had discussed the question whether Members of Parliament should beappointed to positions on the staff of AMGOT. While no con-clusion had been recorded, it bad been the general view of the WarCabinet on that occasion that it might be politically embarrassingif Members of Parliament were appointed to these posts. TheSecretary of State for War had been invited to consider the matter further in the light of the discussion.The Secretary of State for War said that it had now become necessary for him to make a public statement on this point, in answer to a Parliamentary Question on the following day. on further reflection, he was now disposed to think that it would bedifficult to maintain a ban on the appointment of Members ofParliament to these posts.The Prime Minister agreed with this view. He thought theposition should be that Membership of the House of commons should not disqualify for appointment. Any application from aMember of Parliament should be considered on its merits; whetherit succeeded would, of course, depend on the qualifications of theother candidates offering themselves for appointment.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for War to answer theParliamentary Question on the lines proposed by thePrime Minister.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,2Uh October, 1943.
