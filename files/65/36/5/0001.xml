(43) 129thConclusions,Minute 6.)german atrocities.1. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that, asa result of a recent exchange of telegrams, it had now been agreedthat the King of Italy should declare war on Germany as soon aspossible, and that a Declaration should be made by the three major powers defining the Italian position and explaining theco-belligerent status of Italy. .   , iThe War&apos; Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this action.2. The Prime Minister referred to the atrocities which theGermans were now committing in the various countries which theywere holding in subjection, or from which they were now being-driven. An eye-witness had reported that in the Island of Kos100 Italian officers had been shot by the Germans in cold blood.Other instances of German &apos;&apos; frightfulness &apos;&apos; were continually being received. He (the Prime Minister) thought that it would have a salutary effect if a declaration were now made by ourselves, theUnited States and Russia to the effect that a number of german officers or members of the Nazi Party, equal to those put to deathby the Germans in the various countries, would be returned to thesecountries after the war for judgment. The Prime Minister addedthat, if his colleagues approved, he would draft such a declaration and submit it to President Roosevelt and Marshal Stalin.The War Cabinet Approved the Prime Ministers suggestion.India.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 136thConclusions.)3. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the Revisewhich he had prepared of Annexure &quot; B &quot; to W.P. (43) 435.The War Cabinet-Expressed general agreement with the terms of thisrevised draft* subject to the opening words of paragraph 2reading as follows :  &apos;&apos; The Material and cultural con-ditionsAnglo-Soviet-AmericanConference.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 135thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The War Cabinet had a discussion on the following papersdealing with matters likely to be raised at the forthcoming conference of Foreign Secretaries : (1) Memorandum by the Prime Minister (WP. (43) 447)containing Notes for the Foreign Secretary&apos;s use at theforthcoming Meeting.(2) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(W.P. (43) 444) on the Scope and Functions of thePolitico-Military Commission.(3) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(W.P. (43) 438) on the Western Frontiers of Russia.(4) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(W.P. (43) 439) on Resistance in Poland.The record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.* Circulated as W.P. (43) 450.[26230-3]b 2
Civil Aviation. 5.   The War Cabinet .had before them a, Memorandum by(Previous Lord Cranborne (W.P. (43) 406) outlining the progress made in the reference: arrangements for the proposed discussions on. civil aviation. this.M. (43) 117th described the plans made for a preliminary meeting of Common-Conclusions, wealth representatives in London; and invited the War Cabinet to minute 3.)        ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to take steps toensure the summoning of an International Conference at the earliestpossible moment.The Lord Privy Seal explained that the preliminary meetingof Commonwealth representatives was to open in London on thefollowing Monday, the 11th October, and the Canadian Minister ofMunitions and Supply, Mr. Howe, had now agreed to come over forthis meeting. This had made it possible to modify to some extent the proposals described in Lord Cranborne&apos;s Memorandum; and itwas now contemplated that, after the London meeting, Mr. Howeand representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom should proceed to Washington for informal discussions with representatives of the United States Government. It wouldbe a great advantage if such informal Anglo-Canadian-Americanconversations could take place before a more formal international conference was summoned. This would be put at the Londonmeeting to the representatives of the other Dominions, who wouldbe asked whether they were agreeable that the Lord Privy Seal andMr. Howe should look after their interests in these Washingtonconversations.In view of this change of plan, it was no longer necessary toask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to take any steps atthis stage towards convening an International Conference, andthere would be no need for him to refer to this question in theforthcoming discussions in Moscow.The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Lord Privy Seaksproposal to arrange for conversations on civil aviation tobe held in Washington between representatives of theUnited Kingdom, United States and Canadian Govern-ments before any further step was taken to convene anInternational Conference on this subject.Coal.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 70thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (W.P. (43) 446) recommending certainimmediate changes in the existing system for securing operational control over the coal-mining industry, and suggesting that the WarCabinet should appoint a Committee of Ministers to consider thepost-war organisation of the industry.The Memorandum contemplated that it should be announced inthe forthcoming Debate in the House of Commons that the Govern-ment were giving immediate attention to the short-term problem of improving the existing system of operational control.One of the most urgent needs was to increase the labour forceof the industry; and the War Cabinet were informed that theMinister of Labour and National Service and the Secretary of Statefor War had been considering whether it would be practicable toarrange for further releases of ex-miners from the Army. A schemewas being prepared by which some of the older miners now in theArmy would be released for employment in the mines, a corres-ponding number of young men being supplied to the Army in their place. No man would be released under this scheme from unitsoverseas or from units in this country earmarked for forthcoming-operations. It was, however, possible that some 2,000 or 3,000 men might be combed out of A.D.G.B. and similar formations. Thisscheme was approved in principle by the War Cabinet.
77W.M. 137 (43).The War Cabinet-Appointed a Committee consisting of The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),The Minister of Labour,The Minister of War Transport,The Minister of Fuel and Power, andThe Paymaster-General,to consider the question of improvements to the war-timemachinery for the operational control of the Coal-MiningIndustry.The Committee were asked, in the first instance, toreport to the War Cabinet on Monday, the 11th October,what should be said on this matter in the forthcoming-Debate.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,8th October, 1943.
