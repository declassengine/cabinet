It wasnot clear that any of the instruments so far signed gave the united nations the right to dispose of these ships, and it was important that this point should be fully safeguarded.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,after consultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty,&apos; to arrange for a paragraph to be inserted in theCunningham-Courtin agreement to the effect that theUnited Nations have the right to dispose as they, thought fit of the ships of the Italian Fleet; but if the memorandumcould not be satisfactorily amended, then to arrange forthis point to be covered in the long armistice terms.Italian Prisonersof War.(previous reference:W.M.

An indication of the development of opinion would be of the greatest assistance to the Dominion Governments.The Prime Minister agreed with this view, and said that theDominion Governments would be kept informed of the course ofthe discussions at the Conference.Armistice Day.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 140thConclusions,Minute 5.)7.
