Maggiore.   In this sector enemy counter-attacks had beenbeaten off with heavy losses.iEgean. On the morning of the 12th November the enemy had made twolandings on the Island of Leros, to the north and to the south ofAlinda Bay.   Later in the day parachute troops had been dropped[26445-2] b 21. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Owing to bad weather, air operations against Germany hadbeen confined to harassing attacks by Mosquitoes on. 11 Germancities.Heavy bombers had made two attacks on focal points of therailway system in Southern France, Modane and Cannes. In the raid on Modane, 1^ million engine miles had been flown without lossof a single aircraft. An attack had also been made on the railwayviaduct at Antheor. Photographic reports on these raids were notyet available, but it was believed that those on Modane and Canneshad been successful.Coastal Command had made 6 attacks on U-boats, 2 of whichhad been sunk and 3 possibly damaged.Fighter - Command had flown 3,120 sorties, mainly against targets in Northern France and in support of bombers of the UnitedStates air forces.Enemy losses had been 8 destroyed, 1 probably destroyed and1 damaged. Our losses had been 9 bombers, 20 fighters and 6 coastal command aircraft. Of 10 enemy aircraft which had raided thiscountry at night, 3 had been destroyed.United States Air Forces had made daylight attacks onMunster and Bremen. Owing to bad weather, only &quot;a proportion ofthe forces despatched had attacked their targets, and these had madeblind-bombing attacks. Nineteen bombers had been lost; but it wasclaimed that 43 enemy aircraft had been destroyed, 20 probably destroyed and 9 damaged.Weather had limited our air activity in the Mediterranean.Long-range fighter sweeps had been made over Leros; and bombing-attacks had been made on shipping in the ^aegean and on enemyairfields in Cos and Rhodes. Enemy losses in this theatre had been39 aircraft destroyed, compared with 36 Allied aircraft destroyed.Enemy air activity had increased; there had been two attacks onNaples and one on a convoy off North Africa.In South-East Asia air activity on both sides had increased.Spitfires had been in action for the first time in this theatre.The number of Allied sorties during the week had been 1,500,compared with 1,300 by the enemy. Allied losses were 40 aircraft,or 2 - 6 per cent, of the sorties flown. The enemy aircraft claimed tohave been destroyed, or probably destroyed, totalled 284, or&apos; 22 percent, of the enemy sorties flown.Heavy attacks had been made on Rabaul, and there had beena night attack on ships off New Ireland, in which it was claimed that 2 light cruisers, 3 destroyers and 2 motor vessels had been sunk and other vessels damaged. .Shipping losses by enemy action during the last week hadamounted to 33,000 tons. It &quot;was now known that 3 ships whichhad been reported in the previous week to have been damaged hadin fact been sunk, and this brought the figure for losses for that weekup to 37,000 tons. Although the rate of loss had been higher thismonth than in the recent past, only one of the ships so far lost hadbeen sunk by U-boat.A group of tank-landing craft returning to this country from gibraltar had been scattered by a storm. Three had been sunk and5 beached in the Scilly Islands.During the enemy attack on Leros 1 destroyer had been sunk and another damaged.In an air attack on a convoy off Oran 4 ships had been sunk and2 damaged.On the 8th Army front some advance had been made, mainly on the south-western sector of the front near Castel di Sangro.   The
on the Rachi Ridge. The primary aim of the attack had been to capture the isthmus in the middle of the island. This had beenfrustrated by operations carried out on the 14th November, as aresult of which the Rachi Ridge was cleared and the enemy troops were confined to three points on the coast the headland to the north of Alinda Bay, Santa Quaranta and Appetici. The position duringthe next few days was likely to be critical.The outstanding success of the past week had been the rapidadvance bejrond Kiev, which had led to the capture of Zhitomir.The Russians had thus cut an important railway running north andsouth, the loss of which would seriously hamper the movement ofGerman troops and supplies on this sector of the front. There hadbeen very heavy fighting in the Crimea, but it seemed that up to thepresent the Russian landings were being held in check.The War Cabinet Took, note of these statements.2. The War Cabinet again considered the position in the lebanon. Mr. Makins (see telegram No. 2325 from Algiers) had hadan interview on the 13th November with General de Gaulle, whoW.M. (43) 153rd had informed him that General Catroux was leaving for the LevantConclusions, with appropriate instructions and would call on the Minister of minute i.)        State Resident in the Middle East on his way to Beirut.The Permanent Undersecretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the War Cabinet that we had not received any furtherinformation as to the instructions given to General Catroux.The Minister of State Resident in the Middle East had flownfrom Cairo to Beirut, where he had had consultations with sir Edward Spears and the Army Commander. He had sincereturned to Cairo in order to see General Catroux on his way through. He had been due to have an interview with GeneralCatroux at 9 - 30 that morning, but no report of this interview had yet been received.The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the French were making, attempts to discount the gravity of the situation, but there was no doubt that there had been considerable disorder and loss of life.In his telegram from Beirut (No. 667) the Minister of StateResident in the Middle East had reported on the - 14th november that the French would certainly try to play for time, but, in hisopinion, the tension was increasing and we could not afford to let them do so. He recommended that, unless the French complied withour demands by Wednesday morning (the 17th November), we shouldtake certain measures of control in the principal towns. In effect,we should insist on the French authorities agreeing to our troopspatrolling the larger towns.A draft reply to this telegram had been prepared in the ForeignOffice, and copies were handed round.. Paragraph 1 of this draftsaid that there were some indications that the French were likelyto comply with our requests. The War Cabinet were informed thatthis was based on a statement made by General Catroux thatM. Helleu had acted without reference to Algiers. The draft telegram suggested that, if we had to take action, this could not be confined to patrolling the larger towns, as suggested by the Minister&apos; of State Resident in the Middle East. If the French rejected ouroutstanding demands we should have to proceed by way of publicdissociation from their recent actions, coupled with the impositionof British martial law as an arbitrary act. This course of action would, however, require Cabinet approval.In discussion, general agreement was expressed with the viewthat, if the French rejected our demands and we had to interveneby force, there was no alternative but to impose martial law on grounds of military security, and that in this event we should, ofThe Lebanon.(previous reference:
course, have to take steps to secure the release of the LebaneseMinisters who had been imprisoned by the French.Discussion turned mainly on the timing of the action to be taken and on the extent to which it would be desirable that the WarCabinet should indicate at this stage that they were prepared to contemplate, in certain circumstances, the imposition of Britishmartial law as an arbitrary act. On the former point, thePermanent Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthe tentative programme which the Foreign Office had in mind hadbeen to wait, say, another 24 hours and then, if no reply had beenreceived, to ask for compliance with our demands within, say, afurther 24 or 48 hours.On the, latter point, it was felt that the Minister of StateResident in the Middle East ought to be made aware of what theCabinet had in mind; but that authority to take a decision on this issue should, for the present at any rate, be retained by the WarCabinet.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) The draft telegram to the Minister of State Resident in theMiddle East, in reply to telegram No. 667 from Beirut,was approved subject to a minor amendment at thebeginning of paragraph 4.(2) Copies of this telegram should be sent to Algiers andBeirut; and a supplementary telegram should be sentto His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Beirut, to make it clear thatat the present stage, and without further reference tothe War Cabinet, no threat of the imposition of Britishmartial law should be made use of, or referred to, in thecourse of the negotiations.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.Reports in thePress.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 151stConclusions,Minute 2.)3. At their Meeting on the 8th November, 1943, the WarCabinet had invited the Home Secretary and Minister of home security and the Minicar of Information to consider whether therules regulating, the reporting of air-raid incidents could be somodified as to ensure (a) that  there  would  be  no  publication  of  casualties   inparticular raids except by special Cabinet direction; and(b) that the newspapers would be prevented from publishingdetailed accounts of particular incidents without specialauthority.The War Cabinet now had before them a Joint Memorandumby the two Ministers (W.P. (43) 516) explaining that, while thefirst of these points was covered by the existing rule, of which thePress might be reminded, there would be difficulties in meeting thesecond. It could not be enforced without a new Defence Regulation,which would be publicly resisted by the Press. And there were strong arguments against seeking, by giving guidance to Editors, to dissuade newspapers from publishing such accounts, e.g., thenecessity of keeping before the public the need for continuedreadiness to meet air attack, and the propaganda effect in America,of reports of air attacks on this country.- The Ministers concluded that the balance of advantage was against advising the Press toplace less emphasis on the effects of small-scale air raids.The Secretary of State for Air said that, while he did not dissent from the conclusion reached in the Memorandum, hethought it should be considered whether the existing instructionsrequired revision in regard to particular points which should not be mentioned in the Press accounts of air raids. The existing instruc-tions prohibited reference, for example, to land-mines; and hethought the time had come to consider whether this restrictionshould not be extended to other new weapons or methods of attack which might be adopted by the enemy. Unless this was done, therewas a risk of conveying useful information-to the enemy. He wouldbe glad if this matter could be considered by officials of the Air
Ministry, the Ministry of Home Security and the Ministry ofInformation.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security undertook to arrange for this point to be discussed by officials of the three departments.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed that, for the reasons outlined in W.P. (43) 516, nofurther action should be taken to prevent the newspapersfrom publishing, without special authority, detailedaccounts of particular air-raid incidents.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary and Minister of home security would arrange for officials of his Department,the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Information toconsider the point which the Secretary of State for Airhad raised in the course of the discussion.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,lUh November, 1943.
MOST SECRET NO circulation.M.C45) 154TH conclusions confidential Record(15th November, 1943 - 5.30 p.m. )The War Cabinet at the end of their meetingconsidered certain matters relating to the secrecy and security of those attending the forthcoming Conferencein Cairo.(a) It was observed that the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; that morning had. contained a telegram from Cairo quotingthe &quot;Bourse Egyptienne&quot; to the effect that the MenaHouse Hotel was being taken over in preparation forimportant conferences.      The question arose what line should be taken in Cairo in attempting to deceive theenemy.The view of the War Cabinet was that pre-pa rat ions could not be concealed, and therefore the bestline to take would be to put out conflicting rumours./The cover experts were so informed afterthe Meeting by Brigadier Jacob.J(b) The War Cabinet were informed that Britishnewspapers had been asked that day to refrain from printinganything about the preparations in Cairo and similarmatters, though it was not known what had been done inEgypt to guide the Press.     Was it wise to try and dampdown all mention of these topics?The view of the War Cabinet was that theinstructions issued, that day by the Minister of information to the Press should stand,(c) The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn tothe extremely distinctive position occupied by the Mena-House Hotel hard by the pyramids.      If the enemy gotaccurate inf orraa tion, he might well attempt to bomb the hotel.      The Chiefs of Staff had asked the Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East to pay particular attentionto the Air and Anti-aircraft defences, and the moon wouldnot be favourable to the enemy.      Nevertheless,  it mightbe wiser if  the Prime Minister did not sleep in theneighbourhood of the hotel, but in Cairo, which the enemyw uid be much less likely be bomb, and where his positionwould not be so accurately known.The War Cabinet invited the Deputy Prime Ministeito telegraph making this suggestion to the Prime Minister.(d) It was suggested that the movements of thePrime Minister&apos;s YORK,  particularly if she passed throughGibraltar, might be a guide to the enemy.      The Chiefof the Air Staff thought that as the YORK would would notbe carrying the Prime Minister from Gibraltar, hernaseage might even be a cause of confusion to the enemy.He doubted&quot;whether any special itinerary would be necessary.The War Cabinet endorsed this view.LINAGE OPI INFORMATIONffices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1
