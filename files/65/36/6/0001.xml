Berlin and other cities in germany had also been attacked by Mosquitoes. 4,700 tons of bombs had been dropped during the week. The attack on Frankfurt had been particularly successful and damage on the Hamburg scale was indicated at Hanover. Coastal Command had had a most successfulweek, making 14 attacks on U-boats. The Admiralty assessment of these attacks had been 5 sunk, 1 promising and 2 possibly damaged. During the week we had lost 47 bombers, 18 aircraft of fighter Command and the Tactical Air Force and 3 of coastal command. Enemy losses had been 29 aircraft destroyed, 4 probably destroyed and 13 damaged.United States aircraft had dropped 2,500 tons of bombs duringthe week.

In addition, on the previous day Fortresses had attacked Minister. The United States Air Forceclaimed 408 enemy aircraft destroyed, 117 probably destroyed and108 damaged.  American losses amounted to 105 aircraft.The War Cabinet Approved the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion that he should send a congratulatory message to Bomber Command and tothe 8th United States Air Force on the great achievementsof the past week.Allied Air Forces had attacked communications in northern italy and airfields in Greece. Enemy losses in this theatre had been76 aircraft destroyed, 13 probably destroyed and 63 damaged forthe loss of 43 Allied aircraft.Shipping losses by enemy action during the previous week,,including belated reports, amounted to 33,600 tons.Since the renewal of the submarine offensive in the middle oflast month 10 U-boats and a supply boat had been definitely sunk and 6 badly damaged. In an attack on a homeward-bound convoyon the 8th/9th October 1 Polish destroyer and 1 merchant ship hadbeen sunk.During a sweep in the ./aegean our naval forces had met anenemy convoy and had sunk 6 landing craft and an ammunition ship.A considerable number of enemy personnel had been drowned.During the previous week our main advance had been in thecentre and on the western flank. The Germans had reacted strongly against our successful landing at Termoli, but their counter-attacks had been held.The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet an account of theposition in the iEgean. He had asked the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to confer with General Sir Maitland Wilson,Admiral Sir John Cunningham and the First Sea Lord about theposition in this area.The Japanese had evacuated the. Islands of Vella Lavella andKolombangara. There were indications that they were withdrawingtowards Medang in New Guinea.The Russians had established bridgeheads across the Dnieperboth north and south of Kiev. A third bridgehead had been estab-lished, still further south, near Kremenjug. They had resumed the offensive in the Melitopol area.

Portuguese 2. The Prime Minister informed the. War Cabinet that it wasAtlantic intended to make a public announcement on the following day of the islands. Agreement which had been reached with the Portuguese Govern-previous ment whereby they made available to us certain facilities in the reference: Azores which would be of the greatest assistance in combatingW.M. (43) 84th enemy U-boats. The Foreign Office were much to be congratulatedConclusions, on the successful upshot of these negotiations.Minute 1.).  &apos; The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Italy. 3.   The Prime Minister said that the Declaration of War on(Previous Germany by the King of Italy and the Declaration by the threeReference: major Powers in regard to the Italian position would probably beWM (43U37th made on the following day.Conclusions,Minute 1.)Discussion followed as to the present composition of theBadoglio Government. The War Cabinet were informed that count Sforza, who was passing through this country, had made itclear that he supported the Badoglio Government, and had deniedthe rumours to the contrary which had been current in the UnitedStates. It was agreed that there was no reason &quot;why we should notfacilitate Count Sforza&apos;s journey to Algiers.It was suggested in discussion that General Roatta&apos;s continuedservice under the Badoglio Government might, in view of his previous record, give rise to some difficulties.The Prime Minister said our attitude was, of course, that we intended to press steadily for broadening the basis of the BadoglioGovernment.The Prime Minister asked the Minister of&apos; State to prepare aNote for him-(a) dealing with the position of General Roatta; and(b) setting out the advantages which the United Nations would gain from the co-belligerent status of Italy.AircraftCapacityfor Troops&apos;Mails.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 59thConclusions,.Minute 6.)4.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) A Joint Memorandum by the Chairman of the OverseasMails Committee and the Postmaster-General (W.P. (43)418) recommending on behalf of the Overseas MailsCommittee (the Air Ministry dissenting) that theaircraft capacity for troops&apos; mails to North Africa, theMiddle East and beyond should be increased from15,000 lbs. to 20,000 lbs. per week, in order to providefor the efficient functioning of the Airgraph and AirLetter services.(ii) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air(W.P. (43) 419) (a) objecting to an unlimited commit-ment to carry by air from the United Kingdom to north africa all light-weight letters offering to whatever figurethe traffic might rise; and (b) suggesting that the right course was to organise a regular and fast mail service to north Africa by ship, transport east of North Africabeing made by aircraft. .The discussion included the following points.: (a) The Postmaster-General said that Lord Wavell had authorised him to say that, in his opinion, an adequateair-mail service for the troops was, on military grounds,more important than the carriage by air of ammunitionor spare parts.The Prime Minister said that he endorsed this view.
83W.M. 138 (43).(b) The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that the weeklyallocation for carriage of troop mails by air had risen from 6,000 lbs. a year ago to the present figure of15,000 lbs.(c) The Secretary of State for Air said that there would be great difficulty in finding sufficient long-range aircraft and experienced crews for the j ourney from this countryto Gibraltar if the allocation were further increased.Under present conditions, the journey through the bay of Biscay was dangerous and aircraft had to make a longdetour.(d) The War Cabinet were informed by the First Lord of theAdmiralty that the suggestion of using some of theItalian men-of-war for this part of the journey had been examined, but was unlikely to be practicable, as these vessels had not the necessary endurance.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the existing allocation for the carriage oftroop mails by air should be raised forthwith from thepresent figure of 15,000 lbs. to 20,000 lbs. a week in eachdirection.(2) Invited the Chairman of the Overseas Mails Committee toarrange for an examination to be made as soon aspossible into the question whether, and to what extent,fast ships could be used in place of aircraft to carrytroop mails from this country to North Africa.Pending results of this examination, the WarCabinet deferred consideration of the proposal in theMemorandum by the Chairman of the Overseas MailsCommittee and the Postmaster-General that in futureair capacity should automatically be provided for air-graphs and light-weight air letters step by step with theincrease in the postings.5. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (43) 451) covering the draft ofa statement on the control of the coal-mining industry to be madeby the Minister of Fuel and Power in the Debate in the. House ofCommons which was to open on the following day.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that this draftresulted-from two meetings held by the Committee of Ministersappointed by the War Cabinet on the 8th October, and had their support.In discussion, attention was drawn to two passages in the draft statement to the effect that the Minister was &quot; considering with hiscolleagues &quot; what improvements could be made in the war-timemachinery for the operational control of the coal-mining industry:This phrase might be misinterpreted as implying that difficulties were arising from differences of view between Ministers on thisquestion, and had better be avoided. Thus, in the first passage theMinister should substitute some such phrase as &quot; this question has- been kept constantly under review by His Majesty&apos;s Government,and the War Cabinet will not fail to make such changes as may befound necessary.....&quot;   This statement should also be linked up with the undertakings given in the course of the Debate on theWhite Paper (Cmd. 6364) on the 11th June, 1942, that the positionwould be reviewed if experience showed that the dual position ofcolliery managements was defeating the objects of the new systemof control.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft statement annexed to W.P. (43) 451subject to amendment on the lines indicated at &quot;X&quot;above.
6. The War Cabinet considered a Report by the Committee on electoral Machinery (W.P. (43) 440) seeking approval of thefollowing recommendations : ^ -(i) A two days&apos; Debate on the electoral system should be heldin the House of Commons early in the new Session, ona Motion for the appointment of a Speaker&apos;s conference to consider questions of electoral reform.(ii) The proposal to hold such a Debate should be announced in the near future. (A draft of the proposed announce-ment was annexed to a further Note by the HomeSecretary (W.P. (43) 452) which was also before the WarCabinet.)(iii) The Motion for the appointment of a Speakers conference should include a list of the questions to be considered bythe Conference. This should include methods of election,which would cover proportional representation; but itwould be open to any Members to move an Amendmentfor the omission of this or any other item from the list.(iv) The whole question of  redistribution should  also bereferred to the Speakers Conference for urgent con-sideration and early report, primarily with a view to obtaining the assistance of the Conference in framing the directions to the Boundary Commissioners.Points in discussion were :  (a) Should the Government defer bringing forward a specificmotion for the appointment of a Speaker&apos;s Conference until theyhad had an opportunity to judge from the Debate whether this wasthe general desire of tlie House ?The War Cabinet were informed that it was already known that there would be general support for the appointment of such aConference. Further, this was a matter on which the Governmentshould give a lead, rather than appear to be giving way to pressureexercised in the Debate.  This view was accepted.(b) It was proposed in the Report that methods of electionshould be included in the list of questions for consideration by the speaker&apos;s Conference. This would give rise to the question whetherthe Speaker&apos;s Conference should consider proportional representa-tion (or the alternative vote). The Government would have toconsider what attitude they would take to an amendment to preclude the Conference from considering proportional representation.Should it be left to a free vote of the House ?This point was left for later decision.The Secretary of State for Air said that, in his view, the same procedure must apply to all questions arising out of the terms ofreference to the Speaker&apos;s Conference; and that it would not be appropriate for the Government to say that some should, but othersshould not, be left to a free vote of the House.(c) It was suggested that it would be more appropriate (inparagraph 2 of the Report) to speak of &quot; the franchise &quot; and not&quot; the reform of the franchise.&quot;The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations made in W.P. (43) 440,subject to the points mentioned at (b) and (c) above.(2) Took note that the proposal to hold a Debate on electoral reform would be announced at an early date in the termsof the draft annexed to W.P. (43) 452.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,11th October, 1943.
